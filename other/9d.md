# 超譯老子

一般做古文研究，係講究訓古考據，理論上所有論點都有文獻依歸。

但由於近年發現「過去係唔存在」，幾千年前發生過啲乜，根本係唔會有客觀定案。

尤其《道德經》呢類連起源都唔清唔楚，作者同成書故事都流於傳說，其實某程度上可以話本書係石頭爆出嚟，來歷不明。而當中內容，又係中華玄學嘅頂點。

喺咁嘅情況下，嘗試用文字考據方式去解讀作品，似乎係緣木求魚。

所以「超譯」就啱喇。

「超譯」其實唔係真係咁過份。大家都知道《道德經》版本眾多，唔同版本嘅內容甚至可以完全相反，成書兩千幾年嚟大家抄錯經文、注錯解釋，甚至為各種理由撰改內容，咩都可能發生。

所以要還原經文原意，最好嘅方法，梗係靠「源頭」嘅大能，由頭寫返個正確版本出嚟。

無所憑靠咁寫，我哋平時已經做緊。但《道德經》本身有傳承嘅力量，食得唔好嘥，作為一個玄學嘅綱目啱啱好。

所以「超譯」就啱喇。


一般嘅翻譯，通常係作者對內容嘅認知比較全面，所以譯者喺認知未及得上作者嘅情況下，只能夠嚴謹就住文字翻譯。嚴謹嘅作用，係保障譯文唔會偏離作者意圖，亦即係唔會偏離作者所見到嘅真相。但《道德經》既無作者，亦無客觀真相，所以「超譯」，*以至任何翻譯*，都係考譯者嘅功夫。

二十年前嘗試過搞唔撚掂，且看隔咗咁耐，我有冇進步。呢個係對自己嘅測驗嚟。

------------------

The path you walk is not eternal;
The names you give things are not constant.

In the beginning, there were no names;
Everything came to be when they were given names.

Therefore, without names, wonders can be observed;
And with names, we see the boundary of things.
These two are the complements of the same mystery.
This mystery feeds on itself, and it is the source of all wonder.

-

Everyone knows beauty as beauty, because of appalling things;
They know good as good, because of evil.
Therefore, to have and to lack are brought about together;
Ease and difficulty are brought about together;
Long and short are measured together;
High and low, Music and noise, front and back,
they are opposite sides of the same thing.

Therefore enlightened masters do not act on aspirations, and they do not teach using words and contrasts.

Everything in the universe
function without self-aggrandizement;
create without owning;
act without clinging on;
achieve without revel.

Only those who do not cling on will not be vanquished.

-

The Dao is ever-flowing, so it never ruptures.
It is the fountainhead of everything in the world.

It rounds sharp corners,
detangles complexities,
mellows brightnesses,
and settles with dusts.

In its deep serenity, it peacefully exists without disturbance.

I do not know who created it;
It seems to have come before the gods.

Heaven and Earth are not benevolent;
they treat everything as fuel.
Just like the Lords are not benevolent;
they treat commoners as fuel.

Is the world not like a furnace?
Nothing happens if you keep still,
but if you move air through the bellows,
it becomes hot.

The more you speak, the worse off you become.
It is wise to keep a neutral balance.

-

The flowing cradle;
mysterious divinity;
unyielding immortality -
These give rise to the Mystery.

Where the Mystery arises,
it is the source of the Heaven and Earth.
It is a gentle stream that flows forever,
and can never be exhausted.

-

Heaven and Earth last for a long time.
They don't try to make themselves last,
so they last.

Therefore,
the enlightened leave themselves behind,
so that they are in the lead;
they relinquish their bodies,
thus they survive.

Because they are selfless,
everything is theirs to have.

-

The highest Good is like water.
Water nourishes all things
and is at peace with others,
it dwells in places where
people do not want to be,
so it is kind of like the Dao.

Be in a Good place;
Have a Good heart;
Say Good words;
Do Good deeds;

Be at peace with others,
You will have no enemies.

-

Instead of holding on and on,
it is better to let go.
If you polish a sharp edge, it will not last.
Rooms full of gold and jade, they cannot be guarded.
Pride from wealth and status will lead to one's undoing.
Let things go after your deeds are done,
this is the way of the heavens.

-

Thirty spokes attach to a hub.
Because the mortises are hollowed out,
It can be used as a wheel.

Clay is made into pottery.
Because it is hollowed out,
It can be used as a container.

Doors and windows are carved out from rocks.
Because it is hollowed out,
it can be used as a house.

Therefore, what you can have are tools;
You must make space to use them.
