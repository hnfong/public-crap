Once upon a time, a great War was fought. After countless lives lost, the High Priests of Death and Destruction reigned supreme. It was they who discovered the atom, the fundamental bits in the universe which, when split apart, resulted in pure energy. Armed with this divine knowledge, they won the war, and declared themselves the most powerful humans to ever be alive.

They were the first to be all-powerful with divine knowledge. So vast was their knowledge that they surpassed even the Almighty God. And hence the Cult of the Atomists was formed. It was the only sanctioned religion among the gentle class.

And hence, the Holy Book is, of course, to be rewritten. From the first chapters.

In the beginning, they said, was no man nor god, but atoms. The very things that they worshipped. Atoms were undoubtedly first.

But for how long? The atoms donâ€™t say. So the High Priests, dressed in ceremonial white robes and round spectacles, looked into the stars for guidance. They peered through gigantic crystal lenses, and wrote down their observations in ancient runes and symbols. Usually Greek.

They carefully observed the skies for decades, and discovered universal laws and constants that would never, ever, ever have changed since universe came to be. With unshakable conviction in these laws, together with advanced numerology techniques they learned from the merchants, they calculated the time from when the whole world would be the size of just one atom.

13 billion revolutions around the sun, they said. It was about right. Contrary evidence would have been long gone, they would not make the same mistakes as their predecessors who foolishly posited a couple thousand.

The Priests proclaimed this result to the whole world. It was a gift from the Cult of Atomists to mankind, and was to be received without a question. Not even the followers of the old Gods doubted them, because surely, if these people had the power to destroy the world, they would know a thing or two about how long the universe existed?

And hence the myth of the Big Bang was formed.

People say only barbarians practice blood sacrifice, but nonetheless, we would not have been gifted this Truth without the death and destruction in the War. Treasure this Truth in remembrance of those who died for it.
