# Some notes on concept of Time

It seems time is really a tool created to experience free will.

If we know everything, there is no time. Because we know what is happened.

With time, it implies we do not know everything. This is the condition for free will, because the mechanism of free will is going from not knowing what is happened to knowing what is happened (which we call "making a decision"). Time only flows when the not-known becomes known.

(Of course, most people do not experience everything that happens in the universe as a "personal" decision, but this is a most unscientific claim since even reductionist science tells us that everything is connected and the processes that decide where you eat lunch is essentially the same that decides the lottery numbers.)

Now that we've put all the big traditionally-esoteric pieces together, where does this leave computation? Why are there problems that seem to be hard to decide? What is significant about this process or ritual of knowing?

This question about time and computation might have an answer that involves practical and theoretical difficulties with computation at larger time scales. IMHO, the theory of computation actually breaks down when viewed subjectively.

Just looking at a computation project as an exercise in engineering, if we wanted to spend 100 years to compute a result (assuming Moore's law has broken down so running the computation for a longer time is the only way to calculate important things), it's actually quite hard to ensure the end result is the actual flawless answer.

Of course we can check the answer if the problem is in NP, but that's just more evidence that in a subjective world that we can't imagine now, P might actually equal NP after all.

So if we can't check the answer, the engineering required to ensure the computer does not somehow "degrade" over decades of running could become exponentially hard as compute time runs longer. In a subjective world, I'd argue that the fundamental glitches at this timescale could make a "100-year long computation" impossible.

And given that under a subjective interpretation the past does not exist, there is actually no way to trust computed result that started 100 years ago unless you could check its correctness.

FWIW I think I raised this "can you really calculate something for a non-trivial amount of time" issue in some past writings. Damn. Things are kinda lining up perfectly...
