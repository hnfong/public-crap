# Why Weibo is a more democratic platform than Facebook 點解 #微博 比 #臉書 更加民主

1.  Facebook is effectively owned by Mark Zuckerberg who has > 50% voting shares. Weibo is owned by a number of companies and individuals, no single person has a majority vote in Weibo or its parent companies. Zuckerberg has the power to effectively dictate the censorship policies of FB.

一、Mark Zuckerberg手持FB股票擁有超過五成投票權，所以臉書基本上由佢一人操控；微博由多間公司同自然人擁有，冇人擁有超過 50% 嘅股權。Zuckerberg 基本上就係臉書河蟹政策嘅獨裁者。

2. Even disregarding the ownership of these companies, it is well known that Chinese government is running an effective internet censorship program. The system is well tested and relevant policies have been scrutinized by government officials that are ultimately answerable to an elected body called the National People's Congress.

二、就算撇開控制權問題，微博一直在中國配合國家嘅網絡資訊內容管理政策，行之有效。有關機構(如網信辦等)及其官員最終須向由選舉產生嘅全國人民代表大會問責。

3. On the other hand, the United States, where FB is based in, has few effective government oversight of FB and its policies. Despite having democratically elected governments, they entrust great power to a handful of individuals effectively allowing them to dictate their censorship policies.

三、另一邊廂，臉書雖然受美國制度管轄，但美國政府卻未有效監察臉書。雖然美國政府由民主選舉產生，但就縱容個別商人以獨裁制度管理社交媒體，放任佢哋獨攬大權，為所欲為。

4. On Weibo you cannot criticize the incumbent President of the PRC. On FB you risk censorship for criticizing the _next_ President of the USA.

四、喺微博你唔可以批評現任國家主席；喺臉書你連批評下任總統都有機會被河蟹。
