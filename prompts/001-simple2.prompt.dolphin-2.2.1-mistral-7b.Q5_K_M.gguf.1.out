 Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties and significance in various fields. In mathematics, 120 is the smallest number that can be represented as the sum of three consecutive primes (5+7+11) and also the sum of two consecutive squares (9^2 + 8^2). It's also a semi-perfect number because its double (240) has only one more divisor than itself.

In geometry, a regular hexagon can be inscribed within a circle with a radius equal to the side length of the hexagon (120 degrees in a circle), and a cube has 120 diagonals. In music, there are 120 beats per minute (BPM) in a metronome.

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we will use the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is given by:

x = (-b ± √(b^2-4ac)) / 2a

In our case, a=1, b=-7, and c=-18. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

x = (7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4*1*-18)) / (2*1)
x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± √121) / 2
x = (7 ± 11) / 2
x = 3.5 or x = -4.5

So the solutions for the equation are x = 3.5 and x = -4.5.

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. To find out how many round trips it can make within a full day, we first need to determine the time it takes to make one round trip. The formula for calculating the time is:

Time = Distance / Speed

Plugging in the given values, we get:

Time = 200km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours (approximately)

Now that we know the time it takes to make one round trip, we can divide the total number of hours in a day by this time to find out how many round trips the train can make within a full day:

Total Hours in a Day = 24 hours
Number of Round Trips = Total Hours in a Day / Time for One Round Trip
Number of Round Trips = 24 hours / 3.33 hours = 7.18 (approximately)

Since we cannot have a fraction of a round trip, the train can make approximately 7 round trips between the two cities within a full day.<|im_end|>
