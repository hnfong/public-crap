### Response:

Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties and significance in mathematics. Here are some of them:

* It is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any other number smaller than itself. Specifically, it has 16 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
* It is a triangular number, which means it can be represented as a triangle with dots or balls arranged in rows with the first row having one dot, the second row having two dots, and so on until the nth row has n dots. The sum of all these dots gives us a triangular number. For example, 120 can be represented as a triangle with 10 rows (1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 = 55), and if you take two such triangles, you get 120 dots arranged in the shape of a hexagon.
* It is also a tetrahedral number, which means it can be represented as a pyramid with a triangular base. The first few tetrahedral numbers are 1, 4, 10, 20, and 35. The sum of the first five triangular numbers gives us 1+4+10+20+35 = 70, but we need to double this number to get a tetrahedron because each layer of balls in the pyramid is shared by two adjacent tetrahedra. Thus, 120 is the fifth tetrahedral number (70*2 = 140).

Q2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a. In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18.

Using the quadratic formula, we get:

x = [7 ± sqrt((-7)^2 - 4*1*(-18))] / 2*1
= [7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)] / 2
= [7 ± sqrt(121)] / 2
= [7 ± 11] / 2

Thus, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: If a train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart, then it takes t = d/s = 200/60 = 10/3 hours for a one-way trip. Since there are 24 hours in a day and we want to know how many round trips the train can make within a full day, we need to divide the total time available by the time it takes for one round trip.

A round trip would take twice the time of a one-way trip, so the time taken for one round trip is 10/3 * 2 = 20/3 hours. In a full day, there are 24*3 = 72/3 hours available (since we're working in units of thirds of an hour).

Now we can calculate the number of round trips: n = t_total / t_round trip = (72/3) / (20/3) = 72/20 = 3.6. Since a train cannot make 0.6 of a round trip, it will only be able to complete 3 full round trips between the two cities within a full day.
