What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)

This Python program runs an infinite loop where it multiplies `x` by `1.001` in each iteration. Since the value of `x` keeps increasing but never reaches infinity, the loop would run indefinitely if not interrupted. However, in practice, floating-point operations have a limited precision, so eventually, `x` will become sufficiently large that it will appear to be equal to `math.inf` due to rounding errors.

In most practical implementations, this program will not produce any output because it gets stuck in an infinite loop. But theoretically, if the loop were to break at some point, the value of `x` would be a very large number close to infinity.
