Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

Yo, let me break it down for you, homie,
The Fed is like a boss in the game of finance, see?
It controls the money supply and interest rates, my guy,
Helps keep the economy flowing smooth as honey pie.

Think of the Fed as your financial advisor on deck,
Making sure the market stays balanced and not reckless,
They're like a referee in the game of economics,
Keeping everything fair and square for all the players in their system.

The Federal Reserve is made up of a group of banks,
That work together to make decisions that don't stank,
They set the rules and guidelines so we can play nice,
Making sure everyone gets along without any fights.

So next time you hear about the Fed on the news,
Just remember they're looking out for the greater good crew,
Keeping our economy strong and stable as a rock,
Making sure that money in your pocket ain't gone shock.
