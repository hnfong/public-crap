Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell,
'Bout the Fed, and the role they dwell,
In the game of money, they're the ones in charge,
Controllin' the flow, like a DJ on the discharge,

They're like the referee, makin' sure the game is fair,
Keepin' the economy movin', without a single care,
Inflatin' the money supply, or tightenin' the reins,
They're the ones who decide, when it's time to change the pace,

Think of 'em like the conductor, on the economic train,
Makin' sure it's on track, and the passengers ain't in pain,
They're watchin' the market, like a hawk in the sky,
Adjustin' the interest rates, to keep the economy fly,

They're also like the bank, for the government too,
Lendin' 'em cash, when they need it, like a homie who's true,
They're the ones who print the money, like a stamp on a mail,
Makin' sure the economy's strong, like a solid chain,

Now, when the economy's hot, and the money's flowin' free,
They might raise the rates, to slow it down, you see,
And when it's slowin' down, and the money's gettin' tight,
They might lower the rates, to get the economy right,

So, that's the Fed, in a nutshell, or a rap,
They're the ones who keep the economy movin', like a map,
They're like the quarterbacks, callin' the shots,
Makin' sure the economy's strong, like a solid rock!
