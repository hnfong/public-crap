Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell 'Bout a crew that runs the money game, it's epic as hell They're called the Fed, short for Federal Reserve Like the boss of banks, they set the rules, yo, observe!
They're like DJs spinning economy tracks Controlling interest rates, that's where they attack If the scene is slow, they drop it low, make it cheaper To encourage spending, that's how they stimulate, homie, no feather
Inflation too high? They hike it up, my G Got to keep物价from goin' up like a teasing Tweety bird, see? Balance is key, like a sick verse and beat, yeah
They're the bank's bank, when others need some juice They lend reserves, smooth out the cash, no excuse In times of crisis, they step in as the savior Like a superhero, saving the day, no need to haver'
The Fed also monitors, keeps an eye on all The financial system, gotta prevent that fall If things get crazy, like a wild party, they intervene So the whole economy don't crash like a broken screen
So remember this, whenever you count your dough The Federal Reserve is how it flows, yo They set the rules, keep it stable, that's their role Gotta keep the hip-hop economy on a roll!
