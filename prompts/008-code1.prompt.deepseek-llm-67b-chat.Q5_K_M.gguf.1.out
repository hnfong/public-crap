Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Sure, here are implementations for both Bubble Sort and Merge Sort in Python:
```python
# Implementation of Bubble Sort
def bubbleSort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    
    # Traverse through all array elements
    for i in range(n-1):
        # Last i elements are already sorted, so we only need to traverse the unsorted part
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:  # Swap if current element is greater than next one
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
                
# Example usage of Bubble Sort:
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
bubbleSort(arr)
print("Sorted array is:", arr)
```
```python
# Implementation of Merge Sort
def mergeSort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        # Find the middle point and divide the array into two halves
        mid = len(arr)//2
        
        leftHalf = arr[:mid]
        rightHalf = arr[mid:]
  
        # Sort first half
        mergeSort(leftHalf)
  
        # Sort second half
        mergeSort(rightHalf)
  
        i = j = k = 0
          
        while i < len(leftHalf) and j < len(rightHalf):
            if leftHalf[i] < rightHalf[j]:
                arr[k] = leftHalf[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = rightHalf[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1
  
        # Checking if any element was left in first half or second half
        while i < len(leftHalf):
            arr[k] = leftHalf[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1
          
        while j < len(rightHalf):
            arr[k] = rightHalf[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
  
# Example usage of Merge Sort:
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
mergeSort(arr)
print("Sorted array is:", arr)
```
Discussion and Comparison:
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. Bubble Sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), making it inefficient on large lists.

Merge sort, on the other hand, is a divide and conquer algorithm that splits the input into two halves, sorts them individually, then merges them back together in order. This process is repeated for each half until the entire list is sorted. Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n), making it more efficient than Bubble sort on large lists.

In summary, while both algorithms accomplish the same task (sorting an array), they do so with different levels of efficiency. If you're dealing with small arrays or performance isn't as important, Bubble Sort may be suitable due to its simplicity and ease-of-implementation. However, for larger lists where performance matters, Merge Sort is a more efficient choice.
