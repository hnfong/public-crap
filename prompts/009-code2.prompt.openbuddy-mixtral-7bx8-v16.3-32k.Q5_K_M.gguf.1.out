Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a file directly without loading all lines into memory at once, we need to design an efficient way to access specific positions within the file. We can achieve this by keeping track of two pointers: `start` and `end`, which point to the beginning and end of the current search range in the file.

Here's a step-by-step approach to implement the function `binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target or insertion point:

1. Read the first line from the file into a variable called `start`. This will be our initial search range. Set `end = -1`, indicating we haven't read any more lines yet.
2. Calculate the midpoint of the current range by summing the start and end pointers, dividing by 2, rounding down if necessary: `mid = (start + end) // 2`
3. Seek to the calculated midpoint in the file using `file.seek(mid)`. Read the line at this position into a variable called `current_line`.
4. Compare the target with the current line and update our search range accordingly:
   - If `target == current_line`, we have found the element, so return its position (`start + mid`).
   - If `target > current_line`, set `start = mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, if `end != -1`, set `end = mid - 1`; otherwise, update `end = start`.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the search range is exhausted (i.e., `start > end`) or we find the target/insertion point. If the loop completes without finding the target, return the insertion point: `start + mid`.
6. Close the file to release any resources used during the operation.

Here's a Python implementation of this algorithm:
```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        start = 0
        end = -1
        
        while True:
            if not (start <= end):
                return start + ((-end) // 2)
            
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            file.seek(mid)
            current_line = file.readline()
            
            if target == current_line:
                return start + mid
            elif target > current_line:
                start = mid + 1
            else:
                end = mid - 1
```
This function uses binary search to efficiently find the position of a given `target` in a text file containing sorted names. It returns either the position of the target or the insertion point where it would be inserted if added to the file while maintaining its lexicographical order.
