What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The eventual output of this Python program will be an extremely large number (i.e., a number very close to infinity) due to the infinite loop in the while statement. The value of x is incremented by 1 every iteration and it never stops because math.inf represents positive infinity.
