Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

 Yes, there are inputs that will lead to the program printing "Done". Here are two examples:

1. Input: 0.5

Explanation: The while loop condition `x < math.inf` is initially True when `x = 0`, and since `inc` is set to 0.5, the increment of x will be by 0.5 each time the loop runs. Eventually, `x` will become greater than or equal to `math.inf`, at which point the while loop will terminate, and "Done" will be printed.

2. Input: -1.0

Explanation: The while loop condition `x < math.inf` is initially True when `x = 0`, and since `inc` is set to -1.0, the increment of x will be by -1.0 each time the loop runs. Eventually, `x` will become less than or equal to `-math.inf`, at which point the while loop will terminate, and "Done" will be printed.
