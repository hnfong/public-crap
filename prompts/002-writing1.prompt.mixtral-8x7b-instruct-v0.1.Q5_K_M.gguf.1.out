 [/INST] Once upon a time, in a small village nestled at the foot of a great mountain, lived a young girl named Maya. She was known for her bright eyes and an infectious laugh that could light up any room. However, she often felt lonely as she didn't have many friends to play with.

One day, while lying on her bed and staring at the ceiling, she noticed a small hole in her pillow. As she looked closer, she saw a tiny cloud escaping through it. She gently placed her hand over the hole, trapping the cloud inside. A smile spread across her face as an idea popped into her head.

"Maybe I can keep it as my friend," she thought to herself.

Over the next few days, Maya started talking to the cloud and even gave it a name - Cloudy. She would share all her stories and secrets with Cloudy, who always listened attentively. But soon, Maya realized that something was changing. The once fluffy pillow had become flat, and Cloudy was getting smaller with each passing day.

She went to the village elder, who explained that Cloudy needed to be free and couldn't survive in such a small space. Maya felt a pang of guilt for keeping her friend captive, but she also didn't want to let go.

The elder saw her dilemma and said, "Sometimes, love means letting go of something you cherish for the sake of its happiness."

With tears in her eyes, Maya released Cloudy back into the sky. The villagers watched as a single ray of sunlight broke through the clouds, illuminating Maya's tear-streaked face. It was a beautiful sight, and the villagers knew that they had just witnessed something special.

Maya learned an important lesson about love that day - it is not about possessing or owning someone or something. Instead, it is about nurturing, caring for, and ultimately letting go when necessary. Love requires sacrifice, but it also brings joy and happiness to those who give it freely. And even though Cloudy was no longer with her physically, Maya knew that the love they shared would always remain in her heart.
