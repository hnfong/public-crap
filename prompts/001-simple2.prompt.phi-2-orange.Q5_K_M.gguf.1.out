Answer to Q1:
The number 120 is significant due to its unique properties and appearances in various mathematical contexts. Some of its interesting properties include being divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120. It has the following prime factorization:
1 * 2^3 * 3 * 5
120 is also a highly composite number; it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer except for 1 itself (which has only 1 divisor). Moreover, 120 is an excellent first harmonic number in music theory and appears in many arithmetic progressions.

Answer to Q2:
To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can factor it or use the quadratic formula. Here are the steps for factoring:
1. Find two numbers that multiply to give (-18)(1) = -18 and add up to -7. The factors are 9 and -2 because (9)(-2) = -18 and 9 + (-2) = 7.
2. Rewrite the equation as follows: (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0.
3. Apply the zero product property, which states that if ab = 0, then either a = 0 or b = 0. In this case, we have x - 9 = 0 or x + 2 = 0.
4. Solve for x in each equation: x = 9 or x = -2.
So, the solutions to the given quadratic equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

Answer to Q3:
To find out how many round trips a train can make between two cities within a full day, we need to calculate the total distance covered in one round trip first and then divide it by the average speed of the train. Then, we'll check if the quotient is less than or equal to 24 hours (one full day).

First, let's find out how long it takes for the train to travel between the two cities:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 km / 60 km/h
Time = 3.33 hours (approximately)
Since the time stationed in the cities is negligible, we'll only consider the time spent traveling between them.

Now, let's find out how far the train can go in one round trip:
Distance per Round Trip = 2 * Distance between Cities
Distance per Round Trip = 2 * 200 km
Distance per Round Trip = 400 km

Finally, let's calculate how many round trips the train can make within a full day:
Number of Round Trips = Total Time / Time per Round Trip
Since there are 24 hours in a full day:
Number of Round Trips = 24 hours / 3.33 hours (approximately)
Number of Round Trips â‰ˆ 7.23
Since we cannot have a fraction of a round trip, the train can make at most 7 round trips within a full day.

So, the answer is: The train can make at most 7 round trips between the two cities within a full day. (Note: This result might not be precise due to rounding errors.)
