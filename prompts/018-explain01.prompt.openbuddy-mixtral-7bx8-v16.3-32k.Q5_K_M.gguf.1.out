Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

Yo, yo! Listen up, it's time to break it down
Got a hot topic on my mind I gotta lay it out loud
I wanna talk about the Fed, yeah you heard me right
It's that institution with some serious clout and might

Now let me tell ya how they roll their dice
With interest rates, they play their part to set the price
Of borrowing money in this game we call life
They tweak it up or down, trying to avoid strife

Inflation's what they aim to control
Keep prices stable like a pro with a goal
To keep our economy from falling apart
Like an expert DJ spinning tracks in the heart

Of the music industry, making sure we never stop
The Fed's their name and adjusting rates is their game plan that they got
So next time you hear about them on the news
Just know they're working hard to keep our economy from snoozing.
