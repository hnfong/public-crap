China's National People's Congress (NPC) is like a big group of people who make rules and decisions for their country, which is China. Imagine you and your friends have a big playgroup where you decide on what games to play, how to play them, and when to play them. The NPC is kind of like that, but instead of playing games, they decide on important things like how to make their country better, how to take care of people, and how to make sure everyone is happy.

These decisions are usually made every few years, just like how your playgroup might decide on new games or rules each time you have your meeting. They talk to each other and share their ideas, and then they vote on what they think is best for their country. It's a big responsibility, but it's important because these decisions affect a lot of people.

Think of the NPC as a big team of people working together to make sure everyone in China has a good life, kind of like how you and your friends work together to have fun and play nice. So, even though you live in London, it's important to know about the NPC because they help make decisions that can affect people all around the world, including you.
