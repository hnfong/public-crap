Once upon a time in a small village nestled at the foot of a mountain range lived two brothers named Tom and Jack. They were as different as day and night – Tom was kind-hearted while Jack could be quite selfish. Despite their differences, they both loved each other deeply, like pillows that hold together despite being tossed around every now and then.

One summer afternoon, the sky was painted with cotton candy clouds and the brothers decided to go for a walk in the meadow nearby. As they walked hand in hand, Jack suddenly fell down on his knees, clutching his stomach. Tom, concerned about his brother's health, asked him what had happened but Jack could only muster up exaggerated moans of pain.

Tom quickly called out to their mother and she came rushing over with a worried look on her face. As they all huddled around Jack, trying to figure out the cause of his sudden discomfort, Tom noticed that he was holding onto one hand more tightly than the other. Curiosity piqued, he gently took hold of Jack's tightened fist and carefully opened it up. Inside were two small white pills – they had been stolen from their mother's medicine cabinet!

Tom realized that Jack, feeling left out on a recent family trip to the beach, had exaggerated his pain in order to get attention. With tears streaming down his cheeks, Tom embraced his brother and said, "I love you, no matter what." The brothers sat there under the cloudless sky for what seemed like an eternity, holding onto each other as if their lives depended on it.

From that day forward, Jack learned the importance of love – how sometimes, we all need someone to hold onto when life gets tough and how important it is to be honest with those who care about us. And Tom? He continued to shower his brother with kindness, knowing deep down inside that their bond was as strong as a cloud holding its shape in an otherwise clear blue sky.
