What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)

The eventual output of the given Python program will be an error or a system crash due to an infinite loop, as the condition `x < math.inf` will always be true, causing the while loop to continue indefinitely. This is because the variable `x` is incremented by 1.0 in each iteration, but it can never reach infinity, which is an unbounded upper limit.

However, in practice, the program may eventually crash due to memory limitations or an overflow error, as the value of `x` keeps increasing with each iteration.</s>
