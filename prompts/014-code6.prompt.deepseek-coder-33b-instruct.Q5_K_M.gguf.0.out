### Instruction:

Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.


### Response:

No, it is not possible to enter a number value that would cause this program to print "Done". The reason for this is due to the nature of math.inf in Python. Math.inf is considered as a floating point positive infinity. Thus, when the increment (inc) is added to x, there's no way x could equal or exceed infinity since infinity is infinite.

Therefore, the program will never reach the print statement and it will continue indefinitely. 

You can check this by entering 0 as an input, or any negative number because we are adding inc to x which will always be less than math.inf.
