Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

 Python Implementation of Bubble Sort:
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
    return arr
```
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. Its average and worst case complexity is O(n^2) where n is the number of items being sorted.

Python Implementation of Merge Sort:
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i = j = 0
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    result.extend(left[i:])
    result.extend(right[j:])
    return result
```
Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a sorted list of one element is considered a sorted list). Then repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. The average and worst case complexity of Merge Sort is O(n log n) where n is the number of items being sorted.

Comparison:
- Bubble Sort is simple to understand and implement, but it has poor performance for large data sets, as its average and worst-case time complexity is O(n^2). It is not suitable for large data sets or real-time applications.
- Merge Sort, on the other hand, is more complex to implement and requires extra space (O(n)) to store temporary arrays during the merging process, but it has a better average and worst-case time complexity of O(n log n). This makes it suitable for large data sets or real-time applications where performance is critical.

In summary, Merge Sort is generally preferred over Bubble Sort due to its better time complexity, especially when dealing with large data sets. However, if memory constraints are a concern and the input size is relatively small, Bubble Sort might be more appropriate due to its simplicity and lower space requirements (O(1)).
