 Q1: 1+1=?

The answer is 2.

Q2: 6*7=?

The answer is 42.

Q3: 83*59=?

The answer is 50978.

Q4: 349*683=?

The answer is 188839.

Q5: 6043*7489=?

The answer is 42726973.

Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.

We need to isolate x on one side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract 3x from both sides of the equation.

(3x + 7) - (3x) = 22 - 3x

This simplifies to:

3x = -5x

Now, to find x, we divide both sides by -5.

(3x)/-5 = x/(-5)

This gives us the equation for x:

3x = 1

Therefore, the value of x is 1.

Q7: What is 25% of 80?

We need to find out how much money it costs to make 80 pizza slices by 25%. We can do this by multiplying the cost of one pizza slice by the percentage.

(80 pizza slices * $10/slice) * (25% / 100%) = $30

Therefore, 30 is the amount it costs to make 80 pizza slices.<|im_end|>
