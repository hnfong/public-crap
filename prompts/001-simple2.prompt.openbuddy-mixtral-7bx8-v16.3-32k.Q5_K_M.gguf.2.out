Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties and significance in various fields. Here are some of them:

1. Sum of divisors: The sum of the first four triangular numbers (1, 3, 6, 10) is 20, which is half of 120. This means that if you multiply any number from 1 to 10 by its complementary pair (e.g., 1x20, 2x15), the result will be a multiple of 120.

2. Factors: The number 120 has 16 divisors in total: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120. This is the maximum number of divisors any number less than 120 has (excluding perfect squares).

3. Perfect number: A perfect number is a positive integer that equals the sum of its proper divisors (numbers less than itself). The smallest perfect number, 6, can be expressed as half of the product of its prime factors (2 x 3 = 6). Similarly, 120 divided by half of its prime factorization (2^2 x 5 x 3) also equals the sum of its divisors.

Q2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:

\[ x = \frac{-(-7) \pm \sqrt{(-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18)}}{2(1)} \]

Simplifying this expression results in two solutions for x:

\[ x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{49 + 72}}{2} \]
\[ x = \frac{7 \pm \sqrt{121}}{2} \]
\[ x = \frac{7 \pm 11}{2} \]

So the two solutions are:

\[ x_1 = \frac{7 - 11}{2} = -\frac{4}{2} = -2 \]
\[ x_2 = \frac{7 + 11}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9 \]

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = -2 and x = 9.

Q3: First, we need to find out how long it takes for the train to travel between the two cities once. The distance between the two cities is 200 km, and the average speed of the train is 60 km/h. To calculate the time taken, divide the distance by the speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{200}{60} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{10}{3} \]
\[ \text{Time} \approx 3.33 \text{ hours} \]

Now, we need to determine how many round trips the train can make within a full day (24 hours). To do this, divide the total time available by the time it takes for one trip:

\[ \text{Number of round trips} = \frac{\text{Total Time}}{\text{Time per trip}} \]
\[ \text{Number of round trips} = \frac{24}{3.33} \]
\[ \text{Number of round trips} \approx 7.19 \]

Since the train can't make a fraction of a trip, it will complete approximately 7 full round trips within a day. If we consider that each "round trip" includes traveling to and from one city twice (once in each direction), then the total number of cities visited would be double: 14 cities.
