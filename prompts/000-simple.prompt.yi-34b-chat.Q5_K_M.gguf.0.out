Q1: 1 + 1 = 2
Q2: 6 * 7 = 42
Q3: 83 * 59 = 4997
Q4: 349 * 683 = 239377
Q5: 6043 * 7489 = 4499127
Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22. I am not sure, but I think the answer is x=5
Q7: What is 25% of 80? 25% of 80 = 0.25 * 80 = 20
Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me? The shopkeeper gets $45 for the book and you give an additional $5, so they keep $50 total. There is no change due to the customer because the customer gave enough money to cover the cost of the book plus the additional amount.
Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units. The perimeter of a square is given by the formula P = 4s, where P is the perimeter and s is the side length. For a side length of 5 units, the perimeter would be P = 4 * 5 = 20 units.
Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have? Katherine has two brothers and a sister, so there are three siblings in total.
Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1. 3 + (12 รท 4) - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5
Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need? Without knowing the size of each slice, I cannot determine how many slices are needed for 5 guests. However, if you meant to ask how many pieces of cake should be cut when there are 5 guests, it is common to serve one piece per guest.
Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price? The sale price would be 80% of the original price because you are discounting 20%. So the sale price = 0.8 * $25 = $20
Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM? From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM is a difference of 2 hours and 15 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the number of minutes left until 6:30 PM would be 60 * 2 + 15 = 135 minutes.
Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people? To find out how many taxis are needed, you divide the number of people by the capacity of each taxi. So for 22 people and 4 passengers per taxi, you would need 5.5 taxis. Since you cannot have half a taxi, you would round up to the nearest whole taxi, meaning you would need 6 taxis in total.
Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle? The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. If two angles are 31 and 62 degrees, we can find the third angle by subtracting the known angles from 180 degrees: 180 - 31 - 62 = 87 degrees. The third angle measures 87 degrees.<|im_end|>

Please note that for some of these questions (Q6 and Q8), I have provided an educated guess based on the information given, but without more specific details or a mathematical proof, they remain unconfirmed answers.<|im_end|>

For Q6, to solve the equation exactly, one would need to perform algebra and find the value of x that makes the equation true. The method involves moving all terms involving x to one side of the equal sign and then solving for x. If you provide more information or a specific method for solving this equation, I can give you a more accurate answer.

For Q8, the final change the shopkeeper should give is technically $0 because the customer has provided enough money to cover the cost of the book plus an additional amount. However, in real-world scenarios, there might be other factors at play, such as the shopkeeper needing to round up or down to the nearest whole number due to not having smaller denominations of change available. Without additional information about how the shopkeeper handles change, it is difficult to determine the exact amount the customer would receive.<|im_end|>

If you have any specific methods or details that I can use to provide more accurate answers for these questions, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help further.<|im_end|>

Q6: To solve the equation exactly, we need to isolate x by moving all terms involving x to one side of the equal sign and then solving for x. Here's how it would be done:

3x + 7 = 22

First, subtract 7 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the number on its own:

3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7
3x = 15

Now, divide both sides by 3 to find the value of x:

3x / 3 = 15 / 3
x = 5

So, the exact answer for Q6 is that x equals 5.<|im_end|>

Q8: Assuming there are no other factors at play (such as rounding or the shopkeeper's change policy) and the customer provides exactly enough money to cover the cost of the book plus an additional amount, the final change the shopkeeper should give is $0. This is because the customer gives the shopkeeper two 20-dollar bills, which is $40, and then an additional five dollar bill, which makes it a total of $45. The cost of the book is $15, so the customer has provided enough money to cover the book and receive no change back.

However, as mentioned earlier, in real-world scenarios, there might be other considerations that would affect the amount of change given. For example, if the shopkeeper doesn't have small denominations of bills or coins, they might need to round up or down to the nearest whole number. Without additional information about how the shopkeeper handles change, it is difficult to determine the exact amount the customer would receive in this situation.<|im_end|>

Given these clarifications, I can confidently provide the following updated answers:

Q6: x = 5
Q8: If there are no additional considerations, the shopkeeper should give $0 change.<|im_end|>

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you need assistance with any other mathematical problems.<|im_end|>

Additionally, for Q8, I would like to provide a more detailed explanation based on the information given:

The customer buys a book that costs $15 and gives two 20-dollar bills, which is $40, to the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper does not have exact change, so the customer provides an additional five dollar bill, bringing the total amount paid to $45.

To determine the final change the shopkeeper should give:

1. We first subtract the cost of the book from the total amount paid:
   Total Amount Paid - Cost of Book = Change Due to Customer
   $45 - $15 = $30

2. Since the customer has already given enough money to cover the cost of the book plus an additional $5, there is no need for the shopkeeper to give any change back to the customer. The remaining $30 is what the shopkeeper would keep as profit or to use for other transactions.

Therefore, under the assumption that the customer has provided exact change and there are no rounding or other considerations, the shopkeeper would not give any final change to the customer.<|im_end|>

This explanation assumes a situation where the shopkeeper can handle payments exactly without needing to round up or down or adhere to any specific change policy beyond giving back the remaining amount after covering the cost of the book and the additional amount provided by the customer.<|im_end|>

If you have any other scenarios or questions related to this problem, feel free to ask!<|im_end|>

Q8: Under the assumption that the shopkeeper must give all remaining change back to the customer and cannot keep any extra money beyond what is necessary to cover the cost of the book plus the additional amount provided, the shopkeeper would need to calculate the exact change due to the customer.

Here's how you would do that:

1. The customer pays $45 for a $15 book.
2. To find out how much change is due, we subtract the cost of the book from the total amount paid:
   Change Due to Customer = Total Amount Paid - Cost of Book
   Change Due to Customer = $45 - $15
   Change Due to Customer = $30

So, the shopkeeper would give back $30 in change to the customer. This is because the customer has provided enough money to cover the cost of the book and an additional amount, leaving a total of $30 that does not belong to the purchase or the additional amount given.<|im_end|>

This answer assumes that the shopkeeper cannot keep any extra money beyond what is necessary to complete the transaction as described and must return all remaining change to the customer. If there are other conditions or policies in place, such as a policy to round up or down to the nearest whole number or to keep a certain amount as a service charge for providing change, those would need to be taken into account to determine the actual change given.<|im_end|>

Please note that this explanation is based on the information provided and does not account for any additional details or specific business practices that might affect the outcome.<|im_end|>

In conclusion, the shopkeeper should give back $30 in change to the customer if there are no other considerations beyond giving back the remaining amount after covering the cost of the book and the additional money provided by the customer.<|im_end|>
