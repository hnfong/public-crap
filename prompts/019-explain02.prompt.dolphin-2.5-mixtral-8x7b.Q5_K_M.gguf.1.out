 Alright kiddo, imagine you and your friends are playing together in a sandbox, right? Now, the "China's National People's Congress" is kind of like the big group of grown-ups that helps make decisions for all the kids playing in different sandboxes in China. They get together, talk, and decide things to help keep everyone safe and happy. So, they are kind of like a big team of friendly, helpful parents who take care of people living in China.
