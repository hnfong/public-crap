Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

1. Number 120 has a meaning in math as an integer that represents the sum of all even numbers up to and including 120. It is a prime number since it cannot be factored into smaller integers, and its only factorization is 2 × 3 × 5 (the digits are 2, 3, and 5).

2. Solving the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 gives us the following quadratic function:
    f(x) = (x - 2)(x - 1) - 7(x - 1) + 18 = 0
    x1 and x2 are roots of this equation.

3. If the train travels an average speed of 60 km/h between cities 1 and 2, then it can make at most two round trips in a full day within those cities. Round trip means traveling from city 1 to city 2 and back, so the total distance traveled during one round trip is twice the average speed of the train, i.e., twice the distance covered by the train in a single hour. This means that the train can make at most two such rounds in a day, because it would take twice as much time to travel that far compared to traveling only once in the same direction.

4. The number of round trips is calculated using the formula "number of round trips * average speed of the train". Since the train can make at most two such rounds per day, the total number of round trips it can make within a full day is equal to the number of times it passes through the two cities.
