Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.


### Response:

The program will only print "Done" if the `while` loop is exited, which can happen only when the value of `x` becomes greater than or equal to positive infinity (`math.inf`). However, since we are incrementing `x` by a finite amount (`inc`) at each iteration, it will never reach positive infinity and the loop will continue indefinitely. Therefore, there is no input that will lead to the output "Done".
