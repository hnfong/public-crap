Give the answer for all these questions. Provide steps. If you are not sure about the answer, you can say "I am not sure, but I think the answer is ..."

Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

 I am not sure about the significance of the number 120 and its interesting properties. However, if you are asking for a general answer about an interesting property of this number, one could say that it is divisible by all numbers from 1 to 6 (excluding itself), making it highly composite.

Q2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

x = (7 ± sqrt((-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18))) / 2(1)
x = (7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± sqrt(121)) / 2
x = (7 ± 11) / 2

So, x can be either:
x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
or
x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

The solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: To find out how many round trips a train can make between the two cities within a full day, we need to determine how long it takes to travel between the cities first.

The distance between the two cities is 200 km, and the average speed of the train is 60 km/h. To find out how long the journey takes, we can use the formula:

time = distance / speed

In this case, time = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours

Since there are 24 hours in a full day, and assuming that the train travels continuously between the cities without stopping (which is not realistic), it could make approximately 7 round trips within a full day:

(24 hours / 3.33 hours) = 7.19 ≈ 7

So, a train traveling at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200 km apart could make around 7 round trips within a full day if there is no station time and the train travels continuously without stopping.
