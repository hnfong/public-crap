<s> USER: Read the following passage, and make your best guess when (date) this was written.

```
I’ve been involved in Rust and the Rust community for many years now. Much of my work has been related to creating infrastructure for building GUI toolkits in Rust. However, I have found my frustrations with the language growing, and pine for the stable, mature foundation provided by C++.

Choice of build systems
One of the more limiting aspects of the Rust ecosystem is the near-monoculture of the Cargo build system and package manager. While other build systems are used to some extent (including Bazel when integrating into larger polyglot projects), they are not well supported by tools.

In C++, by contrast, there are many choices of build systems, allowing each developer to pick the one best suited for their needs. A very common choice is CMake, but there’s also Meson, Blaze and its variants as well, and of course it’s always possible to fall back on Autotools and make. The latter is especially useful if we want to compile Unix systems such as AIX and DEC OSF/1 AXP. If none of those suffice, there are plenty of other choices including SCons, and no doubt new ones will be created on a regular basis.

We haven’t firmly decided on a build system for the Linebender projects yet, but most likely it will be CMake with plans to evaluate other systems and migrate, perhaps Meson.

Safety
Probably the most controversial aspect of this change is giving up the safety guarantees of the Rust language. However, I do not think this will be a big problem in practice, for three reasons.

First, I consider myself a good enough programmer that I can avoid writing code with safety problems. Sure, I’ve been responsible for some CVEs (including font parsing code in Android), but I’ve learned from that experience, and am confident I can avoid such mistakes in the future.

Second, I think the dangers from memory safety problems are overblown. The Linebender projects are primarily focused on 2D graphics, partly games and partly components for creating GUI applications. If a GUI program crashes, it’s not that big a deal. In the case that the bug is due to a library we use as a dependency, our customers will understand that it’s not our fault. Memory safety bugs are not fundamentally different than logic errors and other bugs, and we’ll just fix those as they surface.

Third, the C++ language is evolving to become safer. We can use modern C++ techniques to avoid many of the dangers of raw pointers (though string views can outlive their backing strings, and closures as used in UI can have very interesting lifetime patterns). The C++ core guidelines are useful, even if they’re honored in the breach. And, as discussed in the next section, the language itself can be expected to improve.

Language evolution
One notable characteristic of C++ is the rapid adoption of new features, these days with a new version every 3 years. C++20 brings us modules, an innovative new feature, and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon. Looking forward, C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies.

By comparison, the pace of innovation in Rust has become more sedate. It used to be quite rapid, and async has been a major effort, but recently landed features such as generic associated types have more of the flavor of making combinations of existing features work as expected rather than bringing any fundamentally new capabilities; the forthcoming “type alias impl trait” is similar. Here, it is clear that Rust is held back by its commitment to not break existing code (enacted by the edition mechanism), while C++ is free to implement backwards compatibility breaking changes in each new version.

C++ has even more exciting changes to look forward to, including potentially a new syntax as proposed by Herb Sutter cppfront, and even the new C++ compatible Carbon language.

Fortunately, we have excellent leadership in the C++ community. Stroustrup’s paper on safety is a remarkably wise and perceptive document, showing a deep understanding of the problems C++ faces, and presenting a compelling roadmap into the future.

Community
I’ll close with some thoughts on community. I try not to spend a lot of time on social media, but I hear that the Rust community can be extremely imperious, constantly demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust, and denigrating all other programming languages. I will be glad to be rid of that, and am sure the C++ community will be much nicer and friendlier. In particular, the C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor.

The Rust community is also known for its code of conduct and other policies promoting diversity. I firmly believe that programming languages should be free of politics, focused strictly on the technology itself. In computer science, we have moved beyond prejudice and discrimination. I understand how some identity groups may desire more representation, but I feel it is not necessary.

Conclusion
Rust was a good experiment, and there are aspects I will look back on fondly, but it is time to take the Linebender projects to a mature, production-ready language. I look forward to productive collaboration with others in the C++ community.

We’re looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite. If you’re interested, please join our Zulip instance.

Read the passage above, and make your best guess when (date) this was written. The hint is the writing style which is strongly connected to a particular day and month. Explain your rationale. Be thoughtful and think outside the box.

ASSISTANT: Based on the content and references made in the passage, we can make an educated guess about the time frame in which it was likely written. Here are several points to consider:

1. **C++ Features**: The passage mentions C++20 features such as modules and anticipates features in C++26, which would place the writing after 2020 (since C++20 was finalized and released in 2020) and before 2026.

2. **Rust's Evolution**: The passage contrasts Rust's pace of innovation with C++'s, noting that Rust's recent features seem to be more about making existing combinations of features work as expected, which suggests that the author is writing after major Rust features have been stabilized (before 1.50 in 2022, after 1.40 in 2021).

3. **Community Dynamics**: The author's comments about the Rust community being imperious and constantly demanding projects be rewritten in Rust, and the contrast with the supposed nicer and friendlier C++ community, suggest that this is a reflection on a specific point in time where these dynamics were particularly noticeable. This is likely around the same time as the rise of discussions about rewriting projects in Rust for performance or safety reasons.

4. **Technology and Build Systems**: The mention of Cargo as the dominant build system in Rust and the comparison with various build systems in C++, along with the specific examples like CMake, Meson, and others, indicates that the author is familiar with the state of build systems around the mid-2010s to early 2020s.

5. **C++ Evolution Proposals**: The author refers to a proposal by Herb Sutter to introduce a new syntax (cppfront) and the new language Carbon, which suggests a contemporary knowledge of ongoing discussions and proposals in the C++ community, but these ideas were more prominent in the mid-2010s to early 2020s.

6. **Personal Experience**: The author's personal experience with C++, including having written code with security vulnerabilities, suggests someone with a significant history in the field who has seen the evolution of C++ and its ecosystem over time.

7. **Language Safety**: The discussion around language safety and the author's confidence in their ability to manage it implies a deep understanding of the trade-offs involved, which suggests a long-term perspective on the evolution of C++ and the comparison with Rust.

Considering all these points, the passage was likely written between 2018 and 2023, as it references the recent (at the time of writing) state of both Rust and C++, the author's personal history with the languages, and the ongoing debates within their respective communities. The writing style, which includes a critical view of community dynamics and a look forward to future developments, is reminiscent of technical blog posts or essays that often reflect on a specific moment in the history of a technology. The mention of social media interactions and the tone of the discussion suggests a contemporary perspective, but not so recent that the future developments mentioned (like C++26) are imminent.

The exact date is difficult to pinpoint without more context, but the hint about the writing style being connected to a particular day and month might refer to a specific event, release, or proposal that resonates with the content of the passage. For instance, if the C++20 standard was finalized in late 2019 or early 2020, this could be a starting point for narrowing down the date range given.</s>
