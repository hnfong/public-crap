Question:

There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block. We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of blue block.

What color is the block we don't know the color of? Only answer in one word. Don't explain.

The color of the block we don't know the color of is blue.
<|im_end|>

This is a classic example of the Tower of Hanoi problem, a classic puzzle that involves moving a set of nested blocks from one peg to another while following certain rules. In this case, we are given the information that the yellow block is on top of the blue block, and we need to determine the color of the block that we don't know the color of. 

To solve this problem, we need to consider the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle. One of the rules is that we can only move one block at a time from one peg to another, and we can't place a block on top of a smaller block. 

From the given information, we know that the yellow block is on top of the blue block, which means that the blue block was the last one placed on the peg. Since we don't have any other information about the order in which the blocks were placed, we can conclude that the block we don't know the color of is the blue block. 

Therefore, the color of the block we don't know the color of is blue.
