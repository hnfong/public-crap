Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

 Python Implementation of Bubble Sort:
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n - 1):
        swapped = False
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
                swapped = True
        if not swapped:
            break
    return arr
```

Python Implementation of Merge Sort:
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i, j = 0, 0
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
    result.extend(left[i:])
    result.extend(right[j:])
    return result
```

Comparison of Bubble Sort and Merge Sort:

Bubble sort is an easy-to-understand sorting algorithm that compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the array is sorted. The average case time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2), which makes it inefficient for large input sizes.

Merge sort is a more efficient sorting algorithm that divides an unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted). Then, it repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This single sublist is the sorted version of the original list. The time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n), making it more efficient than bubble sort for large input sizes.

In summary, although bubble sort is simpler and easier to understand, merge sort is a more efficient sorting algorithm for larger input sizes due to its lower average case time complexity.
