Given the situation, Alice's goal is to kill Orim, and Bob's goal is to prevent Orim from being killed. Let's analyze the optimal play for both players.

### Alice's Perspective

Alice has two copies of 'Kindle' in her hand. The goal is to deal damage to Orim. Here's the optimal play for Alice:

1. **First Kindle**: Alice can cast the first Kindle to deal 4 damage to Orim. This is the most straightforward and effective way to deal damage to Orim, as it directly targets the creature and uses the power of the card.

2. **Second Kindle**: After dealing 4 damage, Alice can cast the second Kindle to deal another 4 damage to Orim. This ensures that Orim is dealt a total of 8 damage, which is enough to kill it.

### Bob's Perspective

Bob has Orim, Samite Healer in play, which has the ability "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." Since Orim is untapped and has not yet been prevented, Bob can use this ability to prevent the first 3 damage dealt to Orim by Alice's first Kindle.

1. **Prevent First 3 Damage**: Bob can use Orim's ability to prevent the first 3 damage dealt by Alice's first Kindle. This means Orim will only take 1 damage from Alice's first Kindle.

2. **Prevent Second 3 Damage**: After the first 3 damage is prevented, Bob can use Orim's ability again to prevent the next 3 damage dealt by Alice's second Kindle. This means Orim will only take 1 damage from Alice's second Kindle.

### Outcome

After both Kindles are cast, Alice will have dealt a total of 8 damage to Orim. However, Bob will have prevented 6 of those 8 damage points (3 from the first Kindle and 3 from the second Kindle). Therefore, Orim will only take 2 damage from Alice's Kindles.

### Final Outcome

- **Alice**: Alice will have dealt 8 damage to Orim, but Orim will only take 2 damage, meaning Orim will be killed.
- **Bob**: Bob will have prevented 6 of the 8 damage points, meaning Orim will only take 2 damage, and Orim will be killed.

### Thought Process

- **Alice**: Alice's goal is to kill Orim. The optimal play is to cast both Kindles to deal 8 damage in total, ensuring Orim is killed.
- **Bob**: Bob's goal is to prevent Orim from being killed. The optimal play is to use Orim's ability to prevent 6 of the 8 damage points, ensuring Orim only takes 2 damage and is killed.

### Conclusion

The optimal play for Alice is to cast both Kindles, dealing 8 damage to Orim. The optimal play for Bob is to use Orim's ability to prevent 6 of the 8 damage points, ensuring Orim only takes 2 damage and is killed. [end of text]
