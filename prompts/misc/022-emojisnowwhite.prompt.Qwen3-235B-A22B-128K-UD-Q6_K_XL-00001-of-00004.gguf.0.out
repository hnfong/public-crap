👸🏻🌲✨🪞🪞🪞👑🩸💔  
Once upon a time, a queen 👸🏽‍♀️🪡🩸 wished for a daughter as white as snow ❄️, red as blood 💋, and black as ebony wood 🌌. Her wish came true 🌟, but she passed away 💀, leaving her daughter, Snow White 👸🏻, in the care of a king who soon married again 👰🏻‍♂️💍.

The new queen 👑👸🏽‍♀️🔮 had a magic mirror 🪞 that told the truth:  
_"Who's the fairest of them all?"_  
And for years, the mirror replied:  
_"Snow White, beyond the castle wall."_

But one day, the mirror whispered something different 🤫.  
_"Queen, you are the fairest now... but Snow White will soon surpass you."_  
Jealousy bloomed 🌹➡️🖤 in her heart, and she ordered a huntsman 🧝🏻‍♂️🗡️ to take Snow White into the woods 🌲🦌 and end her life 💀.

But the huntsman couldn’t do it 😢.  
He let her run 🏃🏻‍♀️💨 into the forest, where she found a tiny cottage 🏡✨ guarded by seven dwarfs 🧓🏻🧓🏽🧓🏼🧓🏾🧓🏽🧓🏿.

They welcomed her 🍲🍞🛏️💖, and she became their friend 👯‍♀️🪒🪙.  
She sang 🎶, she danced 💃, and she brought joy to their little home 🏠❤️.

But the queen 👑👸🏽‍♀️ found out Snow White lived 🪞👀😡.  
She disguised herself 🎭🧪 and brought a poisoned apple 🍎💀.

"Take a bite, dear child," she croaked.  
Snow White hesitated 🤔🍎 then took a bite... and fell into a deep sleep 💤💤🌌.

The dwarfs cried ☔🧓🏻😢 and placed her in a glass coffin 📦✨ by the woods.  
Days turned to weeks 📅🍂, weeks to years 🕰️🌲.

One day, a prince 🧚🏻‍♂️🐎 passed by.  
He saw her beauty 👁️❤️👸🏻 and kissed her gently 💋.

But it wasn’t love that woke her 🤲✨.  
It was magic 🌟🔮, the same that had blessed her at birth.  
She opened her eyes 🌅👀 and stood up, free at last 🕊️🔓.

The queen was punished ⚖️🔥, and Snow White became a queen herself 👑👸🏻🌍.  
She ruled with kindness 👐🕊️, protected the forest 🌳🦌, and never again let anyone define her beauty 🪞🚫👑.

And so, Snow White lived happily ever after 🌈🏰💖
