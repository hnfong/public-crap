Let's break down the situation and analyze the optimal plays for both Alice and Bob step by step.

### Initial State:
- **Alice**: Has two copies of Kindle in hand. Kindle is an instant that deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards.
- **Bob**: Has Orim, Samite Healer in play (untapped). Orim is a legendary creature with toughness 3, and has the ability: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."
- Bob has no cards in hand and his lands are tapped out (so he can only use abilities of permanents he controls, like Orim's ability, which requires tapping).
- It is Alice's turn, and she has sufficient mana to cast both Kindles.

### Goal:
Alice wants to kill Orim (which has toughness 3). Bob wants to prevent that if possible.

### How Kindle works:
The damage dealt by Kindle depends on the number of Kindle cards in graveyards. Initially, there are no Kindles in graveyards, so the first Kindle would deal 2 + 0 = 2 damage. If one Kindle is in a graveyard, the next deals 2 + 1 = 3 damage, and so on.

### Orim's ability:
Orim can tap to prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. This ability can be used multiple times in a turn (if Orim is untapped each time), but since Orim is only one creature and tapping is part of the cost, each activation requires tapping. So, Orim can only use this ability once per turn unless untapped by some effect (which Bob doesn't have here).

### Sequence of play:
Since it is Alice's turn, she has priority to cast instants (like Kindle) at any time she has priority. Bob can respond to her spells by activating abilities (like Orim's) if he has the opportunity (i.e., when he has priority).

Alice wants to kill Orim, which requires dealing 3 damage to it. However, Bob can use Orim to prevent damage.

### Possible scenarios:

**Option 1: Alice casts one Kindle targeting Orim.**
- Kindle is cast: X = 2 (since no Kindles in graveyards).
- Bob can respond by activating Orim's ability: tap Orim to prevent the next 3 damage this turn.
- The Kindle resolves: deals 2 damage to Orim, but 3 damage is prevented (so no damage is dealt). Orim survives.
- Now, one Kindle is in Alice's graveyard.
- Alice can cast the second Kindle: X = 2 + 1 = 3 (because one Kindle is in graveyard).
- Bob cannot respond because Orim is already tapped (and he has no other way to prevent damage). So, 3 damage is dealt to Orim, which is exactly its toughness. Orim dies.

So, if Alice casts one Kindle first, and Bob uses Orim to prevent the damage from the first one, then the second Kindle kills Orim.

But is this optimal for Bob? Could Bob choose not to use Orim's ability on the first Kindle?

If Bob does not respond to the first Kindle:
- First Kindle deals 2 damage to Orim (putting it at 1 damage marked, so it has 1 toughness left).
- Then Alice casts the second Kindle: X = 2 + 1 = 3 damage. Bob can then respond by tapping Orim to prevent 3 damage. So, the second Kindle's damage is prevented, and Orim survives with 2 damage marked (so it has 1 toughness left). But now both Kindles are in graveyard.

Then Alice has no more Kindles to cast. Orim survives.

So, if Bob does not use Orim's ability on the first Kindle, he can use it on the second to save Orim.

Therefore, Bob's optimal response to the first Kindle is to **not use Orim's ability**, because if he uses it on the first, the second Kindle will kill Orim. But if he saves it for the second, he can prevent all damage from the second Kindle and Orim survives.

Now, what if Alice casts both Kindles in quick succession? Actually, she must cast them one at a time (since each is a separate spell).

So, let's formalize:

**Alice's play: She must cast one Kindle at a time.**

Suppose she casts Kindle #1 targeting Orim.
- Bob has priority to respond.
- If Bob activates Orim: tap to prevent 3 damage. Then Kindle #1 resolves, deals 2 damage (prevented). Then Kindle #1 goes to graveyard.
- Then Alice casts Kindle #2: X=3. Bob cannot respond (Orim tapped), so Orim takes 3 damage and dies.

- If Bob does not activate Orim: Kindle #1 resolves, deals 2 damage to Orim (now has 2 damage marked, so 1 toughness left). Then Kindle #1 goes to graveyard.
- Then Alice casts Kindle #2: X=3. Bob can activate Orim (untapped) to prevent 3 damage. So Kindle #2 deals 3 damage (prevented). Orim survives with 2 damage marked.

So, clearly, Bob should not activate Orim in response to the first Kindle. He should wait for the second Kindle.

Therefore, if Alice casts the first Kindle, Bob should not respond. Then after the first Kindle resolves, Orim has 2 damage. Then when Alice casts the second Kindle (which will deal 3 damage), Bob can tap Orim to prevent 3 damage, saving it.

So, in this case, Orim survives.

But can Alice do better? What if she casts both Kindles in a way that Bob cannot respond to both? However, since Bob can always respond to each spell with Orim's ability (as long as Orim is untapped), and Orim is untapped at the start, Bob can always use it once.

Notice that after the first Kindle resolves, Orim is still untapped (unless Bob tapped it, which he shouldn't). So when the second Kindle is cast, Bob can tap Orim to prevent the damage.

Therefore, if Alice simply casts the Kindles one after the other, Bob can always save Orim by using the ability on the second Kindle.

Is there a way for Alice to force Bob to use Orim's ability on the first Kindle? For example, if she casts the first Kindle and holds priority to cast the second? But that doesn't work because she can't cast two instants without passing priority.

MTG rules: When a player casts a spell, they retain priority until they choose to pass it. So, Alice could cast Kindle #1 and, without passing priority, cast Kindle #2. However, this is allowed only if she has the mana and the spells are instants.

Let's try that:

- Alice casts Kindle #1 (targeting Orim). She holds priority.
- Then she casts Kindle #2 (targeting Orim). Now both spells are on the stack.

The stack now has: Kindle #2 (top) and Kindle #1 (bottom).

Now, priority is passed to Bob.

Bob can respond to the top spell (Kindle #2). He can activate Orim's ability: tap Orim to prevent 3 damage. This ability resolves (prevention shield is created).

Then Kindle #2 resolves: it deals X damage. What is X for Kindle #2? At the time it was cast, there were no Kindles in graveyard (since Kindle #1 is still on the stack), so X=2. It deals 2 damage to Orim, but the prevention shield prevents 3 damage, so no damage is dealt.

Then Kindle #1 resolves: it deals X damage. At the time it was cast, there were no Kindles in graveyard, so X=2. But now, after Kindle #2 resolved, is there a Kindle in graveyard? Kindle #2 is in graveyard now. However, when Kindle #1 resolves, we check the number of Kindles in graveyards. At this point, Kindle #2 is in graveyard, so X = 2 + 1 = 3. It deals 3 damage to Orim.

But Orim is already tapped (from Bob's activation), so Bob cannot activate again. So Orim takes 3 damage and dies.

So, by casting both Kindles without passing priority, Alice can force Bob to use Orim's ability on the second Kindle
