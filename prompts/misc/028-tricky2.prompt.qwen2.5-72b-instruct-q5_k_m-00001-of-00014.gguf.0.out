Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10 degrees Celsius, water is already in a frozen state, assuming it has already been cooled below its freezing point. Bob's statement that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius is incorrect because the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius, not -10 degrees Celsius. [end of text]
