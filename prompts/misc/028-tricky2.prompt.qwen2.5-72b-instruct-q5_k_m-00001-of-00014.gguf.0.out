Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

assistant
Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10 degrees Celsius, water is already in a frozen state, assuming it has already been cooled below its freezing point. Bob's statement that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius is incorrect because the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius, not -10 degrees Celsius. [end of text]
