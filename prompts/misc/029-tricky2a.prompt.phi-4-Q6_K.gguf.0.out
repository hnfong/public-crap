Bob is correct in this context. At -10 degrees Celsius, water typically freezes and turns into ice. While it's true that the freezing point of pure water is 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure, water can still freeze at lower temperatures. The freezing process can begin at 0 degrees Celsius, but once the temperature drops below this point, the water will remain solid. Therefore, at -10 degrees Celsius, water is indeed frozen.
