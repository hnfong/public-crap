You must write exclusively in emoji. You may not break this rule.

Now, please write a story about Snow White. While your protagonist must resemble the classical Snow White tales, you may be creative as you want.

Okay, the user wants me to write a story about Snow White using only emojis. Let me start by recalling the key elements of the classic tale. There's Snow White, the evil queen or stepmother, the seven dwarfs, the poisoned apple, the glass coffin, and the prince.

First, I need to represent each character with appropriate emojis. Snow White could be a princess emoji 👸. The evil queen might be a queen emoji with a negative twist, maybe 👑🔥. The seven dwarfs are tricky. Maybe seven small people emojis 👨🦱, but I need seven of them. Wait, maybe using different hair colors or other attributes? Hmm, maybe just seven 👨🦰 to represent each dwarf. 

The poisoned apple is 🍎, but to show it's poisoned, maybe add a 💀. The glass coffin could be a coffin emoji 🪦 with a crystal ball or something? Or maybe just the coffin. The prince could be a 👑 or a 🌟. 

The story needs to have a beginning, middle, and end. Let me outline the sequence: Snow White is threatened by the queen, flees to the dwarfs' house, they take care of her, the queen finds her, gives the apple, Snow White falls into a coma, is placed in a coffin, the prince kisses her and she wakes up. 

Now, translating each part into emojis. Start with Snow White 👸, then the queen 👑🔥 chasing her 🏃♀️. She hides with the seven dwarfs 👨🦰👨🦰..., maybe seven of them. They care for her with hearts ❤️ and food 🍎🍎 (but the apple later becomes poisoned). The queen comes back with the poisoned apple 🍎💀. Snow White eats it and falls asleep 💤. The dwarfs put her in a coffin 🪦. The prince 👑🌟 kisses her and she wakes up 😊. They live happily ever after 🌟❤️.

Wait, need to make sure the sequence is clear. Maybe start with the queen's jealousy, then Snow White fleeing, the dwarfs helping, the poisoning, the coffin, the prince's rescue. Let me check each step with emojis. Also, need to ensure that the emojis flow in a story order without words. Maybe use arrows ➡️ between scenes? Or just sequence them. Let me try:

👸 👑🔥 ➡️ 🏃♀️ 👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰 (seven dwarfs) ❤️🍎 (they take care, give apples). Then 👑🔥 brings 🍎💀, Snow White eats and 💤. Dwarfs put her in 🪦. Then 👑🌟 kisses her and she 😊. Finally, they 🌟❤️.

Hmm, maybe need to make it more concise. Let me count the emojis. Also, maybe use some symbols like 🌲 for the forest, but not sure. Alternatively, use a sequence without arrows. Let me try again:

👸 runs 🏃♀️ from 👑🔥. Hides with seven 👨🦰 (repeated seven times). They care ❤️, give 🍎. But 👑🔥 returns with 🍎💀. Snow White eats 🍎, then 💤. Dwarfs place her in 🪦. Prince 👑🌟 kisses her, she 😊. They live happily 🌟❤️.

Putting it all together with emojis only:

👸🏃♀️👑🔥➡️👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰❤️🍎🍎💀💤🪦👑🌟💋😊🌟❤️

Wait, maybe the arrows aren't necessary. Let me see:

👸🏃♀️👑🔥👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰❤️🍎🍎💀💤🪦👑🌟💋😊🌟❤️

That might work. Let me check each part:

1. Snow White running from the queen: 👸🏃♀️👑🔥
2. Hiding with seven dwarfs: 👨🦰 repeated seven times
3. Dwarfs care and give apples: ❤️🍎 (maybe two apples to show they give her food)
4. The queen brings a poisoned apple: 👑🔥🍎💀 (but maybe the queen is already represented earlier, so maybe just 🍎💀)
5. Snow White eats it and falls asleep: 🍎💤
6. Dwarfs put her in a coffin: 🪦
7. Prince kisses her: 👑🌟💋
8. She wakes up and they live happily: 😊🌟❤️

Hmm, maybe adjust the sequence. Let me try again without the arrows:

👸🏃♀️👑🔥👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰❤️🍎🍎💀💤🪦👑🌟💋😊🌟❤️

Alternatively, maybe the poisoned apple is given by the queen, so after the dwarfs part, the queen comes again with the apple. Maybe:

👸🏃♀️👑🔥➡️👨🦰×7❤️🍎🍎➡️👑🔥🍎💀➡️🍎💤➡️🪦➡️👑🌟💋➡️😊🌟❤️

But since I can't use ×7 or arrows, need to use actual emojis. So seven 👨🦰 in a row. Let me count:

Seven dwarfs: 👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰 (seven times)

Then the queen comes again with the apple: 👑🔥🍎💀

Snow White eats it and sleeps: 🍎💤

Coffin: 🪦

Prince kisses: 👑🌟💋

Happy ending: 😊🌟❤️

Putting it all together:

👸🏃♀️👑🔥👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰❤️🍎🍎👑🔥🍎💀🍎💤🪦👑🌟💋😊🌟❤️

Hmm, maybe the sequence is a bit jumbled. Let me see step by step:

1. Snow White fleeing from the queen: 👸🏃♀️👑🔥
2. Hiding with seven dwarfs: 👨🦰×7
3. Dwarfs care and give apples: ❤️🍎 (maybe two apples to show they provide food)
4. The queen returns with a poisoned apple: 👑🔥🍎💀
5. Snow White eats the apple and falls asleep: 🍎💤
6. Dwarfs put her in a coffin: 🪦
7. Prince kisses her: 👑🌟💋
8. She wakes up and they live happily: 😊🌟❤️

So combining all:

👸🏃♀️👑🔥👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰👨🦰❤️🍎🍎👑🔥🍎💀🍎💤🪦👑🌟💋😊🌟❤️

I think that works. Let me check each part again. The queen is represented by 👑🔥, the dwarfs are seven 👨🦰, the poisoned apple is 🍎 with 💀, the coffin, then the prince with a star and kiss, leading to a happy ending. I think this captures the story in emojis without breaking the rule.
