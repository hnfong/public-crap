Okay, the user wants me to write a story about Snow White using only emojis. Let me start by recalling the key elements of the classic tale. Snow White is known for her pale skin, black hair, red lips, and the seven dwarfs. There's also the evil queen/mother, the poisoned apple, the glass coffin, and the prince's rescue.

First, I need to represent each part with emojis. Let's break it down step by step. The beginning could start with a royal family. Maybe a crown for the queen, a baby for Snow White. Then, as she grows, a young girl emoji. The evil queen might use a mirror (maybe the magic mirror) and a jealous face. 

When Snow White flees, maybe running shoes or a forest emoji. The seven dwarfs can be represented by seven people emojis, maybe with beards or tools. The cottage in the woods could be a house with a tree. 

The poisoned apple is crucial. An apple with a poison symbol? Maybe a skull? Then the glass coffin could be a coffin emoji and a glass. The prince comes to rescue her, so a prince emoji and a heart. Finally, a happy ending with a wedding and a heart eyes emoji.

I need to make sure the sequence flows logically. Let me check each part again. Start with birth, queen's jealousy, Snow White fleeing, meeting dwarfs, the apple, coffin, prince's kiss, and happy ending. Each step needs to be clear with emojis. Maybe add some symbols for key plot points like the mirror, the apple, the coffin. Also, use emojis that convey actions, like running, sleeping, waking up. 

Wait, the user said "exclusively in emoji" so no text at all. I have to make sure there's no letters or numbers. Let me think of each scene as a series of emojis. Maybe start with the queen's mirror, then Snow White running, the dwarfs welcoming her, her eating the apple, the coffin, the prince, and the happy ending. 

Hmm, maybe the order is important. Let me structure it step by step. Also, need to ensure that the emojis are in a sequence that tells the story without words. Maybe use some arrows or sequence indicators? But the user didn't mention arrows, so perhaps just a linear sequence. 

Testing the flow: Crown (queen), baby (Snow White), growing up (young girl), mirror (magic mirror), jealous face, Snow White running (shoe or running emoji), forest (tree), seven dwarfs (seven people), house, apple with poison (🍎 + 💀?), sleeping (zzz), coffin (⚰️) with glass (erglass?), prince (🤴) with heart, waking up (✨ or 🌟), wedding (💍), happy ending (🎉, ❤️). 

Wait, the coffin might be tricky. Maybe coffin and a glass symbol? Or just coffin. The poisoned apple could be an apple with a skull. The prince's kiss could be a prince and a heart. The ending with a wedding and happy emojis. 

I think that's a solid sequence. Let me put it all together in order without any text. Make sure each emoji represents a part of the story. Maybe add some nature elements like a 🌲 for the forest, and a 🏡 for the cottage. The dwarfs could be seven 🧔 emojis. The evil queen's jealousy could be 👑 + 😠. The mirror might be 🪞. 

Putting it all together step by step:

1. Birth: 👑👶
2. Growing up: 👧
3. Queen asks mirror: 🪞👑
4. Mirror says Snow White is fairest: 👧👑
5. Queen's jealousy: 😠
6. Orders the huntsman: 🏃♂️🗡️
7. Snow White flees: 🏃♀️🌲
8. Finds dwarfs' cottage: 🏡🌳
9. Dwarfs welcome her: 🧔🧔🧔🧔🧔🧔🧔
10. Lives happily: 🍎✨
11. Evil queen finds her: 👑👀
12. Poisons apple: 🍎💀
13. Snow White eats it: 🍎😴
14. Falls into deathlike sleep: 💤⚰️
15. Prince finds her: 👑🤴
16. Kisses her: 💋
17. Wakes up: ✨🌟
18. They marry: 💍🎉
19. Live happily ever after: ❤️🎉

Hmm, maybe adjust some parts. The huntsman part might be too detailed, but since the user allows creativity, maybe it's okay. Alternatively, skip the huntsman and go straight to her fleeing. Let me see. Also, the coffin and glass might need to be clearer. Maybe coffin with a glass symbol? But there's no glass emoji. Maybe just coffin and then the prince. 

Alternatively, the sequence could be:

👑👶👧
🪞👑
😠
🏃♀️🌲
🏡🌳
🧔🧔🧔🧔🧔🧔🧔
🍎✨
👀👑
🍎💀
🍎😴
⚰️
🤴❤️
✨
💍🎉
❤️🎉

That's more concise. Each line is a part. But since it's a continuous string, maybe just a sequence without line breaks. Let me string them all together in order. Let me check again for clarity. Maybe add a sleeping beauty emoji? But there isn't one. Use 😴 or 💤. The prince's kiss could be a 💋 between prince and Snow White. 

Final sequence:

👑👶👧🪞👑😠🏃♀️🌲🏡🌳🧔🧔🧔🧔🧔🧔🧔🍎✨👀👑🍎💀🍎😴⚰️🤴💋✨🌟💍🎉❤️🎉

Hmm, maybe that's too long. Let me see if each part is clear. The queen's jealousy, Snow fleeing, dwarfs, apple, sleeping, coffin, prince kisses, wakes up, marries, happy ending. I think that works. Let me make sure there's no text. All emojis. Okay, that should do it.
