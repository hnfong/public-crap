Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Give me your interpretation. You do not have to translate the contents, but you may if you wish.

The lyrics tell the story of a whimsical and slightly surreal experience at a small restaurant in the forest. The setting is fantastical, with elements that don't quite fit together in a literal sense, but work well in a dreamlike or magical context.

The story begins with someone trying to find the restaurant, but they can't reach it even by following acorns. The restaurant is described as small and having no reservations, yet it's lunchtime and all the seats are empty. There's a sense of playfulness, as the lyrics mention a red-painted tin roof and a menu that only offers recommendations.

The atmosphere inside the restaurant is described as lively, with music coming from the kitchen - violin, flute, cello, and viola. The lyrics suggest a welcoming environment, with the restaurant staff inviting guests to eat their fill and then take a nap.

The second verse describes a chaotic scene, with people moving from right to left and even a dancing bear. The menu is filled with various dishes, but notably, there's no dessert. The lyrics end with a promise to deliver the last course to the guests' graves, suggesting a final, memorable experience.

Overall, the story seems to be about a magical, dreamlike restaurant experience that defies logic and reality. It's a place where the usual rules don't apply, and the guests are invited to enjoy a whimsical and unforgettable meal. The lack of dessert and the promise to deliver the last course to the guests' graves add a touch of mystery and intrigue to the story, hinting at a deeper, possibly symbolic meaning. However, the overall tone remains light and playful, with a touch of mischief. 

In a literal sense, the story could be interpreted as a metaphor for a life experience that is both enjoyable and fleeting, with the final course representing the end of life. However, the whimsical and fantastical elements suggest that the story is meant to be taken more as a fun, imaginative journey rather than a deep metaphor. [end of text]
