Snow White was a young girl who lived in a kingdom filled with magic and wonder. She was the eldest of the three daughters, and she was known for her bravery and kindness. One day, she stumbled upon a magical palace that was hidden away in the forest. The palace was enchanted, and it had a secret door that led to a dark and mysterious forest.

As Snow White entered the palace, she was immediately struck by the sight of the dark and foreboding forest. She felt a chill run down her spine as she realized that she was in danger. She quickly hid herself in a hidden room, away from the rest of the kingdom.

As she lay in the dark room, Snow White began to feel a strange and overwhelming sense of dread. She felt like she was being watched, and she couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching her.

One day, a mysterious figure appeared in the room. He was tall and slender, with long, curly brown hair and a bright smile. He introduced himself as the king's daughter, and he asked Snow White to tell him more about the forest and the magic that was hidden there.

As Snow White told him, she revealed that she was the daughter of the king, and that she had been sent to the forest to learn the secrets of magic. The king was impressed by her bravery and kindness, and he asked her to take a special oath: to never reveal the secrets of the forest to anyone, and to always be truthful.

The king's daughter was taken aback by Snow White's words, but he was determined to see that she was safe. He took Snow White to a small cottage, where he hid her in a secret room.

As the night wore on, the king's daughter began to feel a strange and terrifying sense of dread. She began to feel like she was being watched, and she began to feel a strange and overwhelming sense of fear.
