A) No — pure water freezes at 0°C under standard pressure. At -12°C, it is already below freezing, so water would have already frozen.

B) If pure water is cooled to -12°C, it will be frozen solid (ice), since its freezing point is 0°C. Unless it’s supercooled (a metastable state), it will be solid ice at -12°C. [end of text]
