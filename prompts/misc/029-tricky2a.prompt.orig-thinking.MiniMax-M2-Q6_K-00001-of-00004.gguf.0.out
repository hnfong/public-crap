First, the conversation is about water freezing at -10 degrees Celsius. Alice asks what happens to water at -10°C, and Bob says it freezes. Alice corrects him, saying water freezes at 0°C. Bob agrees but says he's still right.

I need to figure out who is right. The key point is the freezing point of water. Under standard conditions, pure water freezes at 0°C. But Bob says water freezes at -10°C, which is incorrect for standard conditions.

However, Bob might be referring to something else. Perhaps he's thinking about supercooled water or other factors. But Alice is stating the standard freezing point.

Bob says, "Yes, but I'm still right." This implies that even though water freezes at 0°C, at -10°C, it is indeed frozen, so he might be technically correct that at -10°C, water is frozen.

Let's think about the temperature. If water is at -10°C, and it's pure water, it should be frozen because it's below the freezing point. So, Bob is right that at -10°C, water is frozen.

Alice is right that the freezing point is 0°C, meaning that at 0°C, water can freeze, but below that, it is solid.

So, both might be correct in their own statements. Alice is correct about the freezing point, and Bob is correct that at -10°C, water is frozen.

But Bob said "water freezes" at -10°C, which might imply that freezing occurs at that temperature, which is not accurate. Freezing occurs at 0°C, but at -10°C, the water is already frozen.

The question is: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" Bob says "It freezes." This could be interpreted as the process of freezing happening at that temperature, which is wrong. Or it could mean that the water is in a frozen state.

In common language, people might say "water freezes" when it turns to ice, but technically, freezing happens at the freezing point.

Alice points out that water freezes at 0°C, which is correct. Bob agrees but says he's still right, meaning that at -10°C, water is indeed frozen.

So, Bob is right that water is frozen at -10°C, but his statement "it freezes" might be misleading.

The question is who is right. I think both are partially right, but Bob's initial statement is imprecise.

Perhaps I should consider the context. The user might be testing logical reasoning.

Let me see the conversation again:

Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"

Bob: "It freezes."

Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."

Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

So, Alice is correcting Bob by stating the freezing point. Bob acknowledges that but insists he is right.

In terms of physics, water at -10°C is solid, so Bob is correct that it is frozen. But the verb "freezes" might imply the action of freezing, which occurs at 0°C.

However, in everyday language, people often say "water freezes" when it gets cold enough, meaning it turns to ice.

But scientifically, freezing is a phase change that occurs at a specific temperature.

I think Bob is technically wrong because freezing doesn't happen at -10°C; it happens at 0°C. At -10°C, the water is already frozen.

But Bob says "it freezes," which might be interpreted as the state of being frozen.

Perhaps Bob is thinking about the fact that water can be supercooled below 0°C without freezing, but that's not standard. Under normal conditions, water freezes at 0°C.

The problem doesn't specify conditions, so we should assume standard conditions.

I recall that in some cases, water can remain liquid below 0°C if it's pure and undisturbed, but that's supercooling, which is not typical.

For most purposes, we say water freezes at 0°C.

So, Alice is correct that water freezes at 0°C.

Bob is incorrect if he means that freezing occurs at -10°C.

But Bob says "I'm still right," which might mean that at -10°C, water is frozen, so his statement is true in that sense.

Let's think about the truth value.

If we ask "what happens to water at -10°C?" the answer is that it is solid, i.e., frozen. So Bob's statement "it freezes" is a bit awkward, but it might be acceptable as shorthand for "it is frozen."

In English, "it freezes" can mean it becomes frozen, which implies the process, but in context, it might be understood as the state.

Alice's correction is accurate.

Bob's persistence might be based on the fact that at -10°C, water is indeed frozen.

So, perhaps both are right, but Bob's wording is poor.

The user asks "Who is right? Explain briefly."

I need to give a concise explanation.

I think Bob is right that water is frozen at -10°C, but his statement "it freezes" is misleading because freezing occurs at 0°C.

Alice is right about the freezing point.

But Bob says "I'm still right," which might be true if we interpret his statement as correct.

Perhaps the point is that Bob is wrong because water doesn't freeze at -10°C; it freezes at 0°C.

Let's see the dialogue: Bob says "It freezes." Alice says "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius." So Alice is saying that Bob is wrong because freezing happens at 0°C, not at -10°C.

Bob agrees that freezing happens at 0°C but says he is still right. This implies that he thinks his statement is correct even though freezing happens at 0°C.

How can that be? If water freezes at 0°C, then at -10°C, it is already frozen, so saying "it freezes" at -10°C is incorrect because the freezing already happened at 0°C.

For example, if I say "water freezes at -10°C," that is false because it freezes at 0°C.

But if I say "at -10°C, water is frozen," that is true.

Bob said "it freezes," which is similar to "water freezes at -10°C," which is false.

So Alice is correct to correct him.

Bob's agreement that water freezes at 0°C shows that he knows the freezing point, but his initial statement is wrong.

Therefore, Alice is right, and Bob is wrong.

But Bob says "I'm still right," which might be a mistake on his part.

Perhaps in the context, Bob means that at -10°C, water is frozen, so his statement is true, but he phrased it poorly.

I think for the purpose of this problem, Alice is correct, and Bob is incorrect.

Let me check online or recall standard knowledge.

Upon second thought, in many contexts, people say "water freezes when it gets cold," meaning when it reaches freezing point, but the temperature at which it freezes is 0°C.

So, at -10°C, it is frozen, but the freezing occurred at 0°C.

Therefore, Bob's statement "it freezes" at -10°C is inaccurate.

Alice is right.

Bob's response "I'm still right" is not valid because his statement is false.

So, I think Alice is right.

But let's see the explanation.

Perhaps the problem is about logical implication.

If water freezes at 0°C, then at temperatures below 0°C, water is frozen. So, at -10°C, water is frozen, so Bob's statement "it freezes" might be interpreted as "it is frozen," which is true.

In English, "it freezes" can be ambiguous. It can mean the action or the state.

In this context, since Alice is asking "what happens," it might be about the state.

But Alice's correction suggests that she interprets "it freezes" as the process happening at that temperature.

I think it's safer to go with Alice being correct.

I recall a similar puzzle where someone says "water freezes at 32°F" and another says "no, it freezes at 0°C," but that's equivalent.

Here, Bob says it freezes at -10°C, which is wrong.

So, I'll go with Alice being right.

Final answer: Alice is right.

Explanation: Water freezes at 0°C, not at -10°C. At -10°C, water is already frozen, but the freezing process occurs at 0°C. Bob's statement that water freezes at -10°C is incorrect.
</think>

Alice is right. Water freezes at 0°C under standard conditions. At -10°C, water is already frozen, but the freezing process occurs at 0°C, not at -10°C. Bob's statement that "it freezes" at -10°C is incorrect because freezing happens at the freezing point, which is 0°C. Bob's agreement that water freezes at 0°C confirms Alice's point, but his insistence that he is still right is flawed because his initial statement misrepresents the freezing process.
