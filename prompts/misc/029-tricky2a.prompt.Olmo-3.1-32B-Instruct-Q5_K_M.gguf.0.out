Let's break down the conversation:

**Alice says:** "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"  
**Bob says:** "It freezes."  
**Alice corrects:** "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."  
**Bob replies:** "Yes, but I'm still right."

Now, let's analyze:

- **Water freezing point:** Pure water freezes at **0 degrees Celsius** under standard atmospheric pressure.
- **At -10°C:** At this temperature, water is **well below its freezing point**. It is already solid (ice), not just in the process of freezing.
- **Bob's statement:** "It freezes."  
  - This is a bit imprecise. At -10°C, water is already frozen; it's not in the process of freezing anymore.
  - However, it is still *true* that the water is in a frozen state at -10°C.
- **Alice's correction:** She is technically correct about the *exact temperature* at which freezing occurs.
- **Bob's defense:** He's saying that at -10°C, water is indeed frozen (ice), so his statement is not entirely wrong.

**Conclusion:**  
- **Alice is correct about the exact freezing point.**
- **Bob is correct in the sense that at -10°C, water is frozen, but his wording ("It freezes") is misleading because freezing is the process that happens at 0°C, not at -10°C.**

So, **both are partially right, but Alice is more precise. Bob's statement is imprecise but not entirely incorrect if interpreted as "it is frozen."** [end of text]
