Sure, here's a list of places in World of Warcraft lore from the original vanilla game, one for each letter of the alphabet:

A - Azeroth (the world itself)
B - Blackrock Mountain
C - Caverns of Time
D - Deadwind Pass
E - Elwynn Forest
F - Feralas
G - Ghostlands
H - Hillsbrad Foothills
I - Ironforge (though it starts with an I, it's technically spelled with a capital I)
J - Jade Forest (though this is from the later expansion, Mists of Pandaria, so perhaps not the best fit. Alternatively, there isn't a significant location starting with J in vanilla WoW)
K - Karazhan (though this is a dungeon, it's a significant location)
L - Loch Modan
M - Moonglade
N - Northern Barrens
O - Orgrimmar
P - Plaguelands
Q - Quel'Thalas
R - Redridge Mountains
S - Stranglethorn Vale
T - Tanaris
U - Undercity
V - Valley of Trials
W - Westfall
X - Xavian (though this is a region within the Hinterlands)
Y - You could argue for Yojamba Isle, but it's a minor location. Alternatively, there isn't a significant location starting with Y in vanilla WoW)
Z - Zul'Gurub (though this is a dungeon, it's a significant location)

For the letters J, Y, and X, it's a bit challenging as there aren't many significant locations in vanilla WoW that start with those letters. I've provided some options, but they may not be as well-known or significant as the others. [end of text]
