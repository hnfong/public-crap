游냥游냥游냥 Once upon a time, in a small village, there were three little pigs who were trying to build their own houses. The first pig was very lazy and didn't want to work hard, so he asked his two friends to build the house for him. The second pig was greedy and wanted to build a house with the best materials, so he went to the market and bought the most expensive wood and bricks. The third pig was smart and wanted to build a house that would be strong and durable, so he used straw and mud.

The first pig's house was built quickly, but it was made of straw and mud, so it was easily destroyed by the wind and rain. The second pig's house was very beautiful and made of expensive wood and bricks, but it was too heavy and fell down when a strong wind blew. The third pig's house was built with straw and mud, but it was strong and durable, so it stood up to all the weather.

One day, a big, mean wolf came to the village and saw the three little pigs' houses. He wanted to eat them, so he tried to knock down the first pig's house, but it was too strong. Then he tried to knock down the second pig's house, but it was too heavy. Finally, he tried to knock down the third pig's house, but it was too strong.

The wolf gave up and went away. The three little pigs were very happy and thanked each other for their help. They knew that they had learned a valuable lesson about hard work, generosity, and intelligence. From that day on, they were always friends and lived happily ever after.
