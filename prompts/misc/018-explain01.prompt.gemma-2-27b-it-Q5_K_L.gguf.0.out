Yo, lemme break it down, the Fed's the boss, see?

They run the money game, the whole economy.

Think of 'em like the DJ, spinnin' the tracks,

Keepin' the beat steady, no lookin' back.

They control the interest rates, the price of dough,

Too high, things slow down, too low, it's a flow.

They print the cash, keepin' it tight,

Too much in the streets, inflation takes flight.

They bail out banks when they're in a bind,

Keepin' the system stable, peace of mind.

So next time you see a dollar bill, remember the Fed,

They're the ones pullin' the strings, keepin' the green spread.

Word up. ðŸŽ¤ðŸ’° [end of text]
