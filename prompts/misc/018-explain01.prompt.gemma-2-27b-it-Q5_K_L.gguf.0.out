Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

Yo, lemme break it down, the Fed's the boss, see?
They run the money game, keepin' the economy breezy.

Think of it like a DJ, spinnin' tracks all day,
Controlin' the flow, makin' sure the money don't stray.

They got the power to raise or lower the rates,
Like turnin' up the bass, or slowin' down the crates.

When times are tough, they drop the rates low,
Gettin' that cash flowin', helpin' the economy grow.

But when things get hot, inflation's on the rise,
They crank up the rates, coolin' down the enterprise.

They printin' money too, keepin' the supply tight,
Makin' sure the dollar stays strong, day and night.

So next time you hear 'bout the Fed, don't be scared,
They just tryin' to keep the economy prepared.

Like a beatmaker, they set the tempo and the flow,
Keepin' the financial world movin' to and fro.
