Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is right because water freezes at different temperatures depending on the pressure it is under. At standard atmospheric pressure, water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius. However, at higher pressures, the freezing point of water is higher. Since -10 degrees Celsius is below the freezing point at standard atmospheric pressure, water would indeed freeze at that temperature if the pressure is high enough.

In this case, it's important to consider the context and specific conditions under which the question is asked. If the pressure is not specified, it's generally assumed to be at standard atmospheric pressure, so Bob's statement would be incorrect. However, if the pressure is known to be high, then Bob's statement would be correct.

In summary, whether Bob is right or wrong depends on the specific conditions and context of the question.
