Assistant: ✊🏾 Yo, listen up, I'm about to drop some facts,
'Bout that Federal Reserve, let me break it down,
It's the bank for the U.S. government, they call it the Fed,
They keep our economy flowin', like a smooth beat.

💲 They control the money supply, it's their main role,
They make decisions that affect us all, that's the truth,
They raise or lower interest rates, it's a big deal,
When they do that, it can make loans cost more or less for yo' peeps.

💸 They also deal with inflation, that's the thief,
When prices start to rise, it's a signal that somethin's off,
The Fed steps in to slow it down, they got the power,
To keep inflation from stealin' our money's worth, yeah, that's for sure.

🏦 They also make sure that banks don't go broke,
They regulate them, make sure they're playin' by the rules,
They work to prevent financial crises, that's the goal,
To keep our economy strong, from wall to wall, that's the tune.

🚨 And in tough times, they take action, no cap,
Like when the economy goes in a tailspin, they got the plan,
To pull us out, they got the tools, they're the masters,
Of the craft, yo, they keep the economy on the right path.

So, next time you hear 'bout the Federal Reserve,
Remember what I said, they're the key to our money's fate,
They're workin' behind the scenes, keepin' the economy straight,
Without 'em, we might be losin' money like we got a debt.

✊🏾 So let's give a shout out to the Federal Reserve,
For all they do, they're the unsung heroes of our money affairs,
Without 'em, we might be strugglin', it's real,
Thanks to the Fed, our economy's steady as she goes, that's the deal.
