Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

Yo, check it, I'm spittin' 'bout the Fed, no cap,

That big bank playa, the U.S. central task,

They control the flow, the money's flowin',

Keep the economy boomin', that's the taskin'.


They set the rates, low, high, or in between,

Inflation watchin', keepin' it clean,

Unemployment rates, they gotta manage,

Keep the streets flowin', give us more money.


Quantitative easin', sounds like a jam,

But it's 'bout buying assets, no qualm,

To pump the cash, keep it circulatin',

And keep our pockets fillin', that's the plan.


So when you're buyin' that new ride or snack,

Know the Fed's workin', keeps the market on track,

They keep it real, keep our wallets swingin',

That's the power, that's the Fed's thingin'.<|end|>
