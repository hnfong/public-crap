Let's analyze the conversation step by step:

1. Alice asks: "What happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius?" 
   - This is a question about the state of water at a temperature below freezing.

2. Bob responds: "It freezes." 
   - This is incorrect because water at -10°C is already frozen (it is ice). Water freezes at 0°C, and below that it remains solid. So, at -10°C, water is not in the process of freezing; it is already frozen.

3. Alice corrects: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius." 
   - This is accurate. The freezing point of water (under standard conditions) is 0°C. At temperatures below 0°C, water is solid (ice).

4. Bob insists: "Yes, but I'm still right." 
   - Bob is wrong. His initial statement "It freezes" implies that the freezing process occurs at -10°C, which is not true. Freezing happens at 0°C when liquid water turns to ice. Below 0°C, water is already solid.

Therefore, Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0°C, and at -10°C it is already frozen (so it doesn't "freeze" at that temperature; it is frozen).

Final answer: Alice is right. Water freezes at 0°C, and at -10°C it is already solid ice. Bob is incorrect because he said "it freezes" at -10°C, which is not accurate. [end of text]
