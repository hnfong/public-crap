 Alright, imagine you're in your school and there's a big group of people who meet to make important decisions for the school. They decide things like what games to play, when to have snack time, and how to keep the playground safe. This big group is like China's National People's Congress.

In China, which is a big country far away from London, this group of people meets to make important decisions for the whole country. They make rules and laws to help people live and work together happily, just like your school rules help you and your friends play nicely together.

So, even though it's very different from your school, the National People's Congress is like a big meeting of important people who help take care of the country. [end of text]
