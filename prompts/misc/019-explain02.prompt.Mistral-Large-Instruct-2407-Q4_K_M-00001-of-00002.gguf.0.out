 Alright, imagine you're in your nursery school in London. You and all your friends get together to make big decisions, like what games to play or what to have for snack time. You choose some people to speak for the whole class, and they talk about what everyone wants and make decisions that are best for all of you.

In China, there's a big group of people called the National People's Congress. They do something similar, but for the whole country! They meet to talk about important things like making new rules, building schools and parks, and helping people. They listen to what the people in China want and need, just like your friends in the nursery do, and try to make good decisions for everyone.

So, the National People's Congress is like a big school meeting, where they talk and make decisions to help the country and the people living there. [end of text]
