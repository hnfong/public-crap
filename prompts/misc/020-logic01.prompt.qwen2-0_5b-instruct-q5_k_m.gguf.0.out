If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

In mathematics, the term "consistent" is often used to describe a theory that is both consistent and tautological. A theory is consistent if it has at least one axiom that is logically valid. A theory is tautological if it is logically equivalent to its own consistency statement.

For example, consider the theory of prime numbers (a subset of the natural numbers). This theory is consistent since every prime number is either 2 or 3, and if we assume the negation of this statement, we would have a contradiction, which is also a tautology.

It is worth noting that the notion of "consistent" and "tautological" can vary depending on the specific context and the definition of a consistent and tautological theory.
