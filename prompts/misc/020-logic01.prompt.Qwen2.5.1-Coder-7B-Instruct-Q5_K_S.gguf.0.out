If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

In logic and mathematics, a theory is considered "consistent" if it does not lead to contradictions. This means that there are no statements within the theory that can be proven both true and false simultaneously. A theory is "tautological" if every statement within it is logically equivalent to a tautology (a statement that is always true).

### Consistency
A theory is consistent if it does not contain any contradictions. For example, Peano Arithmetic is a well-known consistent theory in mathematics. It describes the properties of natural numbers and arithmetic operations, and it has been proven that it does not lead to contradictions.

### Tautology
A theory is tautological if every statement within it is logically equivalent to a tautology. This means that every statement in the theory is always true, regardless of the context. For example, the theory consisting of the single statement "P ∨ ¬P" (where P is any proposition) is tautological because it is always true, as it is a logical tautology.

### Examples
1. **Peano Arithmetic**: This is a consistent theory in mathematics. It describes the properties of natural numbers and arithmetic operations, and it has been proven that it does not lead to contradictions.

2. **Tautological Theory**: A simple example of a tautological theory is the theory consisting of the single statement "P ∨ ¬P". This statement is always true, as it is a logical tautology.

3. **Empty Theory**: An empty theory (a theory with no axioms) is trivially consistent because it does not contain any statements that could lead to contradictions.

In summary, a consistent theory does not lead to contradictions, while a tautological theory consists entirely of statements that are always true. These concepts are fundamental in logic and mathematics, helping to ensure the reliability and validity of theories. [end of text]
