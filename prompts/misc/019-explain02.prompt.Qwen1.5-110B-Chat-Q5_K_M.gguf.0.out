Explain the role of China's National People Congress to a 5 year old child who lives in London.

Alright, imagine China is a really big school, and the National People's Congress is like a big meeting of all the classroom representatives. These representatives are chosen by the children (or people) from each class (or region in China) to make important decisions together for the whole school. They talk about rules, how to make the school better, and they help to decide on what the headmaster (or the government) should do. Just like how in your school, teachers and students work together to make things run smoothly, in China, the National People's Congress helps to make decisions for the whole country.
