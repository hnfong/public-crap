Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Give me your interpretation. You do not have to translate the contents, but you may if you wish.

Based on the lyrics, here's a literal interpretation set in a fantastical forest setting:

In a small forest restaurant, a traveler tries to find their way using acorns (ドングリ) but never arrives. The restaurant is empty during lunchtime, with only birds laughing (パタパタ). The menu is simple, with only recommended dishes, and the kitchen plays a lively melody of classical instruments (バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ).

The restaurant owner welcomes the traveler, inviting them to eat heartily and take a nap afterward. After the meal, the traveler is encouraged to say goodbye and look forward to tomorrow. The scene becomes chaotic as a small dancing bear (手乗りの子熊) joins in the fun. The meal consists of various dishes like carpaccio, paella, and risotto, but no dessert. The final course is served with the intention of reaching even the traveler's grave (お墓の中まで届けましょう).

In this fantastical setting, the story seems to be about a traveler who stumbles upon a magical, lively forest restaurant. The owner welcomes them, serves them a grand meal, and encourages them to enjoy life one day at a time. The dancing bear and the lack of dessert could be interpreted as the restaurant's unique quirks, adding to its charm and whimsy.
