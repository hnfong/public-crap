If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

A consistent theory is one that does not lead to a contradiction, meaning that it is coherent and logically sound. A tautological theory, on the other hand, is one that is true by definition or by the nature of the logical framework itself. 

For example, in classical logic, the axiom "A or not-A" is consistent because it does not lead to a contradiction. However, it is also tautological because it is true by definition, as it is a fundamental principle of classical logic. 

Another example is the Peano axioms, which are a set of axioms for the natural numbers. These axioms are consistent because they do not lead to a contradiction, and they are also tautological because they are true by definition, as they define the natural numbers in a logically sound manner. 

In summary, a consistent theory can also be tautological, but not all consistent theories are tautological.
