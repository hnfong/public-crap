Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is right. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, which is equivalent to 32 degrees Fahrenheit. At -10 degrees Celsius, water is still in a liquid state. The freezing point of water is the temperature at which it changes from a liquid to a solid state. Therefore, Bob's statement is accurate, even though Alice's statement is technically correct.
