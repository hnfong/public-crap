Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Give me your interpretation. You do not have to translate the contents, but you may if you wish.

Based on the lyrics, here's a fantastical story set in a whimsical world:

In a small, hidden restaurant deep within a forest, the narrator follows a path of acorns to arrive at this peculiar place. The restaurant is empty, with no reservations and plenty of vacant seats during lunchtime. Birds chirp and laugh, adding to the playful atmosphere. The restaurant has a bright red tin roof and offers a unique menu with only recommended dishes. Strange and enchanting music played by violins, flutes, cellos, and violas can be heard coming from the kitchen.

The restaurant welcomes its guests, encouraging them to eat to their heart's content and then rest. After bidding farewell to the diners, the restaurant prepares for the next day's adventures.

Suddenly, the scene becomes chaotic as orders fly from right to left, and even a small bear cub starts dancing. The menu now includes exotic dishes like carpaccio, paella, hors d'oeuvres, and risotto, but no dessert. The final line hints at a darker twist: the restaurant offers to deliver its last full-course meal directly to one's grave, implying that those who dine there may never leave.

In this fantastical setting, the lyrics tell the story of a mysterious, enchanted forest restaurant that lures in unsuspecting visitors with its charming atmosphere and peculiar happenings, potentially trapping them there forever.
