Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

Yo, listen up, let me break it down,
'Bout the Fed, the bank that runs the town.
They print the cash, control the flow,
Make sure the economy don't move too slow.

They got two jobs, ain't hard to see,
Keep prices stable, full employment, that's the key.
They raise or lower interest rates, feel me?
To keep the money situation steady.

When times are tough, they step in quick,
Lower rates, make borrowing cash slick.
But when things hot, and prices climb,
They raise rates, make cash hard to find.

They the referee, the money coach,
Keep the economy in the right approach.
So there you have it, plain and clear,
That's the Fed, ain't nothin' to fear.
