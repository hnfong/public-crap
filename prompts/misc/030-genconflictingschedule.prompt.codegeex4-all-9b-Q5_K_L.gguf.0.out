I want you to generate a fictional list of events with their start date/time and end/date time. The columns are:

Event Name,Start Date,Start Time,End Date,End Time

In csv format.
Give me 30 rows. Try to make some of them conflict. Do not have the dates sorted. Just make them random. The dates should be in 2020s.

After you have generated 30 rows, tell me which of the events you generated have conflicted and why.
