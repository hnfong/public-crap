**Bob is right.**

Here is the explanation:
*   **Alice** is correct that the **freezing point** of water is 0°C (the temperature at which liquid water turns to ice).
*   **Bob** is correct that at **-10°C**, water **is frozen**.

Bob's statement "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius" is interpreted as "Water is in a frozen state at -10 degrees celsius." Since water remains solid (frozen) at any temperature below 0°C, his statement is factually true, even though 0°C is the specific threshold where the phase change begins. [end of text]
