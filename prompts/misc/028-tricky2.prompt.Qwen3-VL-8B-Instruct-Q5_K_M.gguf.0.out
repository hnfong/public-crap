Bob is right — **but only if he’s talking about pure water under standard atmospheric pressure**.

Alice is correct that **pure water freezes at 0°C (32°F)** under standard atmospheric pressure. However, Bob’s statement — “Water freezes at -10°C” — is **not universally true**. It’s only true for **water that is already supercooled** or **impure water** (e.g., with dissolved salts or impurities), which can freeze at lower temperatures.

But Bob’s phrase “I’m still right” implies he’s referring to **a specific context** — perhaps water that’s been supercooled or that contains impurities — or he’s making a joke.

In **standard scientific context**, Alice is correct: pure water freezes at 0°C.

So, **if we assume standard conditions**, Alice is right. But Bob’s statement is **technically misleading without context** — and if he’s implying that water *can* freeze at -10°C (which it can, under certain conditions), then he’s also right — **depending on interpretation**.

✅ **Final answer**: **Alice is right under standard conditions. Bob is right in specific contexts (like supercooled or impure water).**

But if Bob is claiming “water freezes at -10°C” as a general rule — he’s wrong.

So, **Alice is correct in the most common scientific context**.

---

**Short version**: Alice is right — pure water freezes at 0°C. Bob’s statement is only true for impure or supercooled water — so he’s not generally right. [end of text]
