First, the user wants me to perform a semantic "grep" on the input. I need to output lines that contain dialog or spoken text, based on the query: "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". I must only output lines that obviously match this, not tangentially related.

The input is provided with line numbers. I need to output the line number and the line itself, but only if it matches the query. After each output line, I should emit "---" to separate it from the next output.

If no lines match, I should give an empty response.

Now, I need to identify what constitutes "dialog or spoken text". Dialog typically means direct speech, often enclosed in quotation marks or indicated by colons or other punctuation. In this input, I see lines with Chinese characters and some punctuation like 「」 and ：, which might indicate speech.

Looking at the input:

- Line 1: "# 呆總嘅老豆" – This seems like a title or description, not dialog.

- Line 2 and 3: Empty lines.

- Line 4: 「轟隆！」 – This is in Chinese quotation marks 「」, and it's an onomatopoeia for thunder. Is this spoken text? It might be a sound effect, but it's presented as if someone is saying it or it's a sound in the narrative. The query says "dialog or spoken text", so I need to see if it's explicitly spoken by a character.

In the context, 「轟隆！」 appears twice (lines 4 and 12). It might be the sound of thunder, but it's in quotes, so it could be considered as someone exclaiming or the narrative describing a sound. However, for dialog, it should be speech from a character.

Let's check other lines:

- Line 8: 「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」 – Here, there's 「啊～！」 and 「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」 both in quotes. This seems like spoken text from the character "老夫".

- Line 27: 「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」 – Clearly dialog, in quotes.

- Line 29: 「你做咤多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。 – This has dialog in quotes and then narrative.

- Line 33: 我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕。 – Here, 「屌」 is in quotes, but it's part of the narrative describing an action. It might be an exclamation, so it could be spoken text.

- Line 39: 「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 – Dialog in quotes.

- Line 41: 「！！！」 – This is in quotes, likely an exclamation or silence, but it's presented as spoken.

- Line 46: 「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」 – Dialog in quotes.

- Line 50: 「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」 – Dialog in quotes.

Also, line 48 has 「？？？」 which is in quotes, indicating a question or confusion.

Now, the query is "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". I need to output the entire line if it contains such text. But some lines have both dialog and narrative. For example, line 29 has dialog and then narrative. Should I output the whole line or just the part with dialog? The instruction says "output the line (together with line number)", so I should output the entire line as it is, if it matches.

But I need to be careful: only trigger when the input obviously matches. So, lines that have clear dialog in quotes or indicated as speech.

Let's list all lines that might contain dialog:

- Line 4: 「轟隆！」 – Is this spoken? It could be a sound effect, but in context, it might be thunder, not necessarily spoken by a character. However, it's in quotes, so it might be considered as an exclamation. But the query says "dialog or spoken text", so if it's not attributed to a speaker, it might not count. In line 4, it's standalone, and later in line 12, it's similar. But in the narrative, it's described as "雷聲", so it's thunder sound. I think for dialog, it should be speech from a character. So, lines like 「轟隆！」 might not be dialog if it's just a sound effect.

Compare to line 8: 「啊～！」 and 「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」 – here, it's clearly the character speaking, as it's followed by "老夫" saying it.

Similarly, line 27, 29, etc., have clear attribution or context.

Line 33: 我「屌」一聲 – this indicates that "我" said "屌", so it's spoken text.

Line 39, 41, 46, 50 all have quotes and are clearly speech.

Line 48: 「？？？」 – this is in quotes and part of the dialog.

Now, what about lines that have narrative but include quoted text? Like line 29: it has dialog in quotes and then narrative. The whole line contains dialog, so I should output it.

But for line 4 and 12, they are just 「轟隆！」 with no speaker indicated. In the context, it's thunder, so probably not spoken text by a character. The query says "dialog or spoken text", implying human speech. Sound effects might not count unless they are presented as speech.

To be strict, I should only include lines where there is explicit speech from a character, indicated by quotes and context.

Let's go through each line:

1: # 呆總嘅老豆 – no dialog, just a title.

2: empty

3: empty

4: 「轟隆！」 – sound effect, not necessarily spoken. Probably not dialog.

5: empty

6: 平靜嘅夜空，竟然響起乾雷。 – narrative, no dialog.

7: empty

8: 「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」 – has two quoted parts: 「啊～！」 and 「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」, and it's clear that "老夫" is speaking. So, this line contains dialog.

9: empty

10: 我望住屋外天色，月光一早被黑雲淹沒，濕氣極重。欽天監今次仲唔掛黑色暴雨警告的話，聽朝睇怕會有十萬人上書皇上，叫佢炒咗嗰班粉腸。 – narrative, no quoted speech.

11: empty

12: 「轟隆！」 呢次雷聲，果然帶來傾盤大雨，屋外屋頂雨聲不絕。 – similar to line 4, quoted sound effect, but followed by narrative. Still, 「轟隆！」 is likely thunder sound, not spoken dialog.

13: empty

14: 我喺呢間屋已經孤獨度過十八個寒暑，屋頂落雨嘅滴嗒聲每一個細節，一早了然於胸。 – narrative.

15: empty

16: empty

17: empty

18: empty

19: 屋頂 ⋯⋯ 多咗一個人。 – narrative.

20: empty

21: 我手握劍柄，六神歸一，留心傾聽。果然有人喺屋頂跳落後庭院！輕盈嘅腳步聲極之細微，來者顯然學過輕功。如果唔係忽然落大雨，敵人嘅突襲可能已經得手。 – narrative.

22: empty

23: 腳步聲越嚟越近，我腰間寶劍出鞘嘅一刻，廳門已經「嘭！」一聲被踢爆。 – has 「嘭！」 in quotes, but it's a sound effect of the door being kicked, not spoken dialog.

24: empty

25: 好在老夫力拔山河氣蓋世，雖然咁樣斬法我把寶劍肯定見財化水，但刀劍相交嘅時候，我感覺到對方力氣似乎比我大大不如。 – narrative.

26: empty

27: 「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」 – clear dialog in quotes.

28: empty

29: 「你做咤多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。 – has dialog in quotes, and then narrative about the voice. So, the line contains dialog.

30: empty

31: empty

32: empty

33: 我提劍急追，佢見我迫近，回身一劍，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕。 – has 「屌」一聲 in quotes, indicating speech. So, dialog.

34: empty

35: 此時大雨已經停止，烏雲漸散。月光之下見到黑衣人喺泥地上不斷掙扎，卻已經無力起身再戰。黑衣人嘅臉相有點似曾相識，我再望返佢把劍，大吃一驚。咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天劍？！ – has "咦！" which might be an exclamation, but it's not in quotes. It's part of the narrative. No quoted speech.

36: empty

37: 呢把劍係當年黨主席賜我嘅禮物，劍身刻有「HARRRR～！！！」嘅洋文，極為霸氣。自從熔癌之役之後，我就冇見過呢把劍，點解會重現人間呢？ – has 「HARRRR～！！！」 in quotes, but this is text on the sword, not spoken dialog. It's describing an inscription. So, probably not spoken text.

38: empty

39: 「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 – clear dialog.

40: empty

41: 「！！！」 – in quotes, likely an exclamation or silent reaction, but it's presented as spoken. In context, it's the黑衣人's response, so it should be dialog.

42: empty

43: 我望住呢個嚟刺殺我嘅黑衣女人，定睛細看，確定咗我心底嘅疑惑之後，緩慢咁講： – narrative, leading to speech.

44: empty

45: empty

46: 「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」 – dialog.

47: empty

48: 「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔，我忽然醒起熔癌唔識英文。 – has dialog in quotes, and then narrative.

49: empty

50: 「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」 – dialog.

51: empty

52: 【完】 – end marker, no dialog.

Now, based on this, lines that contain dialog or spoken text are those with quoted speech from characters. So:

- Line 8: has quoted speech.

- Line 27: quoted speech.

- Line 29: quoted speech.

- Line 33: quoted speech ("屌"一聲).

- Line 39: quoted speech.

- Line 41: quoted speech.

- Line 46: quoted speech.

- Line 48: quoted speech.

- Line 50: quoted speech.

What about line 4 and 12? They have 「轟隆！」 but it's thunder sound, not spoken by a character. Similarly, line 23 has 「嘭！」 which is a sound effect. Line 37 has 「HARRRR～！！！」 which is an inscription, not speech. So, I should exclude those.

Line 35 has "咦！" but not in quotes, so it's narrative exclamation, not quoted dialog.

So, the matching lines are: 8, 27, 29, 33, 39, 41, 46, 48, 50.

I need to output each with the line number and the line, followed by "---".

Also, ensure that I only output if it obviously matches. All these have clear quoted speech.

Now, for the output format: "output the line (together with line number)" – so probably like "8: 「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」"

And after each, emit "---".

If no lines match, empty response, but here we have matches.

Finally, I should not explain, just output as if I'm a command line program.

So, my response should be:

8: 「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」

27: 「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」
---
29: 「你做咤多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。

33: 我提劍急追，佢見我迫近，回身一劍，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕。

---
48: 「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔，我忽然醒起熔癌唔識英文。
---
50: 「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」
---

I need to make sure about line 33: it has "我「屌」一聲", which is quoted, so yes.

Also, line 48 has 「？？？」 and then narrative, but the line contains dialog.

All good.
