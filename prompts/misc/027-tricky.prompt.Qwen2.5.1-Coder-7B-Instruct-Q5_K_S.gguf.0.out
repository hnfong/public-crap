A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. The freezing point of water is a fundamental property of water and does not change with temperature changes below this point.

B) If you have a glass of pure water and you cool it down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will not freeze. Instead, the water will remain in its liquid state. The temperature of the water will simply decrease until it reaches 0 degrees Celsius, at which point it will begin to freeze. Below 0 degrees Celsius, the water will remain liquid until it reaches its freezing point. [end of text]
