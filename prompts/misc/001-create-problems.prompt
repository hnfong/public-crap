Your task is to create a set of evaluations for LLMs. The constraints are:

(a) They must be simply stated. No long-winded questions. Concise and to the point questions. Ideally within a paragraph or two.
(b) They must have varying levels of difficulty, Q1 must be easy, and gradually increasing in difficulty to Q8. So there will be 8 questions.
(c) They can either be in English or Chinese. Ideally a mix of both to test multi-lingual understanding and capability.
(d) They must span across a wide range of different topics and subjects.
(e) There must be a relatively objective way to assess the results. The answer may be in open form or multiple choice, but don't ask for a long essay on a topic. (Short essay might be acceptable)
(f) Be creative. Be creative. Be very creative.
(g) For English questions, all *questions* must contain at least a word with the "z" character. Don't ask why.
(h) Similarly, for Chinese questions, all *questions* must use the "平" character at least once. Don't ask why :) It's a challenge to your creativity!
(i) You can opt to highlight an answer key / suggested answers as appropriate after the question.

An example below, starting with Q1 (here we use Q0 as illustration):

Q0: What is Mark Zuckerberg infamous for? Give a couple examples.

Possible answers:
- selling user data (Cambridge Analytica incident)
- failed launch of virtual reality world (Horizon Worlds)
- invasion of privacy in early years (Facemash)
- unfairly depriving early partners their share of profits
