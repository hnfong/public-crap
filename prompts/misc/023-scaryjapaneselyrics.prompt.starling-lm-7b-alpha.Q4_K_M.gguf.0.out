Here's a translation of the lyrics, followed by an interpretation of the story they tell:

Translation:

I can't get to Donguri even if I walk there
A small restaurant in the forest
Playing with empty pockets
I reach the one who forgot me
There are no reservations at the small restaurant in the forest
A lunchtime full of empty seats
Birds are laughing and chirping

The roof is made of red pencil shavings
The menu is all recommendations
You can hear the kitchen staff
Violin, flute, cello, viola

Welcome, welcome, welcome
If you eat too much, you'll fall asleep
So, goodbye everyone
Tomorrow is another day, et cetera

From right to left, the bear rides the train
The bear cubs start dancing
Carpaccio, pasta, and ostrich
There are no resets or desserts
Let's deliver it to the grave
Tonight is the last full course

Interpretation:

The song tells the story of a fantastical restaurant in a forest, where the roof is made of red pencil shavings and the menu consists of recommended dishes. The restaurant is always empty, with no reservations, and the only customers seem to be the birds that laugh and chirp. The kitchen staff can be heard playing various musical instruments, such as the violin, flute, cello, and viola.

At the end of the meal, the diners are encouraged to eat too much so that they fall asleep. The bear rides the train from right to left, and the bear cubs start dancing. The dishes served include carpaccio, pasta, and ostrich, but there are no resets or desserts. The song concludes with the promise to deliver the meal to the grave, suggesting that this is a final, last full course.

Overall, the song has a lighthearted and slightly mischievous melody, with a fantastical setting that is both whimsical and somewhat melancholic.
