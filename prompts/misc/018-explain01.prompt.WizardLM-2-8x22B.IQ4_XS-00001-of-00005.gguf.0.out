 Yo, check it, uh-huh, listen up, I'll break it down,
The Fed's the maestro, keepin' the economy sound.
It's like the DJ for the U.S. dollar, keepin' the beats,
Makin' sure the cash flow's got no defeat.

They drop the rates when the economy's chill,
Like turnin' up the bass, they give the market a thrill.
When prices jump, they pump the brakes, keep inflation in check,
So your dollar's worth somethin', won't disrespect.

The Fed's the bank of banks, the lender of last resort,
Like when your crew's in a jam, they come to support.
They print the paper, keep the system liquid,
So money's flowin' like a dope classic.

They watch over the 'ville, keepin' an eye on the game,
Interest rates, employment, they're not playin' a fame.
They tweak the levers, keep the economy stable,
Like a DJ with the crossfader, keepin' the party table.

When the market's trippin', they step in, bring the calm,
Like a rapper with a mic, droppin' the wisdom bomb.
They're independent but they serve the public need,
Not chasin' the charts, but the economy's speed.

So when you're countin' your stacks, remember who's behind the scene,
The Fed's the producer, keepin' the green green.
They're the OGs in the financial rap battle,
Keeping the U.S. economy fat and stable.

Peace out, keep it real, let the Fed do its thing,
They're the backbone, man, they make the whole world sing.
In the land of the free, cash rules everything around me,
And the Fed's at the mixer, keepin' the sound fly, C.R.E.A.M. get the money, dollar dollar bill, y'all. [end of text]
