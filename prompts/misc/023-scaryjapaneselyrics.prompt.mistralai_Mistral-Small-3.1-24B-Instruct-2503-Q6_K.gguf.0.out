Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Give me your interpretation. You do not have to translate the contents, but you may if you wish.
The lyrics of this Japanese song paint a whimsical and fantastical scene, likely set in a magical or enchanted forest. Here’s an interpretation of the story the lyrics tell:

### Literal Interpretation in a Fantastical Setting:

1. **The Forest Restaurant**: The song describes a small, mysterious restaurant hidden deep in a forest. The restaurant is so secluded that even following acorns (ドングリ) won't lead you to it. This suggests it is a place that is not easily found by ordinary means.

2. **Empty Reservations and Seats**: The restaurant has no reservations and is filled with empty seats during lunch time. This could imply that it is a place that only certain people can find or that it operates on a different schedule than typical restaurants.

3. **The Menu and Music**: The menu is simple, with only recommended dishes. The kitchen is filled with the sounds of string instruments like the violin, flute, cello, and viola, adding to the enchanting atmosphere. This could mean that the food is prepared with a touch of magic, and the music might be part of the dining experience.

4. **Welcome and Farewell**: The restaurant welcomes guests warmly, encouraging them to eat to their heart's content and then fall asleep. This suggests that the food might have a magical effect, inducing sleep or perhaps transporting guests to another realm.

5. **The Bear and the Dance**: A small bear joins in the festivities, dancing with the guests. This adds to the whimsical and playful nature of the restaurant.

6. **The Meal**: The meal includes dishes like carpaccio, paella, and risotto, but no dessert. The final course is delivered even to the grave, suggesting that the meal is a final, grand experience, perhaps even a farewell feast.

7. **The Final Course**: The "last full course" (最後のフルコース) could imply that this is a once-in-a-lifetime dining experience, possibly a magical journey that ends with a grand finale.

### Possible Themes:

- **Mystery and Enchantment**: The restaurant is a place of mystery and enchantment, where ordinary rules do not apply.
- **Journey and Discovery**: The song could be about a journey of discovery, where the protagonist stumbles upon a magical place that offers a unique and transformative experience.
- **Farewell and Transition**: The final course being delivered to the grave might symbolize a transition or a farewell, suggesting that the meal is a rite of passage or a final celebration before moving on to another realm.
