A) Yes, water freezes at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is 0°C, so any temperature below that will cause water to freeze.

B) If you have a glass of pure water and cool it down to -12°C, the water will freeze and become solid ice. The water will change from a liquid state to a solid state, forming ice crystals. The volume of the water will also increase as it freezes, which can cause the glass to crack or break if the glass is not flexible enough to accommodate the expansion. This is why ice can cause damage to containers or structures when it forms.
