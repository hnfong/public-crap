Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Give me your interpretation. You do not have to translate the contents, but you may if you wish.

The lyrics tell the story of a small restaurant in the forest that is empty and has no reservations. The owner is playing with an empty pocket, waiting for customers to arrive. The restaurant is described as having a red-painted roof and a menu with only recommended dishes. The kitchen can be heard playing various musical instruments.

When customers arrive, they are welcomed and offered a meal that will make them sleepy. The owner then bids farewell to the customers, saying that tomorrow is another day. The customers dance from right to left, and even a stuffed bear joins in. The restaurant does not have any dessert, but the owner promises to deliver the meal to the customers' graves. The song ends with the announcement that this is the last full course meal.

The story is fantastical, but it can be interpreted as a metaphor for the fleeting nature of life and the importance of enjoying the present moment. The empty restaurant and the owner's empty pocket could represent a sense of emptiness or lack of fulfillment in life. The recommended dishes on the menu could symbolize the importance of making the most of what is available. The musical instruments in the kitchen could represent the joy and beauty of life, even in difficult times. The stuffed bear could represent the idea that even inanimate objects can come to life and participate in the joy of life. The lack of dessert and the promise to deliver the meal to the customers' graves could represent the idea that life is short and that we should make the most of it while we can.
