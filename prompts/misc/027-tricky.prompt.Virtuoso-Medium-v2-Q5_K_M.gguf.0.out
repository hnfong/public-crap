A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. At -12 degrees Celsius, water would be in a solid state (ice).

B) If you have a glass of pure water and cool it down to -12 degrees Celsius, the water would freeze and turn into ice. The water molecules would slow down and arrange themselves into a crystalline structure, forming ice. The temperature of the ice would remain at 0 degrees Celsius until all the water has frozen. After that, the temperature of the ice would continue to decrease to -12 degrees Celsius. [end of text]
