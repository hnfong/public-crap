🐷 🏠 🌪️ 🐺

Once upon a time, there were three little pigs. The first pig built a house of straw 🌾, the second pig built a house of sticks 🌲, and the third pig built a house of bricks 🧱. 

One day, a big bad wolf 🐺 came along and huffed and puffed to blow down the first pig's straw house. 🌪️ The house fell down, and the pig ran to the second pig's stick house. The wolf huffed and puffed again, and the stick house also fell. Both pigs ran to the third pig's brick house.

The wolf tried to blow down the brick house, but it was too strong. He couldn't blow it down. The three little pigs were safe inside their strong brick house. They learned that hard work and building a sturdy house pays off. 🎉

The end. 🌟
