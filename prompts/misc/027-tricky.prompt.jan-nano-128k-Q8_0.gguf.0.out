Okay, let's tackle these questions. 

For part A: Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius? I remember that the freezing point of water is 0°C under standard atmospheric pressure. But wait, maybe there's something about supercooling? I think if you have pure water, it can go below 0°C without freezing if there's no nucleation site. But does that mean it actually freezes at -12°C? Or does it freeze at 0°C even if it's cooled to -12°C? Hmm, maybe the answer is that under normal conditions, water doesn't freeze at -12°C because it's below the freezing point, but if it's supercooled, it might freeze at that temperature. But the question is phrased as "does water freeze at -12°C," so I need to clarify if it's under normal conditions or if it's possible under certain circumstances.

For part B: If I have a glass of pure water and cool it to -12°C, what happens? Well, if it's pure water, it might supercool to -12°C without freezing. But if there's any impurity or nucleation site, it would freeze at 0°C. However, if the glass is pure and there's no nucleation, then maybe it would supercool and freeze at -12°C. But wait, in reality, even pure water might not stay supercooled indefinitely because of the presence of tiny bubbles or impurities. So the answer might depend on the presence of nucleation sites. But the question says "pure water," so maybe it's possible to supercool it to -12°C, but once it reaches that temperature, it would freeze if disturbed. But if it's not disturbed, maybe it stays liquid? I need to check if that's accurate.

Wait, the freezing point of water is 0°C, but supercooled water can exist below that temperature if there's no nucleation. So if you have pure water in a clean container, you can cool it to -12°C, but it would freeze when it reaches 0°C. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. If you cool it to -12°C, it's below the freezing point, so it should freeze when it reaches 0°C? No, that's not right. If you cool it to -12°C, it's already below the freezing point, so it would freeze at that temperature if it can nucleate. But if it's supercooled, it might not freeze until it reaches 0°C. Wait, I'm confused. Let me think again.

The freezing point is the temperature at which water turns into ice. If you have pure water and cool it to -12°C, it's below the freezing point, so it should freeze. But in reality, pure water can supercool to below 0°C if there's no nucleation. So if you have a glass of pure water and cool it to -12°C, it might not freeze immediately unless there's a disturbance. But if you just let it sit, maybe it would freeze at -12°C? Or does it require reaching 0°C? I think the key here is that the freezing point is 0°C, but supercooling allows water to stay liquid below that. So if you cool it to -12°C, it would freeze at that temperature if it can nucleate. But if it's supercooled, it might not freeze until it reaches 0°C. Wait, no, that's not correct. If you have pure water and cool it to -12°C, it's below the freezing point, so it should freeze. But in reality, without any nucleation sites, it might not freeze until it reaches 0°C. Wait, that's conflicting. Maybe the answer is that under normal conditions, water doesn't freeze at -12°C because it's below the freezing point, but if it's supercooled, it can freeze at that temperature. But I need to be precise here.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that water freezes at 0°C, but if it's supercooled, it can freeze at lower temperatures. So if you cool pure water to -12°C, it would freeze at that temperature if it can nucleate. But if it's not disturbed, it might not freeze until it reaches 0°C. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If you cool it to -12°C, it's already below the freezing point, so it should freeze. But in reality, supercooled water can exist below 0°C, but only if there's no nucleation. So if you have a glass of pure water and cool it to -12°C, it would freeze at that temperature if it can form ice nuclei. But if it's supercooled, it might not freeze unless something triggers it. So the answer to part B would be that if the water is supercooled to -12°C, it would freeze when it reaches that temperature, but if it's not supercooled, it would freeze at 0°C. Wait, but the question is about cooling it to -12°C. So if you can cool it to -12°C without it freezing, then it would freeze at that temperature if it's disturbed. But if you just let it sit, maybe it doesn't freeze. But the question is about what happens if it's cooled down to -12°C. So the answer is that it would freeze at -12°C if it can nucleate, but if it's supercooled, it might not freeze until it reaches 0°C. But I'm not sure. Maybe the answer is that pure water can be supercooled to -12°C, but it would freeze at that temperature if it's disturbed. However, if it's not disturbed, it might not freeze. But the question is phrased as "what happens if it is cooled down to -12°C?" So the answer is that it would freeze at -12°C if it can form ice nuclei, but if it's supercooled, it might not freeze unless something causes it to nucleate. But I think the correct answer is that water freezes at 0°C, but under certain conditions, like supercooling, it can freeze at lower temperatures. So if you cool pure water to -12°C, it would freeze at that temperature if it can nucleate, but if not, it might not. But the question is about what happens when cooled to -12°C, so the answer is that it would freeze at -12°C if it can form ice, but if it's supercooled, it might not. However, in reality, even pure water might not stay supercooled indefinitely because of impurities or the glass itself. So the answer is that pure water can be cooled to -12°C, but it would freeze at that temperature if it can nucleate. But if it's not disturbed, it might not freeze. But the question is a bit ambiguous. Maybe the answer is that water doesn't freeze at -12°C under normal conditions, but if it's supercooled, it can freeze at that temperature. So for part A, the answer is no, unless supercooled. For part B, if cooled to -12°C, it would freeze if it can nucleate, but if not, it might not. But I need to check the exact freezing point. Wait, the freezing point of water is 0°C, but supercooled water can exist below that. So if you have pure water and cool it to -12°C, it would freeze at that temperature if it can form ice nuclei. But if it's supercooled, it might not freeze unless something causes it to nucleate. So the answer is that water can freeze at -12°C if it's supercooled and has a nucleation site, but under normal conditions, it doesn't. But the question is about what happens if you cool it to -12°C. So the answer is that it would freeze at -12°C if it can form ice, but if not, it might not. However, in reality, even pure water might not stay supercooled for long. So the answer is that pure water can be cooled to -12°C, but it would freeze at that temperature if it can nucleate. But if it's not disturbed, it might not freeze. But the question is phrased as "what happens if it is cooled down to -12°C?" So the answer is that it would freeze at -12°C if it can form ice nuclei, but if it's supercooled, it might not. But I think the correct answer is that water freezes at 0°C, but if you have pure water and cool it to -12°C, it would freeze at that temperature if it's supercooled. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me look up the exact freezing point. The freezing point of water is 0°C, but supercooled water can exist below that. So if you have pure water and cool it to -12°C, it would freeze at that temperature if it can form ice. But if it's supercooled, it might not freeze unless something triggers it. So the answer is that water doesn't freeze at -12°C under normal conditions, but if it's supercooled, it can freeze at that temperature.

But the question is asking what happens when cooled to -12°C. So the answer is that it would freeze at -12°C if it can form ice, but if not, it might not. But I think the correct answer is that water freezes at 0°C, but if you have pure water and cool it to -12°C, it would freeze at that temperature if it's supercooled. Wait, maybe the answer is that water doesn't freeze at -12°C unless it's supercooled. So part A: No, water doesn't freeze at -12°C under normal conditions.

So the answer to A is no, and B is that it would freeze at -12°C if it can form ice nuclei, but if not, it might not. But I need to make sure.

**A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?**  
No, under standard atmospheric pressure, water freezes at 0°C. However, **pure water can supercool to below 0°C** (e.g., -12°C) if there are no nucleation sites (e.g., impurities or disturbances) to initiate freezing. Supercooled water remains liquid until it reaches 0°C or is disturbed, at which point it may freeze. Thus, **water does not freeze at -12°C unless it is supercooled and nucleates**.

**B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?**  
If the glass of pure water is cooled to -12°C without any nucleation sites (e.g., impurities or bubbles), it may **supercool** and remain liquid. However, **if it reaches -12°C and nucleates** (e.g., due to vibrations, impurities, or container imperfections), it will freeze at that temperature. In reality, even pure water might not stay supercooled indefinitely, as the glass itself or environmental factors could trigger freezing. So, **it may freeze at -12°C if nucleation occurs**, but **without nucleation, it remains liquid**. [end of text]
