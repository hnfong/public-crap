Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is right. At -10 degrees Celsius, water does freeze. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius, but this is under standard atmospheric pressure. At higher altitudes or lower pressures, water can freeze at temperatures above 0 degrees Celsius. So, while it's true that water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, Bob's statement is also correct under certain conditions.
