Bob is correct. Water freezes at 0째C under standard atmospheric pressure. However, if the pressure is significantly reduced (e.g., below 0.006 atm), water can freeze at lower temperatures, such as -10째C. In typical conditions, though, Bob's statement is accurate. Alice's claim that water freezes at -10째C is incorrect for standard pressure. 

**Answer:** Bob is right under standard pressure, as water freezes at 0째C. Alice's statement is incorrect for typical conditions. [end of text]
