Imagine China is a big, big playground.  
The National People’s Congress (NPC) is like the biggest group of grown-ups who get together once a year to decide the most important rules for the whole playground.

1. They are the “helpers-in-chief.”  
   They pick the head helper (the President) and the other big helpers (the government leaders).

2. They make the big rule book.  
   They write and say “yes” or “no” to new rules that will help everyone—like how to keep the playground safe, how to share toys, or how to build new slides.

3. They listen to everyone’s ideas.  
   Kids and grown-ups from every corner of China send messages (called “suggestions”) to the NPC. The helpers read those messages and decide which ones to add to the rule book.

4. They check that the rules are followed.  
   Later, they look at what the other helpers are doing and make sure they are playing fair.

So, the NPC is the special meeting where the most important helpers in China come together to make sure the playground is safe, happy, and fair for every single child and grown-up. [end of text]
