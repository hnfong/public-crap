🤍✨ Once upon a time, in a 🌲 forest, there lived a young woman with skin as white as 🧊, hair as black as 🐇 fur, and lips as red as 🍎. She was known simply as Snow White. 🤍

Her stepmother, a queen with a 🧙‍♀️ mirror, was jealous of Snow White's beauty. 🥶 One day, the mirror said, "Snow White is the fairest of all." The queen's heart turned to ❄️ ice. 🥶

The queen disguised herself as an old woman 🧓 and went to Snow White's small cottage. "Would you like a shiny, red 🍎?" she asked. Snow White, kind-hearted, took a bite. 😵‍💫 Suddenly, she felt very sleepy... and fell into a deep, deep sleep. 😴

A 🐇 saw her and called the woodland friends. 🦊, 🦌, and 🦅 gathered around. They couldn't wake her, so they built a glass coffin for her, so she could be seen but not disturbed. ✨

Years passed. A prince 🤴 was traveling through the forest and saw the beautiful woman in the glass coffin. He fell in love at first sight! 💖 With the help of his friends, they lifted the spell from the 🍎 in Snow White's throat. She coughed it out and opened her eyes! ✨

Snow White smiled at the prince. They fell in love and decided to have a wedding. 🤵❤️👰 The prince invited everyone, including the queen. The queen asked her mirror, "Who is the fairest of all?" The mirror replied, "The queen and the princess are beautiful, but the bride is the fairest of all!" 🥳

The queen, furious, tried to sneak into the wedding. But the guests caught her! As punishment, she was forced to wear iron shoes 🔥 and dance until she fell down. 👋 The end. 🏰✨ [end of text]
