If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

If a theory proves itself, it's not necessarily consistent or tautological. Consistency refers to the property of a theory that it doesn't lead to contradictions, while tautology refers to a statement that is always true by definition.

A theory that proves itself is more accurately described as self-consistent, meaning that it doesn't contain any internal contradictions. However, it's still possible for a self-consistent theory to be non-tautological, meaning that it doesn't simply restate a tautology.

Here are some examples of self-consistent theories:

1. Gödel's incompleteness theorems: These theorems show that any formal system powerful enough to describe basic arithmetic is either incomplete or inconsistent. This means that if a theory is consistent, it cannot prove its own consistency. However, Gödel's theorems also show that there are statements that cannot be proved or disproved within the system, which is a form of self-consistency.
2. The liar paradox: This is a classic example of a self-consistent paradox. The liar paradox states "this sentence is false." If the sentence is true, then it must be false, but if it's false, then it must be true. This creates an infinite loop of contradictions, but it's still a self-consistent paradox.
3. Russell's theory of types: Bertrand Russell's theory of types is a self-consistent theory that avoids the paradoxes of naive set theory. It introduces a hierarchy of types, where sets are only allowed to contain sets of lower types, and not sets of the same or higher types. This creates a self-consistent framework for dealing with sets.
4. Gödel's incompleteness theorems: As mentioned earlier, Gödel's incompleteness theorems show that any formal system powerful enough to describe basic arithmetic is either incomplete or inconsistent. However, Gödel's theorems also show that there are statements that cannot be proved or disproved within the system, which is a form of self-consistency.

In summary, while a theory that proves itself is self-consistent, it's not necessarily tautological. Self-consistency refers to the property of a theory that it doesn't lead to contradictions, while tautology refers to a statement that is always true by definition. [end of text]
