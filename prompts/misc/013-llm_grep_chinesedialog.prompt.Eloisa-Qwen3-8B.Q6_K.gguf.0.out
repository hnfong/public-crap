Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a semantic grep tool, filtering lines from the input that contain dialog or spoken text. The key points are to only output lines that obviously match the query, not tangentially related, and to include the line number with each output. Also, after each line, I need to add a "---" separator.

First, I need to understand what constitutes "dialog or spoken text." In the context of the input, this would be lines where characters are speaking, either directly quoted or through internal monologue. For example, lines with quotation marks or direct addresses like "啊～！" or "你係咪熔癌嘅人？！" are clear examples.

Now, looking at the input, I'll go through each line one by one. Lines 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52.

Starting with line 4: "「轟隆！」" – This is a sound effect, not dialogue. So skip.

Line 8: "「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」" – This has direct dialogue with quotes, so include.

Line 27: "「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」" – Dialogue in quotes, include.

Line 29: "「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。" – Dialogue in quotes, include.

Line 31: (empty) – Skip.

Line 34: "「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 我抑壓心抵嘅震驚，若無其事咁問。" – Dialogue in quotes, include.

Line 41: "「！！！」 黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我。" – Dialogue in quotes, include.

Line 43: "「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」" – Dialogue in quotes, include.

Line 46: "「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔，我忽然醒起熔癌唔識英文。" – Dialogue in quotes, include.

Line 49: "「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」" – Dialogue in quotes, include.

Line 52: 【完】 – This is the end marker, not dialogue, so skip.

Now, check for any other lines that might have spoken text without quotes. For example, line 28: "「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」" is already included. Line 30: (empty). Line 32: (empty). Line 35: (no dialogue). Line 36: (no dialogue). Line 37: (no dialogue). Line 38: (no dialogue). Line 39: (no dialogue). Line 40: (no dialogue). Line 42: (no dialogue). Line 44: (no dialogue). Line 45: (empty). Line 47: (no dialogue). Line 48: (no dialogue). Line 50: (no dialogue). Line 51: (no dialogue).

So the lines that contain dialog or spoken text are 8, 27, 29, 34, 41, 43, 46, 49. Each of these lines should be output with their line numbers and followed by "---".
