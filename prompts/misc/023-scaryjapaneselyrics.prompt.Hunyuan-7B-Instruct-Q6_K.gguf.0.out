The lyrics describe a whimsical and fantastical journey through a magical forest, filled with playful and surreal imagery. Here's an interpretation of the story:

---

The protagonist is on a quest to find someone they've forgotten, despite the melody being lighthearted and mischievous. They visit a small, magical restaurant in the forest, which seems to defy logic by having no reservations and being filled to capacity. The restaurant is run by a quirky, mischievous character (possibly a fox or a similar animal) who serves a bizarre and nonsensical menu, including "バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ" (bioline fullt chero biola), which might be a playful or invented dish. The protagonist eats something strange and ends up feeling sleepy, as the lyrics suggest.

The journey continues with a series of magical encounters, including dancing with a bear on a hand-carrying platform and visiting a quirky café called "カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル" (calpacho paearia odbl), which serves only a "リゾット" (restitution) and no dessert. The protagonist feels like they're on a mission to deliver something to an "お墓" (grave), suggesting a fantastical task or quest.

The tone of the song is lighthearted and adventurous, with a sense of wonder and exploration. The lyrics could be interpreted as a playful narrative about a magical adventure, where the protagonist is embarking on a journey to fulfill a personal or fantastical goal, all while enjoying the whimsy and surrealness of the forest.
