The National People Congress, also known as the National People's Congress, is the highest governing body of China. It is composed of 39 national congressmen elected by the people of China every two years. The role of the National People Congress is to represent the will and opinions of the people in China's governance. It makes decisions on behalf of the people, including economic policy, defense policy, foreign policy, and other matters. It also sets laws and regulations that are binding on all Chinese citizens. In simple terms, the National People Congress is like a legislature in a democracy, making decisions that affect the country's future.
     Imagine you're a 5-year-old living in London. The National People Congress is like the government of China. It's the group of people who decide how the country should run, like deciding on laws and policies. Just like how you have your own government in your country, China has a National People Congress. They make decisions that affect everything from how the country should spend its money to how it should protect itself. It's like a democracy in action, but for a country with a population of 1.4 billion people.
     So, to summarize, the National People Congress is like the brain of China, making decisions that shape the country's future.
