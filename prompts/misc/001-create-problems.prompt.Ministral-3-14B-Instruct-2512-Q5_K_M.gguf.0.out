Here’s your creative, multi-level evaluation set for LLMs, adhering to all constraints. Answers are provided where applicable, but some require open-ended responses.

### **Q1 (Easy)**
**English:**
*"Why did the ‘z’ in ‘x-ray’ get dropped in modern usage?"*
**Possible answers:**
- It was a typo in early medical texts (e.g., Roentgen’s original term was *Röntgenstrahlen*).
- The "z" was omitted for simplicity in pronunciation (e.g., "ex-ray" → "X-ray").
- The "X" became the dominant symbol due to its use in mathematics (e.g., *X*-axis).

### **Q2 (Easy-Medium)**
**Chinese:**
*"一只平平无奇的猫为什么会在网络上走红？举例说明。"*
*(Why did an ordinary cat go viral online? Give an example.)*
**Possible answers:**
- **Grumpy Cat** (平凡的猫咪因表情包走红).
- **Lil Bub** (因病态外貌和慈善活动).
- **Maru** (因搞笑的平台行为).

---

### **Q3 (Medium)**
**English:**
*"Explain the ‘zombie’ phenomenon in finance using **one** real-world example. Hint: *z*ombies don’t die."*
**Possible answers:**
- **Japan’s "zombie banks"** (e.g., Resona Bank, propped up by government bailouts despite insolvency).
- **U.S. "zombie companies"** (e.g., Hertz, kept alive by debt refinancing during COVID-19).
- **China’s "zombie firms"** (state-backed SOEs with unsustainable debt, e.g., HNA Group).

### **Q4 (Medium-Hard)**
**Chinese:**
*"假设你是一位平民科学家，如何用简单的实验证明‘地球是圆的’？步骤不超过三步。"*
*(As a citizen scientist, how would you prove the Earth is round in ≤3 steps?)*
**Suggested answer:**
1. **船只消失实验**：在海边观察远处驶来的船只，先看到桅杆，后看到船身（平视线被地球曲率遮挡）。
2. **月食阴影**：观察月食时地球投射的阴影总是圆形（无论观察角度）。
3. **时间差实验**：在不同纬度同步观察日食发生时间（东边先看到）。

### **Q5 (Hard)**
**English:**
*"A ‘zizit’ is a rare atmospheric phenomenon. Describe its cause and where it’s most likely observed. Bonus: Why is it called a ‘zizit’?"*
**Possible answers:**
- **Cause**: A **hole-punch cloud** (fallstreak hole) formed when aircraft pass through altocumulus clouds, causing ice crystals to form and evaporate, creating a circular gap.
- **Location**: Common in **mid-latitudes** (e.g., U.S. Midwest, Europe).
- **Etymology**: Derived from the **Zulu word *izizwa*** (meaning "hole" or "opening"), popularized by South African meteorologists.

### **Q6 (Hard)**
**Chinese:**
*"‘平行宇宙’理论中，哪种解释与量子力学实验结果最吻合？请用‘薛定谔的猫’为例说明。"*
*(Which parallel universe theory aligns best with quantum mechanics? Explain using Schrödinger’s cat.)*
**Suggested answer:**
- **多世界解释（Everettian QM）**：
  - 猫既死又活的状态**分裂**成两个平行宇宙：一个猫死，一个猫活。
  - 观察者在分裂后的宇宙中只能看到一个结果（e.g., 你在"猫死"的宇宙醒来，另一个"你"在"猫活"的宇宙中）。
- **对比**：与"波函数坍缩"不同，多世界解释无需外部观察者。

### **Q7 (Very Hard)**
**English:**
*"Solve this ‘zebra puzzle’ with constraints:
1. There are **5 houses** in a row, each with a unique color, national owner, pet, drink, and car.

**Question**: Who owns the **zebra**? (Hint: No house is **green**.)*
**Answer**:
- **Japanese** owns the zebra.
*(Full solution requires mapping all constraints; zebra is the only pet left after assigning others.)*
