**Q – Quietglade Lake**  
A hidden, tranquil lake in Ashenvale, home to the peaceful furbolg tribes and untouched by the corruption of Felwood.

**R – Redridge Mountains**  
A rugged range in the Eastern Kingdoms, rich in minerals and home to the Stormwind and Stormpike dwarves, as well as the dragonflight led by Onyxia.

The rebuilt human capital of the Kingdom of Stormwind, ruled by King Varian Wrynn, a symbol of human resilience after the fall of Lordaeron.

**X – Xoroth**  
The shadowy demon realm referenced in the Book of Medivh, where the Burning Legion originates and where Sargeras resides.

**Y – Yogg-Saron (Ulduar)**  
Though Ulduar is from later expansions, in vanilla lore, the Old God Yogg-Saron is referenced as a distant, slumbering terror beneath the earth, though his direct location isn't explored. *For the sake of the alphabet, we can consider the general concept of the Old Gods' influence.*

**Z – Zul’Farrak**  
The ancient desert city of the sand trolls in Tanaris, filled with puzzles, mummies, and the spirit of the Prophet Skeram.

> **Note:** Some letters (like X and Y) are creatively stretched using vanilla lore references. Xorath is from the Book of Medivh, and Yogg-Saron is referenced as a looming threat, though not directly visited in-game. Zul’Farrak is a key vanilla instance and lore site.

Let me know if you'd like a version that includes **neutral or faction-specific locations** or **more obscure references**! [end of text]
