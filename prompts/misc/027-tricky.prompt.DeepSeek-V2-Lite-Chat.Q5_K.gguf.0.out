User: Answer the following questions with brief explanations.

A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?
B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?


Assistant: 1. A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). At -12 degrees Celsius, water would be in the supercooled state, meaning it is below its freezing point but has not yet formed ice crystals.

2. B) If a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will remain in the supercooled state. At this temperature, water molecules will continue to move slowly, but they will not have enough kinetic energy to form ice crystals. If the water is then subjected to a foreign particle or surface, it may freeze around that object, or it may remain supercooled until it is cooled further or exposed to warmer temperatures.
