Alice is right.

Water freezes at **0°C** under standard atmospheric pressure. At **-10°C**, liquid water *will* freeze (assuming it’s pure water and nucleation occurs), but the freezing *point*—the temperature at which liquid and solid coexist in equilibrium—is **0°C**, not -10°C.

Bob’s statement “It freezes” is vague and misleading in this context. While water *can* be frozen at -10°C, the *freezing point* is defined as 0°C. So saying “water freezes at -10°C” is incorrect as a general statement—it implies that’s the freezing point, which it isn’t.

Alice correctly identifies the freezing point. Bob is not right in claiming he’s still right without clarification. [end of text]
