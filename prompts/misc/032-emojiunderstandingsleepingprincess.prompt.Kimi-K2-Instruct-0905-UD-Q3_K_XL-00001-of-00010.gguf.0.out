It’s the story of Snow White, told in emoji:

1. Princess lives in castle with her family; jealous queen.  
2. Magic mirror names a fairer princess.  
3. Evil queen poisons Snow White with apple; she “dies.”  
4. Dwarfs and forest creatures guard her sleeping body.  
5. Prince wakes/kisses her; wedding and happy ending.

Same tale Disney popularized in the 1937 film “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.” [end of text]
