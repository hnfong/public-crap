Okay, let's break this down. The user asks two related questions about water freezing at -12°C. First, I need to confirm the freezing point of pure water. Standard knowledge says pure water freezes at 0°C under normal conditions, so -12°C is below that. But the second question introduces nuance: a glass of pure water cooled to -12°C. 

Hmm, here's where supercooling comes in. Pure water can remain liquid below 0°C if undisturbed, but -12°C is quite low—likely beyond the typical supercooling limit. I recall pure water can supercool to about -40°C in theory, but in practice, impurities or nucleation sites usually trigger freezing around 0°C. However, in a clean glass, it might supercool a bit, but -12°C is pushing it. 

Wait, the user might be testing if I understand the difference between theoretical and practical freezing. Also, they mention "glass of pure water"—glass surfaces could provide nucleation sites. So maybe it freezes at 0°C, but if perfectly pure and smooth, it might supercool slightly. But -12°C is so cold that even supercooled water would likely freeze spontaneously or upon disturbance. 

I should clarify: pure water freezes at 0°C, but supercooling can occur. At -12°C, it's almost certain to freeze, either spontaneously or with a trigger. So answer A is no, water doesn't typically freeze at -12°C—it freezes at 0°C. For B, the water would freeze, possibly after supercooling briefly. Keep it brief but precise.

**A)** No, pure water does not typically freeze at -12°C under normal conditions. The standard freezing point of pure water at atmospheric pressure is **0°C**.

**B)** If a glass of pure water is cooled to -12°C, it will **freeze into ice**. However, pure water can sometimes remain liquid below 0°C in a supercooled state if it is very pure and undisturbed. At -12°C, supercooling is unlikely—the water will almost certainly freeze, either spontaneously or upon the slightest disturbance (like touching the glass). [end of text]
