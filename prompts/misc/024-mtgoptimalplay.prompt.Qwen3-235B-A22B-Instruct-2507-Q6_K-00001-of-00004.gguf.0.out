Let's analyze this **Magic: The Gathering** scenario carefully, using current **MTG rules (as of 2024)**, including **timing, the stack, damage prevention, and state-based actions**.

---

### **Game State Summary**

- **Alice**:
  - Turn: It is **Alice's turn** (assume it's her **main phase**, after any summoning sickness restrictions are irrelevant).
  - Hand: **Two copies of *Kindle***.
  - Mana: **Sufficient to cast both** (assume ≥ 2R total).
  - Graveyard: Initially **0 copies of *Kindle***.
  - Battlefield: No relevant permanents mentioned.

- **Bob**:
  - Hand: **Empty**.
  - Battlefield: **Orim, Samite Healer** (1/3 creature, untapped).
    - **Ability**: {T}: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.
  - Lands: **Tapped out** → cannot generate mana this turn.
  - Graveyard: Assume no *Kindle*s (unless specified).

---

### **Objective**

Alice wants to **kill Orim** using her two *Kindle*s.  
Bob wants to **save Orim** using his tap ability.

---

## Step-by-Step Analysis

We need to determine the **optimal play** for both players, considering **timing, the stack, and damage prevention**.

---

### 🔹 Understanding *Kindle*

> **Kindle**  
> Instant — *Deal X damage to any target, where X = 2 + the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards.*

So, the **value of X depends on how many *Kindle*s are in graveyards when the spell resolves**.

This is **key**: the **damage is not locked in when cast**, but **determined as the spell resolves**.

---

### 🔹 Understanding Orim’s Ability

> **Orim, Samite Healer**  
> {T}: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.

- This is a **mana ability**? No — it requires tapping, but **tapping is part of the cost**, so it **goes on the stack**.
- It **targets** (implied by "to any target").
- It creates a **replacement effect**: the next 3 damage that would be dealt to the chosen target this turn are prevented.
- It can only be used **once per turn**, unless Orim untaps (but it's already untapped, and Bob has no way to untap it again this turn).
- Once used, it **cannot prevent more than 3 damage**.

---

## 🔎 Alice’s Options

Alice wants to **deal enough damage to Orim to kill it** (i.e., **deal 4 or more net damage**, since Orim has 3 toughness).

She has two *Kindle*s.

Let’s consider **sequencing**.

---

### 🚫 Option 1: Cast both *Kindle*s at once (without interaction)

Suppose Alice casts both *Kindle*s targeting Orim, one after the other.

But Bob can **respond** to the **first** *Kindle* by activating Orim’s ability.

Let’s walk through the **optimal line**.

---

## ✅ Optimal Play Sequence

### **Turn: Alice’s Main Phase**

#### **1. Alice casts the first *Kindle* targeting Orim.**

- *Kindle* goes on the stack.
- At this point, **0 *Kindle*s in graveyards** → but **X is not yet determined**.
- Stack: [*Kindle* (X = ?) targeting Orim]

#### **2. Bob responds by activating Orim’s ability.**

- Bob taps Orim: {T}: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.
- He targets **Orim**.
- This ability goes on the stack **on top** of the *Kindle*.

> **Stack now:**
> - Top: Orim’s ability (prevent next 3 damage to Orim)
> - Bottom: *Kindle* (resolving next)

#### **3. Orim’s ability resolves.**

- Creates a **damage prevention shield**: the next 3 damage that would be dealt to Orim this turn are prevented.
- Orim is now tapped.

#### **4. *Kindle* resolves.**

- Now, we check: **How many *Kindle*s are in graveyards?**
  - **Zero** — the first *Kindle* hasn’t resolved yet, so it’s still on the stack.
  - So X = 2 + 0 = **2**.
- *Kindle* deals **2 damage** to Orim.
- But **Orim has a prevention effect active**.
- The **first 2 of the next 3 damage** are prevented.
- So **2 damage is prevented**, Orim takes **0 damage**.
- Orim is now at **0 damage marked**, still 1/3.

> 🔁 Prevention effect is now **used up** (only prevents "the next 3 damage" — this was 2 damage, so 1 "prevention" remains? No.

Wait — important rule:

> **Replacement effects like damage prevention apply to the entire event.**  
> If 2 damage is dealt, and a prevention effect says "prevent the next 3 damage", then **the entire 2 damage is prevented**, and the effect is **exhausted**.

> From CR 615.6: "If an effect attempts to do something to an amount of damage, and that amount is prevented, the effect does nothing to that damage."

> And CR 615.7: "Some prevention effects also include instruction for a player to do something 'instead' of the damage being dealt... the prevention effect replaces the damage event entirely."

So: **The 2 damage is prevented**, Orim takes **0**, and the **prevention shield is now gone** (it only prevents the *next* instance of damage, up to 3).

✅ **Orim’s ability has now been used and is gone.**

---

#### **5. Alice casts the second *Kindle*, targeting Orim.**

- Now, **one *Kindle* is in the graveyard** (the first one resolved and went to graveyard).
- So X = 2 + 1 = **3**.
- *Kindle* deals **3 damage** to Orim.

- Is there any prevention? **No** — Orim’s ability was already used.
- So Orim takes **3 damage**.

- Orim has **3 toughness**, so **3 damage marked = destroyed**.

> State-based actions (SBAs) are checked after the spell resolves.
> Orim has damage equal to toughness → **is destroyed and sent to graveyard**.

✅ **Orim dies.**

---

## 🔄 Could Bob Do Better?

Let’s ask: **Is there a better play for Bob?**

Bob’s only option is **when to activate Orim’s ability**.

He has **two choices**:

1. **Respond to the first *Kindle*** → as above.
2. **Wait and respond to the second *Kindle***.

Let’s test **Option 2**.

---

### ❌ Bob’s Alternative: Wait, activate on second *Kindle*

#### Alice casts first *Kindle* → Bob **does nothing**.

- *Kindle* resolves.
- At resolution: **0 *Kindle*s in graveyard** → X = 2.
- Deals **2 damage** to Orim.
- Orim now has **2 damage marked**.

#### Alice casts second *Kindle*.

- Now, **1 *Kindle* in graveyard** → X = 2 + 1 = **3**.
- Targets Orim.
- Bob now activates Orim’s ability (taps Orim) in response.

- Stack:
  - Orim’s ability (on top)
  - *Kindle* (3 damage)

#### Orim’s ability resolves → prevents **next 3 damage** to Orim.

#### *Kindle* resolves → tries to deal 3 damage → **entirely prevented**.

- Orim now has **2 damage marked**, survives.

✅ **Orim survives!**

So in this line, **Bob saves Orim**.

---

## 🎯 Conclusion: Optimal Play

Now we see:

- If Bob **prevents the second *Kindle***, Orim **survives**.
- If Bob **prevents the first *Kindle***, Orim **dies**.

So **Bob should wait** and **use his ability on the second *Kindle***.

But can he?

Yes — because **players receive priority after each spell resolves**.

So Bob can **choose** when to activate Orim’s ability.

---

### ✅ Optimal Play:

#### **Alice’s best play:**
She **cannot force Orim to die** if Bob plays optimally.

But can she do better?

Wait — what if she **casts both *Kindle*s before Bob can activate Orim**?

No — **Bob gets priority after the first *Kindle* is cast**, and can **choose not to act**, waiting for the bigger threat.

But here’s a key insight:

> Alice can **only cast one spell at a time**. After she casts the first *Kindle*, **Bob gets priority** and can either:
> - Activate Orim now, or
> - Pass, letting *Kindle* resolve, then respond to the second.

So Alice **cannot "surprise"** Bob with both.

But here’s a twist: **Can Alice cast the second *Kindle* in response to the first resolving?**

No — once the first *Kindle* resolves, **priority returns to Alice**, who can then cast the second.

But Bob can **wait**.

So the **optimal line for Bob** is:

> **Let the first *Kindle* resolve (2 damage), then use Orim’s ability to prevent the second *Kindle* (3 damage).**

Result: Orim takes **2 damage**, survives.

---

### But wait — can Alice change the order?

No — both *Kindle*s are identical.

But here’s a **critical realization**:

> The **second *Kindle* deals more damage** because the first is in the graveyard.

So the **second one is the bigger threat**.

Therefore, **Bob should save his prevention for the bigger spell**.

---

## ✅ Final Answer: Optimal Play

### **Alice’s Play:**
- Casts first *Kindle* targeting Orim (deals 2 damage).
- Then casts second *Kindle* targeting Orim (would deal 3 damage).

She **cannot kill Orim** if Bob plays optimally.

### **Bob’s Optimal Response:**
- **Do nothing** in response to the first *Kindle*.
- Let it resolve → Orim takes 2 damage.
- When Alice casts the second *Kindle* (3 damage), **activate Orim’s ability in response**, targeting Orim.
- The 3 damage is **prevented entirely**.
- Orim has only 2 damage marked → **survives**.

---

## 🏁 Outcome

> **Orim, Samite Healer survives.**

Alice dealt a total of **2 damage**, prevented **3**, but Bob’s timing ensured the **larger instance of damage was prevented**.

---

## 🔚 Key Rules & Concepts

1. **Damage prevention** (CR 615): Prevents damage before it’s dealt; "the next 3 damage" means the next damage event up to 3.
2. **Replacement effects**: Preventing damage replaces the event; once used, the effect is gone.
3. **Spell resolution**: *Kindle*’s damage is determined **as it resolves**, based on graveyard count **at that time**.
4. **Priority**: After a spell is cast or resolves, players get priority to respond.
5. **Stack order**: Last ability/spell cast resolves last (LIFO).
6. **State-based actions**: Checked after spells resolve; creature with damage ≥ toughness is destroyed.

---

## 🧠 Thought Process Summary

- **Alice**: Wants to maximize damage. But her spells are **increasing in power**, so the **second is more dangerous**.
- **Bob**: Has one prevention shield. Should use it on the **larger damage source** to maximize survival chance.
- Therefore, **Bob should wait** and **counter the bigger threat**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

> The **optimal play** is:
> - Alice casts the first *Kindle*, dealing 2 damage to Orim.
> - Bob **does not respond**, allowing it to resolve.
> - Alice casts the second *Kindle*, which would deal 3 damage.
> - Bob **activates Orim’s ability in response**, preventing the 3 damage.
>
> **Result**: Orim takes only 2 damage and **survives**.
>
> Therefore, **Bob can save Orim with correct timing**, and this is the **optimal play for both players**. [end of text]
