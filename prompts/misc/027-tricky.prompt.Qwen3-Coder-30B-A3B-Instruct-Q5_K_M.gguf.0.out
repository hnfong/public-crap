A) **No, water does not freeze at -12°C.** Water freezes at 0°C (32°F) under standard atmospheric pressure. At -12°C, water would be in a supercooled liquid state or would have already frozen if it was pure water.

B) **If you cool pure water to -12°C, it will freeze.** Pure water has a freezing point of 0°C, so when cooled to -12°C, the water molecules will arrange themselves into a crystalline structure, forming ice. The water will undergo a phase change from liquid to solid at this temperature. However, in some cases with very clean water and no nucleation sites, it might remain liquid temporarily (supercooling), but it will eventually freeze when disturbed or when ice crystals form spontaneously.
