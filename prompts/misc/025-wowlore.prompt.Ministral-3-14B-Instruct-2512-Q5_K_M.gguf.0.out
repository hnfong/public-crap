Here’s a list of places in *World of Warcraft* lore (original vanilla, no expansions) for every letter of the alphabet, starting with "A for Azeroth":

- **A for Azeroth** – The world itself, the vast continent where the game takes place.
- **B for Blackrock Depths** – The infamous dwarven stronghold beneath Blackrock Mountain, home to the Blackrock clan.
- **C for Coilfang Reservoir** – A massive, serpentine lake in Stranglethorn Vale, filled with deadly waters and the remnants of the Serpent Lord Deathwing’s influence.
- **D for Deadmines** – The cursed dwarven mine in Elwynn Forest, overrun by the Scarlet Crusade and later the Defias Brotherhood.
- **E for Elwynn Forest** – The human homeland in the Eastern Kingdoms, where the story of the Alliance begins.
- **F for Felwood** – A dark, corrupted forest in the western part of the Eastern Kingdoms, once a haven for druids and now a battleground against the Burning Legion.
- **G for Ghostlands** – A haunted, undead-infested region in Lordaeron, once a noble human kingdom now ruled by the Scarlet Crusade and the Forsaken.
- **H for Hillsbrad Foothills** – A scenic region in Lordaeron, home to the human city of Southshore and the ruins of the human capital, Lordaeron.
- **I for Icecrown** – The frozen citadel in Northrend (though not in vanilla, the name is tied to lore—alternatively, **Icecrown Glacier** in the far north of Northrend, though not accessible in vanilla, so **Icecrown Citadel** is lore-only; for vanilla, **Icecrown** itself is a concept, so perhaps **Icecrown Glacier** is too far—**alternative: Icecrown** is lore, but in vanilla, **Icecrown** isn’t a place, so **Icecrown Glacier** is out—**replacement: I for Icecrown (lore concept)** or **I for Icecrown Glacier (lore, not vanilla)**—since vanilla doesn’t have it, maybe **I for Icecrown (lore)** or **I for Icecrown Glacier (lore)**—but since vanilla doesn’t have it, perhaps **I for Icecrown (lore)** is acceptable, or **I for Icecrown Glacier (lore)**—but since it’s not in vanilla, maybe **I for Icecrown (lore)** is the best fit.
