In this scenario, Alice's goal is to kill Bob's Orim, Samite Healer, which is a significant threat to her burn deck. Let's break down the optimal plays for both Alice and Bob, considering the game mechanics and the specific abilities of the cards involved.

### Alice's Optimal Play

1. **Assess the Situation:**
   - Alice has two copies of Kindle in her hand.
   - Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards.
   - Bob has Orim, Samite Healer in play, which can prevent the next 3 damage to any target this turn.

2. **Calculate the Damage:**
   - If Alice casts one Kindle, it will deal 2 + 0 = 2 damage (since there are no Kindles in the graveyards yet).
   - If Alice casts the second Kindle, it will deal 2 + 1 = 3 damage (since one Kindle is now in the graveyard).

3. **Plan the Sequence:**
   - Alice should cast the first Kindle targeting Orim. This will deal 2 damage.
   - Bob can respond by tapping Orim to prevent the next 3 damage. However, since the first Kindle only deals 2 damage, Orim will still have 1 point of prevention left.
   - Alice should then cast the second Kindle targeting Orim. This will deal 3 damage. Since Orim has 1 point of prevention left, it will prevent 1 damage, but the remaining 2 damage will still be dealt to Orim.

4. **Outcome:**
   - Orim starts with 3 toughness.
   - The first Kindle deals 2 damage, reducing Orim's toughness to 1.
   - The second Kindle deals 3 damage, but 1 damage is prevented, so 2 damage is dealt, reducing Orim's toughness to 0.
   - Orim is destroyed and goes to the graveyard.

### Bob's Optimal Play

1. **Assess the Situation:**
   - Bob knows that Alice has two copies of Kindle and can deal a total of 5 damage if both are cast.
   - Bob's Orim can prevent 3 damage, but not all 5 damage.

2. **Plan the Response:**
   - Bob should tap Orim to prevent the first 3 damage.
   - However, this will not be enough to save Orim, as Alice can still deal 2 more damage with the second Kindle.

3. **Outcome:**
   - Bob's best play is to tap Orim to prevent the first 3 damage, but this will not be sufficient to save Orim from the second Kindle.

### Conclusion

- **Alice's Optimal Play:**
  - Cast the first Kindle targeting Orim.
  - Cast the second Kindle targeting Orim.
  - This sequence will ensure that Orim is destroyed.

- **Bob's Optimal Play:**
  - Tap Orim to prevent the first 3 damage.
  - This will not be enough to save Orim, but it is the best response given the situation.

- **Final Outcome:**
  - Orim is destroyed and goes to the graveyard.
  - Alice successfully removes a significant threat to her burn deck. [end of text]
