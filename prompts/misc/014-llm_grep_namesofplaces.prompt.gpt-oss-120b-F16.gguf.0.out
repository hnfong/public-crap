<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to parse input lines, find country or region names. Output line number and the country/region name(s) found, like grep -n -o (line number:match). If multiple matches on same line, output each? Usually grep -n -o prints each match on separate line with same line number. We'll follow that.

We need to output only lines that have country/region names. Provide line number and the name. Then "---" separator after each output line.

Let's scan input lines:

1: "Let's Talk about Unfair Trade Restrictions" - no country.

2: "In today's world, it's hard to understand why countries impose extra restrictions on importing goods from nations they consider "unbalanced" in trade. This outdated practice hampers fair commerce and leads to smuggling." - no specific country names.

4: "Take Britain, for example. They allow Silesia lawns to be imported for personal consumption, but prohibit French cambrics and lawns, even if they're meant for export. The UK also imposes higher duties on French wine, while being lenient towards Portugal. This uneven treatment is not only unfair but also stifles trade."

Countries/regions: Britain, French (France), UK (United Kingdom), Portugal. Also Silesia (region). So we need to output each.

Line numbers: 4.

We need to output each match with line number. Eg "4:Britain". Then "---". Similarly for each.

But note "French" is adjective; but still refers to France. Should we output "France"? The text says "French cambrics". The country name is "France". The adjective "French" may be considered a reference. The query: "names of countries or regions". So "French" is not a name, but "France" is. However the text does not contain "France". It contains "French". Might not count. But "Britain" is a country name. "UK" is abbreviation. "Portugal" is a country. "Silesia" is a region.

Thus matches: Britain, UK, Portugal, Silesia.

Line 6: "Another issue is that there's no reliable way to determine which country has the "balance of trade" in their favor..." No specific names.

Line 10: no.

Line 12: no.

Line 15: no.

Line 16: "Imagine if England's merchants often pay for goods from Hamburg, Dantzic, and Riga using bills from Holland. This would affect the debt and credit balance between England and Holland, even if England's exports to Holland exceed its imports."

Countries/regions: England, Hamburg (city/region), Dantzic (historical name for Danzig, now Gda≈Ñsk, region), Riga (city), Holland (region/country). So matches: England, Hamburg, Dantzic, Riga, Holland.

Line 17: "The way we calculate exchange rates can also be misleading. It's like saying that a country's currency is worth a certain amount based on its mint's standard, but this standard might not reflect the actual value of the currency. For example, before a coin reform in England, the value of the English currency was actually lower than its standard value. This means that the real exchange rate might be different from the calculated one."

Matches: England, English (adjective). We'll include England.

Line 18: blank.

Line 19: "Another issue is that the cost of coinage is different in each country. In England, the government covers the cost, but in France, individuals pay a duty of 8% for coinage. This makes French coins more valuable than English coins with the same amount of silver. So, even if the coins are near their standard values, a sum of English money couldn't buy an equal amount of French money."

Matches: England, France, French (adjective). We'll include England, France.

Also earlier line 4 includes "Britain" and "UK". Should we treat "UK" as a country name? Yes.

Now produce output lines.

We need format: "line_number:match". Eg "4:Britain". Then "---". For each match.

If multiple matches on same line, each on separate output line with same line number.

Let's list matches in order of appearance.

Line 4: "Britain" appears first. Then "French" (skip). Then "UK". Then "Portugal". Then "Silesia". Actually Silesia appears earlier: "They allow Silesia lawns". So order: Britain, Silesia, UK, Portugal. We'll output in that order.

Thus output lines:

4:Britain
---
4:Silesia
---
4:UK
---
4:Portugal
---

Line 16: matches order: England, Hamburg, Dantzic, Riga, Holland, England again? Actually "England's merchants" then "goods from Hamburg, Dantzic, and Riga". Then "bills from Holland". Then later "between England and Holland". So we have England (first), Hamburg, Dantzic, Riga, Holland, England (second), Holland (second). Should we output duplicates? Grep -o would output each match occurrence. So duplicates appear. We'll output each occurrence.

Thus line 16 outputs:

16:England
---
16:Hamburg
---
16:Dantzic
---
16:Riga
---
16:Holland
---
16:England
---
16:Holland
---

Line 17: "England". Appear maybe once. So:

17:England
---

Line 19: "England", "France". Appear multiple times: "In England", "but in France", "French coins", "English coins". So matches: England, France, English? "English" is adjective; not a country name. We'll include England and France each occurrence.

Occurrences order: England (first), France (second), English (skip), English (skip). So two matches.

Thus:

19:England
---
19:France
---

Check earlier lines for any other country names: line 2 no. line 6 no. line 10 no. line 12 no. line 15 no.

Now produce final output with each line separated by "---". Ensure after last line also "---"? The instruction: after each line of output, also emit a "---". So yes after each.

Let's compile final answer.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>4:Britain
