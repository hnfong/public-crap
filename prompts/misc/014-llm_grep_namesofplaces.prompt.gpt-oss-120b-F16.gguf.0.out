<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to output lines with country/region names only, with line numbers, like grep -n -o. So we need to extract each country name occurrence per line? The query: "names of countries or regions. only output the country/region names with line number". So for each line that contains a country name, output line number and the country name(s). Possibly multiple per line; maybe each occurrence separate? Usually grep -n -o prints each match on separate line with line number. So we should output each match with line number. Provide "---" after each output line.

We need to identify country/region names in the text.

Let's scan lines:

Line 2: "countries" generic not a name. No specific.

Line 4: "Britain", "Silesia", "French", "France", "Portugal". Also "UK". "Germany". Need to decide which are country/region names. "Britain" (UK), "Silesia" is a region (historical region). "French" is adjective not name. "France" is country. "Portugal" country. "UK" abbreviation for United Kingdom (country). "Germany" country.

Line 6: "Britain", "France", "Portugal", "Germany". Also "Britain". So same.

Line 8: none.

Line 10: none.

Line 12: none.

Line 15: none.

Line 16: "England", "Hamburg", "Dantzic", "Riga", "Holland". Also "England". "Hamburg" city but region? Might be considered region. "Dantzic" (Danzig) region. "Riga" city. "Holland" region/country (Netherlands). We'll include.

Line 17: "England". Also maybe "England". That's it.

Line 18: none.

Line 19: "England", "France". Also "English" not.

Thus we need to output each match with line number.

We need to decide format: "line_number:match". Eg "4:Britain". Provide each on separate line.

Add "---" after each line.

Let's list matches in order of appearance scanning line by line.

Line 4: "Britain", "Silesia", "France", "Portugal", "UK", "Germany". Also "French" not included. "British"? Not.

But "UK" is abbreviation; include.

Thus produce lines:

4:Britain
4:Silesia
4:France
4:Portugal
4:UK
4:Germany

Line 6: "Britain", "France", "Portugal", "Germany". Also maybe "Britain". So:

6:Britain
6:France
6:Portugal
6:Germany

Line 16: "England", "Hamburg", "Dantzic", "Riga", "Holland". Also "England" again later? Already.

Thus:

16:England
16:Hamburg
16:Dantzic
16:Riga
16:Holland

Line 17: "England". So:

17:England

Line 19: "England", "France". So:

19:England
19:France

Check line numbers: line 4,6,16,17,19.

Now produce output with "---" after each line.
