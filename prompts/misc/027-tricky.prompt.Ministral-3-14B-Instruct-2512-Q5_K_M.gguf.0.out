A) **Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?**
   - **Yes**, water typically freezes at **0°C (32°F)** under standard atmospheric pressure. However, it *can* remain **supercooled** (liquid below 0°C) down to **-40°C (-40°F)** or lower in ideal conditions (e.g., pure water, no impurities, slow cooling). Below **-40°C**, supercooling becomes unstable, and freezing usually occurs.

B) **What happens if a glass of pure water is cooled to -12°C?**
   - **Most likely, it will freeze**—but not immediately. Pure water can **supercool** to **-12°C** if cooled slowly and free of nucleation sites (e.g., dust, scratches). However, once disturbed (e.g., a tap, vibration), it will **rapidly crystallize into ice**, releasing heat and potentially shattering the glass due to expansion.
   - If impurities (e.g., dust) are present, freezing would likely start at **0°C** and progress normally. [end of text]
