Both Alice and Bob are correct, but they are referring to different stages or conditions of water.

1. **Alice's first statement**: "What happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius?"  
   - She is asking about the state of water *at* -10°C.  

2. **Bob's reply**: "It freezes."  
   - This is correct because at -10°C, water (if it were liquid) would freeze. However, liquid water cannot stably exist at -10°C under normal conditions; it would already be ice.  

3. **Alice's correction**: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius."  
   - This is also correct because the *freezing point* of water (the temperature at which it transitions from liquid to solid) is 0°C under standard conditions.  

4. **Bob's final statement**: "Yes, but I'm still right."  
   - He is correct because at -10°C, water *is* frozen (it is ice).  

### Summary:
- Alice is right that water *begins* freezing at 0°C.  
- Bob is right that at -10°C, water *is* frozen (ice).  

They are talking about different aspects of the same phenomenon. Alice is referring to the phase transition point, while Bob is describing the state at a temperature below that point. [end of text]
