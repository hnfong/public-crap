 USER: Answer the following questions with brief explanations.

A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?
B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?

ASSISTANT:  A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. Water has a specific freezing point of 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit), which is the temperature at which it transitions from liquid to solid ice. The freezing point can be slightly lowered by the presence of impurities or dissolved substances, a phenomenon known as freezing point depression, but pure water will not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius.

B) If you have a glass of pure water and cool it down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will remain in the liquid state. As mentioned earlier, pure water does not freeze at this temperature. However, if the water is not pure and contains impurities, it may freeze at a lower temperature, depending on the concentration and type of the solutes. This is because the presence of solutes depresses the freezing point of the solvent (in this case, water). If the temperature is below the pure water freezing point but above the freezing point of the water with impurities, the pure water will not freeze but can supercool to a point where it can spontaneously freeze upon a slight disturbance, like a seed crystal or a draft.
