The images you've shared appear to be a collection of emoji and character images, likely from a social media or messaging platform. They depict a mix of characters and emotions, including a family, a bride and groom, and various animals. 

While these images don't directly remind me of any specific popular culture references, they do evoke a sense of a lively, colorful, and sometimes whimsical social media feed. The variety of characters and emotions could be reminiscent of popular animated series or meme culture that often features diverse characters and a range of emotions. For example, the mix of characters could be similar to the diverse cast of characters in shows like "BoJack Horseman" or "Rick and Morty," or the wide range of emotions could be reminiscent of meme culture that often uses emojis to express a variety of feelings.
