Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (°C), not at -10°C. The freezing point of water is a fundamental physical property of the substance, regardless of the temperature. 

To understand why, let's consider the phase diagram of water, which shows the conditions under which water can exist as liquid, solid, or gas. The phase diagram typically includes a line or curve that represents the freezing point of water, which is 0°C (°C) at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere or 101.3 kPa). 

At temperatures below this freezing point, water can exist as a liquid, but it will not freeze. This is because the kinetic energy of the water molecules is insufficient to overcome the intermolecular forces that hold them together in liquid form. 

When the temperature drops below the freezing point, the water molecules begin to slow down and lose energy, which causes them to form a solid structure. This process is known as freezing. 

Therefore, Bob's statement that water freezes at 0°C is correct, and Alice's incorrect statement that water freezes at -10°C is incorrect. [end of text]
