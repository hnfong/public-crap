Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Alice is right. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit), not -10 degrees Celsius. Bob is mistaken. 

While water *can* start to freeze below 0°C, it doesn't fully freeze at -10°C. [end of text]
