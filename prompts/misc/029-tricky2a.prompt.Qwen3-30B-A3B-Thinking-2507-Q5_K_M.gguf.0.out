Okay, the user presents a dialogue between Alice and Bob about water freezing at -10°C. Let me unpack this carefully.

First, Alice correctly states water freezes at 0°C under standard conditions. Bob says "it freezes" at -10°C, which is technically true but misleading. The key here is understanding phase change temperatures versus actual freezing points. 

Hmm, the confusion seems to be about whether -10°C is the freezing point or just a temperature where water would be frozen. Bob's statement is factually correct in that water at -10°C is indeed frozen, but his phrasing implies -10°C is the freezing point, which is wrong. Alice catches that nuance.

I recall that freezing point is defined as the specific temperature where liquid turns to solid at standard pressure. So 0°C is the freezing point, while -10°C is a temperature below that point where water exists as ice. Bob's "I'm still right" is a classic case of technically correct but contextually wrong - like saying "the sun is up at midnight" when it's actually below the horizon.

The user probably wants to test understanding of scientific terminology versus casual language. This is a common misconception in everyday speech where people say "water freezes at 10 degrees" meaning "it's frozen when it's 10 degrees below zero." But scientifically, we must distinguish between the transition point and temperatures below it.

Also noting this is a simple physics question, so the explanation should stay concise as requested. No need to dive into supercooling or pressure effects - that would overcomplicate it for this level. Just clarify the definition of freezing point versus state at a given temperature.

*checks standard definitions* Yep, IUPAC defines freezing point as the temperature at which liquid and solid coexist in equilibrium at 1 atm. So at exactly 0°C it's transitioning, below 0°C it's solid. Bob's error is in implying -10°C is the transition temperature.

The user seems to be testing attention to precise language - maybe a teacher preparing a quiz? Or a student confused by similar dialogues. The "explain briefly" suggests they want the core concept without jargon. 

Final verdict: Alice is scientifically correct about the freezing point, Bob is technically correct about the state at -10°C but wrong about the freezing point. So Alice wins the accuracy contest here.

Alice is scientifically correct. Water **freezes at 0°C** under standard atmospheric pressure (this is its *freezing point*). At **-10°C**, water is *already frozen* (solid ice), but it does **not** freeze *at* -10°C—it froze *at* 0°C and remains frozen below that temperature.  

Bob is technically correct that water is frozen at -10°C, but he misstates the *freezing point* (0°C), making his claim misleading. Alice correctly identifies the freezing point, so **Alice is right**.  

**Brief summary**:  
- Freezing point = **0°C** (where liquid turns to solid).  
- At **-10°C**, water is *already frozen* (solid), but it didn’t freeze *at* -10°C.  
→ Bob confused the *state* (frozen) with the *temperature of freezing*. [end of text]
