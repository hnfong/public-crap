A classic debate!

Both Alice and Bob are correct, but their statements apply to different conditions:

* Alice is right that pure water freezes at 0°C (32°F) under standard atmospheric pressure. This is the normal freezing point of water.
* Bob is also correct in the context of supercooling. If water is cooled very slowly and carefully to below 0°C without any disturbances or nucleation sites (e.g., tiny particles or bubbles), it can remain in a liquid state below its freezing point, a phenomenon called supercooling. However, at around -10°C, supercooled water will rapidly freeze in a process called flash freezing or instantaneous freezing.

So, in summary:
- Under normal conditions, water freezes at 0°C (Alice is right).
- Under specific conditions of supercooling, water can remain liquid below 0°C, but will rapidly freeze at around -10°C (Bob is also right in this context). [end of text]
