The command you provided is a pipeline of several Linux commands that process the text file "wowfanfic.txt" in a specific way. Let's break down the command and explain what it does:

1. `cat wowfanfic.txt`: This command reads the contents of the file "wowfanfic.txt" and outputs it to the standard output (stdout).

2. `perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'`: This Perl one-liner processes each line of the input. It splits each line into words using whitespace as the delimiter and then prints each word on a new line.

3. `sort`: This command sorts the words in alphabetical order.

4. `uniq -c`: This command counts the occurrences of each unique word and outputs the count along with the word.

5. `sort -n`: This command sorts the output numerically based on the word counts.

6. `tail -n 20`: This command selects the last 20 lines of the output, which correspond to the 20 most frequent words in the text.

Given this pipeline, the probable output would be a list of the 20 most frequent words in your fan fiction, along with their respective counts. The words would be sorted in ascending order of frequency.

From a linguistic perspective, this output provides insights into the vocabulary and word usage patterns in your fan fiction. Here are some basic linguistic principles that can be observed:

1. **Frequency Distribution**: The output reflects the frequency distribution of words in your text. Common words like articles, prepositions, and conjunctions (e.g., "the", "and", "of") are likely to appear at the top of the list due to their high frequency in most texts.

2. **Lexical Density**: The number and variety of unique words in your fan fiction can be inferred from the output. A higher number of unique words suggests a richer vocabulary and potentially more complex writing style.

3. **Content Words vs. Function Words**: Content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) typically carry more meaning and are often more specific to the context of your fan fiction. Function words (articles, prepositions, conjunctions) are more frequent but less informative about the specific content.

4. **Character Names and Game Terminology**: Since your fan fiction is based on World of Warcraft characters, you might see frequent occurrences of character names, game-specific terms, and locations. These words would stand out in the list, especially if they are unique to the World of Warcraft universe.

5. **Narrative Style**: The frequency of certain words can also reflect your narrative style. For example, frequent use of action verbs might indicate a fast-paced, action-oriented story, while more adjectives and adverbs might suggest a descriptive, detailed narrative.

In summary, the output of this command provides a quantitative analysis of the most frequent words in your fan fiction, offering insights into its vocabulary, content, and style from a linguistic perspective. [end of text]
