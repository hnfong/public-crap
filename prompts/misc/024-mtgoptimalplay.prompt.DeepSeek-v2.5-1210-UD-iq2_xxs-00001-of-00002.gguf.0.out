In this scenario, Alice and Bob are engaged in a game of Magic: The Gathering, and Alice is looking to eliminate Bob's Orim, Samite Healer, which is a significant threat to her burn deck. Let's break down the situation and analyze the optimal plays for both players, considering the game mechanics as of 2024.

### The Setup:
- **Alice's Hand:** Two copies of 'Kindle'.
- **Bob's Board:** Orim, Samite Healer (1/3), untapped.
- **Mana Availability:** Alice has sufficient mana to cast any spells; Bob's lands are tapped out.
- **Turn:** It is Alice's turn.

### The Mechanics Involved:
1. **Kindle:** An instant that deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards.
2. **Orim, Samite Healer:** A legendary creature with the ability "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."

### Alice's Thought Process:
Alice wants to kill Orim as quickly as possible. Since she has two copies of Kindle in her hand, she needs to consider how to maximize the damage dealt to Orim.

1. **First Kindle:**
   - Alice casts the first Kindle targeting Orim.
   - The damage dealt by the first Kindle is calculated as X = 2 + 0 (since there are no Kindle cards in any graveyards yet) = 2 damage.
   - Orim takes 2 damage, reducing its toughness from 3 to 1.

2. **Second Kindle:**
   - Alice casts the second Kindle targeting Orim.
   - The damage dealt by the second Kindle is calculated as X = 2 + 1 (since there is now one Kindle card in the graveyard) = 3 damage.
   - Orim would take 3 damage, reducing its toughness from 1 to -2, which would cause Orim to die.

However, Bob has the ability to prevent damage with Orim. Let's consider Bob's optimal play.

### Bob's Thought Process:
Bob wants to maximize the effectiveness of Orim's ability to prevent damage. Since Orim can prevent up to 3 damage in a single use of its ability, Bob needs to decide when to use it.

1. **First Kindle:**
   - Bob sees Alice casting the first Kindle.
   - Bob decides to use Orim's ability to prevent the next 3 damage.
   - Orim taps and prevents the 2 damage from the first Kindle.
   - Orim remains at 3 toughness.

2. **Second Kindle:**
   - Alice casts the second Kindle targeting Orim.
   - The damage dealt by the second Kindle is 3 damage.
   - Since Orim has already used its ability to prevent 3 damage, it cannot prevent any more damage this turn.
   - Orim takes 3 damage, reducing its toughness from 3 to 0, causing Orim to die.

### Outcome:
- **Alice's Play:** Casts the first Kindle, then the second Kindle.
- **Bob's Play:** Uses Orim's ability to prevent the damage from the first Kindle.
- **Result:** Orim dies from the damage dealt by the second Kindle.

### Conclusion:
Alice's optimal play is to cast both Kindle spells in sequence, targeting Orim. Bob's optimal play is to use Orim's ability to prevent the damage from the first Kindle, but this does not prevent the damage from the second Kindle. As a result, Orim is killed, and Alice achieves her goal of eliminating the threat to her burn deck. [end of text]
