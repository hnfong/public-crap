Aight, check the mic—one two, the Fed’s in the house,  
Not a gangsta crew, but they runnin’ the cash flow.  

Yo, the **Federal Reserve**—we call it *the Fed*—  
Is like the **banker’s bank**, the ultimate head honcho, yeah.  
They ain’t printin’ money in their basement like a mixtape,  
But they *control* the supply—keep the dollar from collapse.  

Think of the economy like a track—  
Too much liquidity? Man, that track’s *slippin’*—inflation’s crackin’.  
Prices jump, your flexin’ don’t go far—  
That’s the Fed’s cue to *step in* and put the brakes on, *y’all*.  

How they do it? Simple—  
They tweak the **interest rate**—that’s the *cost to borrow*.  
Raise it? Nah, keep it tight—make loans expensive, slow the storm.  
Lower it? Boom—cheaper credit, folks buy new kicks,  
Businesses expand, jobs pop off—*that’s* how they spark.  

They also got **reserve requirements**—  
Banks gotta hold cash, like a safety net, no cap.  
If a bank’s in trouble? The Fed’s the *lender of last resort*—  
Drop a lifeline, keep the whole system *burstin’*—not *burstin’* like a riot,  
But *burstin’* like a hit track—*blowin’ up*!  

They watch the streets—*the markets*—  
Buy or sell Treasuries to pump or drain the cash.  
It’s all about balance—like a DJ mixing tracks,  
Too much bass? *Boom*, inflation. Too thin? *Boom*, recession.  

So yeah—the Fed’s the silent OG,  
Keepin’ the game stable, though they never drop a track.  
They ain’t in the video, but they *got the whole beat*,  
Without ‘em? The whole economy—*flatline*, no heartbeat.  

🎤 *Mic drop.*  
*The Fed don’t rap—but they runnin’ the whole game.* [end of text]
