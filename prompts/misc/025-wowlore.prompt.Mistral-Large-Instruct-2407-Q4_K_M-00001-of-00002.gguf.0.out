 Sure, here's a list of places in World of Warcraft lore for each letter of the alphabet, based on the original vanilla WoW:

A - Azeroth
B - Booty Bay
C - Caer Darrow
D - Darnassus
E - Eastern Plaguelands
F - Feralas
G - Gnomeregan
H - Hillsbrad Foothills
I - Ironforge
J - Jaguero Isle
K - Kalimdor
L - Loch Modan
M - Moonglade
N - Northshire Valley
O - Orgrimmar
P - Plaguewood
Q - Quel'Thalas
R - Redridge Mountains
S - Stormwind City
T - Tanaris
U - Undercity
V - The Veiled Sea
W - Westfall
X - (There isn't a place starting with X in vanilla WoW)
Y - (There isn't a place starting with Y in vanilla WoW)
Z - Zul'Gurub

For the letters X and Y, which don't have corresponding places in vanilla WoW, you could consider other aspects of the game or lore, such as character names or items, but for the sake of this list, I've focused on places. [end of text]
