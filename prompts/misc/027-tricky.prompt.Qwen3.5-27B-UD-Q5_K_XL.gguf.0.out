**A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?**
**Yes.** Pure water freezes at 0°C (32°F) under standard atmospheric pressure. Since -12°C is significantly below this freezing point, water will be in a solid state (ice) at this temperature.

**B) What happens if a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?**
The water will **freeze into ice**. As the temperature drops below 0°C, the water molecules lose kinetic energy and form a crystalline lattice structure, turning the liquid into a solid.
*Note: In very specific, controlled conditions (supercooling), pure water can remain liquid briefly below 0°C, but it will almost instantly freeze into ice once disturbed or if a nucleation site is introduced at -12°C.* [end of text]
