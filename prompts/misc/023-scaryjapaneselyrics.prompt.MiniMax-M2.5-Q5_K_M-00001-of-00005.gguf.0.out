The song is about a restaurant in a forest that shouldn't exist. The narrator is a guest who has been led there by acorns (perhaps following a trail of acorns, or perhaps the acorns are a symbol of being lost or drawn in). The restaurant has no reservations, no other patrons, and the "small birds" are laughing at the narrator's expense. The red painted tin roof, the string instruments playing in the kitchen, the "recommendations only" menu—it's all designed to lure the narrator deeper in.

The refrain "Welcome, welcome, eat your fill and then sleep" makes the intent clear: this is not a place of hospitality but of consumption. The narrator is the meal. The "hand-fed bear cub dancing" suggests something cute and harmless on the surface, but in context it's a trap—everything here is designed to disarm. The dishes listed (carpaccio, paella, appetizers, risotto) are elaborate, but there is no dessert—because *the narrator* is the dessert. And the line "we'll deliver it even to the grave" confirms it: this is a one-way trip. "Tomorrow is tomorrow, et cetera" implies the cycle continues, or that death is just another day in this place.

The literal, non-metaphorical reading is that this is a fairy-taile-style predator. A forest spirit, a witch, a monster—something that lures the lost and the desperate with the promise of warmth and food, only to devour them. The "acorns" might be literal breadcrumbs, or they might be the souls of previous victims. The "empty pockets" and "person who forgot" could mean the narrator has lost something (memory, identity, life) and is therefore vulnerable to being "found" by this place.

It's a dark fairy tale about being eaten by the thing that promised you a meal. The mischief is in the cheerful tone—the waltz-like rhythm, the playful listing of dishes—making the horror cute and almost inviting. That's what makes it unsettling. [end of text]
