<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to output lines that have comments. In bash script, comments start with # not in shebang? Shebang line starts with #! but that's not a comment? Usually it's not a comment but a shebang. The query: "all lines with comments". Should we include shebang? Probably not, because it's not a comment. But line 1 starts with #!/bin/bash, not a comment. So exclude.

Lines with # anywhere: line 4 "# Save the path...", line 15 "# This is a script...", line 20 "# Download and build pkg-config", line 29 "# Download and build ncurses", line 38 "# Download and build libevent", line 48 "# Download and build utf8proc", line 56 "# Download and build tm

Also line 1? Not comment. So we output those lines with line numbers and then "---". Provide each line exactly as in input.

Let's list:

4: # Save the path to ./download_check script
15: # This is a script to build and install tmux on macOS without homebrew.
20: # Download and build pkg-config
29: # Download and build ncurses
38: # Download and build libevent
48: # Download and build utf8proc
56: # Download and build tmux

Also line 1? Not comment. So ignore.

Check if any other lines have inline comments after code? None.

Thus output each line with line number and then "---". Ensure format: "4:# Save the path to ./download_check script" maybe there is a space after colon? Input shows "4:# Save..." Actually line numbers are part of input? The input includes line numbers and colon. So we output exactly as given.

Thus produce:

4:# Save the path to ./download_check script
---
15:# This is a script to build and install tmux on macOS without homebrew.
---
20:# Download and build pkg-config
---
29:# Download and build ncurses

38:# Download and build libevent

48:# Download and build utf8proc

56:# Download and build tmux
