<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to output lines that are comments. In bash script, comments start with # not in shebang? Shebang line starts with #! but that's not a comment (though it's a special line). Usually comment lines are those where first non-whitespace character is #, but not #!. The query: "all lines with comments". Should include comment lines, maybe also inline comments after code? The script has no inline comments after code except maybe none. Let's scan:

Line 1: #!/bin/bash -> shebang, not a comment. Probably not considered comment. Might be excluded.

Line 4: # Save the path to ./download_check script -> comment.

Line 15: # This is a script to build and install tmux on macOS without homebrew. -> comment.

Line 20: # Download and build pkg-config -> comment.

Line 29: # Download and build ncurses -> comment.

Line 38: # Download and build libevent -> comment.

Line 48: # Download and build utf8proc -> comment.

Line 56: # Download and build tmux -> comment.

Also there may be blank lines with just numbers? Not comments.

Thus output lines 4,15,20,29,38,48,56. Also maybe line 1? Usually shebang is not a comment. The query says "lines with comments". Shebang is not a comment. So exclude.

We need to output line number and line content exactly as in input, then "---". Format: "4:# Save the path to ./download_check script". The input includes colon after line number. We'll preserve that.

Thus produce:

4:# Save the path to ./download_check script
---
15:# This is a script to build and install tmux on macOS without homebrew.
---
20:# Download and build pkg-config
---
29:# Download and build ncurses
---
38:# Download and build libevent
---
48:# Download and build utf8proc
---
56:# Download and build tmux
---

Check line numbers: ensure correct. Let's verify line numbers from input:

1:#!/bin/bash
2:set -ex
3:
4:# Save the path to ./download_check script
5:script_path=...
...
15:# This is a script to build and install tmux on macOS without homebrew.
...
20:# Download and build pkg-config
...
29:# Download and build ncurses
...
38:# Download and build libevent
...
48:# Download and build utf8proc
...
56:# Download and build tmux

Yes.

Now output.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>4:# Save the path to ./download_check script

15:# This is a script to build and install tmux on macOS without homebrew.
