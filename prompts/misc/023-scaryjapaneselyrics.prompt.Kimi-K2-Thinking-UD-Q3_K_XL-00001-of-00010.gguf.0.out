The user wants me to interpret the story told by these Japanese lyrics. The melody is described as lighthearted and slightly mischievous. The key constraint is that there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, not just metaphorical.

Let me analyze the lyrics line by line:

1. ドングリを辿っても着きません (Even if you follow the acorns, you won't arrive)
2. 森の小さなレストラン (A small restaurant in the forest)
3. 空っぽのポケットを弄って (Fiddling with empty pockets)
4. 忘れた人から辿り着く (You arrive from having forgotten)
5. 予約は一つもありません (There are no reservations at all)
6. 森の小さなレストラン (A small restaurant in the forest)
7. 空席だらけのランチ時 (Lunchtime with nothing but empty seats)
8. 小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる (Little birds are fluttering and laughing)

9. 真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根 (A tin roof painted bright red)
10. メニューはおすすめ そればかり (The menu is only recommendations)
11. 厨房の方から聞こえてる (Coming from the kitchen direction)
12. バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ (Violin, flute, cello, viola)

13. ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい (Welcome, welcome, come in)
14. たらふく食べたらお眠りよ (If you eat your fill, you'll fall asleep)
15. それでは皆さんさようなら (Well then everyone, goodbye)
16. 明日は明日で エトセトラ (Tomorrow is tomorrow, etcetera)

17. 右から左へおおわらわ (Great commotion from right to left)
18. 手乗りの子熊も踊り出す (Even the handheld baby bear starts to dance)
19. カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル (Carpaccio, paella, hors d'oeuvres)
20. リゾット デザートはありません (Risotto, there is no dessert)
21. お墓の中まで届けましょう (We'll deliver even into your grave)
22. 今宵は最後のフルコース (Tonight is the final full course)

Key fantastical elements:
- Following acorns to a restaurant
- Restaurant in the forest
- Empty pockets but you can still arrive
- Forgotten people arriving
- No reservations, empty seats at lunch
- Birds laughing/fluttering
- Red tin roof
- Menu is only "recommendations"
- String/wind music from kitchen
- "Eat your fill and you'll sleep" (sounds like enchantment or poison)
- "Goodbye everyone" and "tomorrow is tomorrow" (fatalistic?)
- Baby bear dancing on hand
- Specific fancy dishes mentioned
- No dessert
- Delivery "even into your grave"
- "Final full course tonight"

This has strong Alice in Wonderland vibes, or a Ghibli-style magical place. The "eat your fill and you'll sleep" combined with "delivery into your grave" and "final full course" suggests this might be a restaurant for the dead, or a place that leads to death. The "forgotten people" arriving suggests people who have been forgotten by the living. The empty pockets suggest you don't need money. The red tin roof is like a marker. The birds laughing suggests they're not normal birds. The baby bear dancing adds to the surreal, whimsical nature.

The "final full course" and "delivery into your grave" strongly suggests this is a restaurant that serves the dead, or serves a last meal before death. The "forgotten people" could be the deceased who have been forgotten by the living. The "empty pockets" could mean you no longer have worldly possessions when you're dead. The "no reservations" and "empty seats" suggests it's always ready for more dead souls. The "eat your fill and you'll sleep" is a gentle euphemism for death. The "tomorrow is tomorrow" has a "whatever will be, will be" feeling, appropriate for the afterlife.

But the user wants at least one LITERAL interpretation in a fantastical setting. So I need to construct a concrete narrative:

Literal fantastical interpretation:
This is a restaurant in the afterlife/limbo, specifically for souls who have been forgotten. It's located deep in a magical forest that you can only find by following acorns (like a magical path). You don't need money (empty pockets). The restaurant is run by magical beings (birds laughing, baby bear dancing). The menu is only recommendations because you don't really choose - you get what you need for your final journey. The music from the kitchen is played by ghostly or magical musicians. The meal is your final one (last full course), and after eating it, you fall asleep (die permanently/pass on). They'll deliver the meal even to your grave. The "forgotten people" are the souls of those who died alone and unmourned. The restaurant gives them one last beautiful meal before they move on.

The tone is lighthearted and mischievous despite the dark subject matter, which fits the "slightly mischievous" melody description. It's like a whimsical, slightly sinister afterlife cafe.

Let me structure my answer:
1. Main literal fantastical interpretation (the afterlife restaurant)
2. Alternative interpretations (could be metaphorical)
3. Key themes and symbols

I should not just translate but explain the narrative arc. The story seems to be: A lost soul (or a living person who stumbles in) finds this magical forest restaurant. It's a place for those who are forgotten or have forgotten themselves. You don't need money. The staff welcomes you, feeds you a magnificent last meal, and after you eat, you fall asleep - presumably dying or moving to the next world. The restaurant serves anyone, even delivering to graves. It's a final, whimsical send-off for those who might otherwise pass alone.

The "mischievous" element comes from the playful presentation of death, the birds laughing, the dancing bear, and the casual "etcetera" about tomorrow. It's not grim; it's a gentle, slightly cheeky approach to mortality.

Let me make sure I address the user's requirement: "at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical." So I need to be clear that this is a concrete magical place, not just a metaphor for death.

The narrative arc:
- How to get there: follow acorns (magical path), you arrive when you've been forgotten or have forgotten
- The setting: small forest restaurant, red tin roof, empty at lunch, birds laughing
- The staff: welcoming, possibly magical creatures (birds, baby bear)
- The meal: fancy dishes, no dessert (since it's the last meal), eat until you sleep
- The outcome: you fall asleep after eating, it's your final meal, they deliver to graves
- The philosophy: accepting, whimsical, "tomorrow is tomorrow"

This is very reminiscent of films like "The Nightmare Before Christmas" or Ghibli's more whimsical afterlife imagery, or even the concept of "shinigami" but in a restaurant setting. The "mischievous" tone comes from presenting something dark (death, being forgotten) in a playful, lighthearted way.

I should present this clearly as a story summary.The lyrics tell the story of a **magical afterlife restaurant** hidden in a forest that serves as a final resting stop for forgotten souls.
