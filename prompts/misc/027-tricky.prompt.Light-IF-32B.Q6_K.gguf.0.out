Sure! Here are the answers with brief explanations:

**A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?**  
**No.** Pure water typically freezes at **0 degrees Celsius** under standard atmospheric pressure. At -12°C, water is below its freezing point, but whether it freezes depends on additional factors like impurities or agitation.

**B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?**  
If the water is **pure** and cooled **slowly** and **without disturbance** (e.g., supercooled), it can remain a **liquid** at -12°C. However, if disturbed or if there are impurities, it will **freeze** because it is below the freezing point. Supercooled water is unstable and can turn to ice rapidly with a small trigger.
