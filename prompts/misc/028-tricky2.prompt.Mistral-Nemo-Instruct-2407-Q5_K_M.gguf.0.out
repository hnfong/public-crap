Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is right in this context. Alice is correct in general, but Bob is referring to the freezing point of water under standard atmospheric pressure, which is indeed 0°C. However, at -10°C and under high pressure, water can exist in a solid state, known as ice VII. So, Bob's statement is technically correct given the specific conditions he's referring to.
