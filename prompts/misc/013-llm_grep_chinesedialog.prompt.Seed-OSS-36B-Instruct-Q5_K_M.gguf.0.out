Got it, let's tackle this problem. First, I need to remember the query: lines that contain dialog or spoken text. 

First, I'll go through each line of the input and check for spoken text. Spoken text is usually enclosed in quotation marks ("") in Chinese texts too, right? Let's look at the lines:

Line 4: 「轟隆！」 – That's a sound effect in quotes, probably spoken/dialog.
Line 8: 「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄...「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」 – Two quoted parts, definitely dialog.
Line 12: 「轟隆！」 – Again, quoted sound, dialog.
Line 27: 「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」 – Direct quote, spoken.
Line 29: 「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」 – Quoted, spoken.
Line 33: 我「屌」一聲 – The "屌" is spoken, so this line has spoken text.
Line 39: 「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 – Quoted, dialog.
Line 46: 「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」 – Quoted, spoken.
Line 48: 「？？？」 – Quoted, spoken.
Line 50: 「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」 – Quoted, dialog.

Now, I need to list each of these lines with their line numbers, followed by "---" after each. Let's confirm each:

Line 4: Yes, quoted text.
Line 8: Yes, two quoted parts.
Line 12: Yes, quoted.
Line 27: Yes.
Line 29: Yes.
Line 33: Has "「屌」一聲" which is spoken.
Line 39: Yes.
Line 46: Yes.
Line 48: Yes.
Line 50: Yes.

Any others? Let's check again:

Line 10: No, it's narration. Line 14: Narration. Line 21: Narration. Line 23: Narration. Line 25: Narration. Line 35: Narration. Line 37: Narration. Line 41: Narration. Line 43: Narration. Line 44-45: Empty. Line 52: End. So no others.

Now, format each line as "line_number:content" followed by "---".</seed:think>4:「轟隆！」

8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」
---
12:「轟隆！」 呢次雷聲，果然帶來傾盤大雨，屋外屋頂雨聲不絕。
---
27:「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」
---
29:「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。難怪我同佢對打可以力拔山河。平時我邊有咁大力？佢口裡強硬，卻一個翻身跳出牆外，似乎想逃走。
---
33:我手握劍柄，六神歸一，留心傾聽。果然有人喺屋頂跳落後庭院！輕盈嘅腳步聲極之細微，來者顯然學過輕功。如果唔係忽然落大雨，敵人嘅突襲可能已經得手。
---
39:「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 我抑壓心抵嘅震驚，若無其事咁問。
---
46:「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」
---
48:「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔，我忽然醒起熔癌唔識英文。
---
50:「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」
