Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants me to perform a semantic "grep" on the given input, specifically looking for lines that contain dialog or spoken text. 

First, I need to understand what exactly constitutes "dialog or spoken text." From the query, it seems that any line with quoted speech or dialogue markers should be included. For example, lines with quotation marks like `` or '' or dialogue indicators like 「」 or other symbols that denote speech.

Looking at the input provided, I'll go through each line one by one:

Line 1: `# 呆總嘅老豆` - This seems like a comment or a title, not dialog. So, skip.

Line 2: Empty line. No dialog here.

Line 3: Another empty line. Ignore.

Line 4: ``「轟隆！」`` - This is a sound effect, not dialog. So, skip.

Line 5: Empty line. Ignore.

Line 6: `平靜嘅夜空，竟然響起乾雷。` - This is a narrative statement, not dialog. Skip.

Line 7: Empty line. Ignore.

Line 8: ``「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」`` - Here, there are dialog markers with quotation marks. The speaker is talking, so this should be included.

Line 9: Empty line. Ignore.

Line 10: `我望住屋外天色，月光一早被黑雲淹沒，濕氣極重。欽天監今次仲唔掛黑色暴雨警告的話，聽朝睇怕會有十萬人上書皇上，叫佢炒咗嗰班粉腸。` - This is a narrative, no dialog. Skip.

Line 11: ``「轟隆！」 呢次雷聲，果然帶來傾盤大雨，屋外屋頂雨聲不絕。`` - Again, sound effect followed by a narrative. No dialog here. Skip.

Line 12: Empty line. Ignore.

Line 13: `屋頂 ⋯⋯ 多咗一個人。` - Narrative. Skip.

Line 14: Empty line. Ignore.

Line 15: `我喺呢間屋已經孤獨度過十八個寒暑，屋頂落雨嘅滴嗒聲每一個細節，一早了然於胸。` - Narrative. Skip.

Line 16: Empty line. Ignore.

Line 17: Empty line. Ignore.

Line 18: Empty line. Ignore.

Line 19: Empty line. Ignore.

Line 20: `屋頂 ⋯⋯ 多咗一個人。` - Wait, this is the same as line 13. Maybe a typo? But still, no dialog. Skip.

Line 21: `我手握劍柄，六神歸一，留心傾聽。果然有人喺屋頂跳落後庭院！輕盈嘅腳步聲極之細微，來者顯然學過輕功。如果唔係忽然落大雨，敵人嘅突襲可能已經得手。` - Narrative. Skip.

Line 22: ``「嘭！」一聲被踢爆。`` - Sound effect, not dialog. Skip.

Line 23: `好在老夫力拔山河氣蓋世，雖然咁樣斬法我把寶劍肯定見財化水，但刀劍相交嘅時候，我感覺到對方力氣似乎比我大大不如。` - Narrative. Skip.

Line 24: ``「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」`` - Dialogue with quotation marks. Definitely include.

Line 25: ``「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。難怪我同佢對打可以力拔山河。平時我邊有咁大力？佢口裡強硬，卻一個翻身跳出牆外，似乎想逃走。`` - The first part is dialogue in quotes, the rest is narrative. So, the quoted part is dialog and should be included.

Line 26: Empty line. Ignore.

Line 27: `「！！！」 黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我。佢點都估唔到我認得呢把劍。原來係熔癌派人追殺我。` - The ``「！！！」`` is a sound or expression, but not dialog. The rest is narrative. So, skip.

Line 28: Empty line. Ignore.

Line 29: `我提劍急追，佢見我迫近，回身一劍，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕。` - Here, `我「屌」一聲` is a dialogue marker. The speaker is expressing frustration, so include this line.

Line 30: Empty line. Ignore.

Line 31: Empty line. Ignore.

Line 32: `「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」` - Dialogue in quotes. Include.

Line 33: `「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔，我忽然醒起熔癌唔識英文。` - The ``「？？？」`` is a dialogue marker. Include.

Line 34: `「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」` - Dialogue in quotes. Include.

Line 35: Empty line. Ignore.

Line 36: `【完】` - This is an ending marker, not dialog. Skip.

So, compiling the lines that contain dialog or spoken text, we have lines 8, 24, 25, 29, 32, 33, and 34. Each of these lines has either quoted speech or dialogue indicators, making them relevant to the query.
