Yo, listen up, let me break it down for you,
'Bout the Fed, the central bank, it's true,
They're like the OGs, runnin' the game,
Controllin' the money, makin' the economy feel the same.

They're like the bank for banks, the big cheese,
Helpin' the economy grow, if you please,
They print the cash, and regulate the flow,
Makin' sure the money's movin', don't you know.

They're like the referees, keepin' it fair,
Makin' sure the economy's balanced, showin' they care,
They watch the interest rates, like a hawk in the air,
Makin' sure the economy's growin', without a single care.

They're like the safety net, catchin' the fall,
Helpin' the economy recover, standin' tall,
They're like the fire department, puttin' out the flames,
Makin' sure the economy's stable, no more games.

They're like the economists, with the PhDs,
Studyin' the numbers, makin' sure the economy's on the rise,
They're like the strategists, makin' the moves,
Makin' sure the economy's strong, like a groove.

So when you hear about the Fed, don't be confused,
Just know they're the ones, who make the moves,
Helpin' the economy grow, and keep it in check,
The Federal Reserve, they're on the deck. [end of text]
