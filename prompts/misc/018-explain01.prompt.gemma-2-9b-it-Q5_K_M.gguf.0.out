Yo, lemme break it down for ya, 'bout the Fed, the money game's boss
They the ones who keep the economy flowin', ain't no time to floss
Think of 'em like the DJ, spinnin' the tracks of the nation's wealth
Adjustin' the beat, keepin' things smooth, avoidin' a financial stealth

They got these tools, like interest rates, they raise 'em, the money slows
Lower 'em down, the cash starts movin', like a beat that everyone knows
Inflation's a monster, gotta keep it in check, ain't no room for a fright
Fed steps in, cools things down, keeps the economy tight

They printin' money, yeah, but not like you printin' rhymes on a page
It's digital, yo, in the system, keepin' things in a steady gauge
They watchin' the market, the stocks, the bonds, the whole financial scene
Makin' sure it ain't crashin', keepin' the flow clean

So next time you hear 'bout the Fed, remember they the ones in control
Keepin' the money game runnin' smooth, keepin' the economy whole.
