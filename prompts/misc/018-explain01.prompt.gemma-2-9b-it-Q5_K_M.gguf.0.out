Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

Yo, lemme break it down for ya, 'bout the Fed, the money game's boss
They the ones who keep the economy flowin', ain't no time to floss
Think of 'em like the DJ, spinnin' the tracks of the nation's wealth
Adjustin' the beat, keepin' things smooth, avoidin' a financial stealth

They got these tools, like interest rates, they raise 'em, the money slows
Lower 'em down, the cash starts pumpin', everybody knows
Inflation's a beast, gotta keep it tamed, prices stayin' chill
Fed steps in, adjusts the flow, keeps the market from gettin' ill

They printin' money, yeah, but not like you printin' rhymes
It's a delicate balance, gotta keep it tight, all the time
Too much cash, the value drops, like a beat that's outta time
Too little, the economy sleeps, ain't no hustle, no climb

So next time you hear 'bout the Fed, remember their role
Keepin' the money game steady, keepin' the economy whole
They the unseen hand, workin' behind the scenes, yo
Makin' sure the cash keeps flowin', so the whole world can grow.
