This is a story told through emojis. It begins with a princess in a castle with her family, including a king. The next scene shows the princess looking in a mirror, admiring her beauty and royal status. However, the story takes a dark turn as the princess becomes evil and bites into a poisoned apple, leading to her death. The next scene shows a bear, a squirrel, and a bird mourning over the princess's body. The final scene shows a prince kissing the princess, bringing her back to life, and the two falling in love. This story is likely a retelling of the classic fairy tale "Snow White."
