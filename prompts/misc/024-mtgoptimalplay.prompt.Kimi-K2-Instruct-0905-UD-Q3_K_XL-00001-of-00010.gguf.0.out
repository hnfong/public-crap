Alice’s only realistic goal is to kill Orim, Samite Healer before Bob ever gets another turn.  
She has two physical cards, both named Kindle, in her hand.  
Bob has no cards in hand and only one relevant permanent: the untapped Orim.  
Mana is not a constraint for either player (Bob’s lands are tapped, but he can still use Orim’s ability).

-------------------------------------------------
1.  What the cards actually do
-------------------------------------------------
Kindle – instant  
“Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards **named Kindle in all graveyards**.”  
- The bonus is counted **on resolution**, not on announcement.  
- Each Kindle is a separate spell, so the first one to resolve sees 0 other Kindles in graveyards, the second one sees 1, etc.

Orim, Samite Healer – 1/3 legendary creature  
“Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.”  
- This is an **activated ability**.  
- It can be used **any time Alice has priority**, costs only the tap symbol, and can target any permanent or player.  
- Once the ability resolves, a “shield” is created that will stop the **next 3 damage** that would be dealt to that target **this turn**.  
- The shield is used up **one point at a time**; if 1 damage is prevented, 2 points remain, etc.  
- Bob can respond to any spell or ability by activating Orim.

-------------------------------------------------
2.  The damage math
-------------------------------------------------
- Kindle #1 resolves: 2 + 0 = 2 damage.  
- Kindle #2 resolves: 2 + 1 = 3 damage.  
Total raw damage available this turn: 2 + 3 = 5.  
Orim’s toughness is 3, so **three damage marked on her in the same turn is lethal**.  
Therefore **Alice does not need both Kindles to hit for full value**; she only needs **three damage to get through after prevention**.

-------------------------------------------------
3.  Sequencing and responses
-------------------------------------------------
Alice must cast the two Kindles in **two separate rounds of priority** (they are two spells).  
Bob’s only legal action is to activate Orim while the spells are on the stack.  
Because Bob is tapped out he cannot do anything **except** use Orim’s **free** tap ability.

-------------------------------------------------
Optimal line for Alice
-------------------------------------------------
1.  Cast Kindle #1 targeting Orim.  
   - Bob lets it resolve (he has no mana to do anything else).  
   - 2 damage is dealt.  
   - Orim is now a 1/3 with **2 damage marked** – one more damage this turn will kill her.

2.  **Hold priority** and cast Kindle #2 **while the first Kindle is still on the stack**.  
   - Bob **must** choose now whether to tap Orim to prevent damage from **the next spell** (Kindle #2) or to save the activation for later.  
   - If Bob **does not** activate now, Alice will let both Kindles resolve in order:  
     – Kindle #1 deals 2 → Orim now has 2 damage.  
     – Kindle #2 deals 3 → 2 + 3 = 5 total, so Orim dies.  
   - Therefore Bob **must** activate Orim **in response to Kindle #2** to have any chance of survival.

3.  Bob activates Orim’s ability in response to Kindle #2, tapping her and creating a “prevent the next 3 damage” shield on herself.

4.  Alice has nothing else to do; both spells resolve:  
   - Kindle #1 still resolves first (it was put on the stack first) and deals its 2 damage.  
     Orim’s shield is **not yet in effect**, so the 2 damage is **not prevented**; she now has 2 damage marked.  
   - Kindle #2 resolves next.  
     The shield is now in place, so **3 damage is prevented**.  
     Orim remains a 1/3 with **2 damage marked** – still alive.

-------------------------------------------------
4.  State after the sequence
-------------------------------------------------
- Orim is tapped, has 2 damage marked, and is still 1/3.  
- Both Kindles are in the graveyard (so any future Kindle this turn would deal 4, but Alice has no more).  
- Bob’s board: tapped 1/3 Orim with 2 damage.  
- Alice’s hand: empty.  
- Bob will untap Orim on his next turn; Alice has no further reach.

-------------------------------------------------
5.  Could Alice do better?
-------------------------------------------------
No.  
- She cannot “stack” both Kindles and then somehow make the prevention apply to only part of the damage – prevention shields apply to the **next** damage event that would occur **after** the shield is created.  
- She cannot force Bob to waste the activation: if she ever passes priority with a Kindle on the stack, Bob can simply wait, see how much damage will actually be dealt, and activate only if necessary.  
- The **maximum damage she can guarantee to push through in one turn is 2**, and that is exactly what the line above achieves.

-------------------------------------------------
Outcome
-------------------------------------------------
Alice casts both Kindles in the same layer of priority.  
Bob responds to the second Kindle by tapping Orim and preventing its 3 damage.  
Kindle #1 deals 2 (not prevented), Kindle #2 deals 0 (prevented).  
Orim survives with 2 damage marked, taps, and will untap on Bob’s next turn.  
Alice has no cards left and cannot finish the job; Bob keeps his creature. [end of text]
