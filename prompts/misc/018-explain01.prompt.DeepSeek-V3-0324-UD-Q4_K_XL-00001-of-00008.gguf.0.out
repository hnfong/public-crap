**Yo, listen up, let me break it down real quick,**  
**The Fed’s the boss when it comes to the money trick.**  

**They print the cash, control the flow,**  
**Too much dough? They pump the brakes slow.**  

**Interest rates? That’s the price to borrow,**  
**High or low, they set the tempo.**  

**Banks get loans, then pass it to you,**  
**Cheap or steep—Fed’s call, it’s true.**  

**Inflation wild? They tighten the grip,**  
**Money tight, so prices dip.**  

**But if the game’s too slow, they drop the rate,**  
**More cash in play to stimulate.**  

**They watch the streets, the jobs, the buys,**  
**Keep the economy from highs to lows, no lies.**  

**So when you hear “The Fed’s on deck,”**  
**They run the money—show ‘em respect!**
