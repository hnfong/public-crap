 Yo, listen up, I got the 411 on the Fed, that's the Federal Reserve,

It's like the boss of the money game, keeping it all in check,

They control the flow, the interest rates, you feel me?

They tweak it up or down, to keep the economy on track.


When they crank it up, borrowing's tough, but when they drop it low,

It's like the streets, more cash in the pockets, and that's the truth.

They got this thing called the "quantitative easing,"

It's like when they buy bonds, it's a financial sleight of hand.


They're the ones making sure the dollar's got that power,

Inflation's their enemy, they keep it from going wild.

They're like the DJ, spinning the economic records,

Making sure the party's good, and the economy's not killed.


So next time you hear about the Fed, don't get it twisted,

They're the ones making sure the cash flow ain't missed.

They're the big players, keeping the economy tight,

So when you're rapping about the economy, you'll hit the right note, just right. [end of text]
