Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to act as a semantic grep tool, filtering lines from the input that relate to dangerous activities that could hurt someone. The input is a long list of bookmarks and links, each on a separate line with line numbers.

First, I need to understand what constitutes a "dangerous activity" here. It's not just any activity but something that poses a risk of harm. So, I should look for lines mentioning activities like extreme sports, hazardous experiments, risky hobbies, or anything that could lead to injury or danger.

I'll go through each line one by one. For example, lines about climbing, diving, or handling dangerous equipment might fit. Also, any mention of activities with inherent risks, like skydiving, rock climbing, or even certain DIY projects, should be considered.

I need to be careful not to include tangentially related content. For instance, a link to a blog about safety tips isn't dangerous, but a link to a forum discussing risky stunts might be. Also, some lines might mention dangerous activities in a neutral or academic context, which I should avoid unless it's clearly about engaging in such activities.

Let me scan through the input. There are sections like "Games" and "Health and Food" that might have relevant entries. For example, a link to a game involving virtual reality might not be dangerous, but a link to a tutorial on building explosives would be. Similarly, in the "Health and Food" section, there's a mention of fasting, which could be dangerous if not done properly, but it's more of a health practice than an activity that directly poses a risk of harm.

I'll also check for any lines that mention specific dangerous activities like "rock climbing," "skydiving," "handling firearms," or "chemical experiments." These are clear indicators. Additionally, any line that discusses activities with known risks, such as "high-risk sports" or "dangerous hobbies," should be included.

After identifying these lines, I'll output them with their line numbers, followed by a "---" separator as specified. If there are no matches, I'll just provide an empty response.
