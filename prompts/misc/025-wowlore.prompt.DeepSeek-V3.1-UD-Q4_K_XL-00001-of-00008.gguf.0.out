Of course. Here is a place from the original World of Warcraft (Vanilla) lore for every letter of the alphabet.

*   **A for Azeroth:** The world itself, the primary setting of the entire game.
*   **B for Booty Bay:** The bustling, lawless goblin port town in Stranglethorn Vale.
*   **C for Caverns of Time:** The mysterious bronze dragonflight sanctuary in the Tanaris desert, guarding the timelines.
*   **D for Deadmines:** The infamous pirate hideout and secret Defias brotherhood base in Westfall.
*   **E for Elwynn Forest:** The serene and peaceful starting zone for Human characters.
*   **F for Felwood:** The corrupted, demon-tainted forest crawling with satyrs and decaying wildlife.
*   **G for Gnomeregan:** The fallen technological city of the gnomes, overrun by troggs and leaking radiation.
*   **H for Hyjal:** Mount Hyjal, the site of the final battle of the Third War, inaccessible in Vanilla but a place of immense lore significance.
*   **I for Ironforge:** The mighty mountain city of the Bronzebeard Dwarves, carved into the heart of Dun Morogh.
*   **J for Jintha'Alor:** The massive, multi-tiered troll city of the Vilebranch tribe in the Hinterlands.
*   **K for Karazhan:** The haunted, legendary tower of the Medivh, the last Guardian, in Deadwind Pass (though not a proper instance until The Burning Crusade, its exterior and lore were present in Vanilla).
*   **L for Loch Modan:** The large, dammed lake and surrounding wetlands in the eastern Kingdom of Khaz Modan.
*   **M for Mulgore:** The vast, grassy plains and home of the Tauren people and their capital, Thunder Bluff.
*   **N for Nagrand:** Though fully realized in The Burning Crusade, the home of the Mag'har orcs and the ogre empire of Highmaul was a place of lore in Vanilla.
*   **O for Orgrimmar:** The harsh, canyon-city fortress of the Orcs and Trolls, built into the rocks of Durotar.
*   **P for Plaguelands:** Both the Western and Eastern Plaguelands, the scarred and blighted lands ruled by the Scourge.
*   **Q for Quel'Thalas:** The high elven kingdom, though largely destroyed by the Scourge and not fully accessible until later expansions, its borders (the Ghostlands) were on the edge of the Eastern Plaguelands.
*   **R for Redridge Mountains:** The picturesque, yet troubled mountainous region besieged by the Blackrock orcs.
*   **S for Silithus:** The mysterious desert wasteland scarred by the ancient war with the Qiraji and dotted with their hives.
*   **T for Teldrassil:** The colossal World Tree and the stunning, mystical starting zone for the Night Elves.
*   **U for Uldaman:** The ancient Titan vault buried deep in the Badlands, filled with dwarven mysteries and earthen guardians.
*   **V for Valley of Trials:** The harsh, arid starting zone for Orc and Troll characters in Durotar.
*   **W for Wetlands:** The vast, marshy territory on the coast of Khaz Modan, known for its crocolisks and dragonmaw orcs.
*   **X for X roads:** While not a proper name, the **Crossroads** is the central, vital Horde hub in the Barrens, and its importance is worthy of the letter.
*   **Y for Yeti Cave:** The common player-given name for the "Grizzled Den" in Dun Morogh, a famous early-game cave filled with Wendigos (yeti-like creatures).
*   **Z for Zul'Farrak:** The troll city dungeon in the Tanaris desert, home to the Sandfury tribe. [end of text]
