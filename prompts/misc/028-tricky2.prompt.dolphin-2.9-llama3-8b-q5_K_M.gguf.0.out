Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is right. Water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius, not 0 degrees Celsius. The misconception arises because the freezing point of water is commonly misperceived as being 0 degrees Celsius, but it is actually -10 degrees Celsius. [end of text]
