Both Alice and Bob are partially right, but Alice is more accurate.

- **Alice** correctly states that water freezes at **0 degrees Celsius**, which is the standard freezing point under normal atmospheric pressure.
- **Bob** says water freezes at **-10 degrees Celsius**, which is technically true in the sense that water remains frozen *below* 0Â°C, but it's not the precise temperature at which freezing begins.

So while Bob's statement isn't wrong per se, **Alice is right** in pointing out the exact temperature at which water starts to freeze. [end of text]
