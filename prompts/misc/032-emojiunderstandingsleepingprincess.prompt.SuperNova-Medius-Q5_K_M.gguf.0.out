This appears to be a series of emoji that tell a story or convey a sequence of events. While it's not directly referencing any specific popular culture, it does remind me of a few things:

1. **Emoji Storytelling**: This is reminiscent of how some social media platforms and apps use emoji to create short stories or convey complex ideas in a simple, visual format. It's a way of storytelling that has become increasingly popular, especially among younger audiences.

2. **Social Media Memes**: The use of emoji in this way is also similar to how memes are created and shared on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok. These platforms often feature short, visually-driven narratives that can be quickly understood and shared.

3. **Children's Storybooks**: The simplicity and visual nature of the emoji sequence also reminds me of children's storybooks, where a series of pictures tells a story without the need for extensive text. Each emoji or emoji combination could represent a character, an action, or a setting, much like the illustrations in a picture book.

4. **Emoji Comics**: Some social media users and artists create short comics or narratives using only emojis. This is a form of visual storytelling that relies on the viewer's ability to interpret the sequence of images and understand the narrative being conveyed.

The specific sequence of emoji you've provided doesn't directly reference a known story or character, but it does follow a pattern that could be interpreted as a narrative. For example, it might be telling a story about a princess (👸), her interactions with others (👨‍👩‍👧‍👦), a conflict or challenge (👑😠), and possibly a resolution or a happy ending (🤴😘💍👸💖). However, the exact interpretation would depend on the viewer's imagination and the context in which these emoji are being used. [end of text]
