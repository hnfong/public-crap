Here are the answers with brief explanations:

A) No, water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. -12 degrees Celsius is below the freezing point, but it's not the temperature at which water freezes.

B) If a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will likely remain in a supercooled state, meaning it will remain liquid below its freezing point. This is because the water molecules need a nucleation site, such as a tiny impurity or imperfection, to start the freezing process. If the water is pure and undisturbed, it can remain supercooled until it is disturbed or reaches a temperature at which it rapidly freezes, a process known as flash freezing. [end of text]
