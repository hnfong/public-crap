If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

A theory that proves itself is called "consistent" because it does not lead to contradictions. However, it is also considered "tautological" because it is self-evident and does not provide any new information or insights. Here are some examples of such theories:

1. **First-order logic**: This is a formal system that includes axioms and rules of inference that allow for the construction of logical statements. It proves itself because it is self-evident that the rules of inference are valid and that the axioms are true.

2. **Propositional logic**: This is a formal system that includes axioms and rules of inference that allow for the construction of propositional statements. It proves itself because it is self-evident that the rules of inference are valid and that the axioms are true.

3. **Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF)**: This is a formal system that includes axioms and rules of inference that allow for the construction of sets. It proves itself because it is self-evident that the rules of inference are valid and that the axioms are true.

4. **Peano arithmetic**: This is a formal system that includes axioms and rules of inference that allow for the construction of natural numbers. It proves itself because it is self-evident that the rules of inference are valid and that the axioms are true.

5. **Euclidean geometry**: This is a formal system that includes axioms and rules of inference that allow for the construction of geometric figures. It proves itself because it is self-evident that the rules of inference are valid and that the axioms are true.

In general, any formal system that is based on self-evident axioms and rules of inference will prove itself. This is because the axioms and rules of inference are true by definition, and any statement that can be derived from them is also true.
