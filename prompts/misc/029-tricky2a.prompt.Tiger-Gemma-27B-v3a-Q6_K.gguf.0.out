Bob is technically right, though misleading. 

While pure water *typically* freezes at 0°C, at -10°C, water *will* be frozen. Bob didn't specify *at what temperature* it freezes, only that it *is* frozen at -10°C. Alice is correct about the freezing *point*, but Bob's statement isn't factually wrong. 

It's a bit of a trick question relying on precision of language. [end of text]
