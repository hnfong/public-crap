Let's analyze the situation step by step.

**Alice's Turn:**

Alice's goal is to kill Orim to prevent Bob from using its ability to block her burn spells. She has two copies of 'Kindle' in her hand, each of which deals 2 + the number of cards named 'Kindle' in all graveyards damage.

Since Orim is already on the battlefield, it will be a threat to Alice's burn spells. However, Alice can use her 'Kindle' cards to deal damage to Orim.

**Option 1: Cast one 'Kindle' and let Bob's Orim block it.**

If Alice casts one 'Kindle', it will deal 2 + 0 = 2 damage to Orim (since there are no 'Kindle' cards in the graveyards yet). Orim will then use its ability to prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. Since Alice's 'Kindle' only deals 2 damage, Orim will block it, and the remaining 1 damage will not be prevented.

However, this leaves Orim still alive, and Alice will need to deal more damage to kill it.

**Option 2: Cast both 'Kindle's and let Bob's Orim block them.**

If Alice casts both 'Kindle's, they will deal a total of 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 damage to Orim (since there are no 'Kindle' cards in the graveyards yet). Orim will use its ability to prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. Since Orim will receive 5 damage (8 total damage - 3 prevented), 3 of the damage will be prevented, and 2 will not be prevented.

However, this still leaves Orim alive, and Alice will need to deal more damage to kill it.

**Optimal Play for Alice:**

The optimal play for Alice is to cast both 'Kindle's. This will deal a total of 8 damage to Orim, and Orim will use its ability to prevent 3 of the damage. This leaves 2 damage that will not be prevented, killing Orim.

**Bob's Turn:**

Since Orim is dead, Bob cannot use its ability to block Alice's burn spells. Alice can now safely cast her remaining burn spells without fear of Orim blocking them.

**Outcome:**

Alice wins the game by killing Orim with her 'Kindle' cards. Bob cannot prevent this outcome, as Orim is already dead.

**Thought Process:**

Alice's thought process is to prioritize killing Orim to prevent it from blocking her burn spells. She has two 'Kindle's in her hand, and casting both will deal enough damage to kill Orim. She needs to calculate the total damage dealt and ensure that Orim's ability cannot prevent all of it.

Bob's thought process is to use Orim's ability to block Alice's burn spells. However, since Alice has two 'Kindle's, Bob cannot prevent all of the damage dealt to Orim. He needs to calculate the damage dealt and ensure that Orim's ability can prevent at least some of it.

In this scenario, Alice's optimal play is to cast both 'Kindle's, and Bob's best effort is to use Orim's ability to prevent some of the damage, but ultimately, Alice will win the game. [end of text]
