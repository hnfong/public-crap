<think>We are considering a scenario where Alice has two copies of Kindle in her hand and Bob has an untapped Orim, Samite Healer in play. It's Alice's turn, and she has sufficient mana to cast any spells. Bob's lands are tapped out, so he cannot cast any spells during Alice's turn.

Kindle is an instant that deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards.

Currently, there are no Kindles in the graveyard because Alice hasn't cast any yet. So if she casts one Kindle, it would deal 2 damage (since X = 2 + 0 = 2). However, after she casts the first Kindle, it goes to the graveyard, so if she casts a second Kindle, it would deal 3 damage (since X = 2 + 1 = 3).

Alice wants to kill Orim, which has 1 toughness. But Bob can use Orim's ability to prevent damage. Orim's ability is: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." Bob can activate this ability in response to Alice's spell to prevent damage to Orim.

Alice's goal is to kill Orim. She has two Kindles. She can cast them in sequence, but Bob can respond to each Kindle by activating Orim's ability to prevent damage.

Let's break down the optimal play for both players.

Alice's turn: Alice has two Kindles and sufficient mana. She can cast one Kindle targeting Orim. Bob can respond by activating Orim's ability to prevent the next 3 damage. Since Kindle deals 2 damage, the prevention will prevent all 2 damage, and Orim survives. Then the first Kindle resolves and goes to the graveyard. Now, there is one Kindle in the graveyard.

Alice can then cast the second Kindle targeting Orim. Now, the second Kindle deals 3 damage (2 + 1). Bob can again respond by activating Orim's ability. But note: Orim is already tapped? Orim's ability requires tapping Orim. After Bob activated the ability in response to the first Kindle, Orim became tapped. So when Alice casts the second Kindle, Orim is tapped. Bob can still activate Orim's ability because it doesn't require untapped? Actually, the ability says "Tap: ...", so it requires tapping the creature. If the creature is already tapped, Bob cannot activate it again because tapping is part of the cost and he can't pay the cost if the creature is already tapped.

Therefore, after the first Kindle, Orim is tapped and Bob cannot activate Orim's ability again until it untaps. But it's Alice's turn, and Bob doesn't have any untap step during Alice's turn. So Bob cannot activate Orim's ability again during Alice's turn.

So if Alice casts the first Kindle, Bob prevents the damage and Orim survives, but Orim becomes tapped. Then Alice casts the second Kindle, which deals 3 damage. Bob cannot prevent that damage because Orim is tapped and he cannot activate the ability again. Therefore, Orim takes 3 damage and dies because it has 1 toughness.

But wait: Bob might have other responses? Bob has no cards in hand, so he cannot cast any spells. He only has Orim's ability. So after the first Kindle, Orim is tapped, so he cannot prevent the second Kindle's damage.

Therefore, Alice can kill Orim by casting both Kindles in sequence.

However, Alice might consider if she can cast both Kindles at the same time? She cannot because they are instants and she can cast them one at a time. She can cast the first Kindle, then after Bob responds, she can cast the second Kindle. But note: Bob can only activate Orim's ability once per turn because after the first activation, Orim is tapped and he cannot activate it again.

But what if Alice casts both Kindles without giving Bob a chance to respond? Actually, she cannot. She casts one spell, then Bob gets priority to respond. After Bob responds, the first Kindle resolves, then Alice gets priority again and she can cast the second Kindle. So Bob gets a chance to respond to each spell.

So the sequence:

1. Alice casts the first Kindle targeting Orim. Bob responds by activating Orim's ability, tapping Orim to prevent the next 3 damage. This prevents the 2 damage from the first Kindle. The first Kindle resolves and deals 0 damage to Orim (because prevented) and goes to the graveyard. Now there is one Kindle in the graveyard.

2. Alice then casts the second Kindle targeting Orim. Now, Bob cannot activate Orim's ability because Orim is already tapped. So the second Kindle deals 3 damage (2+1). Orim has 1 toughness, so it dies.

Thus, Orim dies.

But wait: Bob might have a trick? Bob has no cards in hand, so he cannot cast any spells. He only has Orim's ability, which he can only activate once per turn because tapping is a cost and he cannot pay the cost again if the creature is tapped.

Therefore, Alice can kill Orim by casting both Kindles.

However, Alice might worry about Bob having other responses? The problem states that Bob has no cards in hand, so he cannot cast any spells. Also, Bob's lands are tapped out, so he cannot cast any spells even if he had any.

So the optimal play for Alice is to cast both Kindles in sequence, targeting Orim. Bob will prevent the first one, but the second one will kill Orim.

But what if Alice casts the second Kindle in response to Bob's activation? Let's see:

Alice casts the first Kindle. Bob responds by activating Orim's ability. Now, before the first Kindle resolves, Alice can cast the second Kindle? Yes, she can. Because Bob's activation is on the stack, then Alice gets priority again. She can cast the second Kindle targeting Orim. Now the stack has:

- The first Kindle (dealing 2 damage to Orim)
- Bob's activation (preventing next 3 damage)
- The second Kindle (dealing 3 damage to Orim)

Now, Bob cannot activate Orim's ability again because he already activated it and Orim is tapped. Also, he cannot respond to the second Kindle because he has no spells and his ability is already activated.

Now, the stack resolves:

First, the second Kindle would resolve? No, the stack resolves from top to bottom. So the top item is the second Kindle? Actually, when Alice casts the second Kindle, it goes on top of the stack. So the stack is:

- Second Kindle (top)
- Bob's activation
- First Kindle (bottom)

So the second Kindle resolves first. It deals 3 damage to Orim. Orim has 1 toughness, so it would die. But Bob's activation is still on the stack and it prevents the next 3 damage. However, the damage from the second Kindle is dealt before Bob's activation resolves. So the damage is dealt, and Orim takes 3 damage and dies. Then Bob's activation resolves, but it doesn't matter because Orim is already dead.

Alternatively, if Bob's activation resolves first, it prevents the next 3 damage. Then the second Kindle deals 3 damage, but it is prevented. Then the first Kindle deals 2 damage, but that is also prevented? But note: Bob's activation prevents the next 3 damage. It doesn't specify which damage. It prevents the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target. So if Bob's activation resolves before the second Kindle, it prevents the next 3 damage. Then when the second Kindle resolves, it deals 3 damage, which is prevented. Then the first Kindle resolves, dealing 2 damage, but the prevention has already been used up? The activation says "prevent the next 3 damage". So if it prevents 3 damage from the second Kindle, then the prevention is used up. Then the first Kindle would deal 2 damage to Orim, which would kill it because Orim has 1 toughness.

But wait, the order of the stack: if Alice casts the second Kindle in response to Bob's activation, then the stack is:

- Second Kindle
- Bob's activation
- First Kindle

Bob's activation is on the stack. Bob cannot do anything else. So the second Kindle resolves first, dealing 3 damage. Then Bob's activation resolves, preventing the next 3 damage. But the damage has already been dealt, so the prevention doesn't prevent that damage. Then the first Kindle resolves, dealing 2 damage. Orim takes 3 damage from the second Kindle and 2 damage from the first Kindle, but it only has 1 toughness, so it dies from the second Kindle.

Alternatively, if Bob's activation resolves before the second Kindle, that would require Bob to have a way to put his activation on top of the stack? But Bob cannot do that. He only responds once. The activation is already on the stack. Alice can cast the second Kindle on top of it, so the second Kindle is above Bob's activation. So the second Kindle resolves first.

Therefore, regardless of whether Alice casts the second Kindle before or after Bob's activation resolves, Orim will die because the second Kindle deals 3 damage and Bob cannot prevent it because he has already used Orim's ability and Orim is tapped.

But note: if Alice casts the second Kindle after Bob's activation resolves, then Bob's activation prevents the next 3 damage. Then the second Kindle deals 3 damage, which is prevented. Then the first Kindle deals 2 damage, which kills Orim. So Orim dies either way.

However, if Alice casts the second Kindle before Bob's activation resolves, then the second Kindle deals 3 damage and kills Orim immediately, and Bob's activation doesn't prevent that damage because it hasn't resolved yet. Then Bob's activation resolves but prevents nothing because Orim is dead.

So in both cases, Orim dies.

But Alice might worry about Bob having other responses? Bob has no cards in hand, so he cannot cast any spells. Also, Bob's lands are tapped out, so he cannot cast any spells. So Bob cannot do anything else.

Therefore, the optimal play for Alice is to cast both Kindles in sequence, targeting Orim. Bob will prevent the first one, but the second one will kill Orim.

But wait: what if Alice casts the first Kindle and Bob does not activate Orim's ability? Then the first Kindle deals 2 damage, which kills Orim because it has 1 toughness. Then Alice doesn't need to cast the second Kindle. But Bob would not let that happen. Bob wants to save Orim. So Bob will activate Orim's ability to prevent the damage. So Bob will respond to the first Kindle by activating Orim's ability.

So Bob's optimal play is to activate Orim's ability in response to the first Kindle to prevent the damage.

Then Alice can cast the second Kindle to kill Orim.

So the outcome is that Orim dies.

But note: Bob might activate Orim's ability in response to the second Kindle? But he cannot because he already activated it in response to the first Kindle and Orim is tapped. So he cannot activate it again.

Therefore, the optimal play for Alice is to cast both Kindles. Bob will prevent the first one, but the second one will kill Orim.

However, Alice might consider if she can cast both Kindles at once? She cannot because they are instants and she must cast them one at a time. But she can cast them in quick succession, giving Bob a chance to respond to each. But Bob can only prevent one of them because he can only activate Orim's ability once.

So the outcome is that Orim dies.

But wait: what if Bob activates Orim's ability in response to the second Kindle? But he cannot because he already activated it in response to the first Kindle and Orim is tapped. So he cannot activate it again.

Therefore, the plan works.

But let's consider if Alice casts the first Kindle and Bob activates Orim's ability. Then the first Kindle resolves and deals 0 damage. Then Alice casts the second Kindle. Bob cannot activate Orim's ability again. The second Kindle deals 3 damage, killing Orim.

So Orim dies.

Alternatively, if Alice casts the second Kindle first? But she has to cast one at a time. She could cast the second Kindle first? But then the second Kindle would deal 2 damage? No, because at the time she casts the second Kindle, there are no Kindles in the graveyard. So if she casts one Kindle without having cast any before, it deals 2 damage. So if she casts the second Kindle first, it deals 2 damage. Bob can prevent that damage by activating Orim's ability. Then Orim survives and becomes tapped. Then Alice can cast the first Kindle, which now deals 3 damage (because there is one Kindle in the graveyard). But Bob cannot prevent that damage because Orim is tapped. So Orim takes 3 damage and dies. So again, Orim dies.

So regardless of the order, if Alice casts both Kindles, Orim dies.

But note: if Alice casts the first Kindle and Bob prevents it, then the first Kindle goes to the graveyard. Then Alice casts the second Kindle, which deals 3 damage. Bob cannot prevent it. Orim dies.

If Alice casts the second Kindle first, Bob prevents it, then the second Kindle goes to the graveyard. Then Alice casts the first Kindle, which now deals 3 damage (because there is one Kindle in the graveyard). Bob cannot prevent it. Orim dies.

So in both orders, Orim dies.

Therefore, the optimal play for Alice is to cast both Kindles. Bob will prevent one of them, but the other will kill Orim.

But wait: what if Bob prevents the second Kindle? Then the first Kindle would deal 3 damage? Let's see:

If Alice casts the second Kindle first, Bob prevents it, then the second Kindle deals 0 damage and goes to the graveyard. Then Alice casts the first Kindle, which now deals 3 damage (2+1). Bob cannot prevent it, so Orim takes 3 damage and dies.

If Alice casts the first Kindle first, Bob prevents it, then the first Kindle deals 0 damage and goes to the graveyard. Then Alice casts the second Kindle, which deals 3 damage, Bob cannot prevent it, Orim dies.

So in both cases, Orim dies.

Therefore, the outcome is that Orim dies.

But note: Bob might have a way to untap Orim during Alice's turn? Bob has no cards in hand and his lands are tapped out. He cannot cast any spells to untap Orim. So he cannot untap Orim during Alice's turn.

So the optimal play for Alice is to cast both Kindles. Bob will prevent one of them, but the other will kill Orim.

However, Alice might worry about Bob having other responses? The problem states that Bob has no cards in hand, so he cannot cast any spells. Also, Bob's lands are tapped out, so he cannot cast any spells. So Bob cannot do anything else.

Therefore, the outcome is that Orim dies.

But let's consider the exact damage prevention. Bob's ability prevents the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target. So if Bob activates it in response to the first Kindle, it prevents the next 3 damage. The first Kindle deals 2 damage, which is prevented. Then the second Kindle deals 3 damage. The prevention effect is still active? The prevention effect says "prevent the next 3 damage". It has already prevented 2 damage, so it has 1 damage left to prevent. So when the second Kindle deals 3 damage, the prevention effect would prevent the next 1 damage? Then the second Kindle would deal 2 damage instead of 3? Orim has 1 toughness, so 2 damage would still kill it.

Wait, let's clarify: Bob's ability prevents the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target. It doesn't specify which target. It prevents the next 3 damage from any source to any target. So if Bob activates it in response to the first Kindle, it prevents the next 3 damage. The first Kindle deals 2 damage, which is prevented. Then the prevention effect has 1 damage left to prevent. Then the second Kindle deals 3 damage. The prevention effect prevents the next 1 damage, so the second Kindle deals 2 damage to Orim. Orim has 1 toughness, so it dies.

So even if Bob prevents the first Kindle, the second Kindle still deals 2 damage, which is enough to kill Orim.

But wait: what if Bob activates the ability in response to the second Kindle? Then the second Kindle would be prevented? But Bob cannot activate it in response to the second Kindle if he already activated it in response to the first Kindle, because Orim is tapped. So he can only activate it once.

So if Alice casts the first Kindle, Bob responds by activating Orim's ability, preventing the next 3 damage. Then the first Kindle deals 2 damage, which is prevented. Then the second Kindle is cast. Bob cannot activate again. The second Kindle deals 3 damage. The prevention effect still has 1 damage left to prevent. So the second Kindle's damage is reduced by 1, so it deals 2 damage. Orim dies.

If Alice casts the second Kindle first, Bob responds by activating Orim's ability, preventing the next 3 damage. Then the second Kindle deals 2 damage, which is prevented. Then the first Kindle is cast, which now deals 3 damage (because there is one Kindle in the graveyard). Bob cannot activate again. The prevention effect has already prevented 2 damage, so it has 1 damage left to prevent. So the first Kindle's 3 damage is reduced by 1, so it deals 2 damage. Orim dies.

So in both cases, Orim takes 2 damage and dies.

Therefore, the outcome is that Orim dies.

But note: if Bob activates the ability in response to the first Kindle, and then the first Kindle deals 2 damage, which is prevented, then the prevention effect has 1 damage left. Then if Alice casts the second Kindle, it deals 3 damage, which is reduced by 1 to 2 damage, killing Orim.

If Bob activates the ability in response to the second Kindle, then the second Kindle deals 2 damage, which is prevented, then the first Kindle deals 3 damage, which is reduced by 1 to 2 damage, killing Orim.

So regardless of the order, Orim takes 2 damage and dies.

Therefore, the optimal play for Alice is to cast both Kindles. Bob will prevent one of them, but the other will still deal 2 damage, which is enough to kill Orim.

But wait: what if Bob does not activate the ability at all? Then the first Kindle deals 2 damage, which kills Orim. So Bob must activate the ability to save Orim. But he can only save one Kindle, and the other will kill Orim.

So the outcome is that Orim dies.

Therefore, the optimal play for Alice is to cast both Kindles. Bob will prevent one of them, but the other will kill Orim.

But note: Alice might worry about Bob having other responses? The problem states that Bob has no cards in hand, so he cannot cast any spells. Also, Bob's lands are tapped out, so he cannot cast any spells. So Bob cannot do
