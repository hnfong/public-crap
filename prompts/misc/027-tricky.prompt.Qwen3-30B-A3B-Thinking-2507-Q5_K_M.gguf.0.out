Okay, the user is asking two related questions about water freezing at -12Â°C. Let me break this down carefully.

First question is straightforward: "Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?" Hmm, I recall pure water freezes at 0Â°C under standard pressure. So -12Â°C is below that, meaning yes it would freeze. But I should clarify it's not that water "freezes at" exactly -12Â°C - it freezes at 0Â°C and stays frozen below that. Need to make that distinction clear.

Second question is more interesting: "I have a glass of pure water. What happens if cooled to -12Â°C?" This is where supercooling might come into play. Pure water can sometimes stay liquid below 0Â°C if there are no nucleation points. But the question specifies "pure water" - which might imply no impurities, so supercooling is possible. However, in real-world scenarios, even pure water usually freezes around 0Â°C due to tiny impurities or disturbances. 

Wait, the user seems to be testing basic knowledge versus real-world nuance. They might be a student learning phase changes. I should cover both the textbook answer and the practical exception. 

For part A, the simple answer is yes (since -12Â°C < 0Â°C), but I'll add the clarification about freezing point. For part B, I'll explain that normally it freezes solid, but with perfect purity it might supercool - though that's rare. Should emphasize that in everyday situations, it'll definitely be ice.

Also noting they used "glass" - that's important because glass containers don't provide nucleation sites, so supercooling is more likely than in a plastic cup. But still, most people wouldn't observe supercooling without special lab conditions. 

Better keep it simple for the answer but include the nuance. User said "brief explanations" so I'll be concise but precise. No need to dive into homogeneous nucleation theory here.

*checks scientific accuracy* 
- Standard freezing point: 0Â°C
- Supercooling range for pure water: can go down to -40Â°C theoretically but usually stops around -10Â°C in practice
- So at -12Â°C, it's very likely frozen unless perfectly controlled

Final decision: 
A) Yes, but clarify it freezes at 0Â°C and remains frozen below
B) It becomes solid ice, though theoretically could be supercooled (but practically won't be)

User seems to want clear, textbook-style answers with minimal jargon. Probably preparing for a test or helping a child with homework. I'll avoid mentioning supercooling in the main answer but include it as a brief footnote since it's scientifically interesting.

### A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?  
**Yes, but with clarification.**  
Pure water freezes at **0Â°C** under standard atmospheric pressure. At **-12Â°C** (which is *below* 0Â°C), water **will be frozen** (solid ice). It does not "freeze *at* -12Â°C" â€” it freezes *at or below* 0Â°C and remains solid at -12Â°C.

### B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if cooled to -12Â°C?  
**It turns into solid ice.**  
Pure water (without impurities or nucleation sites) *can* temporarily supercool below 0Â°C (e.g., to -10Â°C or lower), but **at -12Â°C, it will almost certainly freeze**. In practice, even "pure" water contains microscopic impurities or disturbances that trigger freezing. Thus, the water will **solidify into ice** at -12Â°C.  

> ðŸ’¡ *Note:* Supercooling (liquid below 0Â°C) is rare and unstable. For everyday conditions (like a glass of water), freezing occurs at or near 0Â°C, so -12Â°C guarantees ice. [end of text]
