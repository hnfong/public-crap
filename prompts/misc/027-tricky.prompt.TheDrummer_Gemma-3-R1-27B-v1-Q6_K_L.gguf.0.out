Here are the answers with brief explanations:

**A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?**

**No.** Water *normally* freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). However, at -12°C, **pure water remains a liquid if it's not disturbed.** This is due to a phenomenon called **supercooling**.

**B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?**

If cooled *slowly and carefully* without disturbance, the pure water will **supercool** and remain a liquid at -12°C. It's in a metastable state. However, **any disturbance** (like a vibration, impurity, or even just touching the glass) will **instantly trigger rapid freezing** into ice. The water will solidify very quickly, often with a visible burst of ice crystal formation.



**Key takeaway:** Pure water can exist as a liquid below its normal freezing point (0°C) if it's supercooled and undisturbed. But it's unstable and will freeze rapidly with any trigger. [end of text]
