◁think▷Okay, let's tackle this task. The user wants 8 evaluation questions for LLMs with specific constraints. Let me go through each constraint step by step.

First, the questions need to be simply stated, concise. So no long paragraphs. Each question should be within a paragraph or two. That's manageable.

Next, varying levels of difficulty from Q1 (easy) to Q8 (hard). So I need to structure the questions in order of increasing difficulty. The first few should be straightforward, maybe basic knowledge, and then get more complex, perhaps requiring reasoning or specific domain knowledge.

They can be in English or Chinese, with a mix. So I should alternate between the two languages. Maybe start with English, then Chinese, and so on. But how to split them? Let's see. The example given was Q0 in English. Maybe the even-numbered questions are in Chinese and the odd in English? Or vice versa. Wait, the user said "ideally a mix of both". So perhaps 4 in each language. Let me plan that. For example, Q1, Q3, Q5, Q7 in English, and Q2, Q4, Q6, Q8 in Chinese. That way, there's a mix.

The topics should be wide-ranging. So each question should cover different subjects. Let's think: history, science, literature, current events, math, etc. Also, the answers need to be assessable objectively. So no open-ended essays, but maybe short answers or multiple choice. The user mentioned that open form is acceptable as long as there's a way to check. So perhaps some questions can have specific answers, others multiple choice.

Now, the creative part. The English questions must contain a word with "z", and Chinese questions must use the character "平". That's a challenge. Let's start with English. For example, Q1 could be about "zoology" or "zodiac", but maybe something more interesting. Wait, the example given had "Mark Zuckerberg", which has a 'z'. So perhaps using names or terms that include 'z'. For example, "What is the capital of New Zealand?" (Wellington), but that's a bit too easy. Maybe a more challenging one. Alternatively, a question about the element "zinc" or "zirconium". Or perhaps a historical figure like "Zhu Xi" (but that's Chinese). Hmm.

For Chinese questions, the character "平" (píng) is common. It can mean "peace", "flat", etc. So maybe a question like "What is the meaning of the Chinese character '平'?" But that's too simple. Or perhaps a question about a historical event where "平" is part of the name. For example, "平型关大捷" (a battle in WWII), but that's specific. Alternatively, a question about a Chinese idiom that includes "平".

Now, structuring the questions. Let's start with Q1 as easy. Maybe in English. Let's think of a simple question that includes a 'z'. For example, "What is the name of the largest planet in our solar system that starts with 'z'?" Wait, there's no such planet. Oh right, the planets are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. None start with 'z'. Hmm. Maybe a different approach. How about a question about the letter 'z' itself. Like, "In the English alphabet, which letter comes immediately before 'z'?" That's easy. The answer is 'y'. But maybe that's too trivial. Alternatively, a question about a country that starts with 'z', like Zambia or Zimbabwe. For example, "Which African country's name starts with 'z' and is known for its Victoria Falls?" The answer would be Zimbabwe. But maybe that's a bit more challenging. Alternatively, a question about a famous person with a 'z' in their name. Like, "Who wrote the novel 'The Great Gatsby'?" The answer is F. Scott Fitzgerald, but 'Gatsby' has a 'z'. Wait, no, 'Gatsby' is spelled G-a-t-s-b-y. No 'z' there. Hmm. Maybe a different approach.

Alternatively, a question about the element "zirconium". "What is the atomic number of zirconium?" The answer is 40. That's a bit more specific. But maybe not everyone knows that. So perhaps for Q1, an easier question. Let's try: "What is the name of the popular search engine that starts with 'G' and ends with 'le'?" The answer is Google. But wait, the question must contain a word with 'z'. Wait, the user's example had "What is Mark Zuckerberg infamous for?" which includes 'Zuckerberg'. So maybe the question can include a word with 'z' in it. So perhaps: "What is the name of the social media platform founded by Mark Zuckerberg?" The answer is Facebook. That's easy and includes 'Zuckerberg' in the question. So that's a good candidate for Q1.

Then Q2 in Chinese. Let's think of a question that includes the character "平". For example, "中国的和平共处五项原则是什么?" (What are China's Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence?) The answer would list the five principles. But maybe that's a bit long. Alternatively, a simpler question. Like, "平字在中文里最常见的意思是什么?" (What is the most common meaning of the character '平' in Chinese?) The answer could be "和平" (peace) or "平坦" (flat). But maybe the most common is "和平". So that's a possible Q2.

Then Q3 in English. Need a question with 'z'. Maybe something about geography. "Which country is known as the 'Land of the Rising Sun' and starts with a letter that comes after 'z' in the alphabet?" Wait, no letters come after 'z'. Hmm. Alternatively, "What is the name of the ocean that lies between Asia and the Americas and has a 'z' in its name?" The answer is the Pacific Ocean. Wait, 'Pacific' doesn't have a 'z'. Hmm. Maybe a different approach. How about a question about a movie. "What is the name of the 1994 animated film by Disney that features a lion named Simba and has a 'z' in its title?" The answer is "The Lion King". Wait, the title doesn't have a 'z', but maybe the question can include a word with 'z'. For example, "What is the name of the 1994 animated film by Disney that features a lion named Simba and was directed by a person whose last name starts with 'z'?" Wait, the directors of The Lion King were Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff. Neither last name starts with 'z'. Hmm. Maybe a different movie. Alternatively, a question about the band "Led Zeppelin". "What is the name of the English rock band that was formed in 1968 and has a 'z' in its name?" The answer is Led Zeppelin. That's a good one. So that could be Q3.

Then Q4 in Chinese. Need a question with "平". Maybe a historical event. "平型关大捷是哪一年发生的?" (In which year did the Pingxingguan Victory occur?) The answer is 1937. That's a specific date. But maybe not everyone knows that. Alternatively, a question about a Chinese province. "中国的和平省是哪个省?" Wait, there's no province named "和平省". Maybe a different approach. How about a question about a Chinese idiom. "请解释'心平气和'这个成语的意思." (Explain the meaning of the idiom '心平气和'.) The answer would be something like "calm and composed". That's a valid question.

Then Q5 in English. Need a question with 'z'. Maybe a science question. "What is the name of the particle that is emitted during beta decay and has a 'z' in its name?" The answer is neutrino. Wait, 'neutrino' doesn't have a 'z'. Hmm. Alternatively, "What is the name of the element with atomic number 30?" The answer is zinc. That's a good one. So the question would be "What is the name of the element with atomic number 30 that starts with 'z'?" The answer is zinc. But atomic number 30 is zinc. So that's correct.

Then Q6 in Chinese. Need a question with "平". Maybe a question about a city. "中国的平遥古城是位于哪个省份?" (Which province is the Pingyao Ancient City located in?) The answer is Shanxi. That's a specific question.

Then Q7 in English. Need a question with 'z'. Maybe a literature question. "What is the name of the novel written by F. Scott Fitzgerald that features a character named Jay Gatsby and has a 'z' in its title?" The answer is "The Great Gatsby". The title has 'Gatsby', which has a 'z'. So that's a good one.

Finally, Q8 in Chinese. Need a question with "平". Maybe a more challenging one. "请用'平'字组一个词，并解释其意思." (Create a word using the character '平' and explain its meaning.) For example, "平等" (equality), "平静" (calm), etc. But this might be a bit open-ended. Alternatively, a question about a specific event. "在中国历史上，'平定三藩'指的是哪三藩?" (In Chinese history, which three feudatories were involved in the 'Pingding Sanfan' event?) The answer would be the three feudatories that rebelled during the Qing dynasty. This is a more specific question.

Now, let's check the difficulty levels. Q1 is easy (Facebook), Q2 is easy (meaning of 平), Q3 is medium (Led Zeppelin), Q4 is medium (idiom explanation), Q5 is medium (element zinc), Q6 is medium (Pingyao location), Q7 is medium (The Great Gatsby), Q8 is hard (historical event details). But maybe the difficulty isn't strictly increasing
