Both are technically correct but talking past each other.

**Bob is right** about what *actually happens* to water at -10°C: it's ice (frozen).

**Alice is right** about the *freezing point* (the phase transition temperature).

The confusion: Alice interpreted Bob's "it freezes" as claiming -10°C is the freezing point. But Bob meant "at that temperature, water is in a frozen state" — which is true. Water *is* frozen at -10°C; it just *became* frozen at 0°C.

Bob's final claim ("I'm still right") holds up: water at -10°C is indeed frozen, even if that's not where the phase change occurs. [end of text]
