Alright, imagine the National People’s Congress in China is like a big club of grown-ups who get together to decide important rules for everyone in China. They talk about things like how much money the country should spend, what laws should be, and who should be in charge of different things.

Just like in your school, you have a class meeting where you all talk and decide what games to play or how to share toys, the National People’s Congress is like a super big class meeting for all of China. But instead of toys and games, they talk about big things that affect lots and lots of people.

So, if you were in China, the people in this big club help decide many of the rules that everyone has to follow, just like teachers and headteachers help make rules at your school. [end of text]
