## The Optimal Play: Alice Casts One Kindle, Bob Responds with Orim's Ability

Here's the breakdown of the optimal play and the reasoning for both players, referencing Magic: The Gathering rules as of 2024:

**Alice's Thought Process:**

* **Goal:** Kill Orim, Samite Healer.
* **Resources:** Two copies of Kindle, sufficient mana.
* **Orim's Threat:** Prevents the next 3 damage. Alice needs to deal at least 4 damage to kill Orim.
* **Kindle's Damage Calculation:** Kindle deals X damage, where X = 2 + (number of Kindles in all graveyards).
* **First Kindle:** If Alice casts one Kindle, it will deal 2 + 0 (since no Kindles are in any graveyard yet) = 2 damage. This is insufficient to kill Orim.
* **Second Kindle:** If Alice casts both Kindles at once, the first Kindle will deal 2 damage. After the first Kindle resolves, the card goes to Alice's graveyard. The second Kindle then calculates its damage as 2 + 1 (one Kindle in Alice's graveyard) = 3 damage. Total damage dealt is 2 + 3 = 5 damage. This *would* kill Orim.
* **However:** Bob can respond to the first Kindle with Orim's ability.
* **Optimal Play:** Alice casts **one** Kindle targeting Orim. This forces Bob to respond.

**Bob's Thought Process:**

* **Goal:** Prevent Orim from dying.
* **Threat:** Alice has two Kindles. If Alice casts both, Orim will die.
* **Response:** Alice casts one Kindle. Bob can activate Orim's ability to prevent the next 3 damage.
* **Optimal Play:** Bob **activates Orim's ability** in response to Alice casting the first Kindle, targeting Orim with the ability.

**The Sequence of Play & Resolution (with timestamps for clarity):**

1. **Alice (T1):** Casts Kindle targeting Orim. (Alice pays mana, puts Kindle on the stack).
2. **Bob (T1):** In response to Alice's Kindle, Bob activates Orim's ability: "{Tap}: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." (Bob taps Orim, puts the prevention ability on the stack).
3. **Stack Resolution (LIFO - Last In, First Out):**
   * **Bob's Orim Ability Resolves First:** Orim's ability resolves. It puts a prevention effect on the stack that will prevent the next 3 damage dealt to Orim this turn.
   * **Alice's Kindle Resolves Second:** Alice's Kindle resolves. It deals 2 damage to Orim. However, the prevention effect from Orim's ability is now active. The 2 damage is reduced to 0 damage (2 - 2 = 0, then 0 - 1 = 0). Orim takes 0 damage.
4. **Alice's Turn Continues:** Alice's Kindle goes to her graveyard.
5. **Alice (T1):** Casts the second Kindle targeting Orim. (Alice pays mana, puts Kindle on the stack).
6. **Bob (T1):** Bob cannot respond. Orim is tapped from the previous activation. Bob has no other resources.
7. **Stack Resolution:**
   * **Alice's Second Kindle Resolves:** The second Kindle calculates its damage as 2 + 1 (one Kindle in Alice's graveyard) = 3 damage. This damage is dealt to Orim.
8. **Outcome:** Orim takes 3 damage. Orim has 1/3 toughness. It dies.

**Why this is optimal:**

* **Alice:** Casting one Kindle forces Bob to use his ability. Casting both at once would allow Bob to respond to the first Kindle with Orim's ability, then the second Kindle would deal 3 damage, killing Orim. By casting one Kindle, Alice ensures Bob *must* use his ability, leaving him unable to prevent the second Kindle's damage.
* **Bob:** Using Orim's ability on the first Kindle is the only way to survive. If he doesn't, the first Kindle deals 2 damage, and the second Kindle deals 3 damage, killing Orim.

**Key Game Mechanics Used:**

* **The Stack:** Spells and abilities go on the stack and resolve in LIFO order.
* **Priority:** Players have priority to cast spells and activate abilities.
* **Instant Speed:** Kindle is an instant, meaning it can be cast during any player's turn when they have priority.
* **Activated Abilities:** Orim's ability is an activated ability that requires tapping Orim and costs no mana.
* **Damage Prevention:** Orim's ability prevents damage, reducing the amount of damage actually dealt.
* **Graveyard Interaction:** Kindle's damage calculation references cards in all graveyards.
* **Creature Death:** A creature with lethal damage (damage equal to or greater than its toughness) dies.

**Final Result:** Alice successfully kills Orim with her two Kindles, forcing Bob to use his prevention ability on the first Kindle and leaving him unable to prevent the second Kindle's lethal damage.
