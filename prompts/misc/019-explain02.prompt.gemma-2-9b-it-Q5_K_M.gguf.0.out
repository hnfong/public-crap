Explain the role of China's National People Congress to a 5 year old child who lives in London.

Imagine your school has a big meeting once a year where everyone gets to vote on important rules for the whole school. That's kind of like China's National People's Congress!

It's a big group of grown-ups from all over China who meet to make important decisions for the whole country. They decide things like how much money the country spends, what new laws should be made, and who will lead the country.

Just like your school needs rules to work well, China needs these decisions to keep everything running smoothly. 


It's like a big team working together to make China a better place for everyone!
