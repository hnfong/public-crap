Imagine your school has a big meeting once a year where everyone gets to vote on important rules for the whole school. That's kind of like China's National People's Congress!

It's a big group of grown-ups from all over China who meet to make important decisions for the whole country. They decide things like how much money the country spends, what new laws to make, and who will lead the country.

Just like your school needs rules to work well, China needs these decisions to keep everything running smoothly. 


So, the National People's Congress is like the big decision-makers for China! [end of text]
