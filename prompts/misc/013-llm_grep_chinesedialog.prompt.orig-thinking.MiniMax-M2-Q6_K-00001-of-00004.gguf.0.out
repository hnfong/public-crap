The user wants a semantic grep: output lines that contain dialog or spoken text. The input is a Chinese text with some lines containing spoken text in quotes or other markers. We need to output only lines that obviously contain dialog or spoken text. The lines that contain spoken text are those that have quotes 「...」 or "..." or maybe other markers like "哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！" etc. Also lines that have spoken text like "阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。" etc. Also lines that have "！！！" etc. Also lines that have "哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！" etc. Also lines that have "你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！" etc. Also lines that have "你係咪熔癌嘅人？！" etc. Also lines that have "阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。" etc. Also lines that have "我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。" etc. Also lines that have "屌" etc. Also lines that have "哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！" etc. Also lines that have "你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！" etc. Also lines that have "你係咪熔癌嘅人？！" etc. Also lines that have "阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。" etc. Also lines that have "我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。" etc. Also lines that have "屌" etc. Also lines that have "哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！" etc. Also lines that have "你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！" etc. Also lines that have "你係咪熔癌嘅人？！" etc. Also lines that have "阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。" etc. Also lines that have "我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。" etc. Also lines that have "屌" etc. Also lines that have "哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！" etc. Also lines that have "你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！" etc. Also lines that have "你係咪熔癌嘅人？！" etc. Also lines that have "阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。" etc. Also lines that have "我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。" etc. Also lines that have "屌" etc.

We need to output each line that contains dialog or spoken text, with line number and then "---". The user says "If no lines match just give empty response. Don't explain. Just output as if you're a command line program called 'semantic_grep'." So we need to output lines that match.

We need to be careful: The input includes lines with quotes like 「轟隆！」 and 「啊～！」 etc. Those are spoken text. Also lines with "哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！" etc. Also lines with "你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！" etc. Also lines with "你係咪熔癌嘅人？！" etc. Also lines with "阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。" etc. Also lines with "我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。" etc. Also lines with "屌" etc. Also lines with "！！！" etc. Also lines with "？？？" etc. Also lines with "哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！" etc. Also lines with "你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！" etc. Also lines with "你係咪熔癌嘅人？！" etc. Also lines with "阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。" etc. Also lines with "我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。" etc. Also lines with "屌" etc.

We need to decide which lines obviously contain dialog or spoken text. The lines that have quotes are definitely dialog. Also lines that have spoken text without quotes but are clearly spoken by a character, like "哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！" is spoken by the narrator? Actually it's spoken
