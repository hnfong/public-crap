Certainly! Here's a **literal, fantastical interpretation** of the lyrics — one that fits within the whimsical, slightly mischievous tone of the melody, and which makes sense *as a story in a magical world*, not just as metaphor.

### 🌲 *The Forest Restaurant That Only Serves Forgotten People*  

In a quiet, enchanted forest, there exists a tiny, unmarked restaurant — **"The Empty Pocket Restaurant"** — hidden deep within the trees. It has a rusty, red-painted roof, and its menu is written entirely in bold, cheerful script: *"Recommended: Only the recommended!"*  

The restaurant has **no reservations**. It is always **fully available**, even during lunchtime. The birds flutter around the windows, laughing and clapping their wings — not just watching, but *participating* in the atmosphere.  

The kitchen is run by a group of **musical spirits** — a **bassoon, flute, cello, and viola** — who play in harmony from behind the curtain. Their music is the only sound that can be heard from inside, and it seems to *whisper the names of dishes* as they prepare them.  

But here’s the twist:  

You can’t reach the restaurant by following a path — **you can only find it by "playing with an empty pocket"**. That is, if you take a pocket that is completely empty — one with no belongings, no memories, no trace of a person — and *toss it into the forest*, it will begin to *glow*, and the restaurant will appear.  

And the restaurant only serves **people who have forgotten themselves** — those who have lost their names, their pasts, or their sense of identity.  

When you enter, the staff greets you with a cheerful, almost playful tone:  
> *"Welcome! Welcome! Come in and eat freely — after you’ve eaten, you’ll fall asleep."*  

The menu is strange:  
- **Carpaçio** (a dish that tastes like memory)  
- **Paella** (a dish that brings back forgotten places)  
- **Oudoubel** (a dish that makes you remember the wrong things)  
- **Risotto** (a dish that warps time)  
- **No dessert** — because *no one remembers what they wanted to eat after the meal*  

The final course — **"The Last Course"** — is delivered not by a waiter, but by a **mysterious force**. It is said that the restaurant will send the final dish to **the graveyards**, where the forgotten souls rest.  

And when the last dish arrives — a single, glowing plate of **"Bassoon and Cello"** — it is the **last meal** for the forgotten.  

The song ends with a playful, mischievous chant:  
> *"From right to left, ooh-wa-la!  
> Even a little bear with hands on its own feet begins to dance!"*  

This suggests that the restaurant is not just a place — it is a **magical portal** that activates when someone *loses themselves*. The bear dancing is a symbol of the **unconscious joy** that comes when one stops trying to remember and simply *exists*.  

And the final line — *"Tomorrow will be tomorrow, et cetera"* — is not just a closing phrase. It is a **promise**: that even after forgetting, life continues — and tomorrow, someone else will find the empty pocket, and the restaurant will open again.

### Why this works as a literal fantasy:

- The "empty pocket" is a literal object that acts as a key to the restaurant — not a metaphor for emptiness or loss, but a *physical trigger*.
- The "forgotten people" are real, sentient beings who have lost their identity — they are not just metaphors for grief or nostalgia.
- The dishes are real, named meals with magical effects — not just poetic descriptions.
- The bear dancing is a literal event — a magical creature reacting to the restaurant’s energy.
- The delivery to the cemetery is a literal, physical act — the final course is sent to the afterlife, where forgotten souls rest.
- The music (bassoon, flute, cello, viola) is not just background — it is the *kitchen staff*, actively involved in serving.

### In short:  
**This is a story about a magical forest restaurant that only opens when someone loses themselves — and serves them a meal that helps them forget, so they can finally rest.**  

It is a whimsical, slightly eerie tale of memory, identity, and the joy of being forgotten — all delivered with a playful, mischievous tone.  

And yes — it makes literal sense in a fantastical world.  

✨ *Welcome to the Empty Pocket Restaurant. Eat freely. Sleep peacefully. Tomorrow, we’ll see you again.* 🍽️🌳 [end of text]
