 Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Give me your interpretation. You do not have to translate the contents, but you may if you wish.
  The lyrics describe a whimsical and somewhat surreal experience at a small restaurant in the woods. Here's a literal interpretation in a fantastical setting:

The song tells the story of a person who, while wandering through the woods, stumbles upon a small, peculiar restaurant. The restaurant is empty, with no reservations and plenty of empty seats. The atmosphere is lively, with birds chirping and laughing, and the restaurant's roof is painted a bright red. The menu is simple, with only one recommendation, and the kitchen is filled with the sounds of a string quartet playing violin, flute, cello, and viola.

The host welcomes everyone warmly, inviting them to eat to their heart's content and then take a nap. After the meal, the guests say their goodbyes, and the host promises to deliver the meal even to the grave if necessary. The final course is described as the last full course of the night, suggesting a grand finale to the meal.

The lyrics also mention a small bear dancing and the food items like carpaccio, paella, hors d'oeuvres, and risotto, but no dessert. The overall tone is lighthearted and slightly mischievous, fitting the fantastical setting of a magical forest restaurant.

Here is a rough translation of the lyrics:

Following the acorns, you won't arrive
A small restaurant in the forest
Fiddling with empty pockets
You reach it from someone who forgot
There are no reservations
A small restaurant in the forest
Empty seats during lunch
Little birds are laughing "Pata Pata"

A bright red tin roof
The menu is recommended, only that
From the kitchen, you can hear
Violin, flute, cello, viola

Welcome, welcome, come in
Eat to your heart's content and then sleep
Goodbye everyone
Tomorrow is tomorrow, etc.

From right to left, oh what a mess
Even a small bear starts dancing
Carpaccio, paella, hors d'oeuvres
Risotto, no dessert
We'll deliver it to the grave
Tonight is the last full course

This interpretation captures the fantastical elements while keeping the story grounded in a literal sense within a magical forest setting. [end of text]
