Let me break down what this command does step by step:

1. `cat wowfanfic.txt` - reads the fan fiction file
2. `perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'` - splits each line on whitespace and prints each word on its own line
3. `sort` - sorts all the words alphabetically
4. `uniq -c` - counts consecutive identical words and prefixes the count
5. `sort -n` - sorts numerically by count (ascending)
6. `tail -n 20` - shows the last 20 lines (i.e., the 20 most frequent words)

**Probable output:**
You'd see the 20 most frequent words in your fan fiction, listed with their occurrence counts. Given typical English text patterns, you'd likely see:

```
      5 the
      7 of
      8 and
     10 to
     12 a
     15 in
     18 that
     20 he
     22 was
     25 for
     28 on
     30 with
     35 as
     40 his
     45 it
     50 at
     55 by
     60 from
     65 this
     70 you
```

**Linguistic principles involved:**
This demonstrates **Zipf's Law**, which states that in natural language corpora, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. The most common words (like "the", "of", "and") will appear much more frequently than others.

You'll almost certainly see **function words** (articles, prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions) dominating the list, as these make up the grammatical skeleton of English but carry less semantic content than content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives).

The exact counts would depend on your fan fiction's content, length, and style, but the relative frequency pattern would follow these universal linguistic principles. [end of text]
