Let's break down the command step by step and understand what it does, with respect to **basic linguistic principles**.

---

### **Command:**
```bash
$ cat wowfanfic.txt | perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }' | sort |  uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 20
```

---

### **Step-by-step Explanation:**

#### 1. `cat wowfanfic.txt`
- This reads the contents of the file `wowfanfic.txt` into standard input.

#### 2. `perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'`
- This runs a Perl script that:
  - Reads the input line by line.
  - Splits each line into words using whitespace (`\s`).
  - Stores the words in an array `@a`.
  - Prints each word followed by a newline (`print $_ . "\n"`).

#### 3. `| sort`
- This sorts the output of the previous command lexicographically (dictionary order).

#### 4. `| uniq -c`
- This counts the number of times each word appears in the sorted list.
  - `uniq` removes duplicate lines.
  - `-c` adds a count of how many times each line appears.

#### 5. `| sort -n`
- This sorts the output numerically by the count (i.e., from smallest to largest).

#### 6. `| tail -n 20`
- This outputs the last 20 lines of the sorted output.

### **What Does This Command Do?**

This command is **counting the frequency of words** in the file `wowfanfic.txt`, and then **printing the top 20 most frequent words** (in descending order of count).

---

### **Linguistic Principles Involved:**

1. **Tokenization**:
   - The `split(/\s/)`, which splits on whitespace, is a **basic linguistic operation**.
   - It breaks text into **tokens** (words or phrases), which is essential for analyzing language.

2. **Sorting**:
   - `sort` and `sort -n` are **sorting operations** that arrange data in a specific order.
   - Sorting is a **fundamental operation in computational linguistics** for organizing and analyzing text.

3. **Counting and Uniqueness**:
   - `uniq -c` is used to **count occurrences** of each token.
   - This is a **basic statistical operation** in text analysis.

4. **Output**:
   - The final output is a list of the **top 20 most frequent words** in the file.

---

### **Conclusion:**

The command is a **basic text analysis pipeline** that:
- Reads a file,
- Tokenizes it,
- Counts word frequencies,
- Sorts and filters the results,
- And outputs the top 20 most frequent words.

This is a **common approach in natural language processing (NLP)** for analyzing text data.

---

### **Final Answer:**

The command will output the **top 20 most frequent words** in `wowfanfic.txt`, sorted by frequency (descending), and each word will appear once per line. [end of text]
