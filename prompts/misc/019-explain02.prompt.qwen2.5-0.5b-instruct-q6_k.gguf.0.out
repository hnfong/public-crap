Explain the role of China's National People Congress to a 5 year old child who lives in London.

Hey there, little one! Imagine you have a big group of grown-ups who help make rules for your city. That's kind of what the National People's Congress is like. It's like a big group of grown-ups who help make rules for the whole country, including London. They make rules about things like how much money we can spend, how many toys we can buy, and how many people can live in our city. They also help make rules about how we can play and how we can take care of our city. It's a very important group of people who help make sure our city is safe and happy for everyone to live in.
