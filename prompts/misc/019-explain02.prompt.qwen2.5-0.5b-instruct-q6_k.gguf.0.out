Hello there! Imagine you're in a big city called London, and you're a little kid who lives there. The National People's Congress is like a big group of grown-ups who help make rules for the whole country. It's like a big team of superheroes who work together to make sure everyone follows the rules and has a good time. They make decisions about things like how to build new roads, how to make sure everyone has enough food, and how to keep the city safe. It's a very important group of people who help make the country work well for everyone. [end of text]
