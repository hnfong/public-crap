Here are the answers to your questions with brief explanations:

A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of pure water at standard atmospheric pressure is 0 degrees Celsius (°C) or 32 degrees Fahrenheit (°F). At -12°C, water would already be in a solid state, specifically ice, if it had been cooled to that temperature from its liquid state.

B) If you have a glass of pure water and it is cooled down to -12°C, the water would have already frozen into ice well before reaching -12°C. The freezing process would typically occur at 0°C, assuming standard atmospheric pressure. However, in some cases, water can be supercooled below its freezing point without immediately freezing. But once ice nucleation occurs (either spontaneously or through the introduction of an ice crystal), the water would rapidly freeze at 0°C, releasing latent heat in the process. At -12°C, the water would be solid ice. [end of text]
