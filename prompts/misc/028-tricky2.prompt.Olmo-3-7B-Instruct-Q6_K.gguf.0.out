Let's break down the conversation:

**Alice's first question:**  
"What happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius?"

**Bob's answer:**  
"Water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius."

This is **incorrect**. Water freezes at **0°C**, not -10°C. At -10°C, water is **solid (frozen)** because it is below the freezing point of 0°C. So Bob's statement is wrong in the sense that water doesn't "freeze specifically at -10°C"—it just freezes whenever the temperature is below 0°C.

But Bob's point is that water **is frozen** at -10°C, which is **true**. He's saying that at -10°C, water is in its solid (frozen) state, which is correct.

**Alice's rebuttal:**  
"No, water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius."

This is **correct**—the freezing point of water is 0°C. However, this doesn't directly answer Alice's original question about what happens at -10°C. At -10°C, water is indeed frozen, because it's colder than the freezing point.

**Bob's reply:**  
"Yes, but I'm still right."

Here, Bob is probably trying to say that water is frozen at -10°C, which is true, even though the precise temperature at which it *starts* freezing is 0°C. He might be making a distinction between the *point of phase change* (0°C) and the *condition at a lower temperature* (frozen at -10°C).

**Who is right?**

- **If the question is "At what temperature does water freeze?"** — Alice is correct: it's 0°C.
- **If the question is "Is water frozen at -10°C?"** — Bob is correct: yes, because -10°C is below the freezing point.

Bob's answer is **not wrong in substance**, because he correctly states that water is frozen at -10°C. However, his phrasing "Water freezes at -10°C" is misleading because it implies that -10°C is the freezing point, which is inaccurate. But in a practical sense, his answer to Alice's specific question ("What happens to water at -10°C?") is correct: water is solid (frozen).

**In summary:**  
- **Alice is correct about the freezing point (0°C), but not directly answering the original question.**
- **Bob is correct in saying that water is frozen at -10°C**, but his wording is imprecise because it suggests -10°C is the freezing point.
- **Best answer:** Both are partially right, but Bob's response to Alice's specific question is technically correct (water is frozen at -10°C), even if his explanation is a bit misleading.

**Brief explanation:**  
Bob is right in that water is frozen at -10°C, but his statement that "water freezes at -10°C" is not precise because water freezes at 0°C. However, for the context of Alice's question about what happens at -10°C, Bob's answer is correct in its implication. Alice's correction about the freezing point is also correct, but doesn't directly address the state of water at -10°C. [end of text]
