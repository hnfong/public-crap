<think>
I need to figure out the optimal play for both Alice and Bob in this Magic: The Gathering scenario. Alice has two Kindle cards in hand and wants to kill Bob's Orim, Samite Healer. Orim can tap to prevent the next 3 damage to any target. Bob has no cards in hand and is tapped out, so he can only use Orim's ability if it's untapped. Alice has enough mana to cast her spells.

First, recall what Kindle does: it deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of Kindle cards in all graveyards. Since no Kindles are in graveyards yet, the first Kindle will deal 2 damage. After that, if one Kindle is in the graveyard, the next one deals 3 damage, and so on.

Orim has 3 toughness, so it takes 3 damage to destroy it. But Orim can prevent 3 damage by tapping.

Alice wants to kill Orim, so she needs to deal at least 3 damage to it after any prevention.

Bob, with Orim, will try to prevent as much damage as possible to keep Orim alive.

Since Alice has two Kindles, she can cast them at different times or both at once. But Kindle is an instant, so she can cast them whenever she has priority.

The game is on Alice's turn, and Orim is untapped. Bob can activate Orim's ability in response to Alice casting a spell or at any time he has priority.

Alice's goal is to get Orim to have 3 or more damage marked on it without it being prevented.

Bob's goal is to prevent enough damage so that Orim survives.

Let me think about the sequence of actions.

Suppose Alice casts one Kindle targeting Orim. With no Kindles in graveyard, it would deal 2 damage.

In response, Bob can tap Orim to prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. So, if Bob activates this ability, the Kindle's damage would be prevented.

After prevention, Orim takes no damage, and the Kindle goes to the graveyard.

Now, Alice has one Kindle left. She can cast it targeting Orim again.

Now, with one Kindle in the graveyard, this Kindle would deal 3 damage (2 + 1).

Bob has no Orim ability to use since Orim is already tapped, so the 3 damage is dealt, and since Orim has 3 toughness, it is destroyed.

In this case, Orim is destroyed.

But Bob might choose not to prevent the first Kindle.

If Alice casts the first Kindle, and Bob does nothing, then 2 damage is dealt to Orim. Orim now has 2 damage marked on it.

Then Alice can cast the second Kindle. With one Kindle in graveyard, it deals 3 damage to Orim. Orim already has 2 damage, so adding 3 more would be 5, but since it only has 3 toughness, it's destroyed with lethal damage.

But Bob can prevent some of that damage.

After the first Kindle resolves, Orim has 2 damage. Alice casts second Kindle for 3 damage.

Bob can activate Orim's ability in response to the second Kindle to prevent the next 3 damage. Since the ability prevents the next 3 damage that would be dealt, it would prevent all 3 damage from the second Kindle.

So Orim still has only 2 damage, which is not lethal since toughness is 3. So Orim survives with 2 damage.

Then Alice has no more cards, so Orim lives.

In the first scenario, if Bob prevents the first Kindle, then Alice can kill with the second Kindle since Orim is tapped.

If Bob doesn't prevent the first Kindle, then when Alice casts the second Kindle, Bob can prevent that damage, leaving Orim with 2 damage.

So for Bob, if he prevents the first Kindle, Orim dies; if he doesn't prevent the first, and prevents the second, Orim lives.

Therefore, Bob should not prevent the first Kindle and prevent the second one to keep Orim alive.

But let's confirm.

Case 1: Alice casts Kindle 1 targeting Orim.

- If Bob prevents (taps Orim): Damage prevented, Kindle 1 in graveyard. Orim tapped.

Then Alice casts Kindle 2 targeting Orim. Kindle 2 deals 3 damage (since one Kindle in graveyard). Orim is tapped, cannot activate ability, so 3 damage dealt, Orim destroyed.

- If Bob does not prevent Kindle 1: Kindle 1 deals 2 damage to Orim. Kindle 1 in graveyard. Orim has 2 damage, untapped.

Alice casts Kindle 2 targeting Orim for 3 damage.

Bob can activate Orim in response: tap to prevent next 3 damage. So Kindle 2 damage prevented. Orim still has 2 damage, which is less than 3 toughness, so survives.

Thus, Bob can save Orim by not preventing the first Kindle and preventing the second one.

But is there a better play for Alice?

Alice might cast both Kindles at the same time or in a different sequence.

Since Kindle is an instant, Alice could cast one Kindle, and if Bob responds, she can respond to that, but it might get messy.

Alice could cast the first Kindle, and depending on Bob's action, she can decide.

But Bob will act optimally.

Another idea: Alice could cast both Kindles in response to each other or something.

Let's think about the stack.

Suppose Alice casts Kindle 1 targeting Orim. Stack has Kindle 1 on top.

Bob has priority. He can activate Orim's ability.

If he activates it, the ability goes on the stack above Kindle 1.

Then, when the ability resolves, it sets up a prevention shield for the next 3 damage this turn.

Then Kindle 1 resolves, and its damage is prevented by the shield. Kindle 1 goes to graveyard.

Now, Alice can cast Kindle 2 targeting Orim. Since one Kindle in graveyard, it deals 3 damage.

Bob has no way to prevent it since Orim is tapped, so 3 damage, Orim dies.

If Bob does not activate Orim when Kindle 1 is cast, then Kindle 1 resolves, deals 2 damage to Orim, Kindle to graveyard.

Then Alice casts Kindle 2 for 3 damage.

Bob activates Orim in response, prevents the 3 damage.

Orim lives.

So Bob prefers not to activate on the first Kindle.

But Alice might do something different.

What if Alice casts both Kindles at once? Meaning, she puts one Kindle on the stack, then without passing priority, casts the second Kindle? But she can't do that; after casting one spell, she must pass priority before it resolves.

The stack resolves one item at a time, with priority passing between.

So Alice can only put one spell on the stack at a time, then pass priority.

She could hold priority and cast multiple spells, but in Magic, when you cast a spell, you can hold priority to cast another before passing, but that puts multiple spells on the stack.

Let me recall the rules.

Under normal tournament rules, after casting a spell, the active player (Alice) gets priority first. She can choose to hold priority and cast another spell.

So Alice could, for example, cast Kindle 1 targeting Orim, then hold priority and cast Kindle 2 also targeting Orim.

Then the stack has Kindle 2 on top, then Kindle 1 below.

Then Alice passes priority.

Bob gets priority with the stack having Kindle 2 and Kindle 1.

Bob can respond to Kindle 2.

If Bob activates Orim's ability, it goes on top of Kindle 2.

Then the stack: Orim ability, Kindle 2, Kindle 1.

Resolve top to bottom.

First, Orim ability resolves: prevents next 3 damage this turn.

Then Kindle 2 resolves: it deals X damage. What is X? At the time of resolution, how many Kindles in graveyard?

Kindle 2 is resolving now. Kindle 1 is still on the stack, not in graveyard yet. No Kindles in graveyard, so X=2. Kindle 2 deals 2 damage to Orim.

But there is a prevention effect: the next 3 damage is prevented. So this 2 damage is prevented. Kindle 2 goes to graveyard.

Then Kindle 1 resolves. Now, Kindle 1 deals X damage. Kindle 2 is in graveyard, so one Kindle in graveyard, X=3. It deals 3 damage to Orim.

The prevention effect was for the next 3 damage, but it already prevented 2 damage from Kindle 2. Does it have any left?

Orim's ability: "Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."

It prevents the next 3 damage, regardless of source or target. It doesn't specify a single instance; it's a shield that prevents up to 3 damage from any source to any target.

After preventing the 2 damage from Kindle 2, the shield has 1 point left (since 3-2=1).

Then Kindle 1 deals 3 damage to Orim. The prevention shield will prevent 1 of that damage, so 2 damage gets through, and 1 is prevented.

Orim takes 2 damage from Kindle 1.

But Kindle 1 dealt 3 damage, 1 prevented, 2 dealt.

Now, Orim has 2 damage marked on it (from this), but no previous damage? In this sequence, Kindle 2 was prevented, so no damage from it. Kindle 1 dealt 2 net damage after prevention.

Let's track:

After Kindle 2 resolved: 2 damage prevented, so Orim has 0 damage.

Then Kindle 1 resolves: deals 3 damage, prevention shield prevents 1 (since 1 left), so 2 damage dealt to Orim.

Orim now has 2 damage.

Not lethal.

Alice has no more spells, so Orim survives with 2 damage.

But in this case, with both Kindles cast at once, and Bob preventing, Orim ends with 2 damage.

If Bob does nothing in response to both Kindles.

Alice casts Kindle 1, holds priority, casts Kindle 2. Stack: Kindle 2 on top, Kindle 1 below.

Bob passes priority (does nothing).

Then Kindle 2 resolves. At resolution, no Kindles in graveyard (Kindle 1 still on stack), so X=2, deals 2 damage to Orim. Kindle 2 to graveyard.

Then Kindle 1 resolves. Now, Kindle 2 is in graveyard, so X=3, deals 3 damage to Orim. Orim already has 2 damage, now takes 3 more, total 5, destroyed.

But Bob can prevent.

In the case where Bob activates Orim in response to Kindle 2, we had Orim take 2 damage and survive.

But Alice might not want to cast both at once.

Another option: Alice could cast one Kindle, and if Bob prevents it, then she casts the second to kill. If Bob doesn't prevent, she might cast the second, but Bob can prevent that.

Earlier I thought Bob can force Orim to survive by not preventing the first and preventing the second.

But let's see if Alice can do better.

What if Alice casts the first Kindle, and Bob doesn't prevent (as per his optimal play), so Kindle 1 deals 2 damage to Orim.

Now, Alice could, instead of casting the second Kindle immediately, do something else, but she has no other cards. She could pass the turn, but then Bob can untap and use Orim again or something, but Alice wants to kill Orim now.

On her turn, after Kindle 1 resolves, Orim has 2 damage, untapped.

Alice can cast Kindle 2 targeting Orim.

Bob can then activate Orim to prevent the 3 damage.

If Alice doesn't cast Kindle 2 now, and passes to combat or something, but Orim is not attacking, it's Alice's turn, she might attack, but she has no creatures mentioned, so probably no attack.

The problem says Alice has a burn deck, but only two Kindles in hand, no other cards mentioned, so I think we assume no other actions.

So Alice must use the Kindles to kill Orim.

Perhaps Alice can target something else, but there's only Orim to target, I think. Bob has no other permanents mentioned, and players can be targeted, but Alice wants to kill Orim specifically.

The Kindle can target any target, including players or creatures.

But Alice wants to kill Orim to remove the threat.

If she targets Bob, for example, but that might not help kill Orim.

Let's think.

Suppose Alice casts Kindle targeting Bob. With X=2, deals 2 damage to Bob.

But Bob might not care, and Orim is still there.

Then Alice has one Kindle left, which she can use on Orim, but Bob can prevent with Orim.

Not efficient.

Alice needs to deal with Orim first.

Back to the sequence.

From Bob's perspective, if Alice casts a Kindle targeting Orim, and Bob prevents it, then Alice can kill with the second Kindle since Orim is tapped.

If Bob doesn't prevent, Alice casts second Kindle, Bob prevents that, Orim lives with 2 damage.

So Bob should not prevent the first Kindle to have a chance to prevent the second.

Thus, in optimal play, Bob will not activate Orim for the first Kindle.

Then, after first Kindle resolves, Orim has 2 damage.

Alice casts second Kindle for 3 damage.

Bob activates Orim to prevent 3 damage, so no damage, Orim survives with 2 damage.

Alice cannot kill Orim with this.

But is there a way for Alice to force the kill?

What if Alice, after the first Kindle resolves and Orim has 2 damage, she doesn't cast the second Kindle immediately. Instead, she passes the turn or something.

But on her turn, she can cast instants anytime.

Suppose after Kindle 1 deals 2 damage to Orim, Alice does nothing. Bob's turn starts, but Bob can untap Orim during his untap step, and then Orim is ready again.

During Alice's turn, after Kindle 1 resolved, Orim has 2 damage, untapped.

If Alice passes to the next phase, say to combat, but no combat, or to end step.

Bob can still activate Orim at any time he has priority.

If Alice doesn't cast Kindle 2, and passes turn, during Bob's upkeep or something, Bob can activate Orim to prevent damage, but there's no damage to prevent yet.

The prevention is for the turn, so if Bob activates Orim during Alice's turn, the prevention lasts until end of turn.

But if Alice doesn't cast Kindle 2, the prevention might be wasted.

But in this case, Alice wants to cast Kindle 2 to kill Orim.

Perhaps Alice can wait until Bob's turn to cast Kindle 2, but on Bob's turn, Orim can still be activated.

Let's think about timing.

Suppose during Alice's turn, after Kindle 1 resolved, Orim has 2 damage.

Alice passes to combat phase, no attacks, then to second main phase, still no action, then to end step.

In end step, Alice can cast Kindle 2 targeting Orim.

Then Bob can activate Orim in response to prevent the 3 damage.

Same as before.

If Alice casts Kindle 2 during Bob's turn.

Say, during Bob's upkeep, Alice casts Kindle 2 targeting Orim.

Bob can activate Orim in response to prevent the damage.

Or if Bob doesn't, Kindle 2 deals 3 damage, Orim has 2+3=5, dead, but Bob will activate to prevent.

So no difference.

The key point is that as long as Orim is untapped, Bob can prevent damage from a Kindle spell.

The only way for Alice to kill Orim is to force Orim to be tapped when the damaging spell resolves.

In the case where Bob prevents the first Kindle, Orim is tapped, and second Kindle kills it.

But Bob won't prevent the first Kindle; he will let it resolve to save the prevention for the second.

So Alice needs to trick Bob into tapping Orim early or something.

But Bob plays optimally.

Another idea: Alice could cast Kindle targeting herself or something, but that seems pointless.

Or target Bob, but same issue.

Suppose Alice casts Kindle targeting Bob.

With X=2, deals 2 to Bob.

Bob might activate Orim to prevent that damage, but Orim's ability can prevent damage to any target, so Bob could prevent the damage to himself by tapping Orim.

Then Orim is tapped.

Then Alice can cast the second Kindle targeting Orim for 3 damage (since one Kindle in graveyard), and since Orim is tapped, no prevention, Orim dies.

Is that possible?

Let's see.

Alice casts Kindle 1 targeting Bob.

Stack: Kindle 1 targeting Bob.

Bob has priority. He can activate Orim's ability to prevent the next 3 damage to Bob or to any target. He can choose to prevent damage to Bob.

If he activates Orim, taps it, ability on stack.

Ability resolves: prevent next 3 damage to any target this turn. Bob might set it to prevent damage to himself.

Then Kindle 1 resolves: deals 2 damage to Bob, but prevented, so no damage. Kindle 1 to graveyard.

Now, Orim is tapped.

Alice casts Kindle 2 targeting Orim. With one Kindle in graveyard, X=3, deals 3 damage to Orim. Orim tapped, cannot activate, so destroyed.

If Bob does not activate Orim when Kindle 1 targets Bob, then Kindle 1 deals 2 damage to Bob, Kindle to graveyard.

Then Alice casts Kindle 2 targeting Orim for 3 damage.

Bob can activate Orim to prevent the 3 damage to Orim, so Orim lives, and Bob has 2 damage.

But Bob might prefer to take the damage and save Orim, since Orim is more valuable.

In this case, if Bob prevents the damage to himself, he loses Orim; if he doesn't, he takes 2 damage but keeps Orim.

Since Alice wants to kill Orim, for her, if she can force Bob to choose between taking damage or losing Orim, but Bob might choose to take damage to keep Orim.

In the first subcase, if Bob prevents damage to himself, he loses Orim.

If he doesn't prevent, he takes 2 damage but keeps Orim.

So Bob, to keep Orim alive, should not prevent the damage to himself when Kindle targets him.

Then Alice gains nothing; she dealt 2 damage to Bob but Orim is still alive, and she has one Kindle left which can be prevented.

Not better for Alice.

But in the scenario where Alice targets Bob first, and Bob prevents, then Alice can kill Orim with second Kindle.

But Bob, knowing this, might choose not to prevent, take the 2 damage, and keep Orim untapped for the second Kindle.

So for Bob, the optimal is to not prevent when targeted at himself, to save Orim.

Similarly, if Alice targets Orim first, Bob doesn't prevent, takes 2 damage to Orim, then prevents the second Kindle.

So in both cases, Bob can save Orim.

But Alice has two Kindles; she needs to use both.

Perhaps Alice can cast the first Kindle targeting Orim, and if Bob doesn't prevent, she doesn't cast the second yet, but she has to eventually.

I think I'm stuck.

Another thought: Alice can cast Kindle with X=2 targeting Orim. If Bob prevents, then second Kindle kills. If not, Orim has 2 damage.

Then, instead of casting second Kindle, Alice can... but she has no other actions.

Unless she casts the second Kindle at a time when Bob can't respond, but he can always respond with Orim's ability since it's instant speed.

Orim's ability can be activated any time, as long as Orim is untapped.

The only way is to have Orim tapped when the damage spell resolves.

So Alice needs to cast a spell that forces Bob to tap Orim, then cast the Kindle when Orim is tapped.

But with only two Kindles, it's tricky.

In the targeting Bob case, if Bob taps Orim to prevent, then Alice can kill Orim.

But Bob won't tap Orim if targeted at Bob; he'll take the damage.

Similarly, if targeted at Orim, he won't tap for the first.

So Alice cannot force Bob to tap Orim prematurely.

Perhaps Alice can cast both Kindles targeting different things.

For example, cast first Kindle targeting Orim.

If Bob prevents, then second Kindle kills Orim.

If not, Kindle 1 deals 2 damage to Orim.

Then Alice casts second Kindle targeting Bob for 3 damage (since one Kindle in graveyard).

Then Bob can activate Orim to prevent the 3 damage to Bob, tapping Orim.

So Orim is tapped, Bob takes no damage, Orim has 2 damage and is tapped.

Alice has no more spells, Orim survives with 2 damage.

If Bob doesn't prevent the second Kindle targeting Bob, he takes 3 damage, but Orim still has 2 damage, so not destroyed.

But Bob can prevent to avoid damage.

So Orim lives.

Not helpful.

Alice might cast the second Kindle on Orim, but as before.

I think in all cases, with optimal play from Bob, Orim survives with 2 damage.

But let's confirm the initial approach.

Alice casts Kindle 1 at Orim.

Bob does not prevent (optimal), Kindle 1 deals 2 damage to Orim.

Alice casts Kindle 2 at Orim for 3 damage.

Bob activates Orim, prevents 3 damage.

Orim has 2 damage, survives.

Alice cannot kill Orim.

If Alice does nothing after first Kindle, Orim has 2 damage, and during Bob's turn, he can untap Orim, and the damage stays until end of turn? No, damage is removed at the end of the turn.

Important rule: damage marked on a creature is removed at the end of each turn.

So if during Alice's turn, Kindle 1 deals 2 damage to Orim, that damage is marked until the end of Alice's turn.

At the end of Alice's turn, the damage is removed, and Orim is back to 3 toughness.

Then on Bob's turn, Orim is fine.

So if Alice doesn't cast the second Kindle during her turn, the damage from first Kindle is gone, and she wasted it.

She must cast the second Kindle during her turn to have a chance.

But as above, Bob prevents it.

So Alice cannot kill Orim with two Kindles if Bob plays optimally.

But that seems odd; perhaps there is a way.

Another idea: Alice can cast Kindle 1 targeting Orim. If Bob prevents, then Kindle 2 kills. If not, Kindle 1 deals 2 damage.

Then, with Orim at 2 damage, Alice can cast Kindle 2 targeting Orim, but before it resolves, or something.

But Bob can respond to the cast.

Unless Alice can make Kindle 2 deal more damage.

But Kindle's X is determined on resolution, not on cast.

When Kindle resolves, it checks the number of Kindles in graveyards.

In the sequence where Kindle 1 resolved and in graveyard, Kindle 2 deals 3.

But Bob prevents it.

Perhaps Alice can cast Kindle 2 first.

But similar.

I think I have to conclude that with optimal play, Orim survives.

But let's see the title: "optimal play for both players" and "explain the outcome".

Perhaps for Alice, the best is to cast both at once or something.

Earlier when both cast at once and Bob prevents, Orim takes 2 damage and lives.

If Alice casts Kindle 1, and Bob doesn't prevent, then she casts Kindle 2, Bob prevents, Orim lives with 2.

Same thing.

If Alice casts Kindle 1, Bob prevents, then she casts Kindle 2, Orim dies.

But Bob won't prevent the first.

So only if Bob misplays, Orim dies.

But with optimal play, Bob doesn't prevent first, so Orim lives.

For Alice, she might as well cast the spells, and if Bob prevents the first, she kills with second; if not, she casts second and hopes, but Bob prevents.

But in any case, with optimal Bob, Orim lives.

Perhaps Alice can not cast any Kindle and pass, but that doesn't help.

Or she can cast Kindle on herself, but that's silly.

I think Alice cannot kill Orim with two Kindles if Bob plays optimally.

But let's double-check the Kindle ability.

"Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards."

And Orim: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."

The prevention is for the next 3 damage, not per target or per source.

So it can prevent multiple instances.

In the both-at-once case, it prevented 2 from one and 1 from the other.

But Orim still lived.

Another thought: Alice can cast Kindle targeting Orim, and if Bob prevents, fine, then second Kindle kills.

If Bob doesn't prevent, Kindle deals 2 damage, then Alice can cast the second Kindle targeting Orim, but before it resolves, she can... nothing.

Or, she can let the first Kindle resolve, Orim at 2 damage, then she casts the second Kindle, but in response, Bob activates Orim, but Alice can respond to that activation.

Let's see the stack.

After Kindle 1 resolved, Orim has 2 damage.

Alice casts Kindle 2 targeting Orim. Stack: Kindle 2 on top.

Bob activates Orim's ability in response. Ability on stack above Kindle 2.

Now, Alice has priority. Can she do anything? She has no other cards, so she passes.

Ability resolves: prevent next 3 damage this turn.

Then Kindle 2 resolves: deals 3 damage to Orim, but prevented, so no damage.

Orim still at 2 damage.

If Alice could counter the ability or something, but she has no cards.

So no.

Perhaps Alice can cast Kindle 2 in response to Bob's activation, but that might not help.

Suppose when Alice casts Kindle 2, and Bob activates Orim in response, the ability is on stack.

Alice could cast another spell, but she has no other spells.

So I think it's impossible for Alice to kill Orim with two Kindles if Bob plays optimally.

But that can't be right; perhaps I missed something.

Let's read the problem again.

"Alice has (only) two cards in her hand, specifically two copies of 'Kindle'."

"Bob has no cards in hand, but has a Orim, Samite Healer in play, untapped."

"Orim has been on board for a while (unaffected by summoning sickness)."

"Alice has sufficient mana."

"Bob's lands are tapped out."

So Bob can only use Orim's ability once, since it taps Orim.

Orim's ability taps it, so he can use it only once per turn, since it doesn't untap immediately.

In the sequences, Bob uses it once.

In the case where he uses it on the second Kindle, Orim lives.

If he uses it on the first, he dies.

So he doesn't use it on the first.

For Alice, she might be able to force him to use it.

But how?

Perhaps by targeting different things.

Suppose Alice casts Kindle 1 targeting Bob.

Bob, to save himself, might prevent the damage by tapping Orim.

Then Orim is tapped, and Alice casts Kindle 2 on Orim for 3 damage, kills it.

But Bob might not prevent the damage to himself; he might take 2 damage to keep Orim untapped.

Since he has no cards, and Orim can prevent future damage, he might prefer to take the damage.

But 2 damage is not much, so he might take it.

In that case, Alice deals 2 to Bob, then casts Kindle 2 on Orim, Bob prevents, Orim lives.

If Bob prevents the damage to himself, he loses Orim.

So for Bob, the choice is: take 2 damage and keep Orim, or prevent damage and lose Orim.

Which is better for Bob?

The problem doesn't specify life totals or other factors, so we have to assume that keeping Orim alive is important, as it's a threat to Alice's burn deck.

Bob might value Orim more than 2 life.

So he might choose to take the damage.

In that case, Alice cannot force him to tap Orim.

Similarly, if Alice targets Orim first, same thing.

I think Alice cannot kill Orim with two Kindles.

But let's assume that Bob will prevent damage to himself if targeted, to save life.

Then Alice can kill Orim by targeting Bob first.

But that depends on Bob's preference.

The problem says "optimal play for both players", so we need to define what optimal means.

For Alice, optimal is to kill Orim if possible.

For Bob, optimal is to keep Orim alive if possible.

In this case, Bob can keep Orim alive by taking damage to himself or by not preventing the first Kindle on Orim.

So for consistency, let's say Bob wants to keep Orim alive and minimize damage to himself.

In the targeting Orim case: if he doesn't prevent first Kindle, Orim takes 2 damage, then he prevents second, Orim lives with 2 damage, no damage to Bob.

If he prevents first, Orim dies, and he takes no damage from that, but loses Orim.

So he prefers not to prevent first.

In targeting Bob case: if Alice targets Bob with Kindle 1, if Bob prevents, he takes no damage but loses Orim. If he doesn't prevent, he takes 2 damage but keeps Orim.

So to keep Orim, he doesn't prevent, takes 2 damage.

Then Alice casts Kindle 2 on Orim, Bob prevents, Orim lives.

So in both cases, Orim lives, but in one case Bob takes 2 damage, in the other not.

Bob prefers not to take damage, so he would rather have the targeting Orim scenario where he takes no damage and Orim lives with 2 damage.

For Alice, she can choose to target Orim first to avoid giving Bob free damage.

But still, Orim lives.

Perhaps the outcome is that Orim survives with 2 damage.

But let's see if Alice can do better with the both-at-once cast.

Earlier: Alice casts Kindle 1 and Kindle 2 in sequence holding priority.

Stack: Kindle 2 on top, Kindle 1 below.

Bob can activate Orim in response to Kindle 2.

Ability on stack.

Ability resolves: prevent next 3 damage.

Then Kindle 2 resolves: deals 2 damage (no Kindles in graveyard), prevented, so 2 prevented, shield has 1 left.

Kindle 2 to graveyard.

Then Kindle 1 resolves: deals 3 damage (one Kindle in graveyard), prevention shield prevents 1, so 2 damage dealt to Orim.

Orim has 2 damage, survives.

If Bob does nothing, Kindle 2 deals 2, Kindle 1 deals 3, total 5, dead, but Bob will activate.

So same.

I think it's impossible.

Perhaps Alice can cast one Kindle, let it resolve if Bob doesn't prevent, then with Orim at 2 damage, she can pass to end step, and in end step cast Kindle 2.

But in end step, Bob can still prevent.

Damage is removed at end of turn, so if she casts in end step, the damage from first Kindle is still there until end of turn.

The end step is part of the turn, so damage is removed during the cleanup step, which is after the end step.

Let's clarify the turn structure.

Untap, upkeep, draw, main phase, combat, second main phase, end step, cleanup.

Damage is removed during cleanup step.

During end step, players can cast instants.

If during Alice's end step, she casts Kindle 2 targeting Orim, who has 2 damage from earlier.

Bob can activate Orim in response to prevent the 3 damage.

Then Kindle 2 deals 0 damage, Orim has 2 damage.

Then cleanup, damage removed, Orim fine.

If Bob doesn't prevent, Kindle 2 deals 3 damage, Orim has 5, dead, but he will prevent.

So no.

I think I have to accept that with two Kindles, Alice cannot kill Orim if Bob plays optimally.

But that seems anti-climactic.

Perhaps Kindle's damage is determined on cast or something, but no, it's on resolution.

Another idea: Alice can cast Kindle targeting Orim, and if Bob prevents, fine, second Kindle kills.

If Bob doesn't prevent, Kindle deals 2 damage, then Alice can cast the second Kindle targeting the same Orim, but with the damage already, it would be lethal if not prevented, but it is prevented.

Or, she can cast it targeting something else, but no.

I think I'm out of options.

Perhaps Orim's ability can be used only once, but Alice can deal more than 3 damage at once.

With two Kindles, the most she can deal at once is 3, if one is in graveyard, but to have one in graveyard, she needs to cast one first, which might be prevented or not.

If she casts both at once, as above, they deal 2 and 3 separately, not at once.

Damage is dealt separately for each spell.

So the prevention can block parts.

I think Bob can always prevent the lethal damage.

So for optimal play:

Alice should cast the first Kindle targeting Orim.

Bob, optimally, does not activate Orim, so Kindle deals 2 damage to Orim.

Then Alice casts the second Kindle targeting Orim.

Bob activates Orim to prevent the 3 damage.

Orim survives with 2 damage.

Outcome: Orim has 2 damage marked, but since damage is removed at end of turn, at the end of Alice's turn, during cleanup, the damage is removed, so Orim is back to full.

The damage is marked until end of turn, then removed.

So after all, Orim is unharmed.

In the sequence, after second Kindle is prevented, Orim has 2 damage from first Kindle.

Then when Alice's turn ends, during cleanup, the damage is removed from Orim.

So Orim is fine.

Similarly in all cases.

So with optimal play, Orim survives with no damage, and Alice has used both Kindles with no effect on Orim.

Alice dealt no damage to Orim, and Bob took no damage.

But Alice wasted two cards.

But she couldn't do better.

Perhaps Alice should not cast any spells and save the Kindles for later, but the problem says she wants to kill Orim now, and with Orim untapped, it's hard.

Later, if Bob untaps, he can use Orim again.

But on Alice's turn, she has to act.

I think for Alice, the optimal is to do nothing and wait for a better opportunity, but with no other cards, it might not come.

The problem assumes she wants to kill Orim now.

So perhaps the outcome is that Alice cannot kill Orim with the two Kindles.

But let's confirm with a different approach.

Suppose Alice casts Kindle 1 targeting Orim.

Bob must choose to activate or not.

If he activates, he taps Orim, prevents damage, Kindle to graveyard.

Then Alice casts Kindle 2, 3 damage, Orim tapped, dead.

Bob loses Orim.

If he does not activate, Kindle 1 deals 2 damage to Orim.

Then Alice casts Kindle 2, 3 damage, Bob activates Orim, prevents damage, Orim has 2 damage, lives, and damage removed later.

So for Bob, not activating for the first Kindle is better, as it saves Orim.

So he chooses not to activate.

Then Alice is forced to deal 2 damage and have the second prevented.

So Orim survives.

I think that's the answer.

For the optimal play:

Alice casts first Kindle targeting Orim.

Bob does not activate Orim, so it deals 2 damage to Orim.

Alice casts second Kindle targeting Orim.

Bob activates Orim to prevent the 3 damage.

Outcome: Orim has 2 damage marked, but at end of turn, it is removed, so Orim survives unharmed. Alice has no cards in hand.

Bob's Orim is still in play.

Thought process:

Alice wants to kill Orim. She has two Kindles. Kindle deals more damage if there are Kindles in graveyard, but initially 2.

Orim can prevent 3 damage by tapping.

If Alice casts one Kindle, Bob can prevent it by tapping, but then Orim is tapped, and second Kindle deals 3 damage, killing it.

To avoid that, Bob should not prevent the first Kindle, letting it deal 2 damage. Then when Alice casts the second Kindle for 3 damage, Bob prevents it by tapping Orim, so Orim survives with 2 damage, which is not lethal and is removed at end of turn.
