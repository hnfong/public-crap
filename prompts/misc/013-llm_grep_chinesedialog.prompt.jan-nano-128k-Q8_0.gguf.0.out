Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to perform a semantic grep on the given input, specifically looking for lines that contain dialog or spoken text. The key here is to identify lines that clearly have dialogue, not just any mention of sounds or actions.

First, I'll go through each line one by one. Line 1 is a title, probably not dialogue. Line 4 has 「轟隆！」 which is a sound effect, not dialogue. Line 7 is a description of the sky, not dialogue. Line 8 has 「啊～！」 and then a dialogue line 「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」 So that's definitely dialogue. Line 27 has 「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」 which is a dialogue. Line 29 has 「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」 also dialogue. Line 33 has 「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 which is a dialogue. Line 43 has 「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」 and then line 45 has 「？？？」 which is a reaction, maybe dialogue. Line 47 has 「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」 which is dialogue. 

Wait, line 45 is 「？？？」, that's a sound effect or a reaction, but maybe it's considered spoken text. The user said "dialog or spoken text", so maybe that's included. Also, line 44 is empty, so no. Line 45 is a reaction, but maybe it's part of the dialogue. Let me check again. The query is for lines with dialog or spoken text. So any line that has a character speaking or reacting would count. 

So lines 8, 27, 29, 33, 43, 45, 47. Let me verify each line again. Line 8: the character is speaking, so yes. Line 27: the character is speaking. Line 29: the black衣人 is speaking. Line 33: the speaker is asking a question. Line 43: the speaker is talking. Line 45: the character is confused, so that's a spoken reaction. Line 47: the speaker is responding. 

I need to make sure that these are the only ones. Line 44 is empty, so no. Line 45 is a reaction, so yes. Line 47 is dialogue. The rest of the lines are descriptions or sound effects. So the answer should include those lines with their numbers.
