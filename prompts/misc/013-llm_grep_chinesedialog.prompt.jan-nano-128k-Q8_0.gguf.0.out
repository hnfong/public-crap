Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to perform a semantic grep on the given input, specifically looking for lines that contain dialog or spoken text. The key here is to identify lines that clearly have dialogue, not just any mention of sounds or actions that might be tangentially related.

First, I'll go through each line of the input one by one. Line 1 is a title, probably not dialogue. Line 2 and 3 are empty, so no. Line 4 has 「轟隆！」 which is a sound, maybe thunder, but not dialogue. Line 5 is a description of the sky, not dialogue. Line 6 is another sound, but again, not dialogue. Line 7 is a description of the sky again. Line 8 has 「啊～！」 which is a spoken exclamation, so that's dialogue. Then line 9 is a description of the environment. Line 10 is another sound, but not dialogue. Line 11 is a description of the sky. Line 12 is a sound again. Line 13 is a description of the rain. Line 14 is a description of the rain. Line 15 is empty. Line 16 is empty. Line 17 is empty. Line 18 is empty. Line 19 is a description of someone being on the roof. Line 20 is empty. Line 21 is a description of the roof. Line 22 is a sound, but not dialogue. Line 23 is a description of the action. Line 24 is a description of the action. Line 25 is a description of the action. Line 26 is a dialogue line: 「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」 Line 27 is a description of the black-robed person's voice. Line 28 is a dialogue line: 「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」 Line 29 is a description of the person's voice. Line 30 is a description of the action. Line 31 is empty. Line 32 is empty. Line 33 is a description of the action. Line 34 is a description of the action. Line 35 is a description of the rain stopping. Line 36 is a description of the sword. Line 37 is a description of the sword. Line 38 is a dialogue line: 「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 Line 39 is a description of the black-robed person's reaction. Line 40 is a dialogue line: 「！！！」 which is an exclamation. Line 41 is a description of the black-robed person's face. Line 42 is a dialogue line: 「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」 Line 43 is a description of the black-robed person's confusion. Line 44 is a description of the action. Line 45 is empty. Line 46 is a description of the action. Line 47 is a description of the action. Line 48 is a description of the action. Line 49 is a description of the action. Line 50 is a description of the action. Line 51 is empty. Line 52 is the end tag.

So, the lines that have clear spoken dialogues are lines 8, 26, 28, 38, 40, 42. Wait, line 26 is a dialogue line, line 28 is a dialogue line, line 38 is a dialogue line, line 40 is an exclamation, line 42 is a dialogue line. Also, line 40 is 「！！！」 which is a spoken reaction. Line 42 is a dialogue line. Let me check again. Line 8: 「啊～！」 is a spoken exclamation. Line 26: 「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」 is dialogue. Line 28: 「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」 is dialogue. Line 38: 「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 is dialogue. Line 40: 「！！！」 is an exclamation, but it's part of the dialogue. Line 42: 「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」 is dialogue. So those lines should be included. The others are either descriptions or sounds not directly dialogue. So the answer should list those lines with their numbers.

8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」
