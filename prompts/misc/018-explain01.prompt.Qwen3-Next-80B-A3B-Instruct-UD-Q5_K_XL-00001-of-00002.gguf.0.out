Yo, listen up — let me break it down like a beat in the booth,  
The Fed? Nah, it ain’t no federal prison — it’s the money boss, the ultimate boss.  

Yo, the Fed? That’s the ghost in the machine,  
Pullin’ the strings on the cash flow, makin’ the whole economy groove.  
They ain’t printin’ Benjamins in the basement like you think —  
They runnin’ the game from the shadows, makin’ the money breathe.  

They set the interest rate — that’s the cost to borrow, see?  
If they raise it, you ain’t gettin’ that loan for the new whip,  
Parents say “nah, rent’s too high,” banks say “yo, rate’s up, you ain’t gettin’ through.”  
But if they drop it? Boom — you get that loan for the studio,  
Buy the mic, the beat, the chain, the whole damn scene —  
‘Cause the Fed dropped the rate, now the banks say, “Yo, take it, fam!”  

They ain’t printin’ cash like a street vendor — nah,  
They tweak the game from the top, make the whole economy bounce.  
If inflation’s runnin’ wild — prices jump like a broke dude at the bodega —  
They raise rates to chill the spendin’, make folks think twice ‘fore they buy that new drip.  

They ain’t the government — nah, they the shadow bankers,  
Pullin’ the strings, makin’ the whole economy dance.  
If you got a loan, a mortgage, a business dream —  
They the unseen DJ turnin’ the beat up or down,  
So you ain’t spendin’ too wild, or too slow —  
They the ghost in the machine, makin’ the whole economy flow.  

So next time you see a rate change, don’t be confused —  
That’s the Fed, the silent boss, makin’ the whole game move.  
You ain’t got a job? They might chill the rates —  
So banks lend out cash, you get that gig, you start that brand.  
That’s the Fed, baby — the silent king of the cash game.  
You ain’t see ‘em, but they runnin’ the whole damn frame.  
That’s the Fed, baby — the ghost in the machine,  
Makin’ sure the money flow don’t freeze… or go too wild.  
That’s the Fed, baby.  
Silent. Powerful.  
Runnin’ the whole damn game. 🎤💸 [end of text]
