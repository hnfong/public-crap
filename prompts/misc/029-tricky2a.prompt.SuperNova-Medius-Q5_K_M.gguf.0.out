Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Alice is correct in stating that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, not -10 degrees Celsius. At -10 degrees Celsius, water remains in its liquid state unless it has already started to freeze and is continuing to freeze. Bob's statement that "It freezes" is not accurate in the context of the specific temperature mentioned (-10 degrees Celsius), as it does not specify that the water must first be at or above its freezing point (0 degrees Celsius) to begin the freezing process. Therefore, Bob's response is misleading without the necessary context. 

In summary, Alice is right about the freezing point of water, and Bob's statement is not precise in the context of the question. [end of text]
