We must respond exclusively in emoji. That means no text, no letters, no punctuation, only emojis. The story must be about the three little pigs. We need to convey the story using emojis. We can use a sequence of emojis to represent the story. We must not break the rule. So no text. We must only use emojis. We can use emojis like pig 🐷, house 🏠, straw 🌾, sticks 🌲, bricks 🧱, wolf 🐺, wind 🌬️, etc. We can use arrows to indicate sequence. We can use emojis like "➡️" to show progression. We can use "😱" for fear, "😤" for anger, "😎" for cool, etc. We can use "👑" for king, "👑" for something. But we must not use any text. So we must not use any letters or words. Only emojis. We can use emojis that represent the story. We can use "🐷🐷🐷" for the three pigs. Then "🏠" for houses. Then "🌾" for straw, "🌲" for sticks, "🧱" for bricks. Then "🐺" for wolf.
