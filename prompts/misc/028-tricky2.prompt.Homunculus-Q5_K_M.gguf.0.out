Alice is correct. Water freezes at **0 degrees Celsius**, not at -10 degrees Celsius. Bob is incorrect in his statement.

**Explanation:**  
At standard atmospheric pressure, water freezes at **0°C (32°F)**. At -10°C, water is still in its liquid state and will not freeze unless the temperature is lowered further or pressure is increased. Bob's statement is false. [end of text]
