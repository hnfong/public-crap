Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Okay, so Alice and Bob are arguing about whether water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that the standard freezing point of water is 0°C. That's when water turns to ice under normal atmospheric pressure. So Alice is correct in saying that water freezes at 0°C. But Bob says "It freezes" at -10°C, and then when Alice corrects him, he still claims he's right. How could that be?

Hmm, maybe there's something about supercooling? I remember that water can sometimes stay liquid below 0°C if there's nothing for the ice crystals to form around, like in a very clean container. But supercooling usually doesn't go much below -10°C, right? Wait, actually, supercooled water can exist down to around -40°C, but that's under specific conditions. But even then, it's still liquid until it's disturbed. So if Bob is talking about supercooled water at -10°C, it's still liquid, so he's wrong. 

Alternatively, maybe Bob is referring to something else, like impurities in the water? If water has impurities, like salt, the freezing point drops. But that's for solutions, not pure water. So if the question is about pure water, then Bob is wrong. But if it's about seawater or something with salt, maybe? Seawater freezes around -2°C, so still not -10. 

Wait, maybe Bob is thinking of ice at -10°C? Like, once it's frozen, it stays frozen. So if water is already frozen, then at -10°C it would remain ice. But the question is about what happens to water (liquid) at -10°C. So if it's already below 0, then it should be ice. But if it's supercooled, it might still be liquid. 

Alternatively, maybe Bob is using a different context, like high pressure? But I think high pressure actually lowers the freezing point a bit, but not sure. Wait, no, actually, the phase diagram of water shows that under high pressure, the freezing point can decrease, but I'm not sure about the exact numbers. 

Alternatively, maybe Bob is considering that once water is frozen, it stays frozen below 0°C. So if you have ice at -10°C, it's still ice. But the question is about what happens to water (liquid) at that temperature. So if you take liquid water and cool it to -10°C, it would freeze, but only if it can form ice crystals. But in reality, it might supercool. 

Wait, the key here is the wording. Alice says "What happens to water at -10°C?" Bob says "It freezes." Alice corrects the temperature, but Bob says he's still right. Maybe Bob is right in a different sense. Like, if the water is already at -10°C, then it must already be frozen, so it's ice. So if you have water at that temperature, it can't be liquid; it would have frozen. But in reality, supercooled water can exist below 0, but not indefinitely. So maybe in normal conditions, water at -10°C is ice, so Bob is right in that sense. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a trick. The standard freezing point is 0°C, but if you have water at -10°C, it's already frozen, so the state is ice. Therefore, the answer is that Bob is correct because at -10°C, water is in the solid state (ice), so it has already frozen. Alice is correct that the freezing occurs at 0°C, but once it's below that, it's ice. So Bob's statement is technically correct because at -10°C, water is frozen. 

So the confusion is between the process of freezing (which happens at 0°C) versus the state at a lower temperature. So Bob is right in that at -10°C, water is ice, so it has frozen. Alice is right about the temperature at which freezing occurs. Therefore, both are correct in their own contexts. But the question is who is right in the argument. Since Alice corrected the temperature, but Bob says he's still right, the answer is that Bob is correct because at -10°C, water is in the solid state (frozen), so his statement holds. The process starts at 0, but the result is that below 0, it's ice. So the answer is Bob is right because at -10°C, water is already frozen.

Bob is correct. While water freezes at 0°C, once it reaches that temperature, it becomes ice. At -10°C, water (if it exists in liquid form there) would already have frozen. However, pure water can sometimes supercool below 0°C without freezing, but this is unstable. Under normal conditions, water at -10°C is solid ice, so Bob’s statement holds: "It freezes" (i.e., it is frozen) at that temperature. Alice is correct about the freezing point, but Bob’s answer is valid in the context of the state of water at -10°C. 

**Answer:** Bob is right. At -10°C, water is already in its solid state (ice), so it has frozen. While the freezing process occurs at 0°C, the question asks about the state at -10°C, which is ice. [end of text]
