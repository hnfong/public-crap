Okay, so Alice and Bob are arguing about the freezing point of water. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the question is about what happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius. Alice says water freezes at 0°C, so Bob must be wrong. But Bob claims he's still right. Hmm, why would he say that?

Well, the standard freezing point of water is indeed 0°C under standard atmospheric pressure. So at exactly 0°C, water can be in a solid, liquid, or gas state depending on conditions. But if the temperature drops below 0°C, like to -10°C, then water should be frozen, right? Because once it's below the freezing point, it turns to ice. 

Wait, but maybe there's a nuance here. Like supercooled water? I remember that water can sometimes remain liquid below 0°C if there's no nucleation sites for ice crystals to form. But that's an exception and typically in a pure environment or under certain conditions. In most everyday situations, water would freeze by the time it reaches -10°C. 

So Bob's answer "It freezes" is correct in the general case. Even though the freezing point is 0°C, once it's cooled below that, it's already frozen. So when Alice says Bob is wrong because freezing happens at 0°C, she's correct about the freezing point, but Bob is also correct that at -10°C, the water would be in a frozen state. 

Therefore, both have a point. But the question is specifically about what happens at -10°C. Since at that temperature, water is solid ice, Bob is right in stating that it freezes. However, the process of freezing occurs at 0°C, so Alice is correct about the temperature at which freezing occurs. But the state at -10°C is indeed ice, so Bob's answer is accurate for the given temperature. 

So the answer is that both are technically correct, but in different aspects. However, the direct question is about the state at -10°C, so Bob is right in that context.

Bob is right in the context of the question. Here's why:

- **Freezing point**: Water freezes at **0°C** under standard pressure (Alice is correct here).  
- **State at -10°C**: Below 0°C, water exists as **ice**. Thus, at -10°C, water is already frozen (Bob’s answer holds).  

Alice is correct about the *transition temperature*, but Bob is correct about the *state at -10°C*. Since the question asks what happens *at -10°C*, Bob’s answer is valid. [end of text]
