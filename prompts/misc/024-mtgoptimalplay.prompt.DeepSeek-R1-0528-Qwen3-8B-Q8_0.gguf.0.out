<think>
First, Alice has two 'Kindle' cards in her hand. 'Kindle' is an instant that deals 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards damage to any target. So, if she casts one Kindle, it deals 2 damage because there's one in the graveyard (since Bob has one in play, I assume it's in the graveyard when not in play? No, let's clarify the game state.

The problem says: "Alice has (only) two cards in her hand, specifically two copies of 'Kindle'." And "Bob has a Orim, Samite Healer in play, untapped." Also, "Orim is a threat to Alice's burn deck, so she wants to kill Orim." And "Bob's lands are tapped out," meaning Bob has no mana sources to tap, so he can't cast spells or activate creatures unless he has untapped lands or other abilities.

Now, 'Kindle' deals damage based on the number of Kindles in graveyards. Graveyards are where cards go when they die or are discarded, etc. But Orim is in play, not in the graveyard, so initially, there might be no Kindles in graveyards unless Bob has cast some or something.

Let's read carefully: "Alice has two copies of 'Kindle' in her hand." So, Kindles are in hand, not in graveyards. When Alice casts a Kindle, it goes to the battlefield, and then it can go to the graveyard if it dies or is used.

But the damage is based on the number in graveyards, not on the battlefield. The ability says: "deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards."

So, for the first Kindle cast, if there are no other Kindles in graveyards, X = 2 + 0 = 2, so it deals 2 damage.

But Alice has two Kindles, so if she casts one, it deals 2 damage to Orim. Orim has toughness 3, so 2 damage is not enough to kill it unless it's already damaged or something.

The problem doesn't specify the current damage on Orim. I think we need to assume that Orim is at full health, so 0 damage.

Also, Bob has Orim untapped, so he can activate its ability if needed.

Alice wants to kill Orim, so she needs to deal at least 3 damage to it.

With one Kindle, she deals 2 damage, which is not enough.

She has two Kindles, so she can cast both.

But when she casts the second Kindle, what is X?

X is 2 plus the number of Kindles in graveyards.

Initially, no Kindles in graveyards.

After casting the first Kindle, it's on the battlefield, not in graveyard.

Then she casts the second Kindle, it goes to battlefield, and now X is 2 plus the number in graveyards, which is still 0, so it deals 2 damage again.

But Orim has 3 toughness, so two 2-damage instants might not be enough if they don't all hit Orim or if there's damage prevention.

The ability allows targeting any target, so Alice can target Orim with both Kindles.

But each Kindle deals 2 damage separately, I think.

Let's confirm the timing.

Alice casts first Kindle: deals 2 damage to Orim. Orim now has 1 damage.

Then, on the same turn, Alice casts second Kindle: since no Kindles in graveyards yet, it deals another 2 damage to Orim, so Orim has 3 damage, which should kill it if it's a 3-toughness creature.

But Orim has an ability: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."

And it's untapped, so Bob can tap it to prevent damage.

The problem says: "Orim has been on board for a while (unaffected by summoning sickness)." So Orim is already tapped, I think? "unaffected by summoning sickness" might mean that it's not affected by the summoning sickness rule, but since it's a creature with tap ability, summoning sickness typically prevents creatures from being tapped unless they have activated abilities, but Orim's ability is a tap ability, which is activated by tapping it.

Let's clarify summoning sickness.

In Magic, summoning sickness prevents a creature from attacking or using its activated abilities on the turn it was summoned, unless it has haste. But Orim was already on the board, so it was summoned earlier, so no summoning sickness applies. And it's untapped, meaning it can be tapped.

The ability is "Tap: Prevent...", so Bob can tap Orim to activate the prevention.

Now, Alice is casting instants, so the order matters.

Alice wants to kill Orim, so she needs to deal damage before Bob can prevent it or something.

But Bob can respond to the instants.

Let's think step by step.

First, Alice has two Kindles in hand. She can cast them as instants.

Bob has Orim, which is a creature with an activated ability: Tap to prevent the next 3 damage this turn.

Also, Bob has no cards in hand, and lands are tapped out, so he has no other sources of mana unless he draws or something, but we're only considering this turn, I assume.

The question is about optimal play for both players in this situation, and Alice wants to kill Orim.

Alice's goal is to deal at least 3 damage to Orim before the prevention can be activated.

But the prevention is activated by tapping Orim, which Bob can do at any time when he has the ability to tap it.

Since Orim is untapped, Bob can tap it in response to Alice's actions.

Now, 'Kindle' is an instant, so it can be cast at any time, and it deals damage immediately.

The damage from Kindle is dealt when the spell resolves, and the prevention ability can be used to prevent that damage.

Let's think about the sequence.

Suppose Alice casts one Kindle.

When she casts it, it's an instant, so it resolves immediately, dealing 2 damage to Orim (since no Kindles in graveyards).

Now, Orim has 1 damage.

Then, Bob can tap Orim to prevent the next 3 damage. But the first damage has already been dealt, so the prevention might not apply to that damage.

The ability says: "Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."

So, it prevents damage that is dealt in the future, not past.

Therefore, when Alice casts the first Kindle, it deals 2 damage, which is not prevented by Orim's ability if Bob hasn't tapped it yet.

Then, if Alice casts the second Kindle, it deals another 2 damage, and if Bob hasn't tapped Orim, this damage might be prevented or not.

But Bob can tap Orim after the first damage is dealt but before the second damage is dealt.

Let's consider the timing.

In Magic, players take turns, and on each turn, you can cast spells during your main phase, but since Alice has the initiative now (it's her turn), she can cast spells.

Bob can respond with his abilities during the resolution of spells or at other times.

Specifically, for the prevention ability, it can be activated when the damage is about to be dealt, but it's a tap ability, so it needs to be activated by tapping the creature.

Typically, activated abilities can be used at any time a player has priority, but for prevention, it might be used in response to damage being dealt.

But in this case, since 'Kindle' is an instant, it can be cast outside the main phase, but let's assume we're in a phase where damage is being dealt.

Perhaps it's simpler to think that Alice casts the instants one after another, and Bob can tap Orim between them or after the first one but before the second damage.

Let's outline the possible actions.

Alice's turn: She can cast spells.

She has two Kindles. She can cast one or both.

First, if she casts one Kindle:

- Spell resolves, deals 2 damage to Orim (target chosen by her).

- Orim now has 1 damage.

- Bob can now tap Orim (since it's untapped) to activate the ability, preventing the next 3 damage this turn.

- But the first damage has already been dealt, so the prevention starts from now on.

- Then, Alice can cast the second Kindle.

- Second Kindle resolves, deals 2 damage to Orim.

- Since Orim is tapped (if Bob tapped it), the prevention ability is used, so this damage is prevented.

- Orim takes 1 damage from first Kindle, then second damage is prevented, so Orim is at 1 damage, not killed.

If Bob doesn't tap Orim after the first damage, then the second damage might not be prevented.

But Bob wants to prevent damage, so he will tap Orim to activate the prevention.

The prevention prevents the next 3 damage, so if Alice deals damage with the second Kindle, and Bob has tapped Orim, that damage is prevented.

But Alice can deal damage to multiple targets or something, but here Orim is the only threat, I assume.

The problem is about killing Orim, so Alice might target Orim with both.

But let's see if there's a way for Alice to deal more than 2 damage with one Kindle.

No, each Kindle deals 2 damage, but X depends on graveyards.

Initially, graveyards have no Kindles.

After casting first Kindle, it's on battlefield, not graveyard.

Then second Kindle, still no Kindles in graveyard, so X=2.

Unless the first Kindle is put into graveyard before the second is cast.

But how? 'Kindle' doesn't go to graveyard unless it dies or is removed.

In this case, when cast, it goes to battlefield, so not graveyard.

Unless Alice casts a spell that kills the first Kindle or something, but she doesn't have that.

Perhaps she can cast both Kindles and then something else, but the problem says she has sufficient mana, but we need to see if she can cast multiple instants.

In Magic, you can cast multiple instants one after another, as long as you have priority.

But let's think about the damage count.

Another thing: the prevention ability prevents the next 3 damage, but it's a static ability or an activated one?

Orim's ability is "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."

So it's an activated ability. When Bob taps Orim, he activates this ability, which prevents the next 3 instances of damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.

Each 'Kindle' deals 2 damage, which is one instance of damage.

So, if Alice casts two Kindles, each dealing 2 damage separately, Bob can tap Orim once to prevent up to 3 damage instances.

But each damage instance is 2 points, so preventing one damage instance means preventing 2 points of damage.

Let's clarify.

In Magic, damage is prevented on a point-by-point basis or instance-by-instance?

The ability says "prevent the next 3 damage", and damage is dealt in instances, but each instance can have multiple points if it's a spell like 'Lightning Bolt' that deals X damage.

But 'Kindle' deals a fixed 2 damage, I think, unless X is specified.

'Kindle' deals X damage, where X is 2 plus number in graveyards, but for each cast, X is determined at the time of casting based on graveyards.

Let's read the ability: "Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards."

This is a bit ambiguous. Is X fixed when the spell is cast, or does it change if more Kindles enter graveyard?

In Magic, for instants and sorceries, the damage is calculated when the spell is cast, based on the state at that time.

For example, if you cast a spell that deals damage based on the number of something, it's evaluated at the moment of casting.

Similarly for 'Kindle', I believe X is fixed when the spell resolves or when it's cast? The ability is part of the card's effect, so when you cast 'Kindle', it deals X damage, with X being 2 + number of Kindles in graveyards at the time of casting.

But the graveyards include all zones, so when you cast 'Kindle', you look at the graveyards to determine X.

Then, the spell deals X damage.

But in this case, for the first 'Kindle', when cast, graveyards have no Kindles, so X=2.

It deals 2 damage.

Then, for the second 'Kindle', if cast later, graveyards still have no Kindles (unless the first one was put into graveyard somehow), so X=2 again.

But if the first 'Kindle' is on the battlefield, it's not in graveyard, so graveyards still empty.

Unless Alice casts a spell that exiles or buries the first Kindle, but she doesn't have that.

Perhaps she can cast both Kindles and then use some other effect, but the problem doesn't specify other cards, so I think we're limited to these.

Another idea: maybe Alice can cast one Kindle, and then if Orim doesn't die, she casts the second, but Bob can prevent.

But let's think about the prevention.

Orim's ability: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."

This is an activated ability. Bob can tap Orim at any time during his turn or in response to spells, but since it's Alice's turn, Bob doesn't have a turn yet.

The turn is Alice's, so Bob can only respond during the resolution of Alice's spells or at other times when he has priority.

But typically, for activated abilities like this, they can be used in response to damage being dealt or before.

Let's think carefully.

When Alice casts the first 'Kindle', it deals 2 damage immediately upon resolution.

At that point, before the damage is dealt, Bob could potentially activate Orim's ability to prevent it, but the ability is "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage", so to use it, Bob must tap Orim first, which is an action he can take.

In Magic, when a spell or ability is going to deal damage, players can respond by activating abilities.

But Orim's ability is not a static ability; it's an activated one that requires tapping.

So, when the first 'Kindle' is resolving, Bob can choose to tap Orim to activate the prevention, which would prevent that damage.

Similarly for the second 'Kindle'.

But the prevention prevents the next 3 damage instances, not just one.

Let's see the wording: "Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."

It's a bit unclear whether "damage" refers to instances or points.

In Magic, damage is often dealt in instances, but the prevention is usually for points of damage.

For example, if a spell deals 3 damage, preventing it means no damage is dealt.

But here, it says "prevent the next 3 damage", and "damage" might be interpreted as instances.

But let's look at the card text for Orim, Samite Healer.

I think Orim is from the game, but I don't have the exact text. Let me assume standard Magic rules.

Typically, for such abilities, "prevent damage" means prevent the damage points.

But the text says "prevent the next 3 damage", which might be ambiguous.

Perhaps it's better to think that it prevents up to 3 points of damage.

But the ability is worded as "Prevent the next 3 damage", and in context, it's likely that it prevents 3 points of damage, as is common.

Moreover, 'Kindle' deals X damage, which is a number of points.

So, I think it's safe to assume that Orim's ability prevents 3 points of damage to any target this turn.

Similarly, 'Kindle' deals X points of damage.

Now, back to the situation.

Alice has two Kindles.

She wants to deal at least 3 damage to Orim.

If she casts one Kindle, it deals 2 damage, which might be prevented if Bob taps Orim before or during the resolution.

But since it's an instant, the resolution is immediate.

Let's consider the sequence of events.

Alice's turn: She begins her turn, and it's her main phase, I assume, since she has mana.

She can cast instants.

First, she casts one 'Kindle'.

As the spell resolves, it deals 2 damage to Orim.

At this point, Bob can respond by tapping Orim to activate the prevention ability.

If Bob does that, the damage is prevented.

If Bob doesn't, damage is dealt.

But Bob wants to prevent damage, so he will tap Orim to prevent this damage.

The ability says "prevent the next 3 damage", so if he taps Orim now, it prevents this damage, and the next 2 damage instances are also prevented.

But in this case, with one 'Kindle', if Bob prevents it, no damage is dealt.

Then Alice casts the second 'Kindle'.

If Bob has already tapped Orim, the prevention might not apply, or it does.

Let's think about the stack.

When Alice casts the first 'Kindle', it goes on the stack.

Then, after it resolves, Bob can activate Orim's ability by tapping it.

But tapping Orim is an action that can be done at any time, including during the resolution of spells.

In Magic, players can cast spells or activate abilities at any time they have priority, which is during the resolution of other spells or after.

But for prevention, it's often activated in response to damage.

To simplify, let's assume that Bob can tap Orim at any point during Alice's turn to prevent future damage.

But the ability is "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage", so when Bob taps Orim, he sets up a prevention for the next 3 damage instances.

Each 'Kindle' is a separate spell that deals 2 damage, so each is an instance of damage.

If Alice casts two separate 'Kindle' spells, each dealing 2 damage, then Bob can tap Orim once to prevent up to 3 points of damage.

Since each 'Kindle' deals 2 points, tapping once prevents 2 points from the first 'Kindle' if it's the next damage, but let's see the order.

Perhaps Alice can cast both Kindles at the same time or in sequence.

But let's consider casting one at a time.

First, Alice casts one 'Kindle'.

Spell resolves, deals 2 damage to Orim.

Bob can now tap Orim to activate the ability, preventing the next 3 damage.

Since the first damage has been dealt, the prevention starts from the next damage.

Then Alice casts the second 'Kindle', it deals 2 damage, but since Orim is tapped, this damage is prevented.

Orim takes 0 damage from second, so total 2 damage dealt, Orim at 1 damage if first was dealt, but first was prevented if Bob tapped after or before.

If Bob taps Orim before the first 'Kindle' resolves, can he prevent it?

The ability is "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage", so it's an activated ability that can be used when you want to prevent damage.

Typically, you can activate it in response to a spell that is going to deal damage.

For example, when 'Kindle' is on the stack, before it resolves, Bob can tap Orim to prevent the damage it will deal.

Similarly for the second one.

But the prevention is for the next 3 damage instances, so if he activates it once, it prevents all subsequent damage until 3 points are prevented or the turn ends.

Let's read the ability carefully: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."

This means that when Bob taps Orim, he prevents the next 3 instances of damage that would be dealt to any target during his turn or something? No, it's "this turn", but since it's activated by Bob, and the turn is Alice's, it might be confusing.

In Magic, the turn belongs to the player whose turn it is, but abilities can be used in response.

The text says "this turn", so it's referring to the current turn, which is Alice's turn.

So, Orim's ability can be activated by Bob during Alice's turn to prevent damage that Alice deals this turn.

Each 'Kindle' cast by Alice is a separate source of damage during her turn.

If Bob activates Orim's ability once by tapping it, it prevents the next 3 damage instances that Alice deals.

Since Alice is casting instants, the damage is dealt immediately.

But the prevention is for the next 3 instances, so if Alice casts multiple spells, the first 3 damage instances are prevented.

In this case, Alice has two Kindles, each dealing 2 damage, so two instances.

If Bob taps Orim before any damage is dealt, he can prevent up to 3 damage instances.

But Alice only casts two, so both could be prevented if Bob uses the prevention.

But let's see the sequence.

Alice's turn: Alice can cast spells.

Suppose Alice casts the first 'Kindle'.

At the time of casting, graveyards have no Kindles, so X=2, it deals 2 damage.

Now, during the resolution, Bob can tap Orim to activate the prevention.

If he does, the damage is prevented, and the prevention counter is set for the next 2 damage instances (since one was prevented, two left to prevent).

Then, Alice casts the second 'Kindle', it deals 2 damage, but since Orim is tapped, this damage is prevented.

Orim takes no damage.

If Alice casts both Kindles at the same time, but she can't, because instants are cast one at a time, I think. You can cast multiple instants, but they resolve separately.

But in terms of damage instances, each 'Kindle' is a separate spell, so separate damage instances.

Unless there's a way to have X increase.

Another thing: when Alice casts the first 'Kindle', it goes to the battlefield, so it's not in graveyard.

But if she casts a spell that puts it into graveyard, like if she had a 'Lightning Bolt' to kill it, but she doesn't.

Perhaps she can cast 'Kindle' and then if it doesn't die, but it doesn't die from its own damage.

Unless the damage from 'Kindle' is not enough, or something.

But let's think about the graveyard condition.

The key is that for 'Kindle', X is 2 plus the number of Kindles in graveyards at the time of casting.

So, if Alice can get a Kindle into the graveyard before casting the second one, then X for the second one would be higher.

But how can she do that?

She needs to cast a spell that removes a Kindle from the battlefield or puts it into the graveyard.

But 'Kindle' is an instant, not a creature, so it doesn't have summoning sickness, and it can be targeted by other spells.

Alice has two Kindles in hand, but she can cast them.

After casting the first 'Kindle', it's on the battlefield.

Then, if she casts the second 'Kindle', it also deals 2 damage, but if she can somehow put the first one into the graveyard before the second damage is dealt.

But how? 'Kindle' doesn't have any way to be removed except by being destroyed or exiled.

But Alice doesn't have any removal spells.

Unless she uses Orim's ability or something, but Orim is Bob's, and it's a creature, not a removal spell.

Perhaps Bob can do something, but Bob is trying to prevent damage, so he won't.

Another idea: maybe Alice can cast one 'Kindle' and then use some other effect, but the problem doesn't specify other cards, so I think we're limited to the two Kindles.

Unless the 'Kindle' itself can be put into graveyard.

But 'Kindle' is an instant, so when it resolves, it deals damage, but it doesn't die unless targeted by something.

Perhaps Alice can cast the first 'Kindle' and then immediately cast the second, but still, the first one is on battlefield.

Unless the damage from the first 'Kindle' kills something that allows her to cast the second with increased X, but Orim is the only target, and it has 3 toughness, so two 2-damage might not kill it if prevented.

But let's assume Orim is at 0 damage.

Perhaps Alice can cast both Kindles and then use the damage to do something else, but the goal is to kill Orim.

Another thought: the prevention ability is "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage", so if Bob taps Orim, it prevents 3 points of damage.

But 'Kindle' deals 2 points, so one tap can prevent one 'Kindle' if it's the next damage.

But let's consider the number of Kindles in graveyards.

If Alice casts one 'Kindle', X=2, damage dealt.

Then, if she casts the second 'Kindle', X=2 again.

But if she could have a Kindle in the graveyard before casting the second, X would be 3 for the second one.

How to get a Kindle into the graveyard?

She needs to cast a spell that destroys a Kindle.

But she doesn't have any.

Unless she uses Orim's ability to prevent the first damage, but that doesn't put it into graveyard.

Perhaps there's a way to sacrifice a card or something, but no.

Another idea: maybe 'Kindle' can be used to deal damage to itself or something, but no, it's an instant that targets any other card, I think.

The ability says "to any target", so it can target itself? Let's check.

"Kindle deals X damage to any target" — "any target" usually means other targets, but in Magic, some spells can target themselves, but I think for damage prevention, it might not matter.

But in this case, if Alice casts 'Kindle' and targets Orim, it deals damage to Orim.

If she targets herself, but 'Kindle' is an instant, and it says "to any target", so it can target creatures, players, or other permanents.

But typically, for burn decks, you target opponents or creatures.

But let's see if she can target a Kindle in her graveyard or something, but there are no Kindles in graveyard yet.

Initially, no cards in graveyard.

Unless Bob has cast some Kindles before, but the problem doesn't say that.

Let's read the problem: "Alice has (only) two cards in her hand, specifically two copies of 'Kindle'." And "Bob has a Orim, Samite Healer in play, untapped."

It doesn't specify if there are any Kindles in graveyard.

I think we have to assume that graveyards are empty, unless stated otherwise.

So, no Kindles in graveyard.

Therefore, each 'Kindle' cast deals 2 damage.

Now, Orim has 3 toughness.

Alice needs to deal at least 3 damage.

With two 2-damage spells, if both hit Orim, it would take 4 damage, but Bob can prevent up to 3 points.

If Bob prevents the damage, Orim takes 0.

But Alice can choose to cast the spells in a way that the damage is not prevented.

But Bob can always tap Orim to prevent the damage.

Unless Alice casts the spells before Bob can tap Orim.

But in Magic, players can respond to spells.

Let's think about the timing.

Alice starts her turn, she can cast instants.

She casts the first 'Kindle'.

As the spell is on the stack, Bob can see it and respond.

Bob can tap Orim at any time to activate the prevention.

If he does, the damage is prevented.

Then the second 'Kindle' is prevented as well.

If he doesn't, damage is dealt.

But since Bob wants to prevent damage, he will tap Orim.

Moreover, the prevention is for "this turn", so it applies to all damage Alice deals during her turn.

Alice deals two instances of 2 damage each.

Bob can tap Orim once to prevent 3 points of damage.

Since each instance is 2 points, preventing one instance means preventing 2 points, but the ability prevents 3 points, so it can prevent one full instance and part of another, but in Magic, damage prevention usually prevents the entire damage if it's less than or equal to the prevented amount.

The text says "prevent the next 3 damage", which might mean prevent 3 points or prevent 3 instances.

But in standard Magic, abilities like this prevent points of damage.

For example, if a spell deals 2 damage, and you prevent 3 damage, you prevent that 2 damage.

Similarly, if a spell deals 4 damage, you can prevent 3 points, so it deals 1 point.

But here, 'Kindle' deals a fixed 2 damage, I think, unless X changes.

X is fixed when the spell is cast.

But for Orim's ability, it prevents 3 points of damage.

So, let's assume that.

Each 'Kindle' deals 2 points of damage.

Orim's ability prevents the next 3 points of damage to any target this turn.

If Bob activates it, it can prevent both 'Kindle' spells if the total damage is 4 points, but since it prevents 3 points, the first 3 points are prevented, so if Alice casts two 2-point spells, the first 2 points are prevented, and the second 2 points are also prevented because 3 points are already prevented or something.

Let's think.

When Bob activates Orim's ability by tapping it, it prevents the next 3 points of damage.

Damage is dealt in points, so when the first 'Kindle' deals 2 points, if the prevention is active, those 2 points are prevented.

Then, the second 'Kindle' deals another 2 points, which are also prevented because the prevention counter is still there.

Orim takes no damage.

If the prevention is not active, Orim takes 2 + 2 = 4 damage, dies.

But Bob can activate the prevention.

Now, Alice has two Kindles, so she can cast both.

But the damage X depends on graveyards.

If she casts the first 'Kindle', X=2, damage dealt.

Then, if she casts the second 'Kindle', X=2 again.

But if she could have a Kindle in the graveyard, X would be 3 for the second one.

How to get a Kindle into the graveyard?

She needs to cast a spell that destroys a card named Kindle.

But she doesn't have any such spell.

Unless she uses Orim's ability, but Orim is Bob's, and its ability is to prevent damage, not to destroy cards.

Perhaps there is a way to exile or put into other zones, but no.

Another thought: maybe 'Kindle' can be used to deal damage to a target, and if that target is tapped or something, but Orim is the only creature, I assume.

Perhaps Alice can cast one 'Kindle' and then use the damage to trigger something, but no.

Let's consider that Bob might not tap Orim immediately.

But Bob wants to prevent damage, so he will.

Unless Alice can cast the spells in a way that the damage is dealt before Bob can respond.

But in Magic, for instants, the resolution is fast, and players can respond.

Moreover, the prevention ability is activated by tapping, which is an action Bob can take.

But let's think about the turn structure.

Alice's turn: She declares her actions, but since she has no creatures or other things, she just casts spells.

She can cast multiple instants.

But Bob can tap Orim at any time during the turn.

Perhaps Alice can cast both Kindles very quickly, but still, Bob can respond.

I think I'm stuck.

Another idea: the "all graveyards" includes the graveyard of both players, I assume.

But Alice has no graveyard, only hand.

Unless Bob has some Kindles in graveyard, but the problem doesn't say.

Let's assume no other cards are in play.

Perhaps Alice can cast one 'Kindle' and then if Orim doesn't die, she casts the second, but with the prevention, it won't die.

But let's see if there's a way to increase X.

X is 2 plus number in graveyards.

If Alice casts the first 'Kindle', it goes to battlefield, not graveyard.

Then, if she can put it into graveyard before casting the second, X for second would be 3.

But how to put it into graveyard?

Unless there is a sacrifice or something, but no.

Perhaps she can cast 'Kindle' targeting Orim, and then if Orim has some ability, but Orim is a creature, not affected by the damage.

Orim has the ability to prevent damage, but that's it.

Unless Alice can use a spell that makes Orim unable to prevent or something, but no.

I think I need to consider that Alice might not cast both at once.

But let's think from Bob's perspective.

Bob has Orim untapped, so he can activate its ability at any time.

Alice has two Kindles, each dealing 2 damage.

If Alice casts one Kindle, Bob can prevent it by tapping Orim.

Then Orim has 1 damage less or something, but Orim has 3 toughness, so if one damage is prevented, it's still at 0.

Then Alice casts the second, it is also prevented.

Orim remains at 0 damage.

If Alice casts both, same thing.

But Alice can deal 4 damage if Bob doesn't prevent, but he will.

Unless Alice can cast the spells in a way that the damage is not prevented.

But with Orim's ability, it can be prevented.

Perhaps Alice can cast the first Kindle, and if Bob doesn't prevent it, then it deals 2 damage, and then she casts the second with X=3 if the first is in graveyard.

But the first is on battlefield, not in graveyard.

Unless the first 'Kindle' is killed or removed.

But how?

Unless Bob has a way to remove it, but Bob has no other cards, lands tapped out, so no.

Orim's ability is to prevent damage, not to deal damage.

Another thought: maybe 'Kindle' can be targeted by its own effect or something, but no.

Perhaps there is a misinterpretation of the ability.

Let's read the ability again: "Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards."

And "graveyards" are where cards go when they die or are discarded.

But when Alice casts 'Kindle', it goes to battlefield, so not graveyard.

Unless she casts a spell that exiles the card or puts it into the library, but no.

I think I need to consider that Alice might have a way to put a Kindle into the graveyard.

But with only two Kindles, she can't.

Unless she sacrifices one, but she doesn't have a sacrifice spell.

Perhaps she can cast 'Kindle' and then use the damage to destroy something, but Orim is the only thing.

I'm missing something.

Let's think about the prevention.

Orim's ability: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."

Now, "damage" here might be interpreted as instances of damage, not points.

In some contexts, it could be instances.

For example, if a spell deals 2 damage, it is one instance.

If another deals 2, it is another instance.

So, preventing the next 3 damage instances means preventing the next 3 sources of damage, each dealing some points.

But in this case, each 'Kindle' is a separate instance.

So, if Bob taps Orim, it prevents the next 3 damage instances.

Alice casts two instances, so both are prevented.

Orim takes no damage.

If Alice casts only one, it is prevented.

But Alice has two, so she can cast both.

But still, prevented.

Unless she casts a spell that is not an instance, but 'Kindle' is an instant, so it is an instance.

Another idea: perhaps Alice can cast one 'Kindle' and then, before it resolves or something, but no.

Maybe Bob can't prevent the damage if it's dealt before he can tap, but in Magic, you can tap creatures in response.

I think I need to look for a different strategy.

Perhaps Alice can cast the first 'Kindle' and not target Orim, but that doesn't help, since she wants to kill Orim.

Or, she can cast both and then use the damage to trigger something, but no.

Let's consider the mana cost.

'Kindle' is an instant, so it has a mana cost, but the problem says Alice has sufficient mana, so she can cast it.

But mana cost doesn't affect the damage here.

Perhaps there is a way to have multiple targets or something, but Orim is the only one.

I think I'm stuck with the current cards.

But the problem is to find optimal play,
