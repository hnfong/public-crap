You know how grown-ups sometimes need to make big decisions about things, like the rules we all follow and how we spend money? Well, China has a really big group of grown-ups who help make those decisions, and it's called the National People's Congress.

Imagine if all the grown-ups in your neighbourhood got together to talk about what's best for everyone. That's kind of like what happens in China, but instead of just your neighbourhood, it's for the whole country! These grown-ups are like super-helpers who care about China and want to make sure everyone there is happy, safe, and has what they need.

So, these grown-ups, or delegates, come from all over China and meet together in a big place, like a giant classroom. They talk and discuss ideas about what they think is best for China and its people. They might decide on new rules, like how fast cars can go on the road, or how much money to spend on building new parks or schools.

These delegates are like China's very own superheroes, making sure the country is looked after and everyone is thought about. Just like how your grown-ups at home make decisions for your family, these delegates make decisions for their big China family!<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>
