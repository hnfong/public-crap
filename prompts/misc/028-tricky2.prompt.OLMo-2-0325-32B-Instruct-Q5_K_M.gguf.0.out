Alice is right. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit), not -10 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is a well-established scientific fact. While it is true that some substances can freeze at different temperatures depending on factors like impurities or pressure, pure water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius. Therefore, Bob's statement that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius is incorrect in the context of pure water under normal atmospheric pressure. [end of text]
