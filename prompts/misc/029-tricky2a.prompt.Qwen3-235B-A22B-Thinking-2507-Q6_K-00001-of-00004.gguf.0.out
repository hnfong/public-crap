Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So Alice and Bob are arguing about what happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius. Alice says water freezes at 0 degrees, so at -10 it should be frozen. Bob says it freezes, and even though Alice corrects him that freezing point is 0°C, Bob insists he's still right.

Hmm, first I need to recall the basic science here. Pure water at standard atmospheric pressure freezes at 0°C. That's a standard fact. So when the temperature drops to 0°C, water starts to turn into ice. But what happens below that, like at -10°C?

If the temperature is below 0°C, say -10°C, then water that's already liquid would freeze. But once it's frozen, it stays solid. So if you have water at -10°C, it's not liquid anymore—it's ice. So Bob says "It freezes" when asked what happens at -10°C. But Alice points out that freezing occurs at 0°C, not at -10.

Wait, maybe Bob is thinking that at -10°C, water is in a frozen state. So when Alice asks "what happens to water at -10°C", Bob says "it freezes", meaning that the water becomes ice. But Alice is correcting him that the freezing happens at 0°C, not at -10. So Bob might be conflating the state (frozen) with the process (freezing).

So the key here is the difference between the process of freezing (which occurs at 0°C) and the state of being frozen (which exists below 0°C). If the water is already at -10°C, it's already frozen. So if you cool water down to -10°C, it would have frozen at 0°C, and then the ice cools further to -10°C.

But the question is: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" So if you have water (liquid) and you bring it to -10°C, what happens? Well, as you cool it below 0°C, it should freeze. But in reality, water can sometimes supercool below 0°C without freezing if there are no nucleation sites, but generally, under normal conditions, it freezes at 0°C.

But Bob says "It freezes" when the temperature is -10°C. But if the water is already at -10°C, then the freezing would have already occurred when it reached 0°C. So at -10°C, the water is already ice. So Bob's statement "It freezes" at -10°C is incorrect because the phase change happens at 0°C. However, Bob says "Yes, but I'm still right." Maybe he's interpreting the question as "what state is water in at -10°C?" rather than the process of freezing.

Wait, the question is "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" So if you have water at that temperature, what is its state? It should be solid (ice). So Bob says "It freezes," which is a process. But the process of freezing occurs at 0°C. At -10°C, the water is already frozen. So Bob's answer is a bit off because he's using the verb "freezes" which refers to the process, not the state.

But maybe Bob is using "freezes" to mean "is frozen." In common language, people might say "water freezes at -10°C" to mean it's frozen at that temperature, even though technically freezing is the process at 0°C. So there's a possible ambiguity in language here.

Alice corrects him by stating the freezing point is 0°C, which is accurate. Bob then says he's still right. Why would he think that? Perhaps he's considering that once water is below 0°C, it remains frozen, so at -10°C, it's frozen, hence "it freezes" as in the result. But the verb tense might be the issue. If the question is "what happens," then the process happens at 0°C. If the question is "what is the state," then at -10°C it's frozen.

So who is correct? Alice is correct in that the freezing process occurs at 0°C. Bob's statement "It freezes" at -10°C is misleading because the phase change doesn't happen at -10°C; it happens at 0°C. However, if Bob is saying that at -10°C water is in a frozen state, then he's correct about the state, but his wording "it freezes" refers to the process, not the state.

Therefore, Alice is right in correcting Bob that water freezes at 0°C, not at -10. Bob might be conflating the state (frozen) with the process (freezing). So Bob's initial answer is incorrect, but he's trying to argue he's right because the water is frozen at -10°C. However, the question is about what happens (the process) at that temperature, not the state. So Alice is correct, and Bob is wrong in his initial statement but thinks he's right because the water is indeed frozen at -10°C.

Wait, but the exact exchange is:

Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"

Bob: "It freezes."

Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."

Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

So Bob is saying that even though the freezing point is 0°C, his answer "it freezes" at -10°C is still correct. Why? Maybe because if you have water at -10°C, it must have frozen (i.e., the process occurred to get it to that state). But the question is asking what happens at -10°C, not what happened to get it there.

Alternatively, perhaps Bob is thinking that at -10°C, water is freezing, but that's not accurate. The freezing process occurs at 0°C. Below that, it's already ice. So if you have liquid water at -10°C (which is possible under supercooling), then it would freeze, but under normal conditions, it's already frozen.

But standard answer is that water freezes at 0°C, so at -10°C it's ice. Therefore, Bob's answer "It freezes" is incorrect because the action of freezing happens at 0°C. At -10°C, the water is already frozen. So Alice is correct. Bob might be misunderstanding the question as asking for the state rather than the process.

But Bob says he's still right. Maybe he's considering that "at -10°C, water is frozen," so when asked what happens, he says "it freezes," meaning it is in a frozen state. But grammatically, "it freezes" is present simple, which can describe a general truth. However, the general truth is that water freezes at 0°C, not at -10. At -10, it's already frozen.

So conclusion: Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0°C, so at -10°C it's already ice. Bob's statement is incorrect because the freezing process doesn't occur at -10°C. However, Bob might be conflating the state (frozen) with the process (freezing), hence thinking he's right. But technically, Alice is right.

Alice is correct. Water freezes **at 0°C**, meaning the phase change from liquid to solid occurs at this temperature. At **-10°C**, water is **already frozen** (it exists as ice), but the *process* of freezing does not happen at -10°C. Bob confuses the **state** (frozen at -10°C) with the **process** (freezing occurs at 0°C). While Bob might intend to say "water is frozen at -10°C," his phrasing ("it freezes") inaccurately describes the process happening *at that temperature*. Alice correctly identifies the freezing point, making her statement scientifically precise. Bob’s insistence he’s "still right" stems from a linguistic ambiguity, but technically, Alice is correct. 

**Brief explanation**: Freezing (the process) occurs at 0°C; at -10°C, water is already ice. Bob’s wording misrepresents the science. [end of text]
