If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

In logic and mathematics, a theory is considered "consistent" if it does not lead to a contradiction. A theory is "tautological" if all its statements are true, but this doesn't necessarily mean it's consistent. Here are some examples:

1. **Consistent but not Tautological**: Peano Arithmetic (PA) is a consistent theory, meaning it doesn't prove both a statement and its negation. However, it's not tautological because it doesn't prove all statements true. For example, PA doesn't prove that 2 + 2 = 5.

2. **Tautological but not Consistent**: The theory that includes both a statement and its negation is tautological because it proves everything true (including contradictions). However, it's not consistent because it leads to a contradiction.

3. **Consistent and Tautological**: The theory that includes only tautologies (logically true statements) is both consistent (it doesn't prove contradictions) and tautological (it proves all statements true). An example is the theory that includes only statements of the form "P ∨ ¬P" for any statement P.

4. **Inconsistent and not Tautological**: The theory that includes both a statement and its negation is inconsistent because it leads to a contradiction. It's not tautological because it doesn't prove all statements true.
