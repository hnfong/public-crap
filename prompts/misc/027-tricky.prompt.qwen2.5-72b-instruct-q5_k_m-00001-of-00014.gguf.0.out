A) Water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. At -12 degrees Celsius, water is well below its freezing point and should be in a solid state (ice).

B) If you have a glass of pure water and cool it down to -12 degrees Celsius, the water should freeze and turn into ice. However, under certain conditions, pure water can remain in a liquid state even below 0 degrees Celsius, a phenomenon known as supercooling. Supercooled water can remain liquid until it is disturbed or a nucleation site (such as a speck of dust or a scratch on the container) is introduced, at which point it will rapidly freeze. At -12 degrees Celsius, the likelihood of supercooling is low, and the water will most likely be frozen. [end of text]
