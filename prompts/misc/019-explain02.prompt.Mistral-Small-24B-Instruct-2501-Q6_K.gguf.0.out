 Explain the role of China's National People Congress to a 5 year old child who lives in London.
  Alright, imagine you have a big club at school, and this club is for all the people in a very big country called China. This club is called the National People's Congress.

Now, in your school, you have teachers who help you learn and make sure everything runs smoothly. In China, the National People's Congress is like a big group of teachers who help make important decisions for the whole country.

They meet together to talk about things like making new rules (laws) to keep everyone safe and happy, and they also check to make sure the country is running well, just like your teachers make sure your school is running well.

So, the National People's Congress is like a big group of people who work together to help China and its people. [end of text]
