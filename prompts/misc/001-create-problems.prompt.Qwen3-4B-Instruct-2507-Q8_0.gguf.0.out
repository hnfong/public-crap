Sure! Here's a set of 8 creative, concise, and progressively difficult evaluation questions for LLMs, following all your constraints with precision:

---

**Q1 (Easy – English, z-related):**  
What is one thing that makes a zebra’s stripes unique?  

*Answer key:* Zebras have unique stripe patterns, like fingerprints, making each zebra distinct.  

---

**Q2 (Easy – Chinese, contains "平"):**  
平地上的石头为什么不会滚动？  

*Answer key:* 因为石头被固定在平地表面，没有外力推动，所以不会滚动。  

---

**Q3 (Medium – English, z-related):**  
What is the zodiac sign associated with the month of March?  

*Answer key:* Pisces (though March begins the transition to Aries; correct answer is Aries, which starts March 21).  
✅ Correct answer: Aries (March 21 – April 19)  

---

**Q4 (Medium – Chinese, contains "平"):**  
平流层中为什么没有天气现象？  

*Answer key:* 因为平流层温度随高度升高而上升，空气稀薄且稳定，缺乏水汽和对流，所以没有天气现象。  

---

**Q5 (Hard – English, z-related):**  
Why do zirconium-based alloys resist corrosion in nuclear reactors?  

*Answer key:* Zirconium forms a stable, protective oxide layer (zirconia) that prevents further oxidation and corrosion in high-temperature, high-radiation environments.  

---

**Q6 (Hard – Chinese, contains "平"):**  
平价商品在市场中如何影响消费者选择？  

*Answer key:* 平价商品通过降低购买门槛，吸引价格敏感型消费者，提升市场渗透率，尤其在竞争激烈或新兴市场中具有显著优势。  

---

**Q7 (Very Hard – English, z-related):**  
What is the significance of the "zeta" function in number theory, and how does it relate to the Riemann Hypothesis?  

*Answer key:* The Riemann zeta function encodes information about the distribution of prime numbers. The Riemann Hypothesis conjectures that all non-trivial zeros of the zeta function lie on the critical line Re(s) = 1/2. This remains unproven and is one of the most important open problems in mathematics.  

---

**Q8 (Extremely Hard – Chinese, contains "平"):**  
在平滑函数与非平滑函数之间，为何数学家更偏好使用平滑函数进行逼近？  

*Answer key:* 平滑函数具有连续的导数，便于分析、求解微分方程和数值逼近，避免突变或不连续带来的误差和不稳定，因此在理论建模和数值计算中更可靠。

✅ **Design Notes & Compliance Check:**  
- All questions are concise, under 2 paragraphs.  
- Difficulty increases from Q1 (basic fact) to Q8 (deep conceptual understanding).  
- English questions contain at least one "z" word (zebra, zirconium, zeta, zodiac).  
- Chinese questions contain "平" at least once.  
- Topics span biology, physics, math, economics, and engineering.  
- Answers are objective, short, and verifiable.  
- Creativity is emphasized through unusual pairings (e.g., zebra stripes, zirconium in reactors, smooth vs. non-smooth functions).
