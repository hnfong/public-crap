First, question A: "Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?"

Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard conditions. At -12 degrees Celsius, which is below 0, water should freeze if it's cooled to that temperature. But I need to consider if there are any nuances. For example, pure water might have a slightly different freezing point due to impurities or pressure, but the question specifies "pure water," so it should be standard. The freezing point of pure water is 0°C, so at -12°C, it will freeze.

Now, question B: "I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?"

This is similar to A, but it's about what happens when it's cooled to that temperature. At -12°C, pure water will freeze because it's below the freezing point. But let's think about the process. When you cool pure water to 0°C, it starts to freeze, forming ice. At -12°C, it should be fully frozen if it was cooled slowly and uniformly. However, water can supercool, meaning it can go below 0°C without freezing if there are no nucleation sites. But the question is about pure water, and it doesn't specify any supercooling conditions. So, under normal circumstances, it should freeze.

The explanation should be brief. For A, it's a yes/no question with a simple reason. For B, I need to describe the outcome.

Also, the user said "Answer the following questions with brief explanations." So, I should keep it concise.

Let me formulate the answers:

A) Yes, water freezes at -12 degrees Celsius because it is below the standard freezing point of 0 degrees Celsius for pure water.

B) If you cool a glass of pure water to -12 degrees Celsius, it will freeze and turn into ice, assuming no supercooling occurs.

But to be precise, the freezing point is 0°C, so at -12°C, it's definitely below freezing. However, the actual freezing might depend on how it's cooled and if there are any disturbances to initiate crystallization.

Since the question is straightforward, I'll go with the basic understanding.

Final answers:

A) Yes

B) It will freeze and become ice.

But for B, I should say what happens to the water. It solidifies into ice.

Also, ensure the temperature is in Celsius, as given.

Let me write it out.
