Hello there! Imagine you live in London, and your whole city has a big group of grown-ups who work together to make sure everyone is safe, happy, and that the rules are fair.

In China, there is a very special group of people called the **National People's Congress**. You can think of them as the **biggest group of helpers** in the whole country.

Here is how they work, just like in your school or your neighborhood:

1.  **They are the "Rule Makers":** Just like your teacher makes rules for the classroom so everyone can play nicely, the National People's Congress makes the big rules for the whole country of China. They decide things like how schools should work, how roads should be built, and how to take care of the parks.
2.  **They are chosen by everyone:** In China, people from all over the country choose special people to be in this group. These people listen to what regular families need and then go to the big meeting to speak up for them.
3.  **They pick the leaders:** They also help choose the people who will run the country, kind of like how your class might vote for a class monitor to help the teacher.

So, the National People's Congress is like the **super-team of grown-ups** who sit together to make sure China is a good place for all the children and families to live in. They are the most important group for making the big plans for the future! [end of text]
