Here are the brief explanations for your questions:

### A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?
**No.** Water freezes at **0 degrees Celsius** (at standard atmospheric pressure). At -12°C, water is already in a **solid (frozen) state** if it was liquid at 0°C.  

### B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?
If the water is **cooled slowly and without disturbance**, it can remain liquid (supercooled) below 0°C, but it is **unstable**. A small disturbance (e.g., shaking, adding an impurity) will cause it to **freeze rapidly**. If the water is **not supercooled**, it will **freeze completely** at 0°C and then cool further to -12°C as ice.  

### Key Points:
- **Normal freezing point of water: 0°C**  
- **Supercooling** can occur, but it's temporary.  
- At -12°C, **ice is the stable phase** of water.

### B) What happens if pure water is cooled to -12°C?  
1. **If cooled slowly without disturbance**, the water may **supercool** (remain liquid below 0°C), but it is unstable.  
2. **Any disturbance** (e.g., shaking, adding impurities) will trigger **rapid freezing** into ice.  
3. **If not supercooled**, it freezes at 0°C and cools further to -12°C as ice.  

**Key point**: At -12°C, ice is the stable state of water. Supercooling is temporary and rare.
