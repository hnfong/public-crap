 Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.
  Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell,
'Bout the Fed, the big boss in the money game, y'all.
They ain't got no fancy title, just call 'em the Fed,
They control the cash flow, make sure the economy's fed.

They print the paper, make sure it's right,
Keep inflation low, so prices don't bite.
When the economy's hot, they cool it down,
When it's cold, they heat it up, keep it in town.

They got a board, with a chair, and a crew,
They meet up, make decisions, that's true.
They set the interest rate, make it high or low,
So banks can lend, and folks can grow.

They watch the market, keep it in check,
Make sure the economy ain't a wreck.
They got a job, to keep the country strong,
Make sure the economy don't go wrong.

So when you hear about the Fed, don't be confused,
They just the ones, who keep the money game smooth.
They print the paper, make sure it's right,
Keep the economy strong, day and night. [end of text]
