If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

When a theory proves itself, it can be described in different ways depending on the nature of the proof and the context. Here are the key concepts:

1. **Consistency**: A theory is consistent if it does not contain any contradictions. That is, it is impossible to derive both a statement and its negation within the theory. Consistency is a fundamental property of a theory, but proving consistency is often a separate and non-trivial task.

2. **Tautological**: A tautology is a statement that is always true, regardless of the truth values of its components. In the context of a theory, if a theory proves a statement that is trivially true (i.e., a tautology), it does not necessarily mean the theory is tautological as a whole. However, if a theory is such that every statement it can prove is a tautology, then the theory itself can be considered tautological.

### Examples

1. **Tautological Theory**:
   - **Example**: Consider a theory with the single axiom \( P \rightarrow P \). This axiom is a tautology because it is always true. Any theory that can only prove tautologies is tautological.
   - **Explanation**: In this theory, every provable statement is a tautology, making the theory tautological.

2. **Consistent Theory**:
   - **Example**: Peano Arithmetic (PA) is a well-known theory of arithmetic. It is consistent if it does not prove both a statement and its negation. The consistency of PA is a significant result in mathematical logic, and it is not trivial to prove.
   - **Explanation**: PA is consistent if it does not contain any contradictions. The consistency of PA is a separate and important result, often established using methods like Gödel's incompleteness theorems.

3. **Self-Proving Theory**:
   - **Example**: A theory that includes a statement of its own consistency, such as \( \text{Con}(T) \), where \( T \) is the theory itself. Gödel's second incompleteness theorem states that if a sufficiently strong and consistent theory \( T \) can prove its own consistency, then \( T \) is actually inconsistent.
   - **Explanation**: If a theory \( T \) can prove \( \text{Con}(T) \), it implies that \( T \) is inconsistent. This is a profound result that shows the limitations of self-proving consistency within a theory.

### Summary

- **Tautological**: A theory is tautological if every statement it can prove is a tautology.
- **Consistent**: A theory is consistent if it does not contain any contradictions.
- **Self-Proving**: A theory that proves its own consistency is generally inconsistent, as shown by Gödel's second incompleteness theorem.

In the context of a theory proving itself, the term "tautological" is more appropriate if the theory only proves tautologies. The term "consistent" is used to describe a theory that does not contain contradictions, but proving consistency is a separate and often non-trivial task. [end of text]
