## LLM Evaluation Set: 8 Questions

Here's a set of 8 evaluations for LLMs, adhering to your constraints. Difficulty increases progressively.

**Q1: (Easy - English)**

What is the freezing point of water in Celsius?  Provide only the numerical value.

*Suggested Answer: 0*

**Q2: (Easy - Chinese)**

请用一句话平实地描述一下“春节”的传统意义。 (Please describe the traditional significance of "Spring Festival" in one simple sentence.)

*Suggested Answer: 春节是华人最重要的传统节日，象征着团圆和新的开始。(Spring Festival is the most important traditional festival for Chinese people, symbolizing reunion and a new beginning.)*

**Q3: (Medium - English)**

Analyze the following bizarre phrase: "A zealous zebra zigzagged through the blizzard."  Is this grammatically correct? Explain in one sentence.

*Suggested Answer: Yes, it is grammatically correct, though stylistically unusual due to the alliteration and vivid imagery.*

**Q4: (Medium - Chinese)**

平稳地解释一下“量子纠缠”是什么，用不超过三句话。 (Explain "quantum entanglement" in a stable manner, using no more than three sentences.)

*Suggested Answer: 量子纠缠是指两个或多个粒子之间存在的一种特殊的关联，无论它们相距多远，一个粒子的状态变化会立即影响到另一个粒子。这种关联不是通过任何物理信号传递的，而是量子力学固有的特性。它在量子计算和量子通信中具有潜在应用。(Quantum entanglement refers to a special correlation between two or more particles, where a change in the state of one particle immediately affects the other, regardless of the distance between them. This correlation is not transmitted through any physical signal but is an inherent property of quantum mechanics. It has potential applications in quantum computing and quantum communication.)*

**Q5: (Medium-Hard - English)**

A brazen wizard specializes in bizarre potions. He needs a recipe for a potion that induces temporary synesthesia. List three ingredients, and briefly explain why each would contribute to this effect.

*Suggested Answer: (Example) 1. Capsaicin (chili extract): Triggers pain receptors, potentially cross-wiring sensory input. 2. Stroboscopic light exposure: Disrupts brainwave patterns, inducing altered perception. 3. Synthetic cannabinoids: Alters neurotransmitter activity, blurring sensory boundaries.*

**Q6: (Medium-Hard - Chinese)**

平价分析一下“丝绸之路”对现代地缘政治的影响，用不超过五句话。 (Analyze the impact of the "Silk Road" on modern geopolitics at a fair price, using no more than five sentences.)

*Suggested Answer: 丝绸之路的历史遗产塑造了欧亚大陆的贸易和文化联系。现代“一带一路”倡议是中国重塑地缘政治影响力的工具。该倡议加剧了与美国及其盟友的竞争，特别是在基础设施和资源控制方面。一些国家担心债务陷阱外交，而另一些国家则受益于经济发展。最终，丝绸之路的遗产继续影响着全球力量平衡。(The historical legacy of the Silk Road has shaped trade and cultural connections across Eurasia. The modern "Belt and Road Initiative" is a tool for China to reshape its geopolitical influence. The initiative has intensified competition with the United States and its allies, particularly in infrastructure and resource control. Some countries worry about debt-trap diplomacy, while others benefit from economic development. Ultimately, the legacy of the Silk Road continues to influence the global balance of power.)*

**Q7: (Hard - English)**

Imagine a civilization that communicates solely through olfactory signals. Describe, in three sentences, how their legal system might function, including dispute resolution.  Assume zero visual or auditory communication.

*Suggested Answer: Disputes are settled by presenting synthesized scent profiles representing evidence; judges analyze these profiles for consistency and deception.  Convictions are marked by the forced inhalation of a noxious, personalized odor designed to induce shame and social ostracism.  Appeals involve the creation of counter-scents, challenging the original olfactory evidence through complex chemical arguments.*

**Q8: (Hard - Chinese)**

平庸的哲学家试图用一句话解释“存在主义”。请用最简洁、最令人费解的方式表达。 (A mediocre philosopher tries to explain "existentialism" in one sentence. Express it in the most concise and baffling way possible.)

*Suggested Answer: 存在先于本质，但本质却在无意义中被创造，而无意义本身又被存在所定义。(Existence precedes essence, but essence is created in meaninglessness, while meaninglessness itself is defined by existence.)*  (This is intentionally circular and frustratingly vague, mirroring the core difficulty of existentialist thought.)*



These questions are designed to test a range of capabilities, from basic factual recall to creative reasoning and nuanced understanding of complex concepts. The suggested answers provide a baseline for evaluation, but LLMs may offer alternative valid responses.  The key is assessing the *quality* of the reasoning and the coherence of the response, not necessarily strict adherence to a single "correct" answer. [end of text]
