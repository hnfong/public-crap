Looking at these lyrics, I can see a fantastical story about a mysterious forest restaurant that operates in a dreamlike, otherworldly realm.

**The Story:**

This is about a small restaurant hidden deep in a forest that's nearly impossible to find - you can follow acorns (ドングリ) as markers, but they won't lead you there. The restaurant seems to exist in a liminal space, accessible only to those who have been forgotten by the world or have forgotten themselves.

The establishment is mostly empty, with plenty of seats available even during lunch hours, suggesting its clientele are not ordinary living people. The laughing birds and dancing bear (手乗りの子熊) hint at a magical, almost nursery-rhyme-like atmosphere.

The restaurant serves an ever-changing menu of fancy dishes (calpacho, paella, risotto), but notably lacks dessert - instead offering to deliver the final full course all the way to one's grave. This suggests the restaurant caters to spirits, ghosts, or those in transition between life and death.

The phrase "you're welcome, welcome, come on in" followed by "if you eat your fill, time to sleep" and "farewell everyone" has a lullaby quality, but with darker undertones. The final line about tomorrow being "etcetera" suggests this is an endless, cyclical existence.

**Literal Interpretation:**
This could be a restaurant that exists in the afterlife or spirit world - a place where forgotten souls or memories go to find temporary comfort before moving on. The "forest" represents the boundary between worlds, and the establishment serves as a waystation for those who have been left behind or have lost their way in the transition from life to whatever comes next.

The mischievous tone comes from the playful yet ominous nature of this supernatural hospitality. [end of text]
