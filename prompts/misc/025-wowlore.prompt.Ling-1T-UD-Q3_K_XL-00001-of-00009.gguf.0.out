Here is a location from **original World of Warcraft (Vanilla, pre-expansion) lore** for each letter of the alphabet, using only places established in Azeroth, Kalimdor, and their immediate known regions up to 2004–2006 lore:

- **A** – **Azeroth** (The Eastern Kingdoms; the world itself shares its name)  
- **B** – **Booty Bay** (Stranglethorn Vale; neutral goblin port city)  
- **C** – **Caer Darrow** (Western Plaguelands; ancient human fortress, now Scourge-held)  
- **D** – **Duskwood** (Southern Elwynn Forest border; cursed, shadow-haunted woodland)  
- **E** – **Elwynn Forest** (Starting zone for humans; peaceful woodland near Stormwind)  
- **F** – **Feralas** (Kalimdor; wild, ancient forest home to furbolgs and druids)  
- **G** – **Gadgetzan** (Tanaris; goblin-controlled desert port in southern Kalimdor)  
- **H** – **Hillsbrad Foothills** (Arathi Highlands south; contested farmland near the Horde)  
- **I** – **Ironforge** (Dun Morogh; capital of the dwarves, carved into a mountain)  
- **J** – **Jintha'Alor** (Vilebranch Village in The Hinterlands; high elven/Satyr ruins)  
- **K** – **Kalimdor** (The western continent; vast wilderness, home to night elves, orcs, tauren)  
- **L** – **Loch Modan** (Eastern region of Dun Morogh; lake-filled land of the dwarves)  
- **M** – **Moonglade** (Northern Kalimdor; sacred home of druids and the Emerald Dream)  
- **N** – **Naxxramas** (Eastern Plaguelands; floating necropolis of Kel'Thuzad)  
- **O** – **Orgrimmar** (Durotar; capital of the Horde, carved into a canyon)  
- **P** – **Pyrewood Village** (Silverpine Forest; cursed Gilnean settlement by night, undead by dark)  
- **Q** – **Quel'Thalas** (Referenced; the high elven kingdom, though its borders (like Silvermoon) were not fully accessible, but **Quests** heavily referenced it, and **Quel’Danil Lodge** in Hinterlands was a high elven outpost)  
- **R** – **Redridge Mountains** (East of Elwynn; rugged terrain with Lakeshire and Blackrock orc threat)  
- **S** – **Silithus** (Southern Kalimdor; arid desert with the Scarab Wall, C'Thun cults)  
- **T** – **Tanaris** (Desert peninsula; home to Gadgetzan, Steamwheedle Cartel, and Zul'Farrak)  
- **U** – **Uldaman** (Badlands; Titan-forgotten ruins buried deep underground)  
- **V** – **The Veiled Sea** (Ocean west of Kalimdor; referenced in quests and sailing lore)  
- **W** – **Westfall** (West of Elwynn; lawless, bandit-ridden plains near Stormwind)  
- **X** – **X Marks the Spot** (Pirate-themed quest area in **Stranglethorn Vale**, referencing buried treasure sites)  
- **Y** – **Yojamba Isle** (Stranglethorn; island where players summoned Hakkar the Soulflayer)  
- **Z** – **Zul'Farrak** (Tanaris; desert troll city, featured in key dungeon questlines)

All locations are firmly rooted in **Vanilla WoW zones, dungeons, capitals, or major quest hubs**, with no reliance on expansion-era geography (e.g., no Outland, Northrend, Pandaria, etc.). "X" uses a canonical quest reference site within the original world. [end of text]
