Yo, listen up, let me break it down real simple,
The Fed, they the bosses, the main man, the big dipper,
They run the game, control the cash, keep the streets steady,
Make sure the paper flowin', no inflation, no dread.

They print the dough, set the rates, keep it tight,
Control the money supply, make sure the hustle right,
When the economy slow, they drop the rates,
Inject that cash, get the people spendin' straight.

But if it's too hot, too much money in the air,
They jack it up, raise rates, make sure it's fair,
Keep the balance, don't let it tip,
Too much cash, the value dip, the dollar slip.

They got tools, like open market, swap the bonds,
Adjust the discount rate, where the banks borrow funds,
They set the reserve req, how much cash banks hold,
Make sure the banks got back, keep the system bold.

They watch the就业, the jobs, the unemployment rate,
Make moves to keep the people working, keep the game straight,
They got meetings, FOMC, every few weeks,
Decide the future, make the call, no weak.

So when you hear the Fed, don't sleep, it's the key,
They steer the ship, keep the economy free,
From crash to boom, they the ones in the driver's seat,
Control the flow, make sure the streets don't cheat.

So next time you hear the term, you know who it be,
The Federal Reserve, the G, keepin' it G,
They the architects, the planners, the ones with the plan,
Keep the paper steady, make sure the hustle can. [end of text]
