Once upon a time, there were three little pigs. The first little pig was named Piggy 1, the second was Piggy 2, and the third was Piggy 3. They were all very different from each other.

Piggy 1 was a lazy pig who loved to sleep all day. He built his house out of straw, which was easy and quick for him. Piggy 2 was a smart pig who loved to read books. He built his house out of sticks, which was strong and sturdy. Piggy 3 was a hardworking pig who loved to play sports. He built his house out of bricks, which was the strongest and most durable.

One day, a big, bad wolf came along. He saw the three little pigs and decided he wanted to eat them. He started by blowing down Piggy 1's straw house. Piggy 1 was scared and ran away.

Next, the wolf blew down Piggy 2's stick house. Piggy 2 was also scared and ran away.

Finally, the wolf tried to blow down Piggy 3's brick house. But the wolf couldn't blow it down, no matter how hard he tried. So, he decided to climb up the chimney instead.

Piggy 3 was home, cooking dinner. He heard the wolf coming up the chimney and quickly grabbed a pot of boiling water. When the wolf came into the room, Piggy 3 threw the boiling water at him, burning his fur and making him run away.

From that day on, the three little pigs lived happily ever after in their brick house, safe from the big, bad wolf. And they all learned that hard work and determination can help you overcome any obstacle.
