Okay, imagine you're in a big school with lots and lots of students. Now, in China, there's a really big group of grown-ups called the National People's Congress. Think of them like a big class meeting, but for the whole country!

This group helps make important rules for the country, just like how your teacher helps make rules for your class. They listen to what people in China are saying and try to make sure everyone is safe, happy, and has what they need.

So, the National People's Congress is like a big team of grown-ups who help run the country and make sure everything works well for everyone in China. [end of text]
