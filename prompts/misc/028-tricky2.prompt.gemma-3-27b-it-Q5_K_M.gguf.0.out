Alice is fundamentally right. Water *typically* freezes at 0°C (32°F).

However, Bob is also technically right! While 0°C is the standard freezing point, water can be *supercooled* – meaning it can remain liquid below 0°C if there are no impurities to initiate crystallization. At -10°C, water *will* freeze *eventually*, but it doesn't *immediately* freeze just by reaching that temperature if it's been kept very pure and undisturbed. 

Bob is relying on this less common phenomenon to justify his statement. It's a bit of a trick!
