Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10 degrees Celsius, water is already frozen (solid ice), but it does not freeze at that temperature; it was frozen at 0Â°C and remains frozen at lower temperatures. Bob's statement is incorrect because it misrepresents the freezing point of water. [end of text]
