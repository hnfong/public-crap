### A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?

**Answer:**  
Yes, water can freeze at -12°C, but it depends on the conditions.  

**Explanation:**  
- Under normal atmospheric pressure (1 atm), pure water freezes at **0°C**.  
- However, if the water is **supercooled** (lacking impurities or nucleation sites), it can remain liquid below 0°C until it reaches -12°C or even lower before freezing spontaneously.  
- If the water is in a very pure state and free from disturbances, it might not freeze at -12°C unless disturbed (e.g., shaking or adding an ice crystal).  

### B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?  

**Answer:**  
The water may **freeze** or remain **supercooled** as a liquid, depending on conditions.  

**Explanation:**  
1. **If the water freezes:**  
   - At -12°C, most pure water would solidify into ice, assuming no supercooling.  
   - However, if the container is very clean and undisturbed, the water could **supercool** below 0°C and stay liquid.  

2. **If the water remains liquid (supercooled):**  
   - Supercooling occurs because there are no impurities or nucleation points to initiate freezing.  
   - Once the supercooled water is disturbed (e.g., by shaking or adding an ice crystal), it will rapidly freeze.  

**Conclusion:**  
- In practice, pure water in a smooth glass container might **not freeze at -12°C** due to supercooling.  
- If the water freezes, it would form **ice at -12°C**.
