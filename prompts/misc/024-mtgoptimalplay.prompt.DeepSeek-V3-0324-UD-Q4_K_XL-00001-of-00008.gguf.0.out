Alright, let's break down the scenario step by step to understand the optimal plays for both Alice and Bob in this Magic: The Gathering situation.

### Understanding the Cards and the Board State

**Alice's Hand:**
- Two copies of **Kindle**.
  - **Kindle** is an instant that deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards.

**Bob's Board:**
- **Orim, Samite Healer** (1/3 legendary creature).
  - Ability: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."
  - Orim is untapped and doesn't have summoning sickness (has been on board for a while).

**Other Information:**
- Alice has sufficient mana to cast any spells.
- Bob's lands are tapped out, meaning he can't generate additional mana this turn (so he can't cast spells or activate abilities that require mana, but Orim's ability doesn't require mana).
- Alice wants to kill Orim because it's a threat to her burn deck.

### Current Graveyard State:
- Initially, there are no Kindles in any graveyards (since none have been cast yet).
  - So, the first Kindle cast will deal 2 + 0 = 2 damage.

### Alice's Goal:
- Kill Orim (which has 3 toughness).
- She has two Kindles in hand.

### Possible Sequence of Plays:

1. **Alice casts the first Kindle targeting Orim:**
   - Damage calculation: 2 (base) + 0 (no Kindles in graveyard) = 2 damage.
   - Orim would go from 3 toughness to 1 (since 3 - 2 = 1).
   - After this Kindle resolves, it goes to Alice's graveyard.
   - Now, there's 1 Kindle in Alice's graveyard.

2. **Bob's Response:**
   - Before the first Kindle resolves, Bob can choose to activate Orim's ability to prevent damage.
   - Orim's ability is "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage to any target this turn."
   - Bob can tap Orim to prevent the next 3 damage to Orim this turn.
   - If he does this, the first Kindle's 2 damage is prevented (since it's the next damage, and 2 < 3).
   - After prevention, Orim takes 0 damage from the first Kindle.
   - Orim is now tapped (from using its ability).

3. **Alice's Second Kindle:**
   - Now, Alice casts the second Kindle targeting Orim.
   - Damage calculation: 2 (base) + 1 (one Kindle in graveyard) = 3 damage.
   - Orim is currently at 3 toughness, tapped (so can't use its ability again this turn).
   - The 3 damage is dealt to Orim, reducing its toughness to 0, thus destroying it.

### Alternative Scenario if Bob Doesn't Activate Orim's Ability:

1. **Alice casts first Kindle (2 damage):**
   - Orim goes from 3 to 1 toughness.
   - Kindle goes to graveyard.

2. **Alice casts second Kindle:**
   - Damage: 2 + 1 = 3 damage.
   - Orim is at 1, takes 3 damage, goes to -2, destroyed.

But in this case, Orim is already at 1 after the first Kindle, and the second Kindle deals 3, which is overkill. It's better for Alice to have Bob tap Orim in response to the first Kindle, making the second Kindle exactly lethal (3 damage to a 3-toughness Orim).

### Optimal Play for Both Players:

**Alice's Optimal Play:**
1. Cast the first Kindle targeting Orim (2 damage).
   - This forces Bob to decide whether to use Orim's ability.
   
2. If Bob taps Orim to prevent the 2 damage, then Alice casts the second Kindle for 3 damage, which kills Orim (since it's tapped and can't prevent again).
   
3. If Bob doesn't tap Orim, the first Kindle deals 2, second deals 3, killing Orim with overkill damage.

But the smarter play is to sequence it so that Bob has to tap Orim on the first Kindle, making the second Kindle exactly lethal.

**Bob's Optimal Play:**
- When Alice casts the first Kindle (2 damage), Bob should tap Orim to prevent that 2 damage.
  - This is because if he doesn't, Orim will take 2, then 3, and die.
  - By preventing the first 2, he forces Alice to use the second Kindle to deal 3, but he's already tapped Orim, so the 3 damage will kill it.
  - However, this is the best Bob can do; he can't save Orim because Alice has two Kindles.

If Bob doesn't tap Orim for the first Kindle, Orim dies to the two Kindles (2 then 3 damage). If he does tap, Orim still dies to the second Kindle (3 damage when tapped). So either way, Orim dies, but the sequence where Bob taps Orim on the first Kindle is more optimal because it minimizes the damage prevented (only prevents 2 instead of potentially preventing more if there were more spells).

But in this exact scenario, since Alice only has two Kindles, Orim is doomed either way. The optimal play is for Alice to cast both Kindles, and Bob to tap Orim in response to the first one, leading to Orim's death from the second Kindle.

### Final Outcome:

1. Alice casts Kindle targeting Orim (2 damage).
2. Bob responds by tapping Orim to prevent the next 3 damage this turn (so the 2 damage is prevented).
   - Orim is now tapped.
3. Alice casts the second Kindle targeting Orim.
   - Damage: 2 + 1 (one Kindle in graveyard) = 3 damage.
   - Orim is tapped, can't prevent this damage.
   - 3 damage is dealt to Orim (3 toughness), destroying it.

**Result:** Orim is destroyed.

### Thought Process Summary:

- **Alice's Perspective:**
  - Wants to ensure Orim is killed with the two Kindles.
  - Casting one Kindle forces Bob to decide whether to prevent damage.
  - If Bob prevents, the second Kindle will kill Orim since it's tapped.
  - If Bob doesn't prevent, the two Kindles will still kill Orim (2 then 3 damage).
  - The sequence ensures Orim's death regardless of Bob's choice.

- **Bob's Perspective:**
  - When the first Kindle is cast, preventing the 2 damage is better than not preventing, because:
    - If he doesn't prevent, Orim takes 2 then 3, dies.
    - If he prevents, Orim takes 0 then 3, dies.
    - Preventing at least saves Orim from the first 2 damage, but since Alice has a second Kindle, Orim is still doomed.
    - However, in some scenarios, preventing might save Orim if Alice didn't have enough damage, but here she does.

Given that Bob can't save Orim no matter what, his optimal play is to prevent the first Kindle's damage to minimize the damage taken (even though Orim still dies), because in other contexts, preventing damage could be crucial. But in this exact scenario, it doesn't change the outcome.

### Game Mechanics Notes:

- **Instant Speed:** Kindle is an instant, so Alice can cast it whenever she has priority.
- **Activated Abilities:** Orim's ability can be activated in response to Kindle being cast, before it resolves.
  - The ability doesn't require mana, only tapping Orim, which Bob can do even with tapped lands.
- **Damage Prevention:** Orim's ability creates a prevention shield for the next 3 damage this turn. The first Kindle's 2 damage is less than 3, so it's fully prevented.
- **Stack Resolution:**
  - Alice casts Kindle 1 (2 damage) -> Bob activates Orim's ability in response -> ability resolves (prevention shield) -> Kindle 1 resolves (2 damage prevented) -> Alice casts Kindle 2 (3 damage) -> no responses -> Kindle 2 resolves (3 damage to Orim, killing it).

### Conclusion:

The optimal play sequence is:

1. Alice casts the first Kindle targeting Orim (2 damage).
2. Bob responds by tapping
