Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Give me your interpretation. You do not have to translate the contents, but you may if you wish.
 [/INST]  The lyrics tell a whimsical story of a small restaurant in the forest, where the chef is a mischievous and talented cook who prepares a unique and delicious meal for the guests.

The story begins with the lines "ドングリを辿っても着きません" (Don't follow the dung, we won't get there), which suggests that the restaurant is hidden and not easily accessible. The next line, "森の小さなレストラン" (Small restaurant in the forest), confirms that the restaurant is located in a secluded area.
The following lines, "空っぽのポケットを弄って" (Playing with an empty pocket), "忘れた人から辿り着く" (Finding the way from a forgotten person), suggest that the guests often forget their reservations and have to search for the restaurant.
