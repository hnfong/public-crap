Here are the answers with brief explanations:

A) No, water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. 

B) If a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will likely remain in a liquid state, a phenomenon known as supercooling. This occurs because the water lacks nucleation sites for ice crystals to form. However, if the water is disturbed or if there are impurities present, it may suddenly freeze. [end of text]
