Once upon a time, in a magical forest, there lived a beautiful princess named Snow White. She was known for her kind heart and gentle nature. ðŸ˜Š

One day, while taking a stroll in the forest, Snow White stumbled upon a wicked queen who had been cursed by an evil witch. The queen had been transformed into a cruel and wicked version of herself, and she was determined to take Snow White's place as the princess.  Horror!

The wicked queen, jealous of Snow White's beauty and kindness, decided to take matters into her own hands. She cast a spell on Snow White, turning her into a beautiful but harmless white rabbit. rabbit_face

The wicked queen then took Snow White's place as the princess, and she began to rule the kingdom with an iron fist. But her cruel ways soon began to wear on her, and she longed for the kindness and love that Snow White had once shown her. ðŸ’ª

One day, the wicked queen stumbled upon a magical mirror that could reveal the truth about herself. She asked the mirror, "Who am I?" The mirror replied, "You are a wicked queen, who has been cursed by an evil witch."  mirror_face

The wicked queen realized that she had been living a lie, and she began to question her own actions. She decided to seek out the help of a wise old owl, who had lived in the forest for centuries.  owl_face

The wise owl listened to the wicked queen's story and told her that she had been given a second chance to make things right. He told her that she could break the curse by finding the magical flower that grew in the heart of the forest. flower_face
