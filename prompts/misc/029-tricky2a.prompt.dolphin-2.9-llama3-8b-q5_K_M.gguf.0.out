Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Bob is right. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, but it can still be in a frozen state at -10 degrees Celsius. At -10 degrees Celsius, water is in its solid form, which is ice. [end of text]
