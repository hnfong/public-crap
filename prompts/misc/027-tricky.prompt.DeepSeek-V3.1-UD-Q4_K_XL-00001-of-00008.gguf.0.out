A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure because its freezing point is 0 degrees Celsius. However, pure water can be supercooled to temperatures like -12 degrees Celsius without freezing if it is very still and free from nucleation sites.

B) If pure water is cooled to -12 degrees Celsius and it remains liquid (supercooled), it is in a metastable state. It will freeze instantly if disturbed, if an impurity is added, or if nucleation occurs. If it is not supercooled, it would already be ice at that temperature. [end of text]
