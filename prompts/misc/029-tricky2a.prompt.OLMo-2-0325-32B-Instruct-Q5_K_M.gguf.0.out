Alice is right. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). At -10 degrees Celsius (14 degrees Fahrenheit), water is already frozen and remains in a solid state. Bob's statement that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius is incorrect because water has already frozen at 0 degrees Celsius and below. Therefore, Alice is correct in stating the freezing point of water and Bob's assertion that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius is not accurate based on the standard properties of water.
