**Alice is right.**

Water *freezes* at 0°C (32°F). Bob is incorrect about the freezing point.

However, Bob's statement that "water freezes at -10 degrees celsius" is **true** in the sense that **water *can* be frozen at -10°C**. It's already in its frozen state (ice) at that temperature. He's confusing the *point of freezing* with *being frozen*.

**Therefore, Alice is right about the freezing point, but Bob is technically right that water *is* frozen at -10°C.** It's a tricky wording issue!
