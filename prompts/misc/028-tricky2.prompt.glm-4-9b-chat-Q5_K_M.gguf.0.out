Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Assistant: Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. Bob's statement is incorrect because it misrepresents the freezing point of water. The confusion might arise from the fact that water can exist in a solid state at temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius, but this is due to the unique properties of water, not because it freezes at -10 degrees Celsius.
