Bob is technically correct in the sense that he stated the temperature at which water freezes, which is -10 degrees Celsius. However, Alice is also correct in the context of standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere). Under normal conditions, water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). 

Bob's statement is a bit misleading because it implies that water can freeze at any temperature, which is not the case. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure. If the pressure is different, the freezing point can change. For example, at higher altitudes where the atmospheric pressure is lower, water can freeze at temperatures above 0 degrees Celsius. But for the general case at sea level, Alice's statement is the accurate one. [end of text]
