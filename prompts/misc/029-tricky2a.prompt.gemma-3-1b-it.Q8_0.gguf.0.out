Bob is right.

The statement “water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius” is a common misconception. Water *does* freeze at 0°C, but it doesn’t freeze at *exactly* 0°C. It undergoes a phase transition – it transitions from a liquid to a solid – and the freezing point is a bit lower. 

Alice’s point is that water’s freezing point is a bit more complex and depends on the pressure. [end of text]
