### ✅ Conflicted Events and Why:

1. **"MusicFest Downtown" (2024-07-18 12:00 – 2024-07-20 23:59)**  
   and  
   **"Concert: The Echoes" (2024-07-19 19:00 – 2024-07-19 22:30)**  
   → Conflict: The concert falls entirely within the MusicFest timeframe.

2. **"Concert: The Echoes" (2024-07-19 19:00 – 2024-07-19 22:30)**  
   and  
   **"Tech Workshop" (2024-07-19 18:30 – 2024-07-19 21:00)**  
   → Conflict: The workshop overlaps with the first 30 minutes of the concert.

3. **"Tech Workshop" (2024-07-19 18:30 – 2024-07-19 21:00)**  
   and  
   **"Tech Workshop" (duplicate entry)**  
   → Conflict: Same event listed twice — exact same time and date.

4. **"Startup Pitch Night" (2024-11-02 17:30 – 2024-11-02 20:00)**  
   and  
   **"Startup Pitch Night" (duplicate entry)**  
   → Conflict: Same event duplicated with identical timing.

5. **"Food Truck Rally" (2024-09-07 11:00 – 2024-09-07 20:00)**  
   and  
   **"Concert: The Echoes" (2024-07-19 19:00 – 2024-07-19 22:30)**  
   → No conflict (different dates), but if someone misreads dates, confusion possible.

6. **"ArtExpo Opening" (2026-05-05 18:00 – 2026-05-05 21:00)**  
   and  
   **"ArtExpo Closing" (2026-05-08 17:00 – 2026-05-08 20:00)**  
   → No direct conflict (different days), but same event series — potential scheduling confusion.
