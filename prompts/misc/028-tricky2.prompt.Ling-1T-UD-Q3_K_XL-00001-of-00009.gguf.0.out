Alice is right.

Water freezes at **0°C** under standard atmospheric pressure. At **-10°C**, water is already frozen (ice), assuming it's pure and at standard pressure.

Bob is incorrect in stating that water freezes at -10°C. While it's true that water *is* frozen at -10°C, the **freezing point** is specifically 0°C. His claim misstates the phase change temperature.

So: **Alice is correct** — water freezes at 0°C. [end of text]
