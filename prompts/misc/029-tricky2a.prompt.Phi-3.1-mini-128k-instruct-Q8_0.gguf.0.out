 Bob is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10 degrees Celsius, water would indeed be in a solid state, but it would not be considered 'frozen' in the typical sense, as it is well below the freezing point. The term 'freezes' is used to describe the transition from liquid to solid, which occurs at 0 degrees Celsius. [end of text]
