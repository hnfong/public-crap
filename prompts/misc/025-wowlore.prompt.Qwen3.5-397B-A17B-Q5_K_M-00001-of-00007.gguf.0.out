Here is a list of places from **original Vanilla World of Warcraft** lore (including locations accessible in the 1.12 "Drums of War" patch, but excluding content introduced in *The Burning Crusade*, *Wrath of the Lich King*, etc.), following your A-Z format:

*   **A** for **Azeroth** (The world itself, or specifically the Eastern Kingdoms continent often referred to by the name in early lore contexts).
*   **B** for **Blackrock Mountain** (The massive volcano housing Blackrock Spire, Blackrock Depths, and Molten Core).
*   **C** for **Capital City** (The ruins of Lordaeron's capital, located in Tirisfal Glades).
*   **D** for **Darnassus** (The Night Elf capital city on Teldrassil).
*   **E** for **Elwynn Forest** (The starting zone for Humans, home to Stormwind).
*   **F** for **Felwood** (The corrupted forest north of Ashenvale).
*   **G** for **Gnomeregan** (The technologically advanced, now-radioactive Gnome capital in Dun Morogh).
*   **H** for **Hillsbrad Foothills** (The contested zone between the Alliance and Horde in the south).
*   **I** for **Ironforge** (The Dwarven capital city inside the mountains of Dun Morogh).
*   **J** for **Janero's Homestead** (A small, named location in the Redridge Mountains, often cited in early quests). *Note: "J" is difficult in Vanilla; alternatively, one could use the **Jagged Wastes** (a sub-zone description in Desolace) or simply accept that few major zones start with J.* Let's go with **Jintha'Alor** (The troll city in the Arathi Highlands).
*   **K** for **Kalimdor** (The western continent).
*   **L** for **Loch Modan** (The dwarven valley zone known for its dam and lakes).
*   **M** for **Molten Core** (The elemental plane raid instance inside Blackrock Mountain).
*   **N** for **Nighthaven** (The central hub of Moonglade, accessible only by druids or the Lunar Festival).
*   **O** for **Orgrimmar** (The Orc capital city in Durotar).
*   **P** for **Plaguelands** (Referring to the Eastern and Western Plaguelands, the heart of the Scourge threat).
*   **Q** for **Quel'Thalas** (While the zone wasn't playable until TBC, the **ruins of Quel'Thalas** were frequently mentioned in Vanilla lore, books, and the backstory of the Blood Elves/Sin'dorei. However, for a strictly *visitable* location, **The Quarry** in Stonetalon Mountains is a specific named spot). Let's stick to lore-heavy: **Quel'Thalas** (as a referenced kingdom/region in lore books and quests).
*   **R** for **Redridge Mountains** (The zone connecting Elwynn Forest to the Burning Steppes).
*   **S** for **Stormwind** (The Human capital city).
*   **T** for **Tanaris** (The desert zone in southern Kalimdor, home to Gadgetzan and Zul'Farrak).
*   **U** for **Uldaman** (The ancient Titan vault dungeon in the Badlands).
*   **V** for **Valley of Trials** (The Orc starting area in Durotar).
*   **W** for **Wetlands** (The swampy zone in northern Eastern Kingdoms).
*   **X** for **Xavian** (The satyr-infested ruins in Ashenvale).
*   **Y** for **Yojamba Isle** (The Zandalar Troll hub located off the coast of Stranglethorn Vale, added in patch 1.7).
*   **Z** for **Zul'Gurub** (The Blood God Hakkar's temple raid in Stranglethorn Vale, added in patch 1.7). [end of text]
