A) Yes, water freezes at -12 degrees Celsius.  
Explanation: The freezing point of pure water is 0°C under standard atmospheric pressure. Since -12°C is below 0°C, water will freeze at this temperature.

B) If a glass of pure water is cooled to -12°C, it will freeze into ice.  
Explanation: Once the temperature drops below 0°C, the water molecules slow down and form a solid crystalline structure, turning the liquid water into ice. At -12°C, the water will be completely frozen. [end of text]
