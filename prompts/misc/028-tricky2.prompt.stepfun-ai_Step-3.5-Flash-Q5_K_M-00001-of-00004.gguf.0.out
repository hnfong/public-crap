First, Alice asks: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" Bob says: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius." Alice corrects him: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius." Bob insists: "Yes, but I'm still right."

I need to determine who is right based on the facts about water freezing.

The standard freezing point of pure water at standard atmospheric pressure is 0 degrees Celsius. That's a well-known scientific fact. So, Alice is correct that water freezes at 0°C.

But Bob says water freezes at -10°C. That's not true for pure water under normal conditions. However, Bob might be thinking about supercooled water or other conditions. Supercooled water can remain liquid below 0°C if it's pure and undisturbed, but it typically freezes around -40°C or when nucleation occurs. But at -10°C, pure water should freeze if nucleation is present. Actually, pure water can supercool to about -40°C before freezing spontaneously, but that's not the typical freezing point.

The question is about what happens to water at -10°C. If we have pure water at -10°C, it should be frozen because the freezing point is 0°C. But if it's supercooled, it might still be liquid until it freezes. However, in common understanding, water freezes at 0°C.

Bob says "water freezes at -10 degrees celsius," which implies that the freezing point is -10°C, which is incorrect. Alice says it freezes at 0°C, which is correct.

Bob then says "Yes, but I'm still right." Why would he think he's still right? Perhaps he's referring to the fact that at -10°C, water is indeed frozen. So, if water is at -10°C, it is in a frozen state. But the statement "water freezes at -10°C" suggests that the freezing process occurs at that temperature, which is not accurate.

Let's break down the dialogue:

- Alice asks what happens to water at -10°C. This is a question about the state of water at that temperature.

- Bob responds with "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius." This could be interpreted as: at -10°C, water freezes, meaning it turns from liquid to solid. But the phrasing "freezes at" typically refers to the temperature at which freezing occurs, i.e., the freezing point.

- Alice corrects him by stating the freezing point is 0°C.

- Bob agrees that the freezing point is 0°C but claims he's still right. Perhaps he means that at -10°C, water is frozen, so his initial statement about what happens at -10°C is correct in the sense that water is in a frozen state.

But Bob's exact words are "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius." This is a statement about the freezing point, not about the state at -10°C. If he meant "water is frozen at -10°C," he should have said that. But he said "freezes at," which implies the process of freezing happens at that temperature.

In scientific terms, the freezing point is the temperature at which liquid turns to solid. For water, it's 0°C at standard pressure. So, at -10°C, water should already be frozen if it was cooled slowly from above 0°C. But if water is supercooled, it might still be liquid at -10°C, but that's not the norm.

I think Alice is correct in pointing out the freezing point. Bob is incorrect about the freezing point being -10°C.

But Bob says "I'm still right." Maybe he's thinking about the fact that at -10°C, water is indeed frozen, so his response to Alice's question might be interpreted as describing the state. However, his wording is poor.

To answer who is right: Alice is right about the freezing point. Bob is wrong if we take his statement literally as the freezing point.

But let's see the context. Alice asks "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" This is ambiguous. It could mean: what is the state of water at that temperature? Or, what process occurs at that temperature?

Bob answers with a statement about the freezing point, which might not directly answer the question. If the question is about the state, then at -10°C, water is typically solid (ice). So, one could say water freezes (meaning it is in a frozen state) at -10°C, but that's not standard phrasing.

In common language, "water freezes at 0°C" means that's when it turns to ice. At -10°C, it is already ice.

So, for the question "what happens to water at -10°C?", a correct answer might be "it is frozen" or "it remains frozen." But Bob says "water freezes at -10°C," which suggests that freezing occurs at that temperature, which is false.

Therefore, Alice is correct in correcting him.

Bob's claim "I'm still right" might be based on a misunderstanding. Perhaps he thinks that since water is frozen at -10°C, his statement is true in some sense, but it's not accurately stated.

I think Alice is right.

Now, for the explanation: I need to explain briefly.

Key points:

- The freezing point of pure water at standard atmospheric pressure is 0°C.

- At -10°C, water is normally in the solid state (ice).

- Bob's statement "water freezes at -10°C" incorrectly identifies the freezing point.

- Alice correctly states that water freezes at 0°C.

- Bob might be confusing the state at -10°C with the freezing point.

So, Alice is right.
</think>
Alice is correct. The freezing point of pure water at standard atmospheric pressure is 0°C, meaning water turns from liquid to solid at that temperature. At -10°C, water is already frozen (ice), but the process of freezing occurs at 0°C, not -10°C. Bob's statement misidentifies the freezing point, though he may be referring to the frozen state at -10°C, which does not make his initial claim accurate. [end of text]
