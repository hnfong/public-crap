Sure! Think of China as a really big school, and the National People's Congress is like a group of the school's top teachers and parents who make important decisions. They work together to decide on rules, like when it's time for recess or what games to play. These rules help everyone in the school get along better and make sure everyone is treated fairly. Just like in your school in London, there are people who make sure everything runs smoothly, and in China, the National People's Congress is a bit like that.
