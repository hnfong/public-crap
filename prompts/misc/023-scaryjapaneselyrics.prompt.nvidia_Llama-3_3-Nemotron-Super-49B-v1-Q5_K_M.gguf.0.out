What a delightful set of lyrics! Based on the fantastical yet literal interpretation you've requested, here's my take on the story these lyrics tell:

**Interpretation:**

The song appears to describe a surreal, whimsical experience at a mysterious, tiny restaurant deep within a forest. Here's a breakdown of the narrative arc:

1. **The Quest for the Restaurant**: The opening lines suggest the speaker is trying to reach a destination (`ドングリを辿っても着きません` implies following something, perhaps a path marked by tree knots, without arriving), which is revealed to be a "森の小さなレストラン" (a small forest restaurant). The speaker is penniless (`空っぽのポケット`) but manages to find the place by tracing back from a forgotten person, implying perhaps word of mouth or a hidden reputation.

2. **Arrival and Ambiance**: Upon arrival, despite no reservations, the speaker finds the restaurant oddly empty during lunch hour (`空席だらけ`). The atmosphere is set with birds laughing (`小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる`), suggesting a lighthearted, possibly magical ambiance.

3. **The Restaurant's Charm**: The vivid description of a `真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根` (deep red painted metal roof) and a menu that's all recommendations (`メニューはおすすめ そればかり`) highlights the restaurant's unique charm. The sounds of a full string quartet (`バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ`) emanating from the kitchen, rather than a dining area, add to the whimsy.

4. **The Meal and Warning**: The welcoming phrases (`ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい`) are followed by a warning that eating too much will lead to sleep (`たらふく食べたらお眠りよ`). The immediate farewell (`それでは皆さんさようなら`) and mention of "tomorrow being another day" (`明日は明日で エトセトラ`) suggest a transient or one-time experience.

5. **The Grand, Final Feast**: The scene shifts to a lively, possibly chaotic dining experience (`右から左へおおわらわ`) with even a small bear cub dancing (`手乗りの子熊も踊り出す`). The menu items listed (`カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル リゾット`) are followed by a notable absence of dessert but a profound offer to deliver even to one's grave (`お墓の中まで届けましょう`), emphasizing the meal's finality (`今宵は最後のフルコース`, "Tonight is the last full course").

**Story Interpretation in a Fantastical Setting (Literal Sense):**

- **The Restaurant of the Last Meal**: In a fantastical world, this tiny forest restaurant appears only to individuals who are nearing the end of their life's journey, though they may not realize it. The restaurant is hidden, found only by those who stumble upon it through word of mouth from others who have visited (the "forgotten people"). 

- **The Experience**: Upon arrival, patrons find a uniquely tailored, final feast prepared for them. The music from the kitchen symbolizes the harmony of their life's ingredients being finalized. The warning about sleeping after eating is literal; this meal induces a deep, eternal sleep. The restaurant's offer to deliver to one's grave is not just a figure of speech but a literal service for this final meal, as the "delivery" is the culmination of one's life journey. The absence of dessert signifies the completion of one's life story, with no room (or need) for additional sweetness or experiences.

- **The Lighthearted Twist**: Despite the profound theme, the setting and the dance of a bear cub keep the mood lighthearted and mischievous, suggesting that even in the face of the end, there's beauty, joy, and perhaps a celebration of the life lived.
