### Conflicts Detected:

After analyzing the events, here are the **conflicting events** and the reasons why they conflict:

1. **New Yearâ€™s Eve Party (2023-12-31, 20:00 â€“ 2024-01-01, 02:00)**  
   **Conflict with:** *New Yearâ€™s Eve Countdown (2023-12-31, 22:00 â€“ 2024-01-01, 01:00)*  
   **Why:** The New Yearâ€™s Eve Party starts at 20:00 on Dec 31, 2023, and ends at 02:00 on Jan 1, 2024. The Countdown event runs from 22:00 to 01:00 on the same day. Since the Countdown overlaps with the Party (22:00â€“01:00), they **conflict** in time and likely location (both are New Yearâ€™s Eve events).

2. **AI Innovation Summit (2023-12-01, 09:00 â€“ 2023-12-03, 17:00)**  
   **Conflict with:** *International Film Festival (2023-09-15, 11:00 â€“ 2023-09-25, 23:00)*  
   **Wait â€” no conflict here.** These are on different dates (Sep vs Dec). So **no conflict**.

3. **Music Festival (2023-08-12, 13:00 â€“ 2023-08-14, 22:00)**  
   **Conflict with:** *Tech Hackathon (2023-09-08, 08:00 â€“ 2023-09-09, 20:00)*  
   **No conflict** â€” different dates.

4. **Summer Music Festival (2024-07-10, 15:00 â€“ 2024-07-12, 23:00)**  
   **Conflict with:** *Tech Hackathon (2023-09-08, 08:00 â€“ 2023-09-09, 20:00)*  
   **No conflict** â€” different years.

5. **Annual Tech Conference (2023-05-15, 09:00 â€“ 2023-05-17, 17:00)**  
   **Conflict with:** *University Graduation Ceremony (2023-05-12, 10:00 â€“ 2023-05-12, 13:00)*  
   **No conflict** â€” different dates.

6. **AI Innovation Summit (2023-12-01, 09:00 â€“ 2023-12-03, 17:00)**  
   **Conflict with:** *New Yearâ€™s Eve Party (2023-12-31, 20:00 â€“ 2024-01-01, 02:00)*  
   **No conflict** â€” different dates.

âœ… **Only one confirmed conflict:**

- **New Yearâ€™s Eve Party (2023-12-31 20:00 â€“ 2024-01-01 02:00)**  
  **vs**  
  **New Yearâ€™s Eve Countdown (2023-12-31 22:00 â€“ 2024-01-01 01:00)**

ðŸ‘‰ **Conflict Reason:** The Countdown event occurs **entirely within** the time window of the New Yearâ€™s Eve Party (22:00â€“01:00 on Dec 31, 2023). Since both are likely held at the same venue or require similar resources (e.g., crowd management, security, stage), they **conflict** in time and space.

---

### âœ… Final Answer:
**Only one conflict exists:**
- **New Yearâ€™s Eve Party** and **New Yearâ€™s Eve Countdown** overlap between **22:00 and 01:00 on December 31, 2023**, making them incompatible if they are meant to occur at the same location or require shared resources. [end of text]
