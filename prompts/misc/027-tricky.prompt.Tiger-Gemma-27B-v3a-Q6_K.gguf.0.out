Here are the answers with brief explanations:

**A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?**

No. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) at standard pressure. -12 degrees Celsius is *below* the freezing point, meaning it would already be frozen *if* it could freeze at that temperature.

**B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?**

The water will freeze into ice. At 0°C, it transitions from liquid to solid. Cooling it further to -12°C simply means the ice will be colder, but it will remain solid.  It won't change state again unless heated.
