Okay, here are the answers to your questions with brief explanations:

**A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?**

Yes. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit), not -12 degrees Celsius. -12°C is well below the freezing point.

**B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?**

The water will freeze. At -12°C, the water molecules will slow down and arrange themselves into a crystalline structure – ice. It will transition from a liquid to a solid state. 


Do you want me to elaborate on any of these points, or would you like to ask another question? [end of text]
