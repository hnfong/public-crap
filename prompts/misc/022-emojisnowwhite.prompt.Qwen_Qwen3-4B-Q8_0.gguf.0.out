👧👧👧👧👧  

🌸✨🌸✨🌸  
👧 walks through 🌲 with 🌟 in her hair.  
She is 🌸, pure and bright, with skin like ❄️.  
She sings to 🦊, who is not evil, but kind.  
They dance in the moonlight, 🌕.  

👑 comes with a 🦔, but the 🦔 is not bad.  
He is a 🦔 who loves 🌸.  
He gives her a 💎, but it is not a curse.  
It is a gift from the 🌟.  

The 🦊 is not a villain, but a 🦊 who is lost.  
He is not evil, but a 🦊 who is sad.  
He is not a monster, but a 🦊 who is kind.  

🌸✨🌸✨🌸  
👧 is not like the others.  
She is not a princess, but a 🌸.  
She is not a queen, but a 🌸.  
She is not a fairy, but a 🌸.  

👑 is not a king, but a 🦔.  
He is not a ruler, but a 🦔.  
He is not a monster, but a 🦔.  
He is not a villain, but a 🦔.  

🌸✨🌸✨🌸  
👧 and 🦔 live together in a 🌳.  
They sing and dance, and the 🌟 shines.  
The 🦊 is not a villain, but a 🦊.  
He is not a monster, but a 🦊.  

🌸✨🌸✨🌸  
The end. 🌈✨ [end of text]
