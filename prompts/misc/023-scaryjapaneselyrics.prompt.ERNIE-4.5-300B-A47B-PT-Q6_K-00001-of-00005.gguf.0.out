The lyrics paint a whimsical, fantastical scene centered around a mysterious, secluded restaurant deep in the forest. Here's a literal interpretation of the story:

**The Enchanted Forest Restaurant**  
There’s a tiny, hidden restaurant in the woods that can’t be reached by following acorns (ドングリを辿っても着きません)—it’s a place only accessible to those who’ve forgotten something (忘れた人から辿り着く), suggesting it appears to the lost or those with a gap in their memory. The restaurant has no reservations (予約は一つもありません) and is eerily empty during lunchtime (空席だらけのランチ時), yet birds flutter around laughing (小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる), implying a magical, lively atmosphere despite the lack of human patrons.  

The building has a corrugated iron roof painted bright red (真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根), and the menu offers only "recommended" dishes (メニューはおすすめ そればかり), hinting at a lack of choice or perhaps a set, fateful meal. From the kitchen, classical music drifts out—violin, flute, cello, viola (バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ)—suggesting the restaurant itself is alive or enchanted, with the music perhaps being played by unseen spirits or magical entities.  

The host welcomes guests warmly (ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい) but warns that after eating heartily (たらふく食べたら), they’ll fall into a deep sleep (お眠りよ). The farewell (それでは皆さんさようなら) is casual, almost dismissive, with a promise to meet again "tomorrow and so on" (明日は明日で エトセトラ), implying a cyclical or timeless nature to the place.  

Chaos erupts as patrons (or perhaps the restaurant’s inhabitants) rush from right to left (右から左へおおわらわ), and even a hand-sized baby bear starts dancing (手乗りの子熊も踊り出す). The dishes served—carpaccio, paella, hors d'oeuvres, risotto (カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル リゾット)—are luxurious, but there’s no dessert (デザートはありません), suggesting the meal is incomplete or intentionally lacking sweetness.  

The most ominous line is the promise to deliver the meal "even to the grave" (お墓の中まで届けましょう), followed by the declaration that tonight’s meal is the "final full course" (今宵は最後のフルコース). This implies the restaurant feeds not just the living but the dead, or that those who eat here may not survive the night—or perhaps the meal is a metaphor for a final, transformative experience before passing on.  

### **Literal Fantastical Interpretation**:  
The song tells the story of a magical, possibly haunted restaurant in the woods that appears only to those who’ve lost something (memory, direction, or purpose). The establishment is run by unseen forces (birds, musical instruments, a dancing bear) and serves a lavish but incomplete meal that induces sleep—or worse. The "final full course" suggests the restaurant is a place of transition, where guests are either fed one last time before death or undergo a supernatural transformation. The cheerful melody contrasts with the dark undertones, creating a mischievous, fairy-tale-like atmosphere where nothing is quite as it seems. [end of text]
