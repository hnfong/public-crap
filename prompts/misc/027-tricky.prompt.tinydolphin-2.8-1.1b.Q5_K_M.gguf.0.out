A) Yes, water freezes at -12 degrees Celsius.

B) When you cool down a glass of pure water to -12 degrees Celsius, it will turn into a liquid. This is because water molecules have lost their water vapor and are now in a solid state. The temperature of the water will decrease, causing it to lose its ability to vaporize and turn back into a liquid. [end of text]
