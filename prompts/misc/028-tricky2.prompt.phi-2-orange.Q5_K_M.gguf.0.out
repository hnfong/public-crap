Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). At -10 degrees Celsius, water is indeed in a solid state, but it is called "frost" or "ice." The freezing point of water is a well-known fact in science, and it is essential to understand the properties of water at different temperatures.

At -10 degrees Celsius, water molecules slow down and form a crystalline structure, which is why it turns into ice. This is also the temperature at which water expands when it freezes, which is why ice floats on water.

It's important to note that the freezing point of water can vary slightly depending on the pressure and impurities present in the water. However, at standard atmospheric pressure, water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius. [end of text]
