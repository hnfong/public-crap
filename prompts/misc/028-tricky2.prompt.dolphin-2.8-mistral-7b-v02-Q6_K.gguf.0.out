Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is right. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, not -10 degrees Celsius. The temperature at which water freezes is 0 degrees Celsius, and it turns into ice. The misconception might arise from the fact that water can still be liquid at -10 degrees Celsius, but it is not frozen yet. [end of text]
