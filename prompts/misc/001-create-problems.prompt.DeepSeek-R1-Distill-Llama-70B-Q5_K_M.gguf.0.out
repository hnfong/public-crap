Okay, so I need to create a set of 8 evaluation questions for LLMs based on the given constraints. Let me go through each requirement step by step to make sure I cover everything.

First, the questions must be concise, no long-winded ones. They should be within a paragraph or two. That means each question should be straightforward and to the point without unnecessary fluff.

Next, the difficulty level should increase from Q1 to Q8. Q1 should be easy, and each subsequent question should be harder. I need to ensure that each question builds on the previous one in terms of complexity.

The questions can be in English or Chinese, and ideally, there should be a mix to test multi-lingual capabilities. So I should include both languages, maybe alternating or distributing them across the 8 questions.

The topics should span a wide range of subjects. I should cover different areas like technology, science, history, culture, etc., to test the model's versatility.

There needs to be an objective way to assess the results. The answers can be open-form or multiple-choice, but no long essays. Short essays might be acceptable, but I should avoid anything too lengthy.

Creativity is key here. I need to think outside the box, especially with the constraints on including specific characters in the questions. For English questions, each must contain at least one "z" word, and for Chinese, each must include "平". This adds a layer of challenge but also forces me to be more inventive.

Looking at the example provided, Q0 is in English with a "z" word and includes multiple possible answers. I should follow that structure, providing clear questions and suggesting possible answers where appropriate.

Let me start brainstorming topics and questions, ensuring each meets the criteria. I'll alternate between English and Chinese to mix languages. I'll also make sure each question includes the required character and that the difficulty increases as I go along.

For Q1, I'll start with an easy English question about a zodiac sign. That's simple and fits the "z" requirement. Then, for Q2, maybe a Chinese question about a historical figure using "平". I'll continue this pattern, increasing the difficulty each time.

I need to ensure that each question is self-contained and doesn't require prior knowledge beyond general understanding. The answers should be verifiable, so the evaluation can be objective.

I'll also make sure that the topics are diverse. For example, after zodiac signs and historical figures, I can move to science, literature, technology, and so on. This way, the evaluation tests the model's knowledge across various domains.

I should also consider the structure of the questions. Some can be multiple-choice, while others can be open-ended. This variety will test different response capabilities of the LLM.

Now, putting it all together, I'll draft each question, ensuring they meet all the constraints and progressively increase in difficulty. I'll include the necessary characters and provide answer keys where applicable.

Finally, I'll review each question to ensure clarity and conciseness, making adjustments as needed to maintain the flow and difficulty curve from Q1 to Q8.
