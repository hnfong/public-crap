Let's break down the conversation to determine who is right:

1. **Alice's first statement**: "What happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius?"  
   - This is a question asking about the state of water at -10°C.

2. **Bob's response**: "Water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius."  
   - This is incorrect in a general sense because pure water at standard pressure freezes at 0°C, not -10°C. However, Bob could be implying that water *exists as ice* (i.e., is frozen) at -10°C, which is true.

3. **Alice's correction**: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius."  
   - This is correct regarding the freezing point of water under standard conditions.

4. **Bob's reply**: "Yes, but I'm still right."  
   - Bob is acknowledging that water freezes at 0°C, but he is also asserting that his original statement is correct in the sense that water *is frozen* (already in ice form) at -10°C.

### Who is right?
- **Alice is correct** that water freezes (transitions from liquid to solid) at 0°C under standard conditions.
- **Bob is also correct** in the sense that water at -10°C would already be frozen (ice), as the temperature is below the freezing point. His phrasing was ambiguous but not entirely wrong.

### Conclusion:
Both are right in different ways. Alice is correct about the freezing point (0°C), and Bob is correct that water at -10°C is frozen (ice). The confusion arises from the phrasing: "freezes at" vs. "is frozen at." [end of text]
