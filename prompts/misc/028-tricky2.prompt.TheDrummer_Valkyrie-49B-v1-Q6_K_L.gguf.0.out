A classic debate!

Both Alice and Bob are partially correct, but Alice is more accurate in this context. Here's why:

* Alice is right that water typically freezes at 0°C (32°F) under standard atmospheric pressure. This is the standard freezing point of water.
* Bob is technically correct in a broader sense. While pure water freezes at 0°C, the freezing point can be lowered by:
	+ Adding solutes (e.g., salt, alcohol) to create a solution (e.g., brine, alcoholic drinks). 
	+ Increasing pressure (e.g., in deep ocean trenches).
	+ Supercooling water (briefly keeping water liquid below 0°C without ice formation).

However, without any of these special conditions, water will indeed freeze at 0°C. Since the conversation doesn't mention any of these exceptions, Alice's straightforward answer is the most appropriate response.

So, in summary: Alice is right for typical conditions, while Bob's statement, although not entirely wrong, is misleading without additional context. [end of text]
