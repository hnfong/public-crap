Alice is correct in stating that water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. However, Bob is also technically correct in a broader context. 

At -10 degrees Celsius, any water that is already frozen will remain in its solid state (ice). If the water was initially liquid and the temperature is lowered to -10 degrees Celsius, it would have frozen at 0 degrees Celsius and then remained frozen as the temperature continued to drop. Therefore, at -10 degrees Celsius, water is indeed in a frozen state, which aligns with Bob's statement. 

In summary, both are right in their own way: Alice is correct about the freezing point, and Bob is correct about the state of water at -10 degrees Celsius. [end of text]
