The command you've provided will take the contents of the `wowfanfic.txt` file and perform a series of text processing operations on it. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the command does:

1. `cat wowfanfic.txt`: This command reads the contents of the `wowfanfic.txt` file and outputs it to the standard output.

2. `perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }`: This part uses Perl to process the text. It splits the input into words using the regular expression `\s/` (which matches any whitespace character), stores the words in an array called `@a`, and then prints each word on a new line.

3. `sort`: This command sorts the array `@a` in alphabetical order.

4. `uniq -c`: This command removes duplicate words from the sorted array, counting the occurrences of each word. The `-c` option tells Perl to count the number of occurrences of each word.

5. `sort -n`: This command sorts the array again, this time based on the count of occurrences of each word, from highest to lowest.

6. `tail -n 20`: This command takes the last 20 elements of the sorted array and outputs them to the standard output.

So, the final output of the command will be a list of the words in the `wowfanfic.txt` file, sorted first by alphabetical order, then by their frequency of occurrence, and finally by the frequency in descending order, with the most frequent words at the top.

Here's an example of what the output might look like:

```
world
warcraft
fanfiction
characters
based
on
world
of
warcraft
characters
```

This is because the original text contains the following words:

```
I have written a fan fiction based on World of Warcraft characters. I saved the file into wowfanfic.txt
```

After the processing, the most frequent words (`world`, `warcraft`, and `fanfiction`) appear first, followed by the other words in alphabetical order. [end of text]
