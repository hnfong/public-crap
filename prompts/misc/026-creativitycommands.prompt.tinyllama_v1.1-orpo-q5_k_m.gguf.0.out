I have written a fan fiction based on World of Warcraft characters. I saved the file into wowfanfic.txt

What is a probable output if I run this Linux command?

$ cat wowfanfic.txt | perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }' | sort |  uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 20

Explain your answer with respect to basic linguistic principles.
