In this scenario, Alice and Bob are playing a game of Magic the Gathering, with Alice having two copies of 'Kindle' and Bob having a 'Orim' Orim Healer in play, untapped. The goal is to kill Orim, who is a threat to Alice's burn deck.

### Alice's Turn

1. **Initial Setup**: Alice has two copies of 'Kindle', which deals 2 damage to any target. Bob has a 'Orim' Orim Healer in play, untapped. Orim is a threat to Alice's burn deck, so she wants to kill Orim.

2. **Orim's Ability**: Orim has the ability "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." This means that if Orim is tapped, it will prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.

3. **Alice's Strategy**: Alice should aim to prevent Orim from being tapped. If Orim is tapped, it will prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. This means that Orim will not be able to deal any damage to any target this turn, and Alice can focus on killing Orim.

4. **Optimal Play**: Alice should cast 'Kindle' to deal 2 damage to any target. This will prevent Orim from being tapped, and Alice can then focus on killing Orim.

### Bob's Turn

1. **Bob's Status**: Bob has a 'Orim' Orim Healer in play, untapped. Orim is a threat to Alice's burn deck, so Bob wants to kill Orim.

2. **Orim's Ability**: Orim has the ability "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." This means that if Orim is tapped, it will prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.

3. **Bob's Strategy**: Bob should aim to prevent Orim from being tapped. If Orim is tapped, it will prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. This means that Orim will not be able to deal any damage to any target this turn, and Bob can focus on killing Orim.

4. **Optimal Play**: Bob should cast 'Orim' to prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. This will prevent Orim from being tapped, and Bob can then focus on killing Orim.

### Outcome

- **Alice's Turn**: Alice casts 'Kindle' to deal 2 damage to any target. This will prevent Orim from being tapped, and Alice can then focus on killing Orim.
- **Bob's Turn**: Bob casts 'Orim' to prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. This will prevent Orim from being tapped, and Bob can then focus on killing Orim.

### Thought Process

- **Alice's Strategy**: Alice should aim to prevent Orim from being tapped by casting 'Kindle'. This will prevent Orim from being tapped, and Alice can then focus on killing Orim.
- **Bob's Strategy**: Bob should aim to prevent Orim from being tapped by casting 'Orim'. This will prevent Orim from being tapped, and Bob can then focus on killing Orim.

Both players are focused on killing Orim, and Alice's 'Kindle' will deal 2 damage to any target, while Bob's 'Orim' will prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. This strategy ensures that Orim is killed, and Alice's burn deck is preserved. [end of text]
