Okay, so I need to figure out how to approach this problem. The user wants me to perform a semantic "grep" on a given input based on a specific query. The query is to find lines that contain dialog or spoken text. 

First, I should understand what "semantic grep" means. It's not just a simple text search but rather understanding the context to determine if a line contains dialogue. So, I need to look for lines where characters are speaking or there are direct quotes.

Looking at the input, it's a mix of Chinese text and some English. Each line is numbered, and I need to check each one. The output should include the line number and the line itself if it matches, followed by "---" as a separator.

I'll go through each line one by one. Lines 1 to 3 don't have any quotes or dialogue. Line 4 has 「轟隆！」 which is an onomatopoeia, not dialogue. Line 6 is a narrative, so no. Line 8 has a quote 「啊～！」 and some dialogue, so that's a match. 

Continuing, line 12 is another onomatopoeia. Line 21 is narrative. Line 27 has a quote, so that's a match. Line 29 has dialogue from a black-clothed person. Line 33 is narrative but includes a sound effect, not dialogue. Line 39 has a question, so that's dialogue. Line 46 has a line spoken by someone. Line 50 is the black-clothed woman speaking. 

I need to make sure I don't miss any lines with quotes or spoken words. Each time I find one, I'll note the line number and the text, then add "---" after each. If no lines match, I should output nothing, but in this case, there are several matches.

I should double-check each line to ensure I'm not including any that are just narrative or descriptions without dialogue. Once I've gone through all lines, I'll compile the results as specified.
