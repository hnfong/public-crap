The song tells the story of a whimsical, magical restaurant hidden deep within a forest. 

**Literal Interpretation:**

* **The Journey:** The lyrics describe a journey to find this hidden restaurant, "following acorns" which suggests a trail of clues. The speaker arrives with empty pockets, implying they have nothing to offer but their presence.
* **The Restaurant:** The restaurant is small and seemingly deserted, with no reservations and empty tables. Yet, it's bustling with life, with birds laughing and music emanating from the kitchen.
* **The Menu:** The menu is simple, with only one recommended dish. The music from the kitchen suggests a lively, almost orchestral, atmosphere.
* **The Experience:** Guests are welcomed warmly and encouraged to eat until they fall asleep. The farewell is casual, hinting at a cyclical nature, "tomorrow is tomorrow."
* **The Feast:** A grand feast ensues, with dishes like carpaccio, paella, and appetizers. Notably, there's no dessert, and the food is even delivered "to the graveyard," suggesting a connection to the afterlife or a blurring of boundaries between life and death.

**Fantastical Elements:**

The song blends reality with fantasy. The talking birds, the music from the kitchen, and the delivery of food to graves suggest a magical realism where the ordinary is infused with the extraordinary.

**Possible Themes:**

* **The Power of Food:** The restaurant offers more than just sustenance; it provides an experience that transcends the physical, blurring the lines between life and death.
* **Community and Belonging:** The welcoming atmosphere and the shared feast suggest a sense of community and belonging, even in the afterlife.
* **Acceptance of Mortality:** The delivery of food to graves could symbolize acceptance of death as a natural part of life.

The song's lighthearted and mischievous tone suggests that even in the face of mortality, there is room for joy, celebration, and a sense of wonder. [end of text]
