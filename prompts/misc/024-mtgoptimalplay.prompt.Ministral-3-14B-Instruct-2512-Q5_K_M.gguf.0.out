Alright, let's break down this scenario step by step to determine the optimal plays for both Alice and Bob. Here's the situation again for clarity:

### Current State:
- **Alice's Hand:** Two copies of *Kindle*.
- **Bob's Hand:** Empty.
- **Board:**
  - Bob has *Orim, Samite Healer* in play, untapped.
    - *Orim* has the ability: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."
- **Other Notes:**
  - Orim has been on the board for a while (no summoning sickness).
  - Alice has sufficient mana to cast any spells.
  - Bob's lands are tapped out (he can't cast spells or activate abilities that require mana unless he has mana available, which he doesn't in this case).

### Objective:
Alice wants to kill Orim. Orim's ability can prevent up to 3 damage from being dealt to any target this turn if Bob taps Orim to activate it.

### Alice's Options:
Alice has two *Kindle* cards in hand. *Kindle* is an instant that deals damage equal to "2 plus the number of cards named *Kindle* in all graveyards."

Initially, there are no *Kindle* cards in any graveyards, so each *Kindle* deals 2 damage (2 + 0).

Alice can cast one or both *Kindle* spells. Let's explore the possibilities:

#### Option 1: Cast One *Kindle*
- Alice casts one *Kindle*, targeting Orim.
  - Damage dealt: 2 (since no *Kindle* is in the graveyard yet).
  - Orim's toughness is 3, so after taking 2 damage, Orim has 1 toughness left.
- Now, Orim is at 1 toughness. Bob can choose to tap Orim to activate its ability to prevent the next 3 damage this turn.
  - If Bob taps Orim, the next damage dealt to Orim this turn is prevented up to 3.
- Alice can then cast the second *Kindle*:
  - Now, one *Kindle* is in the graveyard (the first one just cast), so the second *Kindle* deals 2 + 1 = 3 damage.
  - Orim's ability is active (prevents next 3 damage), so the 3 damage is fully prevented.
  - Orim's toughness remains at 1 (since 3 damage is prevented).
- Outcome: Orim is not killed. Alice has spent both *Kindle* spells for no effect.

#### Option 2: Cast Both *Kindle* Simultaneously
- Alice can cast both *Kindle* spells at the same time (since they're instants, they can be cast in the same turn, even in the same main phase if desired).
  - When both are cast, the first *Kindle* goes on the stack, then the second.
  - The second *Kindle* resolves first (since it's on top of the stack), then the first.
    - Wait, no: in Magic, when multiple spells are cast in the same turn, the one cast last resolves first. So if Alice casts *Kindle* 1, then *Kindle* 2, *Kindle* 2 resolves first, then *Kindle* 1.
    - But actually, the order is determined by the order they're put on the stack. If Alice casts them in sequence, the second one is on top and resolves first.
    - However, the damage dealt by each *Kindle* is determined by the number of *Kindle* in graveyards at the time the spell resolves.
    - When the second *Kindle* resolves:
      - No *Kindle* is in the graveyard yet (since neither has resolved).
      - So it deals 2 damage.
      - Orim's toughness is 3, so now it's at 1.
    - Then the first *Kindle* resolves:
      - Now, one *Kindle* (the second one) is in the graveyard (since it just resolved).
      - So it deals 2 + 1 = 3 damage.
      - Orim's ability can prevent up to 3 damage this turn. If Bob hasn't tapped Orim yet, he can do so now to prevent this damage.
        - If Bob taps Orim before the first *Kindle* resolves, the 3 damage is prevented.
        - Orim's toughness remains at 1.
    - Outcome: Orim is not killed. Alice has spent both *Kindle* for no effect.

Wait, this seems similar to Option 1. Maybe there's a better way.

#### Option 3: Cast One *Kindle*, Then Cast the Second *Kindle* After Orim's Ability is Exhausted
- Alice casts one *Kindle*, targeting Orim:
  - Deals 2 damage (no *Kindle* in graveyard).
  - Orim's toughness: 3 → 1.
- Bob can tap Orim to activate its ability, preventing the next 3 damage this turn.
- Alice then casts the second *Kindle*:
  - Now, one *Kindle* is in the graveyard (the first one just cast), so this *Kindle* deals 3 damage.
  - Orim's ability is active, preventing up to 3 damage.
    - The 3 damage is fully prevented.
    - Orim's toughness remains at 1.
- Outcome: Orim is not killed.

Hmm, same as before. Maybe Alice can't kill Orim with two *Kindle* if Bob plays optimally.

Wait, is there a way to sequence the spells differently?

#### Option 4: Cast Both *Kindle* at the Same Time (Same Instant Speed)
- Alice can cast both *Kindle* spells simultaneously (since they're instants, they can be cast at the same time, which is equivalent to casting them in the same instant speed window).
  - When both are cast at the same time, they go on the stack in the order they're declared (assuming Alice declares them in order: *Kindle* 1, then *Kindle* 2).
  - The second *Kindle* resolves first (since it's on top), then the first.
    - Second *Kindle* resolves:
      - No *Kindle* in graveyard yet.
      - Deals 2 damage.
      - Orim: 3 → 1.
    - First *Kindle* resolves:
      - Now, one *Kindle* (the second one) is in the graveyard.
      - Deals 3 damage.
      - Orim's ability can prevent up to 3 damage this turn. If Bob hasn't tapped Orim yet, he can do so now to prevent this damage.
        - If Bob taps Orim before the first *Kindle* resolves, the 3 damage is prevented.
        - Orim's toughness remains at 1.
    - Outcome: Orim is not killed.

Same as before. It seems that with two *Kindle*, Alice cannot kill Orim if Bob plays optimally by tapping Orim to prevent the second *Kindle*'s damage.

But wait, is there a way to sequence the spells so that the first *Kindle* goes to the graveyard before the second resolves?

#### Option 5: Cast One *Kindle*, Then Cast the Second *Kindle* After the First Resolves
- Alice casts one *Kindle*, targeting Orim:
  - Deals 2 damage (no *Kindle* in graveyard).
  - Orim: 3 → 1.
- First *Kindle* resolves and goes to the graveyard.
- Now, one *Kindle* is in the graveyard.
- Alice then casts the second *Kindle*:
  - Now, one *Kindle* is in the graveyard, so this *Kindle* deals 3 damage.
  - Orim's ability can prevent up to 3 damage this turn. If Bob hasn't tapped Orim yet, he can do so now to prevent this damage.
    - If Bob taps Orim before the second *Kindle* resolves, the 3 damage is prevented.
    - Orim's toughness remains at 1.
- Outcome: Orim is not killed.

Still the same. It seems that with two *Kindle*,
