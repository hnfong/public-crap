Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

assistant
Alice is correct. Water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10 degrees Celsius, water would be in its solid state, assuming it has already frozen at 0 degrees Celsius or below. Bob's statement that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius is incorrect. However, it's possible for water to exist in a supercooled state below 0 degrees Celsius without freezing, but this is not the typical scenario and does not change the fact that the freezing point of water is at 0 degrees Celsius.
