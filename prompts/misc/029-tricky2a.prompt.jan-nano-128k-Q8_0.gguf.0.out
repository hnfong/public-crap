Okay, let's see. Alice and Bob are talking about water freezing at different temperatures. Alice says water freezes at -10°C, but Bob says it freezes at 0°C. Then Bob says he's still right even though Alice is wrong. Hmm, I need to figure out who is correct here.

First, I remember from basic science that water freezes at 0°C under standard atmospheric pressure. That's the normal freezing point. But wait, maybe there's something about the temperature being -10°C? If the temperature is below 0°C, water should freeze, right? But Alice is saying it freezes at -10°C, which is actually colder than 0°C. So that's confusing.

Wait, maybe Alice is thinking about supercooled water? I think supercooled water can stay liquid below 0°C if it's not disturbed. But that's only possible if the water is pure and not in a container that might cause it to freeze. So if you have supercooled water at -10°C, it could technically freeze, but the normal freezing point is 0°C. So Bob is correct in saying that water freezes at 0°C, but Alice is wrong because she's stating a different temperature. However, Bob is also right in that he's correct about the standard freezing point, but he's saying he's still right even though Alice is wrong. Wait, that seems contradictory. If Alice is wrong, then Bob is right, but he's saying he's still right. So maybe the answer is that Bob is right because the standard freezing point is 0°C, but Alice is incorrect because she's stating a different temperature. However, if the water is supercooled, it can freeze at -10°C, but that's not the usual case. So the correct answer depends on the context. But the question is probably testing the standard knowledge, so Bob is right because the freezing point is 0°C, and Alice is wrong because she's giving a different temperature. But Bob says he's still right, which might be a trick. Wait, maybe the question is a play on words. If the temperature is -10°C, then water would freeze, but the freezing point is 0°C. So Bob is correct in that he's right about the freezing point, but Alice is wrong because she's saying the freezing point is -10°C. So the answer is Bob is right because the standard freezing point is 0°C, and Alice is incorrect. But Bob is also right in that if the temperature is -10°C, water would freeze, but that's not the freezing point. Wait, maybe the confusion is that Bob is correct in stating that water freezes at 0°C, but Alice is wrong because she's saying it freezes at -10°C. So Bob is right, and Alice is wrong. But Bob says he's still right, which is a bit confusing. Maybe he's trying to say that even though Alice is wrong, he's right because the freezing point is 0°C, and if the temperature is -10°C, then water would freeze, but that's not the freezing point. Wait, no. If the temperature is -10°C, then water would freeze, but the freezing point is 0°C. So Bob is correct in stating the freezing point, but Alice is wrong in stating the temperature. Therefore, Bob is right, and Alice is wrong. But the question is phrased as "Who is right? Explain briefly." So the answer is Bob is right because the freezing point of water is 0°C under standard conditions, and Alice is incorrect because she's stating a different temperature. However, if the water is supercooled, it can freeze at -10°C, but that's not the usual case. So the answer should be based on standard conditions, which is 0°C. Therefore, Bob is correct.

Bob is correct. Under standard atmospheric pressure, water freezes at **0°C**, not -10°C. While supercooled water (pure water without nucleation sites) can remain liquid below 0°C, this is an exception and not the typical freezing point. Alice is wrong because she incorrectly states the freezing point as -10°C. Bob's statement aligns with the standard scientific understanding, making him right. [end of text]
