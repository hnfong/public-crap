A) **No**, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. Water freezes at 0°C (32°F) under standard atmospheric pressure. At -12°C, water remains liquid, though it becomes very cold and can form ice when cooled further.

B) **Water will freeze** when cooled to -12°C, but it will not freeze instantly. It will gradually lose heat and eventually reach the freezing point. However, at -12°C, water is still liquid, and freezing requires a drop in temperature to 0°C. The process of freezing is slow at this temperature. [end of text]
