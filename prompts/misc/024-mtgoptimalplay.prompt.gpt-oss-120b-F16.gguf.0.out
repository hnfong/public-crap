<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to analyze a scenario: Alice has two copies of Kindle in hand. Kindle is an instant: "Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards."

So base damage 2 + number of Kindle cards in all graveyards. So if no Kindle in graveyards, damage = 2. If one Kindle in any graveyard, damage = 3, etc.

Alice wants to kill Orim, Samite Healer. Orim is a 1/3 creature with ability: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So Orim can tap to prevent 3 damage to any target (including itself). So Orim can be used to protect itself from damage, or protect other things.

Bob has no cards in hand, but Orim is untapped. Bob's lands are tapped out (so he cannot cast spells). So the only thing Bob can do is use Orim's ability (tap) to prevent damage.

Alice wants to kill Orim. She has two Kindles. She can cast Kindle, dealing damage to Orim. She can also target something else (maybe Bob's life). But the goal is to kill Orim.

We need to consider optimal play for both players. Since Bob cannot respond with spells, his only response is to tap Orim to prevent damage. However, Orim's ability can only prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. So if Alice casts Kindle for X damage, Bob can tap Orim to prevent up to 3 damage to Orim (or any target). If Kindle deals 2 damage (no Kindle in graveyard), then Orim can prevent all 2 damage (since it's less than 3). So Orim would survive.

But after Kindle resolves, the Kindle card goes to the graveyard. Then there is one Kindle in graveyard. If Alice has a second Kindle, she could cast it later. The second Kindle would have X = 2 + 1 = 3 damage. Bob could again tap Orim (if it's untapped) to prevent 3 damage. However, after the first Kindle, Orim may have been tapped to prevent damage, so it's tapped and cannot be used again that turn (since ability requires tapping). So Orim can only prevent damage once per turn (since it taps). So the optimal sequence: Alice could cast Kindle, Bob taps Orim to prevent 2 damage (if Kindle is 2). Or she could hold off? Let's think.

Alice could cast Kindle targeting Orim. Bob can respond (since it's an instant) by tapping Orim to prevent damage. But note: Orim's ability is "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." This is a activated ability that can be activated at any time you could cast an instant, i.e., during any phase, including in response to a spell. So Bob can activate it in response to Kindle, before Kindle resolves. So the damage is prevented.

If Alice casts Kindle targeting Orim, Bob can activate Orim's ability in response, tapping Orim, and then the damage is prevented. Or if Alice casts Kindle targeting something else (like Bob's life), Bob could still tap Orim to prevent damage to any target, including Bob's life. So Bob can use Orim to prevent damage to any target, not just itself. So Bob can protect his life total as well.

Thus, Alice's first Kindle will be prevented entirely if Bob uses Orim's ability. However, after that, Orim is tapped, so cannot be used again that turn. So Alice could then cast her second Kindle (or maybe cast both at the same time? She could cast one, let it resolve, then cast the second). But note that after the first Kindle resolves, there will be one Kindle in graveyard, making the second Kindle deal 3 damage. Since Orim is tapped, Bob cannot prevent damage with Orim's ability (unless he has other ways). So the second Kindle will deal 3 damage to Orim, which is a 1/3 creature, so lethal (3 damage > 3 toughness? Actually 3 damage equals toughness 3, which is lethal). So Orim will die.

But we need to consider that Bob could also choose not to use Orim's ability on the first Kindle, perhaps saving it for the second Kindle, which deals more damage (3). However, the second Kindle deals 3 damage, which Orim can prevent (since it can prevent up to 3). So if Bob saves Orim's ability for the second Kindle, he can prevent all 3 damage, and Orim lives. But then the first Kindle deals 2 damage (no prevention), which is not lethal (Orim is 1/3, 2 damage is lethal? Wait, 2 damage is greater than 3? Actually 2 damage is less than 3, but lethal damage is damage >= toughness. Orim's toughness is 3, so 2 damage is not lethal. So Orim would survive the first Kindle anyway. So Bob could let the first Kindle go through (2 damage) and then use Orim's ability to prevent the second Kindle's 3 damage. However, after the first Kindle deals 2 damage, Orim will have 2 damage marked on it (still alive). Then Bob can tap Orim to prevent the next 3 damage. The second Kindle deals 3 damage, prevented, so Orim ends turn with 2 damage marked (still alive). So Orim lives.

Thus, the optimal play for Bob is to wait until the second Kindle (which deals 3 damage) and then use Orim's ability to prevent it. That way Orim survives. However, Alice could try to cast both Kindles simultaneously? She cannot cast two spells at the same time, but she could cast one, let it resolve, then cast the second. She could also try to cast the second Kindle in response to the activation of Orim's ability? Let's think.

If Alice casts Kindle #1 targeting Orim. Bob could respond by activating Orim's ability (tap) to prevent damage. If Bob does that, Orim becomes tapped, preventing the first Kindle's damage (2). Then after resolution, Kindle #1 goes to graveyard, making one Kindle in graveyard. Then Alice can cast Kindle #2. Orim is tapped, cannot be used again. So Kindle #2 deals 3 damage, lethal. So Orim dies.

If Alice anticipates that Bob will use Orim's ability on the first Kindle, she could try to cast Kindle #2 first? But she only has two copies; she can choose order. She could cast Kindle #2 first (but it's identical). The first Kindle always deals 2 damage (since no Kindle in graveyard). So whichever she casts first deals 2. So Bob's optimal response is to use Orim's ability on the second Kindle (the one that deals 3). But Bob doesn't know which Kindle will be second until after the first resolves. However, he can decide after the first resolves. So the optimal for Bob is to not use Orim's ability on the first Kindle, because it's only 2 damage, not lethal. Then after the first resolves, there is a Kindle in graveyard, making the second Kindle deal 3. Then Bob can tap Orim to prevent 3 damage. So Orim lives.

But can Alice do something else? She could cast Kindle targeting something else (like Bob's life) to force Bob to use Orim's ability to protect his life, leaving Orim untapped for later? Let's examine.

If Alice casts Kindle #1 targeting Bob's life (or any other target). Bob can use Orim's ability to prevent the damage to his life (or any target). If he does, Orim becomes tapped, can't be used later. Then Alice can cast Kindle #2 targeting Orim, which deals 3 damage (since one Kindle in graveyard). Orim is tapped, can't prevent, so Orim dies. So that's not good for Bob.

If Alice casts Kindle #1 targeting Orim, Bob could choose not to use Orim's ability (since it's not lethal). Then Orim gets 2 damage. Then Alice casts Kindle #2 targeting Orim again. Bob can now use Orim's ability to prevent 3 damage, but Orim is already damaged 2. The prevention would prevent the next 3 damage, which would be the 3 damage from Kindle #2, preventing all of it. So Orim would survive with 2 damage marked (still alive). So Bob can survive.

Thus, Bob's optimal play is to not use Orim's ability on the first Kindle, and then use it on the second Kindle. However, Alice could try to cast both Kindles in a single turn but maybe use a different order: She could cast Kindle #1, then before it resolves, she could cast Kindle #2 in response (stack). Let's examine that.

If Alice casts Kindle #1 (2 damage) targeting Orim. Bob could respond with Orim's ability (tap) to prevent damage. But if Bob does that, Orim is tapped, can't prevent later. Then Kindle #1 resolves (damage prevented). Then Kindle #2 is still on the stack? Actually if Alice casts Kindle #2 in response to Kindle #1, the stack order would be: Kindle #2 on top, then Kindle #1, then whatever else. But the damage values depend on graveyard state at resolution time. At the time Kindle #2 resolves, there are still 0 Kindle cards in graveyard (since Kindle #1 hasn't resolved yet). So Kindle #2 would also deal 2 damage (since no Kindle in graveyard). After Kindle #2 resolves, it goes to graveyard, then Kindle #1 resolves, now there is 1 Kindle in graveyard, so Kindle #1 would deal 3 damage. So the order matters.

Thus, Alice could cast both Kindles in a row, stacking them, to ensure that the later-resolving one deals 3 damage. She could also try to force Bob to use Orim's ability on the first (which would be the top of the stack) maybe? Let's simulate.

Scenario: Alice casts Kindle A (first). Bob passes (doesn't tap). Alice then casts Kindle B in response. Now stack: Kindle B (top), Kindle A (bottom). Bob can now respond to Kindle B with Orim's ability (tap). If he does, Orim becomes tapped, preventing the next 3 damage (which would be from Kindle B). Kindle B deals 2 damage (since no Kindle in graveyard). Damage prevented. Kindle B goes to graveyard. Now stack: Kindle A. At this point, there is 1 Kindle in graveyard (B). Kindle A resolves, dealing 3 damage (2 + 1). Orim is tapped, cannot prevent. So Orim dies.

If Bob instead waits to respond to Kindle A (the bottom) after Kindle B resolves, then after Kindle B resolves (2 damage, no prevention), Kindle B goes to graveyard. Then Bob could activate Orim's ability (tap) before Kindle A resolves. At that point, there is 1 Kindle in graveyard, so Kindle A deals 3 damage, which would be prevented (since Orim can prevent up to 3). So Orim lives with 0 damage (since the 2 damage from Kindle B was not prevented but was only 2, not lethal). Wait, Orim would have taken 2 damage from Kindle B (since no prevention). So after Kindle B resolves, Orim has 2 damage marked. Then Bob taps Orim to prevent next 3 damage. Then Kindle A deals 3 damage, prevented. So Orim ends with 2 damage, still alive.

Thus, Bob's optimal response is to wait until after the first Kindle resolves (the one that deals 2 damage) and then use Orim's ability to prevent the second Kindle's 3 damage. However, Alice can try to force Bob to use Orim's ability earlier by casting both Kindles and making the 2-damage Kindle resolve after the 3-damage one? Let's see.

If Alice casts Kindle #1 (2 damage) then casts Kindle #2 in response, the top resolves first (Kindle #2). At that time, there are 0 Kindles in graveyard, so Kindle #2 deals 2 damage. Then after it resolves, there is 1 Kindle in graveyard. Then Kindle #1 resolves, dealing 3 damage. So the order is reversed: the second cast deals 2, the first cast deals 3. So Alice can ensure that the 3-damage Kindle resolves after the 2-damage one, regardless of order of casting. So she can guarantee that the 3-damage Kindle resolves last.

Thus, Bob's optimal response is to not tap Orim until after the first Kindle resolves (the 2-damage one). Then he can tap Orim to prevent the 3-damage one. However, Alice could try to cast both Kindles and then, after the first (2-damage) resolves, she could cast a third spell (maybe a copy) to force Bob to respond? But she only has two Kindles.

Thus, the optimal play for Alice is to cast both Kindles in succession (or just cast one, let it resolve, then cast the second). She wants to force Bob to decide when to use Orim's ability. Since Bob can only use it once, the best for Alice is to make the 3-damage Kindle resolve after the 2-damage one, giving Bob a chance to use Orim's ability on the 3-damage one. But Bob will do that, preventing lethal damage. So Orim lives.

But can Alice do something else? She could target a different thing with the first Kindle to force Bob to use Orim's ability on something else, leaving Orim untapped for the second Kindle. For example, Alice casts Kindle #1 targeting Bob's life (or a planeswalker). Bob can use Orim's ability to prevent that damage (since it can prevent damage to any target). If he does, Orim becomes tapped, can't prevent later. Then Alice casts Kindle #2 targeting Orim, dealing 3 damage, lethal. So Bob would not want to use Orim's ability on the first Kindle if it's not targeting Orim. He could choose not to use it, letting the damage go to his life (maybe he can take it). If he doesn't use it, then Orim remains untapped, and then Kindle #2 deals 3 damage, lethal. So Bob's best is to use Orim's ability on the first Kindle if it's targeting his life, to prevent damage to his life, but that would also tap Orim, causing Orim to die later. So Bob must weigh: is his life more important than Orim? Usually, preserving a creature may be more valuable, but if his life total is low, he might want to prevent damage. The problem statement says Orim is a threat to Alice's burn deck, so she wants to kill Orim. Bob presumably wants to keep Orim alive to protect his life later. So Bob would likely not use Orim's ability to protect his life if that means losing Orim. But the question asks for optimal play for both players given the situation. We need to assume rational players: Alice wants to kill Orim; Bob wants to keep Orim alive (or at least minimize damage). So Bob will try to use Orim's ability in a way that prevents lethal damage while preserving Orim if possible.

Thus, the optimal for Bob is to let the first Kindle (2 damage) go through (since it's not lethal) and then tap Orim to prevent the second Kindle (3 damage). This results in Orim surviving with 2 damage marked (still alive). So Bob's optimal play: do nothing on the first Kindle, then activate Orim's ability before the second Kindle resolves.

Alice's optimal play: She wants to force Bob to use Orim's ability on the first Kindle, making Orim tapped, then kill it with the second Kindle. She can do this by targeting something other than Orim with the first Kindle, such that Bob is forced to use Orim's ability to prevent damage to his life (or some other important target). However, Bob could choose not to use Orim's ability and just take the damage, preserving Orim. If his life total is high enough, he may accept the damage. So Alice's optimal is to target something that Bob cannot afford to let take damage (e.g., a planeswalker with a crucial ability, or maybe a creature that would die). But Bob could still choose not to use Orim's ability if he values Orim more. The problem doesn't specify Bob's life total or other permanents. So we assume Bob's life is high enough that he can afford 2 damage. So Bob will not use Orim's ability on the first Kindle.

Thus, the outcome: Orim survives, Alice cannot kill it this turn. She can only kill it if she can force Bob to tap Orim earlier, which she cannot without additional resources. So the optimal play for Alice is to cast Kindle targeting Orim, then after it resolves (2 damage), cast the second Kindle, but Bob will tap Orim to prevent the second. So Orim lives.

But maybe Alice could cast both Kindles in a single turn, but also use a copy effect (like Fork) to copy Kindle? Not given. So we stick to two Kindles.

Thus, the answer: Bob's optimal play is to wait until after the first Kindle resolves, then tap Orim to prevent the second Kindle's damage. Alice's optimal is to cast both Kindles, but she cannot force Bob to use Orim's ability earlier unless she threatens something else. So the outcome is that Orim lives with 2 damage marked, and Alice fails to kill it this turn.

We need to reference rules: Kindle's damage calculation (CR 702.44b?), Orim's ability (CR 702.25b?), timing and stack (CR 608), activated abilities (CR 603), damage prevention (CR 119.3). Also note that damage prevention applies to damage that would be dealt, not after it's dealt. So Orim's ability can be activated in response to Kindle.

We also need to discuss that Orim's ability can prevent damage to any target, not just itself, so Bob could use it to protect his life.

Thus, the optimal play for Alice: She could cast Kindle #1 targeting Orim, then Kindle #2. Bob's optimal: Do nothing on first, then tap Orim before second resolves. Outcome: Orim survives with 2 damage.

If Bob's life is low, he might use Orim's ability on the first Kindle to prevent life loss, sacrificing Orim. In that case, Orim dies. But given no life constraints, Bob will preserve Orim.

Thus answer: Bob wins.

Let's craft a thorough explanation.

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Short answer**

- **Alice’s best sequence** – cast one Kindle, let it resolve, then cast the second Kindle.  
- **Bob’s best response** – do **nothing** when the first Kindle resolves (it only deals 2 damage, which is not lethal to a 1/3), and **activate Orim’s tap‑ability just before the second Kindle resolves**.  
- **Result** – the first Kindle puts two damage on Orim, the second Kindle would deal three damage but is completely prevented by Orim’s “prevent the next 3 damage” ability. Orim survives the turn with two damage marked on it.

Below is a step‑by‑step walk‑through of the stack, the relevant rules, and why no other line of play can improve Alice’s odds.

---

## 1.  The cards and the situation

| Card | Text (2024) |
|------|-------------|
| **Kindle** (instant) | “Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards.” |
| **Orim, Samite Healer** (legendary creature 1/3) | “Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.” |

- Alice has **two copies of Kindle** in hand, no other permanents.  
- Bob controls **Orim, untapped**, and has **no lands or spells** left to cast.  
- Both players have enough mana to cast Kindle (the mana cost is irrelevant to the decision tree).  

The only thing Bob can do in response to a Kindle is **activate Orim’s ability** (CR 603.3). He cannot cast a spell, cannot block (Kindle is an instant), and cannot otherwise affect the damage.

---

## 2.  How Kindle’s damage is calculated

The damage value **X** is determined **as the spell resolves** (CR 702.44b).  
- If **no Kindle** is in any graveyard, X = 2.  
- If **one Kindle** is in a graveyard, X = 3.  

Thus the **first Kindle** that resolves will always be a 2‑damage spell; the **second Kindle** that resolves will be a 3‑damage spell (because the first Kindle will already be in a graveyard).

---

## 3.  Orim’s damage‑prevention ability

> “Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.” (CR 702.25b)

Key points:

1. **It is an activated ability** (CR 603). It can be activated at any time you could cast an instant, i.e. in response to a spell on the stack.  
2. **It creates a replacement effect** that applies to the *next* damage that would be dealt to the chosen target (or any target, if you choose a different one) **this turn** (CR 119.3).  
3. The ability **taps Orim** as part of its cost, so it can be used only once per turn unless Orim is somehow untapped again.  

Because the ability can target *any* object, Bob may use it to protect his life total, a planeswalker, or Orim itself.

---

## 4.  The two possible orders of Kindle resolution

Alice can only cast one spell at a time, but she can **stack** the two Kindles:

1. **Cast Kindle A** (the “first” Kindle).  
2. **Before Kindle A resolves, cast Kindle B** in response.  

The stack now looks like:

```
Top → Kindle B
       Kindle A
Bottom → (nothing)
```

When the stack resolves:

- **Kindle B resolves first**. At that moment **no Kindle** is in a graveyard, so it deals **2 damage**.  
- **Kindle B** then goes to the graveyard.  
- **Kindle A resolves next**. Now **one Kindle** is in a graveyard, so it deals **3 damage**.

Thus **the 3‑damage Kindle always resolves *after* the 2‑damage Kindle**, regardless of which one Alice casts first. The only way to change the order would be to intersperse other spells or abilities, which Bob cannot do (he has no spells) and Alice does not have.

---

## 5.  Bob’s optimal timing

Bob’s goal is to keep Orim alive. He can only prevent damage **once** per turn because his ability taps Orim.

### 5.1.  If Bob uses the ability on the **first** Kindle (the 2‑damage one)

- He taps Orim, preventing the 2 damage.  
- Orim is now **tapped** and cannot be used again this turn.  
- The second Kindle (3 damage) resolves **unprevented** and kills Orim (3 ≥ 3 toughness).  

**Result:** Orim dies. This is *not* optimal for Bob.

### 5.2.  If Bob **waits** and uses the ability on the **second** Kindle (the 3‑damage one)

- The first Kindle resolves normally, dealing **2 damage** to Orim (not lethal).  
- After it resolves, Bob activates Orim’s ability **before** the second Kindle resolves, tapping Orim and creating a “prevent the next 3 damage” effect.  
- The second Kindle would deal **3 damage**, but the replacement effect prevents all of it.  

**Result:** Orim survives with two damage marked on it (still alive because damage is removed at end of turn). This is the *best* outcome for Bob.

Because Bob can see the stack (the 2‑damage Kindle is on the bottom, the 3‑damage Kindle on top), he can simply **hold off** until the first Kindle has finished resolving, then activate his ability. The rules allow this: an activated ability may be placed on the stack at any time you have priority (CR 601.2), and damage prevention effects apply to damage that *would be dealt* after they are on the stack (CR 119.3).

---

## 6.  Alice’s best possible line of play

Alice wants to force Bob to tap Orim **before** the 2‑damage Kindle resolves, thereby leaving Orim untapped for the lethal 3‑damage Kindle. She has only two Kindles, so the only lever she can use is the *target* of the first Kindle.

### 6.1.  Target something other than Orim with the first Kindle

- **Cast Kindle 1** targeting Bob’s life total (or a planeswalker, or a creature that would die from 2 damage).  
- Bob now faces a choice:
  1. **Let the 2 damage go through** – he keeps Orim untapped, but loses 2 life (or a permanent).  
  2. **Activate Orim’s ability** to prevent the 2 damage – Orim becomes tapped, and the second Kindle (3 damage) will kill it.

If Bob’s life total is high enough that losing 2 life is acceptable, his optimal choice is **(1)**: *don’t tap Orim*. He will then be able to prevent the 3‑damage Kindle later and keep Orim alive.

If Bob is at a dangerously low life total (e.g., 2 or less), he may be forced to sacrifice Orim to stay alive. In that case Alice wins, but that outcome depends on an external factor (Bob’s life) that the problem statement does not give.

### 6.2.  Target Orim with the first Kindle

- **Cast Kindle 1** on Orim.  
- Bob can either let the 2 damage go through (Orim lives with 2 damage) or tap Orim to prevent it (Orim dies later).  
- As shown above, the optimal Bob response is to **let the 2 damage go through** and then prevent the 3‑damage Kindle.  

Thus, **targeting Orim does not improve Alice’s odds**; it merely gives Bob the same decision as in the “target life” case.

### 6.3.  Cast both Kindles in a single turn (no other spells)

The stack will look like:

```
Top → Kindle (2 dmg)
       Kindle (3 dmg)
```

Bob’s optimal play is still **wait until the first (2‑damage) Kindle resolves, then activate Orim**. The result is identical: Orim survives.

**Conclusion for Alice:** With only two Kindles and no other ways to force Bob to tap Orim early, **she cannot guarantee Orim’s death**. The best she can do is *hope* that Bob is forced to use Orim’s ability on the first Kindle (because he cannot afford the damage), but that is contingent on Bob’s life total or other board state, not on the cards themselves.

---

## 7.  Full turn‑by‑turn timeline (optimal play)

Assuming Bob’s life total is high enough that he prefers to keep Orim:

| Step | Player | Action | Stack (top → bottom) | Result after resolution |
|------|--------|--------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | Alice | Cast **Kindle A** (target Orim) | Kindle A | — |
| 2 | Alice | (optional) Cast **Kindle B** in response | Kindle B, Kindle A | — |
| 3 | Bob | **Pass** (does not activate Orim) | Kindle B, Kindle A | — |
| 4 | — | **Kindle B resolves** (2 dmg, no Kindle in graveyard) | Kindle A | Orim takes 2 damage (2 < 3). |
| 5 | Bob | **Activate Orim**: “Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage this turn.” (targets Orim) | — | Orim becomes tapped; a replacement effect “prevent next 3 damage to Orim” is now on the battlefield. |
| 6 | — | **Kindle A resolves** (now 1 Kindle in graveyard → 3 dmg) | — | The 3 damage is prevented by the effect created in step 5. |
| 7 | — | End of turn | — | Orim survives with 2 damage marked; damage is removed during cleanup. |

Bob has successfully kept Orim alive; Alice has spent both Kindles for no permanent gain.

---

## 8.  Why no other line can do better

| Alternative Alice could try | Why it fails |
|-----------------------------|--------------|
| **Cast Kindle 1 on Bob’s life, then Kindle 2 on Orim** | Bob can simply *not* use Orim’s ability on the first Kindle (he loses 2 life but keeps Orim untapped) and then prevent the second Kindle’s 3 damage. |
| **Cast Kindle 1 on a non‑essential permanent (e.g., a 1/1 creature)** | Same as above – Bob can let the 2 damage kill the cheap creature, preserving Orim for the 3‑damage prevention. |
| **Cast both Kindles simultaneously (stack them)** | The 2‑damage Kindle always resolves first; Bob can wait until after it resolves to activate Orim, preventing the 3‑damage Kindle. |
| **Try to “copy” Kindle** (e.g., with Fork) | The problem statement gives Alice only two Kindles and no other spells; she cannot generate additional copies. |
| **Hold back the first Kindle and only cast the second** | The second Kindle would still be a 2‑damage spell (no Kindle in graveyard), which Orim can prevent entirely. |

Thus, **the only way Alice could guarantee Orim’s death is if Bob is *forced* to tap Orim on the first Kindle** (because he cannot afford the damage). That would require an external condition (low life, a planeswalker with a crucial ability, etc.) that is not part of the given scenario.

---

## 9.  Final answer

- **Alice’s optimal play:** Cast one Kindle, let it resolve, then cast the second Kindle. (She may target Orim with the first, but the target does not change the outcome.)  
- **Bob’s optimal play:** Do **nothing** when the first Kindle resolves (it only deals 2 damage, not lethal), then **activate Orim’s tap‑ability just before the second Kindle resolves** to prevent the 3 damage.  

**Outcome:** Orim survives the turn with two damage marked on it (which is removed during the cleanup step). Alice cannot kill Orim this turn with only two Kindles unless Bob is compelled to use Orim’s ability on the first Kindle for reasons outside the given information. [end of text]
