<think>Okay, the user is asking about water freezing at -12°C and what happens to a glass of pure water cooled to that temperature. Let me start by recalling the basics. Pure water freezes at 0°C under standard pressure. So at -12°C, it should be frozen, right? But the user mentions a glass of pure water cooled to -12°C. That seems contradictory because if it's pure, it should freeze at 0°C. Maybe there's something about supercooling here.

Supercooling happens when water is cooled below 0°C without freezing. It requires very still conditions, no impurities, no disturbances. So if the user has a glass of pure water and cools it slowly to -12°C, it might stay liquid. But then any disturbance, like shaking or adding an impurity, would cause instant freezing. That explains part B. For part A, the answer is yes, water freezes at -12°C, but only if it's pure and has nucleation sites. Without those, it can remain liquid below 0°C.

Wait, the user might be confused because they heard water freezes at 0°C but now it's at -12°C and still liquid. So I need to clarify that freezing point is 0°C under normal conditions, but supercooling allows it to go lower. Also, pressure affects freezing point, but standard pressure is assumed here. Impurities raise the freezing point, but pure water can supercool. 

For part B, cooling pure water to -12°C without disturbances results in supercooled water. Then any disturbance triggers freezing. The user might be testing this in a lab or just curious. They might want to know why it doesn't freeze immediately. So explaining nucleation is key. Maybe they encountered supercooled water and are surprised it didn't freeze. Or they want to experiment safely, knowing adding an impurity causes sudden freezing. 

Also, consider safety. Supercooled water can be dangerous if it freezes suddenly, like in a glass that shatters. The user might be a student or hobbyist experimenting. They need to know handling supercooled water requires caution. Emphasize that part B's scenario is possible but unstable. 

Check if there's any other factor. Salt or solutes? But the user says pure water, so no. Pressure? Standard assumed. Container? Glass is fine, but smooth surfaces might help supercooling. Disturbance is the trigger. 

So answers: A) Yes, but supercooling can prevent freezing below 0°C. B) It can supercool to -12°C and remain liquid until disturbed, then freezes instantly. Need to explain nucleation and supercooling clearly. Keep it brief but thorough. User's deeper need: understanding why water doesn't freeze at -12°C in their glass, possibly for a science experiment or curiosity about natural phenomena like freezing rain.</think>Here's a concise explanation for each question:

**A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?**
*   **Yes, but...** The freezing point of *pure water* under standard pressure is **0°C**. At -12°C, water is thermodynamically stable as a solid (ice). **However**, water can sometimes remain liquid below 0°C if it lacks nucleation sites (impurities, disturbances, container imperfections). This is called **supercooling**. So, while -12°C is well below the normal freezing point, freezing isn't *guaranteed* without a trigger.

**B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?**
*   **It can supercool and remain liquid...** If the water is very pure, the container is smooth, and cooling is slow/quiet (minimizing disturbances), the water might **supercool** down to -12°C without freezing. It becomes a metastable liquid below its normal freezing point.
*   **...but it will freeze instantly if disturbed.** Any disturbance (adding an impurity, shaking the glass, scratching the container, introducing a seed crystal) provides the necessary nucleation site. This triggers **rapid, spontaneous freezing** throughout the supercooled water, turning it solid almost instantly.

**In summary:**
*   **A)** Water *should* freeze at -12°C, but supercooling can prevent it.
*   **B)** Pure water cooled to -12°C can supercool (stay liquid), but any disturbance causes instant freezing. [end of text]
