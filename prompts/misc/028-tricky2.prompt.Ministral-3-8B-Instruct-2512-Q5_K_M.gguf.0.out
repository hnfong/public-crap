Alice is correct in stating that **pure water freezes at 0°C (32°F) under standard conditions (at 1 atm pressure)**.

Bob is technically correct in a broader sense because **water can freeze at temperatures below 0°C** under certain conditions, such as:
- **Supercooling**: Pure water can remain liquid below 0°C if it is cooled slowly and lacks nucleation sites (e.g., dust, ice crystals). It will freeze abruptly when disturbed.
- **Impurities or pressure**: Dissolved salts, solutes, or increased pressure can lower the freezing point (e.g., seawater freezes at ~-2°C).

However, **under normal circumstances (pure water at 1 atm)**, Alice’s statement is accurate. Bob’s claim is only correct in specific cases. [end of text]
