Let's analyze this Magic: the Gathering scenario step by step, focusing on **game mechanics**, **player objectives**, and **optimal plays** for both Alice and Bob.

---

## **Setup Recap:**

- **Alice's hand**: 2x [Kindle] (instant: "Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards.")
- **Alice's mana**: Sufficient to cast any spells.
- **Bob's hand**: Empty.
- **Bob's board**: 1x [Orim, Samite Healer] (1/3, untapped, legendary) with ability: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."
- **It is Alice's turn**.
- **Bob's lands are tapped out**.

---

## **Objective:**

- **Alice** wants to **kill Orim**.
- **Bob** wants to **survive** (i.e., prevent Orim from dying, or at least delay it).

---

## **Key Mechanics to Consider:**

1. **Kindle's damage formula**:  
   X = 2 + number of Kindles in all graveyards.  
   So, if no Kindles are in the graveyard, X = 2.  
   If 1 Kindle is in the graveyard, X = 3.  
   If 2 Kindles are in the graveyard, X = 4.

2. **Orim's ability**:  
   "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."  
   This is a **prevention shield** that can be used **once per turn** (since it's a tap ability).  
   It prevents **3 damage** to **any target** (creature, player, planeswalker) **this turn**.

3. **Graveyard interaction**:  
   Casting a Kindle puts it into the graveyard, which increases the damage of future Kindles.

4. **Instant timing**:  
   Kindles can be cast at **any time** (including during Bob's turn, but here it's Alice's turn).

---

## **Alice's Thought Process:**

Alice wants to kill Orim. She has 2 Kindles. She needs to **deal enough damage** to overcome Orim's 3 toughness and any damage prevention.

### Step 1: First Kindle

- Cast the first Kindle targeting Orim.
- X = 2 (no Kindles in graveyard) → Deals 2 damage.
- Orim is now at 1/3 (1 toughness left).

But wait—**Orim's ability** is still untapped. Bob can tap Orim to prevent 3 damage. So if Alice casts the first Kindle, Bob can respond by tapping Orim to prevent the 2 damage.

But wait—**no**. The **order of operations** is important here.

### Step 2: Use Orim's ability to prevent damage

If Alice casts the first Kindle, Bob can **respond** to the spell by tapping Orim to activate its ability. That ability will go on the stack **on top of** the Kindle spell.

So the sequence would be:

1. Alice casts Kindle targeting Orim.
2. Bob activates Orim's ability (tap to prevent 3 damage).
3. The ability resolves first: prevents 3 damage.
4. Then the Kindle resolves: deals 2 damage, but **it's prevented**.

So the first Kindle does **nothing** to Orim.

### Step 3: Second Kindle

If Alice casts the second Kindle, again targeting Orim, Bob can respond again with Orim's ability.

Same result: 2 damage, prevented.

So two Kindles with no graveyard Kindles = 2x2 = 4 damage, all prevented.

### Step 4: Use graveyard to increase damage

But wait—**if Alice casts the first Kindle, it goes to the graveyard**. That means the second Kindle will deal **3 damage**.

So let's revise the plan:

1. Alice casts the **first Kindle** targeting Orim.
   - X = 2 → 2 damage.
   - Bob responds with Orim's ability to prevent 3 damage.
   - The 2 damage is prevented.
   - First Kindle goes to graveyard.

2. Now, Alice casts the **second Kindle** targeting Orim.
   - X = 2 + 1 = 3 → 3 damage.
   - Bob responds with Orim's ability again? Wait—**no**. Orim is **already tapped** from the first ability.

   Wait—**Orim's ability** is a **tap ability**. To activate it, you have to **tap Orim**. But Orim is already tapped from the first activation.

   So Bob **cannot** activate Orim's ability again **this turn**.

   So the second Kindle will deal **3 damage** to Orim.

   Orim is at 1/3 → 3 damage → Dies.

Perfect.

## **Bob's Thought Process:**

Bob knows Alice wants to kill Orim. He has no cards in hand, so he can't counter the Kindles or use other damage prevention.

But he **can** use Orim's ability **once per turn**.

So his optimal play is to **use Orim's ability to prevent the first Kindle's damage**.

That way, he **saves Orim** for the second Kindle.

But wait—**he can't**. Because if he uses Orim's ability to prevent the first 2 damage, then Orim is tapped, and he can't use it again.

But if he **doesn't** use the ability, then the first Kindle will deal 2 damage to Orim, and Orim will be at 1/3.

Then the second Kindle will deal 3 damage, and Orim will die.

So Bob's **only option** is to **use Orim's ability to prevent the first 2 damage**.

But that's still a **loss**—he can't prevent the second 3 damage.

So Bob's **optimal play** is to **tap Orim to prevent the first 2 damage**.

## **Optimal Play Sequence:**

1. **Alice casts the first Kindle** targeting Orim.
   - Stack: [Kindle spell].

2. **Bob responds** by activating Orim's ability: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage."
   - Stack: [Orim's ability] on top of [Kindle spell].

3. **Orim's ability resolves**: Prevents 3 damage to Orim.
   - Orim is now tapped.

4. **Kindle spell resolves**: Deals 2 damage to Orim, but it's prevented.
   - First Kindle goes to graveyard.

5. **Alice casts the second Kindle** targeting Orim.
   - X = 2 + 1 = 3 → 3 damage.
   - Stack: [Kindle spell].

6. **Bob has no response** (no cards, Orim is tapped, no other prevention).
   - Kindle resolves: Deals 3 damage to Orim.

7. **Orim is at 1/3 → 3 damage → Dies**.

---

## **Outcome:**

- **Orim is destroyed**.
- **Alice wins the exchange**.
- **Bob has no way to prevent the second Kindle's damage**.

---

## **Why This Is Optimal:**

- **For Alice**: She uses the **graveyard feedback loop** of Kindle to increase its damage. The first Kindle puts a copy in the graveyard, making the second one more powerful. She also uses **instant timing** to cast both Kindles on her turn, maximizing efficiency.

- **For Bob**: He uses his **only available resource** (Orim's ability) to **delay** the kill, but it's not enough to prevent it. He has no other cards to respond, so he has to accept the loss.

---

## **Key Takeaways:**

- **Graveyard synergies** are powerful in burn decks.
- **Prevention abilities** are one-time per turn (if tap-based) and can be **outlasted** by increasing damage.
- **Instant spells** allow for **stack manipulation** and **feedback loops**.
- **Board control** is critical—Bob's lack of interaction makes him vulnerable to burn.

---

## **Final Answer:**

The **optimal play** for Alice is to **cast the first Kindle targeting Orim**, allowing Bob
