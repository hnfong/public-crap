A) **Yes**, water *can* freeze at −12 °C — but only if it has nucleation sites (e.g., impurities, container imperfections) to initiate ice formation. Pure water, however, may remain liquid below 0 °C due to supercooling.

B) If the glass contains **pure water** and is cooled carefully without disturbance, it may **supercool** and remain liquid even at −12 °C. However, any disturbance (e.g., shaking, adding a seed crystal) can trigger rapid freezing. If the water contains impurities or the glass has surface irregularities, it will likely freeze at or near 0 °C and be fully frozen by −12 °C. [end of text]
