Yo, let me break it down like a verse, no fluff, no jive—just the truth:

The Fed, man, it’s the bank that runs the show,  
Not the Treasury, no, it’s the Fed that’s the flow.  
They control the money, the cash, the coins, the bills,  
They set the rules, they make the rules, they don’t let you spill.

They don’t just print bills, they print the whole game,  
They raise the interest, they lower the name.  
If you want to borrow, they say, “Hey, you can,”  
But if you’re late on payments, they’ll make you pay more than you can.

They watch the economy, like a boss in the zone,  
They check the stock market, the jobs, the zone.  
If the economy’s slow, they give you a break,  
If it’s hot, they raise the rate, and you’ll feel the back.

They don’t take orders from the president or the Congress,  
They’re the ones in charge, they’re the ones that make the moves.  
They’re like the king of the money game,  
They control the flow, they control the fame.

So next time you hear about the Fed, don’t be confused,  
It’s the one that’s in charge, the one that’s in the house.  
They don’t just print money, they print the whole deal,  
They’re the king of the money game, and they’re not to be dealt with. [end of text]
