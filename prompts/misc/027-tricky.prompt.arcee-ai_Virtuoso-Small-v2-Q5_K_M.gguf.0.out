A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of pure water is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). At -12 degrees Celsius, water remains in its liquid state.

B) If you cool pure water down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will remain in a liquid state. However, it will be very close to its freezing point, and if any impurities or disturbances are present, it may start to form ice crystals. In a perfectly pure and still environment, it would remain liquid until it reaches 0 degrees Celsius. [end of text]
