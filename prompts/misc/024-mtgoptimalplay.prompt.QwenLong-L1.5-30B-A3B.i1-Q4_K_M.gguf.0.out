Okay, let's try to figure out this Magic: The Gathering problem. So, Alice has two copies of Kindle in her hand, and Bob has Orim, Samite Healer in play. Alice wants to kill Orim, and it's her turn. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to recall what Kindle does. The problem says Kindle is an instant: "Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards." Wait, so the damage is 2 plus the number of Kindle cards in all graveyards. But right now, Alice has two Kindles in her hand, so there are zero Kindles in the graveyard yet. So if she casts one Kindle, the damage would be 2 + 0 = 2. But if she casts both, maybe the second one would have the first one in the graveyard?

Wait, but when you cast a spell, it goes to the graveyard after resolving. So if Alice casts the first Kindle, it resolves, deals 2 damage to Orim, then goes to the graveyard. Then, if she casts the second Kindle, the number of Kindles in all graveyards would be 1 (the first one), so the damage would be 2 + 1 = 3. So the second Kindle would deal 3 damage.

But Orim has 1 toughness, so to kill it, Alice needs to deal at least 1 damage. Wait, but Orim is a 1/3 creature, so it has 3 toughness. So she needs to deal 3 damage to kill it. Wait, no: Orim's toughness is 3, so to destroy it, you need to deal 3 or more damage. So if she deals 3 damage, Orim dies.

But Orim has an ability: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So if Bob taps Orim, he can prevent the next 3 damage to any target this turn. So if Alice tries to deal damage, Bob can use Orim's ability to prevent it.

Wait, but the ability says "Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So if Bob taps Orim, then any damage that would be dealt to any target this turn is prevented up to 3. So if Alice casts a spell that deals damage, Bob can prevent up to 3 damage.

But Alice has two Kindles. Let's think about the sequence.

First, it's Alice's turn. She has two Kindles in hand. She wants to kill Orim. Orim is a 1/3 creature, so needs 3 damage. But Orim's ability can prevent 3 damage. So if Alice tries to deal 3 damage, Bob can prevent it. But maybe she can deal more than 3, but wait, the problem says "the next 3 damage," so if she deals 4 damage, the first 3 would be prevented, and the 4th would still go through. But wait, the ability says "prevent the next 3 damage," so it's a single instance of preventing up to 3 damage. Wait, no, the ability is "Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So it's a one-time prevention of up to 3 damage. So if Alice deals 3 damage, it's all prevented. If she deals 4, then 3 is prevented, 1 gets through.

But Orim has 3 toughness, so to kill it, Alice needs to deal 3 damage. If Bob prevents 3 damage, then Orim takes 0 damage, so it stays alive. So Alice needs to deal more than 3 damage to get past the prevention.

Wait, but let's check the exact wording. "Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So "the next 3 damage" meaning the first 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. So if Alice casts a spell that deals 3 damage, that's all prevented. If she casts a spell that deals 4 damage, then 3 is prevented, 1 is dealt. So Orim would take 1 damage, which isn't enough to kill it (needs 3). Wait, but Orim has 3 toughness, so 1 damage would reduce it to 2 toughness, but not kill it. So Alice would need to deal 3 damage to kill it, but if Bob prevents 3, then it's 0. So she needs to deal 4 damage to get 1 through, but that's not enough. Wait, no: 3 damage is needed to kill it. If Bob prevents 3, then 0 damage is dealt, so Orim is still at 3 toughness. If Alice deals 4, then 3 is prevented, 1 is dealt, so Orim is at 2 toughness. Still alive. So she needs to deal 3 damage, but Bob can prevent it. So how can she kill Orim?

Wait, maybe she can cast both Kindles. Let's see. Let's think about the order.

First, if Alice casts the first Kindle. The damage is 2 + 0 (since no Kindles in graveyard yet) = 2. So it deals 2 damage to Orim. Then, the first Kindle goes to the graveyard. Now, when she casts the second Kindle, the number of Kindles in all graveyards is 1, so the damage is 2 + 1 = 3. So the second Kindle would deal 3 damage. So total damage would be 2 + 3 = 5. But Bob can use Orim's ability to prevent the next 3 damage. So if Bob taps Orim before the damage is dealt, he can prevent up to 3 damage.

Wait, but when does Bob get to activate Orim's ability? The ability is a tap ability, so Bob can activate it during his turn, but it's Alice's turn. Wait, the problem says it's Alice's turn. So Bob can't activate abilities during Alice's turn unless it's a mana ability or something, but Orim's ability is a tap ability, which is a regular ability, so Bob can only activate it during his own turn, right? Wait, no. In Magic, players can activate abilities during their own turn, but also during other players' turns if it's a mana ability or if it's an ability that can be activated at any time. Wait, Orim's ability is "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So the ability is a tap ability, which means you have to tap the creature to activate it. But you can only activate it during your own turn, right? Wait, no. Actually, in Magic, you can activate abilities during any player's turn, as long as it's a legal time to do so. But for a tap ability, you have to tap the permanent, and you can do that during your own turn or during another player's turn, but only if it's a time when you can activate abilities. Wait, but the ability says "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage..." So the activation is a tap, which is a cost, so you have to tap Orim to activate it. But since it's Alice's turn, Bob can't activate Orim's ability during Alice's turn unless it's a mana ability. Wait, Orim's ability isn't a mana ability, so Bob can't activate it during Alice's turn. Wait, but the problem says "Bob has no cards in hand, but has a Orim, Samite Healer in play, untapped." So Orim is untapped. So Bob could tap it during his own turn, but it's Alice's turn. So during Alice's turn, Bob can't activate Orim's ability because it's not his turn. Wait, but the ability says "Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So "this turn" refers to the current turn, which is Alice's turn. So if Bob activates Orim's ability during Alice's turn, would that work? Wait, but Bob can't activate abilities during Alice's turn unless it's a mana ability. Wait, no, actually, players can activate abilities during other players' turns, but only if it's a time when they can do so. For example, you can activate an ability during the declare attackers step, but generally, abilities that require tapping can be activated during the active player's turn, but Bob isn't the active player here. Wait, the active player is Alice, so Bob can't activate abilities during Alice's turn unless it's a mana ability. Orim's ability isn't a mana ability, so Bob can't activate it during Alice's turn. Therefore, Bob can't prevent the damage from Alice's spells because he can't activate Orim's ability until his own turn.

Wait, but the problem says "Bob's lands are tapped out," so he can't generate mana, but that's probably irrelevant here. The key point is whether Bob can activate Orim's ability during Alice's turn. Let me confirm the rules. According to MTG rules, players can activate abilities during their own turn, but during another player's turn, they can only activate abilities that are mana abilities or abilities that can be activated at any time (like some triggered abilities, but Orim's is a regular ability). So Orim's ability is a tap ability, which is a regular ability, so Bob can't activate it during Alice's turn. Therefore, Bob can't prevent the damage from Alice's Kindles because he can't activate Orim's ability until his own turn.

Wait, but the ability says "Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So "this turn" is Alice's turn. So if Bob could activate the ability during Alice's turn, he could prevent the damage. But since he can't activate it during Alice's turn, the damage would go through. So Alice can just cast both Kindles, deal 2 + 3 = 5 damage to Orim, which is more than enough to kill it (since Orim has 3 toughness). Wait, but Orim is 1/3, so 3 damage would kill it. So 5 damage is more than enough. So why would Bob need to do anything? Wait, but maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let's check the exact wording of Kindle. "Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards." So when you cast the first Kindle, there are zero Kindles in the graveyard, so X=2. So it deals 2 damage. Then, the first Kindle goes to the graveyard. Then, when you cast the second Kindle, the number of Kindles in all graveyards is 1, so X=3. So the second Kindle deals 3 damage. Total damage: 2 + 3 = 5. Orim has 3 toughness, so 5 damage would kill it, leaving 2 damage to spare. So Alice can just cast both Kindles, and Orim dies.

But wait, the problem says "Bob has a Orim, Samite Healer in play, untapped." So Orim is untapped. But since Bob can't activate Orim's ability during Alice's turn, he can't prevent the damage. So Alice just casts both Kindles, and Orim dies. But the question is asking for the optimal play for both players. So maybe Bob can do something? Wait, but Bob can't activate Orim's ability during Alice's turn. So he can't prevent the damage. So Alice's optimal play is to cast both Kindles, and Orim dies.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let's think about the timing. When Alice casts the first Kindle, it's an instant, so she can cast it during her main phase. Then, it resolves, dealing 2 damage to Orim. Then, she casts the second Kindle, which resolves, dealing 3 damage to Orim. Total damage 5, which is more than 3, so Orim dies. Bob can't do anything because he can't activate Orim's ability during Alice's turn. So that's the optimal play for Alice: cast both Kindles.

But wait, is there a way for Bob to prevent this? Let's see. Maybe Bob can do something else. But Bob has no cards in hand, and his lands are tapped out. So he can't cast any spells. The only thing he has is Orim, which is a creature. But since it's Alice's turn, Bob can't do anything with Orim except maybe tap it, but he can't activate its ability. Wait, but Orim's ability is a tap ability, so to activate it, you have to tap Orim. But Bob can't activate it during Alice's turn. So he can't prevent the damage.

Wait, but maybe the problem is that the ability says "Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So if Alice casts a spell that deals damage, and Bob activates Orim's ability before that damage is dealt, then the damage is prevented. But since it's Alice's turn, Bob can't activate Orim's ability. So the damage would be dealt normally.

Wait, but let's check the exact timing. When Alice casts the first Kindle, it's a spell, so it goes on the stack. Then, when it resolves, it deals 2 damage. Then, the second Kindle is cast, goes on the stack, resolves, deals 3 damage. So the damage is dealt in two separate instances. So Bob would need to prevent each instance of damage. But the ability says "prevent the next 3 damage," so it's a single prevention of up to 3 damage. So if the first Kindle deals 2 damage, that's part of the next 3 damage. Then the second Kindle deals 3 damage, which would be the next 3. Wait, but the ability says "the next 3 damage," so the first 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. So if Alice deals 2 damage, then 3 damage, that's 5 total. The ability would prevent the first 3 damage. So the 2 damage from the first Kindle is prevented, and the first 1 damage from the second Kindle is prevented, leaving 2 damage from the second Kindle. Wait, but Orim has 3 toughness, so 2 damage would leave it at 1 toughness, not dead. Wait, but that's if the prevention is applied to the total damage.

Wait, let's clarify. The ability says "prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So "the next 3 damage" meaning the first 3 damage that would be dealt to any target during this turn. So if Alice deals 2 damage (from the first Kindle), that's the first 2 damage. Then, the second Kindle deals 3 damage, so the next 3 damage. So the ability would prevent the first 3 damage. So the 2 damage from the first Kindle is prevented, and 1 damage from the second Kindle is prevented, so the second Kindle deals 2 damage (3 - 1 = 2). So total damage dealt is 2. Orim has 3 toughness, so 2 damage would leave it at 1 toughness, not dead. Wait, but that's if the prevention is applied to the total damage.

Wait, but how does prevention work? When damage is dealt, it's prevented before it's applied. So if the ability is active, and damage is about to be dealt, the prevention is applied. So let's say Bob could activate Orim's ability. Let's assume for a second that Bob can activate it during Alice's turn. Then, he taps Orim, activating the ability, which prevents the next 3 damage. Then, when Alice casts the first Kindle, it deals 2 damage. The prevention would prevent that 2 damage, so 0 damage is dealt. Then, when she casts the second Kindle, it deals 3 damage. The prevention would prevent the next 3 damage, so the 3 damage is prevented, so 0 damage is dealt. So Orim takes 0 damage, stays alive. But if Bob can't activate the ability, then the damage is dealt normally.

But the key question is: can Bob activate Orim's ability during Alice's turn? According to MTG rules, players can only activate abilities during their own turn, unless it's a mana ability. Orim's ability is a tap ability, which is a regular ability, so Bob can't activate it during Alice's turn. Therefore, Bob can't prevent the damage. So Alice can just cast both Kindles, deal 5 damage, and kill Orim.

Wait, but let's confirm the rules. The Comprehensive Rules state that a player may activate an ability of a permanent they control during their own turn, but during another player's turn, they can only activate mana abilities. Orim's ability is not a mana ability, so Bob can't activate it during Alice's turn. Therefore, the ability isn't active when Alice casts her spells. So the damage from both Kindles is dealt normally.

Wait, but the ability says "Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So "this turn" is Alice's turn. So if Bob could activate the ability, it would prevent the next 3 damage during Alice's turn. But since he can't activate it, the ability isn't active, so no prevention happens. Therefore, Alice can just cast both Kindles, and Orim dies.

But wait, the problem says "Bob has a Orim, Samite Healer in play, untapped." So Orim is untapped, but Bob can't tap it during Alice's turn because he can't activate the ability. So Orim remains untapped, but Bob can't do anything with it. So Alice's optimal play is to cast both Kindles.

Wait, but let's check if there's a different way. Maybe Alice should cast one Kindle first, then the other. But as we saw, the first deals 2, the second deals 3, total 5. So that's 5 damage, which is more than enough. So Orim dies.

But wait, the problem says "Alice has (only) two cards in her hand, specifically two copies of 'Kindle'." So she has no other cards. So she can't do anything else. So her only options are to cast one Kindle, cast both Kindles, or do nothing. But she wants to kill Orim, so she should cast both.

Wait, but let's make sure about the number of Kindles in the graveyard. When she casts the first Kindle, it's in the graveyard when she casts the second one. So the second Kindle's damage is 2 + 1 = 3. Correct.

Is there a possibility that the first Kindle's damage is 2, but then Orim is still alive, and Bob can do something? But Bob can't do anything because he has no cards and his lands are tapped out. So he can't cast anything, and he can't activate Orim's ability. So even if Alice only casts one Kindle, dealing 2 damage, Orim would have 1 toughness left (since it's 3 toughness, 2 damage reduces it to 1). But then Alice can cast the second Kindle, dealing 3 damage, which would kill it. So she needs to cast both.

Wait, but if she casts one Kindle, deals 2 damage, Orim is at 1 toughness. Then, if Bob could activate Orim's ability, he could prevent the next 3 damage, but since he can't, the second Kindle would deal 3 damage, killing Orim. So either way, casting both is the way to go.

Wait, but let's consider if Bob could do something else. For example, if Bob could sacrifice Orim or something, but he has no cards in hand, so he can't cast spells. He can't sacrifice Orim because it's a creature, and sacrificing it would require a spell or ability, which he doesn't have. So Bob is stuck.

Wait, but the problem says "Bob has no cards in hand, but has a Orim, Samite Healer in play, untapped." So he has Orim, but no other cards. So he can't do anything. So Alice's optimal play is to cast both Kindles, and Orim dies.

Wait, but let me check if the damage from the two Kindles is considered as separate instances. So the first Kindle deals 2 damage, which is a separate instance from the second Kindle's 3 damage. So the prevention would apply to the first 3 damage. So if the first Kindle deals 2, that's part of the 3, and the second Kindle deals 3, so the first 1 of that 3 is prevented, leaving 2 damage. So total damage would be 2 (from first Kindle) + 2 (from second Kindle) = 4? Wait, no. Wait, the prevention is for the next 3 damage. So the first 3 damage that would be dealt is prevented. So if the first Kindle deals 2, that's 2 of the 3, then the second Kindle deals 3, so the next 1 damage from the second Kindle is prevented, so the second Kindle deals 2. So total damage is 2 + 2 = 4. Wait, but Orim has 3 toughness, so 4 damage would kill it. Wait, but 3 toughness means 3 damage is needed to kill it. So 4 damage would be more than enough. So even if the prevention is applied, Orim would still die. Wait, but this is only if Bob can activate the ability. But if Bob can't activate the ability, then the prevention doesn't happen, so the total damage is 5, which is more than enough.

Wait, but the key point is whether Bob can activate the ability. If he can't, then the damage is 5, Orim dies. If he can, then the damage is 4 (2 + 2), which still kills Orim. Wait, but 4 damage to a 3 toughness creature would kill it. So even if Bob prevents 3 damage, the remaining 2 damage from the second Kindle would still kill Orim. Wait, let's recalculate.

If Bob activates Orim's ability (which he can't, but let's assume he could), then the next 3 damage is prevented. So the first Kindle deals 2 damage, which is prevented. Then the second Kindle deals 3 damage, but the next 3 damage is prevented, so all 3 is prevented. Wait, no. The ability says "prevent the next 3 damage," so the first 3 damage that would be dealt. So the first Kindle's 2 damage is the first 2, then the second Kindle's 3 damage is the next 3. So the prevention would prevent the first 3 damage, which would be the 2 from the first Kindle and 1 from the second Kindle. So the second Kindle would deal 2 damage (3 - 1 = 2). So total damage is 2. Wait, no: the first Kindle's damage is prevented (2), and the second Kindle's damage is reduced by 1 (so 2), so total damage is 2. Wait, but that's if the prevention is applied to the total damage. Wait, no. Let's think of it as the damage is dealt in order. First, the first Kindle resolves, dealing 2 damage. The prevention would prevent that 2 damage, so 0 damage. Then, the second Kindle resolves, dealing 3 damage. The prevention would prevent the next 3 damage, so the 3 damage is prevented, so 0 damage. So total damage 0. But that's only if the prevention is active before the damage is dealt.

But the problem is whether Bob can activate the ability before the damage is dealt. If Bob can activate Orim's ability during Alice's turn, then he can prevent the damage. But as per the rules, he can't. So the damage is dealt normally.

Wait, but let's confirm the timing. When Alice casts a spell, it goes on the stack. Then, when it resolves, damage is dealt. So if Bob could activate Orim's ability before the first Kindle resolves, he could prevent the damage. But since it's Alice's turn, Bob can't activate Orim's ability. So the first Kindle resolves, deals 2 damage. Then, the second Kindle resolves, deals 3 damage. Total 5, Orim dies.

Wait, but the problem states "Bob's lands are tapped out," so he can't generate mana, but that's irrelevant here because he's not casting spells. The only thing he has is Orim, which he can't use to prevent damage because he can't activate its ability.

Wait, but let's check if Orim's ability is a mana ability. The ability is "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." Mana abilities are abilities that produce mana, like "Tap: Add {W}." Orim's ability doesn't produce mana, so it's not a mana ability. Therefore, Bob can't activate it during Alice's turn. So the ability isn't active, so no damage is prevented.

Therefore, Alice's optimal play is to cast both Kindles, dealing 5 damage to Orim, killing it.

Wait, but the problem says "the optimal play for both players." So Bob's optimal play would be... but Bob can't do anything. Since he can't activate Orim's ability, he has no actions. So his optimal play is to do nothing, which is the only thing he can do.

Wait, but let me make sure there's no other way. For example, could Bob use Orim's ability to prevent damage from a different source? But there's no other damage being dealt. Alice is the one casting the spells. So no, Bob can't prevent anything.

Wait, another angle: when Alice casts the first Kindle, it's an instant, so she can cast it during her main phase. Then, after it resolves, she casts the second Kindle. So the sequence is:

1. Alice casts first Kindle (2 damage to Orim).
2. First Kindle resolves, deals 2 damage. Orim now has 1 toughness left (3 - 2 = 1).
3. Alice casts second Kindle (3 damage to Orim).
4. Second Kindle resolves, deals 3 damage. Orim takes 3 damage, but it only had 1 toughness left, so it dies (3 - 1 = 0).

Wait, but Orim's toughness is 3, so after 2 damage, it's at 1 toughness. Then, 3 more damage would reduce it to 0, so it dies. So total damage is 5, but the actual damage that kills it is the 3 from the second Kindle, which is more than the remaining 1 toughness.

Wait, but the problem is whether Bob can prevent the damage. Since he can't, the damage is applied. So Orim dies.

Is there a possibility that the first Kindle's damage is 2, but then Bob can do something? But Bob has no cards, so he can't cast anything. He can't tap Orim to activate the ability because he can't activate it during Alice's turn. So no.

Wait, but let's check the exact wording of Orim's ability: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So "this turn" refers to the turn when the ability is activated. If Bob could activate it during his own turn, but it's Alice's turn, so "this turn" would be Alice's turn. But since he can't activate it, the ability isn't active, so no prevention.

Therefore, the optimal play for Alice is to cast both Kindles, and Orim dies. Bob has no optimal play because he can't do anything.

Wait, but the problem says "optimal play for both players." So maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, another thought: when Alice casts the first Kindle, it's in the graveyard, so when she casts the second Kindle, the number of Kindles in the graveyard is 1, so X=3. So the second Kindle deals 3. But what if Alice casts the second Kindle first? Wait, but she has two Kindles in hand. She can cast them in any order, but since they're identical, it doesn't matter. But the first one cast would have X=2, the second X=3. So casting both is the way to go.

Wait, but is there a way for Bob to prevent the damage by using Orim's ability after the first Kindle is cast? But since it's Alice's turn, Bob can't activate Orim's ability. So no.

Wait, but let's consider if Bob could use Orim's ability during his own turn. But the problem states it's Alice's turn. So Bob's turn hasn't come yet. So during Alice's turn, Bob can't do anything. So the damage from Alice's spells will be dealt before Bob gets a chance to activate Orim's ability. So even if Bob wanted to, he can't prevent the damage because it's Alice's turn.

Therefore, the conclusion is that Alice should cast both Kindles, and Orim dies. Bob can't prevent it, so his optimal play is to do nothing.

Wait, but let me check if there's a rule about "this turn" in the ability. The ability says "Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So "this turn" is the turn when the ability is activated. If Bob activates it during his own turn, then "this turn" would be his turn, not Alice's. But since it's Alice's turn, if Bob could activate it, "this turn" would be Alice's turn. But he can't activate it during Alice's turn, so the ability isn't active. So no prevention.

Another check: if Bob had activated Orim's ability during his own turn, then "this turn" would be his turn, so it would prevent damage during his turn. But since it's Alice's turn, and Bob hasn't activated it yet, the ability isn't active. So Alice's damage is not prevented.

Therefore, the optimal play for Alice is to cast both Kindles, dealing 5 damage, killing Orim. Bob has no actions, so he does nothing.

Wait, but the problem says "Bob has no cards in hand, but has a Orim, Samite Healer in play, untapped." So Orim is untapped, but Bob can't tap it because he can't activate the ability. So Orim remains untapped, but that's irrelevant.

Wait, but let's confirm the damage calculation. First Kindle: 2 damage (since 0 Kindles in graveyard). Second Kindle: 3 damage (1 Kindle in graveyard). Total 5. Orim has 3 toughness, so 5 > 3, so it dies. Correct.

Is there any chance that the damage from the two spells is considered as a single instance? Like, if you cast two spells, does the damage count as one instance? No, each spell is a separate instance. So the first Kindle is one damage instance (2), the second is another (3). So the prevention would apply to the first 3 damage across both instances. But since Bob can't prevent it, it's all dealt.

Wait, but if Bob could prevent it, the first 3 damage would be prevented. So the first Kindle's 2 is prevented, and 1 of the second Kindle's 3 is prevented, so the second Kindle deals 2. Total damage 2. But since Bob can't prevent it, it's 5.

But since Bob can't prevent it, Alice wins.

Wait, but the problem says "optimal play for both players." So Alice's optimal play is to cast both Kindles. Bob's optimal play is to do nothing, since he can't do anything else.

Wait, but maybe there's a trick here. Let me check the exact wording of Kindle. "Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards."

Wait, "all graveyards" – so it's the total number of Kindle cards in both players' graveyards. But Alice has two Kindles in hand, so no Kindles in graveyards initially. So when she casts the first Kindle, it's 2 + 0 = 2. Then, the first Kindle goes to the graveyard. Now, when she casts the second Kindle, the number of Kindles in all graveyards is 1 (only the first Kindle), so X=3. So that's correct.

Is there a possibility that the second Kindle counts the first Kindle in the graveyard, but since it's the same card, but no, the card name is "Kindle," so both copies are named Kindle. So the count is 1.

Wait, but the problem says "two copies of 'Kindle'." So they're both named "Kindle," so they count towards the number. So yes, the second Kindle sees one Kindle in the graveyard.

Another check: if Alice casts one Kindle, it's 2 damage. Then, if she doesn't cast the second, Orim has 1 toughness left. But she wants to kill it, so she needs to cast both.

Wait, but the problem states "Alice has (only) two cards in her hand," so she can't cast anything else. So she has to choose between casting one or both. Casting both is better.

So the optimal play for Alice is to cast both Kindles. Bob can't do anything, so his optimal play is to do nothing.

Wait, but the problem says "optimal play for both players," so maybe Bob has a way to prevent it. But according to the rules, he can't. So the answer should be that Alice casts both Kindles, and Orim dies.

Wait, but let me check if Orim's ability can be activated during the resolution of a spell. For example, when Alice is casting a spell, can Bob respond by activating Orim's ability? But in Magic, players get priority after each spell is cast. So when Alice casts the first Kindle, it goes on the stack. Then, Bob gets priority. Can Bob activate Orim's ability during his priority? Wait, but it's Alice's turn, so Bob has priority after Alice casts a spell. So when Alice casts the first Kindle, it's on the stack. Then, Bob can choose to activate Orim's ability before the Kindle resolves.

Wait, this is a key point I might have missed. In Magic, after a player casts a spell, the active player (Alice) gets priority, then the non-active player (Bob) gets priority. So when Alice casts the first Kindle, it's on the stack. Then, Bob can choose to activate Orim's ability (if he can) before the Kindle resolves.

But can Bob activate Orim's ability during his own priority? Yes, because he has priority. So the sequence would be:

1. Alice casts first Kindle (2 damage, but it's on the stack).
2. Bob has priority. He can activate Orim's ability: tap Orim, which prevents the next 3 damage this turn.
3. Then, Alice has priority, and she can choose to let the Kindle resolve or not. But she wants to deal damage, so she lets it resolve.
4. The Kindle resolves, dealing 2 damage. But the prevention from Orim's ability prevents the next 3 damage, so this 2 damage is prevented.
5. Then, Alice casts the second Kindle (3 damage).
6. Bob has priority again. He can't activate Orim's ability again because it's a one-time effect. The ability says "prevent the next 3 damage," so it's a single prevention. So the ability is already used, so Bob can't prevent more damage.
7. The second Kindle resolves, dealing 3 damage. Since the prevention was already used (the next 3 damage was prevented, which was the 2 from the first Kindle), the 3 damage from the second Kindle is not prevented. So Orim takes 3 damage. Orim has 3 toughness, so it dies.

Wait, but hold on. If Bob activates Orim's ability during his priority after the first Kindle is cast, then the ability is active, and it prevents the next 3 damage. So when the first Kindle resolves, it deals 2 damage, which is prevented. Then, when the second Kindle resolves, it deals 3 damage. The prevention was for the next 3 damage, which was already used up by the 2 damage from the first Kindle. So the remaining 1 damage from the prevention is gone, so the 3 damage from the second Kindle is not prevented. So Orim takes 3 damage, which kills it (since it's 3 toughness).

Wait, but the ability says "prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So "the next 3 damage" means the first 3 damage that would be dealt. So the first 3 damage is prevented. So if the first Kindle deals 2, that's 2 of the 3, so the next 1 damage is prevented. Then, the second Kindle deals 3 damage, so the first 1 of that 3 is prevented, and the remaining 2 is dealt. So total damage dealt is 2. Wait, but Orim has 3 toughness, so 2 damage would leave it at 1 toughness, not dead.

Wait, let's clarify. The prevention is applied to the damage as it's being dealt. So when the first Kindle is resolving, it's about to deal 2 damage. The prevention effect is active, so it prevents that 2 damage. So 0 damage is dealt. Then, the second Kindle is resolving, about to deal 3 damage. The prevention effect is still active (since it's "the next 3 damage," which hasn't been fully used yet). Wait, no. The ability says "prevent the next 3 damage," so it's a single prevention of up to 3 damage. So the total damage prevented is 3. So if the first damage is 2, that's 2 prevented, and then the next 1 damage is prevented. So the second Kindle's damage is 3, so 1 is prevented, 2 is dealt. So total damage dealt is 2. So Orim takes 2 damage, reducing its toughness from 3 to 1. So it's not dead.

Wait, but that's if Bob activates the ability. So let's walk through the timing step by step.

- Alice casts first Kindle (targeting Orim). The spell is on the stack.
- Bob has priority. He can activate Orim's ability: tap Orim, which triggers the prevention of the next 3 damage this turn.
- Now, the prevention effect is active.
- Alice has priority. She can choose to let the Kindle resolve or not. She wants to deal damage, so she lets it resolve.
- The Kindle resolves: it's supposed to deal 2 damage to Orim. But the prevention effect prevents the next 3 damage, so this 2 damage is prevented. So Orim takes 0 damage.
- Now, the stack is empty (since the Kindle resolved), and it's Alice's turn. She casts the second Kindle (targeting Orim). The spell is on the stack.
- Bob has priority. He can't activate Orim's ability again because it's a one-time effect. The ability says "prevent the next 3 damage," which has already been partially used (2 damage prevented), so the remaining 1 damage is prevented. But the ability is a single effect, so it's a single prevention of up to 3 damage. So the prevention is a single instance that prevents up to 3 damage. So the total damage prevented is 3. So the first 2 damage is prevented, and the next 1 damage is prevented. So when the second Kindle is resolving, it's about to deal 3 damage. The prevention effect will prevent the next 1 damage (since 2 have already been prevented), so 1 damage is prevented, and 2 damage is dealt.
- So Orim takes 2 damage. Orim's toughness was 3, so now it's 1. It's not dead.

Wait, but that's a problem. So if Bob activates Orim's ability, then Orim only takes 2 damage, so it survives. But if Bob doesn't activate it, Orim takes 5 damage and dies. So Bob's optimal play is to activate Orim's ability, which would prevent the damage and save Orim.

But earlier I thought Bob couldn't activate the ability during his priority. But in Magic, when a spell is on the stack, the non-active player (Bob) gets priority before the spell resolves. So Bob can choose to activate Orim's ability during his priority, which would prevent the damage from the Kindle.

So the key point I missed earlier is that Bob can activate Orim's ability during his own priority, which is after Alice casts the spell but before it resolves. So Bob can prevent the damage from the first Kindle, and possibly part of the second.

Wait, let's confirm the priority order. When Alice casts a spell, it's placed on the stack. Then, the active player (Alice) gets priority. She can choose to do nothing, or cast another spell, or pass. Then, the non-active player (Bob) gets priority. Bob can choose to activate abilities, cast spells, etc. So after Alice casts the first Kindle, Bob gets priority. Bob can activate Orim's ability (tap Orim, which is a cost, so he has to tap it), which will prevent the next 3 damage this turn.

So Bob's optimal play is to activate Orim's ability. Then, when the first Kindle resolves, the 2 damage is prevented. Then, when Alice casts
