This series of emojis appears to be a simplified representation of the story of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." It's a well-known fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm, and a popular version was produced by Disney as an animated film. 

Here's a breakdown:
- The first line represents the Queen (or stepmother) in her castle, being jealous of Snow White's beauty.
- The second line shows the Queen consulting the magic mirror, which always proclaims Snow White as the fairest.
- The third line symbolizes the Queen, now the witch, giving Snow White the poisoned apple, leading to her apparent death.
- The fourth line represents the animals and Snow White sleeping, likely in her glass coffin.
- The last line is the Prince finding Snow White, waking her with a kiss, and their subsequent love and marriage. 

It's a common reference in popular culture, with the story being retold and reinterpreted in various forms of media. [end of text]
