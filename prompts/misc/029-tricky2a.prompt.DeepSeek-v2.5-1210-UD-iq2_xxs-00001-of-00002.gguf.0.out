Bob is right. While it's true that water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure, water can freeze at temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius as well. The process of freezing occurs when the temperature drops below the freezing point, regardless of whether it's -10 degrees or any other temperature below 0 degrees Celsius. Therefore, both Alice and Bob are correct in their statements, but Bob's statement is more inclusive of the broader concept of freezing. [end of text]
