A) **Yes**, water *can* freeze at –12 °C — but only if it’s pure and undisturbed, and nucleation (the start of ice formation) occurs. However, pure water can remain liquid below 0 °C due to supercooling.

B) If your glass of **pure water** is cooled slowly and carefully to –12 °C *without disturbance or nucleation sites*, it may remain liquid (supercooled). But the slightest disturbance (e.g., shaking, adding a speck of dust, or tapping the glass) will likely cause rapid freezing, as –12 °C is well below the equilibrium freezing point (0 °C). In practice, with typical impurities or container surfaces, it will probably freeze. [end of text]
