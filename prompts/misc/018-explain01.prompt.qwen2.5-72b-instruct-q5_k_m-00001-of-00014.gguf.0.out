Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, I'm 'bout to drop some knowledge,
Talk 'bout the Fed, the big boss of the dough, the money,
They control the cash, like the DJ controls the beat,
Keep the economy steady, so we can all eat.

(Chorus)
The Fed, the Fed, they keep it real,
Making sure the cash flows, so we can feel,
The Fed, the Fed, they got the power,
Keep the economy strong, like a tower.

(Verse 2)
They set the rates, like the tempo of the track,
If it's too high, it's a strain, if it's too low, it's a lack,
They make sure the banks ain't got no hiccups,
So the money moves smooth, like a hip-hop jump.

(Verse 3)
When the economy's down, they step in with a plan,
Like a DJ scratching, they flip the script, man,
They print more cash, or they lend it out,
To keep the game moving, no doubt.

(Verse 4)
They watch the inflation, like a hawk in the sky,
Make sure prices don't go up, so we can buy,
They're the guardians of the green, the dough, the cheddar,
Keep the economy balanced, like a perfect letter.

(Chorus)
The Fed, the Fed, they keep it real,
Making sure the cash flows, so we can feel,
The Fed, the Fed, they got the power,
Keep the economy strong, like a tower.

(Outro)
So when you hear about the Fed, you know the deal,
They're the ones who keep the economy on the real,
Making sure we all can live, work, and play,
The Fed, the Fed, they got the way. [end of text]
