(Beat drops)

Yo, listen up, let me break it down,  
Federal Reserve, it's like the sound  
Of the city's heartbeat, keepin' the flow,  
Makin' sure the dough moves, slow or go.

They're the big boss, the main man,  
Control the cash, like a DJ with a plan.  
They set the rates, like the tempo in a track,  
Keep the economy on track, no need to backtrack.

When the streets get rough, they step in,  
Like a OG, they got the game in their skin.  
They print the money, they lend it out,  
Keep the banks in check, no doubt.

They watch the inflation, like the heat in the club,  
Make sure it's just right, not too much, not too rub.  
They're the ones who got the power,  
To make the economy roar, hour after hour.

So when you hear 'Fed', think of the crew,  
Keepin' the economy movin', like a fresh new shoe.  
They're the backbone, the support,  
Without 'em, the game might just report.
