Based on the lyrics provided, here is an interpretation of the story. You are correct that while the tone is whimsical and the setting fantastical, the narrative follows a very literal, albeit supernatural, logic.

### The Story: The Banquet of the Departed

The song tells the story of a **ghostly restaurant hidden deep in the forest**, which serves as a waystation or final celebration for spirits who have recently passed away (or perhaps those who are about to).

Here is the breakdown of the narrative arc:

**1. The Impossible Journey**
> *"Following acorns won't get you there... You arrive from the person you forgot."*

The restaurant cannot be found by physical means (following acorns implies a Hansel and Gretel-style trail, which fails here). It exists in a liminal space. The line about arriving from "the person you forgot" suggests that this place is accessed through memory, regret, or the moment when the living finally let go of the dead. It is a place for souls, not the living.

**2. The Empty yet Full Atmosphere**
> *"No reservations... Empty seats during lunch... Little birds laughing."*

The restaurant appears empty to the living eye because the patrons are invisible spirits. The "little birds laughing" adds to the mischievous, eerie atmosphere, hinting that nature knows a secret that humans do not. The lack of reservations implies that death (or the arrival of a spirit) cannot be scheduled; you simply arrive when your time is up.

**3. The Surreal Service**
> *"Bright red tin roof... Menu is just 'Recommendations'... Violin, flute, cello, viola from the kitchen."*

The setting is vividly cartoonish (the bright red roof), fitting the "lighthearted" melody. The music coming from the *kitchen* rather than a stage suggests that the preparation of the meal is itself a symphony, or perhaps the chefs are magical creatures. The limited menu ("just recommendations") implies that the spirits don't choose their fate; they are served what is destined for them.

**4. The Trap of Comfort**
> *"Welcome, welcome... Eat your fill and then sleep... See you tomorrow, et cetera."*

This is the core of the "mischievous" tone. The host invites the spirits to feast. The phrase "Eat your fill and then sleep" is a gentle euphemism for the final rest of death. The line "See you tomorrow, et cetera" is ironic; for the dead, there is no "tomorrow" in the human sense. It's a polite dismissal into eternity, treating the end of existence as casually as closing a shop for the night.

**5. The Final Course**
> *"From right to left, oh my... Even the hand-sized bear cub dances... No dessert... We'll deliver it to inside the grave... Tonight is the last full course."*

The chaos of the dance (bears, food flying) represents the celebration of life before the final silence. The crucial literal twist comes here: **"There is no dessert."** In a normal restaurant, dessert is the end. Here, the absence of dessert signifies that the meal *is* the end.

The line **"We'll deliver it to inside the grave"** confirms the literal interpretation. The food being served isn't just sustenance; it is a ritual offering or the final experiences of the soul being packed away into the grave. The "Last Full Course" is the funeral rite itself, disguised as a whimsical dinner.

### Conclusion: Literal vs. Metaphorical

You asked for an interpretation that makes **literal sense in a fantastical setting**.

*   **The Literal Fantastical Interpretation:** This is a real restaurant located in a spirit dimension. The patrons are actual ghosts/spirits. The "food" is likely spiritual energy or memories. The staff (perhaps spirits themselves or magical entities like the dancing bear) serve a final meal to souls before they are physically buried or move on to the afterlife. The "delivery to the grave" is a literal service provided by the restaurant: they ensure the soul is fully satisfied and ready before being interred.
*   **The Tone:** The song uses a cheerful, bouncy melody to mask the morbid reality. It frames death not as a tragedy, but as a cozy, slightly chaotic dinner party where everyone is full, happy, and ready to "sleep" forever. The "mischievous" element is the trickery of the setting: it looks like a fun lunch spot, but it is actually the gateway to the grave.

It is a **funeral banquet sung by the undertakers (or spirits) to the deceased**, telling them: "Enjoy this last magical meal, dance with the bears, and don't worry about tomorrow, because you are going straight into the earth, fully fed and happy." [end of text]
