Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Give me your interpretation. You do not have to translate the contents, but you may if you wish.

The lyrics describe a whimsical and fantastical setting, where a small restaurant in a forest is the center of the story. The restaurant is always full of customers, but there are no reservations, and the menu is limited to recommendations. The music playing in the background is a mix of classical instruments like the violin, flute, cello, and viola.

The story could be interpreted as a metaphor for a place where people can escape from their daily lives and find comfort and companionship. The small restaurant could represent a safe haven where people can let go of their worries and enjoy the moment.

However, there is also a literal interpretation that makes sense in a fantastical setting. The restaurant could be a place where people can travel to from their own world, and it could be a place where they can meet and interact with other creatures from different realms. The small restaurant could be a neutral ground where people from different worlds can come together and share a meal.

The lyrics mention that the restaurant is always full of customers, but there are no reservations, which could suggest that the restaurant is a place where anyone can come and go as they please, regardless of their background or status. The menu is limited to recommendations, which could suggest that the restaurant serves dishes that are unique to the forest and cannot be found anywhere else.

The lyrics also mention that the music playing in the background is a mix of classical instruments, which could suggest that the restaurant is a place where people can enjoy the beauty of music and art. The final line, "Let's reach the grave together," could be interpreted as a metaphor for the end of a journey or a life, or it could be a literal statement about the restaurant's location in the forest.

Overall, the lyrics create a sense of wonder and mystery, and they invite the listener to imagine a world where anything is possible. The small restaurant in the forest could be a place where people can escape from their daily lives and find comfort and companionship, or it could be a place where they can meet and interact with other creatures from different realms. The lyrics leave it up to the listener to decide what the story means to them. [end of text]
