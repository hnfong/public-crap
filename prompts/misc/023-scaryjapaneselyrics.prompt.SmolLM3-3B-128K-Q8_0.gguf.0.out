The lyrics tell a story that can be interpreted in a fantastical setting. Here's a possible interpretation:

The song describes a whimsical and slightly mischievous journey through a fantastical forest. The narrator attempts to find a small restaurant in the forest, but it seems elusive. They poke around, trying to find it, and eventually stumble upon it. The restaurant is empty, with empty seats scattered around, and the atmosphere is lively with small birds chirping and laughing.

The restaurant is decorated with a bright red tin roof, and the menu is dominated by recommendations. The kitchen is filled with the sounds of a violin, flute, cello, and viola, creating a magical ambiance.

The narrator greets the guests warmly, suggesting that they should enjoy the food and then take a nap. However, they then say goodbye, and the guests depart, promising to return another day.

The song then shifts to a playful, almost dance-like rhythm, with the narrator describing a procession of people moving from one side of the room to the other. Even a hand-drawn bear joins in, dancing along with the guests. The menu includes dishes like carpaccio, pappardelle, and omelette, followed by risotto and dessert, which is not available. The narrator then suggests that the food should be served all the way to the grave, and the evening is described as the last full course.

This interpretation weaves together elements of a fantastical forest, a mysterious restaurant, and a lively, mischievous atmosphere, with a touch of whimsy and playfulness. The song seems to celebrate the joy of discovery, the magic of the unknown, and the lightheartedness of the journey. [end of text]
