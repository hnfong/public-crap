**Conflicts:**

1. **Global Climate Forum** (2023-05-15, 10:00–18:00) conflicts with **Tech Innovators Summit** (2023-05-15, 09:00–17:00). Both are full-day events on the same day with overlapping times.

2. **Annual Charity Gala** (2023-06-01, 19:00–01:00) overlaps with **Midnight Music Festival** (2023-06-01, 22:00–04:00). The Gala runs from 19:00 to 01:00 (next day), and the Festival starts at 22:00, so they overlap from 22:00 to 01:00.

3. **Creative Writing Retreat** (2023-07-10, 14:00–12:00) overlaps with **Digital Marketing Workshop** (2023-07-10, 13:00–16:00). The retreat starts at 14:00 on the 10th and runs until 12:00 on the 12th, meaning it overlaps with the workshop on the 10th from 14:00 to 16:00.

4. **Startup Pitch Night** (2023-08-05, 18:00–21:00) conflicts with **Investor Networking Mixer** (2023-08-05, 19:00–22:00). They overlap from 19:00 to 21:00.

5. **AI Ethics Symposium** (2023-09-12, 09:30–16:30) overlaps with **Machine Learning Bootcamp** (2023-09-12, 10:00–17:00). They overlap from 10:00 to 16:30.

6. **Book Launch: "The Future"** (2023-10-20, 18:00–20:00) conflicts with **Author Meet & Greet** (2023-10-20, 19:00–21:00). They overlap from 19:00 to 20:00.

7. **Winter Wonderland Market** (2023-12-01, 10:00–18:00) overlaps with **Holiday Party** (2023-12-01, 19:00–01:00). While they don't overlap in time, the Market ends at 18:00 and the Party starts at 19:00, so there is no conflict here. Wait, I need to correct this — there is no conflict between these two. Let me check again. Actually, I made an error in my analysis. Let me re-evaluate.

   - **Winter Wonderland Market**: 10:00–18:00
   - **Holiday Party**: 19:00–01:00 (next day)
   - No overlap. I apologize for the confusion. However, there is a conflict between **New Year's Eve Gala** (2023-12-31, 20:00–02:00) and **New Year's Day Brunch** (2024-01-01, 10:00–14:00)? No, these are on different days. Let me check again.

   Actually, let's look at **New Year's Eve Gala** (2023-12-31, 20:00–02:00) and **New Year's Day Brunch** (2024-01-01, 10:00–14:00). They are on different days, so no conflict.

   Wait, I see **Spring Flower Show** (2024-04-15, 09:00–17:00) and **Gardening Workshop** (2024-04-15, 14:00–16:00). These overlap from 14:00 to 16:00. Yes, that's a conflict.

   Also, **International Film Festival** (2024-05-22, 10:00–23:00) runs until 23:00 each day, and **Indie Film Screening** (2024-05-24, 18:00–21:00) is on the 24th, which is within the festival dates. So they overlap on 2024-05-24 from 18:00 to 21:00.

   **Summer Sports Tournament** (2024-07-01, 08:00–20:00) runs daily until July 5th, and **Marathon** (2024-07-03, 06:00–12:00) is on July 3rd, so they overlap from 08:00 to 12:00 on that day.

   **Science Fair** (2024-08-10, 09:00–17:00) and **Robotics Competition** (2024-08-10, 10:00–18:00) overlap from 10:00 to 17:00.

   **Art Exhibition Opening** (2024-09-05, 18:00–22:00) and **Gallery Tour** (2024-09-05, 19:00–21:00) overlap from 19:00 to 21:00.

   **Online Gaming Championship** (2024-10-31, 12:00–12:00) runs for 24 hours, and **Halloween Party** (2024-10-31, 20:00–02:00) overlaps from 20:00 on the 31st to 02:00 on November 1st, which is within the championship timeframe.

   **Black Friday Sale** (2024-11-29, 00:00–23:59) and **Cyber Monday Deals** (2024-12-02, 00:00–23:59) are on different days, so no conflict there.

So, the conflicts are:
- Global Climate Forum & Tech Innovators Summit
- Annual Charity Gala & Midnight Music Festival
- Creative Writing Retreat & Digital Marketing Workshop
- Startup Pitch Night & Investor Networking Mixer
- AI Ethics Symposium & Machine Learning Bootcamp
- Book Launch & Author Meet & Greet
- Spring Flower Show & Gardening Workshop
- International Film Festival & Indie Film Screening
- Summer Sports Tournament & Marathon
- Science Fair & Robotics Competition
- Art Exhibition Opening & Gallery Tour
- Online Gaming Championship & Halloween Party

I apologize for the confusion in my initial analysis. The list above is accurate.
