If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

When a theory proves itself, it can be described in different ways depending on the context. Here are some clarifications:

1. **Consistency**: A theory is consistent if it does not prove both a statement and its negation. In other words, a consistent theory cannot derive a contradiction. A theory that proves itself is not necessarily inconsistent, but it might be trivially consistent if it proves everything.

2. **Tautology**: A tautology is a statement that is always true, regardless of the interpretation. In the context of a theory, if the theory proves itself, it might be considered tautological in the sense that it is always true within its own framework. However, the term "tautological" is more commonly used to describe statements rather than entire theories.

3. **Trivial Theory**: A theory that proves itself and everything else is often called a trivial theory. In such a theory, every statement is provable, including its own negation. This is a form of inconsistency, but it's a specific kind of inconsistency where the theory is too weak to distinguish between true and false statements.

### Examples of Such Theories

1. **Trivial Theory**: Consider a theory with a single axiom that is a tautology, such as \(P \rightarrow P\). If this theory also includes a rule that allows it to prove any statement from this axiom, it becomes trivial. In this case, the theory proves itself and every other statement, making it inconsistent in the sense that it cannot distinguish between true and false statements.

2. **Self-Referential Theory**: A theory that includes a statement like "This theory is consistent" and has a rule that allows it to prove such self-referential statements can be problematic. If the theory is consistent, it will prove itself to be consistent, but if it is inconsistent, it will also prove itself to be consistent. This is a form of self-referential paradox.

3. **Classical Logic with a Tautology**: Consider a theory in classical logic that includes a tautology like \(P \lor \neg P\) (the law of excluded middle). If the theory is constructed in such a way that it can prove this tautology and any other statement derived from it, it becomes trivial in the sense that it proves everything.

4. **Paraconsistent Logic**: In paraconsistent logic, a theory can be inconsistent without being trivial. For example, a theory that includes both a statement and its negation but still allows for meaningful distinctions between true and false statements. However, if such a theory proves itself, it might be considered trivial in the sense that it proves everything.

In summary, a theory that proves itself can be described as trivial, tautological, or consistent, depending on the context. However, if it proves everything, it is typically considered trivial and inconsistent in the sense that it cannot distinguish between true and false statements. 

For a more precise classification, it's important to consider the specific logical framework and the nature of the self-proof within that framework. [end of text]
