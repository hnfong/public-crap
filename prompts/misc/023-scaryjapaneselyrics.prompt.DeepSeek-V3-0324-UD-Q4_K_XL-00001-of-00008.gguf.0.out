Here’s an interpretation of the lyrics in a **literal, fantastical setting**:

### **The Story: A Mysterious Forest Restaurant for the Forgotten**  
The song describes a **small, eerie restaurant deep in the forest**, seemingly impossible to find by normal means ("even if you follow acorns, you won’t arrive"). It appears to cater to **those who have been forgotten**—perhaps lost travelers, spirits, or even the dead.  

- **Empty and Unseen**: The restaurant is always empty ("no reservations," "empty seats at lunchtime"), yet there’s an unsettling liveliness—birds laugh, a bear dances, and unseen musicians play (violin, flute, cello, viola).  
- **A Feast Before the End**: The menu is strange ("only recommendations"), and the final lines suggest a **last supper** ("tonight is the final full course," "we’ll deliver even to the grave").  
- **No Escape?** The cheerful tone contrasts with the implication that guests may not leave—after eating their fill, they’re told to sleep ("goodnight, everyone") and that "tomorrow is another day, et cetera," hinting at an endless cycle.  

### **Possible Literal Meaning in a Fantastical World**  
This could be:  
- A **restaurant for lost souls**, where the forgotten are lured in for one last meal before moving on (or being trapped).  
- A **yokai (supernatural) establishment**, like a *tengu* or *zashiki-warashi* gathering spot, where time and reality warp.  
- A **metaphor for death**, but in a literal fantasy world, it could be a waystation for spirits before the afterlife.  

The playful, mischievous melody contrasts with the dark undertones, making it feel like a **trickster spirit’s lure**—welcoming, but with hidden consequences.  

Would you like me to refine any part of this interpretation? [end of text]
