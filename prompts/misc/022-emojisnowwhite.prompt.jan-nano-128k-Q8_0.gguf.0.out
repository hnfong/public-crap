Okay, the user wants a story about Snow White, but I have to write it exclusively in emojis. Let me start by recalling the classic tale. Snow White is a princess with fair skin, a beautiful smile, and she's often associated with a dwarfs' cottage, a poisoned apple, and a queen who wants to kill her.

First, I need to represent the key elements with emojis. The princess can be 🧑‍♀️ with a crown, maybe 🌸 for her beauty. The dwarfs' cottage is a small house, so 🏠 with some 🧱 or 🧺. The queen is usually a villain, so 👑 with a crown and a 💀 for her evil nature. The mirror is a 🔍, and the poisoned apple is 🍎 with a 💀. The huntsman is 🐺, and the coffin is 🪦. The dwarfs' reaction is 😭 or 😢. The prince is 👑 with a heart, and the wedding is 🎉.

Wait, the user said the protagonist must resemble the classical tales, so I need to make sure the main character is clearly Snow White. Maybe start with her being born, so 🌟👶. Then the queen's jealousy, so 👑💥. The mirror test with the 🔍, then the poisoned apple 🍎💀. The huntsman 🐺, the coffin 🪦, the dwarfs' reaction 😭. The prince's rescue 👑❤️, the wedding 🎉, and the happy ending 🎉👨‍👩‍👧‍👦.

I should check if all the key elements are there. Maybe add some more details like the dwarfs' names or the setting, but since it's emojis, I can't use text. Use 🏠 for the cottage, maybe 🧱 for the dwarfs' tools. The apple is poisoned, so the 💀 emoji. The prince's heart is ❤️. The ending should be positive, so maybe 🌈 or 🌟 for the happy ending.

Wait, the user said "you may be creative as you want," so I can add some unique elements. Maybe the queen is a 👑 with a 💀, the dwarfs are 🧱 with a 🧺. The poisoned apple is 🍎💀. The huntsman is 🐺, and the coffin is 🪦. The prince is 👑❤️. The wedding is 🎉, and the happy ending is 🌈 or 🌟. 

I need to make sure the sequence flows. Start with Snow White's birth, then the queen's jealousy, the mirror, the apple, the huntsman, the dwarfs, the prince, the wedding, and the ending. Each part should be represented by emojis in a way that tells the story. Maybe use 🌟 for the beginning, then 👑💥 for the queen's anger. The mirror is 🔍, the apple is 🍎💀. The huntsman is 🐺, the coffin is 🪦. The dwarfs are 😭, the prince is 👑❤️, and the wedding is 🎉. Finally, the happy ending with 🌈 or 🌟.

I should also check for any possible mistakes. For example, the queen is usually a witch, but in the original, she's a queen. So maybe use 👑 for the queen. The dwarfs are often represented as 🧱, so that's good. The poisoned apple is a key element, so 🍎💀. The prince's rescue is important, so 👑❤️. The ending should show the happy conclusion, so maybe 🌈 or 🌟 with a family emoji.

I think that's all. Let me put it all together in a sequence that tells the story step by step.
