Alice is right. Water *typically* freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). 

Bob is trying to be tricky. While water *can* freeze at -10 degrees Celsius under specific conditions (like supercooling or high pressure), it doesn't *normally* freeze at that temperature. His statement is not generally true. 

Therefore, **Alice is correct.**
