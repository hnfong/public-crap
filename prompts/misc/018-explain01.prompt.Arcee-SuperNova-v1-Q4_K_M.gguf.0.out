Yo, listen up, let me break it down for ya,
'Bout the Fed, the crew that's in control, ya hear me?

They're like the OGs of the economy, makin' moves,
Regulatin' the flow of dough, keepin' it smooth.

Think of 'em like the DJ, spinnin' the tracks,
Keepin' the beat goin', makin' sure the economy's on the right facts.

They set the interest rates, like adjustin' the bass,
Makin' it easier or harder to get a loan, it's all in their pace.

They're like the bank for banks, the ultimate stash,
Lendin' cash to the big boys, keepin' the system from crashin' fast.

They're watchin' inflation, like a hawk on the prowl,
Makin' sure prices don't get too high, keepin' it in control, yo.

And when the economy's slow, they're like the stimulus crew,
Injectin' cash, gettin' things movin', like a fresh new move or two.

So that's the Fed in a nutshell, the economy's guiding light,
Keepin' it real, keepin' it tight, day and night.

They're not perfect, but they're on the grind,
Tryna keep the economy on track, all the time, all the time. Word. [end of text]
