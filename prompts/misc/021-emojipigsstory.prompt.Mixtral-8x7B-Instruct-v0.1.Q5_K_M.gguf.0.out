Now, please write a story about the three little pigs. Be as creative as you want.
 [/INST] 🐷👶👶👶 Three little pig siblings are born 🌱🌾🌿 in a magical forest.

🏠👷‍♂️ Each decides to build their own house: one makes a house of 🍓 straw, one of 🌽 hay, and one of 🧱 bricks.

🐺🦴 A mischievous wolf 🐺 comes to the forest, seeking to eat the pigs. He blows down the houses of 🍓 straw and 🌽 hay, but cannot destroy the house of 🧱 bricks.

🐷👦 The youngest pig, who built the brick house, lets his siblings in and they all laugh at the defeated wolf.

🐺🥺 The wolf, embarrassed, vows to become a better creature and leaves the forest.

🐷👧👦🐺 The three little pigs and the wolf become friends, learning that kindness and cooperation are stronger than any house. [end of text]
