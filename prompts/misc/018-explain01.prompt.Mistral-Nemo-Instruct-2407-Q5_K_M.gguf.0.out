Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

Yo, listen up, I'ma break it down simple, no jargon, just the real.
The Fed, that's the Federal Reserve, they like the money's DJ.
They control the beat, make sure the economy's flow ain't weak.
They print the cash, keep it circulating, make sure it ain't stuck.
Inflation, that's when prices rise, they try to keep it in check, like a hype man.
Interest rates, that's the price of borrowing, they set that too.
When they lower it, loans get cheaper, when they raise it, they get pricier, true.
They also act like a bank for banks, make sure they got enough cash.
In times of crisis, they step in, like a hero, save the day, no clash.
So, the Fed, they keep the economy moving, like a smooth track.
Without them, the beat would stop, and the whole system would crack.
