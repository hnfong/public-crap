Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (0°C) under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10 degrees Celsius, water is well below its freezing point and would be in a solid state (ice), not transitioning to ice. Bob's statement that "water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius" is incorrect because -10°C is already below the freezing point of water. Therefore, water would already be frozen at that temperature.
