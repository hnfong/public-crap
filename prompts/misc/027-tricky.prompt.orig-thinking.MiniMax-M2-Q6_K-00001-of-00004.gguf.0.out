I need to answer two questions about water freezing at -12 degrees Celsius. For A, I’ll explain that pure water typically freezes at 0°C, but it can supercool below that temperature without freezing until it reaches around -38°C. At -12°C, pure water can remain liquid if it's free of impurities and not disturbed. For B, I’ll describe that if a glass of pure water is cooled to -12°C, it might stay liquid unless nucleation occurs.

I need to explain that water can supercool to -12°C, but it will freeze if disturbed or if impurities are present. The freezing point depression formula shows that adding solutes lowers the freezing point. For pure water, the freezing point is 0°C, but it can supercool to about -38°C. At -12°C, pure water can remain liquid unless nucleation occurs. I’ll also mention that the triple point of water is at 0.01°C and 611.657 Pa, but I’ll keep the explanation brief.
