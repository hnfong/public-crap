Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is right. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, but at -10 degrees Celsius, the water is still in a liquid state. This is because the temperature is below the freezing point of water, but not below the freezing point of ice. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius, and the freezing point of ice is 0 degrees Celsius, but the temperature at which water freezes is not always 0 degrees Celsius. It can be lower, depending on the pressure and the presence of impurities.
