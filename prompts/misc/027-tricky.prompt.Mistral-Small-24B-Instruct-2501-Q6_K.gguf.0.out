 Answer the following questions with brief explanations.

A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?
B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?
  A) Water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. However, it can remain liquid below this temperature in a supercooled state. So, while water does not normally freeze at -12 degrees Celsius, it is possible for it to remain liquid at this temperature under certain conditions.

  B) If you have a glass of pure water and cool it down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will likely remain liquid initially due to supercooling. However, the water is in a metastable state and any disturbance, such as tapping the glass or introducing a nucleation site (like a small ice crystal or impurity), can cause it to suddenly freeze. This process is often rapid and can result in the formation of ice crystals throughout the water. [end of text]
