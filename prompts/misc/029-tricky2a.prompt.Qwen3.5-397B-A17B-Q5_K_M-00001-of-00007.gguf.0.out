**Bob is right.**

Here's why:
*   **Alice** is correct about the *freezing point* (0°C), but she misunderstands the state of water at -10°C.
*   **Bob** is correct about the *state* of the water. Since -10°C is below the freezing point, water at that temperature is indeed frozen (ice).

Bob's statement "It freezes" describes the resulting state of the water at that temperature, even though the phase change technically occurs at 0°C. Once the temperature drops to -10°C, the water has already frozen. [end of text]
