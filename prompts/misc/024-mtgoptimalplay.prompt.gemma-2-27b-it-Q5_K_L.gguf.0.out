Here's a breakdown of the optimal play for both Alice and Bob in this scenario:

**Alice's Thought Process:**

* **Goal:** Kill Orim, the primary threat to her burn strategy.
* **Resources:** Two Kindle spells.
* **Challenge:** Orim's ability can prevent 3 damage, making a single Kindle insufficient.

* **Solution:** Alice needs to cast both Kindle spells simultaneously. Since Kindle's damage is calculated based on the number of Kindles in *all* graveyards, casting both will result in each Kindle dealing 4 damage (2 base + 2 for the other Kindle in the graveyard).

**Bob's Thought Process:**

* **Goal:** Keep Orim alive to block Alice's burn strategy.
* **Resources:** Orim, Samite Healer, untapped.
* **Challenge:** Alice has enough damage potential to kill Orim.

* **Solution:** Bob's only option is to tap Orim to activate its ability and prevent the first 3 damage from one of the Kindles. This will leave Orim with 1 toughness, making it vulnerable to the second Kindle.

**Optimal Play:**

1. **Alice:** Cast both Kindle spells targeting Orim.
2. **Bob:** Tap Orim to prevent 3 damage from one of the Kindles.

**Outcome:**

* The first Kindle deals 4 damage, but 3 is prevented by Orim's ability, leaving Orim with 1 toughness.
* The second Kindle deals 4 damage, killing Orim.

**Explanation:**

This scenario highlights the importance of understanding how card abilities interact. Alice leverages the graveyard interaction of Kindle to maximize its damage output. Bob, despite having a powerful defensive creature, is unable to fully protect it due to the nature of Kindle's damage calculation.
