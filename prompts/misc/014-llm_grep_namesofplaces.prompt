I want you to perform a semantic "grep" given the input and a query/description.

For every line in the input, output the line or requested contents of the line
(together with line number) only if the line has something that matches the
given query/description, otherwise ignore the line. Only trigger when the input
obviously matches the query, i.e. not tangentially related.

- !! Query/Description of what we want: `names of countries or regions. only output the country/region names with line number, something like grep -n -o` !!

1: Let's Talk about Unfair Trade Restrictions
2: In today's world, it's hard to understand why countries impose extra restrictions on importing goods from nations they consider "unbalanced" in trade. This outdated practice hampers fair commerce and leads to smuggling.
3: 
4: Take Britain, for example. They allow Silesia lawns to be imported for personal consumption, but prohibit French cambrics and lawns, even if they're meant for export. The UK also imposes higher duties on French wine, while being lenient towards Portugal. This uneven treatment is not only unfair but also stifles trade.
5: 
6: Some argue that if Britain imports French goods, the balance of trade will shift in favor of France. But that's a flawed assumption. If French goods are cheaper and better quality, it's actually beneficial for Britain to buy from France, not Portugal or Germany. Moreover, many French goods could be re-exported to other countries, generating revenue for Britain.
7: 
8: Another issue is that there's no reliable way to determine which country has the "balance of trade" in their favor. National biases and prejudices often influence decisions, rather than objective facts. Custom-house books and the course of exchange are supposed to be indicators, but they're often inaccurate.
9: 
10: When the exchange rate between two countries is at par, it's said to indicate a balance. But when a premium is paid for a bill, it means one country has to send money to the other. This doesn't necessarily mean one country is exporting more than it imports.
11: 
12: It's time for countries to rethink these outdated trade restrictions and focus on fair, free, and open commerce.

16: The value of trade between two countries isn't always easy to determine. Just because one country usually pays its debts to another doesn't mean that the trade balance is in its favor. Imagine if England's merchants often pay for goods from Hamburg, Dantzic, and Riga using bills from Holland. This would affect the debt and credit balance between England and Holland, even if England's exports to Holland exceed its imports.
17: The way we calculate exchange rates can also be misleading. It's like saying that a country's currency is worth a certain amount based on its mint's standard, but this standard might not reflect the actual value of the currency. For example, before a coin reform in England, the value of the English currency was actually lower than its standard value. This means that the real exchange rate might be different from the calculated one.
18: 
19: Another issue is that the cost of coinage is different in each country. In England, the government covers the cost, but in France, individuals pay a duty of 8% for coinage. This makes French coins more valuable than English coins with the same amount of silver. So, even if the coins are near their standard values, a sum of English money couldn't buy an equal amount of French money.

If no lines match just give empty response. Don't explain. Just output as if
you're a command line program called "semantic_grep".

Important: after each line of output, also emit a "---" to separate it from
your next output.
