Here are the answers with brief explanations:

A) No, water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. -12 degrees Celsius is below the freezing point, but it's not the temperature at which water freezes.

B) If a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will likely remain in a supercooled state, meaning it will remain liquid below its freezing point. This is because the water molecules need a nucleation site, such as a tiny impurity or imperfection, to form ice crystals. If the water is pure and free of nucleation sites, it can remain liquid even below 0°C. However, if the water is disturbed or introduced to a nucleation site, it will rapidly freeze at -12°C.
