Let's break down the scenario step by step, referencing Magic: The Gathering (MTG) rules as of 2024.

## The Situation

**Alice's hand:**
- 2x Kindle (instant spell: "Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards.")

**Alice's board:** (not specified, but presumably no creatures, since she's focused on burning out Bob's Orim)

**Bob's board:**
- Orim, Samite Healer (1/3, tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn)
- Bob has no cards in hand
- Bob's lands are tapped out (can't produce mana this turn)

**Alice's goal:** Kill Orim before Bob can untap or do anything.

**Alice's resources:** Sufficient mana to cast any spells.

---

## Step 1: What Does Orim Do?

Orim's ability is:
> Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.

- This is a *state-based effect* that lasts for the rest of the turn after it's activated.
- It can be activated at any time Bob has priority, as long as Orim is untapped.
- However, **Bob's lands are tapped out**, so unless Orim was untapped at the start of his last turn or Bob has another way to untap, Orim is likely tapped already at the start of Alice's turn.
- But the problem says Orim is "untapped" and "has been on the board for a while (unaffected by summoning sickness)", so we'll assume Orim is currently untapped at the start of Alice's turn.

But let's clarify: At the start of Alice's turn, it's Bob's main phase, and Bob has no lands untapped (tapped out). That means Bob cannot activate Orim's ability unless he somehow gets mana or Orim is already untapped and Bob uses his available priority to tap it.

But the problem says "Orim is in play, untapped." So at the start of Alice's turn, Orim is untapped.

However, Bob has no lands untapped, so after Alice acts, Bob will not be able to tap Orim unless he draws a land or something else happens.

But for now, at the start of Alice's turn, Orim is untapped and Bob has no mana.

## Step 2: How Does Alice Kill Orim?

Alice's only cards are two Kindles. Let's see how much damage she can deal.

### How Much Damage Can Alice Deal With Two Kindles?

Let's track the number of Kindles in the graveyard as the sequence unfolds.

#### Option A: Cast One Kindle

- Cast Kindle, targeting Orim.
- X = 2 + number of Kindles in all graveyards (currently 0).
- So X = 2.
- Deal 2 damage to Orim.
- Orim is at 1 toughness. 2 damage would destroy it, but let's see if Orim can prevent the damage.

But Bob can activate Orim's ability **before** the damage is dealt, if he has priority and the ability is available.

But Bob is tapped out and has no cards in hand. Does he have any way to tap Orim? At the start of Alice's turn, Orim is untapped, and Bob has no mana. But Bob still has priority during Alice's turn before and after her spells resolve.

Let's walk through the sequence:

1. Alice has priority. She can cast Kindle.
2. Bob can respond (even if he can't cast spells, he can activate abilities if he can pay costs—here, tapping Orim is free).
3. So, before Kindle resolves, Bob can tap Orim to prevent the next 3 damage.

So, sequence:

- Alice casts Kindle, targeting Orim.
- Bob, on his priority, taps Orim to prevent the next 3 damage this turn.
- Now, when Kindle resolves, it tries to deal 2 damage to Orim.
- Orim's ability triggers: "Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."
- So, the 2 damage is prevented.
- Orim remains at 1/3.

So, **one Kindle is not enough** if Bob can tap Orim before the damage is dealt.

But can Bob do this? Let's check the timing:

- Alice casts Kindle (targeting Orim).
- Before the spell resolves, Bob can activate Orim's ability (it's free to tap, and he has priority).
- Then Kindle resolves, but Orim's prevention effect is active, so the 2 damage is prevented.

Yes, that's correct.

---

#### Option B: Cast Both Kindles in the Same Turn

Let's see if Alice can get more damage by casting both Kindles.

But each Kindle is an instant, so she can cast both in one turn if she has the mana.

But let's see the sequence:

##### Option B1: Cast both at once (stacking both)

But each is a separate spell. Let's see if she can get more damage by sequencing them.

##### Sequence 1: Cast first Kindle, then second Kindle

1. Alice casts first Kindle, targeting Orim.
2. Bob can tap Orim to prevent 3 damage.
3. First Kindle resolves: 2 damage is prevented.
4. Alice casts second Kindle, targeting Orim.
5. But Orim is now tapped (from Bob's earlier activation), so Bob cannot tap Orim again this turn (the ability is "tap: prevent...", and Orim is now tapped).
6. So, when the second Kindle resolves, Orim is tapped and cannot prevent more damage this turn.
7. Second Kindle deals 2 damage (since no Kindles are in the graveyard yet).
8. Orim takes 2 damage and is destroyed.

But wait: When does the second Kindle resolve? After the first one. But after Bob taps Orim to prevent the first 2 damage, Orim is tapped and cannot be tapped again this turn (unless an effect untaps it, which there isn't).

So, after the first Kindle is cast and Bob taps Orim, Orim is tapped. Bob cannot activate Orim's ability again this turn.

Therefore, when the second Kindle resolves, Orim cannot prevent any more damage.

But let's check: Does the number of Kindles in the graveyard affect the second Kindle's X value?

Let's track the graveyard:

- When the first Kindle is cast, it's not in the graveyard yet.
- When it resolves, if it deals damage or not, it will go to the graveyard after it resolves (unless it's countered or something else happens).
- So, when Alice casts the second Kindle, has the first Kindle already gone to the graveyard?

Let's clarify the timing:

- Alice casts first Kindle. (It's on the stack.)
- Bob taps Orim.
- First Kindle resolves: It deals (or is prevented from dealing) 2 damage.
- Then, the card is put into the graveyard (as it's an instant, it goes to the graveyard after resolving).
- Now, there is 1 Kindle in the graveyard.
- Alice casts second Kindle. At this point, there is 1 Kindle in the graveyard.
- So, X = 2 + 1 = 3.
- She targets Orim.
- Orim is tapped and cannot activate his ability again this turn.
- So, 3 damage is dealt to Orim.
- Orim is at 1 toughness, so 3 damage is more than enough to destroy it.

So, the sequence is:

1. Alice casts first Kindle (X=2, 0 in graveyard).
2. Bob taps Orim to prevent 3 damage.
3. First Kindle resolves: 2 damage is prevented. First Kindle goes to graveyard.
4. Alice casts second Kindle (now 1 Kindle in graveyard, so X=3).
5. Orim is tapped, cannot prevent more damage this turn.
6. Second Kindle resolves: 3 damage is dealt to Orim, destroying it.

**Result:** Orim is destroyed.

But let's check if Bob can do anything in between. After the first Kindle resolves and before the second is cast, Bob still has no mana and no untapped creatures (unless he has others, but only Orim is mentioned). So he cannot untap Orim or do anything else.

Therefore, this sequence works.

But is there a way for Bob to prevent this?

#### Could Bob have acted differently?

At step 2, when Alice casts the first Kindle, Bob could choose not to tap Orim, but that would allow the first Kindle to deal 2 damage and kill Orim immediately (since Orim is at 1 toughness). But Bob, playing optimally, will tap Orim to prevent that 2 damage.

But as above, after that, Orim is tapped and cannot prevent further damage.

So Bob cannot prevent both Kindles' damage.

#### What if Alice casts both Kindles at the same time (split second or otherwise)?

But in standard rules, you can't cast both at exactly the same time; you cast one, then the other.

But even if she tries to cast both at once (e.g., with split second or flash, but she doesn't have that here), the sequence is the same: Bob can only tap Orim once per turn.

So the above sequence is optimal for Alice.

## Step 3: Are There Any Other Considerations?

- **Does Orim's prevention stack?** No, it's a one-time "prevent the next 3 damage" per activation.
- **Does Orim's ability prevent all damage until the end of turn, or just the next 3 instances?** It's "the next 3 damage
