Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Certainly! The lyrics paint a whimsical and fantastical picture of a small, peculiar restaurant in the forest. Here’s an interpretation that makes literal sense within this fantastical setting:

### The Story of the Forest Restaurant

**Setting:**
The story takes place in a small, charming restaurant nestled deep in a forest. The restaurant has a distinctive red tin roof and is often empty, despite its inviting atmosphere. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous, reflecting the whimsical nature of the place.

**Plot:**
1. **Mysterious Location:**
   - The restaurant is hard to find. Even if you follow acorns (ドングリ), you won't reach it. This suggests that the restaurant is hidden or exists in a magical, elusive place.
   - The restaurant is often empty, with no reservations and plenty of empty seats, even during lunchtime. This adds to its mysterious and enchanting aura.

2. **Unusual Atmosphere:**
   - The restaurant is filled with a sense of whimsy and magic. Small birds flutter and laugh, adding to the playful ambiance.
   - The kitchen is the source of unusual sounds—violin, flute, cello, and viola. This suggests that the chefs or the kitchen staff are not ordinary and might be magical beings or creatures.

3. **Welcoming and Mysterious Host:**
   - The host or hostess greets guests warmly, inviting them to eat their fill and then take a nap. This could be a metaphor for the restaurant's magical properties, where guests are transported to a dreamlike state.
   - The hostess bids farewell with a cryptic message: "Tomorrow is another day, et cetera." This adds a layer of mystery and suggests that the experience at the restaurant is fleeting and unique to each visit.

4. **Magical Dining Experience:**
   - The dining experience is chaotic and lively. The guests move from right to left in a flurry, and even a small bear joins in the dance, indicating a magical and joyful atmosphere.
   - The menu is limited to a few recommended dishes, but the restaurant offers a full course meal, including carpaccio, paella, and appetizers. However, there are no desserts, which is unusual.
   - The restaurant promises to deliver the meal even to graves, suggesting that the food has the power to reach beyond the living world. This could be interpreted as the restaurant serving both the living and the dead, or it could be a metaphor for the meal being so memorable that it stays with you forever.

5. **Final Course:**
   - The evening ends with a grand final course, emphasizing the special and magical nature of the dining experience. The restaurant seems to offer a complete and unforgettable journey, from the moment you enter to the moment you leave.

### Interpretation:
The forest restaurant is a magical, hidden gem that exists in a realm of its own. It is a place where the boundaries between the real and the fantastical blur. The restaurant's elusive nature, the unusual sounds from the kitchen, the playful atmosphere, and the promise to deliver meals even to graves all contribute to a sense of enchantment and wonder. The dining experience is not just about the food but about the entire magical journey, which leaves a lasting impression on the guests.

This interpretation captures the literal sense of the lyrics within a fantastical setting, where the restaurant is a place of magic, mystery, and joy. [end of text]
