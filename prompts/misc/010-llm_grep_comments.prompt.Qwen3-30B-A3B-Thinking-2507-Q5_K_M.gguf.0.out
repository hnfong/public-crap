Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to perform a semantic "grep" on the given input, specifically looking for lines that contain comments. The query is "all lines with comments".

First, I need to understand what constitutes a comment in a shell script. In Bash, comments start with a '#' character. However, I should be careful not to include lines where '#' is part of a string or command, not a comment.

Looking at the input provided, each line has a number followed by the content. The task is to check each line for comments. Let's go through the lines one by one.

Line 1: #!/bin/bash – This is a shebang, which is a comment in the context of shell scripts. So this should be included.

Line 2: set -ex – No comment here.

Line 3: Empty line – Not a comment.

Line 4: # Save the path to ./download_check script – Starts with #, so it's a comment.

Line 5: script_path=$(python3 -c 'import os,sys; print(os.path.realpath(sys.argv[1]))' "$0") – No #, so not a comment.

Line 6: download_check_path=$(dirname "$script_path")/download_check – No comment.

Line 7: Empty line.

Line 8: function download_and_check() { – No comment.

Line 9: set -e – No comment.

Line 10: curl -C - -O -L "$1" – No comment.

Line 11: local my_filename=$(basename "$1") – No comment.

Line 12: "$download_check_path" "$my_filename" – No comment.

Line 13: } – No comment.

Line 14: Empty line.

Line 15: # This is a script to build and install tmux on macOS without homebrew. – Starts with #, so comment.

Line 16: prefix=$HOME/apps/tmux – No comment.

Line 17: mkdir -p "$prefix" – No comment.

Line 18: cd "$prefix" – No comment.

Line 19: Empty line.

Line 20: # Download and build pkg-config – Comment.

Line 21: download_and_check 'https://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/releases/pkg-config-0.29.2.tar.gz' – No comment.

Line 22: tar zxvf pkg-config-0.29.2.tar.gz – No comment.

Line 23: cd pkg-config-0.29.2 – No comment.

Line 24: CFLAGS="-Wno-int-conversion" ./configure --prefix="$prefix" --with-internal-glib – No comment.

Line 25: make -j 10 – No comment.

Line 26: make install – No comment.

Line 27: cd .. – No comment.

Line 28: Empty line.

Line 29: # Download and build ncurses – Comment.

Line 30: download_and_check 'https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ncurses/ncurses-6.5.tar.gz' – No comment.

Line 31: tar zxvf ncurses-6.5.tar.gz – No comment.

Line 32: cd ncurses-6.5 – No comment.

Line 33: ./configure --prefix="$prefix" – No comment.

Line 34: make -j 10 – No comment.

Line 35: make install – No comment.

Line 36: cd .. – No comment.

Line 37: Empty line.

Line 38: # Download and build libevent – Comment.

Line 39: download_and_check 'https://github.com/libevent/libevent/releases/download/release-2.1.12-stable/libevent-2.1.12-stable.tar.gz' – No comment.

Line 40: tar zxvf libevent-2.1.12-stable.tar.gz – No comment.

Line 41: cd libevent-2.1.12-stable – No comment.

Line 42: ./configure --disable-openssl --prefix="$prefix" – No comment.

Line 43: make -j 10 – No comment.

Line 44: make install – No comment.

Line 45: cd .. – No comment.

Line 46: Empty line.

Line 47: Empty line.

Line 48: # Download and build utf8proc – Comment.

Line 49: download_and_check 'https://github.com/JuliaStrings/utf8proc/releases/download/v2.9.0/utf8proc-2.9.0.tar.gz' – No comment.

Line 50: tar zxvf utf8proc-2.9.0.tar.gz – No comment.

Line 51: cd utf8proc-2.9.0 – No comment.

Line 52: make prefix="$prefix" – No comment.

Line 53: make install prefix="$prefix" – No comment.

Line 54: cd .. – No comment.

Line 55: Empty line.

Line 56: # Download and build tmux – Comment.

Line 57: download_and_check 'https://github.com/tmux/tmux/releases/download/3.5a/tmux-3.5a.tar.gz' – No comment.

Line 58: tar zxvf tmux-3.5a.tar.gz – No comment.

Line 59: cd tmux-3.5a – No comment.

Line 60: PKG_CONFIG="$prefix"/bin/pkg-config ./configure --enable-utf8proc --prefix="$prefix" – No comment.

Line 61: make -j 10 – No comment.

Line 62: make install – No comment.

Line 63: cd .. – No comment.

Line 64: Empty line.

Line 65: ln -sf "$prefix"/bin/tmux ~/bin/tmux – No comment.

Now, compiling the lines that are comments:

Line 1: #!/bin/bash

Line 4: # Save the path to ./download_check script

Line 15: # This is a script to build and install tmux on macOS without homebrew.

Line 20: # Download and build pkg-config

Line 29: # Download and build ncurses

Line 38: # Download and build libevent

Line 48: # Download and build utf8proc

Line 56: # Download and build tmux

Wait, line 1 is a shebang. In shell scripts, the shebang is a comment, but sometimes people might not consider it a comment. However, the problem states "all lines with comments", and the shebang line starts with #, so it's technically a comment. The user's instruction says "not tangentially related", but shebang is a standard comment line in shell scripts. So I should include it.

Double-checking line 1: #!/bin/bash – yes, the # is the comment character here, so it's a comment line.

Now, the user said "Only trigger when the input obviously matches the query, i.e. not tangentially related." So lines that are comments, even if they're shebang, should be included.

So the matching lines are 1,4,15,20,29,38,48,56.

Wait, line 15 is a comment, yes. Let me confirm each:

Line 1: #!/bin/bash – comment.

Line 4: # Save the path... – comment.

Line 15: # This is a script... – comment.

Line 20: # Download and build pkg-config – comment.

Line 29: # Download and build ncurses – comment.

Line 38: # Download and build libevent – comment.

Line 48: # Download and build utf8proc – comment.

Line 56: # Download and build tmux – comment.

All these lines start with #, so they are comments. The other lines either have no # or the # is part of a string (but in this input, I don't see any lines where # is inside a string, like in a quoted string). For example, line 5 has a # inside a Python command, but it's inside single quotes, so it's not a comment. So those lines shouldn't be included.

So the lines to output are 1,4,15,20,29,38,48,56.

Now, the output should be each line with its number, followed by "---".

Wait, the user says "output the line (together with line number) only if the line has something that matches the query". So for each matching line, output "line_number:line_content" followed by "---".

Wait, the input lines are numbered like "1:#!/bin/bash", so the line number is part of the input. But the user's instruction says "output the line (together with line number)", so probably output the line number as given in the input, followed by the line content.

Wait, looking at the input format, each line starts with the line number followed by a colon. For example, "1:#!/bin/bash". So when the user says "output the line (together with line number)", they probably want the line as it appears in the input, including the line number.

Wait, the input is given as:

1:#!/bin/bash
2:set -ex
...

So the line numbers are part of the input. So when the user says "output the line (together with line number)", they want the entire line as it appears in the input, which includes the line number.

Therefore, for each matching line, output the line exactly as it appears in the input, followed by "---".

So for line 1, output "1:#!/bin/bash" followed by "---".

Similarly, line 4: "4:# Save the path to ./download_check script" followed by "---".

So the correct output should be:

1:#!/bin/bash
---
4:# Save the path to ./download_check script
---
15:# This is a script to build and install tmux on macOS without homebrew.
---
20:# Download and build pkg-config
---
29:# Download and build ncurses
---
38:# Download and build libevent
---
48:# Download and build utf8proc
---
56:# Download and build tmux
---

Wait, line 15's content is "# This is a script to build and install tmux on macOS without homebrew." So the line in the input is "15:# This is a script to build and install tmux on macOS without homebrew."

Yes, so the output should include that line as is.

Now, check if any other lines might have comments. For example, line 3 is empty, line 7 is empty, etc. But empty lines don't have comments, so they're excluded.

Another check: line 8 is "function download_and_check() {", which is a function definition, no comment.

So the lines listed above are the only ones with comments.

Wait, line 1 is a shebang. Some might argue that shebang isn't a comment, but in the context of shell scripts, the #! is a special case, but the line is still considered a comment. However, the problem states "all lines with comments", and the shebang line starts with #, so it's a comment line. The user's instruction says "not tangentially related", but shebang is a standard comment line in shell scripts, so it should be included.

Therefore, the output should include line 1.

Now, let's confirm the line numbers:

Line 1: 1:#!/bin/bash

Line 4: 4:# Save the path to ./download_check script

Line 15: 15:# This is a script to build and install tmux on macOS without homebrew.

Line 20: 20:# Download and build pkg-config

Line 29: 29:# Download and build ncurses

Line 38: 38:# Download and build libevent

Line 48: 48:# Download and build utf8proc

Line 56: 56:# Download and build tmux

Yes, these are all the lines starting with # followed by a space or other characters (except line 1, which is #!/bin/bash).

So the output should list these lines with their numbers, each followed by "---".
