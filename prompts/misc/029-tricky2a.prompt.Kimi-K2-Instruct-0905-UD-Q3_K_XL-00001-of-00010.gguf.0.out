Bob is right.  
“Water freezes at 0 °C” means that is the temperature at which liquid water and ice are in equilibrium under 1 atm of pressure. At –10 °C that equilibrium is shifted completely to the solid side, so any ordinary sample of water will already have turned to ice; in other words, at –10 °C water is frozen (it has “frozen,” just as Bob said).
