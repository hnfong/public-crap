Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to perform a semantic "grep" for country or region names in the provided input. They specified that I should output the line number and the country/region name, similar to using `grep -n -o`. The key points are to only trigger when the input obviously matches the query and not to include tangentially related mentions.

First, I need to go through each line of the input and check for any explicit mentions of country or region names. The query is straightforward: look for names like "Britain," "France," "Portugal," "Germany," "Silesia," "Holland," "England," "Hamburg," "Dantzic," "Riga," and "France" again. These are all countries or regions mentioned in the text.

Looking at line 4: "Take Britain, for example." Here, "Britain" is a country, so I should output line 4 with "Britain."

Line 6: "if Britain imports French goods..." "Britain" and "French" are both countries. So, I need to output both with their respective line numbers. Wait, but the user wants only the country/region names. So, for line 6, "Britain" and "France" are both valid. But the line is a single line, so I should output each mention separately with the same line number? Or just the line once with all matches? The example given is similar to `grep -n -o`, which outputs each match on a new line with the line number. So, for line 6, I should output "Britain" on one line and "France" on another, both with line number 6.

Line 8: "National biases and prejudices often influence decisions..." No country names here.

Line 10: "When the exchange rate between two countries is at par..." "countries" is too vague, not a specific name. So, skip.

Line 12: "It's time for countries to rethink..." Again, "countries" is not specific.

Line 15: "[Show original]" No country names.

Line 16: "Imagine if England's merchants often pay for goods from Hamburg, Dantzic, and Riga..." Here, "England," "Hamburg," "Dantzic," and "Riga" are all countries or regions. So, output each with line number 16.

Line 17: "the trade balance is in its favor. Imagine if England's merchants..." "England" is mentioned again, so output line 17 with "England."

Line 18: No country names.

Line 19: "In France, individuals pay a duty of 8%..." "France" is mentioned, so output line 19 with "France."

Now, compiling all these matches:

- Line 4: Britain
- Line 6: Britain, France
- Line 16: England, Hamburg, Dantzic, Riga
- Line 17: England
- Line 19: France

Wait, line 6 has "Britain" and "France." Should I output both? Yes, because they are both country names in the same line. Similarly, line 16 has multiple names.

But the user's example is like `grep -n -o`, which would output each occurrence separately. So, for line 6, two separate lines: one for Britain and one for France, both with line number 6.

Same for line 16: four separate lines with line number 16.

Now, I need to make sure that the output is in the correct format: each match on a new line with the line number and the country name, followed by "---" after each line.

Also, check if any other lines have country names. Line 4: Britain. Line 6: Britain and France. Line 16: England, Hamburg, Dantzic, Riga. Line 17: England. Line 19: France. That's all.

No other lines have country names. For example, line 14 is empty, line 15 is a header, etc.

So, the final output should list each country name with its line number, each on a separate line, followed by "---".
