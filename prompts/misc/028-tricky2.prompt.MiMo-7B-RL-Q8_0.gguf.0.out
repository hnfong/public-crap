Okay, let's see. Alice and Bob are talking about what happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius. Alice says that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, which I remember from school. But Bob says it freezes at -10 degrees. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up something. Let me think.

So, the standard freezing point of water is definitely 0 degrees Celsius, right? At that temperature, liquid water turns into ice. If you go below that, like -10 degrees, the water should already be frozen. Unless there are some other factors. Maybe Bob is referring to something else, like the triple point or supercooling? Wait, the triple point of water is at around -45.81 degrees Celsius and 611.657 pascals, where liquid and solid coexist. But that's different. Or maybe supercooling, where water remains liquid below 0 degrees under certain conditions. But that's not the normal freezing point.

Wait, maybe Bob is confused with the melting point? No, the melting point is also 0 degrees Celsius. So unless there's impurities or something, but even then, the freezing point would lower slightly, but not all the way to -10. Unless it's a different substance. Wait, maybe Bob is talking about the Fahrenheit scale? No, -10 degrees Fahrenheit is different, but the conversation is in Celsius. So maybe Bob is just wrong. Alice is correct that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, and Bob is mistaken. But why does Bob say he's still right? Maybe he's trying to argue about something else, like maybe the scale? Or maybe he's referring to the temperature at which it freezes under certain conditions. But under standard atmospheric pressure, 0 degrees Celsius is the correct answer. So Alice is right, Bob is wrong. But wait, maybe there's a trick here. Let me check again. Freezing point of water is 0°C. So at -10°C, water would be frozen. So if you cool water to -10°C, it would have already frozen at 0°C. So Bob's statement that it freezes at -10°C is incorrect. Therefore, Alice is correct, Bob is wrong. But maybe Bob is referring to the temperature at which it freezes when it's already supercooled? But supercooling is when the liquid remains in a metastable state below the freezing point. But under normal conditions, when you cool water to 0°C, it freezes immediately. If you have very pure water and it's not disturbed, maybe it can supercool to a lower temperature before freezing. But that's not the standard freezing point. So in most cases, the answer is 0°C. So Alice is correct. Therefore, the conclusion is Alice is right, Bob is wrong. But wait, maybe the question is about what happens at -10°C, not the freezing point. So if water is at -10°C, it's already frozen. So the answer would be that water freezes at 0°C, so at -10°C, it's ice. But Bob is saying that water freezes at -10°C, which is incorrect. So Alice is correct. Yeah, that makes sense. So the answer is Alice is right, Bob is wrong because water freezes at 0°C, not -10°C. At -10°C, it would already be frozen.

Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0°C under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10°C, the water would already be in its frozen state (ice). Bob’s claim that water freezes at -10°C is incorrect, as the freezing point is universally 0°C for pure water in normal conditions. Any deviation (e.g., supercooling) involves specific exceptions, not the standard freezing point. 

**Answer:** Alice is right. Water freezes at 0°C, so at -10°C, it would already be ice. Bob’s statement is incorrect. [end of text]
