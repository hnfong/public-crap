### Probable Output

The command will output a list of the **20 most frequently occurring words** in your fan fiction file (`wowfanfic.txt`), sorted from least frequent to most frequent among that top 20.

The output will look something like this (hypothetical data based on typical WoW fiction):

```text
     15 Zul'jin
     18 Thrall
     22 Horde
     25 Alliance
     30 magic
     35 sword
     40 battle
     45 said
     50 looked
     55 like
     60 was
     65 The
     70 and
     75 to
     80 of
     85 a
     90 in
     95 that
    120 the
    150 
```
*(Note: The last line might be empty or contain punctuation depending on how the split handles trailing characters, but usually, it captures high-frequency function words.)*

### Step-by-Step Command Breakdown

To understand why this is the output, let's trace the data pipeline:

1.  `cat wowfanfic.txt`: Dumps the raw text of your story.
2.  `perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'`:
    *   Reads the file line by line.
    *   `split(/\s/)`: Breaks each line into an array of strings wherever there is whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines).
    *   `foreach`: Iterates through every word.
    *   `print $_ . "\n"`: Prints each word on its own separate line.
    *   *Result:* A long vertical list where every single word from your story is on a new line.
3.  `sort`: Sorts this long list alphabetically. This groups identical words together (e.g., all instances of "Arthas" appear consecutively).
4.  `uniq -c`: Collapses consecutive identical lines into a single line and prepends a count of how many times it appeared.
    *   *Result:* `15 Arthas`, `120 the`, etc.
5.  `sort -n`: Sorts these lines numerically based on the count (ascending order).
6.  `tail -n 20`: Takes the last 20 lines of this sorted list. Since the list is sorted from lowest count to highest, the "last 20" are the **20 words with the highest counts**.

### Explanation Based on Basic Linguistic Principles

The output you see is a direct demonstration of **Zipf's Law** and the distinction between **Content Words** and **Function Words**.

#### 1. Zipf's Law
This linguistic principle states that in any corpus of natural language, the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table.
*   The most frequent word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most frequent word, three times as often as the third, and so on.
*   **In your output:** You will see a steep curve. The #1 word (likely "the", "a", or "and") will have a count significantly higher than the #20 word. This mathematical distribution holds true for almost all human language, including fan fiction about Orcs and Humans.

#### 2. Function Words vs. Content Words
The output will almost certainly be dominated by **Function Words** (also called closed-class words) rather than **Content Words** (open-class words).

*   **Function Words:** These are grammatical glue words (e.g., *the, of, and, to, a, in, that, is*). They carry little semantic meaning on their own but are required for sentence structure. Because every sentence needs them, they appear with extremely high frequency.
    *   *Likely Result:* The top 5–10 items in your list will be these generic English words, not WoW-specific terms.
*   **Content Words:** These are nouns, verbs, and adjectives that carry specific meaning (e.g., *Thrall, Jaina, sword, magic, battle, shadow*).
    *   *Likely Result:* These will appear lower down in the top 20 list (perhaps ranks 11–20) unless your writing style is very repetitive or uses a highly specialized vocabulary that overrides standard grammar patterns.

#### 3. Tokenization Limitations (The "Noise" Factor)
The specific Perl command used (`split(/\s/)`) is a naive tokenizer. It splits only on whitespace.
*   **Punctuation Attachment:** It does not strip punctuation. Therefore, "sword" and "sword," or "The" and "The." are treated as **different words** by the `sort | uniq` pipeline.
*   **Linguistic Impact:** This violates the principle of **lemmatization** (grouping different forms of a word). Consequently, your frequency count for specific content words will be artificially lowered because the counts are split between the clean word and the punctuation-attached version.
    *   *Example:* If you wrote "Arthas" 50 times and "Arthas," 50 times, the output might show two entries of 50, preventing "Arthas" from reaching the top 20, whereas "the" (which rarely takes punctuation directly without a space following) will dominate the list.

### Summary
The command generates a **unigram frequency list** of your text. Due to **Zipf's Law**, the top of this list will be dominated by high-frequency **function words** essential to English grammar, while your specific **World of Warcraft content words** will likely appear near the bottom of the top 20 or be excluded entirely due to the lack of punctuation handling in the script.
