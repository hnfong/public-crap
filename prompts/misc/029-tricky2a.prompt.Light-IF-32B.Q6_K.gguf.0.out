Both Alice and Bob are **partially right**, but **Alice is more accurate** in a standard scientific context.

- **Alice is right** that **pure water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius** under standard atmospheric pressure.
- **Bob is also right** in a **practical or colloquial sense**, because **water can sometimes remain liquid below 0°C** (this is called supercooling), and **at -10°C, water will definitely freeze** unless it's in a very controlled, supercooled state (which is rare in everyday situations).

So, **Bob is simplifying**, and **Alice is giving the standard freezing point**. In most cases, **Bob's statement is acceptable**, but **Alice's is scientifically precise**. [end of text]
