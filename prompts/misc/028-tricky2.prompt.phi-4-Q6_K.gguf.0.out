Bob is correct in the context of his statement. While it is true that water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure, water can indeed freeze at -10 degrees Celsius. This is because freezing is a process that can occur at any temperature below the freezing point, given enough time or the right conditions (such as the presence of impurities or changes in pressure). Therefore, at -10 degrees Celsius, water will freeze, making Bob's statement accurate. [end of text]
