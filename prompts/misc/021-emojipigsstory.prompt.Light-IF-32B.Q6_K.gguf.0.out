Let's break down the story in emojis to make sure it's clear:

1. **🐷🐷🐷🏠💨** - Three little pigs with a house and wind (setting up the start)
2. **🐷🐷🏠🔥** - Two pigs with a house made of straw/wood (which catches fire easily)
3. **🐷🏠🧱🛡️** - One pig with a brick house (strong and safe)
4. **🐺💨🐷🐷🐷** - The wolf comes with wind, targeting the pigs
5. **🐷🐷🔥😱** - The two pigs' house burns, they're scared
6. **🐷🧱🛡️💪** - The strong pig stands guard with bricks, being brave
7. **🐺🔥🧱💥** - The wolf tries to burn the brick house, but it's strong
8. **🐷🛡️🐻🐻🐻** - The brave pig protects the other pigs, maybe with help from friends (bears)
9. **🐷🐷🐷🎉🏡🐻** - All pigs are safe, celebrating at home with friends

This is a creative, emoji-only version of the Three Little Pigs story! [end of text]
