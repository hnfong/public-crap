The user wants me to name a place in World of Warcraft lore for every letter of the alphabet, but with specific constraints:
1. Original vanilla WoW only (no expansions)
2. Starting with "A for Azeroth"

I need to be careful here. "Vanilla WoW" means the original game as it was at launch (version 1.0 through 1.12.x), before any expansions. This includes:
- The original continents: Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor
- The original level 60 content
- The original dungeons and raids
- The original zones

I should NOT include:
- Outland (Burning Crusade)
- Northrend (Wrath of the Lich King)
- Pandaria (Mists of Pandaria)
- etc.

Also, I need to distinguish between "places in WoW lore" and "places that existed as zones/areas in vanilla WoW." The user says "place in World of Warcraft lore" but also specifies "Original vanilla WoW only." This is a bit ambiguous. I think they mean places that existed in the vanilla game world, not just lore locations that were mentioned but not in-game. So I should focus on actual zones, major cities, dungeons, and significant landmarks that were physically present in vanilla WoW.

Let me list the alphabet and think of vanilla WoW places for each letter:

A - Azeroth (the world itself, or the continent - but Azeroth is the world, and the continent is called Eastern Kingdoms. "Azeroth" is also a zone in the Eastern Kingdoms - the subzone around Stormwind. This works perfectly as the starting point)

B - Barrens (major zone in Kalimdor)
C - Crossroads (major settlement in Barrens) or Darnassus? No, Darnassus is a city. Or "Burning Steppes"? Let me think... "Blackrock Mountain" is a major location. "Blackfathom Deeps" is a dungeon. "Booty Bay" is a major settlement. I'll go with Barrens for B to keep it simple as a zone.
D - Darnassus (Night Elf capital) or Darkshore (zone) or Deadmines (dungeon) or Desolace (zone) or Durotar (zone) or Dun Morogh (zone) or Duskwood (zone) or Dustwallow Marsh (zone). Many options. I'll pick Darnassus.
E - Elwynn Forest (zone) or Eastern Plaguelands (zone) or Eastern Kingdoms (continent). Eastern Plaguelands works.
F - Feralas (zone) or Felwood (zone). Feralas is good.
G - Gadgetzan (city in Tanaris) or Gnomeregan (dungeon/capital). Gnomeregan works.
H - Hillsbrad Foothills (zone) or Hyjal (though not accessible in vanilla, it existed in lore and was visible). Hillsbrad Foothills is definitely vanilla.
I - Ironforge (dwarven capital) or Stranglethorn Vale? No, that's S. Or "The Hinterlands"? That's H. "Icecrown"? No, that's Wrath. "Isle of"? There are no islands in vanilla. "Inferno"? No. Let me think... "In" places... "The Barrens"? No. Actually, "The Hinterlands" is H. For I, I could use "Ironforge" (city) or maybe "The Great Sea"? No. "Illidan"? That's a character. For I, Ironforge is perfect.
J - "J" is tough. "Jintha'Alor"? That's in The Hinterlands, a major troll city. That works!
K - "Kalimdor" (continent) or "Karazhan"? Karazhan was added in Burning Crusade (though the tower existed, it wasn't a dungeon/raid until BC). So Kalimdor is the best bet.
L - Loch Modan (zone) or "Lordaeron"? Lordaeron is the continent/subcontinent. Loch Modan is a specific zone.
M - Mulgore (zone) or "Molten Core" (raid) or "Maraudon" (dungeon) or "Moonglade" (zone). Many options. Mulgore is good.
N - "N" is tricky. "Naxxramas"? That was added in patch 1.11, so it IS vanilla! It's a raid. "Northern Barrens"? No, just Barrens. "Northshire"? That's a subzone in Elwynn. "Nijel's Point"? That's in Desolace. "Nether"? No, that's BC. I think Naxxramas is the best choice since it's a major raid added during vanilla.
O - Orgrimmar (capital city) - perfect.
P - "Plaguelands" (Eastern Plaguelands) or "Pandaria"? No, that's expansion. "Purgation"? No. "Pyrewood"? That's a village in Silverpine. I'll go with "Plaguelands" but specify Eastern Plaguelands.
Q - "Q" is very hard. "Quel'Thalas"? The zone existed but was inaccessible in vanilla (just a gate). But it was in the lore and physically present as a border. I think this is acceptable. "Q" is always difficult.
R - Redridge Mountains (zone) or Razorfen Downs (dungeon) or Razorfen Kraul (dungeon). Redridge Mountains is a good clear choice.
S - Stranglethorn Vale (zone) or Silithus (zone) or Stonetalon Mountains (zone) or Stormwind City (capital) or Silverpine Forest (zone). Many options. Stranglethorn Vale is iconic.
T - Tanaris (zone) or Teldrassil (zone/capital area) or Thousand Needles (zone) or Tirisfal Glades (zone) or Temple of Atal'Hakkar (dungeon). Teldrassil is great.
U - "U" is tough. "Uldaman" (dungeon) or "Un'Goro Crater" (zone). Un'Goro Crater is perfect.
V - "V" is also tough. "Valley of Trials"? That's in Durotar. "Vashj'ir"? No, that's Cataclysm. "Vault of"? Not in vanilla. "V" is difficult. "The Veiled Sea"? That's the ocean. "Valgarde"? That's Wrath. Let me think... "V" places in vanilla... "Valley of the Watchers"? That's in Tanaris. "V" is really hard. I could use "Valley of Trials" (starting area) or "Violet Citadel"? No, that's Wrath. "V" might be the hardest letter. Actually, "V" could be "Valley of Heroes" in Stormwind, but that's a subzone. I'll think of something... "V" - maybe "Vile Reef"? That's in Stranglethorn. But I want major places. Let me reconsider... "V" - "Valley of Trials" (Durotar starting area) is probably the best I can do. Or "Vortex Pinnacle"? No, that's Cataclysm. "V" is really problematic. Wait, what about "The Veiled Sea"? It's a zone on the map. Or I could use "V" for "Valley" as in "Valley of the Watchers" but that's too obscure. Let me check my vanilla WoW knowledge... There's really no good "V" zone. I'll have to use a subzone or be creative. "V" could be "Violet Hold"? No, that's Wrath. "V" for "Valley of Trials" it is.
W - Westfall (zone) or Winterspring (zone) or Wailing Caverns (dungeon). Westfall is iconic.
X - "X" is impossible. "X" - maybe "Xroads"? But that's just short for Crossroads. There are no "X" places. I'll have to be creative or admit defeat. "X" - "Xavian"? That's in Ashenvale. It's a satyr area. It's obscure but it's there. Or I could say "No X locations in vanilla WoW" but that's not fun. Let me check... "X" - "Xavian" is a place in Ashenvale, a satyr ruin. It's not a major zone but it's a named location. I'll use it.
Y - "Y" - "Ysera's domain"? No, that's Emerald Dream. "Yojamba Isle"? That's in Stranglethorn! It's a small island with Zandalar trolls. That works!
Z - "Z" - "Zul'Farrak" (dungeon) or "Zul'Gurub" (raid) or "Zoram'gar Outpost"? That's in Ashenvale. Zul'Farrak is perfect.

Let me refine my list to be more consistent - I should probably stick to zones, major cities, or major dungeons/raids where possible.

A - Azeroth (the world, or the southern continent)
B - Barrens (zone)
C - Crossroads (major settlement) or "Caverns of Time"? No, that's BC. "Camp Taurajo"? That's in Barrens. I'll use Crossroads as it's iconic.
D - Darnassus (capital city)
E - Eastern Plaguel
