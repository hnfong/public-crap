Here are the answers to your questions:

A) No, water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) at standard atmospheric pressure.

B) If you cool down a glass of pure water to -12 degrees Celsius, it will still be a liquid. It will not freeze at this temperature. It will continue to cool down and eventually reach its freezing point of 0 degrees Celsius, at which point it will start to freeze. [end of text]
