If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

A theory that proves itself is generally referred to as "self-referentially consistent" or "non-contradictory," rather than tautological. A tautology is a statement that is always true, regardless of the values of its variables. 

For example, the statement "It is raining, or it is not raining" is a tautology because it is always true, no matter the actual weather. 

A theory proving itself, on the other hand, means that the theory does not lead to contradictions within its own framework. This is a desirable property for a theory, as contradictions would imply that the theory is inconsistent and therefore unreliable.

One example of a self-referential consistency proof is GÃ¶del's second incompleteness theorem, which states that any sufficiently strong, consistent formal system cannot prove its own consistency. However, this doesn't mean that the system actually is consistent; it just means that the system cannot prove its own consistency within its own axioms.

It's important to note that a theory proving itself doesn't necessarily mean it's true or complete. It just means that it doesn't contain internal contradictions.
