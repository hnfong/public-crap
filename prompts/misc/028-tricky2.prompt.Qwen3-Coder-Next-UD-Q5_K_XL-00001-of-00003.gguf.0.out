Alice is right.

Water freezes at **0°C** under standard atmospheric pressure. Bob is incorrect to say “water freezes at -10°C” as a general statement — while *supercooled* water can remain liquid below 0°C (even down to ~-40°C under very pure, still conditions), it is not *stable* at -10°C and will freeze upon disturbance. The standard freezing point of water is **0°C**, not -10°C.

Bob’s claim is misleading — saying “I’m still right” doesn’t make it true. [end of text]
