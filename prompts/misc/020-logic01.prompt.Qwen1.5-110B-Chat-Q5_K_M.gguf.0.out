If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

If a theory proves itself, it depends on the context whether we would call it "consistent," "tautological," or use another term altogether. The concepts you've mentioned are related but refer to different aspects of a theory.

1. **Consistent**: A theory is consistent if it is not possible to derive a contradiction within it. That is, you cannot prove both a statement and its negation. Consistency is a fundamental property that a reasonable theory should have to avoid being trivial.

2. **Tautological** or **Logically True**: In the context of logic, a tautology is a statement that is true under every possible interpretation or valuation of its propositional variables. For instance, "A or not A" is a tautology in classical logic because it's true regardless of whether A is true or false. When referring to a theory, if it's a collection of axioms that are essentially tautologies (true by virtue of their logical form), it might be seen as expressing a set of self-evident truths but this usage is less common and might not apply directly to how we normally discuss theories.

3. **Self-Referential or Self-Verifying**: If a theory proves itself, this has more to do with self-reference, and it could lead to issues like Russell's paradox or self-referential statements. However, this property doesn't directly classify the theory as consistent or tautological without further examination.

**Examples:**

- **Russell's Paradox**: This isn't exactly an example of a theory proving itself, but it illustrates the danger of self-reference in set theory. Russell's paradox arises when considering a set that contains all sets which do not contain themselves. The question of whether this set contains itself leads to a contradiction.

- **Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems**: Gödel's first incompleteness theorem shows that in any sufficiently powerful formal system, there are statements that cannot be proven true or false within the system. However, he also showed how to construct a statement within a theory that essentially says, "I cannot be proven in this theory," and if the theory is consistent, it cannot prove this statement (nor its negation), demonstrating a more nuanced relationship between provability and consistency.

- **A Theory of Everything (T.O.E.)**: In physics, a hypothetical theory that explains and connects all fundamental physical forces might be seen as a theory that "explains itself" in a sense, but this doesn't make it tautological. The consistency of such a theory would be of great concern to physicists.

In summary, a theory proving itself doesn't straightforwardly make it either consistent or tautological without further clarification. Consistency is about avoiding contradictions, while tautology refers to statements that are universally true by their logical form. A theory that proves itself without contradiction could be seen as consistent, but the act of self-proof is more indicative of self-reference and requires careful analysis to avoid logical pitfalls.
