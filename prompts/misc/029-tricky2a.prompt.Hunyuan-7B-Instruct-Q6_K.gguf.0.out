Alice is right. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10 degrees Celsius, water is indeed in its solid state, but this is because it has already frozen at 0 degrees Celsius and continued to cool, causing it to solidify further.

Bob's response, "Yes, but I'm still right," is a bit misleading because it implies that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius, which is not true. While water does freeze at -10 degrees Celsius, it freezes at 0 degrees Celsius first. Bob's statement could be interpreted as suggesting that freezing occurs at -10 degrees Celsius, which would be incorrect.
