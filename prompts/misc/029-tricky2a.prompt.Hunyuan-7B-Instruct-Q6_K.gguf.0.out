Alice is right. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10 degrees Celsius, water is indeed frozen, as it has passed the freezing point. Bob's statement, "Yes, but I'm still right," is misleading because it doesn't clarify the conditions under which water freezes. While water can freeze at temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius, it requires the presence of sufficient ice nuclei (like impurities or dust) to initiate freezing. Without these, water may remain in a supercooled liquid state at -10 degrees Celsius.
