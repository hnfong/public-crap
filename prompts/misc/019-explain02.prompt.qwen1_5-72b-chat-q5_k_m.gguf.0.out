Explain the role of China's National People Congress to a 5 year old child who lives in London.

Okay, imagine that in China, there is a big group of people who are kind of like a team. This team is called the National People's Congress, or NPC for short. They are important because they help make rules for the country, kind of like how teachers make rules for a classroom.

In London, you have the Queen and Parliament, right? In China, instead, the NPC is like a giant meeting where these team members talk about how to make life better for everyone living there. They discuss things like schools, hospitals, and keeping people safe. Then, they vote on new ideas to turn them into laws.

So, just like how you might suggest a new game to play with your friends, the NPC members suggest ideas to help China grow and be a happy place for all. And everyone in the team listens and decides together if it's a good idea or not. That's what the National People's Congress does!
