Let me break down what this command does step by step:

1. `cat wowfanfic.txt` - reads the fan fiction file
2. `perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'` - splits each line on whitespace and prints each word on its own line
3. `sort` - sorts all the words alphabetically
4. `uniq -c` - counts consecutive identical words and prefixes each line with the count
5. `sort -n` - sorts numerically by the count (ascending)
6. `tail -n 20` - shows the last 20 lines (i.e., the 20 most frequent words)

**Probable output:**
The command will display the 20 most frequent words in your fan fiction, sorted by frequency (most frequent at the bottom). Each line will show a count followed by the word.

**Example format:**
```
     15 and
     23 the
     34 of
     42 to
     56 in
    123 Arthas
    145 Thrall
    178 Jaina
    234 Alliance
    345 Horde
    ...
   1234 WoW
```

**Linguistic principles involved:**
- **Zipf's Law**: In natural language texts, word frequency follows a power-law distribution where a few words (like function words: "the", "of", "and") appear very frequently, while most words appear rarely
- **Content vs. function words**: You'll likely see high-frequency function words at the top of the list, but since you're taking the *tail* (most frequent), you might see character names, proper nouns, or key thematic words from your fan fiction that appear most often
- **Tokenization**: The command treats whitespace as word boundaries, which is a basic text segmentation approach

The exact output depends on your fan fiction's content, but it will reveal the most frequently used words, likely including character names, pronouns, and common fantasy vocabulary. [end of text]
