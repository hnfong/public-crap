ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

The lyrics begin by describing a small restaurant in the forest that is so hidden and remote that even following a trail of breadcrumbs won't lead you there. It seems to be a place that people stumble upon when they've lost their way or forgotten their path. Despite its obscurity, the restaurant is not busy; there are no reservations, and during lunchtime, the place is filled with empty seats. The atmosphere is whimsical, with birds laughing as if they're in on a secret joke.

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

The restaurant has a bright red roof and a simple menu with only the chef's recommendations. From the kitchen, you can hear classical music being played on instruments like the violin, flute, cello, and viola, adding to the enchanting ambiance of the place.

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

The lyrics welcome guests warmly, suggesting that after eating the "tarafuku" (a play on words that could mean "cod roe" but in this context seems to be a fictional dish), they might fall asleep, hinting at the magical or enchanting nature of the food. The song playfully bids farewell to the guests, saying "tomorrow is tomorrow," as if to say life will go on, and there's always more to come.

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

The song describes a scene where everyone, including a little bear riding on someone's hand, starts to dance from right to left. The lyrics mention various dishes like Carpaccio, Paella, and Oeufs en Meurette (an egg dish cooked in red wine), but there is no risotto or dessert. It suggests that the meal will be so satisfying that even the graves will partake, implying that the experience is to die for. The song concludes by declaring that tonight's meal is the final full course, emphasizing the special and perhaps once-in-a-lifetime nature of the dining experience at this magical forest restaurant.

In summary, the lyrics tell the story of a hidden, whimsical restaurant in the forest that offers an extraordinary dining experience. The place is so secret that it's found by those who are lost or have forgotten their way. The restaurant serves simple but recommended dishes, accompanied by the beautiful sounds of classical music. The food is so good that it's likened to putting one to sleep, and the experience is so profound that it's as if it reaches even the graves. The song captures the essence of a magical, otherworldly feast that is both delightful and mysterious. [end of text]
