If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

Yes, the theory of the universe is often considered consistent, meaning that it is consistent with itself and its own internal consistency. This is because the universe is governed by a set of fundamental laws that govern the behavior of matter and energy, and these laws are self-consistent.

For example, the laws of physics, such as the laws of motion and the laws of thermodynamics, are self-consistent because they are based on the principles of the physical world. The laws of physics are not arbitrary or arbitrary, but rather they are the natural laws that govern the behavior of the universe.

Similarly, the laws of logic, such as the laws of mathematics and the laws of formal systems, are also self-consistent because they are based on the principles of the physical world. The laws of logic are not arbitrary or arbitrary, but rather they are the natural laws that govern the behavior of the universe.

In other words, the universe is consistent because it is governed by a set of fundamental laws that are self-consistent, and these laws are the natural laws that govern the behavior of the universe. This is why the laws of physics, the laws of mathematics, and the laws of formal systems are considered consistent.

It's worth noting that this is not a strict definition, but rather a heuristic principle. The laws of physics, the laws of mathematics, and the laws of formal systems are considered consistent because they are based on the principles of the physical world, and these principles are self-consistent. However, it's also possible to have a theory that is not consistent, but still has a natural explanation for its own internal consistency.

In the case of the universe, the laws of physics, the laws of mathematics, and the laws of formal systems are considered consistent because they are based on the principles of the physical world, and these principles are self-consistent. [end of text]
