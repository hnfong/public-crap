If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?
When a theory or framework proves itself, it is typically referred to as "self-referential" or "self-fulfilling." The term "consistent" is generally used to describe a theory or system that does not contain contradictions, meaning that it does not prove both a statement and its negation. The term "tautological" refers to a statement that is always true, regardless of the truth values of its components, such as "Either it is raining or it is not raining."

### Self-Referential Theories

1. **Self-Referential Axioms**:
   - **Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems**: One of the most famous examples of self-referential theories is Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems. These theorems show that in any sufficiently powerful, consistent formal system, there are statements that cannot be proven or disproven within that system. This self-referential nature is inherent in the structure of the system itself.

2. **Self-Fulfilling Prophecies**:
   - **Social Theories**: In social sciences, theories that predict certain outcomes can sometimes create those outcomes through the actions of people who believe in the theory. For example, if a theory predicts that a certain group of people will behave in a certain way, and people act according to this prediction, the theory becomes self-fulfilling.

3. **Logical Frameworks**:
   - **Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory (ZFC)**: This is a foundational theory in mathematics. It includes the axiom of regularity, which prevents self-referential sets (sets that contain themselves). However, the theory itself is not self-referential in the sense that it proves itself, but it does provide a framework within which self-referential paradoxes are avoided.

### Tautological Statements

1. **Logical Statements**:
   - **"Either it is raining or it is not raining."**: This statement is a tautology because it is always true, regardless of whether it is raining or not.

2. **Mathematical Statements**:
   - **"A ∨ ¬A"**: In propositional logic, this statement is a tautology because it is true regardless of the truth value of A.

### Examples of Theories That Are Consistent but Not Tautological

1. **Peano Arithmetic**:
   - This is a theory of arithmetic that includes axioms for the natural numbers. It is consistent because it does not contain contradictions, but it is not tautological because it does not always produce true statements regardless of the input.

2. **Euclidean Geometry**:
   - This is a geometric theory based on a set of axioms. It is consistent because it does not contain contradictions, but it is not tautological because it depends on the specific axioms and definitions used.

### Summary

- **Self-referential theories** are those that involve statements or systems that refer to themselves, often leading to paradoxes or incompleteness.
- **Consistent theories** are those that do not contain contradictions.
- **Tautological statements** are always true regardless of the truth values of their components.

In summary, a theory that proves itself is often self-referential, but whether it is consistent or tautological depends on the specific nature of the theory and its statements. [end of text]
