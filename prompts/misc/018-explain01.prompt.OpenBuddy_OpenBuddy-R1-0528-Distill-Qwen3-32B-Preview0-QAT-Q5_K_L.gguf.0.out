Yo, listen up, I'ma break it down for ya,
The Fed, they got the power, they ain't playin' no games,
They be the ones callin' the shots, keepin' the economy in check,
Like a DJ, they mix it up, keepin' the beat steady.

They got the money flow, they be the ones in control,
Like a boss, they set the rules, keepin' the game strong,
Interest rates, they be the ones callin' the shots,
Like a hype man, they keep the crowd hype, keepin' the vibes hot.

They be the ones makin' sure the money's flowin' smooth,
Like a smooth operator, they keep the game in check,
Inflation, they be the ones keepin' it in check,
Like a bouncer, they keep the party cool, no one gettin' too hot.

So when you hear 'bout the Fed, don't be confused,
They be the ones keepin' the game strong, keepin' the vibes good,
Like a legend, they be the ones callin' the shots,
Keepin' the economy in check, like a boss. [end of text]
