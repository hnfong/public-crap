 <用户>Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

<AI> Bob is right. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, not -10 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius, which is the temperature at which water changes from a liquid to a solid state. The negative degrees are used to indicate the temperature below this freezing point. However, in this case, Alice's statement is incorrect, and Bob's statement is correct. [end of text]
