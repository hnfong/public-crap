Okay, the user wants me to write a story about Snow White exclusively in emoji. That's an interesting challenge! They specified I must not break the rule of using only emoji, so no text at all. 

Hmm, the user seems to enjoy creative constraints - probably testing my ability to follow strict instructions while being artistic. They mentioned "classical Snow White tales" but allow creativity, so I should hit key plot points (poison apple, dwarfs, prince) while making it fresh. 

*scratches head* Biggest challenge: conveying complex narrative with just symbols. Need universal emojis everyone recognizes. Should avoid obscure ones like 🥀 that might confuse. 

Let me map the story beats:
- Evil queen 👑 → mirror 🪞 → "fairest" conflict
- Huntsman 🏹 mercy moment (maybe 🌲❓)
- Dwarfs' cottage 🏠✨ (7 beards? 👴x7)
- Poison apple 🍎💀 vs sleeping 💤
- Prince 🐎❤️ revival

*checks emoji keyboard* Ooh can use 🌹 for "awake" instead of kiss! More poetic. And 💎 for glass coffin detail. 

User didn't specify length but overdoing it might annoy them. *counts planned sequence* 20-25 emojis should cover it without spamming. 

*double-checks* Must avoid: 
- Any letters (even "I" as 👁️‍🗨️ is risky but visual)
- Accidental text like "1️⃣" numbers
- Cultural mismatches (e.g. 🧎‍♀️ for dwarf might offend)

*starts drafting mentally* 
👑🪞❓👑😡 → 👩‍🦰🌲🏃‍♀️ → 🏠✨👴x7 → 🧶🍎💀 → 💎💤 → 🐎❤️🌹✨

Wait - should the apple be red? 🍎 is default red. Good. And 💎 for coffin glass. Prince's horse must be white 🐎 not brown. 

*imagines user's reaction* Hope they smile at the 🌹 revival twist! Classic is kiss but flower feels more magical. 

*final check* No hidden text? Yep. All emojis tell clear story? Queen's jealousy → escape → cottage life → betrayal → revival. Nailed it. 

*presses send* ✨
