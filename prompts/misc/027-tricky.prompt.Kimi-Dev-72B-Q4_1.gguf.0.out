A) Water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius. However, under certain conditions, such as the presence of impurities or nucleation sites, water can be supercooled below 0°C. At -12°C, pure water might still be liquid if it's supercooled, but it's not common. So, the answer is no, water does not freeze at -12°C under normal conditions.

B) If you have a glass of pure water and cool it down to -12°C, the water might remain liquid if it's supercooled. However, once it reaches that temperature, any disturbance or introduction of a nucleation site (like a speck of dust) could cause it to freeze rapidly. But in a controlled environment without such disturbances, the water could stay liquid even at -12°C. However, this is not typical, and usually, water would freeze before reaching that temperature. So, the most likely outcome is that the water would freeze, but if it's pure and supercooled, it might remain liquid until a nucleation event occurs.
