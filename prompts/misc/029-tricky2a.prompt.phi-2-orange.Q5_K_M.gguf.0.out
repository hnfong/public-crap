Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). At -10 degrees Celsius, water is indeed in a solid state, which is ice. Alice's statement is also correct, but she provided the freezing point of water, not the temperature at which it freezes. Both statements are true, but Bob's statement is more relevant to the question asked.

It's important to note that the freezing point of water is a specific temperature at which water changes from a liquid to a solid state under standard atmospheric pressure. The freezing point of water is a well-known fact and is widely accepted in scientific and educational contexts.

In summary, both Alice and Bob are correct, but Bob's statement is more relevant to the question asked. The freezing point of water is indeed 0 degrees Celsius.

It's also worth mentioning that the freezing point of water can vary slightly depending on the pressure and impurities present in the water. However, for most practical purposes, the freezing point of water at 0 degrees Celsius is a reliable reference point.

In the context of the conversation, Bob's statement about water freezing at -10 degrees Celsius is incorrect, but his statement about water freezing at 0 degrees Celsius is correct. Alice's statement about the freezing point of water is also correct. Both Bob and Alice are correct, but Bob's statement is more relevant to the question asked.

It's essential to understand the difference between the freezing point of water and the temperature at which water freezes. The freezing point of water is a specific temperature at which water changes from a liquid to a solid state under standard atmospheric pressure, while the temperature at which water freezes is the same as its freezing point. In this case, the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius.

It's also worth noting that the freezing point of water is a well-known fact and is widely accepted in scientific and educational contexts. The freezing point of water is a specific temperature at which water changes from a liquid to a solid state under standard atmospheric pressure.
