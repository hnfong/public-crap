In this Magic: The Gathering scenario, Alice and Bob are engaged in a strategic battle where Alice aims to eliminate Bob's Orim, Samite Healer, a key defensive creature. Let's break down the optimal plays for both players, considering the game mechanics and the cards in play.

### Initial Setup:
- **Alice's Hand**: Two copies of 'Kindle' (an instant that deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards).
- **Bob's Board**: Orim, Samite Healer (a 1/3 creature with the ability to tap and prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn).
- **Mana Situation**: Alice has sufficient mana to cast any spells, and Bob's lands are tapped out, meaning he cannot cast any spells or activate abilities that require mana this turn.

### Alice's Optimal Play:
Alice's goal is to kill Orim, Samite Healer. She has two copies of Kindle in her hand, and the damage dealt by Kindle increases based on the number of Kindle cards in the graveyard.

1. **Cast the First Kindle**:
   - Alice casts the first Kindle targeting Orim.
   - Since there are no Kindle cards in the graveyard yet, X = 2.
   - Kindle deals 2 damage to Orim. Orim's toughness is 3, so it survives with 1 toughness remaining.

2. **Bob's Response**:
   - Bob has the opportunity to respond to Alice's spell. He can tap Orim to prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.
   - However, since Kindle only deals 2 damage, and Orim can prevent up to 3 damage, tapping Orim in response to the first Kindle would be suboptimal for Bob. Preventing 2 damage when he could prevent up to 3 is not the best use of Orim's ability.
   - Therefore, Bob likely chooses not to tap Orim in response to the first Kindle, allowing Orim to take the 2 damage and survive with 1 toughness.

3. **Cast the Second Kindle**:
   - After the first Kindle resolves, Alice casts the second Kindle, also targeting Orim.
   - Now, there is one Kindle card in the graveyard, so X = 2 + 1 = 3.
   - Kindle deals 3 damage to Orim. Orim, having only 1 toughness remaining, is destroyed.

### Bob's Optimal Play:
Bob's goal is to keep Orim alive to continue preventing damage. Given the sequence of events, Bob's best play is to recognize that tapping Orim in response to the first Kindle would not prevent Orim's destruction, as Alice can simply cast the second Kindle to deal the lethal damage.

- **Do Not Tap Orim in Response to the First Kindle**:
  - By not tapping Orim, Bob allows Orim to take the 2 damage from the first Kindle, surviving with 1 toughness.
  - This sets up the situation where the second Kindle, dealing 3 damage, will destroy Orim. However, there is no better play for Bob in this scenario, as tapping Orim earlier would not change the outcome.

### Outcome:
- Alice casts the first Kindle, dealing 2 damage to Orim. Orim survives with 1 toughness.
- Bob does not tap Orim in response, as it would not prevent Orim's destruction.
- Alice casts the second Kindle, dealing 3 damage to Orim. Orim is destroyed.

### Thought Process Summary:
- **Alice**: Recognizes that casting both Kindles in sequence will deal enough damage to kill Orim, taking advantage of the increasing damage based on the number of Kindle cards in the graveyard.
- **Bob**: Understands that tapping Orim in response to the first Kindle would not prevent Orim's destruction and chooses to conserve Orim's ability for a more impactful moment, which, in this case, does not exist.

In conclusion, the optimal play for Alice is to cast both Kindles in sequence, and for Bob, the optimal play is to recognize that Orim cannot be saved and to not waste Orim's ability on the first Kindle. The outcome is that Orim is destroyed by the second Kindle. [end of text]
