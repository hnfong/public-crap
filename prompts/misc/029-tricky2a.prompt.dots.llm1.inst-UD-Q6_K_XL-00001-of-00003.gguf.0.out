Both Alice and Bob are correct, but they are referring to slightly different scenarios. 

- **Alice** is correct that the freezing point of water is **0°C** under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm). At this temperature, water transitions from liquid to solid (ice). 

- **Bob** is also correct because if water is already at **-10°C**, it will **remain frozen** (as ice) because this temperature is below its freezing point. In other words, water cannot exist as a liquid at -10°C at 1 atm pressure; it will be in the solid state.

### Key Point:
- **Freezing Point**: 0°C (where liquid water turns to ice).  
- **State at -10°C**: Ice (since -10°C is below the freezing point).  

So, Bob’s statement "It freezes" could imply that if you cool water to -10°C, it will **stay frozen**, which is true. However, the freezing process itself occurs at 0°C. Alice is more precise about the freezing point, while Bob is correct about the state of water at -10°C. 

**Final Answer:** Both are correct, but Alice is precise about the freezing point (0°C), while Bob correctly states that water remains frozen (-10°C). [end of text]
