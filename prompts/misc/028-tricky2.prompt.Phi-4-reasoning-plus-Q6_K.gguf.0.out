We have a conversation between Alice and Bob. The conversation is:

Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

We need to determine who is right and explain briefly.

Let's analyze: Water freezing point is 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. But Bob says water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius. But then Bob says "Yes, but I'm still right." Possibly Bob is referring to the fact that water can freeze at -10 degrees Celsius if conditions are right, e.g. supercooling or if water is not pure, or if there is a nucleation site. But wait, let's check: Under standard conditions, water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius. But water can freeze below 0 degrees Celsius if it is supercooled. But then Bob's statement "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius" is not correct under standard conditions. But Bob's statement "Yes, but I'm still right" might be a pun or a trick. Let's check: Possibly Bob is referring to the fact that water can freeze at -10 degrees Celsius if it is supercooled. But then Alice says "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius." But then Bob says "Yes, but I'm still right." Possibly Bob is referring to the fact that water can freeze at -10 degrees Celsius if it is supercooled. But then the conversation is ambiguous.

Wait, let's re-read the conversation carefully:

Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."
