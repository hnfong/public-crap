### A) Does water freeze at -12°C?
**Yes, water can freeze at -12°C, but it depends on conditions.**  
- **Pure water** (without impurities) can remain liquid below 0°C due to **supercooling**. It may not freeze until it reaches around -38°C, where homogeneous nucleation occurs.  
- **Impurities or disturbances** (e.g., dust, container walls) act as nucleation sites, causing freezing at temperatures slightly below 0°C (e.g., -5°C to -10°C).  
- **At -12°C**, water is likely to freeze if impurities or agitation are present, but it could still be liquid if perfectly pure and undisturbed.

### B) What happens if pure water is cooled to -12°C?
**It may remain liquid (supercooled) or freeze, depending on purity and disturbances.**  
- **If perfectly pure and undisturbed**: Water can stay liquid as a **supercooled liquid** down to about -38°C.  
- **If impurities or agitation are present**: Ice crystals form, and the water freezes.  
- **Result**: At -12°C, pure water is **metastable**—it’s thermodynamically favorable to freeze, but kinetic barriers may prevent it. A small disturbance (e.g., shaking) can trigger rapid freezing. [end of text]
