Alright, buckle up, because this is going to be a deep dive into Vanilla WoW lore for every letter of the alphabet. No expansions allowed! Here we go:

**A for Azeroth:** The entire planet, the stage for all the conflict. The world itself.

**B for Blackrock Depths:** A massive, sprawling complex beneath Blackrock Mountain, once a stronghold of the Dark Iron dwarves and later overrun by orcs.

**C for Crossroads:** The central hub for the Horde in the Barrens, a dusty, lawless trading post.

**D for Duskwood:** A perpetually gloomy forest in Eastern Kingdoms, haunted by werewolves, ghosts, and the remnants of a fallen kingdom.

**E for Elwynn Forest:** The starting zone for Alliance players, a peaceful (relatively) woodland region under the protection of Stormwind.

**F for Feralas:** A lush, untamed jungle in Kalimdor, home to the furbolgs, harpies, and the Emerald Dream's influence.

**G for Gadgetzan:** A lawless, goblin-run trading post in Tanaris, known for its shady dealings and questionable entertainment.

**H for Hinterlands:** A rugged, mountainous region in Eastern Kingdoms, contested by the Alliance and the remnants of the Black Dragonflight.

**I for Ironforge:** The grand, dwarven city carved into the mountains of Dun Morogh, a bastion of engineering and tradition.

**J for Jungle Stranglethorn:** A dense, dangerous jungle in the southern part of Stranglethorn Vale, filled with trolls, raptors, and pirates.

**K for Karazhan:** A mysterious, abandoned tower in the Barrens, rumored to be the former home of the sorcerer Medivh. (Though not fully explorable in Vanilla, its presence is felt.)

**L for Loch Modan:** A cold, mountainous region in Eastern Kingdoms, home to the dwarves of Ironforge and the remnants of the wildhammer clan.

**M for Maraudon:** A massive, ancient troll city in Desolace, overrun by centaurs and corrupted by the Emerald Dream.

**O for Orgrimmar:** The capital city of the Horde, a harsh, utilitarian fortress built in Durotar.

**P for Plaguelands:** The blighted, undead-infested regions of Lordaeron, ravaged by the Scourge. (Eastern Plaguelands and Western Plaguelands)

**Q for Quel'Thalas:** The homeland of the high elves, a beautiful but isolated kingdom in the northern part of Eastern Kingdoms.

**R for Redridge Mountains:** A rugged, mountainous region in Eastern Kingdoms, plagued by bandits, gnolls, and the remnants of a fallen kingdom.

**S for Scholomance:** A dark, abandoned academy in the Eastern Plaguelands, now overrun by undead and corrupted magic.

**T for Tanaris:** A scorching desert region in Kalimdor, home to Gadgetzan, pirates, and the mysterious Silithid.

**U for Un'Goro Crater:** A prehistoric jungle in Kalimdor, teeming with dinosaurs, strange plants, and the remnants of titan experiments.

**V for Vanilla (World of Warcraft):** The original, unexpanded version of the game itself. The foundation of everything.

**W for Winterspring:** A snowy, forested region in Kalimdor, home to the furbolgs, night elves, and the remnants of the Burning Legion's influence.

**X for Xavien's Hold:** A small, abandoned outpost in the Hinterlands, once a strategic location for the Alliance.

**Y for Ysondre's Grove:** A hidden grove in Feralas, sacred to the Emerald Dream and guarded by the night elves.

**Z for Zul'Farrak:** A massive, ancient troll city in Tanaris, overrun by the Atal'ai tribe and guarded by powerful loa spirits.



There you have it. Every letter of the alphabet represented by a place in Vanilla WoW lore. Some were easier than others, but I tried to stick to locations that were actually present and relevant in the original game. [end of text]
