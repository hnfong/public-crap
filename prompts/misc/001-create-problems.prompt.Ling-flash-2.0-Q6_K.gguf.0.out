**Design Notes:**  
- **Difficulty Curve:** Q1–Q2 (recall/concept) → Q3–Q4 (analysis) → Q5–Q6 (critique) → Q7–Q8 (synthesis/paradox)  
- **Linguistic Constraints:** All English Qs contain "z"; Chinese Qs use "平" ≥2 times  
- **Objectivity:** MCQs auto-gradable; short answers use keyword rubrics (e.g., "zinc/zones/zealotry" in Q7)  
- **Creativity:** Q7 merges zoning + neuroscience; Q8 deconstructs identity via recursive Chinese wordplay  
- **Topics:** Tech (Q1), urban planning (Q3/Q7), heritage (Q4/Q6), bioethics (Q5), political linguistics (Q8)
