Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Give me your interpretation. You do not have to translate the contents, but you may if you wish.

The lyrics tell the story of a small restaurant in the forest. The restaurant is always empty, and despite its efforts to attract customers, nobody ever comes. The menu is full of recommended dishes, but the only sounds coming from the kitchen are the melodies of a violin, flute, cello, and viola. The narrator welcomes the reader and encourages them to enjoy the food and relax, but eventually says goodbye and wishes everyone a good night. The next day, the restaurant will continue its routine, with the animals in the forest dancing to the music played by the instruments. The final line suggests that the restaurant is willing to go to great lengths to serve its customers, even reaching the grave. The overall theme is one of whimsy and a touch of melancholy, as the restaurant's efforts seem to be in vain.
