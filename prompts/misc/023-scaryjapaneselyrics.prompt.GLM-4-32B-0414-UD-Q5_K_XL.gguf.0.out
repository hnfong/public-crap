Okay, let's break down the story told by these lyrics.

**Interpretation:**

The lyrics tell the story of a very peculiar, almost non-existent restaurant hidden deep within the forest. Here's the narrative:

1.  **The Elusive Location:** The journey begins by following an acorn ("ドングリを辿って"), suggesting a natural, perhaps whimsical, path. However, this path doesn't lead anywhere ("着きません"). The destination is the "small restaurant in the forest" ("森の小さなレストラン"), emphasizing its hidden and perhaps intangible nature.
2.  **The Empty Establishment:** The restaurant is characterized by its emptiness. The visitor fiddles with their empty pockets ("空っぽのポケットを弄って"), perhaps symbolizing a lack of means or simply adding to the surreal atmosphere. They somehow manage to reach it ("忘れた人から辿り着く" - reaching from the people who forgot, implying it's a place for those lost in memory or perhaps just a strange way of saying arrival). There are no reservations ("予約は一つもありません") and it's completely empty, even during lunchtime ("空席だらけのランチ時"). The only observers are birds, seemingly laughing ("小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる"), adding a touch of mischievousness and highlighting the lack of human presence.
3.  **The Strange Ambiance:** Despite being empty, the restaurant has distinct features. It has a bright red tin roof ("真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根"). The menu is bizarrely limited, offering only recommendations ("メニューはおすすめ そればかり"). From the kitchen comes an unusual orchestra of string instruments ("バイオリン フルート �チェロ ビオラ"), creating a lighthearted but slightly eerie soundscape.
4.  **The Bizarre Welcome and Menu:** The host welcomes guests ("ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい") with an invitation to eat heartily and then sleep ("たらふく食べたらお眠りよ"). The farewell is abrupt and cryptic ("それでは皆さんさようなら / 明日は明日で エトセトラ"). The staff and patrons, if you can call them that, are equally strange: a flustered person rushes by ("右から左へおおわらわ") and a pet bear starts dancing ("手乗りの子熊も踊り出す").
5.  **The Final Course:** The menu items listed are real European dishes ("カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル / リゾット"), but the dessert is missing ("デザートはありません"). The most striking and fantastical element is the final line: "お墓の中まで届けましょう / 今宵は最後のフルコース" (Let's deliver it even to inside the grave / Tonight is the last full course). This suggests the restaurant serves something that transcends life and death, perhaps a final meal or experience for souls, or maybe it's a metaphorical journey ending in oblivion.

**Story Summary:**

The story is about discovering a hidden, empty, and slightly absurd restaurant in the forest. It's a place that defies normal logic – you can't find it easily, it has no customers, its menu is nonsensical, its staff are bizarre, and its music comes from an unseen orchestra. The host welcomes guests for a final, grand meal ("full course") that is so significant it can supposedly be delivered even to the dead. It's a whimsical, mischievous, and ultimately fantastical tale of a place existing just beyond the bounds of the ordinary world, perhaps serving as a final stop or a strange memorial.

This interpretation is literal within the context of the fantastical setting presented by the lyrics. It's not just metaphorical; it describes a specific, strange place and its peculiar events. [end of text]
