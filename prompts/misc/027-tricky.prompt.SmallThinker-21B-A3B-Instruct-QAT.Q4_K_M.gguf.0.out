A) **No**, water does not freeze at -12°C under standard atmospheric pressure. Water freezes at 0°C (32°F) under normal conditions. At -12°C, water remains liquid unless supercooled (a metastable state below 0°C) or under specific conditions like high pressure.  

B) **If the water is pure and cooled to -12°C**, it will not freeze unless it is supercooled. Supercooled water is unstable and can freeze instantly if disturbed (e.g., by adding a nucleation site like a dust particle). However, under normal conditions, the water would stay liquid at -12°C.
