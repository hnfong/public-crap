A) **No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius under normal conditions.** Water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. However, under certain conditions, such as supercooling, water can remain liquid below 0 degrees Celsius.

B) **If a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will likely freeze, but not necessarily immediately.** Pure water can be supercooled to temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius without freezing if it lacks nucleation sites (such as impurities or rough surfaces) for ice crystals to form. However, at -12 degrees Celsius, the likelihood of spontaneous freezing increases significantly. If the water does not freeze immediately, any disturbance (like tapping the glass or introducing a nucleation site) can trigger rapid freezing. [end of text]
