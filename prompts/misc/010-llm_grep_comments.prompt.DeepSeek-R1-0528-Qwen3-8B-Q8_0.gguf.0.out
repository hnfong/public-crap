We are only interested in lines that have comments (i.e., lines starting with #)
 But note: the query says "obviously matches", so we must be cautious.
 However, in this context, the query is "all lines with comments", so we are to output every line that starts with a comment.

 Let's go through the input and check for lines that start with #.

 Line 1: #!/bin/bash -> starts with comment, output.
 Line 2: set -ex -> does not start with comment, ignore.
 Line 3: empty line -> ignore.
 Line 4: # Save the path to ./download_check script -> starts with comment, output.
 Line 5: script_path=$(python3 -c 'import os,sys; print(os.path.realpath(sys.argv[1]))' "$0") -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 6: download_check_path=$(dirname "$script_path")/download_check -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 7: empty line -> ignore.
 Line 8: function download_and_check() { -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 9:     set -e -> no comment, ignore.

 Line 30: download_and_check 'https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ncurses/ncurses-6.5.tar.gz' -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 31: tar zxvf ncurses-6.5.tar.gz -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 32: cd ncurses-6.5 -> no comment, ignore.

 Line 34: make -j 10 -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 35: make install -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 36: cd .. -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 37: empty line -> ignore.
 Line 38: # Download and build libevent -> starts with comment, output.
 Line 39: download_and_check 'https://github.com/libevent/libevent/releases/download/release-2.1.12-stable/libevent-2.1.12-stable.tar.gz' -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 40: tar zxvf libevent-2.1.12-stable.tar.gz -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 41: cd libevent-2.1.12-stable -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 42: ./configure --disable-openssl --prefix="$prefix" -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 43: make -j 10 -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 44: make install -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 45: cd .. -> no comment, ignore.

 Line 47: # Download and build utf8proc -> starts with comment, output.
 Line 48: download_and_check 'https://github.com/JuliaStrings/utf8proc/releases/download/v2.9.0/utf8proc-2.9.0.tar.gz' -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 49: tar zxvf utf8proc-2.9.0.tar.gz -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 50: cd utf8proc-2.9.0 -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 51: make prefix="$prefix" -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 52: make install prefix="$prefix" -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 53: cd .. -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 54: empty line -> ignore.
 Line 55: # Download and build tmux -> starts with comment, output.
 Line 56: download_and_check 'https://github.com/tmux/tmux/releases/download/3.5a/tmux-3.5a.tar.gz' -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 57: tar zxvf tmux-3.5a.tar.gz -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 58: cd tmux-3.5a -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 59: PKG_CONFIG="$prefix"/bin/pkg-config ./configure --enable-utf8proc --prefix="$prefix" -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 60: make -j 10 -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 61: make install -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 62: cd .. -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 63: empty line -> ignore.
 Line 64: # Download and build tmux -> wait, note that line 55 was already a comment, but let's check line 64: 
        Actually, line 64 is: cd .. -> no comment, ignore.
 Line 65: ln -sf "$prefix"/bin/tmux ~/bin/tmux -> no comment, ignore.

 However, note that the input has two empty lines (line 3 and line 7) and some blank lines (like line 46 and 54) but we are only concerned with comments.

 Let's list the matching lines:

 1: #!/bin/bash
 4: # Save the path to ./download_check script
 15: # This is a script to build and install tmux on macOS without homebrew.
 20: # Download and build pkg-config
 29: # Download and build ncurses
 38: # Download and build libevent
 47: # Download and build utf8proc
 55: # Download and build tmux

 But wait, note that the input has two lines that are comments and say "Download and build tmux": one at line 15 and one at line 55. We are to output both.

 However, note that the script also has a comment at line 15 that is not about downloading and building, but about the purpose of the script.

 We are to output every line that has a comment (starts with #) and is obviously related to the query. The query is "all lines with comments", so we are just looking for comments.

 But note: the query says "obviously matches", so we must be cautious. However, in this case, every comment line is about the process of building and installing, which is the context.

 Let's output the lines that start with # and are not empty.

 However, note that the first line (line 1) is a shebang and is considered a comment in Unix scripts.

 We are to output the line number and the line.

 Important: after each line of output, emit a "---".

 Let's write the output accordingly.
