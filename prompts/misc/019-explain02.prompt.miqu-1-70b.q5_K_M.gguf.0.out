 Sure, imagine if your class at school had a big meeting where everyone got to talk about what they thought was important for your school. The National People's Congress (NPC) is kind of like that, but for all of China. It's a big group of people who come together once a year to talk about what they think is important for their country. They make decisions about laws and rules, and they also choose the leaders of the country. Even though it's in China and not in London, it's still important to know about because China is a big country and what happens there can affect the whole world. [end of text]
