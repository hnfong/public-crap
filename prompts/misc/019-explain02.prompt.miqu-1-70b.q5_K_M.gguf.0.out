Sure, I'd be happy to explain that in a simple way! 

Imagine you're playing a big game of pretend where you're the king or queen of a magical kingdom. You make the rules and decisions for your kingdom, right? But, it's a lot of work and there are many things to think about. So, you ask some of your most trusted friends to help you. You ask them to gather together and discuss what's best for the kingdom. They listen to the wishes and needs of all the people living in the kingdom, and then they make suggestions to you.

In China, the National People's Congress is like that group of trusted friends. They are chosen by the people of China to represent them and make decisions about laws and policies. They meet once a year to discuss and decide on important matters for the country. Just like in your pretend kingdom, they try to make decisions that are best for all the people living in China.
