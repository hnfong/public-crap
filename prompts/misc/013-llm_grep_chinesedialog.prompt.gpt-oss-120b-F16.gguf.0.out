<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to output lines that contain dialog or spoken text. In Chinese text, dialog is indicated by 「...」 or maybe quotes. Also lines with spoken text like "..." maybe. So we need to list line numbers and content for each line that obviously contains spoken text.

Let's scan input lines:

1: "# 呆總嘅老豆" not dialog.

4: 「轟隆！」 -> dialog. line 4.

8: 「啊～！」... also contains dialog. line 8.

12: 「轟隆！」 ... line 12.

27: 「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」 line 27.

29: 「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」 line 29.

33: I「屌」? Actually line 33: 我「屌」一聲... That's a spoken exclamation inside quotes but it's part of narration? It's a spoken sound "屌". Might count as dialog? It's a sound, but still quoted. Probably yes.

39: 「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 line 39.

41: 「！！！」 line 41 (just exclamation). Might be spoken.

46: 「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」 line 46.

48: 「？？？」 line 48.

50: 「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」 line 50.

Also line 33 includes 「屌」 but it's a sound; still qualifies.

Also line 33 includes "我「屌」一聲". That's a spoken sound.

Also line 33 maybe not considered dialog but still.

Also line 33 includes quotes but not typical dialog.

Also line 33 is line number 33.

Also line 33 includes "我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮". So yes.

Also line 33 is line number 33.

Also line 33 is after line 31 blank lines.

Also line 33.

Also line 33.

Also line 33.

Now also line 33 includes "我「屌」一聲". That's a spoken exclamation.

Also line 33.

Now also line 33.

Ok.

Also line 33.

Now produce output lines with line number and content, each separated by "---".

We need to output exactly as "semantic_grep" would: line number, colon, space, then line content? The input lines are numbered with numbers and colon? Actually the input lines show numbers then colon? Example: "1:# 呆總嘅老豆". So line numbers are part of the line. We need to output the line (together with line number). So we output exactly the line as is.

Thus output lines:

4:「轟隆！」
8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」
12:「轟隆！」 呢次雷聲，果然帶來傾盤大雨，屋外屋頂雨聲不絕。
27:「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」
29:「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。難怪我同佢對打可以力拔山河。平時我邊有咁大力？佢口裡強硬，卻一個翻身跳出牆外，似乎想逃走。
33:我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕。
39:「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 我抑壓心抵嘅震驚，若無其事咁問。
41:「！！！」 黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我。佢點都估唔到我認得呢把劍。原來係熔癌派人追殺我。
46:「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」
48:「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔，我忽然醒起熔癌唔識英文。
50:「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」

Check line 33: includes quotes but not typical dialog; still qualifies.

Now produce output with "---" after each line.

Let's format:
