 Bob is not entirely right but he is not wrong either. When water is cooled from room temperature, it first becomes very visibly dense as it approaches 4 degrees Celsius. After that, it remains at 4 degrees Celsius until all of it is at that temperature. Only then will it continue to cool and freeze at 0 degrees Celsius. 

However, at atmospheric pressure, water can supercool to -10 degrees Celsius and still remain liquid. So, if there is no impurity or nucleation site in the water, it could technically be cooled to -10 degrees Celsius without freezing. But this is a rare occurrence in everyday life.

So, in a more practical sense, Alice is correct that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, not -10 degrees Celsius. [end of text]
