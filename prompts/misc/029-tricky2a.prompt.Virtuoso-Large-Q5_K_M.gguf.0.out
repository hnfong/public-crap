Alice is correct in pointing out that water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. However, Bob's statement can be understood in a different context.

When water is cooled to -10 degrees Celsius, it is well below the freezing point of 0 degrees Celsius. Under normal conditions, water at -10 degrees Celsius would indeed be frozen. However, pure water can sometimes remain in a liquid state below 0 degrees Celsius in a process called supercooling, but this is not common and requires very specific conditions (such as the absence of nucleation sites).

So, in a general context:
- Alice is correct that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.
- Bob is correct that water at -10 degrees Celsius is typically frozen.

To reconcile their statements:
- Alice is emphasizing the standard freezing point.
- Bob is emphasizing the typical state of water at -10 degrees Celsius.

Both are right from their respective perspectives, but Bob's statement is more contextually accurate for the temperature given. [end of text]
