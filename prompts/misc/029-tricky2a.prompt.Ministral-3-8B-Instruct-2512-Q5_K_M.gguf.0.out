Both Alice and Bob are correct, but in slightly different contexts:

- **Alice** is correct in the **standard definition** of water's freezing point: **pure water freezes at 0°C (32°F) at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm)**. This is the well-known phase transition point for pure H₂O.

- **Bob** is correct in a **practical or real-world sense**: **water can freeze (or start forming ice crystals) at temperatures below 0°C** due to:
  - **Supercooling**: Pure water can be cooled below 0°C without freezing if it lacks nucleation sites (e.g., dust, impurities, or surfaces to initiate ice formation). This is why Bob’s statement isn’t *wrong*—it’s just describing a phenomenon where water *appears* to defy the standard freezing point.
  - **Impurities**: Salt, minerals, or other solutes in water **lower the freezing point** (e.g., seawater freezes at ~-2°C). Bob’s "freezing" could also refer to this scenario.

### Key Takeaway:
- **Alice** is right about *pure water* under normal conditions.
- **Bob** is right about *real-world water* (supercooled or impure), where freezing can occur below 0°C.

Both perspectives are valid depending on context! [end of text]
