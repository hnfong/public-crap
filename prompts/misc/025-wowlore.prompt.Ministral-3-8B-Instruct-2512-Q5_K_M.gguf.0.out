Here’s a list of places in *World of Warcraft* vanilla lore (pre-*The Burning Crusade*) for each letter of the alphabet, starting with "A for Azeroth":

- **A for Azeroth** – **Azeroth** (The world itself)
- **B for Blackrock** – **Blackrock Mountain** (Home of the Blackrock clan)
- **C for Cenarion** – **Cenarion Circle** (Elf druidic order)
- **D for Durotar** – **Durotar** (Tauren homeland)
- **E for Elwynn** – **Elwynn Forest** (Human starting zone)
- **F for Forsaken** – **Forsaken** (Undead capital, **Teldrassil** before the Scourge)
- **G for Goldshire** – **Goldshire** (Human town in Elwynn Forest)
- **H for Hellfire** – **Hellfire Peninsula** (Burning lands near the Shattrath)
- **I for Ironforge** – **Ironforge** (Dwarven capital)
- **J for Jaina** – **Jaina Proudmoore** (Not a place, but **Jaina’s Tower** in Northrend is post-expansion; closest vanilla is **Dalaran** where she was once a leader)
   - *Alternative: **Jail Cell** (e.g., **Stormwind Jail**) – Not lore-specific, but fits the letter.*
- **K for Khaz Modan** – **Khaz Modan** (Dwarven homeland)
- **L for Loch Modan** – **Loch Modan** (Lake in Khaz Modan)
- **M for Menethil** – **Menethil Harbor** (Human port city)
- **N for Northrend** – **Northrend** (Frozen continent)
- **O for Orgrimmar** – **Orgrimmar** (Orc capital)
- **P for Pegasus** – **Pegasus Peak** (Mountain in Elwynn Forest)
- **Q for Quel’Thalas** – **Quel’Thalas** (High Elf kingdom)
- **R for Redridge** – **Redridge Mountains** (Human region)
- **S for Silverpine** – **Silverpine Forest** (Gnome homeland)
- **T for Teldrassil** – **Teldrassil** (Elf capital before the Scourge)
- **U for Undercity** – **Undercity** (Forsaken capital)
- **V for Val’Sharah** – **Val’Sharah** (Dwarven city in Khaz Modan)
- **W for Winterspring** – **Winterspring** (Frozen region in Northrend)
- **X for Xavius** – **Xavius** (Not a place, but **Xavius’ Tower** in Northrend is post-expansion; closest is **Blackrock Depths** where he was imprisoned)
   - *Alternative: **Xoroth** (A demonic entity, but no place named Xoroth in vanilla lore. This is tricky!)*
- **Y for Ysera** – **Ysera’s Grove** (Druidic sanctuary in Elwynn Forest)
- **Z for Zangarmarsh** – **Zangarmarsh** (Swamp near Shattrath)

### Notes:
- Some letters (like **J** and **X**) are challenging due to limited vanilla lore options. I’ve included alternatives where necessary.
- **X** is particularly difficult since no place in vanilla lore starts with "X." If you’d prefer a different letter, I can adjust! [end of text]
