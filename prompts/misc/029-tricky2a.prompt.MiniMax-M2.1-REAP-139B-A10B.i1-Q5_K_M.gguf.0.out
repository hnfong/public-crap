Both are partially correct, but Bob’s statement is more precise. Water (liquid water) freezes at 0 °C, meaning it transitions from liquid to solid at that temperature. However, Bob’s claim that “water freezes at -10 °C” is incorrect because the freezing point is 0 °C, not -10 °C. So Alice is right that water freezes at 0 °C, while Bob is wrong about the specific temperature. The correct answer is that water freezes at 0 °C.
