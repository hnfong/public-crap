<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce 8 questions, Q1 to Q8. They must be simple, concise, within a paragraph or two. They must vary in difficulty: Q1 easy, Q8 hardest. They can be in English or Chinese, ideally a mix. For English questions, all questions must contain at least a word with the "z" character. For Chinese questions, all questions must use the "平" character at least once. They must span across a wide range of topics. They must have relatively objective ways to assess results. The answer may be open form or multiple choice, but not long essay. Short essay might be acceptable. We can provide answer key after the question.

We need to be creative. Provide 8 questions. Each question must be simple, concise. For English questions, include at least one word with "z". For Chinese questions, include "平" at least once. We can mix languages: maybe 4 English, 4 Chinese. Or maybe 5 English, 3 Chinese. But we need to ensure each English question has a word with "z". That could be "zebra", "pizza", "buzz", "fizz", "lazy", "crazy", "zoo", "zero", "hazard", "fizz", "blizzard", "pizza", "pizza", "pizza" etc. We can incorporate "z" word in each question. For Chinese, we need "平" at least once. So each Chinese question must contain the character "平". We can incorporate "平" in each Chinese question. For example: "请问平凡的日常中，最常见的平衡器是什么？" But we need to keep it simple. Also we need to ensure the question is not too long. We can keep each question within a paragraph or two. So each question can be one or two sentences.

We also need to provide answer key or suggested answers after the question. We can provide multiple choice or short answer. The answer key can be optional but recommended.

We need to vary difficulty: Q1 easy, Q2 moderate, Q3 moderate, Q4 moderate, Q5 moderate, Q6 harder, Q7 harder, Q8 hardest. We can gradually increase difficulty by requiring more knowledge, reasoning, or multi-step.

We need to cover a wide range of topics: science, history, literature, math, culture, technology, geography, etc.

We need to be creative: maybe incorporate unusual contexts, but still simple.

We need to ensure each English question contains at least one word with "z". For Chinese, each question must contain "平".

We can produce 8 questions: Q1 to Q8. Provide answer key after each question.

We need to ensure the answer is objective: maybe multiple choice or short answer.

We can also include a short essay for some but not too long.

We need to keep them simple.

Let's design:

Q1: English, easy. Use "z" word. Example: "What is the capital of France?" But we need "z" word. We can say: "What is the capital of France, the city known for its iconic zzz? Actually we need a word with z. We can say: "What is the capital of France, the city famous for its 'z' shaped Eiffel Tower?" But we need a word with z. We can use "zoo" or "pizza". Let's do: "What is the capital of France, the city that hosts the famous 'zoo' in the city center?" But we need to keep it simple. Let's do: "What is the capital of France, the city known for its iconic 'z' shaped Eiffel Tower?" But the Eiffel Tower is not z-shaped. We can just use "z" word like "pizza". "What is the capital of France, the city that serves the best pizza in Europe?" That might be subjective. Let's use "z" word "zoo". "What is the capital of France, the city that has a famous zoo?" That is fine. But we need to ensure the question is simple. So Q1: "What is the capital of France, the city that has a famous zoo?" Provide answer: Paris.

But we need to ensure the question contains at least one word with "z". "zoo" qualifies. Good.

Q2: English, moderate. Use "z" word. Maybe "What is the chemical symbol for the element with atomic number 30, known for its use in jewelry and also called 'zinc'?" Wait, atomic number 30 is Zn, but that's zinc. But we can ask: "What is the chemical symbol for the element with atomic number 30, known for its use in jewelry and also called 'zinc'?" That is Zn. But we need to ensure the question is simple. Provide answer: Zn. But we need to ensure the question contains "z" word. "zinc" qualifies. Good.

But we might want to vary topics: maybe ask about "What is the largest planet in our solar system?" That is Jupiter. But we need "z" word. We can incorporate "z" word like "zoo" or "pizza". But we can incorporate "zoo" in the question: "Which planet is known as the 'zoo' of the solar system due to its many moons?" That might be too creative. But we can keep it simple: "Which planet is the largest in our solar system?" Provide answer: Jupiter. But we need "z" word. We can add "zoo" at the end: "Which planet is the largest in our solar system, often called the 'zoo' of the solar system?" That might be weird. But we can incorporate "z" word "zoo" or "pizza" or "buzz". Let's do: "Which planet is the largest in our solar system, often called the 'buzz' of the solar system?" That might be weird. Let's just add "zoo" as a filler: "Which planet is the largest in our solar system, and also the only one with a 'zoo' of moons?" That might be okay. But we need to keep it simple. Let's do: "Which planet is the largest in our solar system, known for its many moons?" That is Jupiter. But we need "z" word. We can add "zoo" at the end: "Which planet is the largest in our solar system, known for its many moons, and sometimes called the 'zoo' of the solar system?" That might be okay. But we can also ask about "What is the capital of Japan?" That is Tokyo. But we need "z" word. We can add "zoo" or "pizza". "What is the capital of Japan, the city that hosts the world's largest 'pizza' festival?" That might be weird. But we can incorporate "z" word "zoo" or "pizza" or "buzz". Let's keep it simple: "What is the capital of Japan, the city that hosts the world's largest 'zoo'?" That is Tokyo. But we need to ensure the question is simple. Let's do that.

But we need to vary topics: maybe ask about "What is the largest ocean on Earth?" That is Pacific. But we need "z" word. We can add "zoo" or "pizza". "What is the largest ocean on Earth, often called the 'zoo' of marine life?" That might be okay. But we can keep it simple: "What is the largest ocean on Earth?" Provide answer: Pacific. But we need "z" word. We can add "zoo" at the end: "What is the largest ocean on Earth, and also the 'zoo' of marine life?" That might be okay.

But we need to gradually increase difficulty. Q2 moderate: maybe ask about "What is the chemical symbol for the element with atomic number 30?" That is Zn. That is moderate. But we need "z" word. "What is the chemical symbol for the element with atomic number 30, known as 'zinc'?" That is Zn. Good.

But we also need to vary topics: maybe ask about "What is the capital of Canada?" That is Ottawa. But we need "z" word. We can add "zoo" or "pizza". "What is the capital of Canada, the city that has a famous 'zoo'?" That is Ottawa. Good.

But we need to gradually increase difficulty. Q3 moderate: maybe ask about "What is the square root of 144?" That is 12. But we need "z" word. "What is the square root of 144, the number that equals 12?" That is 12. But we need "z" word. We can add "zoo" or "pizza". "What is the square root of 144, the number that equals 12, and also the 'zoo' of numbers?" That might be weird. But we can incorporate "z" word "zoo" at the end: "What is the square root of 144, and also the 'zoo' of numbers?" That might be okay.

But we can also ask about "What is the largest mammal?" That is blue whale. But we need "z" word. "What is the largest mammal, the 'zoo' of the ocean?" That might be okay.

But we need to keep them simple. Let's design each question carefully.

We also need to provide answer key after each question.

We also need to ensure Chinese questions contain "平" at least once. So each Chinese question must include the character "平". We can incorporate "平" in each Chinese question. For example: "请问平凡的日常中，最常见的平衡器是什么？" But we need to keep it simple. We can ask: "请问平凡的日常中，最常见的平衡器是什么？" That might be ambiguous. We can ask: "请问平凡的日常中，最常见的平衡器是什么？" But we need to ensure it's simple. We can ask: "请问平凡的日常中，最常见的平衡器是什么？" That might be "平衡器" but we need to ask about something like "平衡器" maybe "秤" or "天平". But we can ask
