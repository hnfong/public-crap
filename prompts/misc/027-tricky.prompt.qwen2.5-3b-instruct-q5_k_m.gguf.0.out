Let's address each question step by step.

### A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?

No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius (or 32 degrees Fahrenheit). Water will freeze at this temperature or below, but not at -12 degrees Celsius.

### B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?

If you have a glass of pure water and you cool it down to -12 degrees Celsius, the water will not freeze. Instead, it will remain in a liquid state because it is below the freezing point of water (0 degrees Celsius). However, if you continue to cool the water further, it will eventually reach the freezing point of water (0 degrees Celsius) and then begin to freeze.

To summarize:
- At -12 degrees Celsius, water is in a liquid state.
- If you continue cooling it, it will eventually reach 0 degrees Celsius and then start to freeze. [end of text]
