Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to act as a semantic grep, which means I need to find lines in the input that contain dialogue or spoken text. The key here is to identify lines where characters are talking, as opposed to narrative descriptions or action beats.

First, I'll look at the input provided. The lines are in Chinese, but the structure might include quotation marks or indicators of speech. For example, lines starting with a quote like 「轟隆！」 (which is "Boom!") are likely dialogue. Also, lines that have characters addressing each other, like the conversation between the protagonist and the black衣人 (black-clad person).

I need to check each line to see if it's part of a spoken exchange. Lines that are action descriptions, like "雷聲不絕" (thunder continues) or references to the environment, like "屋頂落雨嘅滴嗒聲" (the rain on the roof's dripping sound), shouldn't be included unless they're part of a character's dialogue. However, sometimes action lines might include spoken words, like the exclamation marks in the text.

Looking at the lines:

Line 4: 「轟隆！」 — This is an exclamation, likely dialogue. So include this.

Line 8: 「啊～！」 followed by dialogue. The entire line is part of the spoken dialogue between characters.

Line 12: 「轟隆！」 — Another exclamation, part of dialogue.

Line 27: 「哼, 大胆狂徒, 你係边个! 点解要暗算老夫！」 — This is definitely dialogue. Include.

Line 29: 「你做咁多伤天害理嘅事, 今日我要替天行道!」 — Another line of dialogue.

Line 39: 「你係咪熔癌嘅人?!」 — Dialogue.

Line 46: 「阿呆, 哎暗若餓花打.」 — This seems like dialogue, even if the translation is unclear. Since it's a line spoken by a character, it should be included.

Line 48: 「?????」 — Exclamation marks indicating dialogue confusion. Part of the spoken interaction.

Line 50: 「我先唔係你老豆呀, 哼哼.」 — Dialogue.

Now, I need to go through each line and check if it contains any spoken text. For example, line 5 is empty, so no. Line 6 is "平靜嘅夜空..." which is narrative, not dialogue. Line 9 is about the weather, narrative. Line 10 mentions the钦天监, which is part of the plot but not dialogue. Line 14 describes the character's thoughts, not dialogue. Line 17 is an image, so no. Line 19 mentions "屋顶多咗一个人," which is part of the narrative description, not dialogue. Line 20 is empty. Line 21 describes actions and thoughts, not dialogue. Line 23 mentions the door being kicked open, which is action. Line 24 is the protagonist drawing the sword, action. Line 25 describes the fight, action. Line 26 is action. Line 27 is dialogue. Line 28 is the protagonist's line. Line 29 is the black-clad person's line. Line 30 is an image. Line 33 is action. Line 34 is action. Line 35 is the protagonist's thought. Line 36 is a question. Line 37 is the protagonist's monologue. Line 38 is the black-clad person's reaction. Line 39 is the protagonist's line. Line 40 is the black-clad person's line. Line 41 is their reaction. Line 42 is the protagonist's line. Line 43 is the black-clad person's line. Line 44 is the protagonist's line. Line 45 is empty. Line 46 is dialogue. Line 47 is the black-clad person's confused response. Line 48 is the protagonist's line. Line 49 is the black-clad person's line. Line 50 is the protagonist's line. Line 51 is empty. Line 52 is the ending.

Wait, but some lines might be in Chinese, and the presence of quotation marks (like 「」) is a strong indicator. Also, lines that have characters' names or dialogue tags (like 'said') can be indicators, but in this case, it's more about the presence of speech within the line.

So, the lines that contain dialogue are those with 「...」, or explicit speech actions. Let's list each line and check:

1: 呆總嘅老豆 — No dialogue here. It's a title or name.

2: Empty. No.

3: Empty. No.

4: 「轟隆！」 — Yes. Include.

5: Empty. No.

6: 平靜嘅夜空... — No. Narrative.

7: 乾雷. — Part of the action, not dialogue.

8: 「啊～！」... — Yes. Includes dialogue.

9: ...月光被黑雲淹浸. — Narrative.

10: 欣天监...十万人... — Narrative.

11: 轰隆...大雨. — Action, but the '轰隆' is part of the action. Not dialogue.

Wait, line 11: 「轰隆！」 呢次雷声... — The first part is in quotes, so that's dialogue. So line 11 starts with a quoted exclamation. So line 11 should be included.

Wait, line 11 is: "11:「轟隆！」 呢次雷聲，屋外屋頂雨聲不絕。" The first part is in quotes, so that's dialogue. So line 11 is part of the dialogue.

Similarly, line 4 is 「轟隆！」 which is dialogue. So lines 4, 8, 11, 27, 29, 39, 40, 46, 48, 50.

Wait, let's go line by line again:

Line 1: No.

Line 2: Empty.

Line 3: Empty.

Line4: 「轟隆！」 — yes.

Line5: Empty.

Line6: 平靜嘅夜空... — no.

Line7: 乾雷. — part of action, not dialogue.

Line8: 「啊～！」老夫同... — yes.

Line9: ...月光一早被黑雲淹浸. — no.

Line10: 欣天监...十万人... — no.

Line11: 「轟隆！」 — yes.

Line12: 呢次雷声... — no, the rest is narrative.

Line13: ...打算彎低身... — no.

Line14: ...屋頂落雨嘅滴嗒声... — no.

Line15: ...忽然觉得唔对路. — no.

Line16: Empty.

Line17:![image] — no.

Line18: Empty.

Line19: 屋顶 ... 多咗一个人. — no, it's a description.

Line20: Empty.

Line21: ...有人喺屋顶跳落... — no, it's action description.

Line22: ...踢爆. — action.

Line23: ...厅门已经「嘭！」一聲被踢爆. — the "嘭!" is in quotes, so dialogue. So line23 includes dialogue.

Wait, line23: "厅门已经「嘭！」一聲被踢爆." The 「嘭！」 is an exclamation, part of dialogue. So line23 should be included.

Similarly, line25: ...刺中我右肩. — action.

Wait, let's check each line again carefully.

Line4: 「轟隆！」 — yes.

Line8: 「啊～！」 — yes.

Line11: 「轟隆！」 — yes.

Line23: 「嘭！」 — yes.

Line27: 「哼, 大胆狂徒, 你係边个! 点解要暗算老夫！」 — yes.

Line29: 「你做咁多伤天害理嘅事, 今日我要替天行道!」 — yes.

Line39: 「你係咪熔癌嘅人?!」 — yes.

Line40: 「！！！」 — the exclamation marks, but the line says: "29: ...「你做咁多伤天害理嘅事, 今日我要替天行道！」听黑衣人嘅声音..." So line29 is the dialogue. Then line40: "40: ...黑衣人驚訖嘅眼神已经回答咗我。佢点都估唔到我認得呢把剑。原来係熔癌派人追殺我。断估係佢唔抵得我投靠朝庭咁多年都死唔去，派人嚟送我一程。" No dialogue here. Wait, line40 is part of the narrative. Wait, the user's input shows line40 as:

40:
41:「！！！」 黑衣人驚訖嘅眼神已经回答咗我。佢点都估唔到我認得呢把剑。原来係熔癌派人追殺我。断估係佢唔抵得我投靠朝庭咁多年都死唔去，派人嚟送我一程。
42:
43:我望住呢个嚟刺杀我嘅黑衣女人，定睛细看，确定咗我心底嘅疑惑之后，緩慢咁講：
44:
45:
46:「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」
47:
48:「？？？」 佢一臉迷惘，我忽然醒起熔癌唔識英文。
49:「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」
50:
51:【完】

Wait, line40 is empty? Let me check the original input again. The user's input shows:

Line 39: 37:呢把剑係当年党主席赐我嘅礼物，剑身刻有「HARRRR～！！！」嘅洋文，极霸气。自從熔癌之役之后，我就冇见过呢把剑，点解会重现人间呢？

39: 39:「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 我抑压心抵嘅震惊，若无其事咁问。

Wait, the user's input has lines numbered from 1 to 52. Let me recount:

Looking at the input:

1:# 呆總嘅老豆

2:

3:

4:「轟隆！」

5:

6:平靜嘅夜空，竟然响起乾雷。

7:

8:「啊～！」老夫同汉昭烈帝一样係盖世英雄，立即虎口剧震，筷子连同夹紧嘅叉烧一齐跌咗落地。「⋯⋯吓死老夫喇。」

9:

10:我望住屋外天色，月光一早被黑云淹没，湿气极重。钦天监今次仲唔挂黑色暴雨警告的话，听朝睇怕会有十万人上书皇上，叫佢炒咗嗰班粉肠。

11:

12:「轰隆！」 呢次雷声，果然带来倾盆大雨，屋外屋顶雨声不绝。

13:

14:我喺呢间屋已经孤独度过十八个寒暑，屋顶落雨嘅滴嗒声每一个细节，一早了然于胸。我正打算弯低身执返嚿叉烧嗰阵，忽然觉得唔对路。

15:

16:

17:![image]

18:

19:屋顶 ⋯⋯ 多咗一个人。

20:

21:我手握剑柄，六神归一，留心倾听。果然有人喺屋顶跳落后庭院！轻盈嘅脚步声极之细微，来者显然学过轻功。如果唔係忽然落大雨，敌人嘅突袭可能已经得手。

22:

23:脚步声越近，我腰间宝剑出鞘嘅一刻，厅门已经「嘭！」一声被踢爆。

24:

25:好在老夫力拔山河气盖世，虽然咁样斩法我肯定宝剑见财化水，但刀剑相交嘅时候，我感觉到对方力气似乎比我大大不如。呢种刺客，似乎专学飞檐走壁之术，格斗嘅训练却係不足。我喺黑暗中略佔上风，渐渐将佢迫出屋外。

26:

27:「哼，大胆狂徒，你係边个！点解要暗算老夫！」

28:

29:「你做咁多伤天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」听黑衣人嘅声音，竟然似係女人。难怪我同佢对打可以力拔山河。平时我边有咁大力？佢口里强硬，却一个翻身跳出墙外，似乎想逃走。

30:

31:![image]

32:

33:我提剑急追，佢见我迫近，回身一剑，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一声，宝剑乱挥，斩中佢手腕。佢大叫一声翻倒在地上，长剑亦 clang! 一声跌咗落地下。

34:

35:此时大雨已经停止，乌云渐散。月光下见到黑衣人喺泥地上不断挣扎，却已经无力起身再战。黑衣人嘅脸相有点似曾相识，我再望返佢把剑，大吃一惊。咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天剑？！

36:

37:呢把剑係当年党主席赐我嘅礼物，剑身刻有「HARRRR～！！！」嘅洋文，极霸气。自从熔癌之役之后，我就冇见过呢把剑，点解会重现人间呢？

38:

39:「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 我抑压心抵嘅震惊，若无其事咁问。

40:

41:「！！！」 黑衣人惊訖嘅眼神已经回答咗我。佢点都估唔到我认得呢把剑。原来係熔癌派人追杀我。断估係佢唔抵得我投靠朝庭咁多年都死唔去，派人嚟送我一程。

42:

43:我望住呢个嚟刺杀我嘅黑衣女人，定睛细看，确定咗我心底嘅疑惑之后，缓慢咁讲：

44:

45:

46:「阿呆，哎暗若饿花打。」

47:

48:「？？？」 佢一臉迷惘，我忽然醒起熔癌唔识英文。

49:「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」

50:

51:【完】

Wait, the line numbers might have been misaligned in the user's input. Let me check again. The user's input shows lines from 1 to 52, but the actual content may have line breaks. For example, line 1 is "# 呆總嘅老豆", then lines 2,3 are empty. Line4 is 「轟隆！」. Then line5 is empty, line6 is the narrative, etc.

But when considering each line as per the input, including empty lines, each line is numbered. So line 1 is "# 呆總嘅老豆", line2 is empty, line3 is empty, line4 is 「轟隆！」, etc.

Now, the task is to check each line (even empty ones) to see if they contain dialogue or spoken text. The key is to look for lines that have speech elements, such as text within quotation marks (like 「...」), or words indicating speech (like 'said', 'exclaimed', etc.), or lines where characters are directly speaking.

So, let's go through each line:

Line 1: "# 呆總嘅老豆" — This is a comment or title, no dialogue. Exclude.

Line2: empty. Exclude.

Line3: empty. Exclude.

Line4: 「轟隆！」 — Yes, dialogue. Include.

Line5: empty. Exclude.

Line6: "平靜嘅夜空，竟然响起乾雷。" — Narrative. Exclude.

Line7: empty. Exclude.

Line8: 「啊～！」老夫同汉昭烈帝一样係盖世英雄，立即虎口剧震，筷子连同夹紧嘅叉烧一齐跌咗落地。「⋯⋯吓死老夫喇。」 — This line has two sections of dialogue. The first part is 「啊～！」 followed by narrative, then another quoted part. But the entire line is a mix of action and dialogue. However, the presence of the quoted speech makes this line include dialogue. So include line8.

Line9: "我望住屋外天色，月光一早被黑云淹没，湿气极重。钦天监今次仲唔挂黑色暴雨警告的话，听朝睇怕会有十万人上书皇上，叫佢炒咗嗰班粉肠。" — This is narrative. Exclude.

Line10: ... — Narrative. Exclude.

Line11: 「轰隆！」 呢次雷声，果然带来倾盆大雨，屋外屋顶雨声不绝。 — The first part is quoted dialogue, so line11 includes dialogue. Include.

Line12: "我喺呢间屋已经孤独度过十八个寒暑，屋顶落雨嘅滴嗒声每一个细节，一早了然于胸。我正打算弯低身执返嚿叉烧嗰阵，忽然觉得唔对路。" — Narrative. Exclude.

Line13: ... — Narrative. Exclude.

Line14: ... — Narrative. Exclude.

Line15: ... — Narrative. Exclude.

Line16: empty. Exclude.

Line17: ![image] — Image. Exclude.

Line18: empty. Exclude.

Line19: "屋顶 ⋯⋯ 多咗一个人。" — Narrative. Exclude.

Line20: empty. Exclude.

Line21: "我手握剑柄，六神归一，留心倾听。果然有人喺屋顶跳落后庭院！轻盈嘅脚步声极之细微，来者显然学过轻功。如果唔係忽然落大雨，敌人嘅突袭可能已经得手。" — Action description. Exclude.

Line22: ... — Action. Exclude.

Line23: "脚步声越近，我腰间宝剑出鞘嘅一刻，厅门已经「嘭！」一声被踢爆。" — The 「嘭！」 is in quotes, so dialogue. Include line23.

Line24: ... — Action. Exclude.

Line25: ... — Action. Exclude.

Line26: ... — Action. Exclude.

Line27: 「哼，大胆狂徒，你係边个！点解要暗算老夫！」 — Dialogue. Include.

Line28: ... — Action. Exclude.

Line29: 「你做咁多伤天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」 — Dialogue. Include.

Line30: ... — Image. Exclude.

Line31: empty. Exclude.

Line32: ... — Narrative. Exclude.

Line33: ... — Action. Exclude.

Line34: ... — Action. Exclude.

Line35: ... — Thought. Exclude.

Line36: ... — Narrative. Exclude.

Line37: ... — Narrative. Exclude.

Line38: empty. Exclude.

Line39: 「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 我抑压心抵嘅震惊，若无其事咁问。 — The first part is dialogue. Include line39.

Line40: ... — Narrative. Exclude.

Line41: 「！！！」 黑衣人惊訖嘅眼神已经回答咗我。 ... — The 「！！！」 is an exclamation, possibly part of dialogue. But the rest is narrative. However, the presence of the exclamation mark in quotes might indicate dialogue. But in this case, the line starts with 「！！！」 followed by explanation. Maybe it's the character's reaction. But the exclamation is part of the dialogue. So line41 includes dialogue. Wait, the line is: "41:「！！！」 黑衣人惊訖嘅眼神已经回答咗我。佢点都估唔到我认得呢把剑。原来係熔癌派人追杀我。断估係佢唔抵得我投靠朝庭咁多年都死唔去，派人嚟送我一程。" The first part is in quotes, so that's dialogue. So line41 includes dialogue. Include.

Line42: empty. Exclude.

Line43: "我望住呢个嚟刺杀我嘅黑衣女人，定睛细看，确定咗我心底嘅疑惑之后，缓慢咁讲：" — The word "讲" indicates speaking. The line ends with a quote mark, but the actual dialogue is in the next line. Wait, line43 is: "43:我望住呢个嚟刺杀我嘅黑衣女人，定睛细看，确定咗我心底嘅疑惑之后，缓慢咁讲：" — So the character is about to speak, and the dialogue is in line44. But line43 itself does not contain the dialogue, only the instruction to speak. So line43 may not contain dialogue. However, sometimes in Chinese writing, the line may end with a quote mark. Let me check the actual content. Line43 is: "43:我望住呢个嚟刺杀我嘅黑衣女人，定睛细看，确定咗我心底嘅疑惑之后，缓慢咁讲：" — The line ends with a quote mark, but the dialogue starts in line44: "44:「阿呆，哎暗若饿花打。」" So line43 is the character saying something, but the dialogue is in line44. Therefore, line43 does not contain the spoken text itself. So exclude line43.

Line44: 「阿呆，哎暗若饿花打。」 — Dialogue. Include.

Line45: empty. Exclude.

Line46: 「？？？」 佢一臉迷惘，我忽然醒起熔癌唔识英文。 — The first part is dialogue (the exclamation marks), but the rest is narrative. However, the quoted 「？？？」 is dialogue. Include line46.

Line47: ... — Narrative. Exclude.

Line48: 「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」 — Dialogue. Include.

Line49: ... — Narrative. Exclude.

Line50: empty. Exclude.

Line51: 【完】 — This is a common Chinese marker for the end of a chapter or story. Exclude.

Line52: ... — Not present in the user's input. The user's input ends at line51.

Wait, the user's input ends with line51: 【完】. So line51 is that. So lines up to 51.

So compiling all the lines that contain dialogue:

4: 「轟隆！」 — yes.

8: ... includes dialogue.

11: 「轰隆！」 — yes.

23: 「嘭！」 — yes.

27: dialogue.

29: dialogue.

39: dialogue.

41: dialogue (the 「！！！」).

44: dialogue.

46: dialogue (the 「？？？」).

48: dialogue.

Wait, line41: 「！！！」 is part of the dialogue. So line41 includes dialogue.

But wait, line41's content is: "41:「！！！」 黑衣人惊訖嘅眼神已经回答咗我。佢点都估唔到我认得呢把剑。原来係熔癌派人追杀我。断估係佢唔抵得我投靠朝庭咁多年都死唔去，派人嚟送我一程。" The first part is in quotes, so that's dialogue. So line41 is included.

Similarly, line44 is 「阿呆，哎暗若饿花打。」 — included.

So the lines to include are:

4,8,11,23,27,29,39,41,44,46,48.

Wait, let's verify each line:

Line4: yes.

Line8: yes.

Line11: yes.

Line23: yes.

Line27: yes.

Line29: yes.

Line39: yes.

Line41: yes.

Line44: yes.

Line46: yes.

Line48: yes.

Are there any others?

Line50: empty.

Line51: 【完】.

What about line34? Line34 is: "34:此时大雨已经停止，乌云渐散。月光下见到黑衣人喺泥地上不断挣扎，却已经无力起身再战。黑衣人嘅脸相有点似曾相识，我再望返佢把剑，大吃一惊。咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天剑？！" The word "咦!" is an exclamation, but is it in quotes? In the line, it's written as "咦！" which may be part of the narrative. If it's written without quotes, it's part of the character's thought, not dialogue. So line34 does not contain dialogue.

Similarly, line37: "37:呢把剑係当年党主席赐我嘅礼物，剑身刻有「HARRRR～！！！」嘅洋文，极霸气。自从熔癌之役之后，我就冇见过呢把剑，点解会重现人间呢？" The quotes around the洋文 are part of the description of the sword, not dialogue. So line37 is narrative.

So the lines that should be included are:

4,8,11,23,27,29,39,41,44,46,48.

Wait, line41's content is: "41:「！！！」 黑衣人惊訖嘅眼神已经回答咗我。 ..." The 「！！！」 is in quotes, so that's dialogue. So line41 is included.

Now, let's list each line number and the line content:

4: 「轟隆！」 — yes.

8: line8 has dialogue.

11: line11 has dialogue.

23: line23 has dialogue.

27: line27 has dialogue.

29: line29 has dialogue.

39: line39 has dialogue.

41: line41 has dialogue.

44: line44 has dialogue.

46: line46 has dialogue.

48: line48 has dialogue.

Wait, line46 is: "46:「阿呆，哎暗若饿花打。」" — yes.

So the lines are:

4,8,11,23,27,29,39,41,44,46,48.

Wait, line44 is line44: "44:「阿呆，哎暗若饿花打。」" — yes.

Now, let's check each of these lines:

Line4: yes.

Line8: yes.

Line11: yes.

Line23: yes.

Line27: yes.

Line29: yes.

Line39: yes.

Line41: yes.

Line44: yes.

Line46: yes.

Line48: yes.

So that's 11 lines.

Now, the task is to output each line along with its line number, and a --- after each line.

But wait, the user's input may have line numbers that are not consecutive. For example, in the user's input, after line3 comes line4, then line5 is empty, line6 is the narrative, etc. So each line in the input is numbered from 1 to 52, even if empty.

So when processing, we need to take the input as given, with each line (including empty ones) numbered, and check each line for dialogue.

So let's go through each line from 1 to 52:

1: "# 呆總嘅老豆" — no.

2: empty — no.

3: empty — no.

4: 「轟隆！」 — yes.

5: empty — no.

6: "平靜嘅夜空，竟然响起乾雷。" — no.

7: empty — no.

8: 「啊～！」老夫同汉昭烈帝一样係盖世英雄，立即虎口剧震，筷子连同夹紧嘅叉烧一齐跌咗落地。「⋯⋯吓死老夫喇。」 — yes.

9: ... — no.

10: ... — no.

11: 「轰隆！」 呢次雷声，果然带来倾盆大雨，屋外屋顶雨声不绝。 — yes.

12: ... — no.

13: ... — no.

14: ... — no.

15: ... — no.

16: empty — no.

17: ![image] — no.

18: empty — no.

19: ... — no.

20: empty — no.

21: ... — no.

22: ... — no.

23: "脚步声越近，我腰间宝剑出鞘嘅一刻，厅门已经「嘭！」一声被踢爆。" — yes.

24: ... — no.

25: ... — no.

26: ... — no.

27: 「哼，大胆狂徒，你係边个！点解要暗算老夫！」 — yes.

28: ... — no.

29: 「你做咁多伤天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」 — yes.

30: ... — no.

31: empty — no.

32: ... — no.

33: ... — no.

34: ... — no.

35: ... — no.

36: ... — no.

37: ... — no.

38: empty — no.

39: 「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 我抑压心抵嘅震惊，若无其事咁问。 — yes.

40: ... — no.

41: 「！！！」 黑衣人惊訖嘅眼神已经回答咗我。 ... — yes.

42: empty — no.

43: ... — no.

44: 「阿呆，哎暗若饿花打。」 — yes.

45: empty — no.

46: 「？？？」 佢一臉迷惘，我忽然醒起熔癌唔识英文。 — yes.

47: ... — no.

48: 「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」 — yes.

49: ... — no.

50: empty — no.

51: 【完】 — no.

So the lines to include are:

4,8,11,23,27,29,39,41,44,46,48.

Now, let's verify each of these lines:

Line4: 「轟隆！」 — yes.

Line8: includes dialogue.

Line11: includes dialogue.

Line23: includes dialogue.

Line27: includes dialogue.

Line29: includes dialogue.

Line39: includes dialogue.

Line41: includes dialogue.

Line44: includes dialogue.

Line46: includes dialogue.

Line48: includes dialogue.

Yes.

Now, output each of these lines with their line numbers, followed by a --- after each line.

So the output would be:

4: 「轟隆！」---

8: 「啊～！」老夫同汉昭烈帝一样係盖世英雄，立即虎口剧震，筷子连同夹紧嘅叉烧一齐跌咗落地。「⋯⋯吓死老夫喇。」---

11: 「轰隆！」 呢次雷声，果然带来倾盆大雨，屋外屋顶雨声不绝。---

23: 脚步声越近，我腰间宝剑出鞘嘅一刻，厅门已经「嘭！」一声被踢爆。---

27: 「哼，大胆狂徒，你係边个！点解要暗算老夫！」---

29: 「你做咁多伤天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」---

39: 「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 我抑压心抵嘅震惊，若无其事咁问。---

41: 「！！！」 黑衣人惊訖嘅眼神已经回答咗我。佢点都估唔到我认得呢把剑。原来係熔癌派人追杀我。断估係佢唔抵得我投靠朝庭咁多年都死唔去，派人嚟送我一程。---

44: 「阿呆，哎暗若饿花打。」---

46: 「？？？」 佢一臉迷惘，我忽然醒起熔癌唔识英文。---

48: 「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」---

Wait, but line41's content is longer. Let me check the actual line41 in the input. The user's input shows line41 as:

41:「！！！」 黑衣人惊訖嘅眼神已经回答咗我。佢点都估唔到我认得呢把剑。原来係熔癌派人追杀我。断估係佢唔抵得我投靠朝庭咁多年都死唔去，派人嚟送我一程。

So the entire line starts with 「！！！」 followed by narrative. But the presence of the quoted exclamation marks makes it part of dialogue. So line41 is included.

Similarly, line44 is exactly the quoted dialogue.

Now, the output should list each line with its number and the line content, followed by a ---.

But wait, the user's input may have line numbers that are not consecutive. For example, after line3 is line4, then line5 is empty, line6 is the narrative. So the line numbers are as per the input.

So the correct output would be:

4: 「轟隆！」---

8: 「啊～！」老夫同汉昭烈帝一样係盖世英雄，立即虎口剧震，筷子连同夹紧嘅叉烧一齐跌咗落地。「⋯⋯吓死老夫喇。」---

11: 「轰隆！」 呢次雷声，果然带来倾盆大雨，屋外屋顶雨声不绝。---

23: 脚步声越近，我腰间宝剑出鞘嘅一刻，厅门已经「嘭！」一声被踢爆。---

27: 「哼，大胆狂徒，你係边个！点解要暗算老夫！」---

29: 「你做咁多伤天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」---

39: 「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 我抑压心抵嘅震惊，若无其事咁问。---

41: 「！！！」 黑衣人惊訖嘅眼神已经回答咗我。佢点都估唔到我认得呢把剑。原来係熔癌
