What a fascinating challenge! Here's a list of World of Warcraft (vanilla only) locations, one for each letter of the alphabet, starting with "A for Azeroth":

1. **A** - Azeroth (the continent, as you've started)
2. **B** - Booty Bay (a pirate-themed town in Stranglethorn Vale)
3. **C** - Capital City (could refer to either Stormwind City or Orgrimmar, but for uniqueness, let's go with) **Capital of the Gnomes**: **C** - **Coldridge Valley** (near Dun Morogh, a key gnomish area)
   - **Revised for Clarity**: **C** - **Coldridge Valley**
4. **D** - Darnassus (the night elf capital)
5. **E** - Eversong Woods (a blood elf zone in Quel'Thalas, though more accurately part of the original game's lore through the Sunwell Plateau's introduction in late vanilla, for the sake of the challenge, we'll keep it as it fits well)
   - **Revised for Pure Vanilla Accuracy**: **E** - **Eagle's Rest** (a location in the Wetlands)
6. **F** - Felwood (a corrupted forest in Kalimdor)
7. **G** - Gnomeregan (the ruined gnomish city)
8. **H** - Hillsbrad Foothills (a zone in the Eastern Kingdoms)
9. **I** - Ironforge (the dwarven capital)
10. **J** - **Revised for Accuracy**: Initially, there wasn't a perfect "J" location in pure vanilla lore that's widely recognized. For the sake of the challenge and to adhere strictly to vanilla, let's adjust to a more fitting approach for challenging letters: **J** - **Jungle of Stranglethorn Vale** (emphasizing the jungle part of the zone)
11. **K** - Kalimdor (one of the two main continents)
12. **L** - Loch Modan (a lake in Dun Morogh, significant for dwarven lore)
13. **M** - Moonglade (a night elf sanctuary in Ashenvale)
14. **N** - Northrend (mentioned in vanilla, though fully explored in Wrath of the Lich King, for the challenge's sake and its vanilla presence in lore)
    - **Revised for Pure Vanilla Location**: **N** - **Nagrand** (mentioned in quests and lore, but not fully explored until later; to keep it vanilla-location focused) **Revised Again for Accuracy**: **N** - **Nefarian's Lair** (within Blackrock Spire, a key vanilla raid location)
15. **O** - Orgrimmar (the orcish capital)
16. **P** - Plaguelands (specifically, the Eastern Plaguelands, a significant zone)
17. **Q** - **Challenging Letter**: For vanilla accuracy and a location, **Q** - **Quel'Thalas** (the blood elf kingdom, referenced in vanilla)
18. **R** - Ratchet (a neutral port town in the Barrens)
19. **S** - Stormwind City (the human capital)
20. **T** - Tanaris (a desert zone in Kalimdor)
21. **U** - **Challenging**: For a more accurate and less forced fit, **U** - **Uldaman** (an ancient dwarven ruin, a dungeon in vanilla WoW)
22. **V** - **Vanilla Challenge**: **V** - **Vale of Eternal Blossoms** doesn't fit (Pandaria, from Mists of Pandaria). A better, though less direct, fit for vanilla could be emphasizing a location starting with "V" in quests or lore, but accurately, **V** - **Violet Hold** (in Duskwood, a dungeon)
23. **W** - Winterspring (a zone in Kalimdor, home of the night elves)
24. **X** - **Extremely Challenging**: Given the lack of direct "X" locations, a creative approach might be needed, but for accuracy and the challenge's spirit, acknowledging the stretch: **X** - **Xandros' Lair** (a part of the Deadmines, a reference to a character/location within a dungeon)
25. **Y** - **Yellow Hills** (in the Alterac Mountains, though not a major zone, it fits the challenge better than most "Y" options)
26. **Z** - **Zul'Gurub** (a dungeon in Stranglethorn Vale, focusing on the "Z" in the name for the challenge)

**Revised List for Enhanced Accuracy and Clarity on Vanilla Locations Only:**

1. **A** - Azeroth
2. **B** - Booty Bay
3. **C** - Coldridge Valley
4. **D** - Darnassus
5. **E** - Eagle's Rest
6. **F** - Felwood
7. **G** - Gnomeregan
8. **H** - Hillsbrad Foothills
9. **I** - Ironforge
10. **J** - Jungle of Stranglethorn Vale
11. **K** - Kalimdor
12. **L** - Loch Modan
13. **M** - Moonglade
14. **N** - Nefarian's Lair
15. **O** - Orgrimmar
16. **P** - Plaguelands
17. **Q** - Quel'Thalas
18. **R** - Ratchet
19. **S** - Stormwind City
20. **T** - Tanaris
21. **U** - Uldaman
22. **V** - Violet Hold
23. **W** - Winterspring
24. **X** - Xandros' Lair (within The Deadmines)
25. **Y** - Yellow Hills
26. **Z** - Zul'Gurub

**Note**: Letters like "J", "Q", "X", and to some extent "U" and "Y", are challenging due to the nature of WoW's location naming conventions in vanilla. The choices for these letters are the best fits given the constraints, with a focus on revising for pure vanilla accuracy where initially stretched. [end of text]
