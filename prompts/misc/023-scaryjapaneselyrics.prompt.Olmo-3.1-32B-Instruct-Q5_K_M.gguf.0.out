Certainly! Let’s break down the story told by these whimsical lyrics, focusing on both the fantastical and the literal possibilities within a fantastical setting.

### **Literal/Fantastical Interpretation**

The song paints the picture of a mysterious, almost magical little restaurant hidden deep in a forest. The narrator is searching for this place, following a trail (ドングリを辿っても着きません / "Even following the trail, I can't reach it"), suggesting it's elusive or only accessible under certain conditions or to certain people.

The restaurant is described as "small," with an empty pocket (空っぽのポケットを弄って / "fiddling with an empty pocket"), hinting perhaps that the narrator is missing something—maybe a ticket, a key, or even a memory of the person they're trying to meet (忘れた人から辿り着く / "I'll find my way by following the forgotten person").

There are no reservations, and the lunchtime is empty except for chirping birds (空席だらけのランチ時 / "All seats empty at lunchtime," and "small birds are chirping patapata"). This gives the place a lonely, timeless, or otherworldly atmosphere.

The building itself is vividly described: a bright pink (真っ赤なペンキ) roof, and from the kitchen, the sounds of classical instruments (バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ / "violin, flute, cello, viola") drift out, as if the kitchen is run by magical creatures or perhaps the kitchen itself is alive with music.

The staff (or perhaps the restaurant itself) welcomes guests warmly (ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい / "Welcome, welcome"), but with a warning: if you eat the tarofuku (a traditional Japanese packed meal), you'll fall asleep (たらふく食べたらお眠りよ / "If you eat tarofuku, you'll sleep"). This suggests the food has magical or soporific properties.

The song then says goodbye to the guests, promising "see you tomorrow" (明日は明日で / "it's tomorrow for tomorrow"), implying the restaurant may only be open at certain times or in a dreamlike state.

The verses about dancing from right to left, a bear cub joining in, and the mention of dishes like "カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル" (karupaccho, paella, au naturel) suggest a lively, almost surreal banquet or party that unfolds in the restaurant, where animals and humans mingle. There is no dessert (リゾット デザートはありません / "There is no dessert"), but the journey extends "even to the grave" (お墓の中まで届けましょう / "Let's reach even to the grave"), hinting at a final, all-encompassing feast or perhaps a journey through life and beyond.

The closing lines suggest this is the "last full course" (最後のフルコース / "the last full course") for tonight, giving the sense that this magical restaurant is a fleeting, once-in-a-lifetime experience.

### **Story Summary (Fantastical, Literal Sense)**

The song tells the story of a magical, hidden forest restaurant that only appears to those who are lost, forgotten, or seeking something just out of reach. It is a place where time stands still, where music and magic fill the air, and where the food has the power to lull you into a deep sleep—perhaps as a way to transport you to another realm or to help you forget your worries.

Animals and humans dance together in this enchanted space, and the restaurant's doors are open only for special occasions or to those who truly need its comfort. The journey through the restaurant's courses is a metaphor for a journey through life, dreams, or even the afterlife, ending with the promise that tonight's experience is the last for now, but will return "tomorrow."

In a literal, fantastical sense, the restaurant is a liminal space—a magical gathering place for the lost and the dreaming, where the boundaries between the living, the forgotten, and the magical blur together in a celebration of food, music, and memory.
