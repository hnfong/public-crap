A) **No**, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. At -12 degrees Celsius, water remains in its liquid state.

B) If you cool pure water to -12 degrees Celsius, it will remain liquid. However, the water will start to form ice crystals at the surface and at nucleation sites (tiny imperfections in the water, such as dust particles or scratches on the glass). This process is called **supercooling**. The water is metastable at -12 degrees Celsius and will eventually freeze if disturbed, such as by adding a seed crystal or shaking the glass.
