A) **No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius.**  
Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. At -12 degrees Celsius, water remains in a liquid state, though it may begin to form ice crystals if the temperature is lowered further or if there are impurities in the water.

B) **If pure water is cooled to -12 degrees Celsius, it will remain liquid.**  
At -12 degrees Celsius, water is still below its freezing point but above the temperature at which ice sublimes (turns directly from solid to gas). Therefore, the water will remain in a liquid state unless additional conditions, such as supercooling or the presence of impurities, are introduced.
