👑🏼‍♀️Snow White👰🏼‍♀️, a beautiful princess, lived in a grand castle with her stepmother, the wicked Queen👑🏼‍♀️. The Queen was jealous of Snow White's beauty and tried to kill her by poisoning her apple at her birthday party. But a friendly bird🐦 helped Snow White by saving her from the poisoned apple and taking her away to a safe place.

Snow White found refuge in a cozy cottage in the woods, where she met seven friendly dwarfs🧔👨‍🦯‍♀️. They welcomed her with open arms and offered her a place to stay. Snow White became friends with the dwarfs and helped them around the cottage.

One day, the Queen heard that Snow White was still alive and decided to go to the cottage herself, disguised as an old woman🧓🏼‍♀️. She tricked Snow White into biting into another poisoned apple, and she fell unconscious.

Luckily, the dwarfs found Snow White and saved her once again. They placed her in a glass coffin📦 and kept watch over her until a prince🚣‍♂️ came along and fell in love with her. He woke her with a kiss, and they lived happily ever after in the castle.
