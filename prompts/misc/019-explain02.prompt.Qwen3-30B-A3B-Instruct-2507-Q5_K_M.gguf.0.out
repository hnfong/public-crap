Okay! Imagine you have a big group of grown-ups who help make rules for your school, like when you can play outside or what snacks are allowed. Now, instead of a school, think of a whole country—China!

The National People's Congress (that’s a big name, so let’s call it “NPC” for short) is like the biggest group of grown-ups in China who make the most important rules for the whole country. They decide things like how money is spent, what laws are needed, and even how the country is run.

It’s kind of like if all the teachers, parents, and school leaders in London came together to decide what’s best for the whole city—like building new parks, making sure everyone can go to school, or keeping the streets safe.

The NPC meets once a year, and the people in it are chosen by the people of China. They talk, listen, and then vote on big decisions.

So, just like how your school has rules to help everyone be happy and safe, the NPC helps make rules so that everyone in China can live well and happily too! 🌏✨ [end of text]
