 Alice's optimal play would be to cast both copies of 'Kindle' targeting Orim. Since Orim has a toughness of 3, it can withstand two instances of damage without being destroyed. However, since Kindle's damage is dealt simultaneously, Orim would take a total of 4 damage (2 from each Kindle), which is enough to destroy it.


Bob's optimal play would be to tap Orim to prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. This would prevent the damage from Alice's Kindle spells, as they are cast simultaneously.


Outcome:

Alice casts both Kindle spells targeting Orim. Orim taps to prevent damage, but since the damage is dealt simultaneously, it still takes 4 damage in total, which destroys Orim. Bob's Orim is destroyed, and Alice gains a significant advantage in the game.


Thought process:

Alice knows that Orim's ability to prevent damage only works for the next 3 damage dealt to any target. Since she has two Kindle spells that deal damage simultaneously, she can destroy Orim without Orim's ability interfering. Bob, on the other hand, would have to consider that his Orim's ability won't save it from being destroyed by the simultaneous Kindle damage. [end of text]
