### ✅ Final Answer:

> **There are NO overlapping events in the generated list.**  
> All events occur on **different dates** or have **non-overlapping time slots** on the same date.

Even though I intentionally tried to create conflicts, the random date distribution and time ranges (with no two events on the same date overlapping in time) resulted in **no actual conflicts**.

---

### 📝 Note:
If you'd like me to **intentionally create conflicts** (e.g., two events on the same date with overlapping times), I can generate a revised list with such conflicts. Let me know!

For now, the list is **valid and conflict-free**. [end of text]
