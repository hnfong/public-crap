**A) Yes, water freezes at -12°C.**
Under standard atmospheric pressure, the freezing point of water is 0°C. Since -12°C is significantly below this threshold, water will be in a solid state (ice) at this temperature.

**B) It will likely freeze, but it might remain liquid temporarily due to supercooling.**
If the water is very pure and undisturbed, it can sometimes be cooled below 0°C without turning into ice, a phenomenon known as **supercooling**. In this state, the water remains liquid at -12°C until a disturbance (like shaking or adding an impurity) triggers rapid crystallization. However, if the water contains impurities or is disturbed, it will freeze solid at 0°C and remain frozen at -12°C. [end of text]
