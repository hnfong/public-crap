<s> <用户>If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

<AI> When discussing the terms "consistent" and "automatically logical," it's important to clarify that these terms refer to different aspects of a theoretical framework.

A consistent theory is one that cannot be contradicted by its own axioms or logic. In other words, a consistent theory is one where its own premises do not lead to self-contradiction. However, a theory can still be consistent even if it is not automatically logical. This means that the theory is true, but it does not follow from its own axioms in a way that is straightforward or immediately apparent.

On the other hand, a theory that is automatically logical means that the premises of the theory are self-evident and do not lead to contradictory statements. In other words, a theory is automatically logical if the premises of the theory are true, and the conclusion of the theory follows from the premises without any ambiguity or uncertainty.

One example of a consistent theory is set theory, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of sets and their properties. Set theory is consistent because it cannot be contradicted by its own axioms. However, set theory is not automatically logical. For example, the statement "For all sets S, if S is a subset of a set T, then S is a proper subset of T" is a valid statement in set theory, but it does not follow from the axioms of set theory in a way that is immediately apparent.

An example of an automatically logical theory is the theory of natural numbers. The axioms of natural numbers are "for all natural numbers n, n + 1 is natural" and "for all natural numbers n, there is a natural number n + 1 that is greater than n." These axioms are self-evident and do not lead to contradictory statements. Therefore, the theory of natural numbers is automatically logical.

In conclusion, while consistent and automatically logical are both useful terms to describe the properties of a theoretical framework, they refer to different aspects. A consistent theory cannot be contradicted by its own axioms or logic, but a theory can still be consistent even if it is not automatically logical. An automatically logical theory, on the other hand, is true because its premises are self-evident and do not lead to contradictory statements. The axioms of the theory must be self-evident and do not lead to contradictory statements in order for the theory to be automatically logical.</s>
