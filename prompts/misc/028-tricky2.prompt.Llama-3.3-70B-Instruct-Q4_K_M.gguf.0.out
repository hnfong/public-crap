Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is incorrect. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, not -10 degrees Celsius. At -10 degrees Celsius, water is already frozen, but it doesn't freeze at that temperature. Alice is correct. [end of text]
