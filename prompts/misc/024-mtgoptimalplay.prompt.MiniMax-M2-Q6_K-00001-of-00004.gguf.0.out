### The situation

- Alice has two copies of Kindle in hand.
- Kindle is an instant: “Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards.”
- Bob controls Orim, Samite Healer (1/3), untapped. Orim has the ability: “Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.”
- It is Alice’s turn. She has enough mana to cast any spells. Bob’s lands are tapped out (so he cannot tap lands to pay costs this turn).
- Orim has been on the battlefield long enough (no summoning sickness).

### The question

What is the optimal play for both players, and what is the outcome?

---

## The optimal play

### Alice’s optimal play

Alice should **cast both copies of Kindle in sequence, targeting Orim**.

- First Kindle: X = 2 + (number of Kindles in all graveyards). At this moment, there are 0 Kindles in any graveyard, so X = 2. Orim takes 2 damage.
- Second Kindle: Now there is 1 Kindle in a graveyard (the one just cast), so X = 2 + 1 = 3. Orim takes 3 more damage.

Total damage to Orim: 2 + 3 = 5. Orim has 3 toughness, so it dies.

### Bob’s optimal response

Bob has only one relevant action: he can tap Orim to prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. However, because Alice is casting two spells, Bob must decide when to use Orim’s ability.

- If Bob uses Orim’s ability **after the first Kindle resolves**, it will prevent the next 3 damage. The second Kindle would deal 3 damage, but that damage would be prevented. Orim would take 2 damage from the first Kindle and 0 from the second, for a total of 2 damage. Orim survives (1 toughness remaining).
- If Bob does **not** use Orim’s ability at all, then both Kindles resolve and deal 5 damage, killing Orim.

Therefore, Bob’s optimal response is to **tap Orim after the first Kindle resolves** to prevent the damage from the second Kindle. This minimizes the damage to Orim and allows it to survive.

### Outcome

- Alice casts the first Kindle: Orim takes 2 damage (now at 1 toughness).
- Bob taps Orim to prevent the next 3 damage.
- Alice casts the second Kindle: the 3 damage is prevented. Orim takes no damage from the second Kindle.
- Orim survives with 1 toughness.

## Thought process and rules references

### Alice’s perspective

Alice wants to kill Orim. The key is that Kindle’s damage increases with each Kindle in the graveyard. By casting both, she maximizes the damage. However, she must consider Bob’s only response: Orim’s ability.

Alice cannot prevent Bob from using Orim’s ability because it is an activated ability (tap and pay no cost) that can be used at any time. Therefore, Alice must assume Bob will use it optimally.

Alice’s best chance is to force Bob to use Orim’s ability on the smaller damage. But note: Orim’s ability prevents the next 3 damage to any target. If Alice casts both Kindles, the first deals 2 and the second deals 3. Bob can only prevent 3 damage total. So if he uses it after the first, he prevents the 3 from the second. If he uses it after the second, he prevents 3 damage but the first 2 still go through. Either way, he can prevent 3 damage.

But wait: what if Alice casts the second Kindle first? Then the first Kindle would deal 3 and the second 2. Bob would still prevent 3 damage. So the order of casting does not matter for the total damage prevented because the ability prevents the next 3 damage regardless of the source.

However, note that the damage from the first Kindle is already dealt by the time Bob can respond. So if Alice casts the first Kindle and it resolves, then Bob can use Orim’s ability to prevent the next 3 damage. Therefore, the damage from the first Kindle is unavoidable.

Alice must then cast the second Kindle. But Bob can prevent that damage. So Alice cannot kill Orim with two Kindles if Bob uses Orim’s ability.

But wait: what if Alice casts both Kindles at the same time? In Magic, you cannot cast two spells simultaneously. You must cast one, then the other. So Bob will always have a chance to use Orim’s ability between the two spells.

Therefore, Alice cannot kill Orim with two Kindles if Bob uses Orim’s ability optimally.

### Bob’s perspective

Bob’s goal is to keep Orim alive. He has only one tool: Orim’s ability. He must use it at the right time.

If he uses it after the first Kindle, he prevents 3 damage. The first Kindle dealt 2, so Orim takes 2 and then the next 3 are prevented. The second Kindle would deal 3, but that is prevented. So Orim takes 2 total.

If he uses it after the second Kindle, then the first Kindle’s 2 damage is not prevented, and the second Kindle’s 3 damage is prevented. Orim takes 2 damage.

But note: if he uses it after the second Kindle, then the first Kindle’s damage was already dealt. So the total damage is 2. If he uses it after the first Kindle, the first Kindle’s damage is dealt and then the next 3 (from the second Kindle) are prevented. So again, total damage is 2.

Therefore, the timing of when Bob uses Orim’s ability does not matter in terms of total damage prevented: he can prevent 3 damage total. The only difference is that if he uses it after the first Kindle, he prevents the damage from the second Kindle. If he uses it after the second Kindle, he prevents the damage from the second Kindle but the first Kindle’s damage was already dealt. So in both cases, Orim takes 2 damage.

But wait: what if Alice casts the second Kindle first? Then the first Kindle cast would be the one that deals 3 (because there is one Kindle in the graveyard from the second Kindle). Then the second Kindle cast would deal 2. Bob can still prevent 3 damage. So if he uses the ability after the first Kindle (which deals 3), then the second Kindle (which deals 2) is prevented. Orim takes 3 damage? But wait, Orim has 3 toughness. If it takes 3 damage, it dies. But Bob can prevent 3 damage. So if he uses the ability after the first Kindle (which deals 3), then the next 3 damage are prevented. The second Kindle deals 2, which is prevented. So Orim takes 0 damage? That can't be right.

Let me clarify:

- If Alice casts the second Kindle first (the one that will deal 3 because there are 0 Kindles in the graveyard at the time of casting), then:
  - Second Kindle resolves: Orim takes 3 damage (now at 0 toughness? But wait, Orim has 3 toughness. So 3 damage would kill it. But then Bob hasn't used Orim's ability yet. So Bob must use it after this? But then the damage is already dealt. So Bob cannot prevent damage that has already been dealt.

Therefore, Bob must use Orim's ability **before** damage is dealt. The ability says "Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So it must be activated before the damage is dealt.

So the sequence must be:

1. Alice casts a Kindle.
2. The Kindle resolves and deals damage. At this point, the damage is dealt and cannot be prevented by an ability activated after the resolution.
3. Bob can then activate Orim's ability to prevent the next 3 damage.

Therefore, if Alice casts the second Kindle first (which deals 3), then that damage is dealt and Orim dies. Then Bob cannot do anything. So Alice would win.

But wait: is that allowed? Let's see:

- Alice casts the second Kindle (which is actually the first one she casts, but we are calling it the second because of the order in her hand). At the time of casting, there are 0 Kindles in the graveyard, so X=2. Wait
