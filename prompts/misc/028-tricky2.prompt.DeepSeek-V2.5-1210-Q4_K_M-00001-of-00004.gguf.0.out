Both Alice and Bob are correct, but they are referring to different contexts. Alice is correct in stating that pure water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm). Bob is also correct because water can freeze at temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius, such as at -10 degrees Celsius, depending on the conditions, such as impurities, pressure, or the presence of solutes that can lower the freezing point.
