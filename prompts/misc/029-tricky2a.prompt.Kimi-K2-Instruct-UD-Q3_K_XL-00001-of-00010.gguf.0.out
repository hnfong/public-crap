Bob is right.  
Pure water normally freezes at 0 °C, but if it is very clean and undisturbed it can be super-cooled below 0 °C without solidifying. At –10 °C such super-cooled liquid water will still freeze (it is thermodynamically unstable), so Bob’s statement “It freezes” is correct even though the equilibrium freezing point is 0 °C.
