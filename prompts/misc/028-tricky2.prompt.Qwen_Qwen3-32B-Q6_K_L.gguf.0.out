Both Alice and Bob are partially right, depending on the context.

- **Alice is correct** in the general case: pure water typically freezes at **0°C (32°F)** under standard atmospheric pressure.

- **Bob is also correct** in a specific context: if the water is **supercooled**, it can remain liquid below 0°C (e.g., -10°C) under very controlled conditions (like being very pure and undisturbed). However, once disturbed or given a nucleation point, it will freeze. So, **water *can* freeze at -10°C**, but it doesn't *have to* at that temperature.

So, **Bob is not wrong**, but **Alice is more correct in the standard case**. [end of text]
