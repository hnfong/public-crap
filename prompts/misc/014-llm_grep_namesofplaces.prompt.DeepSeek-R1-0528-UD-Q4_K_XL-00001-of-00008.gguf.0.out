We are looking for names of countries or regions. We'll go through each line and extract any country or region name that is explicitly mentioned.
 We note that the input has line numbers. We are to output the country/region name and the line number, similar to `grep -n -o`.

 Steps:
 1. We'll split the input by lines and process each line with its given line number.
 2. For each line, we look for words that are country or region names. We have to be cautious: we don't want to trigger on tangential mentions.
 3. We have a list of known countries/regions that appear in the text: 
    From the text we see: Britain, Silesia, France, UK, Portugal, Germany, England, Hamburg, Dantzic, Riga, Holland, France again, England again, France again.
 4. We note that "UK" is an abbreviation for the United Kingdom, which is the same as Britain in this context? But the text uses both "Britain" and "UK". We'll treat them as separate if they appear, but note that in line 4, both "Britain" and "UK" appear. However, the query says "only output the country/region names", so we output each occurrence.

 Important: We must output the country/region name exactly as it appears in the line? And we output for every occurrence? And with the line number.

 However, note: the instruction says "only output the country/region names with line number, something like grep -n -o". So for each occurrence in a line, we output the line number and the matched country/region name.

 But note: the example in the input has multiple countries in one line. For example, line 4: 
   "Take Britain, for example. They allow Silesia lawns to be imported for personal consumption, but prohibit French cambrics and lawns, even if they're meant for export. The UK also imposes higher duties on French wine, while being lenient towards Portugal."

 So in line 4, we have: Britain, Silesia, French (which we can map to France?), UK, French again, Portugal.

 However, note: "French" is an adjective. But in the context, it refers to goods from France. But the query is for "names of countries or regions". So we should only take the proper nouns? 

 Let's see the text: 
   - "Britain" -> country
   - "Silesia" -> region (historical region in Europe, now part of Poland, Czech Republic, and Germany)
   - "French" -> adjective, but note the text also says "France" in the same line? Actually, in line 4, it says "French cambrics" and then "French wine", but also "Portugal". And then "UK".

 However, in line 4, the word "France" does not appear? It says "French". But note: the query is for names. We have to decide: should we consider "French" as a reference to France? 

 But note: the instruction says "only trigger when the input obviously matches the query". So if the line says "French", it is not the name of the country. The country is France. Similarly, we have "Portugal" and "UK".

 So we should only take the explicit country/region names. Therefore, in line 4, we have:
   - Britain
   - Silesia
   - UK
   - Portugal

 But wait, what about "French"? The text says "French cambrics" and "French wine". We are not to extract adjectives. We are to extract the names. So we skip "French".

 However, note that in line 6: "France" appears explicitly: "buy from France, not Portugal or Germany". So we extract "France", "Portugal", "Germany".

 Therefore, for line 4, we extract: Britain, Silesia, UK, Portugal.

 But note: the line also says "The UK" - that's the same as United Kingdom. We output "UK" as it appears.

 Similarly, in line 16: 
   "Imagine if England's merchants often pay for goods from Hamburg, Dantzic, and Riga using bills from Holland."

 We extract: England, Hamburg, Dantzic, Riga, Holland.

 And in line 17: England, Holland, and then England again? Actually, the line says "England" and then "Holland" and then "England" again? Let me check:

   Line 16: England, Hamburg, Dantzic, Riga, Holland.
   Line 17: "For example, before a coin reform in England" -> so England again.

 Also, line 19: France and England.

 We must be cautious: the text also says "Germany" in line 6? Yes.

 So we'll create a list of country/region names that we are going to look for? But note: we don't want to hardcode because the text might have any country. However, we are only to extract when it's obvious.

 We can use a set of known country names that appear in the text? But the instruction is to do it based on the query. We are to extract any country or region name that is explicitly mentioned.

 Approach:
   We can look for words that are known to be country or region names. But without a predefined list, we have to rely on context? 

 However, the instruction says: "only trigger when the input obviously matches the query". So we should only extract if it's unambiguously a country or region.

 We note that the text uses:
   - Britain (line 4)
   - Silesia (line 4) -> region
   - UK (line 4) -> country (abbreviation for United Kingdom)
   - Portugal (line 4 and 6)
   - France (line 6, 19) -> note: in line 4, it's "French", which we skip because it's an adjective.
   - Germany (line 6)
   - England (line 16, 17, 19)
   - Hamburg (line 16) -> city, but also a region? We consider it as a region? The query says "regions" too.
   - Dantzic (line 16) -> historical name for Gdansk, a city in Poland? But we take it as a region.
   - Riga (line 16) -> city in Latvia, region.
   - Holland (line 16, 17) -> region in the Netherlands? But often used to refer to the country.

 So we'll extract all these.

 How to do it without a predefined list? We can use common knowledge? But we are an AI, so we can recognize these.

 However, the instruction says: "Don't explain. Just output as if you're a command line program". So we are expected to have a method.

 We'll do:

   For each line:
      We split the line into words and look for words that are known country/region names? But note: some names have multiple words? (like "United Kingdom") but in the text we have "UK".

   Alternatively, we can use a list of candidate names that we found in the text? But we are to do it for any input. However, the input is fixed.

   Since the input is fixed, we can manually extract:

   Line 4: 
        "Britain" -> found
        "Silesia" -> found
        "UK" -> found
        "Portugal" -> found

   Line 6:
        "France" -> found
        "Portugal" -> found
        "Germany" -> found

   Line 16:
        "England" -> found
        "Hamburg" -> found
        "Dantzic" -> found
        "Riga" -> found
        "Holland" -> found

   Line 17:
        "England" -> found
        "Holland" -> found? Actually, line 17: 
            "For example, before a coin reform in England, ..." -> so England.
            Also, it says "England" again? Actually, the line: 
                "For example, before a coin reform in England, the value of the English currency ..."
            So only one occurrence of "England".

        But then it says: "This means that the real exchange rate might be different from the calculated one." -> no country.

        However, note: the previous line (16) ends with Holland, and then line 17 starts. But we are processing per line.

        Also, in line 17, it says "Holland" again? Let me check the input:

          Line 16: ... from Hamburg, Dantzic, and Riga using bills from Holland.
          Line 17: The way we calculate exchange rates ... in England ...

        So line 17 only has "England".

   Line 19:
        "England" and "France"

   But wait, line 19: 
        "In England, the government covers the cost, but in France, individuals pay a duty of 8% for coinage."

        So we have "England" and "France".

   Also, note line 8: 
        "National biases and prejudices often influence decisions, rather than objective facts." -> no country.

   Line 10: 
        "When the exchange rate between two countries is at par" -> no specific country.

   Line 12: 
        "It's time for countries to rethink" -> no specific country.

   So the lines that have country/region names are: 4, 6, 16, 17, 19.

   However, note: line 4 has multiple occurrences. We are to output each occurrence on a separate line? Like `grep -n -o` would output:

        4:Britain
        4:Silesia
        4:UK
        4:Portugal

   Similarly for others.

   But note: the input has line numbers already provided at the beginning of each line? We are to use the same line numbers.

   The input format:

        1: Let's Talk about Unfair Trade Restrictions
        2: In today's world, ...

   So the line number is the number before the colon.

   We are to output:

        <line number>:<matched country/region name>

   and then "---" after each output.

   However, note: the instruction says "after each line of output", meaning each matched item.

   So for line 4, we output:

        4:Britain
        ---
        4:Silesia
        ---
        4:UK
        ---
        4:Portugal
        ---

   But wait, what about the fact that "UK" is an abbreviation? We output it as it appears.

   Also, note: in line 6, we have:

        6:France
        ---
        6:Portugal
        ---
        6:Germany
        ---

   And line 16:

        16:England
        ---
        16:Hamburg
        ---
        16:Dantzic
        ---
        16:Riga
        ---
        16:Holland
        ---

   Line 17:

        17:England
        ---

   Line 19:

        19:England
        ---
        19:France
        ---

   But note: in line 19, it says "English" coins? We skip because it's an adjective.

   However, we must be cautious: the word "English" is an adjective and does not denote the country name. We only want the noun form? So we skip.

   Therefore, we output:

        Line 4: Britain, Silesia, UK, Portugal
        Line 6: France, Portugal, Germany
        Line 16: England, Hamburg, Dantzic, Riga, Holland
        Line 17: England
        Line 19: England, France

   But note: in line 4, the word "Britain" and "UK" are both present. We output both.

   However, what about "Silesia"? It's a region. We output it.

   Now, let's code this logic? But we are not coding, we are simulating.

   We'll write the output accordingly.

   Important: if a line has no country, we skip.

   We must not output anything for lines without.

   Let's write the output:

        4:Britain
        ---
        4:Silesia
        ---
        4:UK
        ---
        4:Portugal
        ---
        6:France
        ---
        6:Portugal
        ---
        6:Germany
        ---
        16:England
        ---
        16:Hamburg
        ---
        16:Dantzic
        ---
        16:Riga
        ---
        16:Holland
        ---
        17:England
        ---
        19:England
        ---
        19:France
        ---

   But note: in line 6, the text says "Portugal" again? Actually, it says "Portugal or Germany". So we have one occurrence of Portugal and one of Germany.

   Also, note: line 16 has "England" at the beginning: "England's merchants" -> possessive, but we still extract "England".

   However, what about "Holland" in line 16? It's "bills from Holland", so we extract.

   We are done.

   But note: the input has line 15: "[Show original]" -> no country.

   And line 18 is empty.

   So we output only the above.

   However, note: the instruction says "If no lines match just give empty response." and we have matches.

   We output accordingly.

   One more: in line 4, the word "French" appears twice? But we skip because it's an adjective. We only want the noun form of the country.

   Similarly, in line 17, "English" is an adjective -> skip.

   Therefore, the output is as above.

   Let me double-check the input:

        Line 4: "Take Britain, ... Silesia ... French ... UK ... French ... Portugal"
        -> We skip the two "French", so we have four matches.

        Line 6: "France ... Portugal ... Germany"

        Line 16: "England ... Hamburg ... Dantzic ... Riga ... Holland"

        Line 17: "England"

        Line 19: "England ... France"

   So we output:

        4:Britain
        ---
        4:Silesia
        ---
        4:UK
        ---
        4:Portugal
        ---
        6:France
        ---
        6:Portugal
        ---
        6:Germany
        ---
        16:England
        ---
        16:Hamburg
        ---
        16:Dantzic
        ---
        16:Riga
        ---
        16:Holland
        ---
        17:England
        ---
        19:England
        ---
        19:France
        ---

   We are done.
