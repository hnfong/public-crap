Yo, check the mic, one two, this ain't no drill
It's the Fed, the king, the ultimate power
From the banks to the streets, they're all in the same game
Gotta keep the economy flowing, ain't no time to hide
Got the money flowin', the future's in my hand
So listen up, let the rhythm flow, let the music take hold
