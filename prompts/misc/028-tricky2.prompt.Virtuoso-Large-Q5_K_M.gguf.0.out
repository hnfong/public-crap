Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10 degrees Celsius, water is already in a frozen state, assuming it has had the opportunity to freeze. Bob's statement that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius is incorrect because the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius, not -10 degrees Celsius. 

However, Bob might be trying to imply that water at -10 degrees Celsius is frozen, which is true, but his phrasing is misleading. A more accurate statement would be, "At -10 degrees Celsius, water is frozen." [end of text]
