I have written a fan fiction based on World of Warcraft characters. I saved the file into wowfanfic.txt

What is a probable output if I run this Linux command?

$ cat wowfanfic.txt | perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }' | sort |  uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 20

Explain your answer with respect to basic linguistic principles.

The output of the given command will be a list of the 20 most frequently occurring words in the text of your World of Warcraft fan fiction, along with their frequency counts.

Here's a breakdown of the command and its effects:

1. `cat wowfanfic.txt`: This command reads the contents of the file `wowfanfic.txt` into the standard input.
2. `perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/);`: This Perl one-liner does the following:
	* `-n` tells Perl to enable the default input record separator, which is newline (`\n`).
	* `@a = split(/\s/);` splits the input into an array `@a` using whitespace (`\s`) as the delimiter. This effectively splits the text into individual words.
	* The `-e` option enables the expression to be executed after the command. The expression splits the input into words.
3. `foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }`: This loop iterates over the array `@a` and prints each word followed by a newline character (`\n`).
4. `sort`: This command sorts the output in ascending order.
5. `uniq -c`: This command counts the frequency of each word and outputs the word and its count on separate lines.
6. `sort -n`: This command sorts the output by the count in numerical order.
7. `tail -n 20`: This command outputs the first 20 lines of the output, which correspond to the 20 most frequently occurring words.

The output will be a list of the 20 most common words in the text, along with their frequency counts, like this:

```
word1 10
word2 8
word3 7
...
word20 1
```

This output can be useful for analyzing the linguistic features of the text, such as the most common words, word frequencies, and word lengths. In the context of World of Warcraft fan fiction, this output could help identify the most frequently used words, phrases, or sentence structures, which might be interesting for understanding the writing style and tone of the fan fiction.
