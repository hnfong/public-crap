Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is right. Water freezes at 0°C, but it can also freeze at lower temperatures, including -10°C. This is because the freezing point of water can be lowered by increasing the pressure or by adding impurities. [end of text]
