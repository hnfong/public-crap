 These lyrics seem to describe a whimsical and fantastical experience at a small restaurant in the forest.

The first few lines suggest that the speaker is trying to find the restaurant by following a dung beetle, but they can't seem to reach it. When they finally do arrive, they find that the restaurant has no reservations and is nearly empty during lunchtime. However, there are birds outside that are chirping and laughing.

The restaurant has a red roof and a limited menu that only includes recommended dishes. The speaker can hear various instruments being played in the kitchen, including a violin, flute, cello, and viola.

As the speaker enters the restaurant, they are warmly welcomed and invited to eat until they fall asleep. After saying goodbye to everyone, they are told that tomorrow is another day and that there is always more to come.

The next few lines describe a lively atmosphere as the speaker looks around the restaurant. There are people dancing, including a bear riding on someone's back. The menu includes various Italian dishes like carpaccio, paella, and oyster blade, but there are no desserts.

The speaker then suggests that they should deliver the meal even to those who are buried in the graveyard, implying that the food is so good that it could reach the afterlife. The final line states that tonight is the last full course, suggesting that this is a special and perhaps once-in-a-lifetime experience.

Overall, the lyrics describe a magical and unforgettable meal at a small forest restaurant, where the food, music, and atmosphere create a fantastical and joyful experience. [end of text]
