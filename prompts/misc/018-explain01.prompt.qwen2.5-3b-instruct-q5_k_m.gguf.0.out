Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell,
'bout the Federal Reserve, how they keep the game in check.
They're like the bank that's always on the mic,
keeping the money flowin', making sure it's right.

They're the ones that make sure the money's tight,
when the economy's in a bit of a twist.
They're the ones that keep the interest rates low,
so businesses can grow and not be slow.

They're the ones that make sure the banks are strong,
and the money's flowing, not just a song.
They're the ones that keep the inflation in check,
so the prices don't go up, and we don't get tricked.

They're the ones that make sure the money's fair,
and everyone gets a chance to play the game.
They're the ones that keep the economy steady,
so we can all keep rapin' and not get steered.

So next time you hear about the Fed,
remember, they're the ones that keep the game fed.
They're the ones that make sure the money's right,
so we can all keep rapin' and not get left. [end of text]
