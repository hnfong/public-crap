User: Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.


Assistant: 0 degrees Celsius is the freezing point of water, but the statement from Bob is not necessarily incorrect. If Bob meant that water will freeze at -10 degrees Celsius, then he is correct. Water can freeze at temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius, depending on the conditions and the presence of impurities or other factors. So, if Bob meant that water will freeze at -10 degrees Celsius, then he is right. [end of text]
