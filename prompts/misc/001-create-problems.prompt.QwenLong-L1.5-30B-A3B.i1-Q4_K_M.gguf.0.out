We are creating 8 questions (Q1 to Q8) with the following constraints:

(a) Concise, to the point, within a paragraph or two.
(b) Difficulty increases from Q1 (easy) to Q8 (hard).
(c) Mix of English and Chinese, with a total of 8 questions (so we'll have 4 English and 4 Chinese, or some other mix, but we'll aim for 4 each to be balanced).
(d) Wide range of topics.
(e) Objective assessment: short answers, multiple choice, or very short open form.
(f) Be creative.
(g) For English questions: must contain at least one word with the letter 'z'.
(h) For Chinese questions: must contain the character "平" at least once.
(i) We can provide a suggested answer key after each question.

Let's plan:

We'll have 4 English questions and 4 Chinese questions, alternating to spread the language mix.

We'll assign:
Q1: English (easy)
Q2: Chinese (easy)
Q3: English (medium)
Q4: Chinese (medium)
Q5: English (medium-hard)
Q6: Chinese (medium-hard)
Q7: English (hard)
Q8: Chinese (hard)

But note: the difficulty must gradually increase. So we'll make sure each subsequent question is harder.

Let's brainstorm topics for each:

Q1 (English, easy): A very basic fact. Must have a word with 'z'. Example: "What is the capital of France?" -> but that doesn't have a 'z'. So we need to adjust. How about: "What is the zodiac sign for people born in March?" -> but that's not the easiest. Alternatively, we can use a word that has 'z' in it. Let's think of common words: "pizza", "frozen", "buzz", "quiz", etc.

Idea: "What is the most popular pizza topping in the US?" -> but we need a word with 'z'. The word "pizza" has a 'z'. So that's good.

Q2 (Chinese, easy): Must contain "平". We can ask a simple question about a common word that has "平". For example: "在中文里，'和平'是什么意思？" -> but that has "平" (in "和平"). However, note: the constraint says the question must contain the character "平". So we can write: "请解释'平'在'和平'中的意思。" -> but that's a bit long. Alternatively, we can ask: "中国哪个城市以'平'字开头？" -> but that might be too hard for easy. Let's think of an easy one: "在'平安'这个词中，'平'代表什么？" -> but we want a fact. How about: "请问'平'在'平均'中是什么意思？" -> but that's not a fact. We want a factual question. Let's do: "中国哪个省的简称是'晋'？" -> but that doesn't have "平". We need to include "平". So we can say: "中国哪个省的省会城市叫'平'开头？" -> but that's not standard. Alternatively, we can ask: "在'和平'中，'平'字的含义是什么？" -> but that's a bit abstract. Let's make it a simple fact: "中国哪个城市的名字里有'平'字？" -> but that's too vague. How about: "中国哪个省的省会是'平'字开头的？" -> the answer is Pingdingshan? But that's not a capital. Actually, the capital of Henan is Zhengzhou, but there's a city called Pingdingshan. However, we want a capital. Wait, the capital of Heilongjiang is Harbin, but that doesn't have '平'. Actually, the capital of Shanxi is Taiyuan, but we need a city with '平'. How about: "中国哪个省的省会城市名字以'平'开头？" -> the answer is Pingxiang? But Pingxiang is a city in Guangxi, not a capital. The capital of Guangxi is Nanning. So that's not right.

Let me think of a better one: "中国哪个城市的名字里有'平'字？" -> and the answer could be "平顶山" (Pingdingshan) or "平凉" (Pingliang). But we want a very easy question. So we can say: "中国哪个城市以'平'字开头？" and the answer is "平顶山" (but note: it's "Pingdingshan", so the first character is "平"). So the question: "中国哪个城市的名字以'平'字开头？" -> but the constraint says the question must contain the character "平". So we can write: "中国哪个城市的名字包含'平'字？" -> that has "平". So we'll use that.

But note: the constraint says "use the '平' character at least once", so we are using it in the question.

Q3 (English, medium): Must have a word with 'z'. We need a topic that is a bit more challenging. Example: "What is the z-score in statistics?" -> but that's a definition. We want a fact. How about: "What is the zodiac sign for someone born on June 15?" -> but that's not a fact that's easy to recall. Alternatively, we can ask: "What is the z-axis in a 3D coordinate system?" -> but that's a definition. Let's do a fact: "What is the name of the zodiac animal for the year 2023?" -> 2023 is the Year of the Rabbit. But we need a word with 'z'. The word "zodiac" has a 'z'. So the question: "What is the zodiac animal for the year 2023?" -> that has "zodiac" (which has a 'z').

Q4 (Chinese, medium): Must contain "平". We can ask about a common phrase. Example: "在'平均'这个词中，'平'字代表什么？" -> but that's a bit abstract. Alternatively, we can ask: "中国哪个省的简称是'晋'？" -> but that doesn't have "平". So we have to include "平". How about: "在'和平'中，'平'字的含义是什么？" -> but we want a factual question. Let's do: "中国哪个城市是'平'字开头的省会城市？" -> but there isn't one. So we'll stick to a city: "中国哪个城市的名字里有'平'字？" -> but we already used that for Q2. So we need a different one. How about: "在'平安'中，'平'字的含义是什么？" -> but that's not a fact, it's a meaning. We want a fact. So let's ask: "中国哪个省的省名包含'平'字？" -> the answer is "山西" (Shanxi) doesn't have '平', but "河南" (Henan) has '河' and '南', not '平'. Wait, "辽宁" (Liaoning) doesn't. Actually, "宁夏" (Ningxia) has '宁' and '夏', not '平'. How about "青海" (Qinghai) -> no. Wait, there is "海南" (Hainan) -> that has '海' and '南', but no '平'. Wait, we need a province that has the character '平' in its name. Actually, there is no province with '平' in its name. So we have to think of a different topic. How about: "在'平均'中，'平'字的读音是什么？" -> but that's not a fact. Alternatively, we can ask: "中国哪个城市是'平'字开头的？" and then we can have a specific city. But we already did that. So let's change the topic: "在'和平'中，'平'字的拼音是什么？" -> but that's not a fact. We want a fact. How about: "中国哪个城市在2020年获得了'联合国人居奖'？" -> but that doesn't have '平'. We need to include '平'. So we can say: "中国哪个城市在2020年获得了'和平城市'称号？" -> but that's not true. Alternatively, we can use a well-known fact: "中国哪个城市被称为'中国和平城市'？" -> but I don't think there is such a city. 

Wait, let's look for a fact that naturally includes the word "平". How about: "在'平型关战役'中，'平'字指的是哪个地方？" -> but that's a historical fact. The answer is Pingxingguan (平型关). So the question: "平型关战役中的'平'字指的是哪个地名？" -> that has "平" in the question. And the answer is "平型关" (but the question is asking for the place, so the answer is "平型关" or "Pingxingguan"). But note: the question must contain the character "平", and it does (in "平型关" and in the question we have "平" in "平型关战役" and in the question we write "平" in "平"字). So we can write: "平型关战役中的'平'字指的是哪个地名？" -> that has the character "平" (in "平"字).

Q5 (English, medium-hard): Must have a word with 'z'. We need a more challenging question. Example: "What is the z-component of the vector (3, 4, 5)?" -> but that's a math problem. We want a fact. How about: "What is the z-value for a 95% confidence interval in a standard normal distribution?" -> but that's a specific number. The answer is 1.96. But we need to make sure the question has a word with 'z
