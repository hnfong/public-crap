We are looking for lines that contain dialog or spoken text.
 We note that in the given text, dialog is often enclosed in quotation marks (either 「」 or “” or simple ""), but sometimes it might be without.
 However, in this text, we see that dialog is typically marked with 「」 or sometimes just quotes. Also, we see lines with exclamations that are spoken.

 Let's go through the lines:

 Line 4: 「轟隆！」 -> This is a sound effect (thunder), but it's not dialog. It's an onomatopoeia. We skip.
 Line 8: 「啊～！」 ... 「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」 -> This is spoken by the character (the old man). So we take this line.
 Line 12: 「轟隆！」 -> Again, thunder sound. Skip.
 Line 23: 「嘭！」 -> Sound of the door being kicked. Skip.
 Line 27: 「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」 -> This is spoken by the old man. Take.
 Line 29: 「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」 -> Spoken by the woman. Take.
 Line 33: 我「屌」一聲 -> This is an exclamation (swear word) spoken by the old man. We take the line because it contains the spoken word "屌".
 Line 39: 「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 -> Spoken by the old man. Take.
 Line 41: 「！！！」 -> This is not spoken words, but an expression of surprise. It's not dialog. Skip? But note the context: it's described as the woman's reaction. However, it's not a spoken word. We skip.
 Line 46: 「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」 -> Spoken by the old man. Take.
 Line 48: 「？？？」 -> This is not spoken, it's a representation of confusion. Skip.
 Line 50: 「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」 -> Spoken by the old man. Take.

 Now, note that the query says "dialog or spoken text". We are including exclamations that are uttered by characters (like "屌") and actual dialog.

 However, we must be cautious: the query says "only trigger when the input obviously matches". We are including:

 Line 8: has two parts of dialog: 「啊～！」 and 「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」
 Line 27: entire line is dialog.
 Line 29: has dialog at the beginning.
 Line 33: has the spoken word "屌".
 Line 39: entire line is dialog.
 Line 46: entire line is dialog.
 Line 50: entire line is dialog.

 But note: line 41 has 「！！！」 but it's described as the woman's "驚訝嘅眼神" (surprised look), so it's not actually spoken. We skip.

 Also, note that line 48 has 「？？？」 which is also not spoken.

 Therefore, the lines we output are: 8, 27, 29, 33, 39, 46, 50.

 Let's write them with the line number and then "---" as separator.

8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」

27:「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」
---
29:「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。難怪我同佢對打可以力拔山河。平時我邊有咁大力？佢口裡強硬，卻一個翻身跳出牆外，似乎想逃走。

33:我提劍急追，佢見我迫近，回身一劍，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕。
---
39:「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 我抑壓心抵嘅震驚，若無其事咁問。
---
46:「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」
---
50:「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」
