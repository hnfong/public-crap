A) No, water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). At -12 degrees Celsius, water is in a supercooled liquid state, meaning it's below its freezing point but hasn't frozen yet.

B) If you cool a glass of pure water to -12 degrees Celsius, it will remain in a liquid state, as long as it's not seeded with ice crystals or subjected to a shock that causes it to freeze. This is why water can exist as a supercooled liquid in very cold environments.
