This is a classic Magic: The Gathering puzzle involving stack interaction, priority, and the specific mechanics of damage prevention versus state-based actions.

Here is the step-by-step analysis of the optimal play and the outcome.

### 1. Board State Analysis

*   **Alice's Hand:** 2 copies of *Kindle*.
*   **Graveyard:** 0 copies of *Kindle* (initially).
*   **Bob's Board:** *Orim, Samite Healer* (1/3), untapped.
*   **Bob's Hand:** Empty.
*   **Mana:** Alice has sufficient mana; Bob has no mana (lands tapped), but Orim's ability does not require mana, only tapping.
*   **Goal:** Alice wants to reduce Orim's toughness to 0 or less. Bob wants to keep Orim alive.

### 2. Card Mechanics Review

*   **Kindle:** Instant. Deals $X$ damage, where $X = 2 + (\text{number of Kindles in all graveyards})$.
    *   *Crucial Rule:* When you cast a spell, it goes on the stack. It is **not** in the graveyard yet. It only moves to the graveyard after it resolves (or is countered).
*   **Orim, Samite Healer:** "{T}: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."
    *   This is an activated ability. It uses the stack.
    *   "Prevent" effects create a shield. If damage is dealt to the protected target, the shield absorbs up to 3 damage and disappears.

### 3. The Thought Process & Optimal Plays

#### Alice's Perspective (The Attacker)
Alice needs to deal at least 3 damage to Orim.
*   **Scenario A: Casting one Kindle.**
    *   Graveyard count = 0.
    *   $X = 2 + 0 = 2$.
    *   Damage = 2.
    *   Result: Orim takes 2 damage (1/3 $\to$ 1/1). Orim survives.
*   **Scenario B: Casting both Kindles sequentially.**
    *   Alice casts Kindle #1. Stack: [Kindle #1].
    *   If Kindle #1 resolves: Graveyard count becomes 1. Orim takes 2 damage.
    *   Alice casts Kindle #2. Stack: [Kindle #2].
    *   Graveyard count is now 1 (from Kindle #1).
    *   $X = 2 + 1 = 3$.
    *   Damage = 3.
    *   Result: If both resolve without interference, Orim takes $2 + 3 = 5$ damage. Orim dies.

**Alice's Optimal Play:** Cast the first *Kindle*. If it resolves, cast the second *Kindle* targeting Orim. She hopes to overwhelm Orim's prevention shield with 5 total damage.

#### Bob's Perspective (The Defender)
Bob knows Alice has two Kindles (or at least enough to threaten him). He knows his only defense is Orim's tap ability.
*   **The Constraint:** Orim can only prevent **3** damage total per turn.
*   **The Threat:** If Alice gets 5 damage through, the prevention shield will absorb 3, leaving 2 damage to hit Orim. Since Orim has 3 toughness, 2 damage is not lethal. Wait—let's re-calculate.
    *   Total Damage Potential: 5.
    *   Prevention Shield: 3.
    *   Net Damage: $5 - 3 = 2$.
    *   Orim's Toughness: 3.
    *   Result: Orim survives with 1 toughness remaining.

**Wait, let me re-evaluate the math.**
If Alice casts Kindle #1 (2 dmg) and Kindle #2 (3 dmg):
Total Damage = 5.
Orim prevents 3.
Remaining Damage = 2.
Orim takes 2 damage. $3 - 2 = 1$. Orim lives.

**Is there a way for Alice to win?**
Alice needs to deal **3** net damage.
To get 3 net damage through a 3-point shield, she needs to deal **6** total damage.
Can she deal 6 damage?
*   Kindle #1: $2+0 = 2$.
*   Kindle #2: $2+1 = 3$.
*   Total = 5.

It appears mathematically impossible for Alice to kill Orim with only two Kindles if Bob plays optimally, because the maximum damage she can generate is 5, and the shield absorbs 3, leaving 2 damage (non-lethal).

**However**, let's look closer at the stack interaction. Does the order matter? Can Bob force a bad exchange?

**Bob's Optimal Play:**
Bob must wait for Alice to commit her spells before activating Orim.
1.  Alice casts Kindle #1.
2.  Bob passes priority (he doesn't tap yet; he wants to see if she casts the second one).
3.  Alice casts Kindle #2.
4.  Now the stack has [Kindle #2, Kindle #1] (assuming LIFO resolution, but they are independent targets usually, though here both target Orim).
5.  Bob activates Orim's ability targeting Orim in response to the second Kindle (or before the first resolves).
    *   Stack: [Orim Ability, Kindle #2, Kindle #1].
6.  **Resolution:**
    *   **Orim Ability resolves:** "Prevent the next 3 damage..." shield is created on Orim.
    *   **Kindle #2 resolves:** Deals 3 damage ($2 + 1$ in GY). The shield absorbs 3. Shield is gone. Damage prevented is 3. Net damage to Orim = 0.
    *   **Kindle #1 resolves:** Deals 2 damage ($2 + 0$ in GY? **Wait, check GY count again**).

**Critical Rules Check on Kindle #1 Resolution:**
When Kindle #2 resolves, it is still on the stack. It has not hit the graveyard yet.
*   At the moment Kindle #2 resolves: Kindle #1 is still on the stack (it was cast first, so it resolves last).
*   Wait, standard stack logic: Last In, First Out.
    *   Alice casts K1.
    *   Alice casts K2.
    *   Stack: Top [K2], Bottom [K1].
    *   Bob activates Orim.
    *   Stack: Top [Orim], [K2], [K1].
    *   **Resolve Orim:** Shield set (3 dmg).
    *   **Resolve K2:** How many Kindles in GY? Only those that have *resolved*. Neither K1 nor K2 has resolved yet.
        *   GY Count = 0.
        *   $X = 2 + 0 = 2$.
        *   K2 deals 2 damage. Shield absorbs 2. Shield remaining = 1.
    *   **Resolve K1:** How many Kindles in GY? K2 has resolved and is now in the GY.
        *   GY Count = 1 (K2).
        *   $X = 2 + 1 = 3$.
        *   K1 deals 3 damage. Shield has 1 left. Shield absorbs 1. Shield breaks.
        *   Net damage to Orim = $3 - 1 = 2$.

**Result:** Orim takes 2 damage. Survives at 1/3 (marked with 2 damage).

**Does changing the order help Alice?**
No. The damage calculation depends on what is in the graveyard *at the moment of resolution*.
*   The first spell to resolve sees 0 Kindles in GY (Deals 2).
*   The second spell to resolve sees 1 Kindle in GY (Deals 3).
*   Total Damage = 5.
*   Total Prevention = 3.
*   Net Damage = 2.

**Conclusion so far:** Alice cannot kill Orim.

**Is there a trick?**
What if Alice casts one, lets it resolve, then casts the second?
1.  Alice casts K1.
2.  Bob passes.
3.  K1 resolves. Deals 2 damage. Orim is 1/3 with 2 damage marked. K1 goes to GY.
4.  Alice casts K2.
    *   GY Count = 1.
    *   $X = 3$.
5.  Bob activates Orim in response to K2.
    *   Shield prevents 3 damage.
    *   K2 resolves, deals 3 damage. All prevented.
6.  Total damage taken by Orim = 2 (from K1).
7.  Orim survives.

What if Bob taps *early*?
1.  Alice casts K1.
2.  Bob taps Orim immediately. Shield up (3).
3.  K1 resolves (2 dmg). Absorbed. Shield has 1 left.
4.  Alice casts K2 (GY count 1 -> 3 dmg).
5.  K2 resolves. Deals 3 dmg. Shield absorbs 1. Orim takes 2.
6.  Orim survives.

### 4. Final Verification of Rules (2024)

*   **Rule 608.2f:** If an effect requires information from the game (like counting cards in a graveyard), it uses the current state of the game at the time of resolution.
*   **Rule 615 (Prevention):** Prevention effects apply as the damage is being dealt. They reduce the damage event.
*   **State-Based Actions (704):** A creature dies if it has damage marked on it greater than or equal to its toughness. Orim is 1/3. He needs 3 damage to die.

**Calculation Summary:**
Max Damage Alice can output = 2 (first resolve) + 3 (second resolve) = 5.
Max Damage Bob can prevent = 3.
Minimum Damage Orim must take = $5 - 3 = 2$.
Toughness of Orim = 3.
$2 < 3$.

**Outcome:** Orim survives.

### 5. Optimal Play Sequence

Since Alice cannot win, her "optimal" play is simply to try her best sequence, knowing it will fail against a perfect opponent. Bob's optimal play is to time his activation to ensure no damage "wastes" the shield (though in this specific math, the shield covers the damage efficiently regardless of timing, as long as it's active before the larger hit or covers the sum).

Actually, is there a scenario where Bob messes up?
If Bob activates Orim *before* Alice casts the second spell, and Alice casts the second spell...
1. K1 resolves (2 dmg). Shield takes 2. Remaining shield: 1.
2. K2 resolves (3 dmg). Shield takes 1. Orim takes 2.
Same result.

What if Bob waits until the second spell is on the stack?
1. K1, K2 on stack.
2. Bob activates.
3. K2 resolves first (LIFO). GY count is 0 (K1 hasn't resolved). Damage = 2. Shield takes 2. Remaining: 1.
4. K1 resolves. GY count is 1 (K2 is in GY). Damage = 3. Shield takes 1. Orim takes 2.
Same result.

**It seems the outcome is invariant.** Alice deals 5, Bob prevents 3, Orim takes 2.

### Conclusion

**Optimal Play for Alice:**
1.  Cast the first *Kindle* targeting Orim.
2.  Allow it to resolve (or cast the second in response, it doesn't matter mathematically, but casting sequentially ensures the second one benefits from the first being in the graveyard).
    *   *Best sequence:* Cast Kindle #1. Let it resolve. Cast Kindle #2.
    *   Why? If she casts both at once, the second one to resolve (the first cast) sees 1 in GY. If she casts sequentially, the second cast definitely sees 1 in GY. The total damage is 5 either way.
3.  Accept that Orim will survive.

**Optimal Play for Bob:**
1.  Allow Alice to cast her spells.
2.  Activate Orim's ability targeting Orim **in response to the second Kindle** (or before the damage from the second Kindle resolves).
    *   Technically, Bob can activate at any point before the damage is dealt. The most robust play is to wait until Alice has committed both spells to the stack (or cast the second one), then activate. This ensures the 3-point prevention shield is active to mitigate the combined 5 damage.
3.  The shield will absorb 3 damage. Orim will take 2 damage.

**Final Outcome:**
*   **Orim, Samite Healer** survives with 2 damage marked on him (1 toughness remaining).
*   Alice's hand is empty.
*   Bob's Orim is tapped.
*   Alice fails to kill the threat.

**Why Alice loses this interaction:**
The scaling on *Kindle* ($2 + \text{count}$) is too slow. With two cards, the sequence is 2 then 3. Sum = 5.
If *Kindle* said "$1 + \text{count}$", the sequence would be 1 then 2 (Sum 3), which Bob prevents entirely.
If *Kindle* said "$3 + \text{count}$", the sequence would be 3 then 4 (Sum 7). $7 - 3 = 4$. Orim dies.
With the current text ($2+$), the math ($5-3=2$) leaves Orim alive.

**Answer Summary:**
The optimal play results in **Orim surviving**. Alice deals a maximum of 5 damage (2 from the first resolved spell, 3 from the second). Bob prevents 3 damage using Orim's ability. Orim takes 2 damage, which is less than his toughness of 3. There is no sequence of plays available to Alice with only two Kindles that results in lethal damage against an optimal Bob.
