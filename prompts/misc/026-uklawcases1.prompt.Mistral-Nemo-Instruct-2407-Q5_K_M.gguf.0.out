"R v Cunningham" (1957) is a significant case in UK criminal law that established the principle of "actus reus" in relation to the crime of burglary. The case involved a man who entered a shop after hours with the intention to commit a crime, but was caught before he could steal anything. The court held that the act of entering the shop with the intention to commit a crime was sufficient to constitute the offence of burglary, even if no theft had actually taken place. This case is significant because it broadened the definition of burglary to include cases where the offender had the intention to commit a crime, but was caught before they could carry out their plan. It also emphasized the importance of the mental element (mens rea) in criminal offences.

"R v Caldwell" (1982) is another important case in UK criminal law, which dealt with the issue of causation in criminal offences. The case involved a man who had been drinking and driving, and later crashed his car, causing the death of his passenger. The court held that the defendant's actions were the cause of his passenger's death, even though the passenger's own drunkenness may have contributed to the accident. This case is significant because it established the "but for" test for causation in criminal law, which means that the defendant's actions must be the cause of the harm, in the sense that "but for" the defendant's actions, the harm would not have occurred. This test has been widely applied in other areas of criminal law.

"R v G" (2003) is a case that dealt with the issue of consent in sexual offences. The case involved a man who had sex with a woman who was too drunk to consent. The court held that the defendant could not rely on the woman's initial consent to sex as a defence, because she was too intoxicated to give valid consent. This case is significant because it established that consent to sexual activity must be freely given, and that a person who is too intoxicated to give valid consent cannot be considered to have given consent. This case has had a significant impact on the law of sexual offences, and has helped to clarify the importance of consent in sexual relations.

In summary, these cases have had a significant impact on modern UK law by clarifying important principles in criminal law, such as the role of mens rea in criminal offences, the test for causation, and the importance of consent in sexual relations. They have helped to ensure that the law is applied fairly and consistently, and have provided important guidance to judges and lawyers in interpreting and applying criminal law.
