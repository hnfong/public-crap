Alright, I need to generate a fictional list of 30 events with specific columns: Event Name, Start Date, Start Time, End Date, End Time. The dates should be in the 2020s. Also, I should make some events have conflicting times. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I should structure the CSV with the required columns. The user wants 30 rows, so I'll need to come up with 30 different event names, each with start and end times and dates.

Since dates should be in the 2020s, I can choose random dates between 2020-01-01 and 2029-12-31. But since it's 2020s, maybe 2020-01-01 to 2029-12-31 but limit to 2020-2029. But perhaps better to just pick 2020-01-01 to 2029-12-31 but within 2020s.

But the user said 2020s, so maybe 2020-2029? Or just 2020-2029? Maybe better to have dates from 2020 to 2029.

Now, for each event, I can assign a unique name. Maybe use random names each time.

For start and end dates, I can generate random dates within 2020-2029. For start time and end time, perhaps assign times like "12:00 AM" to "11:59 PM" or something.

But to make some events have conflicting times, I can have events that start and end at the same time or overlap in a way that causes conflicts.

But since the user wants the dates not sorted, just random. So perhaps just generate 30 random dates in 2020-2029, random times.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Generate 30 event names. Maybe use random string functions or something.

2. For each event, assign a start date between 2020-01-01 and 2029-12-31.

3. Assign a start time: perhaps random time from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59.

4. Assign end date similarly.

5. Assign end time similarly.

6. Ensure some events have conflicting times. Maybe have two events that start and end at the same time or overlap in a way that causes issues.

But since it's a list of events, perhaps just have some events where the start and end times are the same or overlapping.

But perhaps better to have events where the end date is before the start date, which would be invalid but perhaps the user wants to have such.

But the user said "conflict", so perhaps events that have overlapping times or end before start.

But perhaps it's better to have events where the end date is before the start date, making them conflict.

So let me structure:

For each event:

- Event Name: random name.

- Start Date: random date in 2020-2029.

- Start Time: random time.

- End Date: random date in 2020-2029.

- End Time: random time.

But to have some conflicting, perhaps have events where end date is before start date.

So for example:

Event 1: Start Date: 2020-01-01, Start Time: 12:00 AM, End Date: 2020-01-02, End Time: 11:00 PM

But this would have end date after start date, so no conflict.

But to have conflicting, perhaps have an event that ends before it starts.

So Event 2: Start Date: 2020-01-02, Start Time: 12:00 AM, End Date: 2020-01-01, End Time: 11:00 PM

So this event ends before it starts.

So I can generate such events.

So perhaps create 15 events where end date is before start date, and 15 where end date is after.

But since the user wants 30 rows, perhaps mix them.

So perhaps:

For i in 1 to 30:

   Generate event i with random name.

   Generate random start date between 2020-01-01 and 2029-12-31.

   Generate random start time.

   Generate random end date.

   Generate random end time.

   If end date < start date: conflict.

But since dates are in 2020s, end date can be before start date.

But to avoid generating too many conflicts, perhaps just have 15 events where end date is before start date and 15 where end date is after.

So let me structure:

Create 30 events:

First 15:

   Start Date: random date in 2020-2029.

   End Date: random date before Start Date.

   So end date is earlier.

   Start Time: random time.

   End Time: random time.

Then next 15:

   Start Date: random date.

   End Date: random date after Start Date.

So no conflict.

But perhaps to have some events where end date is same as start date? Maybe not conflicting.

But perhaps better to have events where end date is before start date.

So let me proceed.

Now, to generate 30 rows:

I can use Python or something, but since I need to think, I'll outline.

But since I need to provide a response without code, I'll have to think of 30 events.

So perhaps:

Event 1: 2020-01-01 00:00:00 to 2020-01-01 23:59:59

Event 2: 2020-01-02 00:00:00 to 2020-01-01 23:59:59 (conflict)

But wait, end date before start date.

So Event 2: Start Date: 2020-01-02, End Date: 2020-01-01

So end date is before start date.

So such an event would have end date before start date.

So I can have 15 events where end date < start date and 15 where end date > start date.

So total 30.

So let me structure:

Events 1-15: end date < start date.

Events 16-30: end date > start date.

So now, to create 30 events.

I can list them as:

Event 1: 2020-01-01 00:00:00 to 2020-01-01 23:59:59

Event 2: 2020-01-02 00:00:00 to 2020-01-01 23:59:59 (conflict)

Event 3: 2020-01-03 00:00:00 to 2020-01-02 23:59:59

And so on.

But perhaps better to have random dates.

So perhaps:

For i in 1 to 30:

   Generate random start date between 2020-01-01 and 2029-12-31.

   Generate random end date <= start date or >=.

But perhaps better to have:

For first 15 events:

   Start Date: random date.

   End Date: random date before Start Date.

For next 15:

   Start Date: random date.

   End Date: random date after Start Date.

So let me try to create 30 events.

But since it's text, I'll have to list them.

So here's a possible list:

1. 2020-01-01 00:00:00 to 2020-01-01 23:59:59
2. 2020-01-02 00:00:00 to 2020-01-01 23:59:59 (conflict)
3. 2020-01-03 00:00:00 to 2020-01-02 23:59:59
4. 2020-01-0
