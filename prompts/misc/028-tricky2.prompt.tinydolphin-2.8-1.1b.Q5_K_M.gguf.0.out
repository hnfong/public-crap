Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

 Bob is right because he stated that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius. This is because the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius, which is the same as 0 degrees Kelvin. The freezing point of water is the temperature at which water molecules lose all their vapor and turn into ice crystals. [end of text]
