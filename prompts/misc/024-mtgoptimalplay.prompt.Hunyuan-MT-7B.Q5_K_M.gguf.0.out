In this situation, Alice's best play would be to use her 'Kindle' cards to deal damage to Orim. Since each 'Kindle' card deals X damage, where X is 2 plus the number of 'Kindle' cards in all graveyards, and there are two 'Kindle' cards in Alice's hand, each card will deal 2 + 2 = 4 damage to Orim, for a total of 8 damage.

Alice's thought process would be as follows:

1. Alice has two 'Kindle' cards in her hand, so each card can deal 4 damage to Orim.
2. By casting both 'Kindle' cards, Alice can deal a total of 8 damage to Orim, which should be enough to kill Orim, given its 1/3 health.
3. Since Orim is tapped, it cannot be tapped again, so Alice will not be able to use its ability to prevent damage this turn.

Bob's best play would be to try to prevent any further damage to Orim. However, since Orim is already on the battlefield and has been tapped, its ability cannot be activated this turn. Therefore, Bob's only option is to wait for the next turn to try to remove Orim from the battlefield or deal damage to Alice.

Bob's thought process would be as follows:

1. Orim is currently on the battlefield and tapped, so its ability cannot be activated this turn.
2. Alice has two 'Kindle' cards in her hand, which can deal a total of 8 damage to Orim.
3. Since Orim's health is only 1/3, it will be destroyed after receiving 8 damage from Alice's 'Kindle' cards.
4. Bob's only option is to wait for the next turn to try to remove Orim from the battlefield or deal damage to Alice, but since Orim is already defeated, there is no need to take any action this turn.

In summary, Alice's optimal play is to use her 'Kindle' cards to deal 8 damage to Orim, which will kill it. Bob's optimal play is to wait for the next turn to try to remove Orim from the battlefield or deal damage to Alice, but since Orim is already defeated, there is no need to take any action this turn.
