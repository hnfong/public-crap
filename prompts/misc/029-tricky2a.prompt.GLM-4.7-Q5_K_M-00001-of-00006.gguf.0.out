**Bob is right.**

Here is why:

1.  **The Process:** Freezing is not an instantaneous event that happens *only* at 0°C. It is a process that takes place as water cools down.
2.  **The State:** If water is at -10°C, it has already undergone the process of freezing. Therefore, describing its state as "frozen" (or saying "it freezes" in the past-tense sense of the result) is correct.
3.  **Alice's Misconception:** Alice is confusing the *freezing point* (the temperature where the phase change begins) with the state of the water. Once water drops below 0°C, it is ice. [end of text]
