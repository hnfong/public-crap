Okay, the user wants me to write a story about Snow White using only emojis. That's an interesting challenge! They specifically said I can't break this rule, so I need to be extra careful not to slip in any text. 

Hmm, the user seems playful - asking for creativity within strict constraints. Probably enjoys puzzles or visual storytelling. Maybe testing my emoji fluency? Or just wants fun content to share. 

For Snow White's story, I'll need key elements: princess 👑, evil queen 👸🏼💔, magic mirror 🪞, forest 🌳, dwarfs ⛏️👨👨👨👨👨👨👨, poisoned apple 🍎, prince 🤴, true love 💘. Should flow like: 

Start with 👑❤️🐦 showing her kindness. Then 👸🏼💔🪞➡️👑👿 for the queen's jealousy. Huntsman scene with 🧔‍♂️🗡️😢➡️🏃‍♀️🌳. Dwarf meeting ⛏️👨➡️👋😊. Cottage life 🏠🧹🍎. Queen's disguise 👵🍎😈. Poisoned bite 😵💀. Dwarfs' grief ⚰️💎😭. Prince's kiss 🤴💋👑. Happy ending 👰‍♀️🤴💒🎉. 

Wait - should I add the queen's punishment? Maybe 👸🏼👠🔥👿 for the hot iron shoes. And definitely 🐦🎶❤️ throughout for birdsong motif. 

User said "creative as you want" so I'll emphasize animal friendships 🐿️🦌❤️ and make dwarfs distinct with tools 🔨⛏️🔧. Final structure: 

1. Intro Snow White 
2. Queen's plot 
3. Forest escape 
4. Dwarf life 
5. Apple trap 
6. Sleeping death 
7. True love 
8. Queen's fate 
9. Wedding 

Hope the emoji sequence tells clear story! Testing readability: 👑❤️🐦➡️👸🏼💔🪞... yes, visual logic works. User better recognize common emojis though - might confuse 🪦 with ⚰️ but context helps. 

Adding sparkles ✨ for magic and rainbow 🌈 at end for hope. Done!
