Okay, let's see. Alice is asking what happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius. Bob says it freezes, but Alice corrects him by saying water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius. Then Bob insists he's still right. Hmm, so the main question here is: does water freeze at -10°C or at 0°C?

I remember from school that the freezing point of water is 0°C under standard atmospheric pressure. That's the temperature at which liquid water turns into ice. So if the temperature is below 0°C, like -10°C, the water should remain frozen, right? Wait, but maybe there's something else. Like, maybe if the water is supercooled? But supercooling is when water is cooled below 0°C without freezing, but that usually requires very pure water and no nucleation sites. But in most cases, once it reaches 0°C, it freezes. So if the temperature is -10°C, the water would already be frozen at 0°C, so staying at -10°C would just be ice getting colder. 

So Bob's statement that it freezes at -10°C is incorrect. The freezing point is 0°C. So Alice is right. But wait, maybe Bob is confusing freezing point with something else? Or perhaps there's a different context, like pressure? Because freezing points can change with pressure. For example, at higher pressures, the freezing point might decrease. But under normal pressure, which is standard, the freezing point is 0°C. Unless they're talking about different pressures, but the question doesn't mention that. So assuming standard pressure, Bob is wrong. Alice is correct. 

Wait, but maybe Bob is thinking that if you lower the temperature below 0°C, the water will freeze again? But once it's frozen, it's already ice. So if you have water at 0°C, it freezes. If you cool it further to -10°C, it's ice that's just colder. So the process of freezing happens at 0°C. So the answer is Alice is correct. Bob is mistaken because water freezes at 0°C, not -10°C. So Alice's right.

Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0°C under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10°C, the water would already be frozen (ice) at 0°C, and further cooling to -10°C would simply lower the temperature of the ice. Bob’s claim is incorrect because the freezing point of water is not -10°C. 

**Answer:** Alice is right. Water freezes at 0°C, not -10°C. [end of text]
