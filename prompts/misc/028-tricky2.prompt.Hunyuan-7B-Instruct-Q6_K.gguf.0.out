Alice is right. Water freezes at **0 degrees Celsius** under standard atmospheric pressure. The freezing point of water is a well-established scientific fact.

Bob's confusion likely stems from a misunderstanding of the freezing point of water. While water can freeze at slightly lower temperatures under specific conditions (e.g., if the pressure is reduced or impurities are present), the standard freezing point is **0 degrees Celsius**. Bob's statement about water freezing at -10 degrees Celsius is not accurate under normal conditions.
