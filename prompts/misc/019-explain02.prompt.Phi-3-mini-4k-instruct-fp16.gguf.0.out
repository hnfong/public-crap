Imagine you and your friends play in a big park where you all decide what games to play. Now, China has a big group of people called the National People Congress, and they work like a team in a much bigger park to make decisions for everyone in China.


Every two years, lots of people who live in China meet up in a huge place called Beijing, which is like the playground's main area. They talk about what is good and what they can do to make everyone's life better, like when you and your friends decide to have a picnic.


These people also think about rules, just like when your teacher gives you rules at school, so that everyone can play nicely in the park. So, the National People Congress is like the grown-up group of friends that helps take care of the big playground for all the people in China.<|end|>
