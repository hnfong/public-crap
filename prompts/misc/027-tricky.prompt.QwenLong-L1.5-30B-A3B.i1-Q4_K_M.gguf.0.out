Okay, let me tackle these two questions about water freezing at -12°C. First, I need to recall the standard freezing point of water. I remember that pure water freezes at 0°C under standard atmospheric pressure. So, if the temperature is below 0°C, like -12°C, it should freeze, right? But wait, the question is asking specifically about -12°C. So part A is a yes or no question: Does water freeze at -12°C? Well, since -12 is below 0, the answer should be yes. But I should make sure there aren't any exceptions. Like, does pressure affect this? The question doesn't mention anything about pressure, so I'll assume standard atmospheric pressure. So part A should be yes.

Now, part B is a bit more detailed. It says, "I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?" So, if the water is pure and cooled to -12°C, which is below its freezing point, it should freeze into ice. But wait, sometimes people talk about supercooling, where water can stay liquid below 0°C without freezing. But the question specifies "pure water," and supercooling usually requires very still conditions without nucleation sites. But the question doesn't mention anything about supercooling, so I think the expected answer is that it freezes. So the water would turn into ice at -12°C.

Wait, but let me double-check. The freezing point is 0°C, so at -12°C, which is colder, the water should be frozen. So both answers should be that water freezes at -12°C, and the glass of pure water would turn into ice. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything. For part A, the question is phrased as "Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?" So the answer is yes, because -12°C is below the freezing point. For part B, the glass of pure water cooled to -12°C would freeze, so it becomes solid ice.

Wait, but maybe part A is tricky. Sometimes people might think that "freeze at" means exactly at that temperature, but freezing occurs when the temperature is at or below the freezing point. So water freezes at 0°C and below, so at -12°C, it's definitely frozen. So part A is yes. Part B, the water would freeze into ice. I think that's straightforward. Let me confirm with some basic knowledge. The freezing point of water is 0°C, so any temperature below that should cause it to freeze. So both answers should be affirmative. But let me check if there's any common misconception here. For example, saltwater freezes at a lower temperature, but the question specifies pure water, so that's not an issue. So pure water at -12°C should be ice. Yeah, that makes sense. So the answers are yes for A, and the water freezes into ice for B.

A) **Yes**. Water freezes at 0°C under standard atmospheric pressure. Since -12°C is below 0°C, water will freeze at this temperature.  

B) The pure water will **freeze into ice**. At -12°C (below its freezing point of 0°C), the liquid water transitions to a solid state (ice), assuming no supercooling occurs (which requires very specific, disturbance-free conditions not mentioned here). [end of text]
