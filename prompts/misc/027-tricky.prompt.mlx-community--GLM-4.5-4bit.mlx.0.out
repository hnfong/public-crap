A) Yes, water can freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of pure water is 0 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure, meaning it will turn into ice at or below this temperature. At -12°C, water is well below its freezing point and will be in a solid (ice) state if it has had sufficient time to freeze.

B) If you cool a glass of pure water to -12 degrees Celsius, the water will freeze and turn into ice. The process involves the water molecules losing kinetic energy, forming a crystalline structure (ice), and releasing latent heat. The entire volume of water will eventually solidify, assuming the cooling is uniform and there are no impurities or disturbances that could slightly delay freezing (supercooling is possible but unlikely in a typical glass). The ice will be at -12°C, matching the surrounding temperature.
