Let’s analyze this Magic: The Gathering scenario step by step, using current (2024) rules.

### **Setup Recap**
- **Alice**: 2 copies of *Kindle* in hand. No other cards. Mana available (assume infinite or at least enough to cast both).
- **Bob**: 0 cards in hand. *Orim, Samite Healer* on battlefield, untapped. His lands are tapped out (so he can’t cast spells or activate abilities unless he has mana already — but tapped-out lands + no cards = no mana).
- *Orim*’s ability: **Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.**
- *Kindle* (instant): **"Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X = 2 + the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards."**

Important: *Kindle* is a **newer card** (from *March of the Machine: The Aftermath*, 2023), and its Oracle text is exactly as stated.

### **Key Mechanics & Observations**

#### 1. **How much damage does *Kindle* deal?**
- Base: 2 + (# of *Kindle*s in all graveyards).
- Initially, **no *Kindle*s in graveyards** (since none have been cast yet).
- So first *Kindle* cast deals **2 damage**.
- After first *Kindle* resolves and goes to graveyard, there is **1 *Kindle* in graveyards**.
- So second *Kindle* cast deals **3 damage**.

#### 2. **Orim’s prevention ability**
- Tap: Prevents **next 3 damage** to **any target** this turn.
- Can be activated **any time Bob has priority**, including in response to spells/abilities.
- But Bob has **no mana** (lands tapped out, no cards in hand → no way to untap lands or generate mana), so he **cannot activate Orim’s ability** unless he already had untapped lands or mana in his pool — but the prompt says *“Bob's lands are tapped out”*, implying **no mana available**, and no way to get more (no cards, no other permanents).
- So Bob **cannot activate Orim’s ability** this turn.

> ✅ **Rule reference**: MTG 605.3b — To activate an ability, the player must pay its costs. Tap costs require the permanent to be untapped *and* the player to have priority. But if the player has no mana and no way to generate it (e.g., no untapped lands, no mana sources), they cannot pay mana costs — and Orim’s ability has a **tap** cost and **no mana cost**, so only tap is required. Wait — correction!

Hold on: *Orim, Samite Healer*’s ability is: **"{T}: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."**  
→ **Only cost is tap**. No mana cost.

So Bob *can* activate it **as long as Orim is untapped and he has priority** — even with no mana.

But: Orim is currently **untapped** (per prompt). So Bob *could* tap it to prevent 3 damage — **if he gets priority before Alice finishes casting both *Kindles***.

Let’s walk through timing.

---

### **Turn Sequence & Priority**

It’s Alice’s turn. Assume it’s main phase (since she wants to cast spells — burn decks usually do this in main phase unless attacking).

- Alice has priority first.
- She can cast *Kindle* #1.
- Bob then gets priority *after* *Kindle* #1 is on the stack.
- Bob could tap Orim to prevent the damage *before* it resolves? No — *Kindle* is an instant, and damage happens on resolution. But prevention effects can be applied *in response* to the damage event — but in MTG, prevention is applied **as the damage is about to happen**, i.e., when the damage event is about to occur.

Let’s clarify with rules:

- *Kindle* deals damage directly — it’s a **damage-dealing spell**, not a combat damage event.
- Damage prevention effects (like Orim’s) apply **when damage would be dealt** — specifically, when the damage event is about to happen (615.3).
- So Bob can activate Orim’s ability **in response to *Kindle* resolving**, i.e., *after* *Kindle* resolves but *before* damage is dealt — or more precisely, *as the damage event is about to occur*.

But: *Kindle* resolves → damage is dealt *as part of resolution*. There is **no window** between resolution and damage — damage is dealt *immediately* on resolution.

However, **damage prevention is a replacement effect**, and players get priority *after* a spell resolves (602.7, 608.2g). So:

- *Kindle* resolves → damage is dealt *as part of the spell’s effect*.
- But before the damage is actually dealt, the game checks for replacement effects (615.10).
- Players may activate abilities *after* a spell resolves but *before* state-based actions are checked — but the key is: **damage prevention must be applied as a replacement effect *before* the damage occurs**.

Actually, per **715.3**:  
> "If an effect would deal damage to a permanent or player, the appropriate player gets priority to activate abilities that replace that damage."

So:  
- *Kindle* resolves → the game determines how much damage would be dealt (say, 2).  
- Then, **before damage is dealt**, players get priority to activate damage-prevention abilities.

Thus, Bob can activate Orim’s ability **in response to *Kindle* resolving**, i.e., *after* *Kindle* finishes resolving but *before* the damage is applied.

But wait — *Kindle* says: “deals X damage”. That’s a single damage event (not split). So the damage is dealt all at once.

So sequence for first *Kindle*:
1. Alice casts *Kindle* (targeting Orim).
2. *Kindle* resolves.
3. As it resolves, the game calculates X = 2 (no *Kindle*s in graveyards yet).
4. Damage event: 2 damage to Orim *would be dealt*.
5. **Before damage is actually dealt**, players get priority — Bob can activate Orim’s tap ability to prevent up to 3 damage.
6. If Bob does so, the next 3 damage is prevented — so the 2 damage is fully prevented.
7. Then damage is dealt (but replaced by prevention), so Orim takes 0 damage.

Then Alice gets priority again and can cast second *Kindle*.

Now graveyards have 1 *Kindle*, so second *Kindle* deals 3 damage.

Bob may again get priority and activate Orim again — but Orim is now **tapped** (if he activated once), so he **cannot activate again** this turn (602.2a: can’t activate an ability of a tapped permanent unless it says otherwise).

So if Bob activates Orim *once*, he prevents up to 3 damage — enough to prevent the first 2-damage *Kindle*, but only 1 damage of the second *Kindle* (3 − 2 = 1 left).

Let’s simulate both options for Bob.

---

### **Bob’s Options**

#### **Option 1: Do nothing**
- Cast first *Kindle* → deals 2 damage to Orim → Orim dies (1 HP).
- First *Kindle* goes to graveyard.
- Cast second *Kindle* → deals 3 damage (2 + 1 graveyard *Kindle*).
- But Orim is already dead — can’t take damage. So second *Kindle* must target something else (e.g., Bob himself, or another creature — but Bob has no other permanents). If Alice targets Bob with second *Kindle*, Bob takes 3 damage.

But Alice wants to kill Orim — she doesn’t care about Bob’s life total unless necessary. She can target Orim with both *Kindles* — but after first one, Orim is dead (1 HP), so second *Kindle* can’t target Orim (it’s in graveyard, and you can’t target a creature in graveyard with a spell that says “any target” — unless it specifies “creature or player”, but *Kindle* says “any target”, which includes *any permanent, player, or planarwalker* — and **a creature in graveyard is not a legal target** for a spell that says “any target” — only objects on the battlefield or in other zones if the spell specifies).

Wait! Critical point:

> **Can you target a creature in the graveyard with *Kindle*?**  
No. *Kindle* says: “deals X damage to any target”. In MTG, “any target” means any *legal* target — and a creature in the graveyard is **not a legal target** for a spell that doesn’t say “target creature card in graveyard” or similar.

So *Kindle* can target:
- Any **permanent** on the battlefield (creature, planeswalker, etc.)
- Any **player**
- Any **planarwalker**

But **not** objects in graveyards.

So if Orim dies (goes to graveyard), Alice **cannot** target him with the second *Kindle*.

Thus, Alice must choose:
- Target Orim with both *Kindles* **before** he dies — but she can’t do both at once.
- Or: target Orim with first *Kindle*, and if he survives, target again with second.

But Orim has 3 HP — wait! Orim is **1/3**, so 1 power, 3 toughness.

So:
- First *Kindle* deals 2 damage → Orim now has 1 damage marked (3 − 2 = 1 toughness remaining).
- Orim is still alive (3 − 2 = 1 HP left).
- Then second *Kindle* deals 3 damage → total damage = 5, but Orim only has 3 toughness → dies.

But Bob can prevent some damage.

Let’s recast with correct HP:

- Orim: 1/3 → 3 toughness.
- First *Kindle*: 2 damage → Orim now has 2 damage (still alive).
- Second *Kindle*: 3 damage → total 5 damage → lethal.

But Bob can prevent up to 3 damage total (if he activates once).

So:
- Alice casts first *Kind
