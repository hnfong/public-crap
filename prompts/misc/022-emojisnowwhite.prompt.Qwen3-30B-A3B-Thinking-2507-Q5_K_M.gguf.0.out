Okay, the user wants me to write a story about Snow White using only emojis, no words. That's a fun challenge! Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to recall the classic Snow White story elements: the poisoned apple, the seven dwarfs, the evil queen, the glass coffin. But since I can only use emojis, I'll have to represent each part visually.

Hmm, the user specified "you must write exclusively in emoji" and "may not break this rule." So absolutely no text allowed. I should make sure every element is conveyed through emoji symbols.

Let me plan the key scenes:
- Evil queen asking mirror about beauty (👑🪞)
- Snow White living with dwarfs (👩‍🦰👨‍🦱👨‍🦱...)
- Poisoned apple (🍎💀)
- Dwarfs finding her (👨‍🦱👨‍🦱...)
- Prince's kiss (🤴💋)
- Happy ending (👑💍)

I should use the most recognizable emojis for each element. For Snow White, 👩‍🦰 is perfect. The dwarfs can be represented by 👨‍🦱 (with the beard) since it's the standard emoji for dwarfs. The mirror should be 🪞, and the apple 🍎.

Wait, for the poisoned apple, I need to show it's dangerous. Maybe 🍎💀 would work. And the glass coffin could be 🪞⚰️ but that might be confusing. Actually, the classic glass coffin is often shown as a clear box, so maybe 🧊 coffin emoji? But there's no coffin emoji... I'll use 🪞 for the glass part and ⚰️ for coffin, but that might not be clear. Alternatively, just use 🍎⚰️ since the apple is the key element.

For the happy ending, 👰🤴💍 would show the wedding. And the dwarfs should be shown as a group, so 👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱.

I should avoid any text, so no "Snow White" written out. Just pure emoji sequence.

Let me check if all elements are covered:
- Evil queen: 👑 (crown)
- Mirror: 🪞
- Snow White: 👩‍🦰
- Dwarfs: 👨‍🦱 (repeated 7 times)
- Poisoned apple: 🍎💀
- Prince: 👑🤴 (but crown is already used, so maybe just 👑 for queen and 👑🤴 for prince? Wait, prince should have a crown too. Maybe 👑 for queen and 👑🤴 for prince to distinguish.)

Actually, the queen is 👑, and the prince is 👑🤴. But to save space, maybe just use 👑 for queen and 👑 for prince? No, better to use 👑🤴 for prince.

Also, the dwarfs should be shown as a group, so I'll use seven 👨‍🦱 emojis.

For the apple scene: 🍎💀 (apple with skull)

For the rescue: 👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱 → 🍎💀 → 👰🤴 → 💍

Wait, the dwarfs find her, then the prince comes. So sequence should be dwarfs finding her (👨‍🦱... → 👩‍🦰⚰️), then prince arrives (🤴), then kiss (💋), then wedding (💍).

But the coffin is important. I'll use ⚰️ for coffin, but it's a bit morbid. Maybe 🧊 for glass coffin? No, there's no glass coffin emoji. I'll use ⚰️ since it's the closest.

Actually, in emoji, there's no coffin, but ⚰️ is used for coffin. I'll go with that.

So the sequence:

👑🪞: Evil queen asks mirror
👩‍🦰: Snow White
👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱: Dwarfs
🍎💀: Poisoned apple
👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱 👩‍🦰⚰️: Dwarfs find her
🤴💋: Prince kisses
💍: Wedding

But the queen's jealousy should come first. So:

👑🪞: Queen asks mirror
👑: "I'm the fairest" (but no text, so just 👑🪞)
👩‍🦰: Snow White is fairer
👑💀: Queen angry (skull for death)
🍎💀: Poisoned apple
👩‍🦰🍎💀: Snow White eats it
👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱 👩‍🦰⚰️: Dwarfs find her
🤴💋: Prince kisses
💍: Happy ending

I think that covers it. Now, to make sure it's all emojis with no text. Let me count the emojis.

Also, for the mirror, it's 🪞, which is a mirror emoji. Good.

For the dwarfs, seven 👨‍🦱. I'll write them as seven separate emojis.

So the story would be:

👑🪞 👩‍🦰 👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱 🍎💀 👩‍🦰⚰️ 👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱 👰🤴 💍

Wait, that's not quite right. The queen asks the mirror, so 👑🪞 should be first. Then the mirror says Snow White is fairer, so 👩‍🦰. Then queen gets angry, so 👑💀. Then she makes the apple, 🍎💀. Then Snow White eats it, so 👩‍🦰🍎💀. Then dwarfs find her, 👨‍🦱... 👩‍🦰⚰️. Then prince comes, 👰🤴, then kiss 💋, then wedding 💍.

But I can't have text, so the sequence must imply the story.

Let me structure it as:

1. 👑🪞 (Queen asks mirror)
2. 👩‍🦰 (Mirror says Snow White is fairest)
3. 👑💀 (Queen angry)
4. 🍎💀 (Queen makes poisoned apple)
5. 👩‍🦰🍎💀 (Snow White eats it)
6. 👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱 👩‍🦰⚰️ (Dwarfs find her in coffin)
7. 👰🤴 💋 (Prince kisses)
8. 💍 (Wedding)

But the dwarfs are already living with her, so maybe the dwarfs are shown before the apple. So:

- 👩‍🦰 👨‍🦱👨‍🦱... (Snow White with dwarfs)
- 👑🪞 (Queen asks mirror)
- 👩‍🦰 (Mirror says Snow White is fairest)
- 👑💀 (Queen angry)
- 🍎💀 (Poisoned apple)
- 👩‍🦰🍎💀 (Snow White eats it)
- 👨‍🦱... 👩‍🦰⚰️ (Dwarfs find her)
- 👰🤴 💋 (Prince kisses)
- 💍 (Happy ending)

Yes, that flows better.

Now, to write it as a sequence of emojis without spaces? But the user said "write a story", so probably with spaces between emojis for readability.

In emoji stories, they're usually written with spaces between each emoji to make it clear.

So I'll write it as:

👩‍🦰 👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱 👑🪞 👩‍🦰 👑💀 🍎💀 👩‍🦰🍎💀 👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱 👩‍🦰⚰️ 👰🤴 💋 💍

Wait, but the dwarfs are with her, so the first line should be Snow White with dwarfs. So 👩‍🦰 👨‍🦱👨‍🦱... (seven dwarfs).

Then the queen asks the mirror: 👑🪞

Then mirror says Snow White is fairest: 👩‍🦰

Then queen angry: 👑💀

Then poisoned apple: 🍎💀

Then Snow White eats it: 👩‍🦰🍎💀

Then dwarfs find her: 👨‍🦱... 👩‍🦰⚰️

Then prince: 👰🤴 💋

Then wedding: 💍

I think that's good.

But let me confirm the emoji for coffin. There's no specific coffin emoji, but ⚰️ is used. I'll use that.

Also, for the prince, 👰 is bride, but for prince, it's 👑🤴. But the prince is the one kissing, so 👰🤴 might be confusing. Actually, 👰 is bride, so for the prince, it's just 👑🤴. But in the story, the prince is kissing Snow White, so it's 👰 (Snow White as bride) and 👑🤴 (prince), but since it's a kiss, maybe just 👰🤴 💋.

Yes, that's fine.

So final sequence:

👩‍🦰 👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱 👑🪞 👩‍🦰 👑💀 🍎💀 👩‍🦰🍎💀 👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱👨‍🦱 👩‍🦰⚰️ 👰🤴 💋 💍

I think that's the best I can do with emojis. Let me make sure there are no words. All emojis, no text.

Yes, this should work.
