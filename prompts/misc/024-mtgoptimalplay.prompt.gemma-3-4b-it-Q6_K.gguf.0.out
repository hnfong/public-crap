Okay, let's break down this Magic: The Gathering scenario and determine the optimal play for Alice and Bob.

**The Situation:**

* **Alice:** Two Kindles in hand.
* **Bob:** Orim, Samite Healer (1/3, Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage) in play, tapped lands.
* **Turn:** Alice's turn.
* **Orim's Status:** Unaffected by summoning sickness.

**Alice's Thought Process & Optimal Play:**

Alice's primary goal is to eliminate Orim. She has a powerful tool in Kindle, but it's a recursive one â€“ its damage increases with each Kindle in the graveyard.  She *could* just cast Kindle once, but that's likely not optimal.  Here's the breakdown of her thinking:

1. **Immediate Damage:**  Alice needs to deal at least 3 damage to Orim to kill it.
2. **Kindle Recursion:**  The key is to maximize the damage from her Kindles.  She wants to get as many Kindles into the graveyard as possible *before* dealing the final damage.
3. **Orim's Tap:**  Orim's tap ability is a significant obstacle.  It prevents damage from reaching Orim.

**Alice's Optimal Play: Cast Kindle twice.**

* **Turn 1:** Alice casts Kindle.  It deals 2 + 0 (no other Kindles in the graveyard) = 2 damage to Orim. Orim survives.
* **Turn 2:** Alice casts Kindle again. It deals 2 + 1 (one Kindle in the graveyard) = 3 damage to Orim. Orim dies.

**Why this is optimal:**

* **Guaranteed Kill:** Casting Kindle twice guarantees 3 damage, which is enough to kill Orim.
* **Maximizes Recursion:**  Each Kindle cast puts a copy of Kindle into the graveyard, increasing the damage output of subsequent Kindles.
* **Bypasses Orim's Tap:**  The damage is dealt *before* Orim's tap ability can prevent it.

**Bob's Thought Process & Optimal Play:**

Bob's goal is to survive. He has a single, relatively weak creature (Orim) and a tapped mana base. He needs to use Orim's tap ability effectively.

1. **Protect Orim:** Orim's tap is his primary defense.
2. **Don't Waste Mana:** Since he has no lands, he can't develop his mana base.  He needs to use his mana efficiently.

**Bob's Optimal Play: Do nothing.**

Bob simply taps Orim to prevent the damage from Alice's Kindles.  He's essentially sacrificing Orim to buy himself a turn.  He can't do anything else.

**Outcome:**

Alice wins the game. She successfully uses her Kindles to eliminate Orim, despite Bob's attempt to protect him.

**Game Mechanics Notes:**

* **Summoning Sickness:**  Orim was unaffected by summoning sickness because it was already on the battlefield.
* **Damage Resolution:** Damage is dealt simultaneously.  Orim's tap ability prevents damage from *reaching* Orim, not from being dealt.
* **Kindle's Damage Calculation:** The damage from Kindle is calculated *at the time of casting*.  The number of Kindles in the graveyard at that moment determines the damage.


**In summary, Alice's strategic use of Kindle recursion, combined with Bob's passive defense, leads to a decisive victory for Alice.**

Do you want me to explore a different scenario, perhaps with different cards or a different game state? [end of text]
