Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Here is an interpretation of the lyrics:

The lyrics describe a fantastical setting where a person is searching for a restaurant in the forest, but they cannot find it. They are wandering around, looking for a place to eat, but they are not making any progress. The restaurant is described as being small and empty, with no reservations. The person is looking for a place to eat, but they are not finding it.

The lyrics then describe a fantastical restaurant with a red-painted tin roof, where the menu is only recommended dishes. The kitchen is described as being full of music, with a violin, flute, cello, and viola playing. The person is invited to the restaurant, and they are told that if they eat well, they will fall asleep. The person is then told to leave, and they are told that tomorrow is a new day.

The lyrics then describe a fantastical scene where the person is walking through the forest, and they see a bear dancing. The bear is described as being a hand-riding bear, and they are dancing to the music of pasta, pizza, and omelets. The person is then told that there is no dessert, and they are told to deliver the food to the grave. The person is then told that it is the last full course of the night.
