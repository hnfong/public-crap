User asks: "Answer the following questions with brief explanations." There are two questions:

A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?
B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?

We need to answer with brief explanations.

Let's answer:

A) Water normally freezes at 0°C under standard atmospheric pressure. But the question "Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?" might be ambiguous. Under standard conditions, water remains liquid below 0°C if supercooled, but if it's pure water, it can be supercooled below 0°C. But the question "Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?" might be interpreted as "At -12°C, does water freeze?" The answer is yes, water will freeze at -12°C if nucleation occurs. But wait, water freezing point is 0°C. But if water is supercooled, it can remain liquid below 0°C. But if you have a glass of pure water, it might not freeze at -12°C if it's supercooled. But the question "Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?" might be answered: "Yes, water will freeze at -12°C if conditions allow nucleation, but pure water can be supercooled below 0°C." But the question is ambiguous. Let's check: "Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?" The answer: "Yes, water will freeze at -12°C if it is not supercooled. However, pure water can be supercooled below 0°C, so it might remain liquid until a disturbance triggers freezing." But the question "Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?" might be answered: "Yes, water will freeze at -12°C if it is not supercooled. But if it is pure water, it might remain liquid until a nucleation event occurs." But the question "I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?" might be answered: "It might remain liquid due to supercooling, but eventually, if disturbed, it will rapidly freeze." But wait, let's check: "I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?" The answer: "Under normal conditions, water freezes at 0°C. However, pure water can be supercooled below 0°C if there are no impurities or disturbances. So if you cool pure water to -12°C, it might remain liquid until a disturbance triggers freezing, at which point it will rapidly freeze." But the question might be answered: "At -12°C, water is well below its freezing point, so it should freeze. However, if the water is pure and free of impurities, it can be supercooled and remain liquid until a nucleation event occurs. In a glass of pure water, if it is undisturbed, it might remain liquid until it is disturbed, at which point it will freeze rapidly." But the question "Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?" might be answered: "Yes, water will freeze at -12°C if nucleation occurs, but pure water can be supercooled below 0°C." But the question "I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?" might be answered: "It might remain liquid due to supercooling, but eventually, if disturbed, it will freeze rapidly." But wait, let me check: "Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?" The answer: "Yes, water will freeze at -12°C if it is not supercooled. But if it is pure water, it can be supercooled below 0°C, so it might remain liquid until a disturbance triggers freezing." But the question "I have a glass of pure water.
