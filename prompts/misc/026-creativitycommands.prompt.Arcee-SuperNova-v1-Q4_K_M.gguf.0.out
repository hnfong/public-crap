A fascinating command!

Let's break it down step by step:

1. `cat wowfanfic.txt`: This reads the contents of the file `wowfanfic.txt` and outputs it to the standard output.
2. `perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'`: This Perl one-liner does the following:
	* `split(/\s/)`: splits the input into an array `@a` using whitespace characters (`\s`) as delimiters. This effectively tokenizes the text into individual words.
	* `foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }`: prints each word in the array on a new line.
3. `sort`: sorts the output of the Perl command, which is now a list of individual words, in alphabetical order.
4. `uniq -c`: counts the occurrences of each unique word and prefixes each line with the count.
5. `sort -n`: sorts the output of `uniq -c` in numerical order based on the count.
6. `tail -n 20`: shows only the last 20 lines of the sorted output, which corresponds to the 20 most frequent words in the text.

Given this pipeline, the probable output will be a list of the 20 most common words in your World of Warcraft fan fiction, along with their frequency counts. The list will be sorted in descending order of frequency, with the most common word at the top.

From a linguistic perspective, this output will likely reflect the following:

* Function words (e.g., "the", "and", "a", "of") will dominate the top of the list, as they are commonly used in English to provide grammatical structure and cohesion.
* Content words (e.g., "Warcraft", "Azeroth", "Thrall", "Sylvanas") related to the World of Warcraft universe may also appear, but likely lower in the list, as they are more specific to the fan fiction's topic.
* Proper nouns (e.g., character names, locations) might be scattered throughout the list, depending on their frequency of appearance in the text.

Keep in mind that the output will also depend on the writing style, tone, and genre of your fan fiction. For example, if your story is heavy on dialogue, you might see more instances of pronouns and conversational words. [end of text]
