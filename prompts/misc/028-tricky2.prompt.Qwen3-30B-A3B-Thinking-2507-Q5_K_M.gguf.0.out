Okay, the user presents a dialogue between Alice and Bob about water freezing at -10°C. Let me unpack this carefully.

First, I recall the standard freezing point of water is 0°C at standard atmospheric pressure. Alice correctly states this. Bob claims water freezes at -10°C, which is factually wrong. But then he says "I'm still right" - that's the tricky part.

Hmm, Bob's statement is confusing. If he meant water freezes at -10°C, that's incorrect. But maybe he's being sarcastic or making a different point? The dialogue doesn't suggest any context like pressure changes or impurities. 

Wait - perhaps Bob is referring to water that's already frozen? Like "water at -10°C is frozen" versus "water freezes at 0°C". But that's not what he said. He said "water freezes at -10°C" which is wrong. 

*checks scientific facts again* 
No, pure water freezes at exactly 0°C under normal conditions. Below that it's ice. So Bob's initial statement is false. His "I'm still right" must be a mistake. 

The user asks "who is right" - clearly Alice is correct. Bob's second statement is illogical. I should explain why his "I'm still right" doesn't hold. 

*mental note* Must clarify:
- Freezing point = 0°C (Alice correct)
- Water at -10°C = already frozen (Bob might be confusing state with point)
- But Bob's phrasing "freezes at -10°C" is wrong

Ah! That's the key. Bob probably meant "water at -10°C is frozen" but said "freezes at" which is different. "Freezes" refers to the transition point, not the state. So his wording is incorrect. 

Conclusion: Alice is right. Bob's statement is factually wrong, and his "I'm still right" is nonsensical. The explanation should be brief as requested.

*double-checking* 
Yes, no special conditions mentioned, so standard 0°C applies. No need to overcomplicate with supercooling or anything. 

Final answer: Alice is correct. Bob is wrong. His "I'm still right" is invalid.

Alice is correct. Water freezes at **0°C** under standard atmospheric pressure. Bob's statement that "water freezes at -10°C" is **factually wrong**.  

Bob's claim that "I'm still right" is illogical. If water is at **-10°C**, it is *already frozen* (solid ice), but the *freezing point* (the temperature at which liquid water turns to ice) is **0°C**. Bob confused the *state* of water at -10°C (frozen) with the *freezing point* (0°C).  

**Conclusion**: Alice is right. Bob is wrong. [end of text]
