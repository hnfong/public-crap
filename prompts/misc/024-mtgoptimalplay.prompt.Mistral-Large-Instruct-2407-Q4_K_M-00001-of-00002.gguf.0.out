 In this scenario, Alice wants to eliminate Orim, Samite Healer, which is a threat to her burn deck. Let's break down the optimal play for both players step by step.

### Alice's Optimal Play

1. **Cast the First Kindle:**
   - Alice casts the first Kindle, targeting Orim.
   - Kindle deals X damage, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards.
   - Initially, there are no Kindles in any graveyards, so X = 2.
   - Kindle deals 2 damage to Orim.

2. **Bob's Response:**
   - Bob can tap Orim to prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.
   - Bob taps Orim to prevent the 2 damage from the first Kindle.

3. **Cast the Second Kindle:**
   - Alice casts the second Kindle, targeting Orim again.
   - Now, there is one Kindle in the graveyard (the first one she cast), so X = 2 + 1 = 3.
   - Kindle deals 3 damage to Orim.

### Bob's Optimal Play

1. **Prevent Damage with Orim:**
   - When Alice casts the first Kindle, Bob taps Orim to prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.
   - This prevents the 2 damage from the first Kindle.

2. **No Further Actions:**
   - Bob has no further actions to take since his lands are tapped out and he has no cards in hand.

### Outcome

- **First Kindle:** Deals 2 damage to Orim, but Bob prevents it by tapping Orim.
- **Second Kindle:** Deals 3 damage to Orim. Since Orim has already prevented 2 damage this turn, the remaining 1 damage is not enough to kill Orim (Orim has 3 toughness).

### Thought Process

**Alice's Thought Process:**
- Alice knows that Orim can prevent 3 damage this turn.
- She casts the first Kindle to bait out Orim's damage prevention ability.
- She then casts the second Kindle, hoping to deal enough damage to kill Orim.

**Bob's Thought Process:**
- Bob knows that Alice has two Kindles and wants to kill Orim.
- He uses Orim's ability to prevent the damage from the first Kindle.
- He understands that even if Alice casts the second Kindle, Orim will still survive with 1 toughness remaining.

### Conclusion

In this scenario, Alice's optimal play is to cast both Kindles targeting Orim. However, Bob's optimal play is to use Orim's ability to prevent the damage from the first Kindle, ensuring that Orim survives the second Kindle with 1 toughness remaining. Therefore, Alice is unable to kill Orim with her current hand. [end of text]
