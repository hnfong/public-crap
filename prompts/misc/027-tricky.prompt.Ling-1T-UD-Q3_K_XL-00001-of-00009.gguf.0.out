A) **No**, water does not freeze at -12°C under normal conditions. Pure water freezes at **0°C** under standard atmospheric pressure. At -12°C, water is well below its freezing point and would be frozen (ice), **unless** it is supercooled (a metastable liquid state below 0°C without freezing).

B) If you have a **glass of pure water** cooled to -12°C:
- **Normally**, it would freeze into ice by 0°C, so at -12°C it would be solid ice.
- **However**, if the water is **very pure and undisturbed**, it might **supercool** (remain liquid below 0°C). In that case, cooling to -12°C could result in **supercooled liquid water**, which may freeze instantly if disturbed (like tapping the glass).

**Summary**: Under typical conditions, the water would freeze and be solid ice at -12°C. But supercooling is possible in carefully controlled, pure, and still conditions. [end of text]
