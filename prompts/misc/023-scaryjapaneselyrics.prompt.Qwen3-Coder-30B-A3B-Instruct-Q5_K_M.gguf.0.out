The story told by these lyrics is that of a **fantastical, abandoned forest restaurant that only opens at night and serves the dead**.

Here's the literal interpretation that makes sense in this fantastical setting:

The song describes a small, seemingly abandoned restaurant deep in the forest. The narrator mentions that even following acorns (a metaphor for following clues or paths) won't lead to it, suggesting it's hidden or perhaps only visible to certain beings. The restaurant has no reservations, is empty during lunchtime, and is populated by birds that laugh, indicating it's not a normal place.

The restaurant has a red-painted tin roof and only serves "recommended" items, with music from a string quartet coming from the kitchen. This is a clear indication that it's not a typical restaurant.

The key fantastical elements are:
- The restaurant is only accessible at night
- It serves "the forgotten" (people who have been forgotten by the living)
- The menu includes dishes like "carpaccio, paella, appetizers, risotto" but no desserts, suggesting it's a full meal but not a complete one (perhaps the dessert is the afterlife?)
- The phrase "お墓の中まで届けましょう" (let's deliver even to the inside of the grave) is a literal indication that the restaurant serves the dead
- The final "full course" meal is served "tonight" and is the "last" one, suggesting it's a final meal for the deceased

The mischievous and lighthearted melody contrasts with the dark theme of serving the dead, creating a whimsical yet eerie atmosphere. The song seems to be about a supernatural dining experience where the dead are served a final meal in a forest restaurant, with the birds and the music adding to the otherworldly ambiance.

The "right to left" movement and the dancing bear suggest a magical, almost carnival-like atmosphere, where the rules of the normal world don't apply. The restaurant is a place where the boundary between life and death is blurred, and it's a place where the forgotten are remembered through food and music. [end of text]
