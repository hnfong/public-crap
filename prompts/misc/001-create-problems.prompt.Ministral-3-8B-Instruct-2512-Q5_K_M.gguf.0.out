*(Objective: Mention concrete, steel, or recycled plastic; brief reasoning.)*

**Q3 (Medium):**
*"A ‘zombie’ virus in a lab was accidentally released. How would you design a containment protocol to prevent a pandemic? (3 steps max.)"*

**Q4 (Medium-Hard):**
*"In *The Matrix*, what’s the paradox of the ‘zombie’ (human) agents? How does it relate to free will?"*

### **Answer Key (Objective Scoring Guide)**
- **Q1–Q4**: 1 point per correct/accurate answer (e.g., Q1: stripes = 1pt; Q4: free will paradox = 1pt).
- **Q5/Q8**: 2 points for creativity + 1 point for thematic accuracy (e.g., Q5’s identity twist).
- **Q6/Q7**: 1 point per relevant detail (Q6: 3/3 methods = 3pts; Q7: 3/3细节 = 3pts).
- **Q8**: 2pts for balanced reasoning, 1pt for specificity (e.g., "限制军用" > "不让人用").

**Why This Works**:
- **Creativity**: Haikus, paradoxes, and "zombie" twists force nuanced responses.
- **Multi-lingual**: Chinese questions test cultural/linguistic depth (e.g., *平凡世界* reference).
- **Scalability**: Easy questions filter basic knowledge; hard ones probe critical thinking.
- **Objective**: Most answers are fact-checkable or structurally evaluable (e.g., steps, points). [end of text]
