Let's break down the situation and analyze the optimal play for both Alice and Bob in this Magic: The Gathering scenario. I'll explain the relevant rules and then walk through the decision tree.

---

## **1. The Cards and Their Effects**

### **Alice's Cards:**
- **Two copies of Kindle** (instant spells)
  - *Kindle text*: "Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards."
  - So, if there are *n* Kindles in graveyards, each Kindle deals (2 + n) damage.

  - If both are in her hand, and none are in graveyards (yet), each deals 2 + 0 = **2 damage** per cast.
  - If one or both have been previously grave-yanked (e.g., by a card like Grasp of the Dead or through some effect), the damage increases accordingly.

### **Bob's Board:**
- **Orim, Samite Healer** (1/3, colorless, untapped)
  - *Ability*: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."
    - This means if Alice tries to deal damage to Orim this turn, Bob can tap Orim to block that damage for the next three instances of damage this turn.
    - It does **not** prevent damage to other targets (Alice's other cards or her life).

## **2. The Situation at the Start of Alice's Turn**

- **Alice's hand:** 2 Kindle (no graveyards with Kindles yet, assuming this is the start of the turn)
- **Bob's board:** Orim, Samite Healer (untapped)
- **Bob's hand:** Empty
- **Alice's mana:** Sufficient to cast at least one Kindle (assuming she has the mana)
- **Bob's lands:** Tapped out (so he can't cast spells this turn)

### **Alice's Goal:**
- Kill Orim, since Orim is a threat to her burn strategy.

### **Bob's Goal:**
- Prevent Alice from killing Orim, using Orim's ability to block damage this turn.

## **3. Alice's Options on Her Turn**

### **A. Cast One or Both Kindles**

- Each Kindle is an instant, so Alice can choose to cast one or both at any time.
- If she casts one Kindle, it will deal 2 damage to a legal target (Orim is legal).
- If Bob has Orim on the board, and Alice tries to deal damage to it, Bob can tap Orim to prevent that damage for the next three instances of damage this turn (per the ability).

#### **What Happens If Alice Casts One Kindle?**
- Alice chooses to target Orim.
- Bob taps Orim (since it's legal to tap it and he wants to prevent damage).
- The first 2 damage from the spell is prevented (since the tap effect "prevents the next 3 damage this turn").
- The remaining (2 - 2 = 0) damage doesn't exist, so the spell does nothing.
- Orim remains on the board.

#### **What Happens If Alice Casts Both Kindles at Once?**
- The total damage would be 2 + 2 = 4 if no Kindles are in graveyards (but actually, each Kindle's damage is calculated separately based on the number of graveyards Kindles at the time of casting).
- However, the key is that Bob's ability only prevents damage to Orim that is dealt this turn. If both are cast and both target Orim, Bob can only prevent the next 3 instances of damage (from either spell). Since each deals 2, that's 4 total, so Bob can prevent all 4 (since 4 ≤ 3? Wait, no—let's clarify the wording).

Wait, let's clarify the wording of Orim's ability:

> "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."

This means that when Bob taps Orim, he can choose the next 3 instances of damage (from any source) that would hit Orim this turn to be unblocked. So if Alice casts two Kindles both targeting Orim, that's two separate 2-damage instants. Each deals 2 damage to Orim. So total of 4 damage.

But the wording says "the next 3 damage"—so Bob can only prevent 3 of those 4. So the fourth damage would still hit.

But in practice, since both are cast as separate instants, the timing is important. If Alice casts the first Kindle, Bob can respond by tapping Orim to prevent that 2 damage (since it's the "next" damage). Then the second Kindle would still hit for 2, unless Bob can do something else—but he can't cast spells this turn.

Alternatively, if Alice casts both at once (as two separate instant spells), the damage events are sequential. Bob can only prevent the first three damage instances this turn. So if both deal 2 each, that's four total, so Bob can prevent three, leaving one to get through.

But regardless, the key is that **Orim's ability only protects Orim from damage this turn**, and only the next three damage events (from any source) that would hit it.

## **4. Optimal Play Analysis**

### **Alice's Perspective:**
- She wants to remove Orim as quickly as possible.
- Her only way to deal damage is with her Kindles, which are instants.
- Each cast deals 2 damage (assuming no graveyards with Kindles yet).
- Bob's Orim can prevent up to 3 damage this turn to it, so if Alice only casts one, Bob can block all 2. If she casts two, Bob can block 3 of 4 (but since each is 2, it's 4 total, so one gets through).
- However, since Alice can cast both in the same turn (as separate instants), she can try to overwhelm the prevention.

But the key is: **Orim's ability only affects damage to itself**, not to other cards or to Alice. So even if one damage gets through, Orim is still on the board unless it's destroyed.

Wait—actually, if damage reduces Orim's health to zero or below, it's removed from the battlefield. So if Alice can get through 2 damage (by casting one Kindle and Bob letting it go through because he didn't need to block it? No—Bob will block it if he wants to prevent damage to Orim).

Wait, let's clarify: If Alice targets Orim with a Kindle, Bob can tap Orim to prevent that damage. So the damage never happens. So even if Alice has multiple spells, as long as they're all targeting Orim, Bob can keep blocking up to 3 damage events this turn.

But since Alice can cast as many as she wants (assuming mana), but Bob can only prevent 3 damage instances to Orim this turn, if Alice casts 4 Kindles targeting Orim, Bob can prevent 3 of the 8 total damage (4x2=8), so 5 would get through—but that's not necessary, since Orim only needs -4 to be destroyed (it's 1/3, so 4 damage to destroy it).

Wait, Orim's stats are 1/3. To destroy a 1/3 creature, you need to deal at least 4 damage (since it's already lost 1/3, so needs -4 total). So if Alice can get 4 damage onto Orim before Bob can block all of it, Orim is gone.

But Bob's ability can prevent up to 3 damage events this turn to Orim. So if Alice casts 4 Kindles all targeting Orim, that's 4 separate damage events (each 2 damage). Bob can prevent 3 of them. So one will go through, delivering 2 damage (total 2), not enough to destroy Orim (needs 4). So Orim survives.

If Alice casts 5 Kindles, Bob can prevent 3, so 2 damage events get through (10 total damage dealt, 2x5=10, Bob blocks 3*2=6, so 4 damage get through—wait, no, let's recalculate):

Wait, each spell is an event. If Alice casts N spells targeting Orim, that's N damage events (each 2 damage). Bob can prevent the next 3 damage events this turn. So if
