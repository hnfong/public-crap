🌟 Once upon a time, in a kingdom of snow and ice, lived a kind-hearted princess named Snow White. She had a heart of gold and a smile that could light up the darkest winter nights. 🏰

Her evil stepmother, the queen, was jealous of her beauty and kindness. She ordered a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. 🌲

But the huntsman, moved by Snow White's innocence, let her go. He even helped her find a cozy cottage in the woods, where she met seven friendly dwarfs. 🏹

Meanwhile, the queen, disguised as an old woman, offered Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White, trusting the queen, took a bite and fell into a deep sleep. 🍎

The dwarfs, heartbroken, put Snow White in a glass coffin. But a handsome prince, who had fallen in love with Snow White's portrait, heard of her plight. He kissed her, breaking the spell, and they lived happily ever after. 🌹

The queen, punished for her evil deeds, was turned into a stone statue, a reminder of the power of kindness and love. 🏰

And so, the story of Snow White became a tale of courage, love, and the triumph of good over evil. 🌟 [end of text]
