Explain the role of China's National People Congress to a 5 year old child who lives in London.
Alright, imagine you know how your school has a principal who helps make decisions for the whole school, right? Well, in China, there's a big group of people called the National People's Congress, or NPC for short. They are like a super-duper big group of people who help make important decisions for the whole country, just like how your principal helps make decisions for your school. They meet every year to talk about what's best for everyone in China, like how to keep people safe, happy, and healthy. So, the NPC is like the big team of helpers who make sure everything in China runs smoothly, just like how your principal helps make sure your school runs smoothly. [end of text]
