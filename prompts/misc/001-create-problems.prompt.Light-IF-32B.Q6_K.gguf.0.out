Got it, let's tackle this. First, I need to remember all the constraints: 8 questions, increasing difficulty, mix of English and Chinese, each English question has a "z" word, each Chinese question has "平" character, concise, objective answers, creative, wide range of topics.

Start with Q1 (easy). English, since we need to start with a "z" word. Maybe something simple like math or common knowledge. Let's say "What is the z-score for a data point equal to the mean in a normal distribution?" That's easy, answer is 0. Good.

Q2: Next, maybe a bit more, but still easy. Maybe a word with "z" and a simple fact. Like "Which zodiac animal comes right after the rabbit in the Chinese zodiac?" Answer: Dragon. Wait, no, rabbit is followed by dragon? Wait, yes, rabbit is 4, dragon is 5. Good.

Q3: Increase difficulty. Maybe a logic puzzle, but concise. English, need a "z" word. Let's say "If a zebra has 20 stripes on each side, how many stripes does it have in total? Assume symmetry." Answer: 40. Easy, but adds a bit of math.

Q4: Switch to Chinese, need "平" character. Maybe a common phrase or fact. Like "平日里，哪种动物会用‘平足’行走，且擅长游泳？" (In daily life, which animal uses 'flat feet' to walk and is good at swimming?) Answer: Duck. Wait, but need to make sure it's concise. Maybe adjust: "哪种动物平足行走，且擅长游泳？" That's shorter, uses "平". Good.

Q5: Increase difficulty. Maybe a mix of math and real-world. English, "z" word. Let's say "A zoo has 120 animals: 30% are birds, 25% are mammals, the rest are reptiles. How many reptiles are there?" Need to calculate: 30%+25%=55%, so 45% of 120 = 54. Good.

Q6: Chinese, "平" character, more challenging. Maybe a riddle or a fact about geography. Like "平流层中，哪种现象与臭氧层保护有关？" (In the stratosphere, which phenomenon is related to ozone layer protection?) Answer: 臭氧层吸收紫外线 (Ozone layer absorbs UV) or just "臭氧层" but need to be concise. Wait, maybe adjust: "平流层中，臭氧层主要吸收哪种辐射？" (In the stratosphere, what radiation does the ozone layer mainly absorb?) Answer: 紫外线 (UV). Good.

Q7: English, "z" word, more complex. Maybe a wordplay or a concept. Like "What word starts with 'z', means to make something smaller, and is the opposite of 'expand'?" Answer: Shrink. Wait, but need to make sure it's a word with "z" — no, "shrink" doesn't have "z". So change: "What word with a 'z' means to make something smaller, and is the opposite of 'expand'?" Wait, no word with "z" means shrink. So maybe "What word with a 'z' means to move quickly in a straight line, and is often used to describe a fast car?" Answer: Zoom. Good. That's a "z" word, and adds a bit of vocabulary.

Q8: Chinese, "平" character, hardest. Maybe a logic or a fact about culture or science. For example: "平年和闰年相比，哪一年的2月天数多？" (Compared to a common year, which year has more days in February?) Answer: 闰年 (Leap year). Good. But need to make sure it's challenging enough. Wait, maybe adjust to a more complex question: "平年和闰年相比，哪一年的全年天数多？" (Compared to a common year, which year has more days in total?) Answer: 闰年 (Leap year). That's easy, but maybe make it about calculating: "如果某年是平年，且2月有28天，那么这一年有多少天？" (If a year is a common year, and February has 28 days, how many days are there in total?) Answer: 365. Wait, but that's easy. To make it harder, maybe combine with a leap year rule: "根据公历规则，平年和闰年的区别在于能否被4整除，但能被100整除的年份必须能被400整除。2024年是平年吗？" (According to the Gregorian calendar, the difference between common and leap years is divisibility by 4, but years divisible by 100 must be divisible by 400. Is 2024 a common year?) Answer: No, it's a leap year. Good. That's more challenging.

Now, check the flow: Q1-8, increasing difficulty. Let's list each question with the constraints:

Q1: English, "z" word, easy.  
Q2: English, "z" word, easy.  
Q3: English, "z" word, simple math.  
Q4: Chinese, "平" character, easy.  
Q5: English, "z" word? Wait, no—wait, Q5 is English, but need to have a "z" word. Wait, no: constraint (g) is for English questions, all *questions* must contain at least a word with the "z" character. So Q5 must have a "z" word. So adjust Q5: For example, "A zoo has 120 animals: 30% are birds, 25% are mammals, the rest are reptiles. How many reptiles are there?" Yes, "zoo" is a "z" word.

Q6: Chinese, "平" character, medium.  
Q7: English, "z" word, medium.  
Q8: Chinese, "平" character, hard.

Now, make sure each question is concise, to the point.

Let's draft each question:

**Q1 (Easy, English):**  
What is the z-score for a data point equal to the mean in a normal distribution?  

**Answer:** 0  

**Q2 (Easy, English):**  
Which zodiac animal comes right after the rabbit in the Chinese zodiac?  

**Answer:** Dragon  

**Q3 (Medium, English):**  
If a zebra has 18 stripes on each side, how many stripes does it have in total?  

**Answer:** 36  

**Q4 (Easy, Chinese):**  
哪种动物平足行走，且擅长游泳？  

**Answer:** 鸭子 (Duck)  

**Q5 (Medium, English):**  
A zoo has 150 animals: 40% are birds, 30% are mammals, the rest are reptiles. How many reptiles are there?  

**Answer:** 45  

**Q6 (Medium, Chinese):**  
平流层中，臭氧层主要吸收哪种辐射？  

**Answer:** 紫外线 (UV)  

**Q7 (Hard, English):**  
What word with a "z" means to move quickly in a straight line, and is often used to describe a fast car?  

**Answer:** Zoom  

**Q8 (Hard, Chinese):**  
根据公历规则，平年和闰年的区别在于能否被4整除，但能被100整除的年份必须能被400整除。2024年是平年吗？  

**Answer:** 不是，2024年是闰年 (No, 2024 is a leap year)  

Now, check all constraints:

(a) Concise: Yes, each question is short.  
(b) Varying difficulty: Q1-8: Easy, easy, medium, easy, medium, medium, hard, hard? Wait, need to make sure difficulty increases gradually. Let's adjust: Q1 (easy), Q2 (easy), Q3 (medium), Q4 (easy), Q5 (medium), Q6 (medium), Q7 (hard), Q8 (hard). Wait, but we need to make sure the difficulty increases. So maybe swap Q4 and Q5? Wait, no—Q4 is Chinese, but let's make sure the overall difficulty is increasing. For example: Q1: z-score (easy), Q2: zodiac (easy), Q3: zebra math (medium), Q4: duck (easy), Q5: zoo math (medium), Q6: ozone layer (medium), Q7: word with z (hard), Q8: leap year rule (hard). That's okay, but maybe adjust Q4 to be a bit more challenging? Wait, no—Q4 is Chinese, and we need to include "平" character. Let's say Q4 is easy, then Q5 is medium, Q6 is medium, Q7 is hard, Q8 is hard. That's acceptable.

Now, check the "z" words: Q1: z-score, Q2: zodiac, Q3: zebra, Q5: zoo, Q7: z. Good.

Check "平" characters: Q4: 平足, Q6: 平流层, Q8: 平年. Good.

Now, make sure each question is concise. Let's revise for flow:

**Q1:** What is the z-score for a data point equal to the mean in a normal distribution?  
**Answer:** 0  

**Q2:** Which zodiac animal comes right after the rabbit in the Chinese zodiac?  
**Answer:** Dragon  

**Q3:** If a zebra has 18 stripes on each side, how many stripes does it have in total?  
**Answer:** 36  

**Q4:** 哪种动物平足行走，且擅长游泳？  
**Answer:** 鸭子  

**Q5:** A zoo has
