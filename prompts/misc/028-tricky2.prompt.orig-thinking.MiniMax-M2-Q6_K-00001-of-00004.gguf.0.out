First, the conversation is between Alice and Bob. Alice asks what happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius. Bob says water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius. Alice corrects him, saying water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius. Bob insists he's still right.

I need to figure out who is correct. The key point is the freezing point of water. From science, I know that pure water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. That's a basic fact.

Bob says water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius, which is incorrect for pure water. But he might be referring to something else, like salt water or other conditions. However, the question is about water in general, and Alice is talking about standard water.

Alice is correct that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius. Bob is wrong because he says -10 degrees.

But Bob says, "Yes, but I'm still right." That might imply he's thinking about supercooling or something. Supercooling is when water can be cooled below 0 degrees Celsius without freezing, but it doesn't mean it freezes at -10; it means it can be liquid below 0 but will freeze when it nucleates.

Bob says "water freezes at -10 degrees," which is not accurate. Freezing point is defined as 0 degrees for pure water.

Perhaps Bob is confusing freezing point with the temperature at which it might freeze under certain conditions, but that's not standard.

Maybe he's thinking about the Celsius scale or something, but that doesn't make sense.

Another thought: in some contexts, like in cooking or everyday language, people might say water freezes at 0, but Bob is stating -10, which is wrong.

Alice is right to correct him.

But Bob insists he's still right. Why? Maybe he's referring to the fact that water can exist as ice at -10 degrees, but that's not what he said. He said "water freezes at -10 degrees," which implies the freezing occurs at that temperature.

The question is: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" So, at -10 degrees, water is typically frozen, but it doesn't freeze at -10; it freezes at 0.

At -10 degrees, if water is already frozen, it remains ice. But the freezing happens at 0 degrees.

Bob's statement is incorrect because freezing occurs at 0 degrees, not -10.

Alice is correct.

But let's see Bob's response: "Yes, but I'm still right." This might be a trick. Perhaps he's thinking about the fact that water can be supercooled to -10 degrees and then freeze, but that's not the freezing point; the freezing point is still 0 degrees.

In thermodynamics, the freezing point is defined as the temperature at which liquid and solid phases are in equilibrium, which is 0 degrees for pure water.

So, Bob is wrong.

Perhaps in some systems, like with impurities, the freezing point can be lower, but for standard water, it's 0 degrees.

The question doesn't specify any conditions, so we assume standard conditions.

Therefore, Alice is right, and Bob is wrong.

But Bob says "I'm still right," which might be a joke or something, but based on science, he's incorrect.

I should explain briefly.

So, who is right? Alice is right.

Explanation: Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard pressure. At -10 degrees Celsius, water is already frozen, but it does not freeze at -10 degrees; it freezes at 0 degrees. Bob's statement is incorrect.

Alice is correct.

Alice is right. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10 degrees Celsius, water is typically already frozen (as ice), but it does not freeze at -10 degrees; the freezing occurs at 0 degrees. Bob's statement that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius is incorrect for pure water under normal conditions. Bob's claim that he is "still right" may stem from a misunderstanding, such as supercooling (where water can be temporarily liquid below 0 degrees but will freeze when nucleated), but this does not change the defined freezing point.
