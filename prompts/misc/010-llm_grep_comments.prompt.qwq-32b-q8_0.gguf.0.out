Okay, I need to perform a semantic grep for lines with comments in the given input. Let me start by understanding the task. The user wants all lines that contain comments. The input is a shell script with numbered lines.

First, I'll go through each line and check if it has a comment. In shell scripts, comments start with a '#'. However, the first line is a shebang `#!/bin/bash`, which starts with # but isn't a comment. So I need to be careful with that.

Looking at line 1: `1:#!/bin/bash` – the # here is part of the shebang, not a comment. So I should exclude this line.

Line 4 starts with `# Save the path...` – that's a comment. So include line 4.

Line 5 and 6 are assignments, no comments there. Line 8 is a function definition, no comment.

Line 15: `# This is a script...` – that's a comment. Include line 15.

Line 20: `# Download and build pkg-config` – comment, include line 20.

Line 29: `# Download and build ncurses` – comment, include 29.

Line 38: `# Download and build libevent` – comment, include 38.

Line 48: `# Download and build utf8proc` – comment, include 48.

Line 56: `# Download and build tmux` – comment, include 56.

Other lines like 10, 11 etc. don't have comments. The shebang on line1 is not a comment. So the lines with actual comments are 4,15,20,29,38,48,56.

Wait, let me double-check each line again to make sure I didn't miss any. Let's see:

Line 4: yes. Line 15: yes. Line 20: yes. Line 29: yes. Line 38: yes. Line 48: yes. Line 56: yes. Any others?

Looking at line 52: `make prefix="$prefix"` – no comment. Line 53 has a comment? No, it's a command. Line 65 is a ln command, no comment.

So those 7 lines are the ones with comments. The shebang is excluded. Alright, that's the list.
