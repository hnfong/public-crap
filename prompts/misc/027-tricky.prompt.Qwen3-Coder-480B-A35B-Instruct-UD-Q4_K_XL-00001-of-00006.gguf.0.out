A) **Yes, water freezes at -12 degrees Celsius.**

Water freezes at 0°C (32°F) at standard atmospheric pressure. Since -12°C is below 0°C, water will be in its solid state (ice) at this temperature.

B) **If pure water is cooled to -12 degrees Celsius, it will freeze and become ice.**

Pure water at -12°C is below its freezing point, so it will transition from liquid to solid state. The water molecules will arrange themselves into a crystalline structure, forming ice. The glass may also crack due to the expansion that occurs when water freezes. [end of text]
