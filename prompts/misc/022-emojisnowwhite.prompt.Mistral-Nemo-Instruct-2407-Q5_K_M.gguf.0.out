Now, please write a story about Snow White. While your protagonist must resemble the classical Snow White tales, you may be creative as you want.

🌸👑🌸 Once upon a time, in a kingdom filled with 🌳🍃, lived a princess named 🌸Snow White🌸. She was known for her beauty, but her stepmother, the queen, was jealous. The queen had a magic mirror that told her she was the fairest, but Snow White grew up to be even more beautiful. The queen, 😈, sent a 🐗 to kill Snow White, but the 🐗 couldn't harm her. Snow White ran away and met the seven 🐻. They let her stay in their cottage. The queen, disguised, offered Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White ate it and fell into a deep sleep. A prince 👑 saw her and fell in love. He kissed her, and she woke up. They lived happily ever after. 🌸👑🌸
