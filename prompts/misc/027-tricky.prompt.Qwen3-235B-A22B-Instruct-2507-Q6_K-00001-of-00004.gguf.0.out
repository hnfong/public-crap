A) **Yes**, water freezes at -12°C — but only under normal conditions if it already has ice or impurities to initiate freezing. Pure water can remain liquid below 0°C (a state called supercooling), but at -12°C, it will typically freeze.

B) If you cool a glass of **pure water** down to -12°C, it **may not freeze immediately**. Pure water can **supercool**, meaning it stays liquid below its normal freezing point (0°C) if there are no nucleation sites (like dust or ice crystals). However, once disturbed or if nucleation occurs, it will rapidly freeze. So, at -12°C, the water might be liquid (supercooled) or freeze, depending on conditions. [end of text]
