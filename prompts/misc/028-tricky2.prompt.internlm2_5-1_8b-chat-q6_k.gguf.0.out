Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is correct. Water indeed freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, which is why he initially stated that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius. However, Alice's statement is incorrect because water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, not -10 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius, regardless of the temperature.
