Yo, listen up, I'mma break it down for you,  
The Fed's the big boss, they keep the game in view.  
They control the money, like a DJ with the beat,  
Adjusting the flow, making sure it's neat.  

Interest rates, they set 'em high or low,  
Like a producer tweaking the track, you know?  
When rates are low, it's like a party vibe,  
People spend and borrow, the economy's alive.  

But when rates go up, it's like a chill session,  
People save more, spending gets less tension.  
They print the cash, like a label drops a mix,  
But too much, and inflation gets in the mix.  

They watch the market, like a manager on the scene,  
Making sure it's stable, keeping it clean.  
In times of crisis, they step in like a hero,  
Injecting cash, keeping the economy steady, yo.  

So, the Fed's the OG, keeping the game tight,  
Balancing the economy, day and night.  
They're the ones behind the curtain, pulling the strings,  
Making sure the money flows, and the economy sings.
