 I have written a fan fiction based on World of Warcraft characters. I saved the file into wowfanfic.txt

What is a probable output if I run this Linux command?

$ cat wowfanfic.txt | perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }' | sort |  uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 20

Explain your answer with respect to basic linguistic principles.
  The command you provided processes the file `wowfanfic.txt` and performs a series of operations to analyze the frequency of words in the text. Let's break down the command step by step:

1. **`cat wowfanfic.txt`**: This command reads the contents of the file `wowfanfic.txt` and outputs it to the standard output.

2. **`perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'`**: This Perl one-liner processes the input line by line (`-n` option). For each line, it splits the line into an array `@a` based on whitespace (`\s`). It then prints each element of the array on a new line.

3. **`sort`**: This command sorts the output alphabetically.

4. **`uniq -c`**: This command counts the number of occurrences of each unique line (word) in the sorted output.

5. **`sort -n`**: This command sorts the output numerically based on the count of occurrences.

6. **`tail -n 20`**: This command displays the last 20 lines of the sorted output.

### Probable Output

The probable output will be a list of the 20 most frequently occurring words in the `wowfanfic.txt` file, along with their counts. The words will be sorted in ascending order of their frequency, with the least frequent words appearing first.

### Explanation with Respect to Basic Linguistic Principles

1. **Tokenization**: The Perl script splits the text into individual words based on whitespace. This is a basic form of tokenization, where the text is broken down into smaller units (words) for analysis.

2. **Frequency Analysis**: The `uniq -c` command counts the occurrences of each unique word. This is a fundamental linguistic analysis technique to understand the distribution of words in a text.

3. **Sorting**: The `sort` commands sort the words first alphabetically and then numerically by frequency. This helps in identifying the most common words and understanding their prevalence in the text.

4. **Output**: The `tail -n 20` command ensures that only the 20 least frequent words are displayed. This is useful for identifying less common words or for further analysis of the text's vocabulary.

### Example Output

Here is a hypothetical example of what the output might look like:

```
      1 a
      1 and
      1 as
      1 at
      1 be
      1 but
      1 by
      1 for
      1 from
      1 had
      1 he
      1 her
      1 his
      1 in
      1 is
      1 it
      1 of
      1 on
      1 or
      1 the
```

This output shows the 20 least frequent words in the text, along with their counts. The actual words and counts will depend on the content of `wowfanfic.txt`. [end of text]
