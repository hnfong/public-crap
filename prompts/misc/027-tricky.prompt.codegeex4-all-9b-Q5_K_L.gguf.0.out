A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). Below this temperature, water turns into ice.

B) If you have a glass of pure water and it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, the water will start to freeze. The ice will form on the surface of the water, and the water will continue to cool until it reaches its freezing point. Once the water reaches its freezing point, it will turn into ice.
