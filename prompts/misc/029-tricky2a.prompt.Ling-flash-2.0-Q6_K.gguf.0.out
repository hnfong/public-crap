Bob is right.

While it's true that water typically freezes at 0°C under standard atmospheric pressure, the key here is that Alice said "water" freezes at 0°C, implying a phase change from liquid to solid. However, if the water is already supercooled (below 0°C without turning to ice), then at -10°C, it will indeed be frozen — meaning Bob's statement "It freezes" is correct in the context of what happens to water at -10°C, even if the phase change actually began earlier.

So, Bob is right because at -10°C, water is already in a frozen state — it has already frozen, which aligns with his answer. [end of text]
