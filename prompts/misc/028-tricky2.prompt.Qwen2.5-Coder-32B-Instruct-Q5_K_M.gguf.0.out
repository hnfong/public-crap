Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

assistant
Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (0Â°C) under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10 degrees Celsius, water would be in its frozen state, not transitioning from liquid to solid. Therefore, Bob's statement that "Water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius" is incorrect. [end of text]
