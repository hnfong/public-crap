Name a place in World of Warcraft lore for every character of the alphabet. Original vanilla WoW only, no expansions. Starting with "A for Azeroth".

Alright, I need to map every letter of the English alphabet to a unique place in World of Warcraft's original lore, focusing solely on Vanilla WoW without considering any expansions. Starting with "A for Azeroth" seems straightforward, but I should ensure that each subsequent letter corresponds to a distinct and significant location within the game's original setting. 

First, I'll list out all the letters of the alphabet to keep track: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Starting with "A for Azeroth" makes sense since Azeroth is the primary world in WoW. Next, I need to think of places that are well-known and significant in Vanilla WoW. For "B," perhaps "Bladespire" or "Bladespire Citadel," but I recall that Bladespire is more associated with Outland. Maybe "Borean Tundra" could be a better fit, but that's from the Wrath of the Lich King expansion. Hmm, I need to stick to Vanilla WoW only.

Moving on to "C," perhaps "Cenarion Circle" or "Cenarion Thicket." "Cenarion Circle" sounds more like an organization, so maybe "Cenarion Thicket" is better. But again, that's from later expansions. Maybe "Cathedral of Light" in Stratholme? That's from the original game, so that could work.

For "D," "Darnassus" is a major city, but it's associated with the Night Elves. Alternatively, "Duskwood" is a zone, but it's more of a region. Maybe "Duskwood" is acceptable.

"E" could be "Eversong Woods," which is a zone in the Eastern Kingdoms. That seems appropriate.

"F" might be tricky. "Felwood" is a zone, but it's more associated with the Burning Legion. Perhaps "Frostwall" in the Barrens?

"G" could be "Ghostlands," a zone known for its ghostly inhabitants.

"H" might be "Howling Fjord," a zone in the Borean Tundra.

"I" could be "Isle of Quel'Danas," though that's more from the Burning Crusade. Maybe "Isle of Thunder" in Zangarmarsh?

"J" is a bit challenging. "Jungle of Thunder" in Zangarmarsh? Or "Jungle of Shadows"?

"K" could be "Kargath" or "Kargathia," but I'm not sure if that's a recognized place. Maybe "Krasarang Wilds"?

"L" might be "Loch Modan," a zone known for its mining.

"M" could be "Mulgore," a zone in the Eastern Kingdoms.

"N" might be "Netherstorm," but that's from the Burning Crusade. Maybe "Nagrand" in Outland?

"O" could be "Oasis of Tranquility" or "Oasis of the Serpent," but I'm not sure. Perhaps "Oasis of Eternity"?

"P" might be "Pandaria," but that's from the Mists of Pandaria expansion. Maybe "Pilgrim's Rest"?

"Q" is tricky. "Quel'Thalas" is associated with the High Elves, but it's more of a kingdom. Maybe "Quel'Danas"?

"R" could be "Redridge Mountains," a zone known for its mining and farming.

"S" might be "Shadowmoon Valley," though that's from the Burning Crusade. Maybe "Shadowmoon" in Outland?

"T" could be "Teldrassil," the giant tree in the Eastern Kingdoms.

"U" might be "Undercity," but that's more of a zone associated with the Forsaken.

"V" could be "Vashj'ir," but that's from the Burning Crusade. Maybe "Vale of Eternal Blossoms"?

"W" might be "Winterspring," a zone known for its snowy landscapes.

"X" is challenging. "Xel'Naga" is a term from the lore, but not a place. Maybe "Xel'Naga Caverns"?

"Y" could be "Ysondre," but I'm not sure if that's a recognized place. Perhaps "Ymirjar" in Zangarmarsh?

"Z" might be "Zangarmarsh," a zone known for its marshlands and creatures.

Wait, some of these might not be the most accurate or well-known Vanilla WoW locations. I need to double-check each to ensure they fit within the original game's lore without introducing elements from expansions.

Also, considering the diversity of locations, I should aim for a mix of zones, cities, and significant areas within the game world. Ensuring that each letter corresponds to a unique and memorable place will make the mapping effective.

Perhaps I should also consider the cultural and historical significance of each place to align with the characters' origins or the storylines within Vanilla WoW.

Alright, I think I've got a good start. Time to finalize the mapping.
