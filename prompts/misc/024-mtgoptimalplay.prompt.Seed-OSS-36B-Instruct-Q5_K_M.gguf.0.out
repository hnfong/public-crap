<seed:think>
Got it, let's try to work through this step by step. First, I need to make sure I have all the cards' abilities right because that's crucial. 

First, Alice has two Kindles in hand. Kindle is an instant, so she can cast it any time, including during her turn, and she can cast multiple instants in a stack as long as she has mana (the problem says she has sufficient mana, so we don't have to worry about that). The effect of Kindle: "Deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards." So X = 2 + GY Kindles. Important: "all graveyards" – so both players' graveyards, but Alice is the only one with Kindles right now, so that's just hers initially.

Bob has Orim, Samite Healer in play, untapped. Orim's ability: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So it's a tap ability, which means when Bob activates it, he taps Orim, and then the next 3 damage to any single target (wait, no: "any target" – does that mean 3 damage total across any targets, or 3 damage per target? Wait, the wording is "prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." Let me check the actual Orim text to be sure, because sometimes wording is key. Orim, Samite Healer's ability is: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." The "any target" here – when they say "prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target," the standard interpretation is that it's 3 damage total, not per target. Wait, no, let me confirm with MTG rules. The prevention is for damage, so if it's "the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target," that means cumulative damage prevented up to 3. So if 2 damage is dealt to a target, that uses 2 of the 3; then 2 more to another target, that prevents 1 more (total 3), so the second target would take 1 damage. Is that right? Let me think of similar abilities: for example, Swords to Plowshares is "destroy target creature," so "any target" there would be one target. But Orim's is "the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target" – the wording is "the next 3 damage... to any target," so the damage is the unit, so 3 damage total, regardless of target. Let me check a reliable source: according to MTG's comprehensive rules, when an ability says "prevent the next N damage that would be dealt to any target," it's N damage total. For example, if you have that ability and someone deals 5 damage to you, you prevent 3, take 2. If they deal 2 to you and 2 to another, you prevent all 4? No, wait, "next 3 damage" – so the first 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn are prevented. So sequence: damage events are assigned, then prevented. So if two damage events happen: first 2 damage to target A, that's 2 of the 3 prevented, so A takes 0. Then 2 damage to target B: the next damage is 2, but only 1 remaining prevention, so B takes 1 damage. Yes, that's the correct interpretation because it's "the next 3 damage," so cumulative damage prevented, up to 3, across all targets this turn, once the ability is activated. Also, Orim is untapped initially, it's Alice's turn, so Bob can activate Orim's ability any time during Alice's turn (since instants can be responded to with instants, so Bob can tap Orim in response to Alice casting a Kindle, or before).

Goal: Alice wants to kill Orim. Orim is a 1/3 creature, so to kill it, she needs to deal 3 damage to it in total (since toughness is 3 – when damage is dealt to a creature, if total damage dealt to it since last time it would have died is more than or equal to its toughness, it dies). Wait, no: the rules for dealing damage to creatures: when damage is dealt to a creature, that damage is marked on it. At the end of the damage step, if a creature has damage marked on it greater than or equal to its toughness, it dies. So Orim has toughness 3, so if cumulative damage dealt to it is 3 or more, it dies.

Alice has two Kindles. Let's consider what happens when she casts a Kindle. Let's first figure out the value of X when she casts a Kindle. Let's denote GY as the number of Kindles in graveyards before casting the current Kindle. When she casts a Kindle, she casts the spell, which goes on the stack. When the spell resolves, it deals X damage, where X is 2 + GY at resolution time? Wait, the timing of when the GY count is checked: the ability says "X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards" – when is that number determined? For spell abilities, the value of X is determined when the spell is put on the stack, unless the spell has a delayed triggered ability or something, but Kindle is an instant that deals damage when it resolves, so the X is determined when the spell resolves, because that's when the damage is dealt. Wait, no: let's check the wording again: "Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards." The "where" clause defines X for the purpose of that damage dealing. So when the damage is dealt (i.e., when the spell resolves), we calculate X at that moment. So if Alice casts a Kindle, and then that Kindle goes to the graveyard after resolution (since instants go to graveyard when they resolve, right? Yes: "Whenever a player casts a spell, that player puts that card onto the stack. When a spell or ability resolves, if it's a sorcery or instant card, its controller puts it into their graveyard unless it says otherwise." So Kindles are instants, so when they resolve, they go to the graveyard.

So first, let's consider casting one Kindle first, then the second. Let's say Alice casts first Kindle: let's call it K1. When K1 resolves, how many Kindles are in graveyards? Before K1 resolves, GY is 0 (Alice hasn't cast any Kindles yet; she had two in hand, cast K1, so hand now has 1, K1 is on stack, then resolves). So when K1 resolves, GY is 0, so X=2+0=2. So K1 deals 2 damage to its target. Then, after K1 resolves, K1 goes to the graveyard, so now GY has 1 Kindle.

Now, if Alice then casts the second Kindle, K2. When K2 resolves, GY has 1 Kindle (from K1), so X=2+1=3. So K2 deals 3 damage to its target. Then K2 goes to graveyard, GY now has 2.

Alternatively, could she cast both Kindles at the same time? No, because you cast spells one at a time onto the stack, but you can cast multiple instants in response, so the stack would have K2, then K1 (since the last one cast is on top). But the order of resolution is stack order: top first, so K2 resolves first, then K1. Wait, does the order of casting affect the GY count when each resolves? Let's see: if she casts K1 first (stack: K1), then before K1 resolves, she casts K2 (stack: K2, K1). Now, K2 resolves first. At resolution of K2, how many Kindles are in GY? Still 0, because neither K1 nor K2 has gone to GY yet – they were cast, put on stack, not resolved yet. So K2 deals X=2+0=2 damage, then K2 goes to GY (now GY=1). Then K1 resolves: now GY=1 (from K2), so K1 deals X=2+1=3 damage, then K1 goes to GY (GY=2). So whether she casts K1 then K2, or K2 then K1, the total damage from both is 2+3=5, just distributed as either first 2 then 3, or first 3 then 2. Because the first one to resolve deals 2 (since GY was 0 before either resolved), the second one to resolve deals 3 (since one is now in GY after the first resolved).

Is there a way to get both Kindles to deal 3 damage? Let's see: to have X=3 for a Kindle, GY needs to have 1 Kindle when it resolves. So if a Kindle is in the GY before that Kindle resolves. But the only way a Kindle is in the GY before resolution is if another Kindle resolved earlier. So the first resolved Kindle can't have another Kindle in GY before it resolves, because no Kindles have resolved yet. So first resolved Kindle: X=2, second resolved Kindle: X=3. So total damage from two Kindles is 5, maximum possible, since that's the sum: 2+3=5.

Now, Orim's ability: Bob can activate it by tapping Orim, which prevents the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. So Bob's goal is to use Orim's ability to prevent enough damage so that Orim doesn't die. Orim has toughness 3, so if the damage dealt to Orim is 3 or more, it dies. So Bob wants to prevent damage to Orim such that the net damage to Orim is less than 3.

First, what's Alice's optimal play? She wants to deal as much damage as possible to Orim, probably all of it, because that's the threat. So she will target both Kindles at Orim, right? Because targeting anything else is worse – if she targets one at Orim and one at Bob, then Orim might take less damage. So optimal play for Alice is to cast both Kindles, targeting both at Orim, to deal maximum damage to Orim.

Now, when does Bob activate Orim's ability? Let's consider the timing of the stack. Let's walk through a turn step by step, but since it's Alice's turn, the main steps are: beginning of turn (untap, upkeep, draw – but the problem says it's Alice's turn, Orim has been on board a while, so we can assume we're past those steps, maybe in the combat step? Wait, no – Alice has instants, so she can cast them outside of combat too, but since she's trying to kill Orim, which is a creature, she can do it in any step, probably just cast the Kindles as soon as possible, maybe during her main phase.

Let's assume it's Alice's main phase, she has mana to cast both Kindles. Let's say she starts by casting the first Kindle (K1) targeting Orim. The stack is now [K1]. Now, Bob can respond to K1 by activating Orim's ability: "Tap Orim: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So Bob taps Orim, activates the ability – that's a triggered ability? No, it's an activated ability (tap to activate), so Bob can choose to activate it any time he has priority, which he does after Alice casts K1 (since she cast a spell, the stack is [K1], then priority passes to Bob). So Bob can activate Orim's ability now: he taps Orim, pays the tap cost (which is part of activating the ability), so the ability goes on the stack on top of K1. Now the stack is [Orim's ability, K1].

Orim's ability resolves first: what does it do? It's a prevention ability that will apply to the next 3 damage this turn. Then the stack is [K1] again, K1 resolves. K1 deals X damage to Orim. What's X? At resolution of K1, GY has 0 Kindles, so X=2. So 2 damage is dealt to Orim. Now, does Orim's prevention ability apply? Yes, because it's active: "prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So this 2 damage is the "next damage," so it's prevented. So Orim takes 0 damage from K1. Then K1 goes to the graveyard (GY=1 now).

Now, after K1 resolves, the stack is empty, priority passes to Alice (since she's the active player, after her spell resolves, she gets priority next). Now Alice can cast her second Kindle (K2), targeting Orim. Stack is [K2]. Now Bob has priority again – Orim is still tapped (because activating the ability tapped it, and it doesn't untap unless there's an effect, so Orim is tapped now). Wait, can Bob activate Orim's ability again? Orim's ability is "Tap: Prevent..." – so to activate it again, he would need to untap Orim first, right? Because it's tapped. Is there a way to untap Orim? The problem says Bob has no cards in hand, and his lands are tapped out, so he can't untap Orim (no mana to untap with, no abilities to untap it). So Orim is tapped after the first activation, so Bob can't activate it again, because activating it requires tapping it, and it's already tapped.

So now, K2 resolves. What's X now? GY has 1 Kindle (from K1), so X=2+1=3. So K2 deals 3 damage to Orim. Is there any prevention active? The first prevention ability was "the next 3 damage this turn" – we already used 2 damage of that prevention on K1, so there's 1 damage prevention remaining (3 total - 2 used = 1 left). So when K2 deals 3 damage to Orim, we prevent 1 damage (the remaining prevention), so Orim takes 3 - 1 = 2 damage from K2.

Now, total damage dealt to Orim: 0 (from K1) + 2 (from K2) = 2 damage. Orim's toughness is 3, so 2 damage is less than 3, so Orim doesn't die. Wait, but is that the only option for Bob? What if Bob doesn't activate Orim's ability in response to the first Kindle? Let's see that scenario.

Alternative: Alice casts K1 targeting Orim (stack [K1]). Bob chooses not to activate Orim's ability. Then K1 resolves: X=2 (GY=0), deals 2 damage to Orim. No prevention, so Orim takes 2 damage (now at 2 damage marked, toughness 3, so still alive). Then K1 goes to GY (GY=1). Now Alice casts K2 targeting Orim (stack [K2]). Now Bob can activate Orim's ability: Orim is untapped (he didn't tap it before), so Bob taps Orim, activates the ability (stack [Orim's ability, K2]). Orim's ability resolves, preventing next 3 damage. Then K2 resolves: X=3 (GY=1), deals 3 damage to Orim. The prevention is 3 damage, so all 3 are prevented. So Orim takes 0 damage from K2. Total damage to Orim: 2 + 0 = 2, still alive.

Another alternative: Alice casts both Kindles at once? Wait, you can't cast two spells simultaneously; you cast one, then the next in response. So stack would be [K2, K1] as before. Let's say Alice casts K1 first, then before K1 resolves, casts K2, so stack is K2 (top), K1 (bottom). Now Bob has priority after Alice casts K2 – what can he do? He can activate Orim's ability now: stack becomes [Orim's ability, K2, K1]. Orim's ability resolves, prevention active (3 damage). Then K2 resolves: X=2 (GY=0, because neither K1 nor K2 has resolved yet), deals 2 damage to Orim – prevented (uses 2 of 3). K2 goes to GY (GY=1). Then K1 resolves: X=3 (GY=1), deals 3 damage to Orim – prevention has 1 left, so 3-1=2 damage. Total damage: 2, same as before.

What if Bob activates Orim's ability after K2 resolves but before K1 resolves? Let's see: stack [K2, K1]. Bob does nothing, K2 resolves: 2 damage to Orim (no prevention), GY=1. Then stack [K1]. Now Bob can activate Orim's ability: stack [Orim's ability, K1]. Ability resolves, prevention active. K1 resolves: 3 damage to Orim, all 3 prevented. Total damage: 2 + 0 = 2. Same result.

Is there a way for Alice to get both Kindles to deal damage before Orim's prevention is used? Let's see: the first Kindle deals 2 damage, the second deals 3. If Bob doesn't activate Orim's ability at all, then total damage is 2+3=5, which would kill Orim (5 damage > 3 toughness). But why would Bob not activate Orim's ability? That's bad play for Bob. So Bob will activate it to prevent damage.

Wait, but when Bob activates Orim's ability, does it matter how much damage is prevented? Let's confirm the prevention again. The ability says "prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So it's 3 damage total, not per target. So if Alice targets both Kindles at Orim, and Bob activates Orim's ability once, tapping Orim, then the first damage dealt to Orim (from either Kindle) will be prevented up to 3.

Suppose Alice casts K1 (X=2) and K2 (X=3), both to Orim, in some order. Let's say K2 resolves first (X=2, because GY=0), deals 2 damage: prevented (3-2=1 left). Then K1 resolves (X=3, GY=1), deals 3 damage: prevent 1, so 2 damage. Total 2. If K1 resolves first (X=2, deals 2, prevented, 1 left), K2 resolves (X=3, deals 3, prevent 1, 2 damage). Same total.

Is there a way for Alice to cast one Kindle, have it deal damage, then cast the second before Orim's ability is activated? But Orim is untapped initially, so after the first Kindle is cast, Bob can activate the ability immediately. Since Bob is trying to prevent damage, he will activate it as soon as possible to cover as much damage as possible.

Wait, another angle: does the order of casting affect the GY count for the first resolved spell? Let's say Alice casts K1, it resolves, deals 2 damage (GY=0), then K2 is cast, resolves, deals 3 damage (GY=1). Total damage 5. If Bob activates Orim's ability only once, he can prevent 3 damage, so 5-3=2 damage to Orim. If he could activate it twice, he could prevent 6 damage, but he can't because Orim is tapped after first activation and can't be untapped.

Can Bob activate Orim's ability before Alice casts any Kindles? Let's say it's Alice's main phase, she hasn't cast anything yet. Bob has priority – can he activate Orim's ability then? Yes, because players can activate abilities at any time they have priority. So Bob could, on his own initiative, tap Orim to activate the prevention ability before Alice casts any Kindles. Then the stack is [Orim's ability], which resolves, setting up prevention for next 3 damage this turn. Then Alice casts K1: resolves, deals 2 damage (prevented, 1 left), K1 to GY. Then Alice casts K2: resolves, deals 3 damage (prevent 1, 2 damage). Same result: Orim takes 2 damage.

Is there a scenario where Orim dies? Let's see: when would damage to Orim be 3 or more? If the prevention doesn't cover all the damage. For that to happen, Bob would have to not activate Orim's ability, but that's bad play. Or if Alice can get both Kindles to deal damage after the prevention is used, but the prevention is 3 damage total, so two Kindles deal 5 damage, so 5-3=2, which is less than 3.

Wait, what if Alice targets one Kindle at Orim and one at Bob? Let's say K1 to Orim (2 damage), K2 to Bob (3 damage). If Bob activates Orim's ability: prevents 3 damage. If the 2 damage to Orim is prevented, then Orim takes 0, Bob takes 3 damage (but Bob is a player, damage to players doesn't kill them, just goes to life total). Then Orim is still alive. Worse for Alice.

What if Alice casts one Kindle, then the second, but Bob doesn't activate the ability until after the first? Let's say K1 resolves, 2 damage to Orim (no prevention), then K2 is cast, Bob activates ability: prevents 3 damage, so K2 deals 3 to Orim, all prevented. Total damage 2, Orim alive.

Is there a way for Alice to get X higher for the first Kindle? Let's see: X=2+GY. To have GY>0 when first Kindle resolves, she would need a Kindle already in GY, but she only has two in hand, so no. The first Kindle cast will resolve when GY is 0, so X=2. The second will resolve when GY is 1 (from first Kindle), so X=3. That's fixed, because instants go to GY when they resolve, so the first resolved Kindle is the first to go to GY, so the second resolved one benefits from that.

Another rule check: when a spell resolves, does it go to the graveyard before or after the damage is dealt? The damage is part of the spell's resolution. The resolution of an instant is: do what the spell says (deal damage), then if it's an instant/sorcery, put it into graveyard. So the order is: deal damage (calculate X at that moment), then card goes to GY. So when the first Kindle resolves: deal 2 damage (GY=0), then K1 to GY (GY=1). Correct, so the second Kindle's X is calculated after the first is in GY.

What about Orim's tapping: when Bob activates the ability, he taps Orim as part of the cost, right? Activated abilities have costs and effects. The cost here is "Tap Orim" – so to activate the ability, he must tap Orim, which is part of paying the cost. So once activated, Orim is tapped, and remains tapped unless untapped. Since Bob has no mana (lands tapped out) and no other cards, he can't untap Orim, so it stays tapped, can't activate the ability again.

Is there a possibility that the prevention is per target? Let's re-examine Orim's text: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." If it were per target, it would say "to each target" or "to target target," but it's "to any target." The key is "the next 3 damage" – damage is a quantity, not per target. For example, if it were per target, it would be "prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to target target this turn," but it's "any target," so the damage is the limit, not the target. Let's confirm with Gatherer: Orim, Samite Healer's ability as of 2024 (it's a core set card, hasn't been reprinted with different wording recently) – the ability is indeed "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." According to Wizards' official rulings, this ability prevents up to 3 damage total to any single target or multiple targets over the rest of the turn. So if 4 damage is dealt to one target, 3 is prevented, 1 is dealt. If 2 to target A and 2 to target B, 2+2=4 damage, so 3 prevented, 1 dealt (e.g., 2 to A prevented, 1 to B prevented, 1 to B dealt).

So applying that, if Alice deals 2 then 3 damage to Orim (total 5), Bob's prevention is 3, so 5-3=2 damage to Orim. If she deals 3 then 2, same thing: 3-3=0, 2-0=2, total 2. Either way, 2 damage, which is less than Orim's toughness of 3, so Orim doesn't die.

Wait, but what if Bob doesn't activate the ability at all? Then 2+3=5 damage to Orim, which is more than 3, so Orim dies. But Bob is playing optimally to prevent that, so he will activate the ability. Is there a way for Alice to force Bob to not activate the ability? No, because activating it is beneficial for Bob.

Is there a mistake in assuming both Kindles are targeted at Orim? What if Alice saves one Kindle for later? But she only has two, and the problem says she wants to kill Orim now, it's her turn, so she will cast both now.

Another thought: does the "next 3 damage" reset if it's not used? No, once activated, it's a one-time prevention of up to 3 damage that turn.

What about the turn: Orim's ability says "this turn" – so if Alice is in her main phase, and she casts both Kindles there, that's all during her turn, so the prevention lasts for the rest of her turn, which includes both Kindles.

Is there a way to have the first Kindle deal 3 damage? Let's say Alice casts a Kindle, but before it resolves, another Kindle is in the GY. But she can't have a Kindle in the GY before casting the first one, since she had two in hand, none in GY at start. The first Kindle cast goes to stack, resolves, then to GY – so the second Kindle can't resolve before the first is in GY, because the stack is last-in-first-out. So the second Kindle is cast after the first, so it's on top of the stack, resolves first? Wait, yes: if Alice casts K1 (stack [K1]), then casts K2 (stack [K2, K1]), so K2 resolves first. When K2 resolves, is K1 in the GY yet? No, K1 is still on the stack, below K2. So K2 resolves, deals damage (GY=0, so X=2), then K2 goes to GY (GY=1). Then K1 resolves, deals damage (GY=1, so X=3), then K1 goes to GY (GY=2). So the order of resolution is second cast first resolves, but still, the first resolved spell deals 2, second deals 3.

So no matter the order of casting, the two Kindles deal 2 and 3 damage, total 5. Bob can prevent 3 of that with Orim's ability (since he can activate it once, tapping Orim, and can't activate again), so Orim takes 2 damage, which is not enough to kill it (needs 3).

Wait, but Orim's toughness is 3 – damage is cumulative, but it only dies if the damage is greater than or equal to toughness. So 2 damage is less than 3, so it lives.

Is there a scenario where Alice can deal 3 damage to Orim before Bob can activate the ability? Let's say Alice casts K2 first (target Orim), and before Bob can respond, it resolves. But in MTG, after you cast a spell, the next player gets priority to respond, so Bob can always activate Orim's ability in response to any spell Alice casts, unless he chooses not to. Since he's optimal, he will respond.

Another edge case: what if Alice casts one Kindle, it resolves, deals 2 damage (no prevention), then before she casts the second, Bob activates Orim's ability. Then the second Kindle deals 3 damage, all prevented. Total damage 2, Orim lives.

Is there any way for Alice to get more than 5 damage? No, she only has two Kindles. Each Kindle can deal at most 3 damage (since with two Kindles, the maximum X for any is 3: 2+1=3). So 2+3=5 is max.

Bob's only option is to activate Orim's ability once, preventing 3 damage, leaving 2 damage on Orim, which isn't enough to kill it.

Wait, but let's confirm the damage calculation again. Suppose Bob activates Orim's ability, preventing next 3 damage. First damage event: 2 damage to Orim – prevent all 2, so 0 dealt. Now, the prevention has 3-2=1 remaining. Second damage event: 3 damage to Orim – prevent 1, so 2 dealt. Total dealt: 0+2=2. Correct.

If the prevention were per target, it would be "prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to target target," but it's "any target," so total damage. So that's the right call.

Another check: Orim is a legendary creature, 1/3, so to kill it, you need to deal 3 damage to it in the same turn? No, damage accumulates across turns, but Alice is trying to kill it now, on her turn, so she needs to deal enough damage this turn to get it to 3 or more.

Since 2 damage is the maximum she can deal even with optimal play (her casting both at Orim) and Bob activating Orim's ability once, Orim survives.

Is there a mistake in assuming Bob can't activate the ability twice? Let's see: Orim is tapped after first activation. To activate again, he needs to untap it. Can he untap it? He has no cards in hand, so no instant to untap it. His lands are tapped out, so no mana to pay for an untap ability (even if he had one). So Orim stays tapped, can't activate again.

Therefore, the outcome is Orim survives, dealing 2 damage total, which is less than its toughness of 3.</seed:think>To determine the optimal play and outcome, we analyze the key mechanics of **Kindle** and **Orim, Samite Healer**, then model the interaction between Alice (attacking) and Bob (defending).


### **Key Card Mechanics**  
#### **Kindle (Alice’s Instant)**  
- Deals \( X \) damage to any target, where \( X = 2 + \) number of *Kindle* cards in all graveyards (GY) **when the spell resolves**.  
- Instants go to the GY immediately after resolving.  


#### **Orim, Samite Healer (Bob’s Creature)**  
- \( 1/3 \) toughness (dies if dealt ≥3 damage).  
- Activated ability: *Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn*.  
- Once tapped, Orim remains tapped unless untapped (Bob has no mana/cards to untap it).  


### **Optimal Play for Alice**  
Alice’s goal is to deal maximum damage to Orim. She has two Kindles, so she will cast both, targeting Orim exclusively (targeting anything else reduces damage to Orim).  

- **First Kindle (K1):** When cast, K1 resolves when no Kindles are in the GY (\( X = 2 + 0 = 2 \) damage). After resolving, K1 goes to the GY (now 1 Kindle in GY).  
- **Second Kindle (K2):** When cast, K2 resolves when 1 Kindle is in the GY (\( X = 2 + 1 = 3 \) damage). After resolving, K2 goes to the GY (now 2 Kindles in GY).  

**Total potential damage to Orim:** \( 2 + 3 = 5 \) damage (fixed, regardless of casting order).


### **Optimal Play for Bob**  
Bob’s goal is to use Orim’s ability to prevent enough damage to keep Orim alive (≥3 damage needed to kill it).  

- Orim is untapped initially, so Bob can activate its ability *any time he gains priority* (after Alice casts a Kindle).  
- Activating Orim’s ability taps it (permanently, since Bob can’t untap it) and prevents up to 3 damage total this turn (not per target).  


### **Scenario Analysis**  
Alice casts both Kindles; Bob responds optimally by activating Orim’s ability once:  

1. **Alice casts K1 (target Orim):** Stack = [K1].  
   - Bob activates Orim’s ability (taps Orim), stack = [Orim’s Ability, K1].  
   - Orim’s Ability resolves: Prevents next 3 damage this turn.  
   - K1 resolves: Deals 2 damage to Orim (all prevented, using 2/3 prevention). K1 → GY (1 Kindle now).  

2. **Alice casts K2 (target Orim):** Stack = [K2].  
   - Orim is tapped (can’t activate ability again).  
   - K2 resolves: Deals 3 damage to Orim (only 1/3 prevention remaining). Orim takes \( 3 - 1 = 2 \) damage. K2 → GY (2 Kindles now).  


### **Outcome**  
Total damage dealt to Orim: \( 0 + 2 = 2 \) damage (less than its toughness of 3). Orim survives.


**Final Result:** Orim, Samite Healer remains in play; Alice cannot kill it with two Kindles due to Bob’s optimal use of Orim’s prevention ability.


**Answer:** Orim survives. Alice deals 2 damage total to Orim (insufficient to reach its 3 toughness) because Bob activates Orim's ability once, preventing 3 damage across both Kindles. [end of text]
