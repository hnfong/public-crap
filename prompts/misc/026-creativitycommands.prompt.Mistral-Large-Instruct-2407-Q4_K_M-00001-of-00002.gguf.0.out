 The command you provided processes the text file `wowfanfic.txt` through a series of operations:

1. `cat wowfanfic.txt`: Outputs the contents of the file.
2. `perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'`: Splits the text into words based on whitespace and prints each word on a new line.
3. `sort`: Sorts the words alphabetically.
4. `uniq -c`: Counts the occurrences of each unique word.
5. `sort -n`: Sorts the word counts numerically.
6. `tail -n 20`: Displays the last 20 lines, which correspond to the 20 most frequent words.

Given this sequence of operations, the probable output will be a list of the 20 most frequently occurring words in the text file, along with their counts.

### Basic Linguistic Principles

1. **Frequency of Common Words**: In any text, certain words tend to appear more frequently than others. These are often function words like articles (e.g., "the," "a"), prepositions (e.g., "of," "in"), and pronouns (e.g., "he," "she").

2. **Zipf's Law**: This empirical law states that the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. This means that the most common word will occur approximately twice as often as the second most common word, three times as often as the third most common word, and so forth.

3. **Content vs. Function Words**: Content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs) carry the main meaning of the text, while function words (articles, prepositions, conjunctions) provide grammatical structure. Function words tend to be more frequent.

### Expected Output

Based on these principles, the output will likely include common function words and possibly some content words that are central to the story. For example:

```
      123 the
      110 of
       95 and
       80 to
       75 a
       60 in
       55 that
       50 it
       45 was
       40 he
       35 with
       30 his
       25 for
       20 as
       18 on
       15 is
       12 or
       10 an
        8 by
        7 at
```

This list shows the most frequent words in descending order of their counts. The exact words and counts will depend on the specific content of `wowfanfic.txt`, but the general pattern will follow the principles outlined above. [end of text]
