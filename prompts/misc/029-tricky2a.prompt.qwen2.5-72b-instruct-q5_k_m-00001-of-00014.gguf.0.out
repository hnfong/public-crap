Alice is correct in stating that water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius. However, Bob's statement can also be considered correct in a specific context. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Standard Freezing Point**: Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. This is a well-known fact and is what Alice is referring to.

2. **Supercooling**: Water can sometimes remain in a liquid state even below 0 degrees Celsius. This phenomenon is called supercooling. Supercooled water can exist down to about -40 degrees Celsius, but it is very unstable and can freeze rapidly if disturbed or if a nucleation site (like a speck of dust) is introduced. At -10 degrees Celsius, supercooled water is quite possible, but it is not a common or stable state.

3. **Bob's Context**: Bob might be implying that if water is at -10 degrees Celsius, it is already frozen or will freeze very quickly. This is a practical observation, as water at -10 degrees Celsius is well below the freezing point and will typically be in a frozen state.

In summary, Alice is correct about the standard freezing point of water, but Bob's statement can be correct in the context of practical observations where water at -10 degrees Celsius is likely to be frozen. Both statements can be true depending on the specific conditions and context. [end of text]
