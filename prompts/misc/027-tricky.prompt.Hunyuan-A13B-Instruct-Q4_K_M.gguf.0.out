A) No, pure water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. The freezing point of pure water is 0 degrees Celsius. At -12 degrees Celsius, water would be in a frozen (ice) state if it had enough time to freeze and if there were no impurities or supercooling effects.

B) If you cool a glass of pure water to -12 degrees Celsius, it will eventually freeze into ice. However, this process might take some time, and the water could temporarily exist in a supercooled liquid state if it is free of impurities and disturbances. Supercooling is a phenomenon where water remains liquid below its freezing point until it comes into contact with a nucleation site (e.g., a small ice crystal or rough surface) that triggers freezing.
