Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Give me your interpretation. You do not have to translate the contents, but you may if you wish.

The lyrics describe a whimsical and enchanting journey to a secluded restaurant deep in the forest. The story begins with the protagonist searching for the place by following acorns (ドングリ), but they can't seem to arrive. They play with their empty pockets, perhaps symbolically indicating they have no means or tokens to guide them. Eventually, they stumble upon the restaurant, which has no reservations and is filled with empty seats during lunchtime. The birds are chirping merrily, adding to the lighthearted atmosphere.

The restaurant has a bright red tin roof, and the menu consists only of the chef's recommendations. The sounds of classical instruments—violin, flute, cello, and viola—are heard coming from the kitchen, suggesting a unique and magical dining experience. The owner warmly welcomes the guests, inviting them to eat until they're full and then rest. They bid farewell to the customers, mentioning that each day is different ("明日は明日で エトセトラ").

The atmosphere becomes even more playful as the dance floor (right to left) fills with joy, and even a bear cub joins in the fun. The menu is listed, featuring various dishes like carpaccio, paella, and hors d'oeuvres, but notably, there's no risotto or dessert. The singer offers to deliver the full course all the way to the grave, implying a once-in-a-lifetime, unforgettable dining experience.

In summary, the lyrics paint a picture of a fantastical forest restaurant where time and reality bend, offering a magical dining adventure filled with music, laughter, and extraordinary cuisine. The mischievous tone and fantastical elements create a dreamlike atmosphere that invites listeners into a world of imagination.
