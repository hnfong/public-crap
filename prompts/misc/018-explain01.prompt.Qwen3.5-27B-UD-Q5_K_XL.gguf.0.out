(Beat drops, bass kicks in)

**Yo, listen up, let me break it down for the crew,**
**We talkin' 'bout the Fed, the big boss of the view.**
**They ain't a gang, they ain't a label, they ain't a street,**
**They run the whole money game, keep the economy sweet.**

**First off, they the bank for the banks, the vault in the sky,**
**When the big shots need cash, they the ones who supply.**
**They print the green, but they don't just drop it on the floor,**
**They control the flow so the whole system don't war.**

**Now, here's the trick, the secret sauce, the real deal,**
**They play with the "Interest Rate," that's the cost of the feel.**
**When they raise the rate, it's like a tax on the loan,**
**Borrowing gets expensive, you better sit on your throne.**
**You stop spending, you stop buying, the heat goes down low,**
**Inflation gets cooled, so the prices don't grow.**

**But when the streets are cold and the money is tight,**
**They drop the rate low, make the cash flow like light.**
**Borrowing gets cheap, yeah, the cost is a dime,**
**You buy a new whip, you build up the time.**
**Spending goes up, the economy wakes from the sleep,**
**Jobs get created, the whole city gets deep.**

**They watch the prices, they watch the jobs, they watch the street,**
**Making sure the whole game stays balanced and neat.**
**Too much heat? They cool it down, turn the faucet off.**
**Too much cold? They turn it on, give the people a lift.**

**They the referees, the refs in the booth,**
**Making sure the whole rap game don't end in a truth.**
**No crash, no bust, just a steady flow,**
**That's the Fed, homie, that's the way that it go.**

**So next time you see the news talkin' 'bout the Fed,**
**Know they the ones keeping the whole world fed.**
**Controlling the cash, keeping the rhythm alive,**
**That's the Federal Reserve, yeah, they keep it alive.**
