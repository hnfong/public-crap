**A) Yes.**
The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius. Since -12 degrees is significantly below this temperature, water will freeze (turn into ice) under standard conditions.

**B) The water will turn into solid ice.**
As the pure water is cooled below 0 degrees Celsius, it reaches its freezing point and undergoes a phase change from a liquid to a solid state. By the time it reaches -12 degrees Celsius, the entire glass will consist of ice. [end of text]
