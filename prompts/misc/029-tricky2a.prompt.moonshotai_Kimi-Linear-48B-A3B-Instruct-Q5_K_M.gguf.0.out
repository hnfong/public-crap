The user asks: "Alice: 'What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?' Bob: 'It freezes.' Alice: 'No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius.' Bob: 'Yes, but I'm still right.' Who is right? Explain briefly."

We need to answer: Who is right? Bob says "Yes, but I'm still right." So we need to evaluate the statements.

Alice says: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" Bob says: "It freezes." Alice says: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius." Bob says: "Yes, but I'm still right."

We need to determine if Bob is right. The question is about what happens to water at -10°C. The answer is that water freezes at 0°C, but at -10°C, water is already frozen (solid). So the statement "It freezes" is ambiguous: does it mean "it will freeze" or "it is freezing"? At -10°C, water is already frozen (if it's pure water). So the correct answer is that water is frozen, not that it will freeze. So Bob's statement "It freezes" is not accurate if interpreted as "it will freeze". However, Bob says "Yes, but I'm still right." He might be interpreting "freezes" as "is frozen". In that case, he is correct: at -10°C, water is frozen. So the question is: is Bob right? The answer depends on interpretation.

We need to explain briefly. The question is likely a logic puzzle: who is right? The answer: Bob is right if we interpret "freezes" as "is frozen". But if we interpret "freezes" as "will freeze", then Alice is right. However, the phrase "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" implies a description of the state. At -10°C, water is frozen (solid). So Bob's answer "It freezes" is correct if we interpret "freezes" as "is frozen". But the phrase "freezes" is ambiguous. The phrase "water freezes at 0°C" is a statement about the freezing point. At -10°C, water is already frozen, so it doesn't freeze further; it's already frozen. So the correct answer is that water is frozen. So Bob is right.

Thus the answer: Bob is right, because at -10°C water is already frozen (solid). The phrase "freezes" can be interpreted as "is frozen". So Bob's statement is correct.

We need to explain briefly. So we can say: Bob is right because at -10°C water is already frozen (solid). The phrase "freezes" can be interpreted as "is frozen". The freezing point is 0°C, but at -10°C water is below its freezing point and thus is frozen.

Thus answer: Bob is right.

We should also note that if we interpret "freezes" as "will freeze", then Alice is right. But the question is ambiguous. However, the typical answer is that Bob is right.

Thus answer: Bob is right.

We can also mention that the phrase "freezes" is ambiguous; but in the context of the question, Bob's answer is correct.

Thus final answer: Bob is right.

Now we need to produce a brief explanation.

We can say: At -10°C water is already frozen (solid), so it does not freeze further; it is frozen. Therefore Bob's statement "It freezes" is correct if interpreted as "is frozen". So Bob is right.

Thus answer: Bob is right.

We can also mention that the freezing point is 0°C, but at -10°C water is below that and is frozen.

Thus answer: Bob is right.

Now we need to output the answer.

We should be concise.

Thus final answer: Bob is right; at -10°C water is already frozen (solid), so it does not freeze further; it is frozen.

We can also mention that the phrase "freezes" can be interpreted as "is frozen". So Bob is correct.

Thus final answer: Bob is right.

Now produce final answer.


**Bob is right.**  

At –10 °C water is already below its freezing point (0 °C) and is therefore solid – it is frozen. The statement “It freezes” can be read as “it is frozen,” which is accurate for –10 °C. If “freezes” were taken to mean “will freeze,” then Alice would be correct, but in the context of describing the state at –10 °C, Bob’s answer is correct. [end of text]
