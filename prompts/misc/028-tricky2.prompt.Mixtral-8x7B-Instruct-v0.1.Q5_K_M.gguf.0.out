Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.
 [/INST] Bob is not entirely right or wrong. While it is true that water begins to freeze as the temperature drops below 0 degrees Celsius, it does not mean that water will always freeze exactly at 0 degrees Celsius. At atmospheric pressure, pure water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (or 32 degrees Fahrenheit), but if impurities are present or the pressure is different, the freezing point can be slightly lower. At -10 degrees Celsius, water is certainly frozen, so Bob's statement that "water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius" is not completely accurate, but it is true that water is frozen at -10 degrees Celsius.

In summary, pure water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure, but water can freeze at slightly lower temperatures depending on conditions. Therefore, both Alice and Bob have made correct statements within their own contexts. [end of text]
