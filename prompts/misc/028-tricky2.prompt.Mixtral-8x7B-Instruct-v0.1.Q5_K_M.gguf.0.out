 Bob is not entirely right or wrong. While it is true that water begins to freeze as the temperature drops below 0 degrees Celsius, it does not mean that water will always freeze exactly at 0 degrees Celsius. At atmospheric pressure, pure water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (or 32 degrees Fahrenheit), but if the pressure is different or if there are impurities in the water, the freezing point can be altered. At -10 degrees Celsius, water can still be in its liquid form, but it is closer to freezing. Therefore, Alice is correct in stating that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under normal conditions.
