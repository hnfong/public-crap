Yo, listen up, here's the deal, son,
Got somethin' called the Fed, lemme get it done.
It's the big boss, the main player, the G,
Controlling the money, you see what I mean?

They print the cash, the greenbacks, the loot,
Decide how much is out there, make the rules.
They got the power, the juice, the control,
Keepin' the economy from goin' too low or too high, yo.

When the economy's slow, they gotta step in,
Lower the interest, make it easy to win.
When it's too hot, they gotta cool it down,
Raise the rates, make it harder to get around.

They watch the jobs, the prices, the whole scene,
Make sure the economy's stayin' clean.
They keep it balanced, keep it stable, keep it real,
So the whole country can keep on dealin', keep on feelin'.

So next time you see the cash in your hand,
Remember the Fed, the big boss, the man.
They run the money, they run the game,
Keepin' the economy from goin' insane. [end of text]
