 In this scenario, Alice wants to kill Orim, Samite Healer with her two copies of Kindle. Let's analyze the optimal play for both players.

**Alice's Optimal Play:**

Alice has two Kindles in her hand, and she needs to deal enough damage to Orim to destroy it. Orim has 3 toughness, so Alice needs to deal at least 3 damage to it. However, since Bob can tap Orim to prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn, Alice needs to deal more than 3 damage in a single instant to ensure Orim's death.

Here's how Alice can calculate the damage needed:

1. The first Kindle will deal 2 damage (base damage) + 2 (number of Kindles in all graveyards, which is 0 at this point) = 4 damage.
2. After casting the first Kindle, there will be 1 Kindle in the graveyard.
3. The second Kindle will deal 2 damage (base damage) + 3 (number of Kindles in all graveyards, which is now 1) = 5 damage.

Alice should cast the first Kindle targeting Orim. If Bob does not respond, Orim will be dealt 4 damage, and then Alice should cast the second Kindle, also targeting Orim. This will deal a total of 9 damage to Orim, ensuring its destruction even if Bob taps it to prevent 3 damage.

**Bob's Optimal Play:**

Bob's only chance to save Orim is to use Orim's ability to prevent damage. However, since Alice is casting instants and Bob's lands are tapped out, Bob cannot cast any spells or activate any abilities in response to the first Kindle because it is an instant and can be cast at any time. Bob must wait until Alice has finished casting her instants before he can respond.

If Alice casts both Kindles back-to-back without giving Bob a chance to respond (by casting them in the same stack without passing priority), Bob cannot use Orim's ability to prevent the damage because he does not have priority to activate the ability until Alice has finished casting her spells and passes priority.

**Outcome:**

If Alice plays optimally by casting both Kindles targeting Orim without passing priority, Orim will be dealt 9 damage in total and will be destroyed. Bob will not have an opportunity to prevent any of this damage because he cannot activate Orim's ability in between the casting of the two Kindles.

**Thought Process:**

Alice's thought process is to maximize the damage output of her Kindles by ensuring that the second Kindle benefits from the first one being in the graveyard. She also needs to be aware of the stack and priority to ensure that Bob cannot interrupt her combo.

Bob's thought process is limited by his lack of mana and options. His only hope is that Alice makes a mistake by passing priority after casting the first Kindle, allowing him to activate Orim's damage prevention ability. However, if Alice plays correctly, Bob has no viable play to save Orim.

In summary, Alice's optimal play is to cast both Kindles in succession without passing priority, dealing a total of 9 damage to Orim and destroying it. Bob has no response to this play given the current game state. [end of text]
