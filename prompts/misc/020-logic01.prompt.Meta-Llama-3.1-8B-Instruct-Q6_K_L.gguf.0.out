If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

In logic and mathematics, a theory that proves itself is often referred to as "tautological" or "self-verifying". This is because a tautology is a statement that is true by definition, and a self-verifying theory is one that can prove its own consistency or truth.

Here are some examples of tautological theories:

1. **Hilbert's Formal System**: In 1928, David Hilbert proposed a formal system for arithmetic, which he claimed was self-verifying. The system was designed to be consistent, and Hilbert believed that it could prove its own consistency. Although Hilbert's program was later shown to be flawed by Gödel's incompleteness theorems, the system itself is still considered a tautological theory.
2. **Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC)**: ZFC is a formal system for set theory that is widely used in mathematics. It is often considered a tautological theory because it can prove its own consistency, assuming the axiom of choice. However, this proof relies on the axiom of choice, which is not a tautology in itself.
3. **Theories of arithmetic with a "truth predicate"**: Some theories of arithmetic, such as those developed by Gödel and Tarski, include a "truth predicate" that allows the theory to talk about its own truth. These theories can prove their own consistency, making them tautological.
4. **The theory of Boolean algebras**: Boolean algebras are a mathematical structure that can be used to model logical operations. The theory of Boolean algebras is tautological because it can prove its own consistency, using the axioms of Boolean algebra.

On the other hand, a theory that is simply consistent, but not self-verifying, is not necessarily tautological. For example:

* **Euclid's Elements**: Euclid's geometry is a consistent theory, but it does not prove its own consistency. It relies on axioms and postulates that are assumed to be true, but not proven within the theory itself.
* **The Peano axioms**: The Peano axioms are a set of axioms for arithmetic that are widely used in mathematics. While they are consistent, they do not prove their own consistency.

In summary, a theory that proves itself is often referred to as tautological, but this requires careful consideration of the theory's axioms and the nature of its proof.
