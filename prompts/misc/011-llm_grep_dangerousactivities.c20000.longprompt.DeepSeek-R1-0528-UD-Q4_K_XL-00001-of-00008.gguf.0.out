We are looking for lines that are "relating to dangerous activities that may get somebody hurt"
 We'll go through each line and see if it obviously matches.

 Steps:
 1. We note that the query is about activities that are dangerous and may cause injury.
 2. We look for lines that mention activities, sports, experiments, or situations that are inherently risky or could lead to physical harm.

   - Line 292: Virtual assistants - not dangerous.

   - Line 309: Fasting experiment - might discuss dangers.
   - Line 311: Refeeding syndromes fasting - refeeding syndrome is a dangerous condition that can occur when refeeding after a fast. So this is about a dangerous activity (fasting) that can lead to harm.

   - Line 325: Vaccine complications - dangerous side effects? But note: the context is about a document comparing risks. The activity (getting vaccinated) can have risks, but the line is about a PDF. We are looking for activities that may get somebody hurt. The PDF is about risks, so it might be relevant? However, the query is about activities that are dangerous. Getting a vaccine is not typically considered a dangerous activity (it's a medical procedure that can have rare side effects). We'll skip because it's not obvious.
   - Line 326: Dangers of fructose and uric acid - health dangers, but not an activity.

   - Line 363: Crafting an Amethyst D20 - involves cutting stone? Could be dangerous if not done safely. But the description is about crafting and then scratching edges. It might involve tools that can cause injury. However, the video is about a crafted object, not necessarily showing dangerous activity. We'll skip because it's not obvious.
   - Line 364: 3D printer that prints high-carbon steel - 3D printing with metal might involve high temperatures and could be dangerous? But the line is just a link. Not obviously about an activity that may get someone hurt.
   - Line 365: Creative code golfing - not dangerous.
   - Line 366: Knife steel types - knives are dangerous, but the line is about information on steel, not an activity.
   - Line 367: Knife sharpener guide - sharpening knives is an activity that can be dangerous (cuts). So this might be relevant? But note: the guide is about how to sharpen, which is a safe activity if done properly. However, it is an activity that may get somebody hurt if done wrong. We'll consider it because the activity (sharpening knives) has inherent risk of injury.
   - Line 368: Best steel kitchen knife - not an activity.
   - Line 369: Cleaver - a knife, but not an activity.
   - Line 370: (中式菜刀) - same.

 Line 548: "## Interesting Things" - not dangerous.
 Line 554: "## Others" - 
   - Line 556: 劳德诺日记（一） - a diary, not dangerous.
   - ... until line 576: hentai - not dangerous.

 Line 579: "## My image links" - not dangerous.

 Line 591: "## Mandelbrot" - not dangerous.
 Line 597: "## Philanthropy" - not dangerous.
 Line 601: "## Travelling" - not dangerous.

 After scanning, the lines that obviously relate to dangerous activities that may get somebody hurt are:

 1. Line 289: "- http://www.trueactivist.com/gab_gallery/how-to-turn-a-beer-can-into-the-only-camping-stove-youll-ever-need/ - Page not found - True Activist"
    - Even though the link is broken, the description is about making a camping stove from a beer can, which involves fire and can be dangerous.

 2. Line 308: "- https://paleoleap.com/long-fasts/ - Long Fasts: Dangerous or Beneficial? | Paleo Leap"
    - Directly discusses the dangers of long fasting.

 3. Line 311: "- https://intensivedietarymanagement.com/refeeding-syndromes-fasting-20/"
    - Refeeding syndrome is a dangerous condition that can occur when refeeding after a fast.

 4. Line 317: "- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2495396/pdf/postmedj00315-0056.pdf Features of a successful therapeutic fast of 382 days' duration"
    - A 382-day fast is an extreme activity that can be dangerous.

 5. Line 339: "- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39947530 - The Horror Story of the Shaken Baby Syndrome"
    - Shaking a baby is a dangerous activity that causes harm.

 6. Line 367: "- https://www.knifeplanet.net/best-knife-sharpener-professional-guide/"
    - Knife sharpening is an activity that can lead to cuts and injuries.

 However, note that for line 289 the link is broken and the description is about a camping stove. We are to output the line as is.

 But wait: the query says "only trigger when the input obviously matches the query". We must be cautious.

 Let's reexamine:

 - Line 289: The activity (making a camping stove from a beer can) is inherently dangerous because it involves fire and pressurized containers? But note: the description says "Page not found". However, the original intent of the link was about a dangerous activity. We'll include it.

 - Line 308, 311, 317: All about fasting and its dangers -> dangerous activity (fasting) that may get somebody hurt.

 - Line 339: Shaken Baby Syndrome -> the activity (shaking a baby) is dangerous and causes harm.

 - Line 367: Knife sharpening -> an activity that can cause cuts. It is a common activity that can be dangerous if not done carefully.

 We'll output these lines.

 However, note that the query says "relating to dangerous activities that may get somebody hurt". We are not including every health risk, but activities that are inherently risky.

 Also note: we are to output the line number and the line, then "---".

 Format:
   [line number]:[line content]
   ---

 But note: the input has line numbers at the beginning of each line. We are to output the line as it appears (with the line number prefix) and then the separator.

 However, the instruction says: "output the line (together with line number)" and the input already has line numbers. So we can output the line exactly as it appears in the input (with the line number and the content) and then "---".

 Example:
   289:- http://www.trueactivist.com/gab_gallery/how-to-turn-a-beer-can-into-the-only-camping-stove-youll-ever-need/ - Page not found - True Activist
   ---

 But note: the input has the line numbers as part of the text? Actually, the input is:

   1:# Other bookmarks
   2:
   ...

 So we output the entire line including the number and colon.

 However, the input has the line numbers as:

   [number]:[content]

 We'll output:

   [number]:[content]
   ---

 for each matching line.

 Let's list the matching lines:

   289:- http://www.trueactivist.com/gab_gallery/how-to-turn-a-beer-can-into-the-only-camping-stove-youll-ever-need/ - Page not found - True Activist
   308:- https://paleoleap.com/long-fasts/ - Long Fasts: Dangerous or Beneficial? | Paleo Leap
   311:- https://intensivedietarymanagement.com/refeeding-syndromes-fasting-20/
   317:- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2495396/pdf/postmedj00315-0056.pdf Features of a successful therapeutic fast of 382 days' duration
   339:- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39947530 - The Horror Story of the Shaken Baby Syndrome
   367:- https://www.knifeplanet.net/best-knife-sharpener-professional-guide/

 But note: line 311 does not have a description? It's just the URL. But that's the line.

 However, we must be cautious: the query says "only trigger when the input obviously matches". For line 311, the URL has "refeeding-syndromes-fasting", which is about a dangerous syndrome from fasting. So it's about a dangerous activity (fasting) that may lead to harm.

 We'll output these 6 lines.

 But wait: what about line 309? It's about a fasting experiment. However, the description doesn't explicitly say "dangerous". We are only including when it's obvious. The ones that have "dangerous" or "syndrome" or "horror story" are more obvious.

 Similarly, line 318 is a lecture on fasting for survival, which might imply dangers, but it's not as explicit as the ones we have.

 Therefore, we stick to the 6 lines.

 However, note that line 289 is broken and the content is "Page not found". But the original intent was a dangerous activity. We'll include it because the description in the input (before the link) was about turning a beer can into a camping stove.

 But the input for line 289 is:

   289:- http://www.trueactivist.com/gab_gallery/how-to-turn-a-beer-can-into-the-only-camping-stove-youll-ever-need/ - Page not found - True Activist

 The description part says "Page not found", but the URL and the initial part of the description indicate the dangerous activity.

 We'll output:

   289:- http://www.trueactivist.com/gab_gallery/how-to-turn-a-beer-can-into-the-only-camping-stove-youll-ever-need/ - Page not found - True Activist
   ---
   308:- https://paleoleap.com/long-fasts/ - Long Fasts: Dangerous or Beneficial? | Paleo Leap
   ---
   311:- https://intensivedietarymanagement.com/refeeding-syndromes-fasting-20/
   ---
   317:- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2495396/pdf/postmedj00315-0056.pdf Features of a successful therapeutic fast of 382 days' duration
   ---
   339:- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39947530 - The Horror Story of the Shaken Baby Syndrome
   ---
   367:- https://www.knifeplanet.net/best-knife-sharpener-professional-guide/
   ---

 But note: the input has a line 340 about aphantasia? We skipped that.

 We are confident that these are the only obvious matches.

 However, let's double-check for any other lines that might be about dangerous activities:

  - Line 518: https://www.youtube.com/@Nighthawkinlight/ - Fun and dangerous experiments
    This is in the "Interesting but distracting channels" section. The channel description says "Fun and dangerous experiments". So the channel is about dangerous activities. But note: the line is just a link to a channel, not a specific activity. The query is about the line having something that matches. The line says "Fun and dangerous experiments". So it does relate to dangerous activities.

    We should include line 518.

  - Line 518: https://www.youtube.com/@Nighthawkinlight/ - Fun and dangerous experiments

  So now we have 7 lines.

  Also, note line 518 is in the input as:

      518:- https://www.youtube.com/@Nighthawkinlight/ - Fun and dangerous experiments

  We'll add that.

  Therefore, the final list:

    289:- http://www.trueactivist.com/gab_gallery/how-to-turn-a-beer-can-into-the-only-camping-stove-youll-ever-need/ - Page not found - True Activist
    308:- https://paleoleap.com/long-fasts/ - Long Fasts: Dangerous or Beneficial? | Paleo Leap
    311:- https://intensivedietarymanagement.com/refeeding-syndromes-fasting-20/
    317:- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2495396/pdf/postmedj00315-0056.pdf Features of a successful therapeutic fast of 382 days' duration
    339:- https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39947530 - The Horror Story of the Shaken Baby Syndrome
    367:- https://www.knifeplanet.net/best-knife-sharpener-professional-guide/
    518:- https://www.youtube.com/@Nighthawkinlight/ - Fun and dangerous experiments

  We output each of these lines followed by "---".

  Note: The input has 611 lines. We are only outputting the matching ones.

  Let's write the output accordingly.
