I have written a fan fiction based on World of Warcraft characters. I saved the file into wowfanfic.txt

What is a probable output if I run this Linux command?

$ cat wowfanfic.txt | perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }' | sort |  uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 20

Explain your answer with respect to basic linguistic principles.

The given Linux command pipeline processes the text file `wowfanfic.txt` and provides a frequency count of unique words, sorted in ascending order, and displays the top 20 most frequent words. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **cat wowfanfic.txt**: Displays the content of the file.
2. **perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'**: This Perl one-liner reads the input line by line, splits each line into words using whitespace as the delimiter, and prints each word on a new line. It effectively tokenizes the text.
3. **sort**: Sorts the words alphabetically.
4. **uniq -c**: Counts the occurrences of each word and prefixes the count to the word.
5. **sort -n**: Sorts the words by their counts in ascending numerical order.
6. **tail -n 20**: Displays the last 20 lines, which correspond to the 20 most frequent words.

The output will look something like this:

```
     5 and
     5 the
     5 to
     5 of
     5 a
     5 in
     5 that
     5 with
     5 his
     5 was
     5 he
     5 for
     5 not
     5 on
     5 at
     5 but
     5 by
     5 this
     5 they
```

This output adheres to basic linguistic principles, as it provides a frequency distribution of words in the text, which can help identify common words, phrases, or patterns in the fan fiction. The most frequent words are typically function words (e.g., 'and', 'the', 'to', 'of') and pronouns (e.g., 'a', 'his', 'he', 'they'), which are common in English language texts.
