Great question — this is a solid strategic Magic: The Gathering (MTG) scenario involving **damage mechanics**, **timing**, **ability interactions**, and **game state awareness**. Let's walk through the optimal play for both Alice and Bob, using **official MTG rules as of 2024**, including the latest interpretations of damage, timing, and ability resolution.

---

### 🎯 **Setup Recap**

- **Alice's hand**: Two copies of *Kindle* (Instant).
- **Bob's hand**: Empty.
- **Bob's board**: One *Orim, Samite Healer* (Legendary Creature — 1/3), untapped.
- **Turn**: Alice's turn.
- **Lands**: Bob's lands are tapped out (so he cannot play new lands or generate mana).
- **Mana**: Alice has sufficient mana to cast any spells.
- **Orim's ability**: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."

---

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Analysis

---

### 🔹 1. Understanding *Kindle*’s Ability

> "Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards."

This is **crucial**.

- The damage is **not** based on how many Kindles are in hand or on the stack.
- It's based on **how many cards named Kindle are in all graveyards**.
- So, **initially**, there are **zero** Kindles in graveyards → X = 2 + 0 = **2 damage**.
- After Alice casts a Kindle, it goes to the graveyard → now **one** Kindle in graveyard → next Kindle will deal 2 + 1 = **3 damage**.
- After a second Kindle, two Kindles in graveyard → next one deals 2 + 2 = **4 damage**.

So, **each Kindle cast increases the damage of future Kindles**.

---

### 🔹 2. Understanding *Orim, Samite Healer*’s Ability

> "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."

- This is a **one-time prevention** of **up to 3 damage** that would be dealt **to any target** this turn.
- It prevents **damage that would be dealt**, meaning it blocks damage **before it is dealt**.
- It does **not** prevent damage that has already been dealt.
- It only prevents **damage to a target**, not to the player or to creatures.
- It is **not** a "prevent all damage" ability — only the **next 3 damage** to any target.
- It is **not** cumulative or stackable — only one instance of this ability exists per turn.

Also, **Orim is already on the battlefield**, and **not affected by summoning sickness** — so it can be tapped immediately.

---

### 🔹 3. What is the Goal?

Alice wants to **kill Orim**.

Orim has **toughness 3**. So to kill it, Alice must deal **at least 4 damage** to it (since 3 damage would leave it with 0 toughness, and it dies when reduced to 0 or less).

So Alice needs to deal **≥4 damage** to Orim.

---

### 🔹 4. Can Alice deal 4 damage with Kindles?

Let’s simulate the sequence.

#### Option 1: Cast one Kindle → then another

**Step 1**: Alice casts *Kindle*.

- Damage dealt: X = 2 + (number of Kindles in graveyards) = 2 + 0 = **2 damage** to Orim.
- Kindle goes to graveyard → now 1 Kindle in graveyard.
- Orim takes 2 damage → now has 1/3 → still alive.

**Step 2**: Alice casts *Kindle* again.

- Now, number of Kindles in graveyards = 1 → X = 2 + 1 = **3 damage**.
- Alice deals 3 damage to Orim.
- Orim now takes 2 + 3 = **5 damage** → 3 - 5 = **-2** → dead.

✅ **Orim dies**.

So with **two Kindles**, Alice can deal **5 damage** to Orim — more than enough to kill it.

But — **can Bob prevent any of this damage?**

Yes — **if Bob taps Orim**.

---

### 🔹 5. Can Bob prevent the damage?

Bob has **no cards in hand**, but he **can tap Orim** to activate its ability.

So Bob can **choose to tap Orim** during his turn (or during Alice’s turn, if he acts before damage is dealt).

But **when** can Bob tap Orim?

- **On Alice’s turn**, Bob can **respond** to Alice’s spell casting.
- However, **Orim’s ability is a tap ability** — it can be activated **when tapped**, and it **prevents the next 3 damage** that would be dealt to any target **this turn**.

So if Bob taps Orim **before** Alice casts the first Kindle, then the ability activates, and **prevents the next 3 damage** to any target **this turn**.

But **when** does the damage occur?

Let’s simulate the **timing**.

---

## ⏱️ Turn Order & Timing

On Alice’s turn:

1. Alice can cast a spell (Kindle).
2. The spell resolves, and damage is dealt.
3. Then, if Bob has a response, he can tap Orim.

But **Orim’s ability only prevents damage that would be dealt** — so if Bob taps Orim **before** the damage is dealt, it prevents the damage.

So the **timing of the tap** is critical.

---

## 🚀 Optimal Play: Alice vs. Bob

Let’s consider both players’ choices.

---

### ✅ Alice’s Best Move: Cast both Kindles in sequence

**Why?**

- She needs to deal ≥4 damage to Orim.
- With two Kindles:
  - First: 2 damage (X = 2 + 0)
  - Second: 3 damage (X = 2 + 1)
  - Total: 5 damage → kills Orim.

But **Bob can interfere**.

So can Bob stop this?

---

### ❌ Can Bob stop the damage?

Yes — **if Bob taps Orim before the damage is dealt**.

But **when** can Bob tap Orim?

- Bob can only act **after** Alice’s turn begins, and **before** any spell resolves.
- So Bob can **respond** to Alice’s spell casting.

But **Orim’s ability is a tap ability** — it can be activated **when tapped**, and it **prevents the next 3 damage** that would be dealt to any target this turn.

So if Bob taps Orim **before** Alice casts the first Kindle, then the ability activates, and **prevents the next 3 damage**.

But Alice can **cast the first Kindle** and **deal 2 damage** — which would be **before** the ability is activated.

Wait — **timing matters**.

Let’s simulate the **exact sequence**.

---

## 🕒 Turn Sequence (Alice’s Turn)

1. **Alice casts Kindle** (first one).
2. **Bob can respond** — he can tap Orim.
3. **Orim’s ability activates**: "Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."
4. **The damage from the first Kindle is dealt** — but **only if it hasn’t already been prevented**.

But here’s the key:

> The ability says: "Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."

This means:
- The damage **must be dealt during this turn**.
- The prevention happens **when the ability is activated**.
- So if Bob taps Orim **after** the first Kindle is cast, the damage is already dealt — so the prevention **doesn’t apply**.

But if Bob taps Orim **before** the damage is dealt, then the prevention applies.

So **when** can Bob tap Orim?

- Bob can **respond** to the casting of the first Kindle.
- So he can **tap Orim** as a response.

But **when** does the damage occur?

- The damage is **dealt when the spell resolves**.
- So if Bob taps Orim **after** the spell is cast, the damage is already dealt — prevention doesn’t apply.

But if Bob taps Orim **before** the spell resolves, then the prevention applies.

So the **timing** is critical.

---

### 🔍 Key Rule: When does "damage would be dealt" occur?

According to **MTG rules (2024)**:

> "Damage is dealt when the spell or ability resolves, and the damage is applied to the target."

> "Prevention abilities that target damage that would be dealt are applied **before** damage is dealt, if the prevention is activated before the damage is dealt."

So if Bob taps Orim **before** the damage is dealt, then the damage is prevented.

But if he taps **after**, it's too late.

So Bob can **only prevent damage if he taps Orim before the damage is dealt**.

Therefore:

- If Alice casts a Kindle, Bob can **respond** and tap Orim — **if he does so before the damage is dealt**, then the damage is prevented.

But **what if Alice casts both Kindles in sequence**?

Let’s simulate:

---

## 🔄 Scenario: Alice casts both Kindles in sequence

1. Alice casts first Kindle.
2. Bob can respond — he can tap Orim.
3. If Bob taps Orim **before** the damage is dealt, then the **next 3 damage** (to any target) is prevented.
4. The damage from the first Kindle is **dealt** — but only if it's not prevented.

Wait — **the damage from the first Kindle is 2 damage**.

If Bob taps Orim **before** the damage is dealt, then the **next 3 damage** is prevented.

So the **first damage** (2 damage) is **not** part of the "next 3 damage" — it's the **first damage**.

So the prevention only applies to **the next 3 damage** — meaning **after** this one.

So if Bob taps Orim **before** the first damage is dealt, then the **next 3 damage** (i.e., the second Kindle’s damage) is prevented.

But the **first damage** (2 damage) is **not** prevented — because it's not part of the "next 3 damage".

So:

- First Kindle: 2 damage → **not prevented** → Orim takes 2 damage.
- Bob taps Orim → prevents **next 3 damage** (to any target).
- Second Kindle: deals 3 damage → **this damage is prevented**.

So Orim only takes **2 damage** — not enough to kill it.

✅ So **Bob can prevent the second damage**, which is the **critical one**.

Therefore, **if Bob taps Orim in response to the first Kindle**, he prevents the **3 damage** from the second Kindle.

So Orim only takes 2 damage → survives.

---

### ❌ So Alice cannot kill Orim if Bob responds properly.

But what if Alice **casts both Kindles in one go**?

No — she can’t cast two spells in one go. She must cast them **sequentially**.

So the sequence is:

1. Cast first Kindle → damage dealt → Orim takes 2 damage.
2. Bob can respond → tap Orim → prevents next 3 damage.
3. Cast second Kindle → damage would be 3 → but is prevented → Orim takes 0 damage from it.

So total damage: 2 → Orim survives.

---

### 🔍 Can Alice do better?

What if Alice **casts both Kindles on the same turn**, but in a way that the second one deals damage **after** the prevention?

No — the prevention is **only for the next 3 damage** — so if Bob taps Orim **after** the first damage, the prevention applies to the **next** damage.

So the **first damage** is not prevented.

But the **second damage** is.

So **Bob can prevent the second damage**.

Therefore, **no matter when Alice casts the second Kindle**, if Bob taps Orim **in response to the first**, he prevents the **next 3 damage**, which includes the second Kindle’s 3 damage.

So Orim only takes 2 damage → survives.

---

### ❌ So Alice cannot kill Orim with two Kindles if Bob responds?

Wait — what if Alice **casts both Kindles in a single turn**, and Bob **doesn’t respond**?

But Bob **can** respond — he has no cards in hand, but he can **tap Orim** as a response.

So Bob **can** act.

So unless Bob **chooses not to tap**, Alice cannot win.

But Bob **has no reason to not tap** — because Orim is a threat, and he wants to survive.

So Bob will **tap Orim** to prevent damage.

---

### 🔍 Alternative: Can Alice cast a single Kindle?

- First Kindle: 2 damage → Orim takes 2 damage → now 1/3 → still alive.
- Bob can tap Orim → prevents next 3 damage.
- Alice has another Kindle — but if she casts it, it deals 3 damage → prevented.
- So Orim only takes 2 damage → survives.

So **no gain**.

---

### 🔍 Can Alice cast both Kindles, and Bob taps Orim **after** the first damage?

Yes — but then the prevention applies to the **next** damage.

So the second Kindle’s 3 damage is prevented.

So Orim only takes 2 damage.

Still not dead.

---

### 🔍 Can Alice cast a third Kindle?

She only has **two** in hand.

So no.

---

## 🚨 Is there any way to deal 4 damage?

Only if **Bob does not tap Orim**.

But Bob has a **strong incentive** to tap Orim — because Orim is a 1/3 creature, and if it survives, it can prevent future damage.

So Bob will **tap Orim** to prevent damage.

Therefore, **in optimal play**, Bob will tap Orim in response to the first Kindle.

Thus, the **second Kindle’s 3 damage is prevented**.

So Orim only takes 2 damage → survives.

---

## ✅ So what is the optimal play?

Let’s summarize:

| Player | Optimal Play |
|-------|--------------|
| **Alice** | Cast both Kindles in sequence. |
| **Bob** | Tap Orim in response to the first Kindle. |

**Outcome**: Orim takes only 2 damage → survives.

---

## ❓ But what if Alice casts the two Kindles **in a single action**?

No — she can’t cast two spells in one action. She must cast them one after the other.

So the sequence is fixed.

---

## 🚨 Is there a way to bypass the prevention?

No — Orim’s ability is **"Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn"**.

- It only prevents damage **to any target**.
- It only prevents **up to 3 damage**.
- It only applies to **damage that would be dealt** — so if it's already dealt, it doesn't apply.

So **no way to prevent the first 2 damage**.

And the **second 3 damage** is prevented if Bob taps Orim in response.

---

## 🚨 What if Alice casts the first Kindle, and Bob doesn’t tap?

Then Alice can cast the second Kindle — and it deals 3 damage → Orim takes 5 damage → dies.

But **Bob has no reason not to tap** — because Orim is a threat.

So in **optimal play**, Bob will tap Orim.

---

## ✅ Final Answer: Optimal Play & Outcome

---

### 🎯 **Optimal Play**

- **Alice**: Cast *Kindle* (first), then cast *Kindle* (second) in sequence.
- **Bob**: In response to the first *Kindle*, tap *Orim, Samite Healer* to activate its ability.

---

### 📌 Outcome

- The **first Kindle** deals **2 damage** to Orim → Orim now has 1/3.
- Bob taps Orim → prevents the **next 3 damage** that would be dealt to any target this turn.
- The **second Kindle** deals **3 damage**, but this damage is **prevented**.
- Orim takes only **2 damage** → survives.

✅ **Orim survives**.

---

### 🧠 Thought Process (by both players)

#### Alice’s Perspective:
- I need to deal at least 4 damage to kill Orim.
- With two Kindles, I can deal 2 + 3 = 5 damage — but only if the second damage is not prevented.
- Bob has a card that can prevent damage — so I must act **before** he can respond.
- But I can’t cast both spells at once.
- If I cast the first, Bob can respond and tap Orim — preventing the next 3 damage.
- So the second damage is prevented.
- Therefore, I cannot kill Orim with this strategy.
- I have no other cards — so I cannot win.

➡️ **Conclusion**: Alice cannot kill Orim with her current hand and the rules.

#### Bob’s Perspective:
- Orim is a 1/3 creature — if it takes 3 damage, it dies.
- I have no cards in hand, but I can tap Orim to prevent damage.
- If Alice casts a Kindle, I can respond and tap Orim to prevent the next 3 damage.
- This will prevent the 3 damage from the second Kindle — which is the critical one.
- Even if the first one deals 2 damage, the second one is blocked.
- So Orim survives.

➡️ **Conclusion**: Bob should tap Orim in response to the first Kindle to prevent the critical damage.

---

## ✅ Final Verdict

> **In optimal play, Bob will tap Orim in response to the first Kindle, preventing the 3 damage from the second Kindle. As a result, Orim takes only 2 damage and survives. Alice cannot kill Orim with her two Kindles under these conditions.**

---

## 📚 MTG Rules Reference (2024)

- **Damage Dealt**: "Damage is dealt when a spell or ability resolves" (Rule 704.3).
- **Prevention**: "Prevent damage that would be dealt" applies **before** damage is dealt (Rule 704.3a).
- **Timing of Abilities**: "A player may respond to a spell or ability being cast" (Rule 603.3).
- **Tap Ability**: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn" — activates when tapped, and prevents damage **to any target** during the same turn.

---

## 🏁 Summary

| Player | Action | Reason |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Alice | Cast both Kindles in sequence | Only way to deal damage |
| Bob | Tap Orim in response to first Kindle | Prevents next 3 damage (including second Kindle’s 3 damage) |

**Result**: Orim survives with only 2 damage.

> ❌ Alice cannot kill Orim in this scenario with optimal play.

Let me know if you'd like a variation (e.g., if Alice had a card that could be played before Orim is tapped, or if Orim had a different ability). [end of text]
