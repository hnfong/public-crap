The lyrics tell a whimsical, fantastical story set in a magical forest where a mysterious, seemingly impossible restaurant exists. Here's the interpretation:

### Setting:
The story takes place in a small, hidden restaurant deep in the forest. The restaurant is described as being elusive, as one cannot reach it by following acorns (ドングリを辿っても着きません). Despite its obscurity, the restaurant is always open, even when there are no reservations (予約は一つもありません), and it is often empty during lunchtime (空席だらけのランチ時). The restaurant has a whimsical, almost surreal atmosphere, with birds flapping their wings and laughing (小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる), and the building itself has a bright red tin roof (真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根).

### The Restaurant:
The menu is limited to only the chef's recommendations (メニューはおすすめ そればかり), and the kitchen is alive with the sounds of musical instruments like violin, flute, cello, and viola (バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ), suggesting a lively, almost theatrical atmosphere. The restaurant's staff welcomes guests with a playful tone (ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい), inviting them to eat heartily and then fall asleep (たらふく食べたらお眠りよ). The farewell is equally whimsical, with the promise that tomorrow will bring more of the same (明日は明日で エトセトラ).

### The Guests:
The guests at the restaurant are lively and carefree, dancing from right to left (右から左へおおわらわ), and even a pet bear joins in the dancing (手乗りの子熊も踊り出す). The menu includes dishes like carpaccio, paella, and appetizers (カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル), but there is no dessert (リゾット デザートはありません). The restaurant's final course is described as the "last full course" (今宵は最後のフルコース), suggesting a sense of finality or perhaps a farewell to the guests.

### The Twist:
The final line hints at a darker, more fantastical twist: the restaurant's food is said to reach even those in the afterlife (お墓の中まで届けましょう). This suggests that the restaurant is not just a regular eatery but something otherworldly, perhaps a place where the living and the dead can interact, or a liminal space between life and death.

### Interpretation:
The story is a fantastical tale of a magical restaurant that exists in a liminal space, perhaps between the living world and the afterlife. The restaurant is elusive, whimsical, and filled with music and laughter, but it also has a mysterious, almost haunting quality, as it promises to serve food to those who have passed away. The guests are carefree and joyful, but the restaurant's true nature is revealed in the final line, suggesting that it is a place where the boundaries between life and death are blurred.

In a literal sense, this could be interpreted as a fantastical setting where the restaurant is a magical, otherworldly place that serves as a meeting point for the living and the dead, or as a metaphor for the fleeting nature of life and the inevitability of death. The lighthearted, mischievous melody contrasts with the deeper, more poignant themes of the lyrics, creating a sense of wonder and mystery. [end of text]
