Yo, check it, peep this beat,  
The Fed's the vault where the money meet.  
They ain't rappin', they the gatekeepers,  
Control the flow, keep the economy leapers.  

They the ones with the big ol' key,  
To the vault where the cash be.  
Not the streets, not the trap,  
But the big banks, the ones with the stacks.  

They set the rate, like the tempo,  
Make the loans flow, make the economy go.  
Inflation high? They crank the brake,  
Make the money tight, make the prices break.  

Recession knockin'? They drop the beat,  
Lower the rate, make the money cheap.  
They the puppet masters, but not for show,  
They the ones who make the economy flow.  

So when you see the Fed, don't front,  
They the ones who keep the money hunt.  
Not the block, not the corner store,  
But the big game, the economy's core.  

They the ones with the mic in hand,  
Control the beat across the land.  
So respect the Fed, don't diss their role,  
They the ones who keep the money whole. [end of text]
