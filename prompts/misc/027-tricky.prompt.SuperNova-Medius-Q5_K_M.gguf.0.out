A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of pure water is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. At -12 degrees Celsius, water would be in its liquid state, not frozen.

B) If you have a glass of pure water and cool it down to -12 degrees Celsius, the water will remain in its liquid state. However, it will be very close to its freezing point, and the water molecules will be moving very slowly. If the water is pure and the conditions are ideal, it might be possible for the water to supercool, meaning it would remain liquid even below its normal freezing point. But at -12 degrees Celsius, it is unlikely to supercool significantly, and the water will be very cold and close to freezing. If any impurities or disturbances are present, the water could begin to crystallize and freeze. [end of text]
