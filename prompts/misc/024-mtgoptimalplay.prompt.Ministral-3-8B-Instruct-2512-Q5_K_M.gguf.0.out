In this scenario, we have a high-stakes moment where Alice wants to eliminate Orim, Samite Healer, which is a significant threat to her burn strategy. Let's break down the optimal plays for both players step by step, considering the rules and mechanics of *Magic: The Gathering* as of 2024.

### **Alice's Perspective: Killing Orim**
Alice has two copies of **Kindle** in her hand. Kindle is an instant that deals damage equal to 2 plus the number of Kindles in all graveyards. Since she has no Kindles in her graveyard yet, each Kindle will deal 2 damage.

#### **Alice's Options:**
1. **Cast one Kindle:**
   - She can cast one Kindle, dealing 2 damage to Orim (since Orim is untapped and has no protection).
   - Orim's ability: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."
     - Since Alice is dealing only 2 damage, Orim's ability doesn't trigger (because the damage is less than 3).
   - Outcome: Orim takes 2 damage (now at 1/3), and Alice has one Kindle left in hand.
   - Bob's turn: Orim can tap to prevent future damage, but Alice can still deal more damage next turn.

2. **Cast both Kindles in the same turn:**
   - Alice can cast both Kindles in response to each other (since instants can be cast in response to other instants).
     - First Kindle deals 2 damage to Orim (Orim's ability doesn't trigger because it's less than 3).
     - Second Kindle deals another 2 damage to Orim (total 4 damage).
     - Orim's ability triggers on the second Kindle because the cumulative damage (4) exceeds 3. Orim taps to prevent the next 3 damage, but the 4th damage is already dealt.
     - Outcome: Orim takes 4 damage (now at -3/3, which kills it because its toughness is 3).
   - Alice's graveyard now has two Kindles, so if she casts another Kindle later, it would deal 2 + 2 = 4 damage.

3. **Alternative: Cast one Kindle, then another Kindle next turn:**
   - This is less efficient because Orim can tap to prevent damage on the second Kindle if Alice waits.

#### **Optimal Play for Alice:**
Alice should **cast both Kindles in the same turn** to kill Orim efficiently. Here's how:
   - Alice casts the first Kindle, dealing 2 damage to Orim (Orim's ability doesn't trigger).
   - Alice casts the second Kindle in response, dealing another 2 damage (total 4 damage).
   - Orim's ability triggers on the second Kindle, but the damage is already dealt. Orim dies at -3/3.

### **Bob's Perspective: Protecting Orim**
Bob's goal is to prevent Alice from killing Orim. His only tool is Orim's ability, which can prevent the next 3 damage dealt to any target this turn.

#### **Bob's Options:**
1. **Do nothing:**
   - If Bob doesn't tap Orim, Alice can cast both Kindles in the same turn and kill Orim (as above).
   - Orim dies at -3/3.

2. **Tap Orim before Alice casts the first Kindle:**
   - If Bob taps Orim before Alice plays, Orim's ability triggers immediately (since it's a tap ability). However, tapping Orim doesn't prevent damage unless Alice deals damage while Orim is tapped.
   - Alice can still cast both Kindles in response to each other, dealing 4 damage. Orim's ability would prevent the next 3 damage, but the 4th damage is already dealt, so Orim dies.
   - This doesn't help Bob because Orim's ability is already triggered and can't be used to prevent the initial damage.

3. **Tap Orim after the first Kindle but before the second:**
   - Alice casts the first Kindle, dealing 2 damage to Orim (Orim's ability doesn't trigger because it's less than 3).
   - Bob taps Orim, activating its ability to prevent the next 3 damage.
   - Alice casts the second Kindle, dealing 2 more damage (total 4). Orim's ability prevents the next 3 damage, but the 4th damage is already dealt, so Orim dies.
   - This is the same outcome as above.

#### **Optimal Play for Bob:**
Bob cannot prevent Orim from dying in this scenario because Alice can deal 4 damage in a single turn (by casting both Kindles in response to each other), and Orim's ability can only prevent 3 damage. The 4th damage is unavoidable.

---

### **Outcome:**
- Alice casts both Kindles in response to each other, dealing 4 damage to Orim.
- Orim's ability triggers on the second Kindle, preventing the next 3 damage, but the 4th damage is already dealt.
- Orim dies at -3/3.
- Alice wins the game (or at least removes the threat of Orim).

---

### **Thought Process Summary:**
1. **Alice's Goal:** Kill Orim as quickly as possible to prevent it from blocking future burn spells.
   - She realizes that casting both Kindles in the same turn is the most efficient way to deal enough damage to kill Orim despite Orim's ability.

2. **Bob's Goal:** Protect Orim from Alice's burn spells.
   - He realizes that Orim's ability can only prevent 3 damage per turn, but Alice can deal 4 damage in a single turn by casting both Kindles in response to each other.
   - There's no way to prevent Orim from dying in this scenario.

3. **Game Mechanics:**
   - Instants can be cast in response to other instants (unless otherwise restricted).
   - Orim's ability is a tap ability that triggers when Orim is tapped, and it prevents the next 3 damage dealt to any target this turn.
   - Damage is dealt simultaneously when multiple instants resolve in the same turn.

---

### **Final Answer:**
Alice's optimal play is to cast both Kindles in response to each other, dealing 4 damage to Orim. Orim's ability can only prevent 3 damage, so Orim dies at -3/3. Bob cannot prevent this outcome with Orim's current ability. Alice wins the game by eliminating the threat. [end of text]
