Let's analyze the conversation:

- Alice asks what happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius.
- Bob says, "Water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius." This is incorrect because water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard conditions. At -10°C, water is already frozen (it is ice).
- Alice correctly points out that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.
- Bob insists he is still right, but he is not.

Bob's statement is wrong because water does not freeze at -10°C; it freezes at 0°C. At -10°C, water is below freezing and would be in a solid state (ice), but the freezing process occurs at 0°C (assuming standard pressure and pure water). 

Therefore, Alice is right, and Bob is wrong. Bob might be confusing the temperature at which water is frozen (which can be below 0°C due to supercooling or other factors) with the freezing point, which is defined as 0°C for water under normal conditions. However, even considering supercooling, water freezes at 0°C unless disturbed; it can remain liquid below 0°C only in specific conditions, but the freezing point is still 0°C.

In summary: Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0°C, not at -10°C. At -10°C, water is already frozen. [end of text]
