If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

When a theory proves itself, it is called "consistent" if it does not lead to a contradiction. If a theory proves itself, it is called "tautological" if it does not lead to any contradictions or paradoxes. 

Examples of such theories include:

1. **Axioms**: The axioms of a theory are statements that are assumed to be true without proof. If a theory proves itself, it is a tautology because it does not lead to any contradictions.

2. **Logic Frameworks**: Logic frameworks are formal systems that are used to reason about logical propositions. If a logic framework proves itself, it is a tautology because it does not lead to any contradictions.

3. **Theories of Mathematics**: Theories of mathematics are formal systems used to reason about mathematical propositions. If a theory of mathematics proves itself, it is a tautology because it does not lead to any contradictions.

4. **Theories of Physics**: Theories of physics are formal systems used to reason about physical propositions. If a theory of physics proves itself, it is a tautology because it does not lead to any contradictions.

In all these cases, the theory proves itself without leading to any contradictions, making it a tautology. [end of text]
