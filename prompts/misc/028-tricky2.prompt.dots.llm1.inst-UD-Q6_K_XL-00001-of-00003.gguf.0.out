Bob is incorrect in this context. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm). At -10 degrees Celsius, water would already be in its solid state (ice) unless additional factors like pressure or impurities are involved. 

Bob's statement that "water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius" is misleading because it implies that water is freezing at that temperature, whereas in reality, it is already frozen. Alice is correct that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius. 

However, Bob's second statement ("Yes, but I'm still right") is contradictory and doesn't clarify his point. If he meant that water can remain liquid at -10°C under certain conditions (e.g., supercooling or high pressure), he should have specified those conditions. Under normal circumstances, Alice is correct. 

**Final Answer:** Alice is right; water freezes at 0°C, not -10°C under standard conditions. Bob's statement is incorrect unless unusual conditions are specified. [end of text]
