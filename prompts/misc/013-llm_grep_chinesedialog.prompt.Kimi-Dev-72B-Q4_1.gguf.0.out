◁think▷Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to find lines in the input that contain dialog or spoken text. The input is in Chinese, so I need to look for lines where characters are speaking.

First, I'll look through each line and check if there's any quoted speech. In Chinese, dialogue is often enclosed in double quotes (「」) or sometimes single quotes. Let me check the lines one by one.

Line 4 has「轟隆！」which is a sound effect, not dialog. Line 8 has「啊～！」and then some speech in quotes:「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」So that's a line with spoken text. Line 12 has「轟隆！」again, which is a sound, not dialog. Line 27 has「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」which is definitely dialog. Line 29 has the black-clothed person speaking:「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」Line 39 has「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」Line 41 has an exclamation but maybe not dialog. Line 43 has the narrator speaking:「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」Line 48 has a confused response:「？？？」which might be considered dialog. Line 50 has「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」which is dialog.

So the lines with dialog are 8, 27, 29, 39, 43, 48, and 50. I need to list these lines along with their numbers, separated by "---".

Wait, let me double-check. Line 8 has the old man speaking. Line 27 is the protagonist speaking. Line 29 is the attacker. Line 39 is a question. Line 43 is a slow statement. Line 48 is a confused reaction. Line 50 is the final line of dialog. Those are the ones. So the output should list each of these lines with their numbers, each followed by "---".

8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」

27:「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」
---
29:「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。難怪我同佢對打可以力拔山河。平時我邊有咁大力？佢口裡強硬，卻一個翻身跳出牆外，似乎想逃走。

39:「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 我抑壓心抵嘅震驚，若無其事咁問。
---
43:我望住呢個嚟刺殺我嘅黑衣女人，定睛細看，確定咗我心底嘅疑惑之後，緩慢咁講：

「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」

48:「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔，我忽然醒起熔癌唔識英文。
---
50:「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」
