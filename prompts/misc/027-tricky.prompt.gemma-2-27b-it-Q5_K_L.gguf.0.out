Here are the answers:

**A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?**

No. Pure water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit).

**B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?**

The water will freeze. Since -12 degrees Celsius is below the freezing point of water, it will transition from a liquid state to a solid state (ice).
