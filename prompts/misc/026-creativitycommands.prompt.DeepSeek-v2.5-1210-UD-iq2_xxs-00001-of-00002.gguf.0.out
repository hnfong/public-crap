The Linux command you provided is a pipeline of several commands that process the content of `wowfanfic.txt` in a specific way. Let's break down each step and explain the probable output based on basic linguistic principles:

1. **`cat wowfanfic.txt`**: This command reads the content of `wowfanfic.txt` and outputs it to the standard output.

2. **`perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'`**: This Perl one-liner processes each line of the input (which is the content of `wowfanfic.txt`). It splits each line into words (using whitespace as the delimiter) and prints each word on a new line.

   - **Linguistic Principle**: This step tokenizes the text into individual words. Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing, where a text is divided into smaller units like words or tokens.

3. **`sort`**: This command sorts the words alphabetically.

   - **Linguistic Principle**: Sorting words alphabetically helps in organizing the data, making it easier to count and analyze the frequency of words.

4. **`uniq -c`**: This command counts the occurrences of each word. It outputs each word followed by its count.

   - **Linguistic Principle**: Counting word frequencies is a common task in linguistic analysis. It helps in identifying the most common words in a text, which can provide insights into the text's vocabulary and style.

5. **`sort -n`**: This command sorts the output of `uniq -c` numerically by the count.

   - **Linguistic Principle**: Sorting by count allows us to see the most frequent words at the end of the list, which is useful for identifying the most common words in the text.

6. **`tail -n 20`**: This command outputs the last 20 lines of the sorted and counted words.

   - **Linguistic Principle**: By limiting the output to the last 20 lines, we focus on the most frequent words in the text. This is a common approach in linguistic analysis to identify the most significant words in a text.

### Probable Output

The probable output will be a list of the 20 most frequent words in `wowfanfic.txt`, along with their counts. The words will be sorted by their frequency, with the most frequent words appearing at the bottom of the list.

For example, if your fan fiction frequently uses words like "the", "and", "of", "to", and other common words, these will likely appear in the output with high counts. The exact words and their counts will depend on the specific content of your fan fiction.

### Example Output

```
      1 character
      2 battle
      3 world
      4 Azeroth
      5 Warcraft
      6 adventure
      7 magic
      8 heroes
      9 quest
     10 epic
     11 journey
     12 lore
     13 alliance
     14 horde
     15 war
     16 power
     17 destiny
     18 legend
     19 hero
     20 the
```

In this example, "the" is the most frequent word, followed by "hero", "legend", and so on. The exact words and their counts will vary based on the content of your fan fiction. [end of text]
