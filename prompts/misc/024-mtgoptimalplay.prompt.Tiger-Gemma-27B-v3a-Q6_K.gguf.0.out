## The Optimal Play: A Burn Duel

Here's the breakdown of the optimal play for both Alice and Bob, along with the reasoning, assuming both players play optimally.

**Alice's Thought Process:**

Alice's goal is to kill Orim. She has two Kindles, and Orim is a 1/3 creature.  The damage Kindle deals is 2 + the number of Kindles in all graveyards.  Since no Kindles are in any graveyard yet, the first Kindle will deal 2 damage.  Orim will survive.  The second Kindle will deal 2 damage again, and Orim will still survive.  However, if Alice casts both Kindles at the same time, the damage will resolve simultaneously.  This is important because Orim can only prevent 3 damage *per activation*.  

Alice's optimal play is to cast *both* Kindles targeting Orim *simultaneously* (as much as the game rules allow, which is essentially casting them in sequence but with the damage resolving at the same time). This is because Orim can only prevent 3 damage with a single tap activation.  If Alice casts both spells at once, Orim can only prevent 3 damage, leaving 1 damage to go through.

**Bob's Thought Process:**

Bob's goal is to keep Orim alive. He knows Alice has two Kindles. He knows Orim can prevent 3 damage with a tap activation. Bob's optimal play is to tap Orim in response to the first Kindle being cast. This will prevent the first 3 damage. Bob does *not* respond to the second Kindle. If Bob taps Orim again, he will not be able to prevent the second Kindle's damage.

**The Outcome:**

1.  **Alice casts Kindle #1 targeting Orim.**
2.  **Bob responds by tapping Orim.** Orim's ability triggers, preventing the next 3 damage that would be dealt to it.
3.  **Kindle #1 resolves.** It would deal 2 damage, but Orim prevents all 2 damage. Orim remains at 3 life.
4.  **Alice casts Kindle #2 targeting Orim.**
5.  **Bob does *not* respond.** Bob knows Orim's ability is already used.
6.  **Kindle #2 resolves.** It deals 2 damage. Orim takes 2 damage and dies.

**Why this is optimal:**

*   **Alice:** Casting both spells in sequence maximizes the damage output. If she cast them one after another, Bob could tap Orim twice, preventing all damage.
*   **Bob:** Tapping Orim only once is the most efficient use of his ability. Tapping twice would be wasted, as Orim can only prevent 3 damage at a time.

**Game Mechanics Reference:**

*   **Instant Speed:** Kindle is an instant, meaning it can be cast during any phase of either player's turn, including in response to other spells.
*   **Stack Resolution:** Spells and abilities are placed on the stack and resolve in Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) order. This means Kindle #2 resolves before Kindle #1. However, the damage from both spells is dealt simultaneously.
*   **Damage Prevention:** Orim's ability prevents damage. If the damage is prevented, it does not apply.
*   **Simultaneous Effects:** When multiple damage sources deal damage to the same target at the same time, the damage is dealt simultaneously. This is why Orim can only prevent 3 damage total, even if multiple damage sources are active.

**Final Result:**

Orim dies. Alice successfully removes the threat with her two Kindles, and Bob's single activation of Orim's ability was not enough to save it.
