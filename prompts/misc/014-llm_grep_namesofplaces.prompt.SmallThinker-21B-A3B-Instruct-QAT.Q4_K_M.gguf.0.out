4: Take Britain, for example. They allow Silesia lawns to be imported for personal consumption, but prohibit French cambrics and lawns, even if they're meant for export. The UK also imposes higher duties on French wine, while being lenient towards Portugal. This uneven treatment is not only unfair but also stifles trade.

16: The value of trade between two countries isn't always easy to determine. Just because one country usually pays its debts to another doesn't mean that the trade balance is in its favor. Imagine if England's merchants often pay for goods from Hamburg, Dantzic, and Riga using bills from Holland. This would affect the debt and credit balance between England and Holland, even if England's exports to Holland exceed its imports.

18: Another issue is that the cost of coinage is different in each country. In England, the government covers the cost, but in France, individuals pay a duty of 8% for coinage. This makes French coins more valuable than English coins with the same amount of silver. So, even if the coins are near their standard values, a sum of English money couldn't buy an equal amount of French money.
