Bob is **partially right**, and Alice is **right about the standard freezing point**.  

Here's the explanation:  
- **Water normally freezes at 0 degrees Celsius** under standard atmospheric pressure, so Alice is correct about the standard freezing point.  
- **Bob is partially right** because water can sometimes remain in a liquid state below 0°C (a process called *supercooling*), but at -10°C, water will **almost always freeze** unless it's in a very controlled, impurity-free environment.  

So, while Alice is right about the standard freezing point, Bob is right in the context that water *does* freeze at -10°C in most real-world situations. [end of text]
