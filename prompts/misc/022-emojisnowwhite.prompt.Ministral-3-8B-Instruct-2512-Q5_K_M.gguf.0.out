🌲🌲🌲 *The Whispering Woods*

👑👑👑 **🌙 Snow’s Crown** 🌙🌙🌙

🏰👑💍 *Once upon a time*, in a kingdom where the sun kissed the mountains 🏔️🌞 and the rivers hummed lullabies 🎶💦, there lived a queen 👑💖 whose voice was as golden as the autumn leaves 🍂💛. But her heart was as cold as winter’s breath ❄️😢.

👶👶👶 One day, she gave birth to a baby girl 👧💖 with skin like fresh snow ❄️🌟 and lips as red as ripe cherries 🍒💋. The queen named her **Snow** 🌙💖.

👑💔 *"She is too beautiful!"* the queen cried, staring at her daughter in the mirror 🪞💔. *"No one shall ever be fairer than I!"* And with those words, her heart turned to ice ❄️💔.

👑👑💔 The queen’s jealousy grew like a poisoned vine 🌿💀. She ordered her servants to bring her the fairest maiden in the land, so she could compare her to Snow. But no one could match Snow’s glow 🌟💖.

🏰🚪🚪 One day, the queen’s anger boiled over. *"Take her to the deepest woods 🌲🌲🌲 and leave her there!"* she commanded. The servants, trembling, obeyed.

🌲🌲🌲👧 Snow wandered, lost, until she found a tiny cottage 🏠💖. The door was unlocked, and inside, seven little chairs 🪑🪑🪑, seven little beds 🛏️🛏️🛏️, and seven little plates 🍽️🍽️🍽️ were set for seven dwarfs 👨👨👨👨👨👨👨.

🤝🤝🤝 *"Who lives here?"* Snow asked. The dwarfs, startled, peeked out 👀👀👀. *"We do!"* grumbled **Doc** 👓💪, **Grumpy** 😤😡, **Happy** 😃😄, **Sleepy** 😴😴, **Bashful** 😳😳, **Sneezy** 🤧🤧, and **Dopey** 🤪🤪. They invited Snow to stay.

🍎🍎🍎 *"Eat, Snow!"* they said. But the queen, disguised as an old woman 👵💄, arrived. *"Let me braid your hair!"* she whispered. Snow, trusting, sat down. The queen’s comb was poisoned! ⚠️💔 *"Snow, Snow, Snow..."* the queen sang as Snow fell into a death-like sleep 😴💔.

💖💖💖 The dwarfs searched for a cure. They found a prince 👑💖 riding through the woods 🏇🌲. *"Take her to my castle!"* he said. The queen, hearing of Snow’s return, panicked.

👑💔 *"She must never wake!"* she hissed. She rushed to the cottage, but the prince was already there. With a kiss 💋💖, Snow’s eyes fluttered open. *"Snow!"* the prince cried.

💍💍💍 The queen, in a fit of rage, tried to stop the wedding 👑💍. But the prince, strong and true, stood his ground. *"She is mine!"* he declared. The queen’s heart turned to ice ❄️💔, and she fell, her crown crashing to the ground.

👑💖💖💖 Snow and the prince lived happily ever after 🏰💖. The dwarfs danced 💃🕺, and the kingdom celebrated. And though the queen was gone, her story became a warning ⚠️📖: *"Never let jealousy steal your joy."*

🌙💖💖💖 *The End.* 💖💖🌙

*(And remember, always trust your heart 💖, but watch out for those who don’t.)* 👀💔❄️ [end of text]
