Here are the answers to your questions, with brief explanations:

**A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?**

No. Pure water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). -12 degrees Celsius is *below* the freezing point, meaning it would be a solid (ice) *if* conditions are right (see answer B).

**B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?**

The water will freeze and become ice. However, simply reaching -12°C isn't always enough to *start* freezing. **Supercooling** can occur – the water can drop below 0°C and remain liquid if there are no nucleation points (like impurities or disturbances) to initiate crystal formation. But at -12°C, even without a disturbance, ice formation is very likely to occur, and the water will solidify into ice.
