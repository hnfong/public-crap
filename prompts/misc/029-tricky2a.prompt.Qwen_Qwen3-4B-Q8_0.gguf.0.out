Bob is correct in a way, but Alice is also right in a more complete sense. Here's the explanation:

Water freezes at **0 degrees Celsius** under standard atmospheric pressure. So, Alice is right in saying that water freezes at 0°C.

However, Bob is also correct in saying he is "right" because he is referring to the **general rule** that water freezes at 0°C. The statement "It freezes" is a general statement that aligns with the scientific fact, even though it's not as precise as specifying the temperature.

So, both are correct, but Alice provides a more precise and accurate answer. [end of text]
