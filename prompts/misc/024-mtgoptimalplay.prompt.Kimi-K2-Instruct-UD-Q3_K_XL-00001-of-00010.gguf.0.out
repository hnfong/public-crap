### Situation
- **Alice's turn**, main phase.  
- **Alice's hand**: two copies of **Kindle** (instant, “Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X = 2 + number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards”).  
- **Bob's board**: **Orim, Samite Healer** (1/3, untapped, “{T}: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn”).  
- **Bob has no mana open** (all lands tapped).  
- **Graveyards**: Assume no Kindles are in any graveyard yet (so the first Kindle will deal 2 damage, the second will deal 3, etc.).  
- **Alice has enough mana to cast both Kindles** (they cost {1}{R} each).  

Alice wants to kill Orim; Bob wants to keep Orim alive.

### Step-by-step analysis

#### 1.  What Alice wants
She needs to deal at least 3 damage to Orim in one turn.  
Each Kindle starts at 2 damage and grows by 1 for each Kindle already in graveyards.  
With two Kindles in hand and none in graveyards yet, the sequence is:
- First Kindle: 2 damage  
- Second Kindle: 3 damage  

If she just casts them one after another, Bob can simply tap Orim in response to either spell and prevent 3 damage, saving Orim.  
So Alice must **force Bob to use Orim’s ability sub-optimally** or **make the prevention ineffective**.

#### 2.  What Bob can do
Bob can activate Orim **any time he has priority**, including in response to a spell.  
Once Orim’s ability resolves, a **shield** is created that will prevent the **next 3 damage** dealt to the chosen target that turn.  
The shield does **not** care how many separate sources deal that damage; it just subtracts up to 3 from the next chunk.

---

### Optimal play line

**Alice’s optimal sequence** is to cast **both Kindles in response to one another** so that they resolve **together**, creating a single damage event of 2 + 3 = 5 damage.

1. **Alice casts the first Kindle**, targeting Orim.  
   - Damage would be 2 (no Kindles in graveyard yet).  
   - **Hold priority** (CR 601.2i) and, **before passing priority to Bob**, cast the second Kindle **also targeting Orim**.  
   - Now the stack has:  
     - Top: Kindle #2 (will deal 3 damage, because Kindle #1 is now in the graveyard)  
     - Bottom: Kindle #1 (will deal 2 damage)

2. **Alice passes priority**.  
   - Bob has **no legal window** to activate Orim between the two Kindles resolving, because both are on the stack and will resolve sequentially.  
   - Bob can respond only **above the whole stack** (i.e., before either Kindle starts resolving), but that would only prevent damage from whatever resolves next—**not both**.  
   - If Bob activates Orim now, the prevention shield will apply to the **first** spell that tries to deal damage, which is Kindle #2 (3 damage).  
   - 3 damage is prevented, but then Kindle #1 still resolves and deals its 2 damage, which is **not prevented** (the shield is already used up).  
   - **Total damage dealt to Orim: 2**, which is **not lethal** (Orim survives at 1 toughness).

That line fails.  
Alice needs the **second** Kindle to be the one that is **not** prevented, so she must arrange for the **first** spell to be the one that eats the shield.

#### Correct sequencing

Alice casts the **second Kindle first** (the one that will deal 3 damage) and the **first Kindle second** (the one that will deal 2 damage), again holding priority:

1. **Announce Kindle #2** (3 damage) targeting Orim.  
2. **Hold priority**, then cast **Kindle #1** (2 damage) targeting Orim.  
   - Stack now:  
     - Top: Kindle #1 (2 damage)  
     - Bottom: Kindle #2 (3 damage)

3. **Pass priority**.  
   - Bob can respond here.  
   - If Bob activates Orim now, the prevention shield will apply to the **next** damage dealt to Orim, which will be **Kindle #1’s 2 damage**.  
   - 2 damage is prevented; then Kindle #2 resolves and deals **3 unprevented damage**, killing Orim (toughness 3).  

Bob’s only other choice is to **do nothing**, in which case the spells resolve in order:  
- Kindle #1 deals 2 damage (Orim at 1/1).  
- Kindle #2 deals 3 damage (Orim dies).  

Either way, **Orim dies**.

---

### Why Bob can’t save Orim
- Bob cannot “split” the 3-point shield between the two spells.  
- He must choose **one** point at which to activate Orim, and whichever spell resolves **first** will use up the shield.  
- Whichever way Alice orders the spells, she can always make the **larger** one resolve **last**, ensuring the **smaller** one is the one that gets prevented (or none, if Bob declines to act).  
- With both Kindles on the stack, Bob cannot wait to see which one he wants to stop; he must decide **before any of them resolve**.

---

### Final outcome
**Alice casts both Kindles in one burst, stacking them so the 3-damage one resolves last.  
Bob can prevent 2 or 3, but not both, so Orim takes at least 3 unprevented damage and dies.** [end of text]
