## Interpretation of the Song: The Last Supper Restaurant

This song tells the story of a peculiar, liminal restaurant nestled deep within a forest, serving a very specific clientele: **the recently deceased.** It's a place where souls arrive, not by following paths (the acorns), but by being *forgotten* by the living. The lighthearted melody and slightly mischievous tone suggest a bittersweet, almost playful acceptance of death.

**Here's a breakdown of the story, with a literal fantastical interpretation:**

*   **Setting:** A tiny, hidden restaurant in the forest. Its existence is tied to the act of being forgotten. The acorns represent the conventional paths of life, which don't lead here. You arrive only when someone stops remembering you.
*   **The Restaurant's Purpose:** It's a final, comforting meal for the newly departed. The "empty pockets" being fiddled with symbolize the lack of earthly possessions or concerns the souls carry. The "empty seats" at lunchtime are for the fresh arrivals. The birds laughing suggest a gentle, natural cycle of life and death.
*   **The Menu & Atmosphere:** The red-painted tin roof is a quirky, slightly ramshackle detail. The only item on the menu is "the recommendation" – a full course meal. The sounds of classical instruments (violin, flute, cello, viola) create a sophisticated, yet slightly melancholic ambiance. It's a feast for the senses, a final indulgence.
*   **The Service & Farewell:** The welcoming greeting ("Welcome, welcome! Come in!") is warm and inviting. The promise of a "full meal then sleep" is a gentle euphemism for death. The "goodbye" and "see you tomorrow" (which is never coming) are a playful acknowledgement of the finality. The "Etcetera" suggests the vastness of the afterlife.
*   **The Dance & The Last Course:** The "right to left" dance (a common Japanese farewell gesture) is performed by the souls, even including a hand-tamed bear cub (perhaps a spirit animal or a soul in animal form). The menu is extensive (carpaccio, paella, appetizers) but deliberately lacks dessert – a symbolic end to indulgence. The chilling final line, "We'll deliver it to your grave," confirms this is the last meal, served to those who are truly gone.

**Fantastical Literal Interpretation:**

This isn't a metaphor for grief or memory. It's a *real* restaurant in a magical forest. It exists in a space between worlds, accessible only to souls who have faded from the memories of the living. The restaurant itself might be run by benevolent spirits or forgotten deities. The food isn't symbolic; it's a genuine, delicious last meal prepared for the comfort of the departed. The "forgetting" is the key – the restaurant appears only when someone is truly forgotten, and the souls arrive drawn by that absence. The bear cub dancing is a literal magical creature enjoying the feast. The delivery to the grave is a supernatural service.

**Why this interpretation works:**

*   **Consistency:** The lyrics maintain a consistent fantastical logic. The acorns, the forgotten souls, the dancing bear, the delivery to the grave – all fit within a coherent magical world.
*   **Lighthearted Tone:** The melody's mischievousness is explained by the restaurant's quirky nature and the playful farewells. It's not mocking death, but acknowledging it with a gentle, slightly absurd charm.
*   **Thematic Resonance:** The song explores the bittersweet nature of being remembered and forgotten. The restaurant offers comfort in the face of oblivion, making the fantastical literal interpretation emotionally resonant.

**In essence, the song tells the story of a magical restaurant that serves the last meal to those who have faded from the world's memory, offering a final, comforting indulgence before they move on.** It's a whimsical, slightly melancholic celebration of life, death, and the importance of being remembered.
