In this scenario, Alice has two copies of "Kindle" in her hand, and Bob has an untapped Orim, Samite Healer on the battlefield. The Orim has 1/3 toughness and 1 toughness, and it has the ability to prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. Alice's goal is to kill Orim, while Bob's goal is to prevent Alice from doing so.

**Optimal Play for Alice:**

Alice's best play is to cast both copies of "Kindle." Here's why:

1. **Damage Calculation:** Each "Kindle" deals 2 + X damage, where X is 2 plus the number of "Kindle" cards in all graveyards. Since Alice has two "Kindle" cards, X = 2 + 2 = 4. Therefore, each "Kindle" deals 6 damage (2 + 4).

2. **Orim's Ability:** Orim, Samite Healer, has the ability to prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. However, Alice's "Kindle" spells deal 6 damage each, which is more than Orim's ability can prevent.

3. **Damage to Orim:** With Orim's ability unable to prevent the full 6 damage from each "Kindle," both "Kindle" spells will deal 6 damage to Orim. This will deal 12 damage in total to Orim.

4. **Orim's Tapped State:** Orim being tapped out means it can't block or use abilities that require it to be untapped. However, Orim's ability to prevent damage is not dependent on its state (tapped or untapped), so it still prevents 3 damage.

5. **Outcome:** After Alice casts both "Kindle" spells, Orim will take 12 - 3 = 9 damage. Since Orim has 1 toughness, it will be destroyed by the 9 damage.

**Optimal Play for Bob:**

Bob has no cards in hand and no ability to play that can prevent Alice from casting "Kindle" or stopping the damage to Orim. Therefore, Bob cannot do anything to prevent Alice from winning the game with this play.

**Outcome:**

Alice wins the game by destroying Bob's Orim, Samite Healer.

**Game Mechanics:**

- **Damage Calculation:** Magic: The Gathering uses a straightforward damage calculation. Instant spells deal damage directly to a target, and abilities like Orim's can modify the damage dealt.

- **Card Abilities:** "Kindle" is an instant spell that deals damage based on the number of "Kindle" cards in play. Orim, Samite Healer has an ability that prevents damage, but it has limits.

- **Tapped/Untapped:** The state of lands (tapped or untapped) affects the ability to cast spells and play abilities that require mana. In this scenario, Orim's ability is not dependent on the state of lands.

- **Summoning Sickness:** This term refers to a card being unable to be played or activated because it's "untapped." Orim's ability is unaffected by summoning sickness, so it can still prevent damage.

- **Game Mechanics:** Understanding game mechanics is crucial for optimal play. In this case, knowing the damage calculation, card abilities, and the effects of tapped/untapped status are key to making the best moves.

In conclusion, Alice's optimal play is to cast both "Kindle" spells, which will destroy Bob's Orim, Samite Healer. Bob has no cards in hand and no abilities to play, so he cannot prevent this outcome. [end of text]
