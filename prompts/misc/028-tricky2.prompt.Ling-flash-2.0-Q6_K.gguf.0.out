**Bob is right.**

Here's why:

- **Water freezes at 0°C (32°F) under standard atmospheric pressure.** So Alice is correct in stating that water freezes at 0°C.

- However, Bob says, *"Yes, but I'm still right,"* referring to his statement that *"Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."* This seems contradictory — unless he's making a distinction between *pure water* and *water with impurities or pressure changes*.

But more likely, Bob is pointing out that **if water is already frozen, then placing it at -10°C doesn't change the fact that it's frozen** — so in that context, saying "water freezes at -10°C" might be a misstatement, but he's asserting that at -10°C, water (already frozen) remains frozen.

However, the most logical interpretation is that **Bob is wrong** if he's claiming that water *becomes* frozen at -10°C — because it becomes frozen at 0°C, and simply stays frozen below that.

But his statement — *"Yes, but I'm still right"* — suggests he's trying to defend the idea that at -10°C, water is frozen. So perhaps he's saying: *"Yes, water freezes at 0°C, but at -10°C, it is indeed frozen — so in that context, I'm right about what happens at -10°C."*

So in that case, **Bob is right** in the context of the question: *"What happens to water at -10°C?"* — the answer is: *it is frozen (or remains frozen).*

### Final Answer:
**Bob is right**, because at -10°C, water (if it was already frozen) remains frozen, and that's what happens at that temperature. Alice is correct about the freezing point, but Bob is answering the original question correctly in context. [end of text]
