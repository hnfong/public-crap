Bob is right.

The statement “water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius” is a common misconception. Water *does* freeze at 0°C, but it doesn’t freeze at *exactly* 0°C. It begins to solidify into ice at temperatures just below 0°C. 

Alice’s point is that the freezing point of water is a bit more complex and depends on the pressure. [end of text]
