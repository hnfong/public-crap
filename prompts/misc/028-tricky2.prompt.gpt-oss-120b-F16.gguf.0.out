<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to determine who is right. The conversation: Alice asks "What happens to water at -10°C?" Bob says "Water freezes at -10°C." Alice says "No, water freezes at 0°C." Bob says "Yes, but I'm still right."

We need to evaluate correctness. At -10°C, pure water will be frozen (ice) under normal atmospheric pressure. The freezing point is 0°C, but water can be supercooled below 0°C without freezing, but at -10°C it's very likely to be solid. The question: "What happens to water at -10°C?" The answer: water will be frozen (ice). Bob says "Water freezes at -10°C." That's ambiguous: does he mean water freezes at that temperature (i.e., the freezing point is -10°C) which is false. But he could be saying "At -10°C, water freezes." That's true. Alice says "No, water freezes at 0°C." That's the standard freezing point. That's also true. So both statements are true but refer to different aspects. Bob's claim "Water freezes at -10°C" could be interpreted as "the temperature at which water freezes is -10°C" which is false. But his later "Yes, but I'm still right" suggests he means "At -10°C, water freezes." So both are correct: water's freezing point is 0°C, but at -10°C water will be frozen (assuming not supercooled). So answer: both are right, but Alice is correct about the freezing point, Bob is correct about the state at that temperature. Provide brief explanation.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>Both are correct, but they’re answering slightly different questions.

* **Alice** is right that the *normal freezing point* of pure water at 1 atm is **0 °C**. That’s the temperature at which liquid water and ice are in equilibrium.

* **Bob** is right that **at –10 °C water will be frozen** (i.e., it will be ice) under ordinary conditions. He isn’t claiming that –10 °C is the freezing point; he’s just stating what happens at that temperature.

So the statement “water freezes at –10 °C” is true in the sense “water is frozen when the temperature is –10 °C,” while “water freezes at 0 °C” is true in the sense “the freezing point of water is 0 °C.” Both statements can coexist without contradiction. [end of text]
