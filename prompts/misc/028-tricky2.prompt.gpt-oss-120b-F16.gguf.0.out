<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to determine who is right. The conversation: Alice asks "What happens to water at -10°C?" Bob says "Water freezes at -10°C." Alice says "No, water freezes at 0°C." Bob says "Yes, but I'm still right."

We need to evaluate the statements. At -10°C, pure water would be frozen (ice). However, water can be supercooled below 0°C without freezing, but at -10°C it's likely to freeze. The question: "What happens to water at -10°C?" The correct answer: water will be frozen (ice) under normal conditions. So Bob's statement "Water freezes at -10°C" is true (it does freeze at that temperature). Alice says "No, water freezes at 0°C." That's also true: the normal freezing point is 0°C. But the question is about -10°C. So Bob is correct that at -10°C water is frozen. Alice's statement is not addressing the condition; she says the freezing point is 0°C, which is correct but not answering the question. So Bob is right in context. Also note supercooling can keep water liquid below 0°C, but at -10°C it's unlikely. So answer: Bob is right. Provide brief explanation.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Bob is right.**  

- Under ordinary conditions pure water freezes at **0 °C**, which is what Alice states.  
- The question, however, asks what happens **at –10 °C**. At that temperature water is well below its normal freezing point, so it will be **frozen (ice)** (unless it is specially super‑cooled, which is a rare, metastable case).  

Thus Bob’s answer that water is frozen at –10 °C correctly describes the state of water at that temperature, while Alice’s reply only restates the normal freezing point without addressing the –10 °C condition. [end of text]
