Bob is correct. While water freezes at 0°C under normal conditions, at -10°C, water is well below its freezing point and will indeed be frozen (solid ice). Alice is technically correct about the freezing point, but Bob's statement is also correct because water at -10°C is frozen. Both are right in different ways, but Bob's answer is more directly relevant to the question asked. [end of text]
