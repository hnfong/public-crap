Bob is right. At -10 degrees Celsius, water still freezes, but the freezing point is 0 degrees Celsius. The statement "water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius" is correct, and Bob's response is accurate. The confusion arises from the fact that the freezing point is a temperature, not a state. At -10°C, water is in the solid state (ice), but the freezing point is 0°C. So Bob is correct in saying that water freezes at 0°C, even though it's below that temperature. [end of text]
