Okay, so I need to come up with a place in World of Warcraft lore for each letter of the alphabet, starting with A for Azeroth, and it has to be original vanilla WoW only, no expansions. Let me start by recalling the major locations from vanilla WoW. 

First, Azeroth is the main world, so that's the starting point. Then there's the various continents like Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms. Key places include Orgrimmar, Stormwind City, Ironforge, Dalaran, Undercity, Gnomeregan, the Blighted Plane, etc. Also, places like the Dark Portal, the Ring of the Damned, the Sunwell, the Seat of the Khan, the Hinterlands, the Barrens, the Wailing Caves, the Uldaman, the Ruined Dawn, the Twilight Highlands... Wait, but some of these might be from expansions. Let me check which are in vanilla.

Vanilla WoW includes up to the level cap of 60, so places introduced in The Burning Crusade expansion (like Terokkar Forest, etc.) are out. So I need to stick to pre-BC locations. Let's list some key places:

Azeroth (already covered for A), then:

B: Maybe Blighted Plane? Or the Blight? Wait, Blight is a spell. The Blighted Plane is a zone in Outland, but that's BC. Hmm. Maybe the Blight Spire? Or the Blight? Alternatively, the Barrens (B for Borean tundra? Wait, Borean tundra is from WotLK. The Barrens are part of the Eastern Kingdoms, so maybe B for Barrens? But the answer needs to be a specific place. Let me think. The Barrens is a region, but maybe a specific location within it. Alternatively, the Blighted Plane is not vanilla. Wait, maybe the Blight is part of some questline. Alternatively, the B for the Borean Wars? No, that's a conflict. Maybe the B for the Bronzebeard Clan? No, that's a dwarf clan. Wait, the Bronzebeard Brewery? That's a quest area in the Blasted Lands, which is vanilla. But the Blasted Lands themselves are a zone. So maybe B for Blasted Lands? But the user wants a place name starting with B. Let me check.

Wait, the user said "Original vanilla WoW only, no expansions." So Blasted Lands is part of the Eastern Kingdoms, introduced in vanilla. So B could be Blasted Lands. But let's see. Let's go through each letter step by step.

A: Azeroth (already given). Then B: Maybe the Blighted Plane is not vanilla. Wait, the Blight is a spell, but maybe the Blight Spire? Or the Blight? Alternatively, the Borean tundra is from WotLK, so not allowed. Maybe the Barrens? The Barrens is a region in Kalimdor, so B for Barrens? But the full name is Barrens. So B: Barrens? But maybe a specific location within the Barrens. For example, the Crossroads in the Barrens. But the answer needs to be a place name starting with B. So Barrens is acceptable. But let's confirm. The Barrens is a zone in vanilla WoW, so yes. So B: Barrens.

C: The C for Cenarion Circle? No, that's a faction. The C for Cenarion Hold? Or Cenarion Enclave? Or maybe the Circle of the Wakening? Wait, the Cenarion Circle is a faction, but their base of operations in vanilla is in the Ruins of Cenarion Keep in the Blasted Lands. Maybe C for Cenarion Keep? Or the Caverns of Time? The Caverns of Time is a zone in Tanaris, which is part of the AQ40 instance, but that's vanilla. So C for Caverns of Time? That's possible. Alternatively, the C for Coldridge quarry? That's a quest area in the Barrens. But maybe C for Coldridge? Or the C for the Circle of the Wakening? Hmm. Let me check. The Cenarion Circle's main location in vanilla is the Ruins of Cenarion Keep. So maybe C for Cenarion Keep. But the name starts with C. So C: Cenarion Keep. Alternatively, the Caverns of Time. Let's go with Caverns of Time since it's a specific place.

D: Dalaran. That's a city in Outland, but introduced in BC. Wait, in vanilla, Dalaran was just a name, and the actual city in Outland is from BC. Wait, no. In vanilla, Dalaran was the name of the old capital in the Eastern Kingdoms, which was destroyed by the Lich King. In BC, they built Dalaran in Outland. So maybe in vanilla, Dalaran is still a name, but not a physical place anymore. So maybe D for the Dalaran Crystal? Or the Dalaran fragment? Alternatively, the Dalaran Keep? Or maybe the D for the Dunes of Zar'd'gar? That's a zone in Zul'Jasal, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the Dark Portal? That's a location in Outland, BC. Hmm. Wait, the D for the Duskwood? Duskwood is a zone in the Eastern Kingdoms, introduced in vanilla. So D: Duskwood. That's a possibility. Alternatively, the D for the Deadmines? That's a dungeon in the Blasted Lands, part of vanilla. But the Deadmines start with D. So D: Deadmines. But the user wants a place, not a dungeon. But maybe it's acceptable. Alternatively, D for the Dalaran fragment in the Blasted Lands. Hmm. Let me check. Duskwood is a zone in vanilla, so D: Duskwood.

E: E for the Eastern Kingdoms? But that's too broad. Maybe the Emerald Dream? The Emerald Dream is a place in vanilla, accessible via the Moonwell in the Ruins of Andorhal. So E: Emerald Dream. Or the Emeraldsanctuary? Wait, the Emerald Dream is the correct term. So E: Emerald Dream.

F: The Frothgar's Cave? No, that's a quest area in the Wailing Caves. Or the Forge of Souls? That's a dungeon in Outland, BC. Alternatively, the Forge Camps? In the Blasted Lands, there's the Forge Camps, which are part of the Deadmines. So F: Forge Camps? Or maybe the Forge of Samson? That's a location in the Western Plaguelands. Samson is a character, and his forge is a place. So F: Forge of Samson. That's possible.

G: G for Gnomeregan? That's a dungeon in the Blasted Lands, vanilla. So G: Gnomeregan. But wait, Gnomeregan is the name of the instance, but the city is called Gnomeregan as well. So yes, G for Gnomeregan.

H: H for the Hinterlands? The Hinterlands is a zone in Kalimdor, vanilla. So H: Hinterlands.

I: I for the Ironforge? Yes, Ironforge is the dwarf capital in the Dun Morra mountains, Eastern Kingdoms. So I: Ironforge.

J: J for the Journal of the Void? No, that's a quest item. Alternatively, the Jadespine Forest? That's part of the Twilight Highlands, which is BC. Hmm. Maybe the J for the Junction? No. Alternatively, the J for the Jormungarth? No. Wait, maybe the name of a zone starting with J. In vanilla, are there any zones starting with J? Let me think. The only one I can recall is the Journal of the Void, but that's not a place. Maybe the name of a dungeon? Or perhaps the name of a location in a book or a quest. Alternatively, maybe the user can accept a creative answer if there's no exact place. But I need to find a real place. Alternatively, maybe the name of the Seat of the Khan? No, that starts with S. Wait, the Journal of the Void is a quest in the Blasted Lands, but it's not a place. Maybe J for the Jormungarth's lair? No, that's from BC. Hmm. Maybe there's no exact place starting with J in vanilla. Wait, the name of the zone called "The Journal of the Void" is not a place. Alternatively, maybe the name of a location in the Blasted Lands, like the Junktown? No, that's not a real place. Alternatively, maybe the name of a location in the Wailing Caves? The Wailing Caves is a zone, but starts with W. Maybe the user can accept a creative answer here. Let me check. Alternatively, maybe the name of the zone "The JADE Forest"? Wait, Jade Forest is in Pandaria, BC. So not allowed. Hmm. Maybe the answer for J is the Journal of the Void, but that's not a place. Alternatively, maybe the name of a location in the Caverns of Time, like the Timeline? No. Alternatively, maybe the name of a location in the
