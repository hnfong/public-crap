### Conflicts and Why

Several events have overlapping times (i.e., their time intervals intersect), which means if a person or resource is attending both, there would be a conflict. Here are the conflicts:

#### 1. **Conference Call (2022-03-15, 09:00–10:30) vs Conference Call (2022-03-15, 10:00–11:00)**
   - The second call starts before the first one ends. Overlap: 10:00–10:30.

#### 2. **Team Lunch (2023-07-21, 12:00–13:30) vs Team Lunch (2023-07-21, 13:00–14:00)**
   - The second lunch starts before the first one ends. Overlap: 13:00–13:30.

#### 3. **Doctor Appointment (2021-11-04, 16:00–17:00) vs Doctor Appointment (2021-11-04, 17:00–18:00)**
   - The second appointment starts exactly when the first one ends. Depending on whether appointments are back-to-back or if there's a gap, this could be a conflict if no break is allowed.

#### 4. **Workshop (2023-05-12, 14:00–16:00) vs Workshop (2023-05-12, 15:00–17:00)**
   - The second workshop starts before the first one ends. Overlap: 15:00–16:00.

#### 5. **Gym Session (2022-01-20, 06:00–07:00) vs Gym Session (2022-01-20, 07:00–08:00)**
   - The second session starts exactly when the first one ends. Again, could be a conflict if no break is allowed.

#### 6. **Family Reunion (2023-08-25, 10:00–16:00) vs Family Reunion (2023-08-25, 15:00–18:00)**
   - The second reunion starts before the first one ends. Overlap: 15:00–16:00.

#### 7. **Movie Night (2022-04-10, 19:30–22:00) vs Movie Night (2022-04-10, 21:00–23:00)**
   - The second movie night starts before the first one ends. Overlap: 21:00–22:00.

#### 8. **Conference (2024-06-01, 09:00–12:00) vs Conference (2024-06-01, 11:00–13:00)**
   - The second conference starts before the first one ends. Overlap: 11:00–12:00.

#### 9. **Interview (2023-10-14, 15:00–16:30) vs Interview (2023-10-14, 16:00–17:30)**
   - The second interview starts before the first one ends. Overlap: 16:00–16:30.

#### 10. **Wedding Ceremony (2022-12-24, 11:00–13:00) vs Wedding Ceremony (2022-12-24, 13:30–15:30)**
   - These do **not** overlap (there's a 30-minute gap), so no conflict unless you consider the gap too short.

#### 11. **Office Meeting (2023-03-08, 09:30–10:00) vs Office Meeting (2023-03-08, 09:45–10:15)**
   - The second meeting starts before the first one ends. Overlap: 09:45–10:00.

#### 12. **Volunteer Event (2024-04-20, 10:00–13:00) vs Volunteer Event (2024-04-20, 12:30–14:00)**
   - The second event starts before the first one ends. Overlap: 12:30–13:00.

#### 13. **Book Club (2022-06-17, 18:00–19:30) vs Book Club (2022-06-17, 19:00–20:30)**
   - The second club starts before the first one ends. Overlap: 19:00–19:30.

#### 14. **Sports Match (2023-09-02, 16:00–19:00) vs Sports Match (2023-09-02, 18:00–20:00)**
   - The second match starts before the first one ends. Overlap: 18:00–19:00.

#### 15. **Parent-Teacher Meeting (2021-12-15, 17:00–18:30) vs Parent-Teacher Meeting (2021-12-15, 18:30–20:00)**
   - The second meeting starts exactly when the first one ends. Could be a conflict if no break is allowed.

**Summary:**  
Most conflicts are due to overlapping time intervals for events with the same or different names on the same date. Some are back-to-back with no gap, which may or may not be considered a conflict depending on context. Let me know if you want only strict overlaps (excluding back-to-back) or if you want to resolve these conflicts in some way! [end of text]
