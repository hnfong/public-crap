We are given a scenario in **Magic: The Gathering** between **Alice** and **Bob**, with the following setup:

---

### **Players and Resources**

- **Alice**:
  - Hand: Two copies of **Kindle** (an instant card).
  - Mana: Sufficient to cast any spells (assume she can cast both Kindles if needed).
  - Goal: Kill **Orim, Samite Healer** (which Bob has in play).

- **Bob**:
  - Hand: Empty.
  - In Play: **Orim, Samite Healer** (untapped, 1/3, legendary).
  - Ability: *"Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."*
  - Lands: Tapped out (so Bob cannot produce mana this turn).

- It is **Alice’s turn**.
- **Orim has been on the battlefield for a while**, so **no summoning sickness**.
- We are using **2024 MTG rules**.

---

## **Step 1: Understand the Cards**

### **Kindle** (Instant)
- **Text**: "Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards."

So:
- If there are **0 Kindle** cards in graveyards, Kindle deals **2 damage**.
- If there are **1 Kindle** in graveyards, it deals **3 damage**.
- If there are **2 Kindles** in graveyards, it deals **4 damage**, etc.

Important: The graveyard count includes **all** Kindles, including those in hand, graveyard, and exile — **but not** in libraries or on the battlefield.

At the start of this turn:
- Alice has **two Kindles in hand**, none in graveyard.
- So **X = 2** initially.

### **Orim, Samite Healer**
- **Tap ability**: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.

Important:
- This is a **tap ability** that can be activated **any time it’s Bob’s turn or his upkeep**, but since it’s **Alice’s turn**, Bob can activate it **any time it’s his priority** (i.e., in response to spells or abilities).
- The effect is **prevent the next 3 damage** — it's a **static effect** once activated.
- It can be used **once per activation**, but can be used multiple times if Bob taps it multiple times (but each activation prevents 3 damage).

Also, **Orim is a creature**, so it can be attacked or targeted by spells.

---

## **Step 2: Alice’s Goal**

Alice wants to **kill Orim**, which has **3 toughness**.

She has two copies of **Kindle** in hand. She can cast them in response to each other or at different times.

She must consider:
- Orim’s ability can prevent damage.
- She must account for **graveyard buildup** as she casts spells.

---

## **Step 3: Sequence of Play**

It's **Alice’s turn**, so she can:
1. Draw a card (but she has no deck, so assume she can’t — or maybe she has a library? Not specified. Since it's not mentioned, assume she has no library and cannot draw.)
2. Play land (but Bob’s lands are tapped out, and Alice’s lands are not mentioned — assume she can produce mana, so lands are available).
3. Cast spells.

Let’s assume Alice can tap lands for mana.

We’ll walk through the **optimal play for both players**.

---

## **Step 4: Alice’s Plan**

Alice wants to deal **at least 3 damage to Orim**.

She has two **Kindle**s. Let’s explore possible sequences.

### **Option 1: Cast one Kindle for 2 damage**

- Alice casts **Kindle**, targeting Orim.
- At the time of casting, **no Kindle** in graveyard → X = 2.
- Damage dealt: 2.
- Orim’s toughness is 3 → survives.
- Kindle goes to graveyard.

Now, graveyard has **1 Kindle**.

Bob can now activate Orim’s ability:
- Bob taps Orim: "Prevent the next 3 damage this turn."
- This would prevent any further damage dealt this turn.

So if Alice tries to cast the second Kindle, it would deal X = 2 + 1 (from graveyard) = 3 damage.
But Bob can prevent the next 3 damage → **the second Kindle does 0 damage**.

Result: Orim survives with 1 toughness.

Alice cannot kill Orim this way.

### **Option 2: Cast both Kindles in response to each other?**

Wait — can she cast the second Kindle **in response to her own first Kindle**?

Yes, she can cast spells during her turn, and priority works normally.

So:

1. Alice casts **Kindle** (first one), targeting Orim.
   - X = 2 → 2 damage.
   - Goes to graveyard.
   - Now graveyard has 1 Kindle.

2. Bob can respond. He can:
   - Let the damage through, or
   - Activate Orim’s ability to prevent next 3 damage.

If Bob activates Orim’s ability, then:
- Next 3 damage is prevented.
- Alice cannot kill Orim with the second Kindle (which would deal 3 damage).

But if Bob **does not respond**, Alice can immediately cast the second Kindle.

Let’s assume Bob is playing optimally.

So after Alice casts the first Kindle, Bob will almost certainly activate Orim’s ability to prevent the next 3 damage.

So second Kindle does 0 damage.

Still not enough.

### **Option 3: Is there a way to get more than 3 damage?**

Only if she can get X higher.

But to get X = 3, she needs **1 Kindle in graveyard** (which she gets after casting the first one).

To get X = 4, she needs **2 Kindles in graveyard**, which would require casting both before anything resolves.

But she can’t cast both at once unless she has enough mana.

Let’s suppose she has **enough mana to cast both Kindles in the same instant** (e.g., she has 2 mana, and each Kindle costs, say, 1 or 2 — exact cost not given, but assume she can cast both).

Wait — **what is the mana cost of Kindle?**

This is a problem — the question didn’t specify the mana cost of Kindle.

But in **Magic**, **Kindle** is from **Dissension** (a Ravnica set), and its mana cost is **{2}{R}** — so **3 mana total**.

So each Kindle costs **3 mana**.

So if Alice wants to cast **two Kindles**, she needs **6 mana**.

Assuming she can do that, let’s proceed.

---

## **Step 5: Reconsider with Mana Cost of Kindle = {2}{R}**

So each Kindle costs **3 mana**.

Alice must spend 3 mana per Kindle.

So to cast both, she needs 6 mana.

Assume she can do that.

Now, can she cast both in a way that **avoids Bob’s counterplay**?

Let’s try:

### **Option: Cast both Kindles in response to each other? No — she can only cast one at a time.**

She can cast the first Kindle, then cast the second in response to her own spell (if there's a trigger), but not unless something happens.

So:

1. **Main Phase → Alice casts Kindle (first copy
