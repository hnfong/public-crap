The command you typed is a classic “word-frequency” pipeline.  
It will print the 20 most-frequent words that appear in your file, together with their counts, in ascending order of frequency.

Step-by-step what happens:

1. cat wowfanfic.txt  
   Sends the whole text to STDOUT.

2. perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'  
   - -n reads the file line by line.  
   - split(/\s/) breaks each line on any run of white-space (space, tab, newline).  
   - Every chunk between white-space is treated as a “word” and printed on its own line.  
   - Punctuation that is glued to a word (“Thrall,” “Jaina!”) is kept as part of the token, so “Thrall,” and “Thrall” will be counted as two different strings.

3. sort  
   Lexicographically sorts the resulting list of tokens.  
   Identical tokens become adjacent.

4. uniq -c  
   Collapses identical adjacent tokens and prefixes each with its frequency.

5. sort -n  
   Sorts those “frequency  word” lines numerically by the count.

6. tail -n 20  
   Keeps only the last 20 lines, i.e. the 20 highest counts.

Probable output (illustrative, not literal):

      47 the  
      51 a  
      53 to  
      57 of  
      62 and  
      64 in  
      68 was  
      71 her  
      75 she  
      79 he  
      83 his  
      88 said  
      92 with  
      96 on  
      101 at  
      108 for  
      115 that  
      124 it  
      131 Jaina  
      145 Thrall  

Linguistic interpretation

- The top positions are dominated by function words (articles, prepositions, pronouns, auxiliary verbs).  
  These closed-class items are highly frequent in every English text because they glue the content words together.

- Among the top 20 you will usually see a handful of content words that are central to your story’s topic—here “Jaina” and “Thrall” appear, reflecting the WoW setting.  
  Their presence illustrates the principle of topical salience: proper names that carry the narrative appear more often than ordinary nouns.

- Because the pipeline is case-sensitive and keeps punctuation, variants like “Thrall,” “thrall”, “Jaina.”, “jaina” will be counted separately.  
  This shows the importance of normalization (lower-casing, stripping punctuation) in corpus linguistics; without it, frequency lists are inflated by spelling variants.

- Zipf’s law is visible: a few words have very high counts, while the long tail contains thousands of words that occur only once or twice.  
  The command only shows the very tip of that distribution.

So the final 20 lines will be a mix of ubiquitous grammatical words plus the most prominent character and lore-specific terms from your fan fiction. [end of text]
