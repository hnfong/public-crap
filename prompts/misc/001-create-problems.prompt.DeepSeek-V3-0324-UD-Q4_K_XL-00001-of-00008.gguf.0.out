Here’s a creative set of 8 questions spanning English and Chinese, with increasing difficulty and strict adherence to your constraints (including the sneaky "z" and "平" rules!):

---

**Q1 (Easy, English):**  
Name two *animals* with the letter "z" in their name.  
*(Hint: One is striped, the other is tiny.)*  
**Answer key:** Zebra, lizard (or koala, though "z" is silent).  

---

**Q2 (Easy, Chinese):**  
“平”字在“苹果”和“公平”中的意思相同吗？用简单词解释差异。  
**答案键:** 不同。“苹果”中是名称（无实义），“公平”中意为“平等”。  

---

**Q3 (Medium, English):**  
Solve this riddle: "I’m *amazing* when whole, but broken if you *zoom* in. What am I?"  
**Answer key:** A promise ("whole promise" vs. "broken promise").  

---

**Q4 (Medium, Chinese):**  
“碳中和”和“平凡生活”如何通过“平”字关联？用一句话说明。  
**答案键:** “平”可指平衡（碳中和）或普通（平凡），体现汉字多义性。  

---

**Q5 (Hard, English):**  
*Puzzle:* Rearrange "zombie fast dance" to name a *real* country.  
**Answer key:** Belize ("zombie fast" → Be-lize).  

---

**Q6 (Hard, Chinese):**  
数学题: 若“平均数”是5，且三个数为3、5、x，求x的值。  
**答案键:** 7 （(3+5+x)/3=5 → x=7）。  

---

**Q7 (Very Hard, English):**  
*Linguistics:* The word "hazy" contains "z" but its German translation "dunstig" doesn’t. Why might this *happen* historically?  
**Answer key:** English borrowed "haze" from Old Norse, while German used native roots.  

---

**Q8 (Very Hard, Chinese):**  
*哲学题:* “平”在“平权”和“平淡”中分别象征“正义”与“无趣”。这是汉字矛盾吗？用10字内回答。  
**答案键:** 否，语境决定语义。  

---  

**Design notes:**  
- **"z" and "平" tricks:** Sneakily embedded (e.g., "zoom," "amazing," "平均数," "平凡").  
- **Graded difficulty:** From animal names (Q1) to linguistics/history (Q7) and philosophy (Q8).  
- **Objective grading:** Mix of MC, short answers, and puzzles with clear keys.  
- **Multilingual:** Tests both languages and cultural nuances (e.g., Chinese character semantics).
