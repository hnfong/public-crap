Bob is right, but not for the reason he initially stated.

Bob is correct that water will freeze at -10°C - it's just that he's being a bit cheeky about it. Water does indeed freeze at 0°C under normal atmospheric pressure, but when the temperature drops to -10°C, the water is already frozen. So Bob's statement "it freezes" is technically correct - the water at -10°C is in a frozen state.

Alice is correct about the freezing point of water (0°C), but she's missing the point that Bob is describing what happens to water at -10°C, not what the freezing point is. The question was about the state of water at that temperature, not about the freezing point itself. [end of text]
