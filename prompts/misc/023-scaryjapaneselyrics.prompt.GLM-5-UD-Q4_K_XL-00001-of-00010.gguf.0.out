Here is an interpretation of the story depicted in the lyrics.

**The Story: The Restaurant at the End of Life**

This song tells the story of a recently deceased soul wandering into a whimsical, otherworldly restaurant that serves as a waystation between life and death.

Here is the breakdown of the narrative arc:

**1. The Journey and the State of the Guest**
The protagonist is following acorns (a symbol often associated with forest spirits or childhood innocence), but they realize they aren't arriving at a normal destination. They arrive at a "Small Restaurant in the Forest."
Crucially, the protagonist fiddles with their "empty pockets." This suggests they have left the material world behind—they have no money, no possessions, and perhaps no memories of the living ("forgetting the people they left behind"). They have no reservation, yet they are expected. The empty restaurant and the laughing little birds hint that this is a secluded, spiritual realm, not a bustling eatery in the human world.

**2. The Atmosphere**
The setting is vividly described with a "bright red tin roof." The music coming from the kitchen (violin, flute, cello) suggests a sophisticated, perhaps slightly old-fashioned or classical atmosphere, contrasting with the rustic "forest" setting. It feels like a dream or a constructed reality meant to put the guest at ease.

**3. The Feast**
The guests are welcomed warmly ("Welcome, welcome"). The lyrics describe a chaotic, lively feast ("Right to left, in a flurry," "A hand-held bear cub dances"). The menu items—Carpaccio, Paella, Risotto—are heavy, indulgent foods. This is a "Last Supper" in the truest sense. The protagonist and other guests are encouraged to eat their fill before sleeping.

**4. The Literal Twist**
The climax of the song reveals the true nature of the establishment.
*   **"Dessert is not on the menu":** There is no sweet finish or continuation of the pleasure; the meal is the final act.
*   **"We will deliver you even inside the grave":** This line confirms the destination is not home, but the afterlife.
*   **"Tonight is the final full course":** This is not just dinner; it is the conclusion of their existence.

**Conclusion**
The "mischievous" melody fits perfectly because the restaurant is a trap—albeit a gentle, benevolent one. It lures the weary souls in with the promise of a fun lunch and music, feeds them a glorious final meal, and then sends them off to "sleep" (death) with a cheerful "Goodbye." It is a fantastical tale about a soul who stumbles into a forest purgatory, enjoys one last moment of vibrancy, and is peacefully escorted to the grave. [end of text]
