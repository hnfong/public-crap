In this Magic: The Gathering scenario, we need to analyze the optimal play for **Alice** and **Bob** based on the given conditions. Let's break down the situation and evaluate the best possible moves for each player.

### **Game State Summary**

- **Alice**:
  - 2 copies of **Kindle** (instant):  
    - **Kindle** deals X damage to any target, where X = 2 + number of **Kindle** in graveyards.
  - **Bob**:
    - 1 copy of **Orim** (legendary creature, 1/3 toughness, attack/toughness 1/3)  
      - **Orim's ability**: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."
    - **Samite Healer** (creature, 2/2) is in play, **untapped**.
    - **Bob's lands are tapped out** (no lands in play).

---

### **Key Mechanics to Consider**

- **Kindle** is an **instant** that deals **X damage**, where **X = 2 + number of Kindle in graveyards**.
- **Orim** has a **tap ability** that prevents **3 damage** from being dealt to any target this turn.
- **Samite Healer** is a **creature** with **2/2** toughness and **no abilities** (as per the description).
- **Bob's lands are tapped out**, so he has **no mana to cast spells**.
- **Alice has sufficient mana** to cast any spells.

## **Alice's Strategy: Killing Orim**

Alice wants to **kill Orim**, which is a **legendary creature** with **1/3 toughness**. She has **2 copies of Kindle**, and **Orim is a threat to her burn deck**.

### **Option 1: Use Kindle to deal damage to Orim**

- **Kindle** is an **instant** that deals **X damage**, where **X = 2 + number of Kindle in graveyards**.
- Since Alice has **2 copies of Kindle**, **X = 2 + 2 = 4**.
- So, **Kindle** deals **4 damage** to Orim.

### **Effect of Orim's Tap Ability**

- **Orim** has the ability: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."
- If Alice uses **Kindle** to deal **4 damage** to Orim, then **Orim will prevent 3 damage** from being dealt to any target this turn.
- So, **Orim will prevent 3 damage** from being dealt to any target this turn.

### **What Happens Next?**

- **Orim** is a **legendary creature** with **1/3 toughness**.
- If **Orim is damaged by 4 damage**, it will take **1 damage** (since 1/3 = 1/3, and 4 damage would reduce it to 1).
- **Orim will die** if it takes **1 damage**.

---

### **Option 2: Use Kindle to deal damage to Samite Healer**

- **Samite Healer** is a **2/2** creature with **no abilities**.
- If Alice uses **Kindle** to deal **4 damage** to Samite Healer, it will take **2 damage** (since 2/2 = 2).
- **Samite Healer** will die, but that's not directly relevant to Orim.

---

### **Option 3: Use Kindle to deal damage to Bob's lands**

- Bob has **no lands in play**, so he can't be damaged.
- This is not useful for killing Orim.

---

## **Bob's Strategy: Protecting Orim**

Bob has **Orim** in play, and **Samite Healer** is in play, **untapped**.

### **What is Bob's Goal?**

- Bob wants to **protect Orim** from being killed by Alice.
- He has **no lands in play**, so he can't use any mana to cast spells.

### **What Can Bob Do?**

- **Samite Healer** is a **2/2** creature with **no abilities**.
- **Orim** is a **1/3** toughness creature.
- **Kindle** is an **instant** that deals **4 damage** to Orim.

### **What Can Bob Do to Prevent Alice from Killing Orim?**

- Bob has **no lands**, so he can't use **Tap** to prevent damage.
- He can't use **Samite Healer** to prevent damage (it has no abilities).
- He can't use **Orim** to prevent damage (it has no abilities).

---

## **Optimal Play for Alice**

- **Use one Kindle** to deal **4 damage** to **Orim**.
- **Orim will prevent 3 damage**, so **Orim will take 1 damage** (since 4 - 3 = 1).
- **Orim will die**.
- **Alice wins**.

---

## **Optimal Play for Bob**

- **Bob has no lands**, so he can't cast any spells.
- **Samite Healer** is in play, but it has no abilities.
- **Orim** is in play, and it's **not vulnerable** to damage from **Kindle** (since it has 1/3 toughness).
- **Bob has no way to prevent Alice from killing Orim**.

---

## **Final Outcome**

- **Alice** uses **Kindle** to deal **4 damage** to **Orim**.
- **Orim prevents 3 damage**, so it takes **1 damage** and **dies**.
- **Bob** has no way to prevent this, and **Alice wins**.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Alice's optimal play**: Use **one Kindle** to deal **4 damage** to **Orim**.
- **Bob's optimal play**: Do nothing (he has no way to prevent Alice from killing Orim).
- **Alice wins** the game. [end of text]
