These questions aim to test a range of abilities, from basic knowledge recall to complex reasoning and creative problem-solving. The suggested answers provide a framework for evaluation, but some flexibility should be allowed for nuanced responses.  The difficulty increases progressively, and the mix of languages and topics should provide a good overall assessment of an LLM's capabilities. [end of text]
