Okay, so I have these two questions about water freezing. Let me try to figure them out. 

Starting with part A: Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius? I remember that the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius. So normally, water freezes at 0°C. But wait, sometimes water can get colder than that without freezing, right? That's called supercooling. So if water is supercooled, it stays liquid below 0°C. But at some point, it will freeze. So at -12°C, if the water is supercooled, it might still be liquid, but if it's not, it would have frozen at 0°C. So the answer is that pure water typically freezes at 0°C, but under certain conditions, it can stay liquid below that.

Now part B: I have a glass of pure water and cool it to -12°C. What happens? Well, if it's cooled slowly and allowed to freeze at 0°C, it would turn to ice. But if it's cooled quickly without letting it freeze, it might become supercooled. So at -12°C, it's likely supercooled and still liquid. But if it's disturbed, it would rapidly freeze. So the answer is that it would freeze, but if supercooled, it remains liquid until disturbed.

**Answer:**

A) Pure water typically freezes at 0°C. However, under certain conditions, such as supercooling, water can remain liquid below 0°C. At -12°C, if supercooled, it stays liquid but will freeze if disturbed.

B) When a glass of pure water is cooled to -12°C, it can become supercooled, remaining liquid. If disturbed, it rapidly freezes at this temperature. [end of text]
