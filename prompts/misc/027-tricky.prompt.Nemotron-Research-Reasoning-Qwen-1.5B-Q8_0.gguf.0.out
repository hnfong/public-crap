Okay, so I have these two questions to answer about water freezing. Let me think through them step by step.

Question A: Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius? Hmm. I remember that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. But wait, freezing point can vary depending on pressure. So if the pressure is lower, freezing point might be lower. For example, at higher pressure like atmospheric, it's 0°C. But if you lower the pressure, freezing point goes down. So at lower pressure, water freezes at lower temperatures. So at -12°C, is that under standard pressure? Or is it under different conditions?

Wait, freezing point is the temperature at which water turns to ice at a given pressure. So at standard atmospheric pressure (like 1 atm), water freezes at 0°C. If you have a pressure lower than atmospheric, freezing point would be lower. So if you have water at -12°C, it would be freezing under higher pressure? Or maybe the question is whether water freezes at -12°C under any condition.

But the question is phrased as "Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?" So I think it's asking if freezing occurs at that temperature. So freezing occurs when water turns to ice at its freezing point. So at 0°C under standard pressure, water freezes. So at -12°C, would it be freezing? Maybe not under standard conditions. Or perhaps the question is whether water can freeze at -12°C without changing pressure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is whether water freezes at -12°C. So freezing point is 0°C normally. So at -12, it's below freezing under standard conditions. So water wouldn't freeze at that temperature unless pressure is lower.

But the question is phrased as "Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?" So perhaps it's a yes or no question. So I think the answer is no, because water freezes at 0°C under standard pressure. So at -12, it's below freezing unless pressure is lower.

But wait, maybe the question is about whether water can freeze at -12°C. So perhaps it's about the possibility. So if you have water at -12°C and lower it, would it freeze? Or perhaps it's about whether water can reach freezing point at that temp.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is no. Because water freezes at 0°C under standard pressure. So at -12, it's colder than freezing point under normal conditions. So water would be freezing if cooled below 0°C under standard pressure. But the question is phrased as "Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?" So perhaps it's asking whether water freezes at that temperature. So the answer would be no, because freezing occurs at 0°C under standard pressure.

So answer A: No, water doesn't freeze at -12°C under standard conditions. But wait, maybe the question is more general. It could be asking whether water can freeze at -12°C without changing pressure. So if you have water at -12°C and lower the temperature, would it freeze? Or perhaps it's about whether it's possible for water to freeze at that temperature.

But perhaps the question is simply whether water freezes at -12°C. So the freezing point is 0°C. So at -12, it's below freezing. So water doesn't freeze at that temperature. So answer is no.

So A) No, water doesn't freeze at -12°C under standard conditions.

Now question B: I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?

So pure water at -12°C. So water freezes at 0°C. So cooling below freezing would cause water to freeze. So when you lower the temperature below 0°C, water will freeze. So the water will form ice.

But wait, pure water? So if you have pure water at -12°C, and you cool it down to -12, it's already at that temperature. So would it freeze? Or does freezing occur when it's cooled below 0?

So when you have water at 0°C and cool it below, it freezes. So if you have water at -12°C, and you cool it further below 0, it would freeze. But if you just cool it to -12, it's already at that point. So perhaps it would freeze.

But wait, the question says cooled down to -12. So starting from pure water at higher temp? Or initial state is pure water at room temp? Maybe the question is that you have pure water at room temp, and you cool it to -12. So what happens?

So if you have pure water at higher temp than 0°C, and you cool it to -12, it will freeze. So water will form ice.

So the process would be: cooling causes water to freeze at 0°C. So at -12, which is below freezing point under standard pressure, so water will freeze.

So the result would be ice forms.

So putting it together:

A) Does water freeze at -12°C? No, because freezing point is 0°C under standard pressure. So answer is no.

B) Cooling pure water to -12°C would cause it to freeze, forming ice.

So let me structure the answers.

For A: Water freezes at 0°C under standard pressure. So at -12°C, it doesn't freeze under standard conditions. So answer is no.

For B: Cooling pure water to -12°C would cause it to freeze. So water would form ice.

So now to write the explanations.

For A: The freezing point of water is 0°C at standard atmospheric pressure. So at -12°C, water does not freeze under standard conditions. So answer is no.

For B: When you cool pure water to -12°C, since freezing point is 0°C, water will freeze. So it will form ice.

So putting the answers in brief.

A) No, water does not freeze at -12°C under standard conditions.

B) When cooled to -12°C, water will freeze, forming ice.
</think>

A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius under standard conditions because the freezing point is 0°C.

B) When cooled to -12°C, the water will freeze, forming ice.

**Explanation:**
A) The freezing point of water is 0°C under standard atmospheric pressure. At -12°C, water does not freeze under these conditions.

B) Cooling pure water to -12°C causes it to freeze, forming ice as water turns into ice at its freezing point.

**Answer:**

A) No, water does not freeze at -12°C under standard conditions.

B) Cooling to -12°C causes water to freeze, forming ice.

So the final answers are:

A) No, water does not freeze at -12°C.

B) Water freezes at -12°C, forming ice.

But since the question asks for brief explanations, the concise answers are:

A) Water freezes at 0°C, so at -12°C it does not freeze under standard conditions.

B) Cooling to -12°C causes freezing, so water freezes and ice forms.

So the explanations are:

A) Water freezes at 0°C, so at -12°C it does not freeze under standard pressure.

B) Cooling to -12°C causes freezing, so water freezes and ice forms.

So the final answer is:

A) No, water does not freeze at -12°C under standard conditions.

B) When cooled to -12°C, water freezes and forms ice.

So to present the answers as per instructions:

A) No, water does not freeze at -12°C.

B) Cooling to -12°C causes water to freeze, forming ice.

So the boxed answers would be:

A) \boxed{\text{No}}

B) \boxed{\text{Water freezes and ice forms}}

But since the user asked to provide brief explanations with explanations, perhaps the answers are:

A) Water freezes at 0°C, so at -12°C it does not freeze under standard conditions.

B) Cooling to -12°C causes freezing, so water freezes and ice forms.

So the concise answers:

A) No, water does not freeze at -12°C under standard conditions.

B) Cooling to -12°C causes water to freeze, forming ice.

So the final answer format:

A) \boxed{\text{No}}

B) \boxed{\text{Water freezes and ice forms at -12°C}}

Alternatively, since the user asked to answer with brief explanations, perhaps:

A) Water freezes at 0°C, so at -12°C it does not freeze under standard conditions.

B) Cooling to -12°C causes freezing, so water freezes and ice forms.

So the explanations are as above.
</think>

A) Water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius under standard conditions. The freezing point of water is 0°C at standard atmospheric pressure.

B) When cooled to -12°C, water will freeze, forming ice.

**Explanation:**
A) The freezing point of water is 0°C under standard pressure. At -12°C, water does not freeze.

**Final Answer:**

A) No, water does not freeze at -12°C under standard conditions.

B) Cooling to -12
