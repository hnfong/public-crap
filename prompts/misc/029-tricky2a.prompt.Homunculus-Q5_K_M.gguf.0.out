Alice is correct in stating that water freezes at **0 degrees Celsius** under standard atmospheric pressure. This is the **normal freezing point** of water.

Bob is **technically incorrect** in saying that water freezes at -10Â°C, unless under **special conditions** (like high pressure or impurities), which were not mentioned in the conversation.

So, **Alice is right**. [end of text]
