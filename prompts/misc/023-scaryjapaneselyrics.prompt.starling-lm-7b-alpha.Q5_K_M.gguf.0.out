Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Give me your interpretation. You do not have to translate the contents, but you may if you wish.

Here's a possible interpretation of the lyrics:

The story takes place in a small forest restaurant that no one has reserved. It's lunchtime, and the place is empty, with only small birds laughing and fluttering around. The menu consists of only one recommended dish, and you can hear the sounds of a violin, flute, and cello coming from the kitchen.

Welcome, everyone! After eating, it's time to take a nap. So, goodbye for now. Tomorrow is another day, and so on. The performance begins from right to left, with even the bear-riding dancers joining in. The show includes a variety of acts, such as the "Carpachio" (a play on the Italian dish "Carbonara"), "Paerlia" (a play on "Pasta"), and "Oudoble" (a play on "Doble," a Spanish dish). However, there are no desserts or resets available. The performance aims to reach the graveyard, and tonight's show is the last full course.

This interpretation is based on the fantastical elements in the lyrics, but it can also be understood as a metaphor for life's journey, with the small forest restaurant representing a temporary stop on the way, and the various acts symbolizing the different stages of life.
