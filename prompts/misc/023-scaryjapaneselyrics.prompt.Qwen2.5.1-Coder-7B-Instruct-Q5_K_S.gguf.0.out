The lyrics describe a fantastical setting, likely a magical forest or a fairy tale world, where a small restaurant is the center of activity. Here's an interpretation of the story:

In this whimsical world, there is a small restaurant hidden deep within a dense forest. The restaurant is peculiar in that it has no reservations and is always filled with empty tables, suggesting that it's a place where people come to enjoy a meal without the usual worries of making a reservation or waiting in line.

The restaurant is decorated with a bright red penquin roof, which adds a playful and whimsical touch to the setting. The menu is simple, consisting only of recommended dishes, indicating that the restaurant caters to a specific taste or preference.

The kitchen is bustling with activity, with musicians playing various instruments such as a violin, flute, cello, and viola. This suggests that the restaurant is not just a place to eat but also a gathering spot for musicians and performers.

The lyrics also mention a bear dancing from right to left, which adds to the mischievous and playful atmosphere of the restaurant. The bear's dance is described as "hand-throwing," which could be interpreted as a playful and carefree movement.

The restaurant is also described as having no desserts, which could be interpreted as a way to encourage customers to enjoy their meal thoroughly before leaving. The final line, "お墓の中まで届けましょう" (Let's deliver it all the way to the grave), suggests that the restaurant is a place where customers can enjoy their meal to the fullest, without worrying about anything else.

Overall, the lyrics paint a picture of a magical and whimsical world where people come to enjoy a meal without the usual worries of life. The restaurant is a place of fun, music, and carefree enjoyment, where customers can let loose and have a good time. [end of text]
