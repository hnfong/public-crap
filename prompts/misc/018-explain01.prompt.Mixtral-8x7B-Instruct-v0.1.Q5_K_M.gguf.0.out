Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.
 [/INST] Aight, listen up, my man, I got a little lesson for ya,
'Bout this thing called the Federal Reserve, it's kinda a big deal, ya hear me?

So, imagine you got a big bank, but it ain't just any bank,
It's where the government keeps its money, it's where the big dogs tank.

Now, this bank's job is to make sure the economy's straight,
It controls the money supply, so there's never too much or too little weight.

When times are tough, and the economy's in a funk,
The Federal Reserve can lower interest rates, so banks don't choke up.

This encourages borrowing, which means more spending,
And more spending can lead to more jobs, and that's a winning.

But if the economy's too hot, and inflation's on the rise,
The Federal Reserve can raise interest rates, to cool things down and stabilize.

It's like a thermostat, controlling the temperature,
Making sure the economy's growth is just right, not too fast or too slow, fam.

So, that's the Federal Reserve, in a nutshell, my man,
Controlling the money supply, keeping the economy in demand.

It's a complex system, but that's the gist, my friend,
The Federal Reserve, it's there to make sure the economy never ends. [end of text]
