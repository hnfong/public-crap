A) Water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. The temperature at which water freezes can be affected by impurities in the water (supercooling can cause water to remain liquid below 0°C), but pure water will freeze at 0°C.

B) If a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, it would become a solid, more specifically, it would turn into ice. This process occurs because the water molecules slow down and form a crystalline structure as they freeze. Since the water is pure, it should freeze at 0°C, but if it's carefully and slowly cooled, it could remain liquid until it reaches its freezing point, a phenomenon known as supercooling. Once the temperature reaches 0°C or below, the water will freeze. At -12°C, the water has been well below its freezing point for a while, and it would have turned into ice unless the conditions were such that it remained a supercooled liquid. [end of text]
