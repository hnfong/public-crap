Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Give me your interpretation. You do not have to translate the contents, but you may if you wish.

The lyrics tell a story of a whimsical and lighthearted journey through a fantastical forest. The protagonist, a young traveler, is on a mission to find a small, charming restaurant in the woods. The restaurant is known for its delicious food, but the protagonist is not sure if it has any reservations available.

As the protagonist wanders through the forest, they come across various obstacles and encounters, including a mischievous bird that seems to be enjoying the protagonist's antics. The protagonist eventually finds the restaurant, but it's a tiny, empty one with a red-painted ceiling.

Despite the restaurant's empty state, the protagonist decides to take a seat and enjoy the meal. The restaurant's menu is filled with various dishes, and the protagonist chooses to try them all. The protagonist then takes a nap, and when they wake up, the restaurant is filled with guests, including a lively band playing music.

The protagonist is delighted by the unexpected turn of events and decides to join in the celebration. The story concludes with the protagonist wishing everyone a good night and a sweet dream, and the final line, "最後のフルコース," which can be translated as "the last full moon."

One possible literal interpretation of the lyrics in a fantastical setting is that the protagonist is on a journey to find a magical restaurant that exists in a dream world. The restaurant is known for its enchanted food, but the protagonist is unsure if it has any reservations available. Despite the restaurant's empty state, the protagonist decides to take a seat and enjoy the meal, which is filled with magical dishes. The protagonist then takes a nap, and when they wake up, the restaurant is filled with guests, including a lively band playing music. The protagonist is delighted by the unexpected turn of events and decides to join in the celebration, wishing everyone a good night and a sweet dream. [end of text]
