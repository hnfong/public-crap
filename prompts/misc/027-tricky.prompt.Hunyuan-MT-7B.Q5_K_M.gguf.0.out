A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of pure water is 0 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure. Water freezes at lower temperatures under certain conditions, such as when there is impurities in it or when the pressure is reduced.

B) If a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will freeze. At this temperature, the water molecules will slow down their movement and start to form ice crystals. The water will gradually solidify into ice. However, it is important to note that the process of freezing can be slow and may take several hours or even days, depending on the initial temperature of the water and the surrounding conditions.
