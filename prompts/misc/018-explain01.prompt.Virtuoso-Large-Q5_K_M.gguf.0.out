(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, let me break it down,  
Federal Reserve, they run the financial town.  
Think of 'em like the DJ, mixin' the economy's sound,  
Keepin' the flow smooth, so we don't hit the ground.

(Chorus)
Fed's the one, keepin' the cash flowin',  
Makin' sure the banks ain't closin',  
They set the rates, keep inflation lowin',  
Keepin' the streets steady, so the dough keeps growin'.

(Verse 2)
They got the power to print that green,  
But they gotta be careful, can't go too extreme.  
If they print too much, the value might seem,  
Like a rapper's fame, it could fade in a dream.

(Chorus)
Fed's the one, keepin' the cash flowin',  
Makin' sure the banks ain't closin',  
They set the rates, keep inflation lowin',  
Keepin' the streets steady, so the dough keeps growin'.

(Bridge)
When the economy's hot, they might raise the rate,  
Cool it down, so we don't hit that inflation gate.  
When it's cold, they lower it, to stimulate,  
Get the money movin', like a beat that's great.

(Outro)
So when you hear 'bout the Fed, now you know,  
They're the ones keepin' the financial show.  
Makin' sure the economy's on the go,  
Keepin' it real, so we all can grow. [end of text]
