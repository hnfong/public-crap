Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Give me your interpretation. You do not have to translate the contents, but you may if you wish.

The lyrics tell a story about a small restaurant in the forest that is difficult to find, even when following acorns. The restaurant is empty, with no reservations, and the only sound comes from the kitchen where musicians are playing violin, flute, cello, and viola. The menu is limited to one recommendation, and the restaurant is painted red with a tiled roof. The lyrics suggest that the food served at the restaurant, tarafuku, makes people sleepy, and the restaurant welcomes everyone, saying goodbye with the phrase "et cetera" (meaning "and so on" in Latin). The lyrics also mention that the restaurant will deliver food to the graveyard, as it is the last full course for the night. The overall tone of the lyrics is lighthearted and slightly mischievous, with a fantastical setting that includes a small restaurant in the forest, acorns leading the way, and musicians playing in the kitchen.
