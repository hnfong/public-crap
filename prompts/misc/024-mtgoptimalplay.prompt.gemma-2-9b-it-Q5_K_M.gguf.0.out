Here's a breakdown of the optimal play for both players:

**Alice's Thought Process:**

* **Goal:** Eliminate Orim, Samite Healer.
* **Challenge:** Orim's ability prevents 3 damage.
* **Solution:**  Alice needs to deal more than 3 damage to Orim in a single instance.

**Alice's Optimal Play:**

1. **Cast both Kindle spells.**  Since each Kindle deals 2 + the number of Kindles in graveyards, both spells will deal 4 damage each (2 + 2).

**Outcome of Alice's Play:**

* Orim's ability will prevent 3 damage from each Kindle.
* This leaves 1 damage from each Kindle, totaling 2 damage to Orim.
* Orim, Samite Healer will be destroyed.

**Bob's Thought Process:**

* **Goal:** Protect Orim, Samite Healer.
* **Challenge:** Alice has two Kindles, potentially dealing more than 3 damage.

**Bob's Optimal Play:**

* **There is no play Bob can make to save Orim.**  He has no cards in hand and his lands are tapped out.

**Final Outcome:**

Alice successfully destroys Orim, Samite Healer, clearing the path for her burn strategy.
