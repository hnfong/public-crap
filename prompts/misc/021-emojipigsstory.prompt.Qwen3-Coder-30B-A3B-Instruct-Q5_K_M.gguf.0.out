Little pigs lived in 🏠🏠🏠
One day, 🐷 went to 🏠🏠🏠
Another pig went to 🏠🏠🏠
Third pig went to 🏠🏠🏠

Then came 🐧🐺🐺🐺
Knock knock knock 🚪🚪🚪
Pig said 👋👋👋
Wolf said 🐾🐾🐾

First pig ran 🏃🏃🏃
Second pig ran 🏃🏃🏃
Third pig ran 🏃🏃🏃

Wolf chased 🐾🐾🐾
But third pig built 🏠🏠🏠
Wolf tried 🔥🔥🔥
But house was strong 🏠🏠🏠

Wolf fell 🪐🪐🪐
Pigs laughed 😄😄😄
They lived happily ever after 🏡🏡🏡
