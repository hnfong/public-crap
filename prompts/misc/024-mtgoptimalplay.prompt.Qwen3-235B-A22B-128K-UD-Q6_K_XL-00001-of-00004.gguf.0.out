Let's analyze this situation in **Magic: The Gathering** using the **rules as of 2024**, and determine the **optimal play** for both players.

---

### 🧩 Game State Summary:

- **Alice** has:
  - Two copies of **Kindle** in her **hand**.
  - Sufficient mana to cast any spells.
  - It's **her turn** (so she controls the turn sequence).

- **Bob** has:
  - No cards in hand.
  - **Orim, Samite Healer** on the battlefield.
  - Orim is **untapped**.
  - Bob has **no mana available** (his lands are tapped out).
  - Orim has been in play long enough to be unaffected by summoning sickness.

---

### 📜 Card Details:

#### **Kindle** (Instant)
> **Mana Cost:** {R}  
> **Effect:** Kindle deals **X damage** to any target, where **X = 2 + the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards**.

#### **Orim, Samite Healer** (Legendary Creature — Human Cleric)
> **Mana Cost:** {1}{W}  
> **Power/Toughness:** 1/3  
> **Ability:** {T}: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to **any target** this turn.

---

### 🎯 Objective:

Alice wants to **kill Orim** using her two Kindle spells.

Bob wants to **keep Orim alive**.

---

## 🧠 Optimal Play Analysis

### Step 1: Understanding Kindle's Damage

The key to this puzzle is that **Kindle's damage depends on how many Kindles are in graveyards** when it resolves.

- Initially, **zero Kindles** are in graveyards.
- So, the first Kindle cast will deal **2 damage**.
- If the first Kindle is put into the graveyard (which it will be when it resolves), then the second Kindle will deal **3 damage** (2 + 1 in graveyard).

---

### Step 2: Alice's Options

Alice can cast both Kindles during her turn. She can do this in one of two ways:

1. **Cast both Kindles in succession during her main phase.**
2. **Cast one Kindle during her main phase, and the second during the combat phase or after combat.**

But since Orim is a **creature**, and the goal is to **deal lethal damage to it**, we need to consider how Orim's ability interacts with this.

---

### Step 3: Orim's Ability

Orim has a **tap ability** that **prevents the next 3 damage** that would be dealt to **any target** this turn.

- This includes damage to **Bob**, **Orim**, or any other creature or player.
- The prevention is **not limited to one target**.
- Once used, the ability is **on the stack** and resolves unless countered.
- Importantly, **Bob controls Orim**, so **he chooses when to activate its ability**.

---

### Step 4: Turn Structure and Stack Priority

It's **Alice's turn**, so she gets to cast spells first in her phases.

- She can cast the first **Kindle** targeting **Orim**.
- The spell resolves unless Bob responds.
- Bob has **no cards in hand**, so he can't counter the spell.
- But he **can activate Orim's ability** in response to the first Kindle.

## 🧮 Calculating the Damage

Let’s walk through the sequence step by step.

---

### ✅ Optimal Play for Alice:

1. **Cast Kindle #1 targeting Orim.**
2. Bob **activates Orim's ability** in response (he taps Orim to prevent the next 3 damage to any target this turn).
3. Kindle #1 resolves and would deal **2 damage** to Orim, but **Orim's ability prevents all 2 damage**.
4. Now, **Kindle #1 has resolved**, and is in the graveyard.
5. So, **X = 3** for the second Kindle (2 + 1 in graveyard).
6. Alice **casts Kindle #2**, again targeting Orim.
7. Bob has **no mana left**, and **no cards in hand**, so he **cannot respond**.
8. Kindle #2 resolves and deals **3 damage** to Orim.
9. Orim has **3 toughness**, and has taken **3 damage** this turn (all prevented from the first spell), but now receives **3 more** from the second Kindle.
10. **Total damage dealt to Orim this turn: 3 (from Kindle #2)**.
11. Since Orim's ability only prevents **3 damage**, and it was already used to prevent the first 2, it **cannot prevent the second 3 damage**.
12. **Orim dies**.

---

### ✅ Optimal Play for Bob:

- Bob knows that Kindle's damage increases if one is in the graveyard.
- He wants to **maximize the usefulness of Orim's prevention ability**.
- His best move is to **tap Orim in response to the first Kindle**, preventing the **2 damage**.
- He cannot do anything about the second Kindle, since:
  - He has **no mana** to activate Orim again (tapping it requires mana, which he doesn’t have).
  - He has **no other responses** (no cards in hand).
- He cannot prevent the **3 damage** from the second Kindle.

---

## 📜 MTG Rules Reference (2024)

- **608.2g**: When a spell or ability resolves, it checks the total damage that would be dealt, and prevention effects are applied before assigning damage.
- **615.5**: Prevention effects are applied in **timestamp order**, meaning the first prevention effect applies first.
- **615.6**: If a prevention effect prevents **some but not all** damage, the remaining damage is dealt normally.
- **601.2a**: Alice, as the active player, gets priority first in her turn phases.
- **117.3b**: Orim’s ability is a **mana-activated ability**, so Bob must have mana to use it again.

---

## ✅ Final Outcome

- **Orim survives the first Kindle** (2 damage prevented).
- **The second Kindle deals 3 damage**, which **cannot be prevented**.
- **Orim takes 3 damage and dies** (1/3 creature, 3 damage total this turn).

## 🧾 Summary

| Step | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Alice casts Kindle #1 targeting Orim | Deals 2 damage |
| 2 | Bob activates Orim’s tap ability | Prevents 2 damage |
| 3 | Kindle #1 resolves | No damage dealt to Orim |
| 4 | Kindle #1 goes to graveyard | Now 1 Kindle in graveyard |
| 5 | Alice casts Kindle #2 targeting Orim | Deals 3 damage |
| 6 | No response from Bob | Kindle #2 resolves |
| 7 | Orim takes 3 damage | Total damage = 3 |
| 8 | Orim dies | 1/3 toughness, lethal damage |

---

## 🏁 Conclusion

**Optimal play for Alice:**  
Cast both Kindles, one after the other, targeting Orim. The first will be prevented, the second will kill Orim.

**Optimal play for Bob:**  
Activate Orim’s ability in response to the first Kindle to prevent the initial 2 damage.

**Final Result:**  
**Orim, Samite Healer dies** from the second Kindle's 3 damage.

This is a clever interaction where **Alice uses the increasing value of Kindle** by manipulating the **number of Kindles in graveyards**, and **Bob can only prevent one instance** of damage due to limited resources.

Let me know if you'd like to explore variations (e.g., if Bob had mana or a counterspell)! [end of text]
