A) **Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?**

Yes, water freezes at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of pure water is 0 degrees Celsius, but under certain conditions (such as the presence of impurities or increased pressure), water can freeze at lower temperatures. At -12 degrees Celsius, water will be solid ice.

B) **I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?**

If the glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, the water will freeze into ice. Since the temperature is well below the freezing point of 0 degrees Celsius, the water molecules will slow down, arrange themselves in a crystalline structure, and form solid ice. [end of text]
