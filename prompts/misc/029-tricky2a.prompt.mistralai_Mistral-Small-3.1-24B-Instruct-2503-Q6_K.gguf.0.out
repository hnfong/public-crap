Both Alice and Bob are partially correct, but Bob's statement needs clarification.

- **Alice** is correct that the freezing point of pure water at standard atmospheric pressure is 0 degrees Celsius.
- **Bob** is also correct in a broader sense because water can indeed freeze at -10 degrees Celsius, but this typically occurs under specific conditions. For example, water can supercool (remain liquid below its freezing point) until it is disturbed or seeded with a nucleation site, at which point it will rapidly freeze. Additionally, water can freeze at -10 degrees Celsius if it contains impurities or is under pressure, which can lower the freezing point.

So, while pure water at standard pressure freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, water can freeze at -10 degrees Celsius under certain conditions. [end of text]
