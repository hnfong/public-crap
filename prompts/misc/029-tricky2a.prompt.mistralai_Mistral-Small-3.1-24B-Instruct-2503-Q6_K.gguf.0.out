Bob is correct. While it is true that water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure, it can remain liquid at temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius in a process known as supercooling. However, at -10 degrees Celsius, water will almost always freeze, especially if there are any impurities or nucleation sites present. Therefore, under normal conditions, water at -10 degrees Celsius will indeed freeze. [end of text]
