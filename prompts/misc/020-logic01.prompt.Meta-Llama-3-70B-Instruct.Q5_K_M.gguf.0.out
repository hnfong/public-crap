If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

When a theory proves itself, it's actually a sign of inconsistency, not consistency or tautology. Here's why:

1. **Consistency**: A consistent theory is one where no contradiction can be derived from its axioms and rules of inference. In other words, a consistent theory is one where it's not possible to prove both a statement and its negation.
2. **Tautology**: A tautology is a statement that is always true by definition, often considered trivial or uninteresting. For example, "all bachelors are unmarried" is a tautology because it's a definition of a bachelor.
3. **Self-proving theory**: A self-proving theory, also known as a "self-verifying" or "self-justifying" theory, is one where the theory proves its own truth or consistency. This might seem appealing, but it's actually a sign of trouble.

The issue with self-proving theories is that they often rely on circular reasoning or begging the question. In other words, the theory is using its own assumptions or axioms to prove itself, which is not a valid form of argumentation. This can lead to inconsistencies and contradictions.

Here are some examples of self-proving theories or arguments that are actually problematic:

* ** Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems**: Gödel's first incompleteness theorem shows that any formal system powerful enough to describe basic arithmetic is either incomplete or inconsistent. One way to interpret this result is that any self-proving theory of arithmetic is actually inconsistent.
* **Naive set theory**: The naive set theory, which allows for unrestricted set formation, leads to Russell's paradox. This paradox arises when considering the set of all sets that do not contain themselves, which leads to a contradiction. Naive set theory can be seen as a self-proving theory, as it tries to define sets using its own rules, but ultimately leads to inconsistency.
* **Epimenides paradox**: This ancient paradox states, "This sentence is false." If the sentence is true, then it must be false, but if it's false, then it must be true. This creates an infinite loop of contradictions, making the statement self-referentially inconsistent.
* **Liar paradox**: Similar to the Epimenides paradox, the liar paradox states, "This sentence is not true." Again, this leads to a contradiction, as the sentence cannot be both true and not true at the same time.

In each of these examples, the self-proving nature of the theory or argument leads to inconsistencies or contradictions. Therefore, it's essential to approach self-proving theories with caution and carefully examine their underlying assumptions and logical structures to avoid falling into these pitfalls.
