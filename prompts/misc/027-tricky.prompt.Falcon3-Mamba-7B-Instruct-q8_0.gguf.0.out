A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. At -12 degrees Celsius, water remains in its liquid state.

B) If you have a glass of pure water and cool it down to -12 degrees Celsius, the water will freeze and turn into ice. The temperature of -12 degrees Celsius is below the freezing point of water, so the water molecules will slow down enough to form a crystalline structure, characteristic of ice. This process will continue until all the water has frozen or the temperature is raised above 0 degrees Celsius. [end of text]
