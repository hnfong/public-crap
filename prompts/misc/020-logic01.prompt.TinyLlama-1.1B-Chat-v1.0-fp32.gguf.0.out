If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

Sure! Tautology is a logical statement or theory that is true because it is a consequence of another true statement. For example, "All dogs are dogs" is a tautology because it is a logical consequence of the fact that all dogs are animals. 

On the other hand, a theory that proves itself is called "consistent" because it is a consequence of all true statements. For instance, the theory of relativity, which states that all observed events are relative to the motion of the observer, is consistent. The theory of quantum mechanics, which describes the behavior of subatomic particles, is also consistent.

Several theories, including those in physics, biology, and psychology, are tautologies because they are consistent. However, some theories are also consistent but not tautological, such as the theory of evolution or the theory of mind.

Therefore, depending on the context, it is appropriate to refer to these theories as "consistent" or "tautological." However, in general, it is common to refer to these theories as "logically consistent" or "logically tautological."</s>
