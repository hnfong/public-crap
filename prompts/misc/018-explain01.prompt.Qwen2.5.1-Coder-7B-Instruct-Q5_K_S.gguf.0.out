Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

Yo, listen up, I'm gonna drop some knowledge on you, 'bout the Federal Reserve, that's the bank that controls the money supply in the United States. They're like the king of the economy, they make sure everything runs smoothly.
Think of it like this, the Federal Reserve is like the DJ at a party, they control the tempo of the economy. They can raise or lower interest rates, which is like turning up or down the volume on the music. When they raise interest rates, it's like turning down the volume, it makes borrowing money more expensive, which slows down the economy. When they lower interest rates, it's like turning up the volume, it makes borrowing money cheaper, which speeds up the economy.
The Federal Reserve also sets monetary policy, which is like the rules of the game. They decide how much money to print and how to distribute it, which helps to keep prices stable and prevent inflation.
So, in short, the Federal Reserve is like the captain of the ship, they steer the economy and make sure everything runs smoothly. They're a powerful force, and they have a big impact on the lives of everyone in the country. [end of text]
