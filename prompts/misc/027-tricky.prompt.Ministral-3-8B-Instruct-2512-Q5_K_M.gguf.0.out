A) **No**, water does not freeze at **-12°C** under standard conditions. Pure water freezes at **0°C (32°F)** at **standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm)**. Below 0°C, it enters a **supercooled** state (liquid water below its freezing point) unless nucleation occurs (e.g., from impurities, bubbles, or vibrations).

B) **If cooled to -12°C**:
   - The **pure water remains liquid** (supercooled) unless triggered to freeze.
   - Supercooling is unstable—any disturbance (e.g., shaking, adding a seed crystal, or introducing dust) will cause **instantaneous freezing** (often explosively, releasing latent heat).
   - Without nucleation, the water stays liquid until it reaches the **homogeneous nucleation temperature** (~−42°C for pure water), where it freezes spontaneously. [end of text]
