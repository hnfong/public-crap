The lyrics you've provided are from a Japanese song with a lighthearted and slightly mischievous tone. The song paints a whimsical, fantastical scene set in a "forest restaurant," which serves as the central setting for the story. While the lyrics are poetic and metaphorical, they also contain elements that can be interpreted in a literal, fantastical way.

### Interpretation:

The song tells the story of a **magical forest restaurant** that exists in a strange, surreal world. It is a place where time and reality are not bound by normal rules. The restaurant is always full of empty seats, and it serves food that is both strange and mysterious. The "menu" is limited to just "recommended" dishes, and the kitchen is filled with unusual instruments like a violin, flute, cello, and viola — suggesting that the restaurant is not just a place to eat, but also a place where music and magic are intertwined.

The song also hints at a **mysterious or supernatural element**. The line *"お墓の中まで届けましょう 今宵は最後のフルコース"* ("Let's deliver it even to the grave — tonight is the final course") suggests that the restaurant may be connected to the afterlife or some other dimension. It could be a place where the dead or the forgotten are served, or where the boundaries between life and death are blurred.

The phrase *"右から左へおおわらわ"* ("From right to left, oh wow") and the image of a "hand-riding bear" dancing suggest that the restaurant is a place of **playful, surreal magic**, where the rules of the world are different. The absence of dessert and the mention of "no dessert" could imply that the restaurant is a place of **limited offerings**, or that the food is not meant to be eaten in the usual way.

### Summary:

The song tells the story of a **magical, surreal forest restaurant** that exists in a world where time, reality, and the boundaries between life and death are not fixed. It is a place where food is served in a strange, whimsical way, and where the guests are not just humans but perhaps even the forgotten or the lost. The restaurant is a place of **playful mischief**, where the food is magical, the music is strange, and the guests are invited to enjoy a final, mysterious meal — possibly even one that transcends the normal world.

In a fantastical setting, this could be a **restaurant for the dead**, a **place where forgotten souls are served**, or a **magical realm where the rules of reality are different**. The song is a playful, surreal journey through a world where food, music, and magic are all intertwined. [end of text]
