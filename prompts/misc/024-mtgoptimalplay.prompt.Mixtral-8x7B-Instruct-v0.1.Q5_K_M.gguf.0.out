 On Alice's turn, she has two 'Kindle' cards in her hand and wants to kill Bob's 'Orim, Samite Healer'. To do this optimally, she should cast both 'Kindle' spells in a single turn. Here's how the process would work:

1. Alice taps her lands to cast the first 'Kindle' card, targeting Orim. At this point, the damage would be 2 + 0 (since there is only one 'Kindle' in all graveyards).
2. Before damage is dealt, Bob activates Orim's ability, tapping her and preventing the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.
3. Damage is dealt, and Orim takes 2 damage, but no further damage can be dealt to her this turn due to her ability.
4. Alice then casts her second 'Kindle' card, again targeting Orim. At this point, the damage would be 2 + 1 (since there is now one 'Kindle' in Alice's graveyard).
5. Orim's ability has already been used this turn, so it cannot prevent the damage.
6. Damage is dealt, and Orim takes 3 damage, which is enough to kill her.

Bob's best play in this situation would be to activate Orim's ability as soon as Alice casts her first 'Kindle' spell. This will prevent the damage from that spell, but it will not prevent the damage from the second 'Kindle' spell. Since Bob's lands are tapped out, he cannot play any spells or abilities that could protect Orim further.

In summary, Alice can kill Orim by casting both 'Kindle' spells in a single turn, and Bob's best play is to use Orim's ability as soon as possible to prevent some of the damage. [end of text]
