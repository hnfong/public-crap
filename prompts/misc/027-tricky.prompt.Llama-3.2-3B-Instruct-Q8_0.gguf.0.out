Here are the answers:

A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) at standard atmospheric pressure.

B) If you cool a glass of pure water down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will not freeze. At this temperature, the water will be in a supercooled state, meaning it is below its freezing point but still liquid. This is because the molecules are moving too fast to form ice crystals, and the water remains in a metastable state. If you then disturb the water, such as by shaking the glass or introducing a nucleation site, the water will rapidly freeze. [end of text]
