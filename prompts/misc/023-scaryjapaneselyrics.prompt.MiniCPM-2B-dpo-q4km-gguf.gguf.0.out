 <用户>Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Give me your interpretation. You do not have to translate the contents, but you may if you wish.

<AI> Based on the lyrics provided, the story appears to be about a person who stumbles upon a small, hidden restaurant in a forest. The restaurant is a whimsical, magical place with a pen-like sign and a menu that seems to be all about the same dish, the "pen-shaped" pen-kini. The kitchen is filled with various instruments, such as a violin, a flute, a cello, and a violin, creating a magical atmosphere.

The protagonist is excited to try the pen-shaped pen-kini and enjoys the meal, falling asleep afterward. The song then continues with the protagonist's journey through the forest, encountering various creatures, including a bear who performs a dance. The restaurant is the only place in the forest with an open table, and the protagonist feels a sense of comfort and happiness.

The song concludes with the protagonist's farewell to the forest and the promise to return, even though there is no reservation or specific dessert. The story is about the joy of discovering a hidden gem, the magic of the forest, and the comfort of a warm meal. The pen-shaped pen-kini represents the simplicity and comfort of the restaurant, while the various instruments in the kitchen symbolize the diverse and enchanting atmosphere of the place.
