A) Yes, water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. At -12 degrees Celsius, water is well below its freezing point, so it would be frozen.

B) If a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will freeze and turn into ice. At this temperature, the water molecules lose enough kinetic energy to form a solid crystalline structure, resulting in ice. [end of text]
