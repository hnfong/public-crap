Imagine the biggest classroom in the whole of China, with thousands of grown-ups sitting in neat rows.  
Those grown-ups are called the National People’s Congress, or “NPC” for short.

Their job is a bit like the teachers and helpers at your school:

1. They listen to what everyone in China needs—just like your teachers ask, “Are you hungry? Do you need new crayons?”  
2. They make the big rules for the whole country—like deciding bedtime for everyone or how to keep the streets clean.  
3. They pick the most important grown-ups to look after China—like choosing the head teacher and the dinner-lady-in-chief.

So, the NPC is China’s giant “school council” that meets once a year to make sure all 1.4 billion children and grown-ups in China are safe, happy, and have what they need. [end of text]
