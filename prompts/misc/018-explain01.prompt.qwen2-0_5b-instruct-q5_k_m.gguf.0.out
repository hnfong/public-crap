Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

Yo, ain't nobody better than the Fed, no matter how rappy you are!
It's like a big machine, they make all the money, like a giant pump.
They regulate the banks, like they keep the money moving, just right.
The fed's got a job to do, to keep the economy rolling, like a well-oiled machine.
So let's keep our heads down, and let's keep our heads up, like the Fed's got our backs.
It's a big responsibility, and it's a tough job, just like the rapper's gotta do, but at least we know it's gonna be good for the country.
