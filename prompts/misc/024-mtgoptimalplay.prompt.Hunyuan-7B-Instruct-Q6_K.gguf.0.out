This is an interesting scenario that involves a mix of card effects, graveyard interactions, and strategic thinking. Let’s break it down step by step for both Alice and Bob, considering the mechanics of Magic: The Gathering as of 2024.

### **Alice's Optimal Play**
Alice has two copies of the **Kindle** card in her hand. The key mechanic of the Kindle is that it deals damage to a target equal to **2 plus the number of cards named "Kindle" in all graveyards**. Since Alice has two copies of the Kindle in her hand, the damage dealt by each Kindle will depend on how many "Kindle" cards are in the graveyard at the time of casting.

#### **Thought Process for Alice:**
1. **Graveyard State:** At the start of the turn, Alice has two copies of the Kindle in her hand. Since she hasn’t cast any cards yet, there are no "Kindle" cards in the graveyard. Therefore, each Kindle will deal **2 + 0 = 2 damage** to the target.

2. **Targeting Strategy:** Alice wants to maximize the damage she deals to Orim. Since Orim is the primary threat, she should focus her efforts on targeting her. However, she also needs to consider the effects of Orim's abilities.

3. **Casting the Kindle:**
   - If Alice casts one Kindle at Orim, she deals **2 damage** to Orim. Orim’s toughness is 1/3, so she will take 2 damage and enter the Graveyard. Now, the graveyard contains one "Kindle" card.
   - If Alice casts a second Kindle at Orim, she deals another **2 damage** (since the graveyard still contains one "Kindle" card). Orim will now take a total of **4 damage**, which will reduce her toughness to **1/3 - 4 = -11/3**, meaning she will be destroyed.

4. **Optimal Play:** Alice should cast both Kindles at Orim. This will deal a total of **4 damage** to Orim, which will destroy her. However, she must also consider the effects of Orim’s abilities.

### **Bob's Optimal Play**
Bob has the following cards in play:
- **Orim:** A legendary creature with attack and toughness of 1/3. It has the ability, **"Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."**
- **Samate Healer:** A healing card that restores 1 health to a target.

Bob’s goal is to survive the turn and deal damage to Alice. However, he also needs to consider how Orim’s abilities interact with Alice’s cards.

#### **Thought Process for Bob:**
1. **Orim’s Ability:** Orim’s ability prevents the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. This means that if Alice casts a card that would deal damage to Orim, that damage will be blocked.

2. **Alice’s Kindles:** Since each Kindle deals 2 damage, the first two damage instances would be blocked by Orim’s ability. However, the third damage instance (from the second Kindle) would not be blocked because it happens after the first two damage instances.

3. **Strategic Considerations:**
   - If Bob waits until the end of the turn to cast his cards, he can avoid taking damage from the first two Kindles. However, he would still take damage from the second Kindle, which would deal 2 damage to Orim.
   - If Bob casts his cards earlier, he can prevent the damage from the first two Kindles, but he will still take damage from the second Kindle.

4. **Optimal Play:** Bob should cast his cards as early as possible to prevent the damage from the first two Kindles. He should cast the **Orim** first to block the damage, followed by the **Samate Healer** to protect himself from the remaining damage. This way, he can survive the turn and deal damage to Alice in the next turn.

### **Outcome**
1. **Alice’s Actions:**
   - Alice casts both of her Kindles at Orim.
   - The first Kindle deals 2 damage to Orim, which reduces her toughness to **1/3 - 2 = -5/3**. Orim enters the graveyard.
   - The second Kindle deals another 2 damage to Orim, which reduces her toughness to **-5/3 - 2 = -11/3**. Orim is destroyed.

2. **Bob’s Actions:**
   - Bob casts the **Orim** first to block the damage from the first two Kindles.
   - Bob then casts the **Samate Healer** to protect himself from the remaining damage.
   - Since Orim is destroyed, Bob cannot block any more damage.

3. **Final Result:**
   - Alice successfully destroys Orim by dealing 4 damage to her.
   - Bob survives the turn and can continue the game.

### **Key Takeaways**
- Alice’s optimal play is to cast both of her Kindles at Orim, taking full advantage of the damage mechanics and the Graveyard interaction.
- Bob’s optimal play is to cast his cards early to prevent damage from the first two Kindles and protect himself from the remaining damage.
- The interaction between Orim’s ability and the Kindle’s damage mechanics is critical to understanding the outcome of this turn.
