<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer: Who is right? The conversation: Alice asks "What happens to water at -10°C?" Bob says "It freezes." Alice says "No, water freezes at 0°C." Bob says "Yes, but I'm still right."

We need to explain who is right. At -10°C, water would be frozen (ice). So Bob is right that water freezes at -10°C. Alice is correct that water freezes at 0°C under standard pressure, but that doesn't contradict that at -10°C it is also frozen. So both are partially correct. The answer: Both are right: water freezes at 0°C (the freezing point) but at -10°C it is definitely frozen. So Bob's statement "It freezes" is correct; Alice's statement "No, water freezes at 0°C" is also correct but not a refutation. So both are right. Provide brief explanation.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>Both are correct, just talking about different things.

* **Alice** is right that the *freezing point* of pure water at 1 atm is **0 °C**. That’s the temperature where liquid water and ice can coexist in equilibrium.

* **Bob** is right that at **–10 °C** water is **frozen** (it’s well below the freezing point, so any liquid would have turned to ice).

Bob’s answer “It freezes” accurately describes what happens at –10 °C, while Alice’s correction about the freezing point doesn’t contradict that—she’s just stating the specific temperature at which freezing begins. So each statement is true in its own context. [end of text]
