<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer: Who is right? Alice says water freezes at 0°C. Bob says water freezes at -10°C? Actually Bob says "It freezes." Then Alice says "No, water freezes at 0°C." Bob says "Yes, but I'm still right." So Bob's claim: water freezes at -10°C? He said "What happens to water at -10°C?" He answered "It freezes." So he says at -10°C water freezes. Alice says water freezes at 0°C (the normal freezing point). Both statements can be true: water does freeze at -10°C (it is below freezing point, so it will be solid). The freezing point is 0°C under standard pressure, but water can be liquid below 0°C (supercooled) and can be solid above 0°C (pressure). However at -10°C, water will be frozen (assuming normal pressure). So Bob is right that at -10°C water freezes, and Alice is right that the freezing point is 0°C. So both are correct. Provide brief explanation.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>Both are correct.

* **Alice** is right about the *freezing point*: under ordinary atmospheric pressure pure water turns into ice at **0 °C**. That’s the temperature at which liquid water and solid ice coexist in equilibrium.

* **Bob** is right about what happens **at –10 °C**: because –10 °C is well below the freezing point, water will be in the solid (ice) phase (assuming normal pressure and no special tricks like super‑cooling). So “it freezes” is a true description of the state of water at that temperature.

Thus Alice’s statement defines the temperature where freezing begins, while Bob’s statement describes the actual state of water at a lower temperature. Both statements can be true simultaneously. [end of text]
