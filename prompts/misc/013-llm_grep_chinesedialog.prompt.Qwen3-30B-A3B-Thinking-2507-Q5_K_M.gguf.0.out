Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to perform a semantic "grep" on the given input, specifically looking for lines that contain dialog or spoken text. The key here is to only output lines that obviously have spoken text, not tangential mentions.

First, I need to go through each line of the input and check if it contains dialogue. The input is numbered from 1 to 52. Let's go through them one by one.

Line 1: "# 呆總嘅老豆" – This is a title or heading, not dialogue. Ignore.

Line 2: Empty line. Ignore.

Line 3: Empty. Ignore.

Line 4: 「轟隆！」 – This is an onomatopoeic sound, like thunder. It's not spoken text, just a sound effect. So probably not dialogue. Wait, but sometimes in stories, sound effects might be part of the scene, not actual speech. So I think this is not dialogue. Ignore.

Line 5: Empty. Ignore.

Line 6: "平靜嘅夜空，竟然響起乾雷。" – This is narrative, describing the scene. Not dialogue. Ignore.

Line 7: Empty. Ignore.

Line 8: 「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」 – Here, there are two parts in quotes: 「啊～！」 and 「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」 These are clearly spoken lines. So this line contains dialogue. Need to include it.

Line 9: Empty. Ignore.

Line 10: "我望住屋外天色，月光一早被黑雲淹沒，濕氣極重。欽天監今次仲唔掛黑色暴雨警告的話，聽朝睇怕會有十萬人上書皇上，叫佢炒咗嗰班粉腸。" – This is narrative, not dialogue. Ignore.

Line 11: Empty. Ignore.

Line 12: 「轟隆！」 呢次雷聲，果然帶來傾盤大雨，屋外屋頂雨聲不絕。 – Again, 「轟隆！」 is a sound effect, not spoken text. The rest is narrative. So ignore.

Line 13: Empty. Ignore.

Line 14: "我喺呢間屋已經孤獨度過十八個寒暑，屋頂落雨嘅滴嗒聲每一個細節，一早了然於胸。" – Narrative. Ignore.

Line 15: Empty. Ignore.

Lines 16-18: Empty. Ignore.

Line 19: "屋頂 ⋯⋯ 多咗一個人。" – Narrative. Ignore.

Line 20: Empty. Ignore.

Line 21: "我手握劍柄，六神歸一，留心傾聽。果然有人喺屋頂跳落後庭院！輕盈嘅腳步聲極之細微，來者顯然學過輕功。如果唔係忽然落大雨，敵人嘅突襲可能已經得手。" – Narrative. Ignore.

Line 22: Empty. Ignore.

Line 23: "腳步聲越嚟越近，我腰間寶劍出鞘嘅一刻，廳門已經「嘭！」一聲被踢爆。" – Sound effect 「嘭！」 but it's part of the action, not dialogue. Ignore.

Line 24: Empty. Ignore.

Line 25: "好在老夫力拔山河氣蓋世，雖然咁樣斬法我把寶劍肯定見財化水，但刀劍相交嘅時候，我感覺到對方力氣似乎比我大大不如。" – Narrative. Ignore.

Line 26: Empty. Ignore.

Line 27: 「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」 – This is clearly dialogue in quotes. Include this line.

Line 28: Empty. Ignore.

Line 29: 「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。難怪我同佢對打可以力拔山河。平時我邊有咁大力？佢口裡強硬，卻一個翻身跳出牆外，似乎想逃走。 – The part in quotes is dialogue: 「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」. The rest is narrative. So this line contains dialogue. Include it.

Line 30: Empty. Ignore.

Line 31: Empty. Ignore.

Line 32: Empty. Ignore.

Line 33: "我提劍急追，佢見我迫近，回身一劍，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕。" – The 「屌」一聲 is an exclamation, which is spoken. So this line has dialogue. Include it.

Line 34: Empty. Ignore.

Line 35: "此時大雨已經停止，烏雲漸散。月光之下見到黑衣人喺泥地上不斷掙扎，卻已經無力起身再戰。黑衣人嘅臉相有點似曾相識，我再望返佢把劍，大吃一驚。咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天劍？！" – The "咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天劍？！" is a spoken exclamation. So this line contains dialogue. Include it.

Line 36: Empty. Ignore.

Line 37: "呢把劍係當年黨主席賜我嘅禮物，劍身刻有「HARRRR～！！！」嘅洋文，極為霸氣。" – The part in quotes 「HARRRR～！！！」 is part of the description, but it's not dialogue from a character. It's a description of the sword's inscription. So this is not spoken text. Ignore.

Line 38: Empty. Ignore.

Line 39: 「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 – This is dialogue in quotes. Include.

Line 40: Empty. Ignore.

Line 41: 「！！！」 黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我。佢點都估唔到我認得呢把劍。原來係熔癌派人追殺我。 – The 「！！！」 is an exclamation, but it's part of the narrative description. The actual dialogue would be the quotes, but here it's written as part of the action. Wait, the line starts with 「！！！」 which is an exclamation mark, but it's not a spoken line. The actual dialogue here is the previous line. Wait, line 41: 「！！！」 黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神... So the 「！！！」 is probably representing the black person's reaction, but it's not a spoken line. So this line doesn't contain actual dialogue. Ignore.

Line 42: Empty. Ignore.

Line 43: "我望住呢個嚟刺殺我嘅黑衣女人，定睛細看，確定咗我心底嘅疑惑之後，緩慢咁講：" – This is narrative, leading into dialogue. The actual dialogue would be the next line. So this line itself doesn't have spoken text. Ignore.

Line 44: Empty. Ignore.

Line 45: Empty. Ignore.

Line 46: "「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」" – This is dialogue in quotes. Include.

Line 47: Empty. Ignore.

Line 48: "「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔，我忽然醒起熔癌唔識英文。" – The 「？？？」 is an exclamation, part of the narrative. So this line has the quote, which is dialogue. Wait, the line is "「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔..." So the 「？？？」 is the spoken text (the character's confused reaction), so it's dialogue. Include.

Line 49: Empty. Ignore.

Line 50: "「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」" – Dialogue in quotes. Include.

Line 51: Empty. Ignore.

Line 52: "【完】" – This is a closing tag, not dialogue. Ignore.

Now, let's list all the lines that contain dialogue:

Line 4: 「轟隆！」 – Wait, earlier I thought this was a sound effect, not dialogue. But the user's query says "dialog or spoken text". Sound effects like thunder are not spoken text. So line 4 should be excluded.

Wait, line 8: has two quotes, so line 8 is included.

Line 27: 「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」 – included.

Line 29: the quoted part is included.

Line 33: 「屌」一聲 – this is an exclamation, so it's spoken. So line 33 is included.

Line 35: "咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天劍？！" – the "咦！" is spoken, so line 35 is included.

Line 39: 「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 – included.

Line 46: 「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」 – included.

Line 48: 「？？？」 – included.

Line 50: 「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」 – included.

Wait, line 48: the line is "「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔..." So the 「？？？」 is the spoken text (the character's confused sound), so it's dialogue. So line 48 should be included.

Let me double-check each:

Line 8: contains 「啊～！」 and 「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」 → yes.

Line 27: 「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」 → yes.

Line 29: 「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」 → yes.

Line 33: 「屌」一聲 → yes, as it's an exclamation.

Line 35: "咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天劍？！" → yes.

Line 39: 「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 → yes.

Line 46: 「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」 → yes.

Line 48: 「？？？」 → yes.

Line 50: 「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」 → yes.

Wait, line 35: the line is "此時大雨已經停止，烏雲漸散。月光之下見到黑衣人喺泥地上不斷掙扎，卻已經無力起身再戰。黑衣人嘅臉相有點似曾相識，我再望返佢把劍，大吃一驚。咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天劍？！"

So the "咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天劍？！" is part of the narrative but includes the spoken exclamation. So the line contains spoken text. So line 35 should be included.

Similarly, line 33: "我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕." The "屌" is an exclamation, so it's spoken. So line 33 is included.

Now, let's list all the line numbers:

8, 27, 29, 33, 35, 39, 46, 48, 50.

Wait, line 29: the line number is 29. Let's check the input:

Line 29: 「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。...

So line 29 contains the quoted dialogue. So line 29 is included.

Line 33: line 33 is "我提劍急追，佢見我迫近，回身一劍，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕。" So line 33 includes the "屌" exclamation.

Line 35: line 35 is the one with "咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天劍？！"

Line 39: line 39 is "「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」"

Line 46: line 46 is "「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」"

Line 48: line 48 is "「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔，我忽然醒起熔癌唔識英文。"

Line 50: line 50 is "「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」"

Now, check if any others:

Line 4: 「轟隆！」 – not dialogue, just sound.

Line 12: 「轟隆！」 – same as above.

Line 23: 「嘭！」 – sound effect, not dialogue.

Line 37: 「HARRRR～！！！」 – this is part of the sword's inscription, not spoken by a character. So not dialogue.

So the lines to include are 8,27,29,33,35,39,46,48,50.

Wait, line 48: the line is "「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔..." So the 「？？？」 is the spoken text. So line 48 should be included.

Now, let's confirm each line number:

Line 8: yes.

Line 27: yes.

Line 29: yes.

Line 33: yes.

Line 35: yes.

Line 39: yes.

Line 46: yes.

Line 48: yes.

Line 50: yes.

That's 9 lines.

Wait, line 35: the line number is 35. Let's check the input:

35: "此時大雨已經停止，烏雲漸散。月光之下見到黑衣人喺泥地上不斷掙扎，卻已經無力起身再戰。黑衣人嘅臉相有點似曾相識，我再望返佢把劍，大吃一驚。咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天劍？！"

Yes, line 35.

Line 39: line 39 is "「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」"

Line 46: line 46 is "「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」"

Line 48: line 48 is "「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔，我忽然醒起熔癌唔識英文。"

Line 50: line 50 is "「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」"

Okay, so those are the lines.

Now, the user said to output each line with its line number, followed by "---".

So for each matching line, output "line_number: line_content" followed by "---".

Wait, the instruction says: "output the line (together with line number) only if the line has something that matches..."

So for line 8, it's "8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」"

But the user's example in the problem statement shows that the line number is included, so the output should be "8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」"

But wait, the input line 8 is exactly that. So the output should be the line number followed by the line content.

Wait, the input lines are numbered, so line 8 is the line starting with "8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」"

Wait, no. Wait, the input provided is:

# START OF INPUT

1:# 呆總嘅老豆
2:
3:
4:「轟隆！」
5:
6:平靜嘅夜空，竟然響起乾雷。
7:
8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」
...

So line 8 in the input is "8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」"

Wait, no. Wait, the input is given as a numbered list. So each line starts with the line number followed by a colon. So line 8 is "8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」"

But when the user says "output the line (together with line number)", so the output should be the line number followed by the content, but the input already has the line number. Wait, the instruction says "output the line (together with line number)", so for example, if the input line is "8:content", then output "8:content".

But in the problem statement, the input is presented as:

1:# 呆總嘅老豆
2:
3:
...

So each line starts with the number. So when we output, we should output the line as it is, but only the lines that match. So for line 8, the output should be "8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」"

But the user says "output the line (together with line number)", so the line number is part of the line. So we just output the line as it appears in the input, but only for matching lines.

Wait, the input lines are numbered, so line 8 is "8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」"

So when we output, we need to output that exact line, including the "8:".

So the correct output for line 8 is "8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」"

Similarly for others.

Now, let's list all the matching lines:

Line 8: 8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」

Line 27: 27:「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」

Line 29: 29:「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。難怪我同佢對打可以力拔山河。平時我邊有咁大力？佢口裡強硬，卻一個翻身跳出牆外，似乎想逃走。

Line 33: 33:我提劍急追，佢見我迫近，回身一劍，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕。

Line 35: 35:此時大雨已經停止，烏雲漸散。月光之下見到黑衣人喺泥地上不斷掙扎，卻已經無力起身再戰。黑衣人嘅臉相有點似曾相識，我再望返佢把劍，大吃一驚。咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天劍？！

Line 39: 39:「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」

Line 46: 46:「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」

Line 48: 48:「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔，我忽然醒起熔癌唔識英文。

Line 50: 50:「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」

Now, check if these lines actually contain dialogue. For example, line 29: the quoted part is dialogue, so the entire line is included because it contains the dialogue. The instruction says "if the line has something that matches", so even if the line has other text, as long as it contains dialogue, it's included.

Yes, that's correct.

Now, let's make sure none of these are tangential. For example, line 33: "我「屌」一聲" – "屌" is an exclamation, so it's spoken. So it's dialogue.

Line 35: "咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天劍？！" – the "咦！" is spoken, so it's dialogue.

Line 48: 「？？？」 – the question marks represent the character's confused sound, so it's dialogue.

Okay, these all seem to be valid.

Now, output each line with its number, followed by "---".

So the output should be:

8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」

27:「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」
---
29:「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。難怪我同佢對打可以力拔山河。平時我邊有咁大力？佢口裡強硬，卻一個翻身跳出牆外，似乎想逃走。
---
33:我提劍急追，佢見我迫近，回身一劍，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕。
---
35:此時大雨已經停止，烏雲漸散。月光之下見到黑衣人喺泥地上不斷掙扎，卻已經無力起身再戰。黑衣人嘅臉相有點似曾相識，我再望返佢把劍，大吃一驚。咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天劍？！
---
39:「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」
---
46:「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」
---
48:「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔，我忽然醒起熔癌唔識英文。
---
50:「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」
---

Wait, but the user said "Only trigger when the input obviously matches the query, i.e. not tangentially related." So we need to make sure that all these lines are obviously dialogue.

Line 29: the quoted part is dialogue, so yes.

Line 33: "我「屌」一聲" – "屌" is a vulgar exclamation, so it's spoken. So yes.

Line 35: "咦！" is an exclamation, so yes.

Line 48: 「？？？」 is a representation of confusion, so it's dialogue.

All these seem to be valid.

Now, check if any lines were missed.

Line 4: 「轟隆！」 – not dialogue.

Line 12: 「轟隆！」 – same.

Line 23: 「嘭！」 – sound effect.

Line 37: 「HARRRR～！！！」 – inscription, not spoken.

So the list is correct.

Now, output each line as per the instructions.

8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」
