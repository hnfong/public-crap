This is a classic Magic: The Gathering puzzle involving **stack interactions**, **state-based actions**, and **damage prevention**.

Here is the step-by-step breakdown of the optimal play and the final outcome.

### The Setup
*   **Alice's Hand:** 2 copies of *Kindle*.
*   **Bob's Board:** *Orim, Samite Healer* (1/3, untapped).
*   **Bob's Hand:** Empty.
*   **Mana:** Alice has enough mana; Bob's lands are tapped (he cannot cast spells or activate abilities that require mana, though Orim's ability is a tap ability, not a mana ability).
*   **Goal:** Alice wants to kill Orim. Bob wants to keep Orim alive.

### The Mechanics
1.  **Kindle:** "Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards."
    *   *Crucial Rule:* The value of X is determined **as the spell resolves**, not when it is cast.
2.  **Orim, Samite Healer:** "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."
    *   *Crucial Rule:* This is a **prevention effect**. It creates a shield. If damage is dealt to a target with this shield, the damage is prevented (reduced to 0) and the shield is removed.
    *   *Crucial Rule:* This is an **activated ability**. It goes on the stack. It requires the creature to be untapped to activate.

### The Optimal Play Sequence

#### Step 1: Alice's Move
Alice casts the first **Kindle**, targeting **Orim**.
*   **Current State:** 0 Kindles in graveyards.
*   **Stack:** [Kindle #1 targeting Orim]

#### Step 2: Bob's Response
Bob sees the threat. He must decide whether to activate Orim's ability.
*   **Option A (Do nothing):** If Bob does nothing, Kindle #1 resolves. X = 2 + 0 = 2. Orim takes 2 damage. Orim is now a 1/1 with 2 damage marked on it. Alice then casts Kindle #2. X = 2 + 1 (one in graveyard) = 3. Orim takes 3 damage. Total damage = 5. Orim dies.
*   **Option B (Activate Orim):** Bob taps Orim to activate the ability: "Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."
    *   **Stack:** [Orim's Ability] on top of [Kindle #1].

**Bob's Optimal Choice:** Bob **must** activate Orim. If he doesn't, he loses the creature immediately.

#### Step 3: Alice's Response to Bob's Activation
The stack is now:
1.  (Top) Orim's Ability (Prevent next 3 damage)
2.  (Bottom) Kindle #1 (Targeting Orim)

Alice has a choice here. She can let the stack resolve as is, or she can cast her second Kindle.
*   **If Alice does nothing:**
    1.  Orim's ability resolves. Orim is now tapped and has a "shield" preventing the next 3 damage.
    2.  Kindle #1 resolves. X = 2 + 0 = 2.
    3.  The 2 damage is dealt to Orim, but the prevention effect triggers. The damage is prevented. The shield is removed (it prevented 2 of the 3 allowed).
    4.  **Result:** Orim is tapped, has 0 damage marked, and the prevention effect is gone.
    5.  Alice casts Kindle #2. X = 2 + 1 = 3.
    6.  Orim takes 3 damage. Orim dies.

*   **If Alice casts Kindle #2 immediately (while Orim's ability is on the stack):**
    *   Alice casts Kindle #2 targeting Orim.
    *   **Stack:**
        1.  Kindle #2 (Targeting Orim)
        2.  Orim's Ability
        3.  Kindle #1 (Targeting Orim)
    *   **Resolution Order (LIFO - Last In, First Out):**
        1.  **Kindle #2 resolves first.**
            *   How many Kindles are in the graveyard? **0**. (Neither has resolved yet).
            *   X = 2 + 0 = 2.
            *   Damage dealt: 2.
            *   Orim's ability is *not* on the stack yet (it is below this spell), so it has not resolved. **Wait, this is a common misconception.**
            *   *Correction on Stack Logic:* The prevention effect is an **ability** that has already been activated. It is on the stack. When Kindle #2 resolves, the prevention effect is **still on the stack** (it hasn't resolved yet).
            *   **Rule Check:** Prevention effects only work once they have **resolved**. If a spell resolves while a prevention ability is still on the stack (waiting to resolve), the prevention effect does **not** exist yet.
            *   *However*, let's re-evaluate the timing.
            *   Stack: [Kindle #2] -> [Orim Ability] -> [Kindle #1].
            *   **Kindle #2 Resolves:** X = 2 (0 in graveyard). Damage = 2.
                *   Is there a prevention effect active? No. The ability is still on the stack.
                *   Orim takes 2 damage.
            *   **Orim Ability Resolves:** "Prevent the next 3 damage..."
                *   This effect is now active. It looks for the *next* damage event.
                *   The damage from Kindle #2 has already happened. The effect is now waiting for the *next* damage.
            *   **Kindle #1 Resolves:** X = 2 + 1 (Kindle #2 is now in the graveyard) = 3.
                *   Damage = 3.
                *   The prevention effect is active. It prevents the next 3 damage.
                *   The 3 damage is prevented.
            *   **Result:** Orim has 2 damage marked on it. Orim is a 1/3. 2 damage is not lethal. Orim survives.

**Wait, is this the optimal play for Alice?**
Let's re-read the rules on "Prevent the next X damage".
*   **Rule 702.13b:** "If a prevention effect is created... it waits for the next time damage would be dealt to the object... If the damage is prevented, the effect is removed."
*   **Timing:** The prevention effect must be on the stack and **resolve** before the damage event to work.
*   **Scenario A (Alice casts Kindle #2 *after* Orim's ability resolves):**
    *   Orim Ability resolves -> Shield active.
    *   Kindle #1 resolves -> 2 damage prevented. Shield gone.
    *   Kindle #2 resolves -> 3 damage dealt. Orim dies.
    *   *Outcome:* Orim dies.

*   **Scenario B (Alice casts Kindle #2 *before* Orim's ability resolves):**
    *   Stack: [Kindle #2] [Orim Ability] [Kindle #1].
    *   Kindle #2 resolves. X=2. Damage 2 dealt. (No shield yet). Orim has 2 damage.
    *   Orim Ability resolves. Shield active (prevents next 3).
    *   Kindle #1 resolves. X=3 (Kindle #2 is in graveyard). Damage 3 dealt.
    *   Shield prevents the 3 damage.
    *   *Outcome:* Orim has 2 damage. Orim survives.

**Alice's Optimal Play:**
Alice realizes that if she lets Bob's ability resolve first, she loses the "shield" on the first spell, but the second spell will kill Orim.
However, if she **interrupts** Bob's ability by casting the second Kindle *on top* of it, she forces the first Kindle to resolve *after* the shield is active, but the second Kindle (which deals less damage because the graveyard is empty) resolves *before* the shield is active.

Let's re-calculate the damage values carefully.
*   **Kindle #1:** Cast first.
*   **Kindle #2:** Cast second.

**Path 1: Alice lets Bob's ability resolve.**
1.  Alice casts Kindle #1.
2.  Bob activates Orim.
3.  Alice passes priority.
4.  **Orim Ability Resolves:** Shield active (Prevent next 3).
5.  **Kindle #1 Resolves:** X = 2 + 0 = 2. Damage 2. **Prevented.** Shield removed.
6.  Alice casts Kindle #2.
7.  **Kindle #2 Resolves:** X = 2 + 1 = 3. Damage 3. **Dealt.**
8.  **Result:** Orim takes 3 damage. Orim dies.

**Path 2: Alice casts Kindle #2 in response to Orim's ability.**
1.  Alice casts Kindle #1.
2.  Bob activates Orim.
3.  Alice casts Kindle #2 (targeting Orim).
4.  Stack: [Kindle #2] [Orim Ability] [Kindle #1].
5.  **Kindle #2 Resolves:**
    *   Graveyard count: 0.
    *   X = 2.
    *   Damage 2 dealt. (Shield not active yet).
    *   Orim has 2 damage marked.
6.  **Orim Ability Resolves:**
    *   Shield active (Prevent next 3).
7.  **Kindle #1 Resolves:**
    *   Graveyard count: 1 (Kindle #2 is there).
    *   X = 2 + 1 = 3.
    *   Damage 3 dealt.
    *   Shield prevents 3 damage.
    *   Orim takes 0 damage from this spell.
8.  **Result:** Orim has 2 damage marked. Orim is a 1/3. **Orim survives.**

**Conclusion on Alice's Strategy:**
Alice **must not** cast the second Kindle in response to the ability. She must let the ability resolve first.
Why? Because the prevention effect is a "one-time use" shield.
*   If she lets it resolve, the shield eats the first spell (2 damage). The second spell (3 damage) comes through unblocked. **Orim dies.**
*   If she interrupts, the first spell (2 damage) comes through unblocked. The shield eats the second spell (3 damage). **Orim lives.**

Therefore, Alice's optimal play is to **pass priority** after Bob activates Orim, allowing the ability to resolve.

### Final Outcome

1.  **Alice** casts **Kindle #1** targeting Orim.
2.  **Bob** taps Orim to activate the ability: "Prevent the next 3 damage..."
3.  **Alice** sees the stack. She realizes that if she casts Kindle #2 now, the 2 damage from Kindle #2 will hit Orim before the shield activates, and the 3 damage from Kindle #1 will be prevented. Orim survives with 2 damage.
4.  **Alice** chooses **not** to cast Kindle #2 yet. She passes priority.
5.  **Orim's ability resolves.** Orim is now tapped and has a prevention effect active.
6.  **Kindle #1 resolves.**
    *   X = 2 + 0 = 2.
    *   2 damage is dealt to Orim.
    *   The prevention effect prevents this damage.
    *   The prevention effect is removed (it prevented 2 of the 3 allowed).
7.  **Alice** casts **Kindle #2** targeting Orim.
8.  **Kindle #2 resolves.**
    *   X = 2 + 1 (Kindle #1 is in the graveyard) = 3.
    *   3 damage is dealt to Orim.
    *   There is no active prevention effect.
    *   Orim takes 3 damage.
9.  **State-Based Actions:** Orim is a 1/3 creature with 3 damage marked on it.
10. **Result:** **Orim dies.**

### Summary of Thought Process

*   **Bob's Logic:** "I must activate Orim. If I don't, the first Kindle deals 2 damage, and the second deals 3. Total 5. I die. If I activate, I have a shield."
*   **Alice's Logic:** "Bob has a shield that prevents 3 damage.
    *   If I let his shield resolve, it will block my first spell (2 damage). My second spell will deal 3 damage (because the first is in the graveyard). 3 > 1 (Orim's toughness). He dies.
    *   If I cast my second spell *before* his shield resolves, my second spell (2 damage) hits him first. Then his shield resolves. Then my first spell (3 damage) hits him, but the shield blocks it. He survives with 2 damage.
    *   Therefore, I must **wait** for his ability to resolve before casting my second spell."

**Final Answer:**
The optimal play for Alice is to **cast the first Kindle, let Bob activate Orim's ability, let that ability resolve, and then cast the second Kindle.**
The outcome is that **Orim, Samite Healer dies.**

*   **Kindle #1** deals 2 damage, which is prevented by Orim's ability.
*   **Kindle #2** deals 3 damage (2 + 1 card in graveyard), which is not prevented, killing the 1/3 creature. [end of text]
