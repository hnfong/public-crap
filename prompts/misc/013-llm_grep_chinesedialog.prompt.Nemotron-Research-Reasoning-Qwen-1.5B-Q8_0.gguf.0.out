Alright, I need to process this query step by step. The user wants me to perform a semantic "grep" on the given input based on the query they provided. The query is about lines containing dialog or spoken text. So I have to go through each line of the input and check if it has something that matches this condition.

The input starts with line numbers from 1 onwards. The query is "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". So I need to find lines where there's a spoken or dialog content.

Looking at the input:

Line 1: # 呆總嘅老豆 – This seems like a heading, not text.
Line 2: (blank line)
Line 3: (blank)
Line 4:「轟隆！」 – This is a command, likely a speech.
Line 5: "平静嘅夜空，竟然響起乾雷." – This is a sentence, but not a dialogue.
Line 6: "啊～！” – Maybe a question or a comment.
Line 7: "老夫同漢昭烈帝一样係盖世英雄，立即虎口剧震..." – This is a spoken text about a hero.
Line 8: "⋯吓死老夫喇。" – Another spoken text.
Line 9: "我望住屋外天色，月光一早被黑雲淹沒，湿氣极大。欽天監今次仲唔掛黑色暴雨警告的话，听朝睇怕会有十万上书皇上，炒咗嗰班粉腸." – Spoken about a disaster.
Line 10: "我望住屋外天色，月光一早被黑雲淹沒，湿氣极大。欽天監今次仲唔掛黑色暴雨警告的话，听朝睇怕会有十萬人上书皇上，叫佢炒咗嗰班粉腸." – Same as above.
Line 11: "轟隆！” – Spoken command.
Line 12: "屋外屋顶雨声不绝." – Spoken.
Line 13: [image] – Maybe image, not text.
Line 14: "我喺屋已经孤独度过十八个寒暑，屋顶落雨嘅滴嗒声每一個細節，一早了然於胸." – Spoken.
Line 15: "屋顶 ⋯⋯ 多咗一个人." – Spoken.
Line 16: [image]
Line 17: "![image]" – Image again.
Line 18: "屋顶 ⋯⋯ 多咗一个人." – Spoken.
Line 19: "我手握劍柄，六神歸一，留心傾听。果然有人喺屋顶跳落後庭院！轻盈脚步声极微，来者显然学过轻功。如果唔係突然落大雨，敌人突袭可能已经得手." – Spoken.
Line 20: "21: 我手握劍柄，六神归一，留心傾听。果然有人喺屋顶跳落後庭院！轻盈脚步声极微，来者显然学过轻功。如果唔係突然落大雨，敌人突袭可能已经得手." – Same as above.
Line 21: "我手握劍柄，六神归一，
