We are given a query: "relating to dangerous activities that may get somebody hurt"
 We must scan each line of the input (with line numbers) and output the line (with line number) only if the line obviously relates to dangerous activities that may get somebody hurt.

 Important: Only trigger when the input obviously matches the query, not tangentially related.

 Let's go through the input line by line and check for any line that clearly describes dangerous activities that may cause harm.

 We note that the input is a list of bookmarks and comments, with line numbers.

 We'll look for lines that mention:
   - activities that are inherently dangerous (like stunts, extreme sports, etc.)
   - activities that could lead to injury (like cooking with fire, using tools, etc.)
   - but note: we must be cautious because some lines might be tangential.

 However, the instruction says: "Only trigger when the input obviously matches the query, i.e. not tangentially related."

 Let's check the lines:

 We'll go through the lines and see if any line clearly describes a dangerous activity.

 Line 1: "# Other bookmarks" -> not dangerous.
 Line 2: (empty) -> skip.
 Line 3: "## Interesting blogs" -> not dangerous.
 Line 4: (empty) -> skip.
 Line 5: "- https://danluu.com/" -> a blog, not obviously dangerous.
 Line 6: "- https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/ - Shtetl-Optimized" -> blog, not dangerous.
 ... (we can skip most of the blogs and links that are about general topics)

 We are looking for lines that explicitly or obviously describe dangerous activities.

 Let's scan for keywords: dangerous, hurt, injury, harm, risky, etc.

 However, note: the query says "relating to dangerous activities that may get somebody hurt", so we are looking for activities that are dangerous and may cause harm.

 We'll check each line:

 Line 29: "- http://www.dogbunnypuzzle.com/" -> a puzzle game? Not obviously dangerous.
 Line 30: "- https://github.com/mgerdes/Open-Golf - Nice and simple game!" -> a game, not dangerous.
 Line 31: "- http://magickeyboard.io/ FUN (might be worth making Space_Invaders thing from this!)" -> a fun thing, but not dangerous.
 Line 32: "- https://eightcolors.net/ - Nice HTML puzzle game" -> puzzle game, not dangerous.
 Line 33: "- https://0xf00ff00f.github.io/zettawatt/ - Moliu click click get more resource game" -> game, not dangerous.
 Line 34: "- https://www.pounce.sh/ - Stealth and hunting game" -> a game, not dangerous (though "hunting" might be a word, but it's a game).
 Line 35: "- https://orb.farm/ - Fish bowl" -> not dangerous.

 Line 74: "- ☆ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lApoqj68FQw (SNES Super Mario World complete walkthrough)" -> a walkthrough of a game, not dangerous.
 Line 75: "- ☆ https://github.com/d07RiV/diabloweb (Diablo 1 in webasm)" -> a game, not dangerous.
 Line 76: "- https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7qFBOhneFnTAZmv35MTlWKC3YBmR7T7L  - Starcraft II 廣東話教學" -> a tutorial for a game, not dangerous.

 Line 89: "## Finance and Business" -> not dangerous.

 Line 90: "- ☆ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16qy12WDxcY Fed Chair Powell Speaks to David Rubenstein (full interview)" -> interview, not dangerous.
 ... (most of the finance lines are not dangerous)

 Line 136: "## Prediction Markets" -> not dangerous.

 Line 141: "## Misc History" -> not dangerous.

 Line 174: "## Pre-history" -> not dangerous.

 Line 192: "## Arcane" -> not dangerous.

 Line 193: "## Sciences" -> not dangerous.

 Line 286: "## Lifestyles, Lifehacks" -> this section might have something dangerous? Let's check.

 Line 288: "- ☆ https://lovelygreens.com/complete-guide-natural-soap-additives/" -> soap making, which might involve chemicals, but is it dangerous? Not obviously. Soap making can be done safely, and the description doesn't say it's dangerous.
 Line 289: "- http://www.trueactivist.com/gab_gallery/how-to-turn-a-beer-can-into-the-only-camping-stove-youll-ever-need/ - Page not found - True Activist" -> This is about making a camping stove from a beer can. Making a stove from a beer can can be dangerous because it involves fire and metal that can get very hot. This might be a candidate.

 Let's read the description: "how-to-turn-a-beer-can-into-the-only-camping-stove-youll-ever-need". The process of making a stove from a beer can involves cutting the can and creating a fire chamber. This can be dangerous because:
   - Cutting the can might cause cuts.
   - The stove gets very hot and can cause burns.
   - If not done properly, it might cause a fire.

 So this line is about a dangerous activity (making a camping stove from a beer can) that may get somebody hurt.

 Therefore, line 289 should be included.

 Line 290: "- https://www.facebook.com/chaplinwu/posts/10203730425715623 - baby wrap" -> baby wrap, which is for carrying babies. Not dangerous (unless misused, but the description doesn't say it's dangerous).
 Line 291: "- http://time.com/12086/how-to-make-your-kids-smarter-10-steps-backed-by-science/ - How To Make Your Kids Smarter: 10 Steps Backed By Science | TIME" -> not dangerous.
 Line 292: "- https://www.fancyhands.com - Fancy Hands is a team of US-based virtual assistants ready to start working with you today" -> not dangerous.
 Line 293: "- http://www.glass-universe.com/2016/07/satoshi-tomizu-how-to-buy.html -- Nice looking glass art" -> glass art, which might involve cutting glass (which can be dangerous) but the description doesn't say it's dangerous. It's just about buying glass art. So not obviously dangerous.
 Line 294: "- https://kknews.cc/zh-hk/news/knyogb.html - Cheaper Chinese Cleavers" -> cleavers (knives) are tools that can be dangerous if mishandled, but the line is just about buying cleavers. It doesn't describe a dangerous activity. So not obviously matching.

 Line 295: "- http://www.onestopfoodsupply.com - HK imported groceries" -> groceries, not dangerous.
 Line 296: "- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVDDLEF0vTU - Mozzarella with Milk Powder" -> cooking, which can be dangerous (hot oil, etc.) but the description doesn't say it's dangerous. It's a recipe. So not obviously matching.

 Line 297: "- https://www.facebook.com/twlazyworker/videos/2290698921042490/ rope a jar" -> rope a jar? This might be a typo for "rope a jar" meaning tying a jar? But it's unclear. However, the description says "rope a jar", which might be a dangerous activity? But it's not clear. We'll skip because it's not obviously dangerous.

 Line 298: "- http://robdunnlab.com/projects/wildsourdough/ - Wild Sourdough – Public Science Lab" -> making sourdough, which is a baking activity. Not dangerous.

 Line 299: "- https://www.facebook.com/myschoolbus.com.hk/videos/938079079618755/ - Magnetic Plastic Pieces" -> toys, not dangerous.

 Line 300: "- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G72936Y3xA Top 10 Knots To Know" -> knots. Knots are generally safe, but the video is about learning knots. However, knots are used in climbing and sailing which can be dangerous, but the description doesn't say that. It's just a list of knots. So not obviously dangerous.

 Line 301: "- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lLPAHK_k6I 10 knots you NEED to know in life. [Save this Video]" -> same as above, not obviously dangerous.

 Line 302: "- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLORsLlcT48 DOPAMINE DETOX: Take Back CONTROL Of Your Life & STOP LAZINESS! | Dr. Andrew Huberman" -> a detox, not dangerous.

 Line 303: "- https://github.com/openfarmcc/OpenFarm - OpenFarm is a free and open database and web application for farming and gardening knowledge." -> gardening, which can be dangerous (using tools, etc.) but the description doesn't say it's dangerous. So not obviously matching.

 Now, let's check the Health and Food section (lines 306-341):

 Line 308: "- https://paleoleap.com/long-fasts/ - Long Fasts: Dangerous or Beneficial? | Paleo Leap" -> This line explicitly says "Long Fasts: Dangerous or Beneficial?" and the title suggests that fasting can be dangerous. So this is about a dangerous activity (long fasting) that may get somebody hurt.

 Therefore, line 308 should be included.

 Line 309: "- http://personalexcellence.co/blog/fasting/ - My Fasting Experiment - Personal Excellence" -> fasting, but the title doesn't say it's dangerous. However, the previous line (308) is about the danger of fasting, so this might be related. But the line itself doesn't say "dangerous", so we have to be cautious. The instruction says: "Only trigger when the input obviously matches the query". The line 309 doesn't explicitly say it's dangerous, so we might skip it. However, note that the query is about "relating to dangerous activities", and fasting is the activity. But the line doesn't say it's dangerous. So we'll skip it because it's not obvious.

 But wait: the query is "relating to dangerous activities that may get somebody hurt". The activity (fasting) is dangerous, but the line doesn't say it's dangerous. However, the line is about fasting, and we know from line 308 that fasting can be dangerous. But the instruction says: "Only trigger when the input obviously matches the query". The line 309 doesn't explicitly state that it's dangerous, so we won't include it.

 Line 310: "- http://www.toptenreviews.com/business/services/best-virtual-assistants/ - Business Software Reviews | Top Ten Reviews" -> not dangerous.

 Line 311: "- https://intensivedietarymanagement.com/refeeding-syndromes-fasting-20/" -> refeeding syndrome is a dangerous condition that can occur after fasting. The title mentions "refeeding syndromes", which is a dangerous medical condition. So this line is about a dangerous condition that can happen after fasting. But note: the query is about "dangerous activities", and the activity here is fasting (which leads to refeeding syndrome). However, the line itself is about the syndrome, not the activity. But the activity (fasting) is the cause. The line is titled "refeeding syndromes fasting", so it's related to the dangerous activity of fasting. However, the line doesn't explicitly say "dangerous activity", but it's about a dangerous consequence of an activity. The query says "relating to dangerous activities", so this might be included.

 But let's be cautious: the query is about the activity itself being dangerous. The line 311 is about the syndrome that can occur from the activity. So it's related. However, the instruction says "obviously matches". We have to decide: is this obviously about a dangerous activity? The activity (fasting) is the dangerous activity, and the line is about a dangerous consequence of that activity. So it's related.

 However, note that line 308 already covers the dangerous aspect of fasting. We are to output the line if it has something that matches the query. The line 311 is about a dangerous condition (refeeding syndrome) that is a result of a dangerous activity (fasting). So it is relating to the dangerous activity (via its consequence). But the query says "relating to dangerous activities", so it should be included.

 But wait: the query says "dangerous activities that may get somebody hurt". The activity (fasting) is dangerous and may get somebody hurt (by causing refeeding syndrome). So the line 311 is about a dangerous consequence of a dangerous activity, which is related. However, the instruction says "obviously matches". We have to be careful not to include tangential lines.

 Let's compare with line 308: that line explicitly says "Long Fasts: Dangerous or Beneficial?" so it's obviously about the danger of the activity.

 Line 311: "refeeding-syndromes-fasting-20" - the title is "refeeding syndromes fasting", which is a bit cryptic. But the content is about refeeding syndrome in the context of fasting. So it's clearly related to the dangerous activity of fasting.

 However, note: the query is about the activity being dangerous, not the consequence. But the line is about the consequence, which is a direct result of the activity. So it's related.

 But the instruction says: "Only trigger when the input obviously matches the query". We have two lines that are about fasting and danger: 308 and 311.

 We'll include both.

 However, let's check the rest of the health section:

 Line 312: "- https://intensivedietarymanagement.com/practical-fasting-tips-part-12/" -> fasting tips, but doesn't say dangerous. So skip.
 Line 313: "- https://intensivedietarymanagement.com/atkins-decline-hormonal-obesity-part-xx
