Okay, let's see. Alice says water freezes at -10°C, but Bob says it freezes at 0°C. Then Bob says he's still right even though Alice corrected him. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think.

First, I know that water freezes at 0°C under standard conditions. So Alice is correct in stating that. Bob initially said it freezes at -10°C, which is wrong. Then Alice corrects him, and Bob says he's still right. That seems contradictory.

Maybe Bob is referring to something else. Like, maybe he's talking about supercooled water or something. Supercooled water can stay liquid below 0°C, but that's not typical. Or perhaps he's considering different pressures or impurities. But the question doesn't mention those factors.

The user is asking who is right. Based on standard conditions, Alice is correct. Bob's initial answer was wrong, and even after correction, he insists he's right, which is confusing. Unless there's a trick here.

Wait, maybe Bob is right in a different context. For example, if the water is in a container that's at -10°C, but that's not the same as the freezing point. The freezing point is the temperature at which water turns to ice, which is 0°C. So unless there's a specific scenario, Alice is correct.

I should explain that water freezes at 0°C under normal conditions, so Alice is right. Bob's initial answer was incorrect, and his insistence afterward doesn't change that. Maybe he's confused or misunderstanding the question.

Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0°C under standard atmospheric conditions. Bob's initial statement that it freezes at -10°C is incorrect, and his claim to still be right afterward is unfounded. [end of text]
