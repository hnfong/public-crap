A) Yes, water freezes at -12 degrees Celsius. This is because the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius, which is equivalent to -12 degrees Celsius on the Fahrenheit scale. 

B) If a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will freeze and turn into ice. The water molecules slow down and form a crystalline structure, which is characteristic of ice. 

Here's a brief explanation: Water molecules are in constant motion at room temperature. However, when the temperature drops to -12 degrees Celsius, the water molecules slow down and start to form a hexagonal lattice structure. This process is called crystallization, and it is what turns liquid water into ice. 

In summary, water freezes at -12 degrees Celsius, and if a glass of pure water is cooled down to this temperature, it will turn into ice.
