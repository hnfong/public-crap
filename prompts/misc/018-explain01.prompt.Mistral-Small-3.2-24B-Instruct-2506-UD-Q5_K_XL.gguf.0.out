Aight, listen up, I'm gonna break it down for ya,

The Fed, they run the money game, ya feel me?

They control the cash flow, like a DJ with the beat,

Makin' sure the economy don't skip a seat.

They set the interest rate, like a bouncer at the door,

Too high, nobody gets in, too low, it's a free-for-all, no more.

They print them dollars, like a rapper spittin' fire,

But they gotta keep it tight, so the economy don't tire.

They buy and sell them bonds, like a hustler on the street,

Makin' sure the banks got cash, so they can't admit defeat.

They watch the markets, like a hawk in the sky,

Makin' sure nobody's cheatin', keepin' the game alive.

They fight inflation, like a boxer in the ring,

Keepin' prices low, so the people don't sing the blues.

They create jobs, like a CEO in a suit,

Makin' sure the economy's hummin', keepin' the people loose.

So that's the Fed, they run the money game,

Keepin' the economy right, like a DJ with the same.

They do what they can, to keep the cash flowin',

So the people can live, and the economy's growin'. [end of text]
