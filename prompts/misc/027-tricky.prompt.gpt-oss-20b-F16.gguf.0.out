<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer two questions: A) Does water freeze at -12°C? B) If you have a glass of pure water cooled to -12°C, what happens? Provide brief explanations.

We need to consider supercooling, nucleation, freezing point of pure water is 0°C at 1 atm. At -12°C, water can remain liquid if supercooled, but eventually nucleation occurs. In a glass, impurities or surfaces can nucleate ice. So at -12°C, water may remain liquid until nucleation occurs, then freeze rapidly. So answer: water does not spontaneously freeze at -12°C unless nucleation occurs; it can remain supercooled. In a glass, if pure water, it may stay liquid until a disturbance triggers freezing, then it will freeze into ice, possibly forming a clear ice. Also mention that water can freeze at lower temperatures if supercooled, but typical freezing point is 0°C. So answer accordingly.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**A)**  
No. Pure water freezes at **0 °C** (32 °F) under normal atmospheric pressure. At –12 °C it can remain liquid if it is *super‑cooled*—that is, if no ice nuclei are present to start the crystallization process. Only when a nucleation event occurs will it freeze.

**B)**  
If you have a glass of *pure* water and you cool it to –12 °C, the water will stay liquid as long as it remains super‑cooled. In practice, the glass surface, dissolved gases, or any tiny impurity will usually provide a nucleation site, so the water will suddenly crystallize into ice. The ice that forms is typically clear and may have a slightly different density (ice is less dense than liquid water), so the ice will float. If the water is exceptionally pure and the glass is very clean, it might stay liquid for a while until a disturbance (tapping, a dust particle, etc.) triggers freezing. [end of text]
