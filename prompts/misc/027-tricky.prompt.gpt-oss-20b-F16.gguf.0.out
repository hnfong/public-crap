<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer two questions: A) Does water freeze at -12°C? B) If you have a glass of pure water, what happens if cooled to -12°C? Provide brief explanations.

We need to consider supercooling: pure water can remain liquid below 0°C if no nucleation sites. At -12°C, water can remain liquid if supercooled. But eventually freeze spontaneously or with nucleation. So answer: water can remain liquid below freezing point if supercooled. At -12°C, water may remain liquid if pure and undisturbed, but will freeze spontaneously or when disturbed. So B: In a glass of pure water cooled to -12°C, it may remain liquid (supercooled) until nucleation occurs, then freeze rapidly. So explanation: water's freezing point is 0°C under normal conditions, but can be supercooled to lower temperatures. At -12°C, water may still be liquid if supercooled; if nucleation occurs, it will freeze. So answer accordingly.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**A)**  
No, under normal conditions water freezes at **0 °C** (32 °F).  
However, pure water can be *super‑cooled*—kept liquid below its normal freezing point—if it has no impurities or disturbances that act as nucleation sites. In that case it can stay liquid well below 0 °C, even down to about –12 °C or lower, until something triggers crystallization.

**B)**  
If you have a glass of *pure* water and you cool it to –12 °C, the water will most likely remain liquid (super‑cooled) as long as it stays undisturbed and free of nucleation sites. If the water is disturbed, a small impurity appears, or a seed crystal is introduced, it will suddenly freeze, often explosively, because the temperature is far below the normal freezing point. Thus, at –12 °C the water can be liquid until a nucleation event occurs, after which it will freeze. [end of text]
