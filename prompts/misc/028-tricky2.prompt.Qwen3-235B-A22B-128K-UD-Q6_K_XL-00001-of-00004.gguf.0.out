Alice is correct in stating that **water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius** under standard atmospheric pressure. That is the scientifically accepted freezing point of water.

Bob is incorrect in saying that water freezes at -10°C, because that is below the normal freezing point. However, he might be referring to the fact that **once water is already frozen**, it can remain solid at -10°C — but that doesn't mean water *freezes* at that temperature by default.

So, **Alice is right** about the freezing point, and **Bob is wrong** if he claims water freezes at -10°C. If Bob meant that frozen water *stays frozen* at -10°C, that part is true, but doesn't make his original statement correct. [end of text]
