If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

When a theory proves itself, it means that the theory is able to derive its own statements as true. This is a key aspect of self-referential systems, and it can lead to different logical outcomes depending on the context and the specific rules of inference.

### Consistency
A theory is considered consistent if it does not contain any contradictions. In other words, it is impossible to derive both a statement and its negation from the theory. If a theory proves itself, it does not necessarily mean it is inconsistent; it could still be consistent if it does not derive contradictions.

### Tautological
A tautology is a statement that is always true, regardless of the truth values of its components. In the context of a theory, a tautology would be a statement that is provable within the theory and is true by definition. For example, the statement "P or not P" (the law of excluded middle) is a tautology in classical logic.

### Examples of Self-Referential Theories
1. **Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems**: Gödel's incompleteness theorems show that in any sufficiently powerful, consistent formal system, there are statements that cannot be proven or disproven within the system. However, the proofs of these theorems themselves are self-referential and can be seen as a form of self-referential theory. Gödel's first incompleteness theorem, for instance, shows that within a certain formal system, there are true statements that cannot be proven within that system.

2. **Self-Referential Paradoxes**: These are paradoxes that arise from self-referential statements. For example, the Liar Paradox: "This statement is false." If the statement is true, then it must be false, and if it is false, then it must be true. This creates a paradox.

3. **Self-Referential Axioms**: In some axiomatic systems, axioms can be designed to be self-referential. For example, in some non-standard models of arithmetic, there can be axioms that assert their own consistency or truth.

### Conclusion
If a theory proves itself, it does not necessarily mean it is consistent or tautological. It depends on the specific content and structure of the theory. For a theory to be consistent, it must not derive contradictions. For a theory to be tautological, it must be provable and always true within the system. Self-referential theories can be consistent or inconsistent, and they can also be tautological or not, depending on the specific statements and rules of inference involved. [end of text]
