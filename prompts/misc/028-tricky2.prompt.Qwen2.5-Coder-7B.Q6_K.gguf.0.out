Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, not -10 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is a well-known fact in physics and chemistry, and it is universally accepted that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. Therefore, Alice's statement is accurate, and Bob's statement is incorrect.
