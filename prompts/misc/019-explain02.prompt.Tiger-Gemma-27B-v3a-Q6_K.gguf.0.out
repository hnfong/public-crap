Okay, imagine you have a big class at school, right? And sometimes, the teacher needs to make a big decision for the whole class, like what game to play at playtime. 

In China, instead of a teacher, they have something called the National People's Congress. It's like a REALLY big group of grown-ups, even bigger than your whole school! They all get together to make the rules for the whole country. 

Think of it like this: if your mum and dad make rules for your house, like "no jumping on the sofa," the National People's Congress makes rules for *all* of China, like "everyone needs to go to school" or "we need to build more parks."

They don't ask everyone in China what they think, though.  They mostly listen to the people in charge, like the head teacher listens to the headmaster.  

So, it's a big group that makes the rules, but it's different from how things work here in London, where lots of people get to vote and choose who makes the rules!
