### Conflicting Events Analysis

Here are the events from the list above that have scheduling conflicts (overlapping times for the same implied resource or attendee):

1.  **Quantum Computing Summit** vs. **Local Bake Sale** vs. **Crypto Currency Rally**
    *   **Date:** 2023-05-12
    *   **Conflict:** The Summit runs 09:00–17:00. The Bake Sale runs 10:00–14:00 (fully inside the Summit). The Crypto Rally runs 13:00–16:00 (overlaps with both).
    *   **Why:** All three occur simultaneously on the same day.

2.  **Global AI Expo** vs. **Annual Tech Gala** vs. **Web3 Developer Con**
    *   **Date:** 2024-11-04
    *   **Conflict:** The Global AI Expo is a multi-day event (Nov 3–5), so it is active all day on Nov 4. The Web3 Con runs 09:00–12:00, and the Tech Gala runs 19:00–23:30.
    *   **Why:** Both the Web3 Con and the Tech Gala happen while the Global AI Expo is still in session.

3.  **Robotics Competition** vs. **Data Science Bootcamp** vs. **Satellite Launch Viewing**
    *   **Date:** 2023-09-23 and 2023-09-24
    *   **Conflict:**
        *   On **Sep 23**: Robotics (08:00–17:00) overlaps entirely with Data Science Bootcamp (09:00–16:00).
        *   On **Sep 24**: Robotics (08:00–17:00) overlaps with Satellite Launch Viewing (06:00–08:00) at the 08:00 mark (assuming inclusive start/end times) or creates a tight turnaround conflict, and overlaps with the tail end of the Data Science Bootcamp (which ends Sep 25).
    *   **Why:** Significant time overlap on the 23rd; partial overlap on the 24th.

4.  **Cybersecurity Workshop** vs. **Cloud Migration Seminar**
    *   **Date:** 2025-02-14
    *   **Conflict:** Cybersecurity runs 13:00–16:00. Cloud Migration runs 14:30–17:30.
    *   **Why:** They overlap between 14:30 and 16:00.

5.  **Startup Pitch Night** vs. **Blockchain Conference**
    *   **Date:** 2024-07-19
    *   **Conflict:** Startup Pitch runs 18:00–21:00. Blockchain Conference runs 17:30–22:00.
    *   **Why:** They overlap between 18:00 and 21:00.

6.  **IoT Developer Meetup** vs. **FinTech Innovation Day**
    *   **Date:** 2025-06-08
    *   **Conflict:** IoT Meetup runs 11:00–13:00. FinTech runs 12:30–15:30.
    *   **Why:** They overlap between 12:30 and 13:00.

7.  **Green Energy Forum** vs. **Space Exploration Panel** vs. **Drone Racing Finals**
    *   **Date:** 2023-12-01 and 2023-12-02
    *   **Conflict:**
        *   On **Dec 1**: Green Energy (09:00–17:00 next day) overlaps with Space Panel (14:00–16:00).
        *   On **Dec 2**: Green Energy (still active until 17:00) overlaps with Drone Racing (10:00–15:00).
    *   **Why:** The multi-day Green Energy Forum conflicts with single-day events on both days of its duration.

8.  **VR Gaming Tournament** vs. **5G Implementation Talk**
    *   **Date:** 2026-01-10
    *   **Conflict:** VR Tournament runs 10:00–20:00. 5G Talk runs 15:00–18:00.
    *   **Why:** The 5G Talk occurs entirely within the VR Tournament window.

9.  **UX Design Hackathon** vs. **Agile Methodology Training** vs. **Digital Marketing Masterclass**
    *   **Date:** 2024-03-16
    *   **Conflict:** UX Hackathon is multi-day (Mar 15–17), so it is active all day on the 16th. Agile Training runs 09:00–17:00. Digital Marketing runs 13:00–16:00.
    *   **Why:** Both the Agile Training and Digital Marketing Masterclass happen while the UX Hackathon is ongoing. Additionally, Digital Marketing overlaps with Agile Training.

10. **Smart City Symposium** vs. **BioTech Breakthroughs** vs. **Machine Learning Ops**
    *   **Date:** 2025-10-06
    *   **Conflict:** Smart City Symposium is multi-day (Oct 5–7), active all day on the 6th. BioTech runs 09:00–18:00. ML Ops runs 14:00–17:00.
    *   **Why:** Both BioTech and ML Ops occur during the Smart City Symposium. ML Ops also overlaps with BioTech.

11. **Neural Network Lecture** vs. **Edge Computing Workshop**
    *   **Date:** 2026-08-22
    *   **Conflict:** Neural Network runs 10:00–12:00. Edge Computing runs 11:30–14:30.
    *   **Why:** They overlap between 11:30 and 12:00.

12. **Autonomous Vehicle Demo** vs. **Augmented Reality Fair**
