Bob is correct in a way, but Alice is also correct in a different context. Here's the explanation:

- **Alice** is correct in saying that **water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius** under standard atmospheric pressure. This is the typical freezing point of water.

- **Bob** is also correct because **water can freeze at -10 degrees Celsius** under **different conditions**, such as when it is under pressure or in a supercooled state. However, this is not the standard or common freezing point.

So, **Alice is right under normal conditions**, while **Bob is right in specific, non-standard conditions**. [end of text]
