**The situation**

- **Alice** has two copies of **Kindle** in hand.  
  - *Kindle* is an instant: “Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards.”  
- **Bob** controls **Orim, Samite Healer** (1/3, legendary) which is already on the battlefield and is not summoning‑sick.  
  - Orim’s ability: “Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.”  
- Bob has no cards in hand and his lands are tapped out (so he cannot pay any costs that require mana).  
- It is Alice’s turn, she has enough mana to cast both Kindles, and she wants to kill Orim.

The question asks for the **optimal play for both players** and the **outcome**, with reference to MTG rules (as of 2024).

## 1. Understanding Kindle’s damage‑setting mechanic

When Kindle is cast, you choose a target *any target* (player, creature, planeswalker, etc.) and then you determine the value **X**:

> X = 2 + (the number of cards named **Kindle** in **all graveyards**).

The phrase “in all graveyards” means *every* graveyard in the game (both players’). The count is taken at the moment the spell resolves, after any other effects that might have changed the number of Kindles in graveyards (e.g., if a Kindle was cast earlier in the turn and is now in a graveyard).

Because Kindle is an instant, it can be cast at any time Alice has priority, and its damage resolves immediately.

---

## 2. What does Orim’s ability do?

Orim’s tap ability is a **activated ability** that can be activated any time Alice has priority (including on her own turn) as long as Orim is not already tapped. The ability creates a prevention effect:

> “Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.”

Key points:

- It **does not** prevent damage that is already on the stack; it only prevents damage that *would be dealt* after the ability resolves.
- The prevention is **global** – it can be applied to any target of damage, not just Orim herself.
- The prevention lasts **until end of turn** (or until the 3 damage is prevented, whichever comes first). After the turn ends, the effect disappears.
- The ability can be activated only once per turn (once Orim is tapped, she cannot be tapped again until she untaps during her next untap step).

Because Bob’s lands are tapped out, he cannot pay any additional costs, but the tap ability costs only {T}, which he can pay because Orim is already on the battlefield and he has priority.

---

## 3. Alice’s possible lines

Alice wants to kill Orim (deal at least 3 damage to a 1/3 creature). She has two Kindles. She can cast them in any order, but the damage each one deals depends on how many Kindles are already in graveyards when it resolves.

### Option A: Cast the first Kindle, then the second

1. **First Kindle** – At the moment it resolves, there are **0** Kindles in any graveyard (none have been cast yet).  
   - X = 2 + 0 = **2**.  
   - Alice chooses a target (presumably Orim). The spell deals 2 damage to Orim.  
   - After resolution, the first Kindle is put into Bob’s graveyard (the spell resolves, deals damage, then is put into the graveyard as usual).  

2. **Second Kindle** – Now there is **1** Kindle in a graveyard (the one just cast).  
   - X = 2 + 1 = **3**.  
   - If Alice targets Orim again, it deals 3 damage. Orim has 1 toughness, so 3 damage > 1 toughness → Orim is destroyed.

**Result:** Orim dies. The total damage dealt is 2 + 3 = 5, which is more than enough.

### Option B: Cast the second Kindle first (i.e., cast them in reverse order)

The order doesn’t matter for the final outcome because the first Kindle you cast will always see 0 Kindles in graveyards, and the second will see 1. The damage values are the same: 2 then 3.

### Option C: Try to “double‑strike” or otherwise increase damage

There is no other card or effect that can modify the damage of Kindle, so the only way to get more than 3 damage from a single Kindle is to have more Kindles already in graveyards before you cast it. With only two Kindles in hand, the maximum X you can achieve is 2 + 1 = 3 (for the second Kindle). So the maximum total damage you can deal in one turn with two Kindles is 2 + 3 = 5.

---

## 4. Bob’s possible responses

Bob has no cards in hand, but he does have Orim’s tap ability. He can activate it at any time after Alice announces a Kindle but **before** it resolves, because the ability creates a prevention effect that will apply to the *next* damage that would be dealt.

### Bob’s optimal response

If Bob lets the first Kindle resolve, Orim will take 2 damage (which is not lethal because Orim has 1 toughness, but damage is not “lethal” until it equals or exceeds toughness; 2 damage is already lethal to a 1/3). Actually, 2 damage to a 1/3 is lethal (1 + 2 = 3 > 1). Wait—let’s be precise: a 1/3 has toughness 3. Damage is marked on it; when damage >= toughness, the creature is destroyed. So 2 damage is *not* lethal to a 1/3 (it would need 3). Right, I need to correct that: Orim is a 1/3, so she has **toughness 3**. She can survive 2 damage; she dies only when she receives **3 or more** damage.

Thus:

- First Kindle deals 2 damage → Orim has 2 damage marked (not lethal).
- Second Kindle deals 3 damage → total damage = 5, which is >= 3 → Orim is destroyed.

Now, can Bob prevent any of that damage?

He can activate Orim’s ability **once** to prevent the *next* 3 damage. He could do it in response to the first Kindle, or in response to the second. Let’s examine both:

#### Response to the first Kindle

- **Bob activates Orim’s tap ability** in response to the first Kindle.  
  - The ability resolves, creating a prevention effect: “Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.”  
- Then the first Kindle resolves. Its damage (2) would be prevented because the prevention effect is active.  
  - The 2 damage is prevented, Orim takes 0 damage.  
  - The prevention effect then has 1 “point” left (it prevented 2 of the 3 damage it could have prevented).  
- Now the first Kindle is in the graveyard.  
- Alice casts the second Kindle. When it resolves, there is 1 Kindle in a graveyard, so X = 3.  
  - The second Kindle would deal 3 damage. The remaining 1 point of the prevention effect will prevent 1 damage, leaving 2 damage to be dealt.  
  - Orim receives 2 damage (not lethal).  
- After the turn ends, the prevention effect expires. Orim survives with 2 damage marked.

**Result:** Orim lives. Alice dealt a total of 2 (prevented) + 2 (actual) = 4 damage, but only 2 actually stuck. Orim is at 2 damage, not dead.

#### Response to the second Kindle

- If Bob does **not** respond to the first Kindle, the first Kindle resolves normally (2 damage, not lethal).  
- Then Alice casts the second Kindle. In response, Bob can activate Orim’s ability.  
  - The prevention effect will prevent the *next* 3 damage.  
  - The second Kindle would deal 3 damage. The prevention effect prevents all 3, so Orim takes 0 damage.  
- After the turn, Orim is at 2 damage (from the first Kindle) but is not dead (damage is not lethal).  
- The prevention effect is used up.

**Result:** Orim lives, with 2 damage marked.

#### No response at all

If Bob does not activate the ability at all, the first Kindle deals 2, the second deals 3, total 5, Orim dies.

## 5. Determining the optimal play for each player

### Alice’s optimal play

Alice wants to kill Orim. She should cast both Kindles **as quickly as possible**, not giving Bob a chance to use the prevention ability. However, because the ability can be used in response to any spell, she cannot *force* Bob to not respond. But she can try to **minimize the window** for Bob to act.

The optimal sequence for Alice is:

1. **Cast the first Kindle**, targeting Orim.  
2. **Immediately cast the second Kindle** (if she has priority after the first resolves).  

But note: after the first Kindle resolves, priority passes to Bob before Alice can cast another spell (unless she has a way to retain priority, which she doesn’t). So the sequence is:

- Alice casts Kindle #1 → goes on stack.  
- Bob can respond (tap Orim) or let it resolve.  
- If Bob does nothing, Kindle #1 resolves, dealing 2 damage, goes to graveyard.  
- Then Alice gets priority again and can cast Kindle #2.  
- Bob can again respond (tap Orim) or let it resolve.  

Thus Alice cannot “force” both Kindles to resolve without Bob having a chance to respond to at least one of them. However, she can **maximize the chance that Bob’s response is ineffective** by making the second Kindle deal **3** damage, which is the maximum the prevention can handle (3). If Bob uses the ability on the first Kindle (2 damage), the second will still deal 2 (as we calculated). If he uses it on the second (3 damage), the first still deals 2. In either case, Orim will survive with 2 damage.

Wait—actually, let’s re-evaluate: If Bob uses the ability on the first Kindle (preventing 2 of the 2 damage), the remaining 1 point of prevention can be used on the second Kindle, reducing its damage from 3 to 2. So Orim lives with 2 damage. If Bob uses the ability on the second Kindle (preventing all 3), Orim lives with 2 damage from the first. So in either case, Orim lives.

Thus, **Alice cannot kill Orim if Bob has the ability to activate it**. She can only kill Orim if Bob **fails to activate** the ability (or if he cannot, e.g., if Orim is already tapped). Since Bob has the ability available and his lands are tapped, but he can still tap Orim (no mana cost), he can always respond.

Therefore, the optimal play for Alice is to cast both Kindles, but she should recognize that Bob will likely prevent the lethal blow. However, there is a subtle point: **Bob can only prevent the “next” 3 damage**. If Alice casts the first Kindle, and Bob does **not** respond, then the first deals 2. Then Alice casts the second. If Bob then responds with the prevention, the second deals 0 (all 3 prevented). Orim lives with 2 damage. If Bob responds to the first, the second deals 2. Orim lives with 2 damage. So in either case, Orim lives.

But wait—could Alice do something else? She could try to **cast the Kindles in such a way that the prevention effect is “wasted”**? For example, if she casts the first Kindle for 2, and Bob prevents it, the prevention effect has 1 point left. Then the second deals 3, but only 1 is prevented, so 2 sticks. Orim lives. If she tries to cast them **simultaneously** (e.g., with a card that allows splitting them, but she doesn’t have one), she can’t.

Thus, with two Kindles, Alice cannot kill Orim if Bob uses the ability optimally.

But is there any way Alice can force Bob to not be able to respond? The only way would be if the spell could not be responded to, but all instants can be responded to. So no.

Therefore, the **optimal outcome** is that Orim survives, with 2 damage marked, because Bob will use the prevention ability on whichever Kindle would be lethal (the second one, dealing 3). But actually, if he uses it on the first, the second deals 2, still not lethal. So he can choose either; either way Orim lives.

Wait—let’s be precise: If Bob uses the ability on the first Kindle (preventing 2), the second deals 3, but 1 is prevented, so 2 sticks. If he uses it on the second (preventing 3), the first deals 2. So in both cases, Orim takes 2 damage and lives. So the outcome is the same: Orim lives with 2 damage.

But is there any scenario where Alice can kill Orim? Only if Bob **does not** use the ability. But that would be suboptimal for Bob. So the optimal play for Bob is to use the ability, and the optimal play for Alice is to cast both Kindles (since that at least deals damage and forces Bob to use the ability). Alice cannot force a kill.

Thus, the optimal outcome is: **Orim survives with 2 damage, and Bob’s prevention ability is used (and exhausted) for the turn.**

But wait—could Alice cast the first Kindle, and if Bob does not respond, then she knows he might be holding the ability for the second? But she has to cast the second anyway. She could try to **bluff** by casting a different spell, but she has only Kindles. So she must cast them.

One more nuance: The prevention effect is “the next 3 damage that would be dealt to **any target** this turn.” It doesn’t have to be dealt to Orim. So if Alice were to cast a different spell that deals damage to Bob (the player) after the Kindles, that damage could also be prevented. But she has no other spells.

So, in summary:

- **Alice’s optimal play:** Cast both Kindles, one after the other, targeting Orim. She cannot avoid giving Bob a chance to respond.
- **Bob’s optimal play:** In response to the **second** Kindle (the one that would deal 3 damage), activate Orim’s tap ability to prevent the next 3 damage. This will prevent all 3 damage from the second Kindle (and also any subsequent damage, but there is none). Orim will have taken 2 damage from the first Kindle and will survive.

Alternatively, he could respond to the first, but it doesn’t matter; either way Orim lives with 2 damage. The optimal choice is to respond to the second, because it uses the full 3 prevention and guarantees Orim lives with exactly 2 damage (if he responds to the first, the second deals 2, still 2 damage, but it doesn’t matter). Actually, both are equivalent in terms of final result (Orim lives with 2 damage). But responding to the second is more “obvious” because it prevents the lethal.

Thus, the outcome is: Orim survives with 2 damage marked, and Bob’s prevention ability is used up.

## 6. Final answer

**Optimal play:**

1. **Alice** casts the first Kindle, targeting Orim.  
2. **Bob** chooses not to respond (or could respond, but it doesn’t matter for the final outcome). The first Kindle resolves, dealing 2 damage to Orim. The first Kindle is put into a graveyard.  
3. **Alice** casts the second Kindle, targeting Orim.  
4. **Bob** activates Orim’s tap ability in response, creating a prevention effect that will prevent the next 3 damage.  
5. The second Kindle resolves. It would deal 3 damage, but the prevention effect prevents all 3.  
6. Orim ends the turn with 2 damage marked (from the first Kindle) and survives. The prevention effect expires at end of turn.

**Result:** Orim lives with 2 damage. Alice has used both Kindles, dealing a total of 5 damage (2 + 3), but only 2 sticks because of the prevention. Bob’s Orim is still on the battlefield.

**Thought process:**  
- Alice wants to kill Orim, but with only two Kindles the maximum damage she can deal in one turn is 5. However, Bob’s Orim has a prevention ability that can block up to 3 damage. Because the ability can be used in response to any Kindle, Bob can always prevent the lethal damage (the 3 from the second Kindle). The best Alice can do is force Bob to use the ability, but she cannot prevent him from doing so.  
- Bob’s optimal response is to use the ability on the second Kindle (or the first, but the result is the same) to ensure Orim survives with 2 damage. This uses up the prevention for the turn, but Orim is still alive.

Thus, the optimal outcome is that Orim survives.

---

**Final note:** If Bob had not used the ability, Orim would have died. But using the ability is strictly better for Bob, so it is the optimal choice. Therefore, the game-theoretic optimal play leads to Orim surviving. [end of text]
