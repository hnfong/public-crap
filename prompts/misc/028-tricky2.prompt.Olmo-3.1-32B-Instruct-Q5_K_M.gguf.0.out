Let's break down the statements:

- **Alice says:** "Water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
  - This is **correct** in the context of pure water under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm). At 0°C, pure water begins to freeze.

- **Bob says:** "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
  - This is **not strictly correct** for pure water at standard pressure. At -10°C, water is already well below its freezing point and is solid (ice), but the *freezing point* itself is at 0°C.

However, Bob then says: "Yes, but I'm still right."
- This could be interpreted as Bob trying to argue that at -10°C, water *is* frozen, which is true, but the *freezing point* (the temperature at which water changes from liquid to solid) is still 0°C.

**So, who is right?**

- **Alice is correct** about the freezing point of water: it is 0°C.
- **Bob is technically correct** that at -10°C, water is frozen, but he is **incorrect** if he claims that water *freezes* at -10°C (meaning that's the temperature at which it turns to ice).

**Summary:**  
Alice is right about the freezing point. Bob is right that water is frozen at -10°C, but wrong about the freezing point temperature. So, **Alice is more correct in the scientific sense**. [end of text]
