<s> <用户>If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

<AI> There are a few theories and frameworks that have been considered to be "tautally consistent, including:
1. The theory of mathematics itself: The theory of mathematics is a field of mathematics, in which every statement is proved true and every false, and every false.

 The theory of the laws of logic: The laws of logic that every statement is, such as "p=p∧p∨¬p" and ∧, "p∧¬p∧¬" is true, "∨ and "p"p∧", is false is false
 and every
 of the axiom: the theory of Zerminal axioms of a, which states that all sets are ordered sequences of is sets, which, with a
 the axiom of the axioms of finitary: that all is a of every and every a is a, is a, and.
 of countable countable.
 of countable, the theory that countable sets is, in the sets of which every a countable is a of countable set is set
 the of a
