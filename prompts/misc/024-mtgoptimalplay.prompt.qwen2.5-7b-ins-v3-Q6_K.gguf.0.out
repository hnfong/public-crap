<Thought>
Alright, I need to analyze this Magic the Gathering scenario between Alice and Bob. Let's break down the situation step by step to determine the optimal plays for both players.

**Current State:**
- **Alice's Hand:** Two copies of 'Kindle'.
- **Alice's Graveyard:** None mentioned, but 'Kindle' is an instant that affects the graveyard, so it's possible there are other cards there.
- **Bob's Hand:** None.
- **Bob's Board:** Orim, Samite Healer, which is a 1/3 legendary creature with the ability: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."
- **Mana:** Alice has sufficient mana to cast any spells. Bob's lands are tapped out, meaning he can't play any more creatures or activate abilities that require tapping lands.

**Objective:**
- **Alice's Goal:** Kill Orim.
- **Bob's Goal:** Prevent Alice from killing Orim.

**Understanding 'Kindle':**
- 'Kindle' is an instant spell that deals damage to any target. The damage amount is calculated as X = 2 + the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards.
- If Alice has two 'Kindle' cards in her hand, and assuming there are no other 'Kindle' cards in the graveyard, X = 2 + 0 = 2. So, each 'Kindle' would deal 2 damage to any target.

**Analyzing the Situation:**
1. **Alice's Options:**
   - **Play a 'Kindle' and target Orim:** This would deal 2 damage to Orim.
   - **Play both 'Kindle' cards and target Orim:** This would deal a total of 4 damage to Orim.
   - **Play a 'Kindle' and target another creature or player:** This would deal 2 damage elsewhere, but since Orim is a threat, targeting it seems more strategic.

2. **Bob's Options:**
   - **Tap Orim to use its ability:** Preventing the next 3 damage to any target this turn. If Alice plays a 'Kindle' targeting Orim, Bob can tap Orim to prevent the damage.
   - **Do nothing:** Accept the damage, but since Bob's lands are tapped out, he can't play any additional cards or activate abilities that could mitigate the damage.

**Potential Scenarios:**
1. **Alice Plays One 'Kindle' Targeting Orim:**
   - **Outcome:** Orim takes 2 damage.
   - **Bob's Response:** Tap Orim to prevent the next 3 damage. Since the damage has already been dealt, tapping Orim doesn't prevent anything in this instance.
   - **Result:** Orim remains unaffected, and Alice's 'Kindle' has no lasting effect.

2. **Alice Plays Both 'Kindle' Cards Targeting Orim:**
   - **Outcome:** Orim takes 4 damage.
   - **Bob's Response:** Tap Orim to prevent the next 3 damage. The 4 damage has already been dealt, so tapping Orim doesn't prevent any damage.
   - **Result:** Orim is destroyed, and Alice successfully kills Orim.

3. **Alice Targets Another Target with 'Kindle':**
   - **Outcome:** Damage dealt to another creature or player.
   - **Bob's Response:** Tap Orim to prevent the next 3 damage to any target. If the damage is dealt to a different target, it doesn't affect Orim.
   - **Result:** Orim remains safe, and Alice deals damage elsewhere.

**Optimal Play for Alice:**
- **Play both 'Kindle' cards targeting Orim.**
  - **Reasoning:** This ensures that Orim takes 4 damage, which is more than its toughness (1/3). Since Bob can only prevent 3 damage per tap, tapping Orim won't save it from destruction. Additionally, targeting Orim directly addresses the threat to Alice's burn deck.

**Optimal Play for Bob:**
- **Tap Orim to prevent the next 3 damage to any target.**
  - **Reasoning:** While tapping Orim doesn't prevent the damage Alice is about to deal, it's a strategic move to prevent potential future damage or to protect other targets. However, in this scenario, since Alice is targeting Orim specifically and has sufficient damage to destroy it, tapping Orim doesn't change the immediate outcome.

**Conclusion:**
Alice's optimal play is to cast both 'Kindle' cards targeting Orim, dealing a total of 4 damage, which will destroy Orim. Bob's best response is to tap Orim to prevent any future damage, but since the damage has already been dealt, it doesn't alter the immediate outcome. Therefore, Alice successfully eliminates the threat posed by Orim.
