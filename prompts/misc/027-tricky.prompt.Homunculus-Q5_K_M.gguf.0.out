A) **Yes**, water freezes at **0 degrees Celsius** under standard atmospheric pressure. At **-12 degrees Celsius**, water is **below its freezing point**, so it will **not freeze** unless it is already in a solid state or under special conditions (like high pressure or supercooling).

B) **If you have a glass of pure water and cool it down to -12 degrees Celsius**, the water will **not freeze**. Instead, it will **remain in liquid form** until it reaches **0 degrees Celsius**, at which point it will begin to freeze. If the water is already at -12Â°C and you add ice or lower the temperature further, it may **supercool** (remain liquid below freezing point) or **freeze** depending on conditions like pressure and impurities.
