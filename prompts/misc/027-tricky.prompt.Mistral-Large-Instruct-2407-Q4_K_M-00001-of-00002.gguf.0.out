[INST] Answer the following questions with brief explanations.

A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?
B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?
[/INST] 1. **A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?**

   Yes, water freezes at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure, but once it freezes, it can remain solid at temperatures below this point, including -12 degrees Celsius.

2. **B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?**

   If a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will freeze and become ice. However, it's important to note that the freezing process typically begins at 0 degrees Celsius. As the water cools further, it will continue to solidify and remain frozen at -12 degrees Celsius. If the cooling process is very rapid, the water might become supercooled and remain liquid below its freezing point for a short time, but it will eventually freeze. [end of text]
