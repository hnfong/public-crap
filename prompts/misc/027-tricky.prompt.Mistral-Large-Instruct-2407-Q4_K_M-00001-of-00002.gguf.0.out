 A) Yes, water freezes at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure, but it can freeze at lower temperatures if it is supercooled or if the pressure is changed. At -12 degrees Celsius, water will definitely be in its solid state (ice).

B) If you have a glass of pure water and it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, the water will freeze and turn into ice. However, it's important to note that water can sometimes be supercooled, meaning it remains in a liquid state below its freezing point if it's very pure and undisturbed. But any disturbance or impurity will cause it to quickly crystallize and turn into ice at this temperature. Additionally, the glass itself may crack or break due to the expansion of water as it freezes. [end of text]
