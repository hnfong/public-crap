 A) Yes, water freezes at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure, but it can freeze at lower temperatures if it is already in a liquid state and cooled slowly (a process known as supercooling).

B) If you have a glass of pure water and it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will likely freeze. However, if the water is very pure and cooled carefully, it might enter a supercooled state, remaining liquid below its standard freezing point. Any disturbance or impurity can cause it to suddenly crystallize and turn into ice. [end of text]
