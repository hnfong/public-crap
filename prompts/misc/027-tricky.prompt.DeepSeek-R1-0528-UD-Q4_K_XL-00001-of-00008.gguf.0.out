Okay, the user is asking two related questions about water freezing at -12°C. Let me break this down carefully.

First question is straightforward - does water freeze at -12°C? Well, I know pure water freezes at 0°C under standard pressure. So -12°C is way below that freezing point. The answer should be no, but I should explain why people might think otherwise. Maybe they've seen lakes freeze in winter when air temp is below zero, but that's different from pure water in controlled conditions.

Second question is trickier. User has pure water and cools it to -12°C. Ah, this is where supercooling comes in! Pure water can sometimes stay liquid below freezing if it's very still and clean. But the moment it gets disturbed, it'll freeze instantly. That's such a cool phenomenon - literally and figuratively. I should mention that while it's possible, it's unstable.

Hmm, the user seems curious about basic physics. Maybe they're a student? Or just someone observing winter phenomena? I'll keep explanations simple but accurate. No need for complex jargon - just clear science. 

I recall supercooled water demonstrations where you tap the bottle and it freezes before your eyes. That visual might help them understand, but since they asked for brief, I'll stick to essentials. 

Key points to emphasize: pure vs impure water, nucleation concept, and the unstable nature of supercooled state. Should clarify that while liquid can exist at -12°C, it's not the normal behavior.

Here are concise answers with explanations:

**A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?**
*   **No.** Pure water at standard atmospheric pressure freezes at **0°C**. -12°C is significantly below this temperature.

**B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?**
*   **It *might* remain liquid (supercooled) or freeze solid, depending on conditions.**
    *   **Supercooling:** Very pure, still water in a smooth container can sometimes cool below 0°C without freezing. At -12°C, it could remain liquid but is highly unstable (supercooled).
    *   **Freezing:** Any disturbance (shaking, adding a speck of dust, tapping the glass) or an impurity acting as a nucleation site will cause the supercooled water to **freeze almost instantly** into ice.

**Explanation:** While 0°C is the equilibrium freezing point, pure water needs a starting point (nucleation site) to begin forming ice crystals. Without this, it can supercool. However, -12°C is deep into the supercooling range, making spontaneous freezing likely, and any disturbance will definitely trigger it. [end of text]
