The probable output of the given Linux command is a list of the 20 most frequent words from the `wowfanfic.txt` file, sorted in descending order of frequency.

Here's a breakdown of the command and its components:

1. `cat wowfanfic.txt`: This command reads the contents of the `wowfanfic.txt` file and outputs it to the standard output (stdout).

2. `perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'`: This command uses Perl to process the input from the previous step. Here's what it does:

   - `perl -ne`: This tells Perl to read the input line by line (`-n`) and execute the code block (`-e`) for each line.
   - `@a = split(/\s/);`: This splits each line into an array of words using whitespace (`\s`) as the delimiter.
   - `foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }`: This prints each word from the array, followed by a newline.

3. `| sort`: This command sorts the output from the previous step in ascending order.

4. `uniq -c`: This command counts the occurrences of each word in the sorted output and outputs the word and its count.

5. `sort -n`: This command sorts the output from the previous step in ascending order of word frequency.

6. `tail -n 20`: This command outputs the last 20 lines of the sorted output.

In terms of linguistic principles, this command is an example of natural language processing (NLP) and text analysis. It's a simple yet effective way to analyze the frequency of words in a text file, which can be useful for tasks such as text summarization, keyword extraction, and sentiment analysis.

The use of Perl in this command is an example of a scripting language being used for text processing, which is a common practice in NLP and text analysis. The command also demonstrates the use of various Unix tools, such as `cat`, `perl`, `sort`, `uniq`, and `tail`, to process and analyze text data. [end of text]
