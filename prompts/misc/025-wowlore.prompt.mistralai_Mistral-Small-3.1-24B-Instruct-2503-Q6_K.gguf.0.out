Sure! Here are places in World of Warcraft lore from the original vanilla game, one for each letter of the alphabet:

A - **Azeroth**: The world in which the game primarily takes place.

B - **Booty Bay**: A bustling pirate-themed port city in Stranglethorn Vale.

H - **Hillsbrad Foothills**: A region in the Eastern Kingdoms, known for its rolling hills and human settlements.

I - **Ironforge**: The capital city of the dwarves and gnomes in the Eastern Kingdoms.

J - **Jade Forest**: This is a bit of a trick, as the Jade Forest is actually from the Mists of Pandaria expansion. So, let's go with **Jadefire Run** in the Blasted Lands.

P - **Plaguelands**: A region in the Eastern Kingdoms, divided into Eastern and Western Plaguelands, heavily affected by the Scourge.

Q - **Queldanas**: This is a bit tricky as there isn't a well-known place starting with Q in vanilla WoW. So, let's go with **Quel'Thalas**, the ancient capital of the high elves.

R - **Razorfen Downs**: A dungeon in the Barrens, home to various dangerous creatures.

S - **Stormwind**: The capital city of the Alliance in the Eastern Kingdoms.

T - **Tanaris**: A desert region in Kalimdor, known for its sand dunes and the city of Gadgetzan.

W - **Westfall**: A region in the Eastern Kingdoms, known for its human settlements and the Defias Brotherhood.

X - **Xavian**: This is a bit tricky as there isn't a well-known place starting with X in vanilla WoW. So, let's go with **Xavian**, a reference to the Xavian region in the Eastern Kingdoms, though it's not a major location.
