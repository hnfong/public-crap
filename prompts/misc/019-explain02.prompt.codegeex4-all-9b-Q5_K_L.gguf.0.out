The National People's Congress (NPC) is like a big group of people who help make decisions for China. It's like a big team of helpers who work together to make sure China is a good place to live. They talk about important things like how to make schools better, how to take care of the environment, and how to help people who need help. They listen to what people have to say and then make decisions together. It's a very important job, and it helps to make China a better place for everyone.
