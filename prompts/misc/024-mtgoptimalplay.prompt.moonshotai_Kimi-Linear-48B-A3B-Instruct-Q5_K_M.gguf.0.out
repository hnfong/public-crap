We need to analyze a Magic: The Gathering scenario. Alice has two copies of 'Kindle' in hand. Bob has Orim, Samite Healer in play, untapped. Bob has no cards in hand, lands tapped out. It's Alice's turn. Alice wants to kill Orim. Bob wants to survive.

We need to consider the optimal play for both players. The question: "what is the optimal play for both players in this situation?" So we need to consider what Alice should do, and what Bob should do (if any). The scenario: Alice has two copies of Kindle in hand. Bob has Orim, Samite Healer in play, untapped. Bob has no cards in hand, lands tapped out. It's Alice's turn. Orim has been on board for a while (unaffected by summoning sickness). Alice has sufficient mana to cast any spells. Bob's lands are tapped out.

We need to think about the game state: It's Alice's turn. She can cast spells. She has two copies of Kindle in hand. She wants to kill Orim. Orim is a 1/3 creature with a tap ability: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So Orim can prevent up to 3 damage to any target each turn. It can be tapped to prevent damage to itself or any other target. It can be tapped multiple times? The ability is a tap ability, so it can be activated once per turn, but can be untapped later. However, it's a legendary creature, so it's unique. It can be tapped to prevent damage. So if Alice wants to kill Orim, she needs to deal at least 3 damage to it. But Orim can prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. So if Alice deals 3 damage to Orim, Orim can prevent it. But if Alice deals more than 3 damage, Orim can only prevent 3 of it, leaving the rest to kill it. However, Orim can also be tapped to prevent damage to itself, but also can be tapped to prevent damage to any target. So if Alice deals 3 damage to Orim, Orim can prevent it, but if Alice deals 4 damage, Orim can only prevent 3, leaving 1 damage to kill it. However, Orim can also be tapped to prevent damage to any target, including itself. So if Alice deals 3 damage to Orim, Orim can prevent it, but if Alice deals 4 damage, Orim can prevent 3, leaving 1 damage to kill it. However, Orim can also be tapped to prevent damage to any target, including itself. So if Alice deals 3 damage to Orim, Orim can prevent it, but if Alice deals 4 damage, Orim can prevent 3, leaving 1 damage to kill it. However, Orim can also be tapped to prevent damage to any target, including itself. So if Alice deals 3 damage to Orim, Orim can prevent it, but if Alice deals 4 damage, Orim can prevent 3, leaving 1 damage to kill it. However, Orim can also be tapped to prevent damage to any target, including itself. So if Alice deals 3 damage to Orim, Orim can prevent it, but if Alice deals 4 damage, Orim can prevent 3, leaving 1 damage to kill it. However, Orim can also be tapped to prevent damage to any target, including itself. So if Alice deals 3 damage to Orim, Orim can prevent it, but if Alice deals 4 damage, Orim can prevent 3, leaving 1 damage to kill it. However, Orim can also be tapped to prevent damage to any target, including itself. So if Alice deals 3 damage to Orim, Orim can prevent it, but if Alice deals 4 damage, Orim can prevent 3, leaving 1 damage to kill it.

So if Alice deals 3 damage to Orim, Orim can prevent it, but if Alice deals 4 damage, Orim can prevent 3, leaving 1 damage to kill it.
