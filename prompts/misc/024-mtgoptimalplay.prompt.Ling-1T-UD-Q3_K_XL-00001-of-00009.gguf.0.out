We are given a **Magic: the Gathering** scenario involving:

- **Alice**: Has two **Kindle** cards in hand.  
  - *Kindle* is an **instant** that says:  
    > "Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards."

- **Bob**: Has **Orim, Samite Healer** in play, **untapped**.  
  - Orim is a 1/3 legendary creature with the ability:  
    > "{T}: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."

- It is **Alice's turn**.
- Bob’s lands are tapped out → Bob cannot cast spells or activate abilities that require mana.
- Orim is **not** affected by summoning sickness → Bob can tap it for its ability.
- Alice has sufficient mana to cast spells.
- Goal: Alice wants to kill Orim.

Let’s analyze step by step.

---

### Step 1: Understand Kindle’s damage calculation

> X = 2 + (number of **Kindle cards in all graveyards**)

Currently, **no Kindles have been cast yet**, so:
- Graveyards contain **zero** Kindle cards.
- So if Alice casts **one** Kindle, X = 2 + 0 = **2 damage**.

But if she **casts both**, the **first** Kindle will go to the graveyard, so the **second** Kindle will see **one** Kindle in the graveyard → X = 2 + 1 = **3 damage**.

So:
- Cast first Kindle → 2 damage
- Cast second Kindle → 3 damage (because the first is now in the graveyard)

Total potential: 5 damage, but possibly mitigated by Orim.

---

### Step 2: Orim’s ability

- Bob can **tap** Orim to **prevent the next 3 damage** that would be dealt to **any target** this turn.
- The ability is **activated**, costs {T}, and can be used **any time** Bob has priority.
- Since it’s Alice’s turn, Bob gets priority **after** each spell she casts.

So Bob can respond to Alice’s Kindle casts by activating Orim’s ability.

---

### Step 3: Alice’s goal

She wants to deal **enough damage to kill Orim** (toughness 3). So she needs to get **3 damage through** to Orim.

But Orim can **prevent 3 damage** per activation.

So if Alice casts one Kindle → 2 damage → Bob can prevent all of it → 0 damage → Orim survives.

If Alice casts two Kindles:
- First: 2 damage → Bob can prevent 3 → prevents all 2 → 0
- Second: 3 damage → Bob can **prevent the next 3**, so prevents all 3 → 0

So both spells get fully prevented → Orim survives.

But wait — is there a way to **overwhelm** the prevention?

Yes — if Alice can deal **more than 3 damage in a single spell**, then even after prevention, some gets through.

But:
- First Kindle: 2 damage → fully preventable
- Second Kindle: 3 damage → fully preventable (since 3 ≤ 3)

So both are fully preventable.

But here’s a **key insight**:

> Orim’s ability prevents **"the next 3 damage"** — it’s a **shield**, not a permanent effect. Once 3 damage has been prevented, the ability is used up.

So if Alice can **force Bob to use the prevention on a small spell**, then the bigger spell might get through.

But Bob is smart — he will **save** the prevention for the bigger threat.

Let’s simulate the turn.

### Alice’s Turn: Optimal Play

Alice wants to maximize damage to Orim.

She has two options:

#### Option A: Cast one Kindle targeting Orim
- Deals 2 damage
- Bob can activate Orim → prevent next 3 damage → prevents all 2
- Result: 0 damage

Then Alice casts second Kindle:
- Now X = 2 + 1 (first Kindle in graveyard) = 3 damage
- Bob can activate Orim again? → **No!** Orim’s ability is **one-shot per activation**, and it hasn’t been used yet this turn? Wait — did Bob use it?

Wait: Bob **can** activate Orim’s ability **multiple times per turn**, as long as he can tap it each time.

But Orim is **untapped** at the start of the scenario.

So Bob can tap it **once** to prevent 3 damage → then it’s tapped.

But if Alice casts the first Kindle → Bob taps Orim to prevent 2 damage → Orim is now **tapped**.

Then Alice casts second Kindle → 3 damage → Bob **cannot** tap Orim again (it’s tapped) → so **no prevention** → 3 damage → Orim dies!

Ah! This is the key.

So if Alice casts **both Kindles**, and Bob uses the prevention on the **first**, then the **second** gets through for 3 damage → lethal.

But Bob is smart — he might **wait** to use the prevention.

Can Bob wait?

Yes.

When Alice casts the **first** Kindle (2 damage), Bob can **let it resolve**, knowing that if he uses the prevention now, then the second (bigger) spell gets through.

But if he **doesn’t** prevent the first, then:
- First Kindle: 2 damage → Orim takes 2 → now at 1 toughness
- Then Alice casts second Kindle → 3 damage → Bob can now **prevent 3**, so prevents all 3 → Orim survives with 1 toughness

So Bob’s optimal play:
- Let the **first** Kindle resolve → Orim takes 2 damage (now 1 toughness)
- Then, when Alice casts the **second** Kindle (3 damage), Bob activates Orim’s ability → prevents 3 damage → 0 damage → Orim survives

Result: Orim at 1 toughness.

But is there a better way for Alice?

What if Alice casts **both Kindles in a different order**? Doesn’t matter — the second one is always bigger.

But what if she casts them **targeting different things**? Not useful — she wants to kill Orim.

Wait — could she **cast the second Kindle first**? No, because the first one cast is the first one that goes to the graveyard.

She has to cast them sequentially.

So sequence:
1. Cast Kindle → 2 damage
2. Bob decides: use prevention or not?
   - If he uses it → Orim survives, tapped → then second Kindle (3 damage) → no prevention → lethal
   - If he doesn’t use it → Orim takes 2 → then second Kindle → Bob prevents 3 → Orim survives

So Bob will **not** use the prevention on the first spell.

Thus:
- First Kindle resolves → 2 damage to Orim → Orim at 1 toughness
- Second Kindle → 3 damage → Bob activates Orim → prevents 3 → 0 damage
- Orim survives

But wait — can Bob activate Orim **in response** to the second Kindle?

Yes.

Sequence:
- Alice casts second Kindle (targeting Orim) → goes on stack
- Bob gets priority → taps Orim → "prevent next 3 damage" shield is activated
- Kindle resolves → deals 3 damage → prevention shield absorbs all 3 → 0 damage

So Orim survives.

Therefore, **Bob can fully protect Orim** by saving the prevention for the second, bigger spell.
