A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. Pure water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. At temperatures below 0Â°C, water typically begins to freeze, but the exact temperature at which freezing starts can vary slightly depending on factors like impurities, pressure, and the presence of nucleation sites.

B) If a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will begin to freeze. At this temperature, the water molecules lose enough thermal energy to form ice crystals. However, the freezing process may not be immediate or complete due to the temperature being below the freezing point, and the glass may not be perfectly insulated. Over time, the water will gradually turn into ice as it continues to lose heat. [end of text]
