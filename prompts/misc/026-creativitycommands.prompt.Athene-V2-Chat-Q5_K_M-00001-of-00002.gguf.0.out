The command you've provided is a pipeline of several operations that process the text from your `wowfanfic.txt` file. Let's break down each part of the command and then discuss the probable output:

1. **`cat wowfanfic.txt`**: This command reads the contents of `wowfanfic.txt` and outputs it to the standard output (stdout).

2. **`| perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'`**: This part of the pipeline takes the output from `cat` and processes it using a Perl one-liner:
   - `split(/\s/)` splits the input into an array `@a` based on whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines).
   - The `foreach` loop iterates over each element in the array and prints it followed by a newline. This effectively tokenizes the text into individual words, each on a new line.

3. **`| sort`**: This sorts the words alphabetically.

4. **`| uniq -c`**: This counts the occurrences of each unique word. The `-c` option adds a count before each unique word.

5. **`| sort -n`**: This sorts the output numerically based on the count, so the words with the lowest frequency appear first.

6. **`| tail -n 20`**: This selects the last 20 lines of the sorted output, which will be the 20 most frequently occurring words in the text.

### Probable Output

Given the nature of the command and basic linguistic principles, the output will likely show the 20 most frequently occurring words in your fan fiction. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Common Function Words**: In any natural language text, function words (also known as closed-class words) such as articles (a, an, the), prepositions (in, on, of), conjunctions (and, but, or), and pronouns (he, she, it, they) tend to be the most frequent. These words are essential for the grammatical structure of sentences but carry little semantic content.

2. **Content Words**: Content words (also known as open-class words) such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are more specific to the context and theme of the text. In a World of Warcraft fan fiction, you might see content words related to the game's universe, such as character names (e.g., Arthas, Jaina), locations (e.g., Stormwind, Orgrimmar), and specific terms (e.g., mana, quest).

3. **Frequency Distribution**: The frequency distribution of words in a text typically follows Zipf's law, which states that the frequency of any word is inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency table. This means the most common word will appear many times, the second most common word will appear fewer times, and so on.

### Example Output

Here is a hypothetical example of what the output might look like:

```
  123 the
   98 and
   85 of
   76 to
   68 a
   65 in
   54 that
   52 is
   48 it
   45 with
   42 for
   40 on
   38 he
   36 she
   35 was
   34 they
   32 but
   30 or
   28 Arthas
   27 Stormwind
```

### Explanation

- **Function Words**: Words like "the," "and," "of," "to," "a," "in," "that," "is," "it," "with," "for," "on," "he," "she," "was," "they," "but," and "or" are common function words and are likely to be among the most frequent.
- **Content Words**: Words like "Arthas" and "Stormwind" are specific to the World of Warcraft context and are likely to appear frequently if they are central to your fan fiction.

This output reflects the typical distribution of words in a natural language text, with a mix of very common function words and more specific content words that are relevant to the theme of your fan fiction. [end of text]
