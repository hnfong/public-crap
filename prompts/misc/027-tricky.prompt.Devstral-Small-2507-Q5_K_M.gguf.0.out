A) Water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) at standard atmospheric pressure. However, water can remain liquid below this temperature in a supercooled state, but it is not a stable condition.

B) If a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will likely freeze. When water is cooled below its freezing point, it typically forms ice crystals and solidifies. However, if the water is pure and cooled very slowly, it can remain in a supercooled liquid state until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze. [end of text]
