Snow White 🌸  
✨✨✨  

Once upon a time, in a land of 🌲🌳🌳 and 🌈🌈 skies, there lived a princess named Snow White 🌸. She had skin as white as snow 🌨️, lips as red as roses 🌹, and hair as black as night 🌙.  

Her stepmother, the Queen 🤖, was jealous of Snow White’s beauty. She ordered a hunter 🐾 to take Snow White deep into the forest 🌲🌳🌳 and never return. But the hunter couldn’t bring himself to hurt her. Instead, he let her go 🏃‍♀️💨.  

Snow White wandered into the woods 🌲🌳🌳🌳 and found a cottage 🏠. Inside lived seven dwarfs 🧑‍🦴. They were grumpy at first 🙄, but Snow White was kind and helpful 🧹✨. She cleaned their home 🧹✨ and cooked for them 🍲.  

The dwarfs loved her so much they let her stay 🏠❤️. They gave her a bed to sleep in 🛏️💤. But one day, the Queen 🤖 discovered Snow White was still alive. She disguised herself as an old woman 🧓 and brought Snow White a poisoned apple 🍎.  

Snow White took a bite 🍎 and fell into a deep sleep 🛌💤. The dwarfs couldn’t wake her up 🤔. They placed her in a glass coffin 🪧 and kept her safe 🛡️.  

Years passed 🕰️. A prince 🤵 came to the forest 🌲🌳🌳🌳 and saw Snow White sleeping in the coffin 🪧. He kissed her 🤍, and she woke up 🌟.  

They got married 🤵👩‍👧 and lived happily ever after 🥰.
