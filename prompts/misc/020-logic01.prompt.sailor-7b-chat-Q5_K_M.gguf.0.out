If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

A theory that proves itself is logically consistent. A theory that cannot be disproven is not necessarily consistent. For example, a statement that is false cannot be disproven and therefore cannot be logically inconsistent.<|im_end|>
