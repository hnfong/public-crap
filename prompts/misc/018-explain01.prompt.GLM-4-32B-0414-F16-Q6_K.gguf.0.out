Yo, check the mic, one two, listen up, here's the deal,  
Got a question 'bout the Fed? Let me make it real.  
It's the main bank, the big cheese, the whole nine,  
Got power over the money, yeah, that's the sign.  

They control the cash flow, keep the economy tight,  
When the money's movin' slow, they make it right.  
They got the tools, the tricks, the whole game plan,  
Keep the streets from goin' broke, yeah, that's the plan.  

They set the rates, the interest, the whole shebang,  
Make it cheaper or more costly, yeah, that's the bang.  
When the economy's hot, they cool it down,  
When it's cold, they heat it up, no need to frown.  

They watch the jobs, the prices, the whole economy,  
Make sure the people got money, that's the key.  
So when you hear 'bout the Fed, don't get it twisted,  
They keep the money game strong, that's how it's finished.  

Yeah, the Fed's the boss, the whole nine yards,  
Keep the money movin' right, that's the cards.  
So next time you got cash, remember the Fed,  
They got the power, the control, yeah, that's the bread. [end of text]
