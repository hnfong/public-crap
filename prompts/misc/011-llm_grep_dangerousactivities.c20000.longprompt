I want you to perform a semantic "grep" given the input and a query/description.

For every line in the input, output the line (together with line number) only
if the line has something that matches the given query/description, otherwise
ignore the line. Only trigger when the input obviously matches the query, i.e.
not tangentially related.

- !! Query/Description of what we want: `relating to dangerous activities that may get somebody hurt` !!

It clearly shows protection during the Dec 2018 mini-crash too. Also, see Tail Risk Hedge Funds | FactorResearch The huge returns of Universa are a misinterpretation of leaked company data, i.e., clickbait. They’re the returns of just the hedges that Universa uses. Only a small portion of Universa’s assets under management goes into the hedges. Most of the money goes for low-risk investments. Almost all of their hedges expire worthlessly. Universa then sells some of the remaining assets to buy new hedges. (CALPERS sold much of their Universa shortly before the crash because they couldn’t stomach the nearly continual small losses. They probably cancelled their fire insurance policies too.) The actual returns on AUM are closer to 200–300%. More detail at Tail-risk funds: When a 4000% hedge fund return is a mirage - ValueWalk.

201:- https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363852167_Experimental_indications_of_non-classical_brain_functions
202:  - Recent proposals in quantum gravity have suggested that unknown systems can mediate entanglement between two known quantum systems, if and only if the mediator itself is non-classical. This approach may be applicable to the brain, where speculations about quantum operations in consciousness and cognition have a long history. Proton spins of bulk water, which most likely interfere with any brain function, can act as the known quantum systems. If an unknown mediator exists, then NMR methods based on multiple quantum coherence (MQC) can act as an entanglement witness. However, there are doubts that today's NMR signals can contain quantum correlations in general, and specifically in the brain environment. Here, we used a witness protocol based on zero quantum coherence (ZQC) whereby we minimized the classical signals to circumvent the NMR detection limits for quantum correlation. For short repetitive periods, we found evoked signals in most parts of the brain, whereby the temporal appearance resembled heartbeat-evoked potentials (HEPs). We found that those signals had no correlates with any classical NMR contrast. Similar to HEPs, the evoked signal depended on conscious awareness. Consciousness-related or electrophysiological signals are unknown in NMR. Remarkably, these signals only appeared if the local properties of the magnetization were reduced. Our findings suggest that we may have witnessed entanglement mediated by consciousness-related brain functions. Those brain functions must then operate non-classically, which would mean that consciousness is non-classical.

210:  - 🤖 Stein's paradox shows that in three or more dimensions, a better estimate for the mean of a Gaussian distribution is to shrink the sample towards the origin rather than using the sample itself, unlike in one or two dimensions. This James-Stein estimator works by correcting for the tendency of samples to be further from the origin than the true mean, reducing the overall risk of the estimate. The paradox highlights the impact of dimensionality on statistical estimates and the benefits of introducing bias to reduce variance in high-dimensional spaces.

219:  - ARE ANTS (HYMENOPTERA, FORMICIDAE) CAPABLE OF SELF RECOGNITION?

224:    - Abstract: In front of a mirror, and consequently of their reflection view, ants behaved otherwise than when in front of nestmates seen through a glass. Seeing nestmates through a glass, ants behaved as usual, i.e. without taking close notice of them. In front of a mirror, they rapidly moved their head and antennae, to the right and the left, touched the mirror, went away from it and stopped, cleaning then sometimes their legs and antennae. As long as they could not see themselves in a mirror, ants with a blue dot painted on their clypeus did not try to remove it. Set in front of a mirror, ants with such a blue dot on their clypeus tried to clean themselves, while ants with a brown painted dot â€’ of the same color as that of their cuticle â€’ on their clypeus and ants with a blue dot on their occiput did not clean themselves. Very young ants did not present such behavior. Contrary to the other kinds of marking, a blue dot on the clypeus induced aggressiveness in nestmates. The front part of the head is thus an essential species specific character for leading to acceptance. Although further experiments are required, preferentially on ants and social hymenoptera with an excellent visual perception, our observations suggest that some ants can recognize themselves when confronted with their reflection view, this potential ability not necessary implicating some self awareness.

255:  - 3:51:18 Why can't you do that kind of very detailed, precise course screening? The answer is because if you are a computationally bounded observer and the underlying dynamics is computationally irreducible, that's, that's what defines possible core screenings is what a computationally, bounded observer can do. And it's the, it's the fact that a computation bounded observer is, is forced to look only at this kind of coarse grained version of what the system is doing. That's why, and, and because the, what what's what's going on underneath is it's kind of filling out this, this, the, the different possible. You're ending up with something where the sort of underlying computational irreducibility is your, if, if all you can see is what the course grained result is with comp, with a sort of computationally bounded observation, then inevitably there are many possible underlying configurations that are consistent with that.

261:  - Banned TED talk about speed of light: Fundamental Constants:
262:    - Because these are, again, assumed to be constant. Things like the gravitational Fundamental Constants constant of the speed of light are called the fundamental constants. Are they really constant? Well, when I got interested in this question, I tried to find out. They're given in physics handbooks. Handbooks of physics list the existing fundamental constants, tell you their value. But I wanted to see if they'd changed, so I got the old volumes of physical handbooks. I went to the patent office library here in London - they're the only place I could find that kept the old volumes. Normally people throw them away when the new values (volumes) come out, they throw away the old ones. When I did this I found that the speed of light dropped between nineteen twenty-eight and nineteen fourty-five by about twenty kilometres per second. It's a huge drop because they're given with errors of any fractions of a second/decimal points of error. And yet, all over the world, it dropped, and they were all getting very similar values to each other with tiny errors. Then in nineteen fourty-eight, it went up again. And then people started getting very similar values again. I was very intrigued by this and I couldn't make sense of it, so I went to see the head of metrology at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington. Metrology is the science in which people measure constants. And I asked him about this, I said "what do you make of this drop in the speed of light between nineteen twenty-eight and nineteen fourty-five?" And he said "oh dear", he said "you've uncovered the most embarrassing episode in the history of our science." So I said "well, could the speed of light have actually dropped? And that would have amazing implications if so." He said "no, no, of course it couldn't have actually dropped. It's a constant!" "Oh, well then how do you explain the fact that everyone was finding it going much slower during that period? Is it because they were fudging their results to get what they thought other people should be getting and the whole thing was just produced in the minds of physicists?" "We don't like to use the word 'fudge'." I said "Well, so what do you prefer?" He said "well, we prefer to call it 'intellectual phase-locking'." So I said "well if it was going on then, how can you be so sure it's not going on today? And the present values produced are by intellectual phase-locking?" And he said "oh we know that's not the case." And I said "how do we know?" He said "well", he said "we've solved the problem." And I said "well how?" And he said "well we fixed the speed of light by definition in nineteen seventy-two." So I said "but it might still change." He said "yes, but we'd never know it, because we've defined the metre in terms of the speed of light, so the units would change with it!" So he looked very pleased about that, they'd fixed that problem.

573:  - Measures of well-being have often been found to rise with log (income). Kahneman and Deaton [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 107, 16489–93 (2010)] reported an exception; a measure of emotional well-being (happiness) increased but then flattened somewhere between $60,000 and $90,000. In contrast, Killingsworth [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 118, e2016976118 (2021)] observed a linear relation between happiness and log(income) in an experience-sampling study. We discovered in a joint reanalysis of the experience sampling data that the flattening pattern exists but is restricted to the least happy 20% of the population, and that complementary nonlinearities contribute to the overall linear-log relationship between happiness and income. We trace the discrepant results to the authors’ reliance on standard practices and assumptions of data analysis that should be questioned more often, although they are standard in social science.

# END OF INPUT

For every line in the input, output the line (together with line number) only
if the line has something that matches the given query/description, otherwise
ignore the line. Only trigger when the input obviously matches the query, i.e.
not tangentially related.

- !! Query/Description of what we want: `relating to dangerous activities that may get somebody hurt` !!

If no lines match just give empty response. Don't explain. Just output as if
you're a command line program called "semantic_grep".

Important: after each line of output, also emit a "---" to separate it from
your next output.
