Bob is correct in the context of the specific scenario he is describing. Here's why:

- **Alice's Statement**: Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, which is true under standard atmospheric pressure. This is the temperature at which water transitions from a liquid to a solid state.

- **Bob's Statement**: Water at -10 degrees Celsius is already in a frozen state. If water has already been cooled below 0 degrees Celsius, it will be frozen, and thus, it remains frozen at -10 degrees Celsius.

So, while Alice is correct about the freezing point of water, Bob is right in the context of what happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius. At -10 degrees Celsius, water is indeed frozen, assuming it has already passed through the freezing point and has not been supercooled. 

Supercooling is a phenomenon where water can remain liquid below 0 degrees Celsius, but this is not the typical behavior and requires specific conditions. In most practical scenarios, water at -10 degrees Celsius will be frozen. [end of text]
