**A) Yes.**
Under standard atmospheric pressure, pure water freezes at 0°C. Since -12°C is significantly below this freezing point, water will exist as a solid (ice) at this temperature.

**B) The water will freeze into ice.**
As the pure water cools, it will reach 0°C and begin to undergo a phase change from liquid to solid. Once the entire volume has frozen and released its latent heat, the temperature of the resulting ice will continue to drop until it reaches -12°C.

*Note: In very specific, controlled laboratory conditions with perfectly still, pure water, a phenomenon called "supercooling" can temporarily keep water liquid below 0°C. However, in any typical real-world scenario (like a glass on a counter), impurities or vibrations will trigger immediate freezing once the temperature hits 0°C, ensuring it is solid ice by the time it reaches -12°C.* [end of text]
