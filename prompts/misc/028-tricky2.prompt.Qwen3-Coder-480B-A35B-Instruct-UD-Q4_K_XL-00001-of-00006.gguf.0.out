Alice is right.

Water freezes at 0°C (32°F) under normal atmospheric pressure. At -10°C, water would already be frozen - this temperature is 10 degrees below the freezing point. Bob's statement is incorrect because he's stating that water freezes *at* -10°C, when in fact it freezes at 0°C and would be solid ice at -10°C. [end of text]
