Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

A clever exchange!

**Alice is right, and Bob is wrong (despite his claim)**.

Here's why:

* Alice correctly states that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (°C) under standard atmospheric pressure.
* Bob incorrectly states that water freezes at -10°C.
* Bob's subsequent claim that he's "still right" is incorrect because his initial statement was factually wrong. At -10°C, water is **already frozen** (having frozen at 0°C), but it doesn't **start** freezing at -10°C. [end of text]
