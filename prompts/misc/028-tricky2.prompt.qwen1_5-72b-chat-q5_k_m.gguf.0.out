Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Alice is correct. Water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10 degrees Celsius, water would not freeze under normal conditions; it would remain liquid, although it would approach its freezing point and could freeze if the temperature continued to drop or if there were other factors, such as increased pressure or the presence of impurities, that could lower its freezing point. So, Bob's statement is not accurate in the general sense. [end of text]
