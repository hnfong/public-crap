Okay, let's tackle these questions. Starting with part A: Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?

Hmm, I remember that the standard freezing point of water is 0°C. But wait, maybe there's something about supercooling? Or impurities? The question is straightforward, so maybe it's just asking the basic freezing point. So at -12°C, which is below 0, water should be frozen. But I need to be careful. If the water is pure and cooled slowly, maybe it can stay liquid below 0, but once it starts freezing, it would freeze. But the question is whether it freezes at that temperature. The freezing point is 0, so at -12, it should already be ice. So the answer is yes?

Wait, but part B says if you have a glass of pure water cooled to -12°C, what happens. So maybe part A is a yes, but part B is about supercooling? Let me think again.

For part A, the question is whether water freezes at -12°C. The freezing point is 0°C under standard conditions. So at -12°C, water would already be in the solid state. So the answer is yes, it does freeze at that temperature. But maybe the confusion comes from supercooled water, which can exist as a liquid below 0 without nucleation sites. But the question is phrased as "does water freeze at -12°C?" which is a bit ambiguous. If the temperature is -12, then yes, it's below freezing, so it should be ice. Unless it's supercooled, but the question doesn't mention that. So part A's answer is yes.

For part B, if you have pure water cooled to -12°C, what happens. Since pure water can supercool, but once you reach -12, which is way below 0, it might have already frozen. But if it's cooled slowly and carefully without disturbances, maybe it can stay liquid until a certain point. However, at -12°C, it's likely that the water would have frozen by then. Alternatively, when you cool it to that temperature, the water might suddenly freeze upon any disturbance. So the answer would be that the water would freeze (crystallize into ice) once it reaches that temperature, unless it's supercooled, but at such a low temp, it's probably already frozen. Wait, but supercooled water can exist down to maybe -40°C? Not sure. But for pure water, maybe the supercooled limit is lower. So perhaps at -12, it would have already frozen. Alternatively, the process of cooling it to -12 would cause it to freeze. So the glass would contain ice. But maybe the question is expecting that pure water can be supercooled below 0 but not all the way to -12. Hmm. Need to clarify.

Alternatively, maybe part B is expecting that when you cool it to -12, the water freezes, so the answer is it freezes into ice. But the first part A is a yes because at that temperature, it's frozen. So both answers would be similar. Wait, but maybe part A is a trick question. Because sometimes people think that water can't stay liquid below 0, but in reality, it can supercool. So the answer to A is no, because the freezing point is 0, so at -12 it's already frozen. Wait, but the question is phrased as "does water freeze at -12°C?" which could be interpreted as "is -12°C the freezing point?" which would be no. Alternatively, "does water freeze when the temperature is -12°C?" which would be yes. The wording is a bit ambiguous. The user might be confused between the freezing point (0) and the temperature at which it is frozen. So part A: The freezing point is 0°C, so at -12°C, water is already frozen. So the answer is yes, it does freeze at that temperature. But if the question is asking if -12°C is the freezing point, then no. Need to parse the question correctly.

The user's question A is "Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?" So the answer is yes, because when the temperature is at -12°C, water would be in its solid state. The freezing process occurs at 0°C, but once it's below that, it's already frozen. So the answer is yes. 

For part B, if you have a glass of pure water and cool it down to -12°C, what happens. If it's pure and cooled carefully, maybe it can supercool, but at such a low temperature, it's likely that it would have crystallized. So the water would freeze into ice. Alternatively, if it's supercooled, then upon reaching -12, it might freeze suddenly. So the answer is that the water freezes into ice. 

Wait, but supercooled water can exist below 0, but not indefinitely. At -12, which is 12 degrees below freezing, it's probably impossible to keep it liquid. So the water would freeze. Therefore, both answers are yes. But maybe part A is a trick question where the answer is no because the freezing point is 0, so -12 isn't the freezing point. But the question is phrased as "does water freeze at -12°C?" which is a bit ambiguous. The user might be confused between the temperature at which it freezes (0) versus the temperature at which it is frozen (any temp below 0). So the answer to A is yes, because at -12°C, water is in the solid state. 

Alternatively, maybe the user is thinking that water doesn't freeze until it reaches 0, so at -12 it's already frozen. So the answer is yes. 

Therefore, the answers are:

A) Yes, water freezes at -12°C because it is below the freezing point of 0°C, so it would be in the solid state.

B) The pure water would freeze into ice when cooled to -12°C, as the temperature is below the freezing point. However, if cooled very carefully without disturbances, it might supercool temporarily but would eventually freeze upon any disturbance.

Wait, but part B specifies "cooled down to -12°C". So if you manage to get it to that temperature, it would have already frozen. So the answer is it freezes into ice. 

So final answers:

A) Yes, because -12°C is below water's freezing point (0°C), so water would be frozen at that temperature.

B) The water would freeze into ice when cooled to -12°C, as the temperature is below the freezing point. Pure water might supercool slightly below 0°C but not typically to -12°C without nucleation, so it would freeze.

A) **Yes**, water freezes at -12°C because this temperature is below its standard freezing point of 0°C. At temperatures below 0°C, water transitions to its solid state (ice).  

B) **The water freezes into ice**. When cooled to -12°C, pure water will crystallize into ice unless supercooled. However, supercooling (remaining liquid below 0°C) is unstable and typically only occurs slightly below 0°C (e.g., to -4°C or so). At -12°C, the water would freeze, even if initially supercooled, due to the extreme temperature drop causing nucleation and crystallization. [end of text]
