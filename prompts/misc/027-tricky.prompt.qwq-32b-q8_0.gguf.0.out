Answer the following questions with brief explanations.

A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?
B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?

Okay, let's tackle these questions. Starting with part A: Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius? Hmm, I remember that the freezing point of water is 0°C under standard conditions. But maybe there's something else here. Wait, sometimes impurities can lower the freezing point, but the question is about pure water. So if it's pure, then freezing should start at 0°C. But maybe if it's supercooled? Wait, supercooled water can stay liquid below 0°C, but that's not the same as the freezing point. The actual freezing point is still 0°C. So the answer to A is no, because water freezes at 0°C, not -12.

Now part B: If you have a glass of pure water and cool it to -12°C, what happens? Well, if you cool it below 0°C, pure water usually freezes, right? But if it's cooled slowly, maybe it would freeze at 0°C. But if you cool it really fast, maybe it can supercool. But supercooled water is unstable. If you reach -12°C, that's way below 0. So maybe it would freeze once you reach that temperature. Wait, but how can you get it to -12 without it freezing already? Maybe if it's supercooled all the way down, but at some point it would crystallize. Alternatively, maybe it can't stay liquid that low and would freeze upon reaching that temp. So the water would freeze when cooled to -12°C. But I need to be precise. The process might involve it freezing as it's cooled past 0, but if it's supercooled, maybe it stays liquid until some disturbance causes it to freeze. But the question says "cooled down to -12", so perhaps by the time it reaches that temp, it would have already frozen. Alternatively, maybe it can't exist as liquid at -12, so it must be solid. So the answer is it would freeze into ice.

A) **No.** Water freezes at **0°C** under standard atmospheric pressure. While impurities can lower the freezing point, pure water freezes at 0°C. Temperatures below this (e.g., -12°C) would already have caused the water to freeze.  

B) **It freezes.** When pure water is cooled below 0°C, it can temporarily supercool (remain liquid) if disturbances (e.g., nucleation sites) are minimized. However, reaching -12°C is far below the freezing point, so the water would eventually crystallize into ice, even if supercooled initially. Cooling to such a low temperature would destabilize the liquid phase, causing rapid freezing. [end of text]
