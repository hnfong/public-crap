Okay, the user wants a Snow White story written exclusively in emojis. Let me start by recalling the classic tale's key elements: Snow White, the evil queen, the dwarfs, the poisoned apple, and the happy ending. Since I can't use any text, I need to convey these elements through emojis effectively.

First, I should outline the story structure. Beginning with Snow White's innocence, then the queen's jealousy, the encounter in the forest, the dwarfs' help, the poisoned apple, and the revival. Each part needs emojis that represent the actions and emotions.

I need to ensure the emojis are clear and flow well. For example, using 👩‍❄️ for Snow White, 👑 for the queen, 🧟‍♀️ for the witch, and 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 for the dwarfs. Actions like running, sleeping, and waking up should have corresponding emojis. The poisoned apple could be 🍎 with a 👻 or 👻 emoji to indicate it's cursed.

I should also maintain the story's pacing with emojis. Short sentences or phrases in emojis can keep it engaging. For instance, 🌲🌳🌲 for the forest, 👑👁️ 👑 for the queen spotting her, and 🧑‍🤝‍🧑🧑‍🤝‍🧑 for the dwarfs.

I need to check if all emojis are appropriate and if the story makes sense without text. Maybe add some emojis for the dwarfs' names, like 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 (Doc), 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 (Grumpy), etc., but since the user didn't specify, I can keep it simple.

Finally, ensure the ending is happy with 🎉🎉🎉 and a kiss for Snow White and Prince. The user might appreciate creativity, so adding some unique emojis where possible could enhance the story.
