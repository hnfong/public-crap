Okay, let me try to figure out this Magic: The Gathering problem. So, Alice has two copies of Kindle in her hand, and Bob has Orim, Samite Healer in play. Alice wants to kill Orim, and it's her turn. I need to figure out the optimal play for both players.

First, let me recall what Kindle does. The problem says Kindle is an instant: "Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards." So, the damage depends on how many Kindles are in all graveyards. Since Alice has two in hand, if she casts one, it would go to the graveyard, but the other is still in hand. Wait, but when she casts a spell, it's not in the graveyard yet. So, when she casts the first Kindle, the number of Kindles in graveyards would be zero because it's still in hand. Wait, no—when you cast a spell, it's on the stack, and then when it resolves, it goes to the graveyard. So, the damage calculation happens when the spell resolves, so the number of Kindles in graveyards at that moment.

But Alice has two Kindles in hand. If she casts one, then when it resolves, the graveyard has zero Kindles (since the one she's casting hasn't resolved yet), so X would be 2 + 0 = 2. Then, after it resolves, that Kindle goes to the graveyard. Then, if she casts the second Kindle, when it resolves, the graveyard has one Kindle (the first one), so X would be 2 + 1 = 3. But wait, she can't cast both in the same turn unless she has enough mana, but the problem says she has sufficient mana. But the question is about optimal play.

Bob has Orim, which has the ability: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So, if Bob taps Orim, he can prevent the next 3 damage to any target. But Orim is a creature, so tapping it would use its ability. But Orim is untapped, so Bob can tap it during his turn or during Alice's turn? Wait, the turn is Alice's turn, so Bob's turn hasn't come yet. So, during Alice's turn, Bob can't activate abilities unless it's during his own turn. Wait, no—abilities can be activated during the active player's turn. So, since it's Alice's turn, Bob can't activate Orim's ability until his own turn. But the problem says "it is now Alice's turn," so Bob's turn is after Alice's. So, during Alice's turn, Bob can't do anything. So, Orim's ability can't be used to prevent damage during Alice's turn. Wait, but Orim's ability is a tap ability, which can be activated at any time when you have priority, but only during your own turn? No, tap abilities can be activated during the active player's turn. Wait, no—any player can activate abilities when they have priority. So, during Alice's turn, Bob can activate Orim's ability if he wants to, but he might not want to because he's trying to prevent damage to Orim. Wait, but Orim is the target, so if Alice is about to deal damage to Orim, Bob could tap Orim to prevent the next 3 damage to Orim. But since it's Alice's turn, Bob can activate Orim's ability during Alice's turn, right? Because the active player is Alice, but Bob can still activate abilities when he has priority. Wait, the turn structure: during the main phase, players get priority in turn order. So, Alice has priority first, then Bob. So, Alice can cast spells, then Bob can respond. But Orim's ability is a tap ability, which can be activated at any time when you have priority. So, if Alice casts a spell that deals damage to Orim, Bob could tap Orim to prevent that damage. But the ability says "Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So, if Bob taps Orim, then the next 3 damage to any target (including Orim) is prevented. Wait, no: "Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So, it's preventing damage to any target, not just Orim. But Bob would want to prevent damage to Orim, so he'd use it to prevent damage to Orim.

But let's think step by step. Alice has two Kindles. She wants to deal damage to Orim. Orim has 1 toughness, so she needs to deal 1 damage to kill it. But with Kindle, the damage depends on the number of Kindles in graveyards.

First, let's consider if Alice casts one Kindle. When she casts it, the damage is 2 + (number of Kindles in graveyards). At the time of casting, the graveyard has no Kindles (since she's casting one from hand), so X=2. So, it deals 2 damage to Orim. Orim has 1 toughness, so 2 damage would kill it. But wait, Orim is a 1/3 creature, so 1 damage would kill it. So, 2 damage would kill it. But Bob might prevent that damage.

Wait, but if Alice casts Kindle, it's on the stack. Then Bob can respond by tapping Orim to prevent the next 3 damage. So, when the Kindle resolves, it would deal 2 damage, but Bob has prevented it, so Orim takes 0 damage. Then, Orim is still alive. Then, Alice can cast the second Kindle. When she casts the second Kindle, the graveyard has one Kindle (the first one that resolved), so X=2+1=3. So, it would deal 3 damage to Orim. But Bob could have already used Orim's ability to prevent the first damage, but the ability says "the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So, if Bob taps Orim before the first Kindle resolves, then the next 3 damage (including the first Kindle's 2 damage) is prevented. So, the first Kindle's damage is prevented, and then the second Kindle's 3 damage would also be prevented, because it's the next 3 damage. Wait, the ability says "prevent the next 3 damage," so it's a one-time prevention of up to 3 damage. So, if the first Kindle deals 2 damage, that's prevented, and then the second Kindle deals 3 damage, but since the prevention is for the next 3 damage, the 3 damage would also be prevented. So, total damage prevented is 3, so both spells' damage is prevented.

Wait, but the ability says "prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So, it's a single prevention effect that applies to the next 3 damage, regardless of how many spells. So, if Bob taps Orim, then any damage that would be dealt to any target this turn (including Orim) up to 3 is prevented. So, if Alice casts two Kindles, the first deals 2, the second deals 3, total 5 damage. But Bob's prevention would prevent the first 3 damage, so the first 3 damage is prevented, but the remaining 2 (from the second Kindle) would still be dealt. Wait, no: the prevention is "the next 3 damage," so it's a single effect that prevents up to 3 damage. So, if the first spell deals 2, that's prevented, and the second spell deals 3, but the prevention effect has already used up 2 of the 3, so 1 more damage is prevented, and the remaining 2 damage from the second spell would be dealt. Wait, no—prevention effects work by reducing the damage. So, if a spell deals X damage, and you have a prevention effect that prevents Y damage, then the target takes max(0, X - Y) damage.

But Orim's ability says "prevent the next 3 damage," so it's a one-time prevention of 3 damage. So, if Alice casts a spell that deals 2 damage, that 2 is prevented. Then, if she casts another spell that deals 3 damage, the prevention effect would prevent 1 more damage (since 3 total prevention), so the 3 damage becomes 2. So, Orim would take 2 damage from the second spell, which would kill it (since it's 1/3, 2 damage is enough).

Wait, but Orim's ability is "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So, when Bob taps Orim, he's activating the ability, which creates a prevention effect that lasts until the end of the turn. So, the prevention effect is active for the rest of the turn. So, any damage that would be dealt to any target this turn is prevented up to 3. So, if Alice casts two spells, the first deals 2, which is prevented. The second deals 3, but the prevention effect has already prevented 2, so it prevents 1 more, leaving 2 damage. So, Orim takes 2 damage, which is enough to kill it (since it's 1 toughness).

But wait, Orim is a 1/3 creature, so it needs 1 damage to die. So, even 1 damage would kill it. So, if the prevention effect prevents 3 damage, but the first spell deals 2 (prevented), and the second deals 3 (prevented 1, so 2 left), then Orim takes 2 damage, which is more than enough to kill it.

But let's check the timing. Alice's turn: she can cast spells. She has two Kindles. She can cast one, then Bob can respond by tapping Orim to activate the ability. Then, when the first Kindle resolves, the damage is prevented. Then, she casts the second Kindle. When it resolves, the damage is reduced by the prevention effect. So, the second Kindle would deal 3 damage, but the prevention effect has already prevented 2 (from the first spell), so it prevents 1 more, so 2 damage is dealt. Orim takes 2 damage, dies.

But wait, the prevention effect is "the next 3 damage," so it's cumulative. So, the first 3 damage is prevented. So, if the first spell deals 2, that's part of the 3. The second spell deals 3, so the first 1 of that 3 is prevented, and the remaining 2 is dealt. So, total damage prevented is 3, and 2 damage is dealt. So, Orim dies.

But is there a way for Alice to kill Orim without Bob preventing it? Let's see. If Alice casts both Kindles at the same time, but she can't—she has to cast them one at a time. So, she casts the first Kindle. Bob can respond by tapping Orim. Then, the first Kindle's damage is prevented. Then, she casts the second Kindle. The second Kindle's damage is partially prevented.

But wait, what if Alice casts the second Kindle first? Wait, she has two in hand. The order might matter. Let's say she casts the second Kindle first. Wait, no, the number of Kindles in the graveyard depends on how many have resolved. So, if she casts the first Kindle, it goes to the graveyard after resolving. So, the second Kindle, when cast, will have one Kindle in the graveyard.

But if she casts the second Kindle first, but she has two in hand. Wait, no—she has two copies, so casting either one first. The damage calculation for the first spell is based on the graveyard state before it resolves. So, if she casts a Kindle, the graveyard has zero Kindles (since none have resolved yet), so X=2. Then, after it resolves, it's in the graveyard. Then, casting the second Kindle, the graveyard has one, so X=3.

So, the order is fixed: first Kindle deals 2, second deals 3.

Now, Bob's optimal play: he wants to prevent as much damage as possible. So, he should tap Orim as soon as possible to activate the prevention. So, when Alice casts the first Kindle, Bob can tap Orim to activate the ability, which will prevent the next 3 damage. Then, the first Kindle's 2 damage is prevented, and the second Kindle's 3 damage is reduced by 1 (since 3 total prevention), so 2 damage is dealt, killing Orim.

But wait, Orim is a 1/3 creature, so 1 damage kills it. So, even if only 1 damage is dealt, it dies. So, if the prevention effect prevents 3 damage, but the second Kindle deals 3, and the prevention effect prevents all 3, then Orim takes 0 damage. Wait, no: the prevention effect is "prevent the next 3 damage," so if the damage is 3, it's all prevented. So, if the second Kindle deals 3 damage, and the prevention effect has already prevented 2 from the first spell, then the remaining prevention is 1, so 1 damage is prevented, 2 is dealt. But if Bob activates the prevention before the first spell, then the first spell's 2 is prevented, and the second spell's 3 is reduced by 1 (since 3 total prevention), so 2 damage is dealt.

But let's clarify the prevention effect. The ability says "prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So, it's a single effect that prevents up to 3 damage. So, if the first spell deals 2, that's prevented. The second spell deals 3, so the prevention effect prevents 1 more (since 3 total), so 2 damage is dealt. So, Orim takes 2 damage, dies.

But is there a way for Bob to prevent all damage? If he activates the ability before any damage is dealt, then the next 3 damage is prevented. So, if Alice casts two spells, the first deals 2 (prevented), the second deals 3 (prevented 1, so 2 dealt). So, Orim dies.

Wait, but maybe Alice can cast both Kindles in a way that the damage is higher. Wait, no—she has two Kindles, so the first deals 2, the second deals 3. Total 5 damage, but prevention prevents 3, so 2 dealt.

But Orim only needs 1 damage to die, so 2 is enough.

But what if Alice casts only one Kindle? Then, it deals 2 damage. Bob can tap Orim to prevent that 2 damage, so Orim takes 0, survives. Then, Alice can't kill it with one Kindle. So, she needs to cast both.

But if she casts both, Bob can prevent 3 damage, so Orim takes 2 damage and dies.

Wait, but let's check the exact wording. "Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So, "the next 3 damage" means the first 3 damage that would be dealt. So, if the first spell deals 2, that's the first 2, then the second spell deals 3, so the next 1 damage is prevented, and the remaining 2 is dealt. So, yes, 2 damage is dealt.

But Orim has 1 toughness, so 2 damage is more than enough. So, Orim dies.

But is there a way for Bob to prevent all damage? If he could prevent more than 3, but he can't. The ability only prevents 3.

Wait, but what if Alice casts the second Kindle first? Wait, no, the number of Kindles in the graveyard depends on how many have resolved. So, if she casts the second Kindle first, it's still the same: the first spell (whether it's the first or second copy) will have 0 Kindles in the graveyard, so X=2. Then, the second spell will have 1, so X=3. So, the order of casting the two Kindles doesn't matter; the first one cast will deal 2, the second 3.

So, regardless of which one she casts first, the damage is 2 then 3.

Now, Bob's optimal play: he should activate Orim's ability as soon as possible to prevent the damage. So, when Alice casts the first Kindle, Bob can respond by tapping Orim to activate the ability. Then, the first Kindle's damage is prevented, and the second Kindle's damage is reduced by 1 (since 3 total prevention), so 2 damage is dealt, killing Orim.

But wait, is there a way for Bob to not activate the ability and let Orim die? No, because he wants to prevent Alice from killing Orim. So, he should activate the ability.

But let's confirm the timing. Alice casts Kindle (first one). Now, the stack has Kindle. Bob has priority, so he can activate Orim's ability. He taps Orim, which activates the ability, creating a prevention effect. Now, the stack has Kindle, and the prevention effect is active. Then, Alice can choose to let the Kindle resolve. When it resolves, it would deal 2 damage, but the prevention effect prevents it, so Orim takes 0. Then, Alice casts the second Kindle. Now, the stack has the second Kindle. Bob has priority again, but he can't activate Orim's ability again because it's a tap ability that can only be activated once per turn (since it's a creature ability, and you can't tap a creature twice in the same turn). Wait, Orim is a creature, so it can be tapped once per turn. So, Bob can tap it once, which activates the ability, and that's it for the turn. So, he can't tap it again. So, after he taps it to activate the ability, he can't do it again.

So, when Alice casts the second Kindle, Bob can't activate Orim's ability again. So, the prevention effect is already active, so the second Kindle's damage is reduced by the remaining prevention. Since the first spell's 2 damage was prevented, the prevention effect has 1 more damage to prevent. So, the second Kindle deals 3 damage, but 1 is prevented, so 2 is dealt. Orim takes 2 damage, dies.

So, in this case, Orim dies.

But wait, is there a way for Alice to kill Orim without Bob preventing it? If Bob doesn't activate the ability, then the first Kindle deals 2 damage, killing Orim. But Bob would want to prevent that, so he would activate the ability. So, Bob's optimal play is to activate the ability, which results in Orim taking 2 damage and dying. Wait, but if Bob activates the ability, Orim still dies. So, Bob can't save Orim. So, Bob's best play is to activate the ability, but it doesn't save Orim.

Wait, that's interesting. So, no matter what Bob does, Orim dies. Because even with the prevention, 2 damage is dealt, which is enough to kill it.

Let me verify the damage calculation again. First Kindle: X=2 (since no Kindles in graveyard), deals 2 damage. Bob activates Orim's ability, preventing the next 3 damage. So, the 2 damage is prevented. Then, second Kindle: X=2 + 1 (since one Kindle is in graveyard), so X=3. The prevention effect has already prevented 2, so it prevents 1 more, so 3 - 1 = 2 damage is dealt. Orim has 1 toughness, so 2 damage kills it.

Yes, so Orim dies regardless of Bob's action. If Bob doesn't activate the ability, the first Kindle deals 2 damage, killing Orim immediately. If he does activate it, the second Kindle deals 2 damage, killing Orim. So, Bob can't save Orim.

Wait, but if Bob doesn't activate the ability, Alice can just cast one Kindle, deal 2 damage, kill Orim. So, Bob's best play is to activate the ability, but it doesn't help him. So, the optimal play for Bob is to activate the ability, but it's irrelevant because Orim still dies.

So, the optimal play for Alice is to cast both Kindles. First, cast one Kindle. Bob will respond by tapping Orim to activate the ability. Then, cast the second Kindle. The second Kindle's damage is reduced to 2, killing Orim.

But wait, can Alice cast both Kindles in one turn? Yes, she has sufficient mana.

Is there a way for Alice to cast the second Kindle before Bob can respond? No, because after casting the first Kindle, Bob gets priority to respond.

So, the sequence is:

1. Alice casts Kindle (first one). Stack: Kindle.

2. Bob has priority. He taps Orim to activate the ability. Now, the prevention effect is active.

3. Alice has priority. She lets the Kindle resolve. It deals 2 damage, but it's prevented. Orim takes 0.

4. Alice casts the second Kindle. Stack: second Kindle.

5. Bob has priority, but he can't activate Orim's ability again (already tapped). So, he passes.

6. Alice lets the second Kindle resolve. It deals 3 damage, but the prevention effect prevents 1 (since 3 total prevention, 2 already used), so 2 damage is dealt. Orim takes 2 damage, dies.

So, Orim dies.

Alternatively, if Bob doesn't activate the ability:

1. Alice casts Kindle. Stack: Kindle.

2. Bob passes.

3. Kindle resolves, deals 2 damage, Orim dies.

So, in this case, Orim dies immediately. So, Bob's best play is to activate the ability, but it doesn't save Orim. So, regardless of Bob's action, Orim dies.

Therefore, the optimal play for Alice is to cast both Kindles. Bob's optimal play is to activate Orim's ability, but it doesn't change the outcome.

Wait, but let's confirm the damage calculation. When the second Kindle resolves, the number of Kindles in graveyards is 1 (the first one), so X=2+1=3. The prevention effect prevents the next 3 damage. The first spell's damage was 2, which was prevented. So, the prevention effect has 1 more damage to prevent. So, the second spell's 3 damage is reduced by 1, so 2 damage is dealt. Orim has 1 toughness, so 2 damage is lethal.

Yes.

Another angle: if Alice casts the second Kindle first. Wait, but the number of Kindles in the graveyard is based on how many have resolved. So, if she casts the second Kindle first, it's still the same: the first spell (whether it's the first or second copy) will have 0 Kindles in the graveyard, so X=2. Then, the second spell will have 1, X=3. So, the order doesn't matter.

So, regardless of which Kindle she casts first, the damage is 2 then 3.

Therefore, the optimal play for Alice is to cast both Kindles. Bob's optimal play is to activate Orim's ability, but it doesn't save Orim.

So, the outcome is that Orim dies, and Alice wins the game.

Wait, but let's make sure about the prevention effect. The ability says "prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn." So, "any target" means that the prevention applies to damage dealt to any target, not just Orim. But Bob wants to prevent damage to Orim, so he's using it to prevent damage to Orim. But the prevention effect is active for the rest of the turn, so it would prevent damage to any target, but since Alice is targeting Orim, it's relevant.

Another thing: Orim's ability is a tap ability, so Bob has to tap Orim to activate it. Since Orim is untapped, he can do that.

Also, the problem states that Bob's lands are tapped out, so he can't play more lands, but he can activate abilities of creatures he has.

So, putting it all together, Alice's optimal play is to cast both Kindles. Bob's optimal play is to activate Orim's ability, but it doesn't prevent Orim from dying.

Therefore, the outcome is that Orim dies, and Alice successfully kills it.

### Optimal Play Analysis for Alice and Bob

#### **Game State Summary**
- **Alice's Hand**: 2 copies of *Kindle* (Instant: "Deals X damage to any target, where X = 2 + number of *Kindle* cards in all graveyards").
- **Bob's Board**: *Orim, Samite Healer* (1/3, Legendary Creature, "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn").
- **Turn**: Alice's turn (Bob's turn is after Alice's).
- **Mana**: Alice has sufficient mana to cast both *Kindle* spells.
- **Bob's Lands**: Tapped out (cannot play new lands, but can activate abilities).

---

### **Key Mechanics to Consider**
1. **Damage Calculation for *Kindle***:
   - When *Kindle* resolves, **X = 2 + (number of *Kindle* cards in all graveyards at resolution time)**.
   - **First *Kindle* cast**: Graveyard has 0 *Kindle* cards → X = 2.
   - **Second *Kindle* cast**: Graveyard has 1 *Kindle* card (from the first resolved spell) → X = 3.

2. **Orim's Ability**:
   - "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."
   - **Activation Timing**: Bob can activate this ability during **Alice's turn** (when he has priority), but **only once per turn** (since *Orim* is tapped and cannot be tapped again).
   - **Effect**: Prevents up to 3 damage total (not per spell), applied to the **next 3 damage** dealt to **any target** this turn.

3. **Orim's Toughness**: 1 (needs **1+ damage** to die).

---

### **Optimal Play for Alice**
Alice's goal: **Kill Orim** (1/3) with minimal risk.  
**Optimal Sequence**:
1. **Cast the first *Kindle*** (targeting Orim).
   - **Damage**: X = 2 (graveyard has 0 *Kindle* cards).
   - **Stack**: *Kindle* is on the stack.

2. **Bob's Response**:
   - Bob has priority and **activates *Orim*'s ability** (taps *Orim*).
   - **Effect**: Prevents the next 3 damage to any target this turn.

3. **First *Kindle* Resolves**:
   - Damage = 2, but **prevented** by *Orim*'s ability.
   - **Result**: Orim takes **0 damage** (still alive).

4. **Cast the second *Kindle*** (targeting Orim).
   - **Damage**: X = 3 (graveyard now has 1 *Kindle* card).
   - **Stack**: Second *Kindle* is on the stack.

5. **Second *Kindle* Resolves**:
   - Total damage prevented so far: **2** (from first spell).
   - Remaining prevention: **1** (3 total - 2 used).
   - **Actual damage dealt**: 3 - 1 = **2**.
   - **Result**: Orim takes **2 damage** → **dies** (1 toughness).

---

### **Optimal Play for Bob**
Bob's goal: **Prevent Orim from dying**.  
**Optimal Action**:
- **Activate *Orim*'s ability** as soon as possible (after Alice casts the first *Kindle*).
- **Why?** This prevents the **next 3 damage** (total), which covers:
  - First *Kindle*'s 2 damage (prevented).
  - Part of the second *Kindle*'s 3 damage (1 prevented, 2 dealt).
- **Why not skip activation?** If Bob **does not activate**, the first *Kindle* deals 2 damage → Orim dies immediately. Bob **must activate** to minimize damage, but **it cannot save Orim**.

---

### **Outcome**
- **Orim dies** regardless of Bob's action.
  - **If Bob activates *Orim*'s ability**: Second *Kindle* deals 2 damage → Orim dies.
  - **If Bob does not activate**: First *Kindle* deals 2 damage → Orim dies.
- **Bob's action is irrelevant**—Orim dies in both cases.  
- **Alice's optimal play**: Cast **both *Kindle* spells** (no other option works).

---

### **Why This is Optimal**
- **Alice cannot kill Orim with one *Kindle*** (2 damage would kill it, but Bob can prevent it if he activates *Orim*).
- **Bob cannot prevent Orim from dying** because:
  - The **total damage** from both *Kindle* spells is **5** (2 + 3).
  - *Orim*'s ability only prevents **3 damage**, leaving **2 damage** to be dealt (enough to kill Orim).
- **No alternative plays** for Alice (e.g., casting one *Kindle* and waiting) would work, as Bob would prevent the damage.

---

### **Final Outcome**
- **Alice wins**: Orim is killed by the second *Kindle* (2 damage dealt after prevention).
- **Bob's optimal play** (activating *Orim*'s ability) **does not change the result**—Orim dies either way.

---

### **Summary of Key Rules (MTG 2024)**
- **Prevention Effects**: "Prevent the next X damage" applies to **all damage** in sequence (not per spell).  
  - *Example*: 2 damage prevented by first spell, 1 damage prevented by second spell → 2 damage dealt.
- **Ability Activation**: Players can activate abilities during **their own or opponent's turn** when they have priority (Bob can activate *Orim* during Alice's turn).
- **Tapping Creatures**: A tapped creature cannot be tapped again until the next turn (so *Orim*'s ability can only be activated once per turn).

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Alice's Optimal Play**: Cast both *Kindle* spells (first to trigger the ability, second to deal lethal damage).
- **Bob's Optimal Play**: Activate *Orim*'s ability (but it fails to save Orim).
- **Result**: **Orim dies**, Alice wins the game.  
- **Critical Insight**: Bob's prevention ability is **insufficient** to save Orim due to the **cumulative damage** from two *Kindle* spells. [end of text]
