Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10 degrees Celsius, water is already frozen (solid ice), but it does not "freeze" at that temperature because freezing is the process of transitioning from liquid to solid, which occurs at 0Â°C. Bob's statement is incorrect because it misrepresents the freezing point of water. [end of text]
