Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is right. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). The freezing point of water is the temperature at which it changes from a liquid to a solid state. At -10 degrees Celsius, the water will be in a solid state, which is ice. The freezing point of water is a well-known fact and is a fundamental property of water. [end of text]
