Yo, listen up, let me break it down, no cap,  
The Fed’s like the big boss, runnin’ the cash stack,  
They ain’t just countin’ money, nah, they control the rate,  
Like the DJ with the turntables, settin’ the pace of the state.

They print the paper, but they ain’t just handin’ it out,  
They decide when to drop the loot, when to tighten it up,  
If the economy gettin’ too wild, too hype, too loud,  
They cool it down, slow it up, keep it from crashin’ the crowd.

They got the banks on a short leash, keepin’ ‘em in line,  
If a bank startin’ to wobble, the Fed might drop a sign,  
Like, “Yo, you need to chill, don’t let your money sink,”  
They throw a lifeline, keep the whole system from stink.

Inflation gettin’ outta hand? They raise the interest,  
Make loans cost more, so folks ain’t spendin’ too reckless,  
If the people need help, they can drop some stimulus,  
Like throwin’ a big bag of cash, so the economy can get busy again.

So the Fed’s like the referee, keepin’ the game fair,  
Makin’ sure the money moves right, and nobody cheat there,  
They ain’t perfect, but they try to keep the beat steady,  
So the whole nation don’t go broke, and we keep gettin’ that bread, G. [end of text]
