Answer the following questions with brief explanations.

A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?
B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?
A) **Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?**

Yes, water freezes at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of pure water is 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm). However, at lower temperatures, such as -12 degrees Celsius, water is already in its solid state (ice).

B) **I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?**

If the glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, the water will freeze into ice. This is because the temperature is well below the freezing point of water (0 degrees Celsius), causing the liquid water molecules to lose energy and form a crystalline structure, resulting in ice.
