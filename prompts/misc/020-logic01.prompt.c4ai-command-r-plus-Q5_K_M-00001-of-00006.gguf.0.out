<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>A theory that proves itself would typically be called "consistent" rather than "tautological." Consistency in logic refers to the absence of contradiction within a theory or system of axioms. That is, a consistent theory is one in which it is impossible to derive both a statement and its negation from the axioms of the theory.

Here's an example to illustrate this:

Let's consider the theory of algebra of sets, which includes axioms such as the associative and commutative laws for set union and intersection, the distributive laws, and the law of double complement. These axioms, taken together, form a consistent theory because they do not lead to contradictions. We cannot prove both a statement and its negation within this theory. The theory is consistent with itself, but it wouldn't be correct to call it tautological.

On the other hand, "tautological" is a term used to describe a statement that is true by definition or by the meaning of the words used, without providing any additional information. A tautology in propositional logic is a compound statement that is always true, regardless of the truth or falsity of its simple components.

For example, the statement "It will rain or it will not rain" is a tautology because it is true in either case. However, this isn't typically how we would describe a theory or a logical framework.

In summary, a theory that proves itself to be free of contradictions would be called "consistent," whereas "tautological" is a term used for statements that are true by definition, and it's not commonly applied to describe entire theories or frameworks.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>
