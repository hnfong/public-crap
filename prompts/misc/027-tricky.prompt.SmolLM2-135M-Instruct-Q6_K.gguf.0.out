A) Yes, water freezes at -12 degrees Celsius. This is because water molecules have a negative charge, which is attracted to the positive charge of the surrounding water molecules. When water freezes, it forms a solid, or ice, at a temperature of -12 degrees Celsius.

B) You have a glass of pure water. When you cool it down to -12 degrees Celsius, the water molecules will start to move more slowly, and the temperature will decrease. As a result, the water will freeze, forming a solid, or ice, at a temperature of -12 degrees Celsius. This is because the negative charge of the water molecules is attracted to the positive charge of the surrounding water molecules, causing the ice to form. [end of text]
