4: Take Britain, for example. They allow Silesia lawns to be imported for personal consumption, but prohibit French cambrics and lawns, even if they're meant for export. The UK also imposes higher duties on French wine, while being lenient towards Portugal.

10: When the exchange rate between two countries is at par, it's said to indicate a balance. But when a premium is paid for a bill, it means one country has to send money to the other.
