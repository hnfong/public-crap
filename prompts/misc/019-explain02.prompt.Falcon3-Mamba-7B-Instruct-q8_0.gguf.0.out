Sure, imagine you have a big club in China called the National People's Congress. This club is like a big meeting where lots of important people get together to talk about how to make their country better. They decide on new rules, like when to have a holiday or how to keep everyone safe. It's a bit like when you and your friends decide on a game to play or what snack to have. Just like you listen to your teacher or parents, people in China listen to what this big club says to help make their country a good place to live. Even though it's far away in China, what they decide can affect people everywhere, including in London. [end of text]
