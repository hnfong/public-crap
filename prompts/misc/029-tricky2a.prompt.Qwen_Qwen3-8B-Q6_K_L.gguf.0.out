Bob is not right. 

Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32째F). At -10 degrees Celsius, water is already frozen and exists as ice. So Alice is correct in stating that water freezes at 0째C, and Bob's statement that "it freezes" at -10째C is misleading because it implies the freezing process is happening at that temperature, which is not accurate. The correct explanation is that water at -10째C is already frozen. [end of text]
