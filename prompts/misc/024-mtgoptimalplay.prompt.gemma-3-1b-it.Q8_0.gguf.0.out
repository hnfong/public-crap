Okay, let’s break down this Magic duel between Alice and Bob.

**The Situation:**

* **Alice:** Has two 'Kindle' cards in her hand.
* **Bob:** Has an Orim (1/3 attack, 3 toughness) and a Samite Healer (Tap – prevents damage).
* **Orim's Threat:** Orim is a significant threat to Alice’s burn deck.
* **Mana Available:** Alice has sufficient mana to cast any spells.
* **Bob's Lands:**  Bob’s lands are tapped out.

**Optimal Play & Outcome**

The optimal play for both players is to **immediately play the 'Kindle' cards.**

**Thought Process:**

**Alice (Player 1):**

1. **Immediate Threat Assessment:** Alice’s 'Kindle' is a potent burn spell. It deals 2 damage to *any* target, and the damage is doubled by the number of 'Kindle' cards in all graveyards. This is a devastating effect, especially when combined with Bob’s Orim.
2. **Prioritize Damage:** Alice’s primary goal is to eliminate Orim.  The 'Kindle' is designed to do this efficiently.
3. **Consider Bob's Healer:** Bob’s Samite Healer is a valuable tool, but it’s a reactive defense. It doesn’t directly address the immediate threat of the 'Kindle'.  It’s better to deal with the immediate damage.
4. **Strategic Timing:**  Alice needs to act quickly.  The longer she waits, the more Orim can potentially survive and deal damage.

**Bob (Player 2):**

1. **Initial Assessment:** Bob’s Samite Healer is a strong defensive card, but it’s not a direct attacker. It’s a way to mitigate damage, but not a primary damage source.
2. **Understanding the Threat:** Bob’s Orim is a significant threat, but it’s a creature with a limited lifespan.  It’s not going to be immediately destroyed by a single 'Kindle' spell.
3. **Resource Management:** Bob’s primary concern is to survive the initial onslaught. He needs to protect his life total.
4. **Consider the 'Kindle'’s Impact:**  The 'Kindle' will likely deal a significant amount of damage to Orim, but it’s a slow burn.  Bob needs to be ready to respond to the damage.

**Outcome:**

Alice immediately plays two 'Kindle' cards.  The 'Kindle' deals 2 damage to *any* target, and the damage is doubled by the number of 'Kindle' cards in all graveyards.  This is a decisive and efficient way to eliminate Orim.

**Why this is the best play:**

* **Immediate Impact:** The 'Kindle' immediately deals damage, disrupting Orim’s potential to survive.
* **Efficiency:** It’s a straightforward, effective solution to the immediate threat.
* **Leverages the 'Kindle'’s Power:** The 'Kindle' is designed to be a powerful burn spell, and it’s the most effective way to deal with Orim.

**Important Considerations (Beyond the Rules):**

* **Mana Curve:** Alice’s mana is relatively strong, allowing her to cast the 'Kindle' quickly. Bob’s mana is limited, so he needs to be careful about his mana usage.
* **Graveyard Interaction:**  The 'Kindle'’s damage is amplified by the number of 'Kindle' cards in the graveyard.  This is a key strategic element.
