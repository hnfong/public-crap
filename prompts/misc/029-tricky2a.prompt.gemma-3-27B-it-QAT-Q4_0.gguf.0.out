Bob is right, surprisingly! 

While it's *true* water freezes at 0°C, it **can** and *will* freeze at -10°C (and colder temperatures). -10°C is below the freezing point, so water will be in a frozen state (ice) at that temperature. 

Bob's statement "It freezes" is a general truth – water *does* freeze at -10°C, even though Alice is correct about the *specific* temperature at which freezing *begins*. Alice focused on the *process* of freezing, while Bob focused on the *state* of the water.
