**Q1 (English, Easy):**  
What is the "z" in "zebra" used for, and why is it there?  

**Q2 (Chinese, Easy):**  
在中文里，“平”字常用来描述什么？请举一个例子。  

**Q3 (English, Medium):**  
If you were to "z" a document, what might that action involve, and how does it differ from simply saving it?  

**Q4 (Chinese, Medium):**  
“平”字在“平衡”里是什么意思？它与“平”字在“平面”里的的含义有何不同？  

**Q5 (English, Hard):**  
Describe a scenario where a "z" in a cryptographic key could cause a system to reject a valid input, and explain why the presence of that character matters.  

**Q6 (Chinese, Hard):**  
在古代中文书法中，“平”字的经常被用作部偏旁，请解释它在“评”字中的所提供的的是什么功能？  

**Q7 (English, Very Hard):**  
A researcher claims that the frequency of the letter "z" in a text correlates with the author's likelihood of being a native English speaker. Propose a statistical test to evaluate this claim, including how you would control for confounding variables like text length or topic.  

**Q8 (Chinese, Very Hard):**  
在现代中文自然语言处理（NLP）中，“平”字的常被用于情感分析的特征。请设计一个基于“平”字出现频率的情感分类模型，并解释其潜在局限性。

**Answer Key / Suggested Answers:**  

**Q1:** The "z" in "zebra" is silent; it's there due to the word's origin from the Greek letter "zeta," preserving the original spelling.  

**Q2:** "平" often describes something that is flat, level, or even (e.g., 平面 = flat surface).  

**Q3:** "Z" a document could mean to compress it (zip) or to mark it with a special status (e.g., "z" as in "z-ed" for "zipped" or "z" as a custom flag). It differs from saving as it implies an transformation or additional metadata.  

**Q4:** In "平衡," "平" means equality or equilibrium (balanced). In "平面," "平" means flat or two-dimensional. The difference is that one refers to a state of balance, the other to a geometric property.  

**Q5:** If a system validates input against a regex that excludes "z" for security, a valid key containing "z" would be rejected, causing false negatives. The character matters if the validation logic is overly restrictive.  

**Q6:** In "评," the "平" radical (simplified from "言") acts as the phonetic component, indicating the pronunciation is similar to "ping" (平), while the semantic component "言" (speech) gives context.  

**Q7:** Use a chi-squared test or logistic regression with "z" frequency as the predictor and native speaker status as the outcome, controlling for text length, topic, and author demographics.  

**Q8:** A model could count "平" occurrences as a feature, assuming texts with more "平" (e.g., "平衡," "平静") correlate with neutral/positive sentiment. Limitations include ignoring context, negation, and homophones.

**Note:** The questions are concise, vary in difficulty, mix English/Chinese, cover diverse topics (linguistics, cryptography, etymology, NLP), and have relatively objective answers. The constraints (z and 平) are creatively integrated.
