Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

model
Bob is technically right, but misleading.

Here's why:

*   **Bob is right:** Water *does* freeze at -10째C. It just takes longer than at 0째C. The freezing process starts well below 0째C, but it requires a certain amount of heat to be removed to complete the phase change.
*   **Alice is right in a common understanding:** People usually think of 0째C as the freezing point because that's when it readily and quickly freezes under standard conditions.



Essentially, Bob is highlighting a more nuanced scientific detail, while Alice is stating the more commonly known fact. [end of text]
