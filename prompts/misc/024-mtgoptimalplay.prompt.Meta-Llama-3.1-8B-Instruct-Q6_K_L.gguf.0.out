Let's break down the situation and the optimal play for both players.

**Alice's situation:**

Alice has two copies of Kindle in her hand, which is a powerful burn spell that can deal damage to any target. However, she needs to be careful because Orim, Samite Healer is a threat that can prevent damage from being dealt to it. Alice's goal is to kill Orim.

**Bob's situation:**

Bob has Orim, Samite Healer in play, which is a 1/3 creature with a powerful ability to prevent damage. Since Bob's lands are tapped out, he can't play any new spells or creatures. His goal is to protect Orim and prevent Alice from killing it.

**Optimal play for Alice:**

Alice's best play is to cast one of her Kindles, targeting Orim. Since Orim has the ability to prevent damage, Alice needs to make sure that the damage from the Kindle is not prevented. To do this, Alice will cast the Kindle as an instant, which means it will resolve before the beginning of the next combat phase.

When Alice casts the Kindle, she will deal 2 + 2 = 4 damage to Orim. However, since Orim has the ability to prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to it, the 3 damage will be prevented, leaving Orim with 1 damage remaining.

**Optimal play for Bob:**

Bob's best play is to use Orim's ability to prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to it. Since Alice's Kindle will deal 4 damage, Bob will use Orim's ability to prevent 3 of those 4 damage, leaving Orim with 1 damage remaining.

**Outcome:**

After the Kindle resolves, Orim will have 1 damage remaining. Since Orim's toughness is 3, it will survive the attack and remain on the battlefield. However, Alice will have one Kindle remaining in her hand, which she can use to finish off Orim on her next turn.

**Thought process:**

Alice's thought process is to use her Kindle to deal as much damage as possible to Orim, while also considering the potential for Orim's ability to prevent some of the damage. She chooses to cast the Kindle as an instant to ensure it resolves before the beginning of the next combat phase, when Orim's ability will be triggered.

Bob's thought process is to use Orim's ability to prevent as much damage as possible from the Kindle. He knows that Orim's ability can only prevent 3 damage, so he will use it to prevent 3 of the 4 damage from the Kindle, leaving Orim with 1 damage remaining. [end of text]
