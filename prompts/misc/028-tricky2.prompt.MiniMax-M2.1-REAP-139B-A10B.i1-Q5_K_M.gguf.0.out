Both are partially correct, but Bob’s statement is misleading. Water (H₂O) freezes at 0 °C, which is its normal freezing point. At –10 °C, water is already frozen and remains solid. So Alice is right that the freezing point is 0 °C, while Bob is wrong to say water “freezes at –10 °C”—it’s already frozen by then. Bob’s claim that he’s “still right” is incorrect. 

**Answer:** Alice is correct; water freezes at 0 °C, not –10 °C.
