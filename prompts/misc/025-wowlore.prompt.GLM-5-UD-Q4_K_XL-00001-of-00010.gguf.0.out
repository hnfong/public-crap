**M for Molten Core**
A 40-man raid instance located deep within Blackrock Mountain, ruled by the Firelord Ragnaros.

**N for Naxxramas**
Though added in the final patch (1.11) of Vanilla, this floating necropolis served as the final major raid instance, located above the Eastern Plaguelands.

**O for Orgrimmar**
The capital city of the Orcs, located in the valley of Durotar, named in honor of the orcish warchief Orgrim Doomhammer.

**P for Plaguelands**
Referring to the Eastern and Western Plaguelands in northern Lordaeron, territories ravaged by the undead Scourge.

**Q for Quel'Thalas**
While the playable zone (Eversong Woods) was added in *The Burning Crusade*, the kingdom of Quel'Thalas existed in lore on the map north of the Eastern Plaguelands, and the high elves were a prominent part of Vanilla lore.

**R for Razorfen Downs**
A dungeon located in the Barrens, the capital of the quilboar, built from huge thorns and brambles.

The grand human capital city located in Elwynn Forest, the last bastion of human power in the south.

**U for Un'Goro Crater**
A massive, prehistoric crater located in southern Kalimdor, filled with dinosaurs and devilsaurs.

**V for Vashj'ir**
*Correction:* While Vashj'ir was an expansion zone, a suitable Vanilla alternative is **Vale of Eternal Blossoms**? No, that is Pandaria. A better Vanilla fit is **Violet Citadel** (the seat of power in Dalaran) or simply **Venture Co.** (The Venture Company had operations in Stonetalon, Barrens, etc.). Let's go with **Violet Citadel**.
*Self-Correction for strict Vanilla:* **Violet Citadel**. While Dalaran was a bubble in the Alterac Mountains, the citadel was the central tower.
