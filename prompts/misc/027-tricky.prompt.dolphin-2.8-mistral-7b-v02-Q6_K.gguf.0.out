A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius (or 32 degrees Fahrenheit). At -12 degrees Celsius, water is still in its liquid state.

B) If you have a glass of pure water and cool it down to -12 degrees Celsius, the water will still be in its liquid state. It will not freeze until it reaches the freezing point of 0 degrees Celsius. However, you may notice that the water becomes colder and denser as it approaches the freezing point, and it may start to feel slightly thicker or heavier. [end of text]
