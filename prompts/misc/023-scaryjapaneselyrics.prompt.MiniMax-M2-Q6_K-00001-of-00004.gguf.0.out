### Interpretation

The song tells the story of a traveler who, after following a trail of acorns, arrives at a small restaurant in the forest. The place is empty, the traveler has no reservation, and the only menu item is “recommended.” The kitchen is playing a string quartet, and the birds are laughing. The owner welcomes the traveler, offers a full meal, and then puts them to sleep. When the traveler wakes up, the owner says goodbye and tells them to come back tomorrow, “and so on.”

The twist comes in the second half: the restaurant is bustling, with a hand‑reared bear dancing, and the menu lists dishes like carpaccio, paella, and risotto—but no desserts. The owner offers to deliver the meal “even to the inside of a grave,” and calls this “the last full course tonight.”

### A literal, fantastical reading

The restaurant is a liminal place that exists between life and death. It is a waystation for souls who have just died. The acorn trail is a path that leads the newly dead to this place. The restaurant is empty because the dead are not yet fully processed; the traveler has no reservation because death is unplanned. The only menu item is “recommended,” meaning the dead are offered the same fate: to be fed and then put to sleep. The birds laughing are the spirits of the dead or the forest’s own spirits, amused by the traveler’s confusion.

The second half shows the restaurant in full swing, with the dead’s “hand‑reared bear” (a familiar spirit or a guide) dancing. The menu lists earthly dishes, but there is no dessert, because the dead do not get to enjoy the sweetness of life again. The owner’s promise to deliver the meal “to the inside of a grave” is literal: the restaurant’s service extends to the realm of the dead, and the “last full course” is the final meal before the soul is fully laid to rest. The owner’s goodbye and “tomorrow, and so on” is a cyclical promise: the restaurant will always be there for the next traveler, and the cycle of death and rebirth (or the next life) will continue.

In short, the song is about a soul’s first stop after death, a place of transition where the dead are fed, put to sleep, and then sent on their way, with the promise that the process will repeat for others. [end of text]
