[INST] If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?
[/INST] 1. **Consistency**: A theory is consistent if it does not contain any contradictions. In other words, there is no statement in the theory such that both the statement and its negation can be proven.

2. **Tautological**: A statement is tautological if it is true by necessity or by virtue of its logical form. In the context of theories, if a theory proves itself in a trivial or circular manner, it might be considered tautological, but this term is more commonly applied to individual statements rather than entire theories.

### Examples:

#### Consistent Theories:
1. **Peano Arithmetic (PA)**: This is a first-order theory that formalizes the natural numbers and their properties. It is widely believed to be consistent, although this cannot be proven within the theory itself due to Gödel's incompleteness theorems.

2. **Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory (ZFC)**: This is a standard form of axiomatic set theory and is also believed to be consistent. Again, its consistency cannot be proven within the theory itself.

#### Tautological Statements:
1. **Logical Tautologies**: Statements like "It is raining or it is not raining" are tautologies because they are true by virtue of their logical form.

2. **Self-referential Statements**: A statement like "This statement is true" can be seen as tautological if it is interpreted in a way that it always affirms its own truth.

### Self-Proving Theories:
A theory that proves itself is often considered tautological in a broader sense, but this is not a standard term in formal logic or mathematics. Here are a couple of examples that might fit this description:

1. **Self-Verifying Systems**: Some formal systems can be designed to include axioms that assert their own consistency. For example, a system might include an axiom that states "This system is consistent." While this might seem tautological, it does not necessarily make the system consistent in a meaningful way.

2. **Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems**: These theorems show that any sufficiently strong formal system capable of expressing arithmetic cannot prove its own consistency. This implies that a theory that claims to prove its own consistency must either be inconsistent or not sufficiently strong to express arithmetic.

In summary, a theory that proves itself is not typically called "consistent" in the formal sense, as consistency is about the absence of contradictions. It might be considered tautological if the proof is trivial or circular, but this is not a standard term for theories. The examples provided illustrate the nuances of these concepts.
