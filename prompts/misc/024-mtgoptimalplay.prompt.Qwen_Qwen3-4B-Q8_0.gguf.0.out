Let's analyze the situation step by step, using **Magic: The Gathering** rules as of 2024.

---

## **Current Game State:**

- **Alice's Hand:** Two copies of **Kindle** (Instant).
- **Bob's Hand:** Empty.
- **Bob's Board:** One **Orim, Samite Healer** (untapped, 1/3, with the ability: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.")
- **Turn:** Alice's turn.
- **Orim has been on the board for a while**, so it is **untapped** and **not affected by summoning sickness**.
- **Alice has sufficient mana** to cast any spells.
- **Bob's lands are tapped out**, so he cannot play any new cards.

---

## **Objective:**

Alice wants to **kill Orim**, which is a threat to her burn deck. Bob has no cards in hand, so he cannot respond to Alice's plays directly.

---

## **Step-by-Step Analysis:**

### **1. What is the effect of Kindle?**

- **Kindle** is an **instant** that deals **X damage to any target**, where **X = 2 + the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards**.
- So, if Alice casts **one Kindle**, it deals **2 + 0 = 2 damage** (since no Kindles are in graveyards yet).
- If she casts **two Kindles**, the first one deals **2 damage**, and the second one deals **2 + 1 = 3 damage** (because one Kindle is now in the graveyard).

### **2. What is the effect of Orim?**

- **Orim, Samite Healer** has the ability: **"Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."**
- This is a **tap ability**, which means Bob can **tap Orim** to prevent **3 damage** from being dealt to any target this turn.
- Since Orim is **untapped**, Bob can choose to **tap it** to prevent **3 damage**.

---

## **Alice's Optimal Play:**

Alice has two Kindles in hand. She can cast both of them in her turn.

### **Option 1: Cast both Kindles in sequence.**

- **First Kindle:** Deals **2 damage** to Orim.
- **Second Kindle:** Deals **3 damage** to Orim (because one Kindle is now in the graveyard).

**Total damage to Orim:** 2 + 3 = **5 damage**.

But **Orim has the ability to prevent 3 damage**. So, if Bob taps Orim, he can prevent **3 damage**.

So, **if Bob taps Orim**, the damage becomes:

- 2 (from first Kindle) + 3 (from second Kindle) = **5 damage**, but **3 is prevented**, so **2 damage is dealt**.

So, **Orim would take 2 damage**.

But **Orim has 3 toughness**, so it would survive.

### **Option 2: Cast both Kindles at the same time.**

- Since both Kindles are cast in the same turn, they both deal damage **before** Orim has a chance to tap.

So, **Orim would take 2 + 3 = 5 damage**, and **Bob can tap Orim** to prevent **3 damage**, so **2 damage is dealt**.

Same result as above.

### **Conclusion:**

- **Orim would take 2 damage**.
- **Orim has 3 toughness**, so it would **survive**.

---

## **Bob's Optimal Play:**

Bob has no cards in hand, but he can **tap Orim** to prevent **3 damage**.

So, **Bob should tap Orim** to prevent **3 damage**.

This is the **optimal play** for Bob, as it reduces the damage from **5 to 2**, which is enough to **kill Orim**.

---

## **Final Outcome:**

- **Alice casts both Kindles**, dealing **5 damage** to Orim.
- **Bob taps Orim**, preventing **3 damage**.
- **Orim takes 2 damage**, and since it has **3 toughness**, it **survives**.

---

## **Conclusion:**

- **Alice cannot kill Orim** with her two Kindles in this turn.
- **Bob's optimal play is to tap Orim**, which prevents **3 damage**, allowing Orim to survive.
- **Alice needs to find a different way to kill Orim**, such as using a **creature with a +1/+1 counter** or a **spell that deals more damage**.

---

## **Summary:**

| Player | Action | Outcome |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Alice | Casts two Kindles | Deals 5 damage to Orim |
| Bob   | Taps Orim | Prevents 3 damage to Orim |
| Result | Orim takes 2 damage | Orim survives |

**Final Answer:** **Orim survives Alice's attack.** Alice needs to use a different strategy to kill Orim. [end of text]
