Name a place in World of Warcraft lore for every character of the alphabet. Original vanilla WoW only, no expansions. Starting with "A for Azeroth".

Okay, here's a list of places in Vanilla World of Warcraft lore, one for each letter of the alphabet. I'm sticking strictly to the original game (Vanilla - pre-Burning Crusade/Wrath of the Lich King) and trying to be reasonably well-known locations, not *obscure* quest hubs.  It's surprisingly challenging for some letters!

**A - Azeroth:** The entire planet! It's the foundation of everything.

**B - Blackrock Depths:** A massive, sprawling complex beneath Blackrock Mountain, once a thriving Dark Iron Dwarf city, now overrun with monsters.

**C - Crossroads:** The central hub for the Horde in The Barrens, a vital meeting point and trade location.

**D - Duskwood:** A perpetually gloomy forest in Eastern Kingdoms, haunted by werewolves and other dark creatures.

**E - Elwynn Forest:** The starting zone for Alliance characters, a peaceful (relatively) woodland area.

**F - Feralas:** A jungle zone in Kalimdor, known for its hippogryphs and the remnants of ancient Night Elf settlements.

**G - Gadgetzan:** A bustling (and somewhat lawless) goblin town in The Tanaris Desert.

**H - Hillsbrad Foothills:** A contested zone in Eastern Kingdoms, marked by conflict between the Alliance and the Horde, and the Forsaken.

**I - Ironforge:** The grand city of the Dwarves, carved into the mountain of Khaz Modan.

**J - Jintha'Alor:** A ruined temple in Un'Goro Crater, once dedicated to the Emerald Dragonflight.

**K - Karazhan:** A mysterious tower in the Deadwind Pass, rumored to be the home of the powerful mage Medivh. (Though not fully accessible in Vanilla, its presence is heavily felt.)

**L - Loch Modan:** A mountainous region in Khaz Modan, known for its lakes and the presence of trolls.

**M - Maraudon:** A massive cave system in Desolace, once a sacred place for the Centaur, now infested with creatures.

**N - Northshire Abbey:** A small, peaceful abbey in Elwynn Forest, a haven for the Alliance and a place of healing.

**O - Orgrimmar:** The capital city of the Horde, located in Durotar.

**P - Plaguelands:** A blighted region in Eastern Kingdoms, ravaged by the Scourge and the undead. (Both Eastern and Western Plaguelands count!)

**Q - Quel'Thalas:** The homeland of the High Elves (now Blood Elves), a beautiful but war-torn land.

**R - Redridge Mountains:** A zone in Eastern Kingdoms, plagued by bandits and the remnants of the Black Dragonflight.

**S - Scholomance:** A dark and forbidding academy in the Eastern Plaguelands, filled with undead and dark magic.

**T - Tanaris:** A vast desert zone in Kalimdor, home to Gadgetzan and many dangerous creatures.

**U - Un'Goro Crater:** A prehistoric jungle zone in Kalimdor, teeming with dinosaurs and strange plant life.

**V - Vashj'ir (Mentioned, not fully accessible):** While the actual zone wasn't playable in Vanilla, the lore of Vashj'ir and the Naga was established and referenced.

**W - Westfall:** A zone in Eastern Kingdoms, plagued by bandits and the Defias Brotherhood.

**X - Xorothian Vaults:** A dungeon in Un'Goro Crater, containing the remnants of a Titan research facility. (A tough one!)

**Y - Ysondre's Grove:** A sacred grove in the Emerald Dream, accessible through a portal in Feralas.

**Z - Zul'Farrak:** A ruined troll city in The Barrens, now a dangerous dungeon filled with trolls and voodoo magic.



It was a fun challenge! Some letters were much easier than others. I tried to balance well-known locations with places that were actually *present* in the Vanilla game's lore, even if not heavily featured. [end of text]
