**Why They Conflict:**

These events conflict because their scheduled start and end times overlap, meaning that participants cannot attend both events simultaneously. For instance, in Event A & Event C, attendees would need to be at two different places at the same time, which is not possible. Similarly, for Event P & Event R, participants would need to leave one event to attend the other, which is impractical. These conflicts highlight the importance of scheduling events with non-overlapping time slots to ensure that attendees can participate in all events they are interested in. [end of text]
