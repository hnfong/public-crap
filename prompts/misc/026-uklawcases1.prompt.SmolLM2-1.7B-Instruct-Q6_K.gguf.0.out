"R v Cunningham", "R v Caldwell", and "R v G" are three landmark cases in the history of English law that have had a significant impact on the development of criminal law and procedure in the United Kingdom. These cases, decided by the House of Lords in 1994, 1996, and 1998 respectively, addressed various aspects of criminal law, including the definition of a crime, the role of the jury, and the admissibility of evidence.

"R v Cunningham" (1994)

In "R v Cunningham", the House of Lords considered the question of whether the offence of "causing or attempting to cause a miscarriage of justice" was a crime within the meaning of the Offences Against the State Acts 1919 and 1922. The defendant, Cunningham, had been convicted of attempting to cause the miscarriage of justice by falsely imprisoning a man who was later acquitted. The House of Lords held that the offence was not a crime within the meaning of the Acts, as it did not involve a breach of the public trust or a serious interference with the administration of justice.

The significance of "R v Cunningham" lies in its clarification of the scope of the Offences Against the State Acts, which had been enacted to prevent miscarriages of justice. The case established that the Offences Against the State Acts did not apply to offences that did not involve a breach of the public trust or a serious interference with the administration of justice. This decision has had a lasting impact on the development of criminal law in the UK, as it has helped to clarify the boundaries between different types of offences and the scope of the Offences Against the State Acts.

"R v Caldwell" (1996)

The defendant, Caldwell, had been convicted of perverting the course of justice by attempting to intimidate a witness. The House of Lords held that the offence was a crime within the meaning of the Acts, as it involved a serious interference with the administration of justice.
