Alice is correct in stating that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius. At -10 degrees Celsius, water would be in a frozen state, but the specific temperature at which it transitions from liquid to solid is 0 degrees Celsius. Bob's statement that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius is incorrect, as it does not accurately reflect the freezing point of water. However, Bob's conclusion that he is still right might be based on a misunderstanding of the question or a different context not provided in the conversation. In the context of the given conversation, Alice is correct. [end of text]
