Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is right, despite Alice's correction. 

While it's *true* water freezes at 0°C, at -10°C water **is** frozen – it exists as ice. Bob stated the *state* of water at that temperature, which is correct. Alice focused on the *process* of freezing, and the temperature at which it *starts* to happen.

They are talking about different aspects of the same phenomenon.
