The lyrics paint a whimsical, surreal narrative that blends the mundane with the fantastical, creating a story that feels both grounded and otherworldly. Here's a possible interpretation:

### **Literal Interpretation: A Hidden Restaurant in the Forest**  
The song describes a mysterious, unmarked restaurant nestled in a forest, accessible only to those who follow a "dungri" (a faint, almost imperceptible trail). The restaurant is perpetually empty, with no reservations, yet it thrives as a bustling lunchtime spot. The "small bird" (a literal bird, perhaps a symbol of the forest's guardian) "pattapattar" (a sound like a heartbeat or a playful rhythm) in the background, adding to the eerie charm.  

The "red paint" on the roof and the "menu" (which only recommends "that one thing") suggest a place that is both decorative and enigmatic. The kitchen is alive with soundsâ€”violin, flute, and "bio" (possibly a typo for "bouillon" or a magical ingredient). The staff (a "child bear" and "carpaccio") are lively, dancing and serving "dessert" (a literal sweet treat) to guests.  

The restaurant is a liminal space, existing between the real and the surreal. It is a place where time is fluid: "Tomorrow is tomorrow" (a line that could mean the restaurant is eternal or that the guests are stuck in a loop). The "last course" of the night is a final, bittersweet experience, with the promise of "delivering to the grave" (a literal or metaphorical end).

### **Fantastical Setting**  
The restaurant is a hidden realm, perhaps a portal to a parallel world where the rules of reality bend. The "dungri" is a magical path that only the lost or the curious can follow, leading to a place that exists outside of time. The "small bird" might be a guardian spirit, while the "child bear" and "carpaccio" are enchanted beings. The "red paint" could be a magical substance that keeps the restaurant afloat, and the "menu" is a riddle that only the most adventurous can solve.  

The line "deliver to the grave" suggests the restaurant is a place where the dead are served, or where the living are lured into a cycle of eternal consumption. The "last course" is a final, irreversible experience, leaving guests with a lingering sense of wonder or regret.

### **Themes**  
- **The Allure of the Unknown**: The restaurant represents the temptation of the mysterious, a place that exists just beyond the edge of the ordinary.  
- **Eternity and Transience**: The line "Tomorrow is tomorrow" hints at a timeless, cyclical existence, where the restaurant is both eternal and fleeting.  
- **The Cost of Curiosity**: The "lost person" who follows the trail might be a metaphor for the seeker, but the restaurant's emptiness suggests that even the curious are not truly welcome.  

This interpretation leans into the literal, fantastical elements of the lyrics, framing the restaurant as a liminal space that defies logic but feels deeply rooted in the song's whimsical tone. [end of text]
