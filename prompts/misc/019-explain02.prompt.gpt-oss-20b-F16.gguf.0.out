That’s a bit like what the **National People’s Congress (NPC)** does in China, but instead of a school, it’s for the whole country.

- **Who is in it?**  
  The NPC is made up of many, many people (about 3,000) who are chosen from all over China. They’re like the class representatives in a school, but for the whole country.

- **What do they do?**  
  1. **Talk about rules** – They meet and discuss new laws or changes to existing ones, just like kids might decide on new rules for a game.  
  2. **Make decisions** – They vote on important matters, such as the budget (how money is spent) and big plans for the country.  
  3. **Check on the government** – They ask questions and make sure the people in charge (the government) are doing their jobs well, similar to how a class monitor might check that everyone is following the school rules.

- **When do they meet?**  
  They usually meet once a year for a few weeks, but they can also meet more often if something important comes up.

- **Why is it important?**  
  Because the NPC helps make sure that the country’s laws and plans are fair and that the people’s voices are heard, just like a school council helps make the school a better place for everyone.

So, the NPC is like a giant, very important school council that helps decide how China should run, making sure everyone’s ideas and needs are considered. Even though it’s far away in China, it works in a similar way to how the UK has Parliament to make decisions for the country. [end of text]
