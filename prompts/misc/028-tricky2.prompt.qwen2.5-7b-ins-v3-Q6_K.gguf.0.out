Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Alright, I need to determine who is right between Alice and Bob regarding the freezing point of water at -10 degrees Celsius. Let's start by recalling the basic properties of water. Water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. This is a fundamental fact in physics and chemistry.

Now, Alice states that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius, which contradicts the standard knowledge. Bob, on the other hand, claims that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius but insists that he is still right despite Alice's statement. This suggests that Bob might be misunderstanding or misremembering the freezing point of water.

Let me think about possible reasons for Alice's statement. Maybe she's confusing the freezing point with the boiling point of water, which is 100 degrees Celsius. Alternatively, she could be referring to a different substance that has a different freezing point. However, in the context of this conversation, it seems most likely that Alice is incorrect.

Could there be any conditions under which water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius? Well, freezing point depression is a colligative property that occurs when a solute is dissolved in a solvent. This lowers the freezing point of the solution. For example, adding salt to water lowers its freezing point below 0 degrees Celsius. However, this is a change in the freezing point due to impurities, not the natural freezing point of pure water.

Another angle to consider is the pressure. The freezing point of water is dependent on pressure. At standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere), water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius. If the pressure were increased, the freezing point would actually rise slightly above 0 degrees Celsius. Conversely, if the pressure were decreased, the freezing point would drop below 0 degrees Celsius. But in this scenario, there's no mention of pressure changes, so this might not be relevant.

Let me also think about the context in which Alice and Bob are discussing this. If they're in a scientific setting or discussing specific conditions, there might be nuances that affect the freezing point. However, without additional information, it's reasonable to assume standard conditions.

Reflecting on all these points, it seems that Alice's statement is incorrect based on standard scientific knowledge. Bob, while insisting he's right, is actually aligning with the correct freezing point of water under standard conditions.

But wait, could there be any exceptions or special cases where water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius? Perhaps in certain experimental setups or under specific conditions like extremely high purity or impurity-induced effects. However, these are not typical or standard scenarios and would require specific circumstances not mentioned in the conversation.

In conclusion, considering the standard freezing point of water and the lack of any special conditions mentioned, Alice is wrong, and Bob is right.
