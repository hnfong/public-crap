The command you've provided is a series of Linux commands that will process the text in the file `wowfanfic.txt`. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

1. `cat wowfanfic.txt`: This command reads the contents of the file `wowfanfic.txt` and outputs it to the standard output (stdout).

2. `perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'`: This Perl one-liner takes the input from the previous command (the contents of `wowfanfic.txt`), splits it into words based on whitespace (`\s`), and then prints each word on a new line. The `-n` option tells Perl to loop over the input, and the `-e` option allows you to provide the Perl code to execute.

3. `sort`: This command sorts the output from the previous command (the list of words) in alphabetical order.

4. `uniq -c`: This command counts the number of occurrences of each unique word in the sorted list. The `-c` option tells `uniq` to prefix each line of output with the number of occurrences.

5. `sort -n`: This command sorts the output from the previous command (the list of words with their counts) numerically based on the count.

6. `tail -n 20`: This command outputs the last 20 lines of the sorted list, which will be the 20 most frequently occurring words in the file `wowfanfic.txt`.

The probable output of this command will be a list of the 20 most frequently occurring words in the file `wowfanfic.txt`, along with their counts. The words will be sorted in ascending order of their frequency.

In terms of basic linguistic principles, this output will give you an idea of the most common words used in the fan fiction. This can be useful for understanding the overall theme or subject matter of the text, as well as for identifying any potential issues with word choice or repetition. [end of text]
