B for Blackrock Depths - A dungeon beneath Blackrock Mountain, home to the Blackrock Clan.
C for Coldarra - Not in vanilla WoW, but for the sake of the alphabet, we can use Coldarra from later expansions. However, since we're sticking to vanilla, let's use Coldridge Valley - a region in the Eastern Plaguelands.

L for Loch Modan - A region in Khaz Modan, home to the Ironforge dwarves.
M for Moonglade - The sacred forest of the night elves, located in northern Kalimdor.

O for Orgrimmar - The capital of the orcs, located in the Barrens.
P for Plaguelands - The Eastern and Western Plaguelands, regions in the Eastern Kingdoms affected by the Scourge.

Y for Yojamba Isle - Not in vanilla WoW, but for the sake of the alphabet, we can use Yojamba Isle from later expansions. However, since we're sticking to vanilla, let's use Western Plaguelands again, as it's the closest we can get.
Z for Zul'Farrak - A desert dungeon in Tanaris, home to the Zul'Farrak cultists.

Please note that some letters had to be creatively assigned due to the limited number of locations in vanilla WoW. [end of text]
