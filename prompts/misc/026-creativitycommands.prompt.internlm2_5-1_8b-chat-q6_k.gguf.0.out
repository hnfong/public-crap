I have written a fan fiction based on World of Warcraft characters. I saved the file into wowfanfic.txt

What is a probable output if I run this Linux command?

$ cat wowfanfic.txt | perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }' | sort |  uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 20

Explain your answer with respect to basic linguistic principles.

The output of the given Linux command is a list of the top 20 most common words in the file `wowfanfic.txt`. Here's a breakdown of the output:

1. The command starts by reading the contents of `wowfanfic.txt` and storing them in the variable `a`.
2. It then iterates over each element in the array `a` using a `foreach` loop.
3. For each element in the array, it prints the character `$_` (which represents the current element in the loop) followed by a newline character.
4. After printing all the characters, the command uses `sort` to sort the output alphabetically.
5. The `uniq -c` command is then used to remove duplicate lines and count the occurrences of each word.
6. Finally, `sort -n` sorts the output numerically, and `tail -n 20` selects the top 20 lines from the sorted output.

The output is a list of the most common words in the file, sorted by their frequency. The words are printed in alphabetical order, and the frequency of each word is also displayed. [end of text]
