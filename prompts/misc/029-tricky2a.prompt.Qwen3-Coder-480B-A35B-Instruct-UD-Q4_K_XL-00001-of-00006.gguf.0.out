Alice is right.

Water freezes at 0°C (32°F) under normal atmospheric pressure. At -10°C, water would already be frozen - it's 10 degrees below the freezing point. Bob's statement is incorrect because he's confusing the freezing point with a temperature that's already below freezing.

Alice correctly identifies that water freezes at 0°C, not -10°C. [end of text]
