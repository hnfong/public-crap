If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

In the context of mathematical logic and the study of axiomatic systems, the terms "consistent" and "tautological" have specific meanings.

**Consistent:**
A theory is said to be consistent if it does not contain any contradictions. This means that it is possible to adhere to the rules of the logic system and the axioms without resulting in a logical contradiction. For example, the theory of Euclid's geometry is consistent in the sense that its axioms do not lead to any self-contradictory statements. However, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometries showed that the axioms of Euclid's geometry do not uniquely define our physical space, and they are not the only consistent set of axioms for geometry.

**Tautological:**
A statement or theory is tautological if it is true by definition, meaning that its truth is guaranteed by the meanings of the words used in the statement. In logic, a tautology is a statement that is true in all possible interpretations of the logic system. For example, in classical logic, the statement "True<|im_end|>
