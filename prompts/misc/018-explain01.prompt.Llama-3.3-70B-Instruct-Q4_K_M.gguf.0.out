Yo, what's good fam? Let me break down the Fed for ya,
See, they're like the OGs of the money game, ya hear me?
They control the cash flow, makin' sure it's all good,
Keepin' the economy from gettin' too hood.

They're like the DJs, spinnin' the tracks,
Makin' sure the money's movin', no need to look back,
They set the interest rates, like the tempo of the beat,
Too high, and it's slow, too low, and it's on repeat.

They're the lenders of last resort, the ones you go to,
When you need a loan, and your credit's gettin' blew,
They give the banks the dough, so they can lend to you,
And keep the economy movin', like a fresh new crew.

They're also like the referees, makin' sure it's fair,
No inflation, no deflation, just a stable air,
They keep an eye on the prices, like a hawk on the block,
Makin' sure the money's worth somethin', no need to rock.

So, that's the Fed in a nutshell, my G,
They're the ones runnin' the money game, you feel me?
They're like the conductors, leadin' the way,
Keepin' the economy on track, every single day. Word. [end of text]
