Alice is right. Water freezes at 0 degrees celsius, not at -10 degrees celsius. Bob's statement is incorrect. However, Bob could argue that he is right if he meant that water is already frozen at -10 degrees celsius, as it would have already transitioned from liquid to solid state below 0 degrees celsius. But the original statement that water freezes at -10 degrees celsius is incorrect. [end of text]
