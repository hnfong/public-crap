 Based on the lyrics, here's a fantastical interpretation of the story they tell:

The song is about a small, mysterious restaurant hidden deep in the forest that no one can find by following acorns (ドングリを辿っても着きません). The restaurant is empty, with no reservations, and birds laugh during lunchtime (空席だらけのランチ時、小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる). It has a red tin roof and the menu is decided by the chef's recommendation (真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根、メニューはおすすめ そればかり).

The restaurant is enchanted, and the music of violins, flutes, cellos, and violas can be heard coming from the kitchen (厨房の方から聞こえてる バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ). Guests are welcomed warmly and invited to eat until they're full and fall asleep (ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい、たらふく食べたらお眠りよ).

The restaurant is a chaotic wonderland where baby bears dance, and various dishes like carpaccio, paella, hors d'oeuvres, and risotto are served, but there's no dessert (右から左へおおわらわ、手乗りの子熊も踊り出す、カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル リゾット デザートはありません).

The final verse hints at a darker twist, suggesting that the meal might be the last for the guests, as the course will be delivered to their graves (お墓の中まで届けましょう、今宵は最後のフルコース). This could imply that the guests are trapped in the enchanted restaurant forever, or that the food is poisoned.

In essence, the lyrics tell a whimsical yet slightly sinister tale of a hidden forest restaurant that serves a magical, albeit potentially dangerous, dining experience. [end of text]
