<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer: Who is right? Explanation: At -10°C, water is below freezing point, so it will freeze (solidify). But water freezes at 0°C under normal conditions. So Bob is right that water freezes at -10°C (it will be ice). Alice is partially right: water freezes at 0°C, but at -10°C it's already frozen. So Bob is correct in context. Provide brief explanation.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Bob is right.**  

- **Water’s freezing point** is 0 °C (under standard pressure).  
- Once the temperature drops below that, the liquid turns into ice.  
- At –10 °C the water is already well below its freezing point, so it will be solid ice.  

Alice is correct about the freezing point itself, but at –10 °C the water has already frozen. Thus Bob’s statement that “it freezes” at –10 °C is the accurate one in this context. [end of text]
