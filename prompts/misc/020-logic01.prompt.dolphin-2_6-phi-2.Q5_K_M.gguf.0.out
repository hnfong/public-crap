If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

When a theory proves itself, it is not called "consistent" or "tautological" directly. However, the concepts of consistency and tautology are related to the properties of a theory.

A theory is considered consistent if, given its axioms, it can lead to all true conclusions. In other words, a consistent theory does not contain any logical contradictions. A tautological theory, on the other hand, is a theory that is true by definition, or that makes every statement it contains true by its own logical rules.

Let's look at some examples:

1. An example of a tautological theory is the Peano axioms for arithmetic, which state that every natural number has the following properties:

   - Zero is the smallest natural number.
   - If a natural number is the sum of two other natural numbers, then it must be one of them.
   - If a natural number is the product of two other natural numbers, then it must be one of them.
   - If a natural number is the sum of the two smallest natural numbers, then it must be one of them.

These axioms are tautological because they make every statement they contain true by their own logical rules.

2. An example of a consistent but not tautological theory is the standard set theory of Zermelo-Fraenkel (ZF). ZF set theory has a set of axioms for the natural numbers, but it does not make every statement it contains true by its own logical rules. For example, ZF axiom 5 states that for every natural number n, there exists a natural number m such that n = m. However, this statement is not true by its own logical rules, as there are counterexamples like n = 2 and m = 2.

In conclusion, a theory that proves itself is not called "consistent" or "tautological" directly, but the concepts of consistency and tautology are related to the properties of a theory. A consistent theory does not contain any logical contradictions, while a tautological theory makes every statement it contains true by its own logical rules.
