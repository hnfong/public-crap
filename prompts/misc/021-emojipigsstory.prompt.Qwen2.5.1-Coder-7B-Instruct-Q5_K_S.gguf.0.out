Three little pigs, 🐷🐷🐷
Built houses of straw, 🍃🍃🍃
But the big bad wolf, 🐺
Came and blew them down, 💨💨💨

🏠🏠🏠
Next, they built with sticks, 🌲Twig Twig Twig
But the wolf came again, 🐺
And blew them down, 💨💨💨

🏠🏠🏠
Finally, they built with bricks, 🧱Brick Brick Brick
The wolf couldn't blow them down, 💨💨💨
The pigs were safe, 🐷🐷🐷
And the wolf had to go, 🐺

🏠🏠🏠
The three little pigs lived happily ever after, 🎉🎉🎉
With their strong brick house, 🧱
They were safe from the big bad wolf, 🐺
And they all lived happily ever after, 🎉🎉🎉 [end of text]
