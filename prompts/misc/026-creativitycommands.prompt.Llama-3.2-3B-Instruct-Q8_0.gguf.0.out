Let's break down the command and its output step by step.

1. `cat wowfanfic.txt`: This command reads the contents of the file `wowfanfic.txt` and displays it on the screen. The `cat` command is a simple text viewer that displays the contents of a file.

2. `perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/);`: This is a Perl one-liner that reads the input from the previous command (the output of `cat wowfanfic.txt`) and performs the following operations:
   - `@a = split(/\s/);`: This line splits the input into an array `@a` using whitespace (`\s`) as the delimiter. This means that each word in the input will be treated as a separate element in the array. The `\s` is a special character in Perl that matches any whitespace character (including spaces, tabs, and newline characters).

3. `foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }`: This loop iterates over each element in the array `@a` and prints it followed by a newline character (`\n`). The `foreach` loop is a Perl construct that allows you to iterate over a list of values.

4. `| sort`: This pipe (`|`) is a redirection operator that passes the output of the previous command as input to the next command. In this case, it passes the output of the previous Perl one-liner to the `sort` command.

5. `uniq -c`: This command counts the number of occurrences of each line in the input. The `-c` option tells `uniq` to count the occurrences of each line.

6. `sort -n`: This command sorts the output of the previous command in numerical order. The `-n` option tells `sort` to sort numerically.

7. `tail -n 20`: This command displays the last 20 lines of the output of the previous command.

Now, let's consider what this command does to your fan fiction text.

Assuming your `wowfanfic.txt` contains the following text:

```
This is the first line.
This is the second line.
This is the third line.
This is the fourth line.
This is the fifth line.
This is the sixth line.
This is the seventh line.
This is the eighth line.
This is the ninth line.
This is the tenth line.
This is the eleventh line.
This is the twelfth line.
This is the thirteenth line.
This is the fourteenth line.
This is the fifteenth line.
This is the sixteenth line.
This is the seventeenth line.
This is the eighteenth line.
This is the nineteenth line.
This is the twentieth line.
```

The command will output:

```
1 This is the first line.
1 This is the second line.
1 This is the third line.
1 This is the fourth line.
1 This is the fifth line.
1 This is the sixth line.
1 This is the seventh line.
1 This is the eighth line.
1 This is the ninth line.
1 This is the tenth line.
1 This is the eleventh line.
1 This is the twelfth line.
1 This is the thirteenth line.
1 This is the fourteenth line.
1 This is the fifteenth line.
1 This is the sixteenth line.
1 This is the seventeenth line.
1 This is the eighteenth line.
1 This is the nineteenth line.
1 This is the twentieth line.
```

As you can see, the command has sorted the lines in numerical order and counted the occurrences of each line. The `uniq -c` command has removed duplicates, so each line appears only once. The `sort -n` command has sorted the lines numerically, and the `tail -n 20` command has displayed the last 20 lines.

In summary, the command has sorted the lines in numerical order, counted the occurrences of each line, and displayed the last 20 lines of the output. [end of text]
