Okay, let's see. Alice and Bob are arguing about when water freezes. Alice says water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, which I remember is the standard freezing point. Bob claims it freezes at -10, but then Alice corrects him, and Bob says he's still right.

Wait, maybe Bob is thinking about supercooled water? Sometimes water can go below 0 without freezing if it's pure and undisturbed. But normally, at standard pressure, water freezes at 0°C. So under normal conditions, Alice is correct. But Bob might be referring to a specific scenario where water is supercooled. However, the question is about what happens at -10°C. If the water is already frozen, then at -10 it's ice, but the freezing process happens at 0. Hmm.

Wait, Bob said "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius." But freezing point is 0°C. So if the temperature is -10, the water would have already frozen. So Bob's statement is incorrect because the freezing occurs at 0, not at -10. Unless he's saying that at -10, water is frozen, which is true, but the act of freezing happens at 0. So maybe Bob is conflating the freezing point with the state at a lower temperature.

Alice says water freezes at 0, which is correct. Bob says he's still right, maybe thinking that at -10, water is frozen, so his statement that "water freezes at -10" is true. But actually, the freezing happens at 0; at -10 it's already frozen. So Bob's initial statement is wrong because the temperature at which freezing occurs is 0, not -10. Therefore, Alice is right, Bob is wrong. But Bob might be confused between the freezing point and the temperature where it remains frozen.

Wait, the question is "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" So at -10°C, liquid water would freeze, but only if it's cooled to that temp. Wait no—if you cool water to -10°C, it should have frozen at 0°C already. Unless it's supercooled. But under normal conditions, water freezes at 0°C, so at -10°C, it's ice. So Bob says "Water freezes at -10", which is incorrect because freezing happens at 0. Alice corrects him, and Bob insists he's right. Maybe Bob is thinking that since at -10 it's frozen, then it freezes at that temp, but that's not accurate. The phase change occurs at 0°C. So Alice is correct. Bob is wrong because the freezing point is 0°C, not -10. So the answer is Alice is right.

Alice is correct. Water freezes at **0°C** under standard atmospheric pressure, which is the defined freezing point. At **-10°C**, water is already frozen (as ice), but the **phase change** from liquid to solid occurs at 0°C. Bob’s statement confuses the **freezing point** (0°C) with the **temperature at which ice remains solid** (-10°C). While ice *exists* at -10°C, it does not *freeze* at that temperature. Thus, Alice’s correction is accurate, and Bob’s claim ("I’m still right") is incorrect. 

**Answer:** Alice is right. Water freezes at 0°C, not -10°C. At -10°C, water is already frozen. [end of text]
