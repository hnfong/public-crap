**Alice's Optimal Play:**

Alice's goal is to eliminate Orim, Samite Healer from the battlefield because it can prevent a significant amount of damage. Here's how she can achieve this:

1. **Cast the First Kindle:** Alice starts by casting one of her Kindles, targeting Orim. Since there is currently only one Kindle in any graveyard, the damage dealt will be 2 + 1 (from the first Kindle in the graveyard) = 3 damage.

2. **Resolve the First Kindle:** After casting the first Kindle, it resolves, dealing 3 damage to Orim. Orim's ability to prevent 3 damage is not yet activated, so the 3 damage is not prevented. Orim is dealt 3 damage and is destroyed (since it only has 3 toughness).

3. **Orim's Ability is Wasted:** Since Orim is destroyed before its ability can be activated (as abilities on the stack resolve before state-based actions like destruction for lethal damage), Bob cannot use Orim's ability to prevent the damage.

**Bob's Reaction:**

Bob has no cards in hand and his lands are tapped out, so he cannot react to Alice's play. His only asset, Orim, is destroyed before he can tap it to prevent damage.

**Outcome:**

Orim, Samite Healer is destroyed, and Alice successfully removes the threat from the board. The key here is understanding the order of operations in Magic: The Gathering. Abilities like Orim's must be activated before damage is dealt and resolved, but since the damage from the first Kindle is enough to destroy Orim outright, Bob cannot activate Orim's ability in response.

**Thought Process:**

* **Alice:** Alice understands that she needs to deal enough damage to kill Orim before Bob can use its ability. She calculates that one Kindle will be sufficient to deal lethal damage to Orim, given that the damage calculation includes the Kindle in the graveyard.
* **Bob:** Bob realizes that he cannot prevent the damage in time because Orim will be destroyed before he can tap it to activate its ability. His only hope would have been to have Orim on the battlefield with more than 3 toughness or to have had an instant or activated ability that could have prevented or redirected the damage, but he has neither.

**Game Mechanics Reference:**

- **State-Based Actions:** These are checked after every spell or ability resolves. Lethal damage causing a creature's toughness to drop to 0 or below is a state-based action that happens after the damage is dealt and not preventable by Orim's ability if Orim is already dead.
- **Stack and Resolution:** Spells and abilities are placed on the stack and resolve one at a time. Orim's ability to prevent damage would have to be activated before Kindle resolves, but since Kindle deals enough damage to destroy Orim outright, Bob cannot activate Orim's ability in response.

In summary, Alice's optimal play is to cast one Kindle, dealing 3 damage to Orim, which destroys it before Bob can use Orim's ability to prevent the damage. This play showcases the importance of timing and understanding the game's stack and state-based actions. [end of text]
