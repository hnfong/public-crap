The command you've written is a pipeline of several Unix/Linux commands that process the contents of `wowfanfic.txt`. Let's break down each part of the command and understand its purpose:

1. `cat wowfanfic.txt`: This command reads the contents of the file `wowfanfic.txt` and outputs it to the standard output (stdout).

2. `| perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'`: This part uses Perl to process the output from `cat`. The `-n` option tells Perl to print each line, and the `-e` option allows you to provide a script to run. The script splits each line into an array `@a` using whitespace as the delimiter, then prints each element of the array followed by a newline.

3. `| sort`: This command sorts the output from the previous step alphabetically.

4. `| uniq -c`: This command counts the occurrences of each unique line in the sorted output and prefixes each line with the count.

5. `| sort -n`: This command sorts the output from `uniq -c` numerically, which means it will sort the lines based on the counts.

6. `| tail -n 20`: This command outputs the last 20 lines of the sorted output.

Given that `wowfanfic.txt` contains a fan fiction based on World of Warcraft characters, the output will be a list of unique lines from the fan fiction, sorted by their frequency of occurrence, and limited to the last 20 lines.

The probable output will be a list of unique lines from the fan fiction, each prefixed with a count indicating how many times that line appears in the text. The lines will be sorted by their frequency, and only the last 20 lines will be displayed.

For example, if the fan fiction contains lines like:
```
Aragorn is a brave warrior.
Legolas is an elven archer.
Aragorn is a brave warrior.
Gimli is a dwarf warrior.
Legolas is an elven archer.
```

The output might look something like this:
```
1 Aragorn is a brave warrior.
1 Legolas is an elven archer.
1 Gimli is a dwarf warrior.
```

This output shows that each unique line appears only once, and since there are only three unique lines, the last 20 lines are not displayed. If there were more unique lines, the output would include the last 20 lines sorted by their frequency. [end of text]
