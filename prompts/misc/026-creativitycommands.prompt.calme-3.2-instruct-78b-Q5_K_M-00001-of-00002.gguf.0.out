The given command processes the text in a way that will likely output the 20 least frequently used words in "wowfanfic.txt". Here's a breakdown of the command:

1. `cat wowfanfic.txt`: This command reads the content of the file "wowfanfic.txt".

2. `perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'`: This Perl command splits the input (from the previous command) into words (by whitespace) and prints each word on a new line. This step is essentially tokenizing the text into individual words.

3. `sort`: This command sorts the output alphabetically. This is a necessary step for the next command to work properly.

4. `uniq -c`: This command counts the occurrences of each word. It groups consecutive identical lines and prepends the count of occurrences to each group. The output will be in the format of "count word", where "count" is the number of occurrences and "word" is the word itself.

5. `sort -n`: This command sorts the output numerically. It's crucial for sorting by the count (which is a number) to find the least frequent words.

6. `tail -n 20`: This command outputs the last 20 lines of the sorted output. Since the previous command sorted the output by the number of occurrences in ascending order, this command will output the 20 least frequently used words.

However, due to basic linguistic principles, the 20 least frequently used words are likely to be either very rare words, proper nouns, or words with very specific contexts in the text. In a fan fiction context, these could be unique character names, specific locations, or unique terms from the World of Warcraft universe. It's also possible that some of these words could be errors or non-words if the text wasn't perfectly formatted. 

In a typical text, the most frequent words are usually common function words (articles, prepositions, conjunctions, etc.) due to their high frequency in any given sentence, while the least frequent words are often content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) that are specific to the context of the text. 

In this case, since the command is looking for the least frequent words, it's unlikely that common function words would appear in the output. Instead, it would be more likely to see words that are unique to the story or the World of Warcraft universe. 

It's important to note that the command does not differentiate between different forms of the same word (e.g., "run", "running", "ran") or between words in different cases (e.g., "World" and "world"). This could lead to some words appearing more frequently than they would if the text was lemmatized or case-normalized. 

In a practical scenario, the output might not be strictly the 20 least frequent words due to these factors, but it would still give a good indication of words that are less common in the text. [end of text]
