Okay, the user is asking two related questions about water freezing at -12Â°C. Let me break this down carefully.

First question is straightforward: "Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?" Hmm, I recall pure water freezes at 0Â°C under standard conditions. So at -12Â°C, which is below freezing point, water should definitely be frozen. But I should mention this assumes normal atmospheric pressure and no impurities.

Second question is more interesting: "I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?" Here's where it gets tricky. Pure water can actually supercool below 0Â°C without freezing if there are no nucleation sites. But -12Â°C is quite far below freezing point - in reality, it would almost certainly freeze. I should explain both possibilities: the theoretical supercooling scenario versus what actually happens in a typical glass.

The user seems to want brief explanations, so I'll keep it concise but accurate. They might be a student studying phase changes, or just someone curious about everyday science. The mention of "pure water" suggests they might be testing if I know about supercooling. 

I should clarify that while supercooling is possible in lab conditions, in a regular glass with imperfections, it'll freeze solid at -12Â°C. Better mention both cases but emphasize the practical outcome. Also need to specify it becomes ice - not just "freezes" but changes state to solid.

For the first answer: simple yes with freezing point reference. For the second: explain the cooling process, possible supercooling but near-certain freezing at that temperature, resulting in solid ice. Must keep explanations brief as requested.

### A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?  
**Yes.**  
Pure water freezes at **0Â°C** under standard atmospheric pressure. At **-12Â°C** (well below 0Â°C), water is **solid ice**. Freezing occurs *at or below* 0Â°C, so -12Â°C is firmly in the frozen state.  

### B) What happens if pure water is cooled to -12Â°C?  
**It freezes into solid ice.**  
- Pure water *can* temporarily supercool below 0Â°C without freezing (if undisturbed and free of impurities/nucleation sites).  
- However, at **-12Â°C**, supercooling is **highly unstable**. Even minor disturbances (e.g., vibrations, dust) will trigger rapid freezing.  
- In a typical glass (with imperfections or dissolved gases), the water **will freeze solid** long before reaching -12Â°C. At -12Â°C, it is **definitively ice**.  

> ðŸ’¡ **Key note**: Supercooling is rare in everyday conditions. At -12Â°C, ice formation is inevitable. [end of text]
