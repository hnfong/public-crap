The lyrics of this Japanese song paint a whimsical and fantastical scene, set in a small restaurant in the forest. Here's a literal interpretation of the story the lyrics tell:

1. **The Forest Restaurant**: The song begins by describing a small restaurant located deep in the forest, which can only be reached by following an acorn trail. This restaurant is unique, as it has no reservations and is always empty during lunch time, with only birds chirping and laughing.

2. **The Restaurant's Atmosphere**: The restaurant has a red tin roof and offers a recommended menu. From the kitchen, one can hear the sounds of a string quartet playing violin, flute, cello, and viola, adding to the enchanting atmosphere.

3. **The Welcome**: The restaurant welcomes guests warmly, inviting them to eat to their heart's content and then take a nap. After that, they bid farewell, saying that tomorrow is another day.

4. **The Meal**: The meal served at the restaurant is a full course, including carpaccio, paella, risotto, and no dessert. The song humorously suggests that the meal is so good that it can be delivered even to the grave.

5. **The Dancing Bear Cub**: In the midst of the meal, a small bear cub starts dancing, adding to the lively and mischievous atmosphere of the restaurant.

In a fantastical setting, this song could be interpreted as a story about a magical forest restaurant that caters to various woodland creatures and perhaps even humans who stumble upon it. The restaurant offers a unique dining experience, complete with live music and a dancing bear cub, making it a memorable and enchanting place to visit. The song's lighthearted and slightly mischievous melody complements the whimsical nature of the story. [end of text]
