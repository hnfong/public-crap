Answer the following questions with brief explanations.

A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?
B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?
 [/INST] A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. Pure water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure.

B) If you cool down a glass of pure water to -12 degrees Celsius, it will not freeze immediately. However, it will become significantly colder and more viscous. The reason it does not freeze at this temperature is that the freezing point of water decreases as pressure increases, and the pressure inside a container of liquid water is higher than the atmospheric pressure due to the cohesive force between water molecules. This phenomenon is called supercooling. Eventually, if the temperature is kept low enough and the water is undisturbed, it may freeze spontaneously, or a small seed crystal can be introduced to initiate the freezing process.
