Imagine your school has a big meeting every year where all the grown-ups who help run the school get together. They talk about things like what new toys to buy, what rules to have, and how to make the school even better.

China has something like that too! It's called the National People's Congress. It's a big meeting where lots of grown-ups from all over China get together to talk about how to make China a better place. They decide on important things like building new roads, helping people who need it, and making sure everyone is safe and happy.

Just like your school meeting helps make your school better, the National People's Congress helps make China a better place for everyone who lives there.
