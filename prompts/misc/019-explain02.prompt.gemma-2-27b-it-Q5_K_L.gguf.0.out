Imagine your school has a big meeting every year where all the grown-ups who help run the school get together. They talk about important things like what new toys to buy, what rules to have, and how to make the school even better.

China has something similar called the National People's Congress. It's like a big meeting for all the grown-ups who help run China. They talk about important things for the whole country, like building new roads, helping people get jobs, and making sure everyone is safe and happy.

Just like your school meeting helps make your school a better place, the National People's Congress helps make China a better place for everyone who lives there. [end of text]
