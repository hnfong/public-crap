To understand the output of the command you provided, let's break it down step by step, using basic linguistic principles of text processing and command-line utilities.

---

### Command Breakdown:
1. **`cat wowfanfic.txt`**:
   - This reads the entire content of the file `wowfanfic.txt` and outputs it to standard output.

2. **`| perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "
"; }'`**:
   - The `perl` command processes the input line by line.
   - `split(/\s/)` splits each line into an array of words, using whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) as the delimiter.
   - `foreach (@a) { print $_ . "
"; }` iterates over the array of words and prints each word on a new line.
   - The result is a plain text file where all words from the original file are on separate lines, with no extra spaces or formatting.

3. **`| sort`**:
   - The `sort` command sorts the words alphabetically. This step ensures that the words are in a consistent order for further processing.

4. **`| uniq -c`**:
   - The `uniq -c` command counts the occurrences of each unique word and outputs the count followed by the word. For example, if the word "foo" appears 3 times, it will output `3 foo`.

5. **`| sort -n`**:
   - The `sort -n` command sorts the output by the numerical value (the count) in ascending order. This ensures that words with fewer occurrences appear first.

6. **`| tail -n 20`**:
   - The `tail -n 20` command outputs the last 20 lines of the input. Since the previous step sorted by count, this will show the 20 most frequent words, with their counts.

---

### Probable Output:
The final output of the command will be a list of the 20 most frequent words from the `wowfanfic.txt` file, sorted by their frequency in ascending order. Each line will display the count of a word followed by the word itself. For example:

```
1 apple
1 banana
2 cherry
3 dog
...
```

### Explanation Using Linguistic Principles:
1. **Tokenization**:
   - The `split(/\s/)` function acts as a tokenizer, breaking the input text into individual words (tokens) based on whitespace.

2. **Normalization**:
   - The `sort` and `uniq` commands normalize the text by ensuring consistency in word order and removing duplicates.

3. **Frequency Counting**:
   - The `uniq -c` command applies a frequency count to each word, which is a basic statistical operation in linguistics.

4. **Sorting**:
   - The `sort -n` command arranges the words by their frequency, providing a ranked list.

5. **Selection**:
   - The `tail -n 20` command selects the top 20 most frequent words, which is a common operation in text analysis to identify key terms.

### Summary:
The command processes the text file, tokenizes it, counts word frequencies, sorts the results, and outputs the 20 most frequent words. This is a straightforward example of text analysis using basic command-line tools.
