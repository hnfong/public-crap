Let's break this down step by step and explain the output of the command in terms of basic linguistic principles.

### Command Breakdown:
1. **`cat wowfanfic.txt`**:
   - This reads the entire content of the file `wowfanfic.txt` and outputs it to standard output.

2. **`perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "
"; }'`**:
   - The `perl` command processes the input line by line.
   - `split(/\s/)` splits each line into an array of words, using whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) as the delimiter.
   - `foreach (@a) { print $_ . "
"; }` iterates over the array of words and prints each word on a new line.
   - The result is a plain list of words, one per line, with no extra whitespace.

3. **`sort`**:
   - This sorts the words alphabetically. If there are duplicate words, they will appear consecutively.

4. **`uniq -c`**:
   - This counts the occurrences of each unique word. The output format is `count word`, e.g., `3 hello`.

5. **`sort -n`**:
   - This sorts the output of `uniq -c` numerically by the count (first by the number of occurrences, then alphabetically by the word itself).

6. **`tail -n 20`**:
   - This displays the last 20 lines of the output.

### Probable Output:
The final output will be a list of the 20 most frequent words in the file, sorted first by frequency (in descending order) and then alphabetically for ties. Each line will display the count of the word followed by the word itself.

For example:
```
   5 hello
   3 world
   3 of
   2 a
   2 the
   ...
```

### Explanation in Linguistic Terms:
1. **Tokenization**:
   - The `split(/\s/)` function acts as a tokenizer, breaking the text into individual words (tokens) based on whitespace.

2. **Frequency Counting**:
   - The `uniq -c` function performs a frequency count, which is a basic statistical operation in linguistics to determine how often each word appears.

3. **Sorting**:
   - The `sort` commands ensure that the output is ordered in a meaningful way. The first `sort` orders the words alphabetically, while the second `sort -n` orders them numerically by frequency.

4. **Selection**:
   - The `tail -n 20` function selects the top 20 most frequent words, which is a common operation in text analysis to identify key terms or themes.

### Summary:
The command processes the text file, tokenizes it into words, counts the frequency of each word, sorts the results, and displays the top 20 most frequent words. This is a straightforward example of text analysis using basic linguistic and computational tools.
