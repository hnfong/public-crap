 Alice is correct in the context of standard atmospheric pressure. Pure water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). However, Bob could be correct under certain conditions.

Water can exist in a supercooled state below its normal freezing point without turning into ice. This can happen when water is very pure and has no nucleation sites, such as dust particles or impurities, for ice crystals to form. In a laboratory setting, or under very controlled conditions, water can be supercooled to temperatures well below 0 degrees Celsius, potentially reaching -10 degrees Celsius or lower before it finally freezes.

Additionally, saltwater has a lower freezing point than freshwater. For example, seawater with a typical salinity of about 3.5% freezes at about -1.9 degrees Celsius. Therefore, in the context of saltwater or supercooled pure water, Bob's statement that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius could be correct.

In summary, under standard conditions, water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, but under certain conditions, such as supercooling or the presence of salt, it can freeze at lower temperatures, including -10 degrees Celsius. [end of text]
