A delightful example of a semantic debate!

**Who is right?** Both, in a sense. Here's a brief explanation:

* **Alice is right in the literal sense**: Pure water (with no impurities or pressure changes) freezes at 0°C (32°F) under standard atmospheric pressure. This is the **melting/freezing point** of water.
* **Bob is right in the contextual sense**: At -10°C, water **is indeed frozen** (if it had the opportunity to reach thermal equilibrium at that temperature). Bob's statement implies the state of water at -10°C, not the freezing point itself.

**Resolution**:
To clarify, the conversation could continue like this:

Alice: "You're right, Bob, at -10°C, water is frozen. However, the **freezing point** of water (where it starts to freeze) is still 0°C."

Bob: "Ah, I see! I meant the state of water at -10°C, not the point at which it freezes. Thanks for the clarification!" [end of text]
