This is a delightful and slightly eerie set of lyrics. The lighthearted melody contrasts sharply with the dark, finality of the ending, creating a classic "fairy tale with a twist" atmosphere.

Here is the story the lyrics tell, interpreted literally within a fantastical setting.

### The Story: The Forest's Final Feast for the Departed

**The Setting**
Deep within an ancient, enchanted forest, there exists a small, hidden restaurant. It is not a place for the living. The restaurant has no reservation system because it does not accept bookings from the living; it only accepts those who have "lost their way" (metaphorically or literally) and have no pockets left to hold their belongings (signifying they have nothing left to lose in life).

**The Arrival**
The protagonist (or the narrator) is a spirit or a soul who has wandered into the forest. They are led here not by a map, but by the "acorns" (perhaps a trail of breadcrumbs or spiritual markers) that lead them to the restaurant. The restaurant is empty of living customers, but the birds outside are laughing, suggesting a supernatural atmosphere where nature itself is aware of the guests' true nature.

**The Atmosphere**
The restaurant is whimsical and chaotic. The roof is painted a bright, unnatural red. The kitchen is a symphony of classical instruments (violin, flute, cello, viola), implying that the cooking process is a magical performance. The menu is simple: "Everything is a recommendation." There is no dessert, which is a crucial clue. In many cultures, dessert represents the "sweet ending" or the continuation of life; its absence signals that this is a final meal.

**The Ritual**
The owner welcomes the guests with a cheerful "Welcome, welcome." The instruction is clear: "Eat until you are full, then go to sleep." This is not a nap; it is the transition from life to death. The phrase "Tomorrow is tomorrow, et cetera" implies that for these guests, there is no tomorrow. Time stops for them here.

**The Climax**
The guests (who are likely spirits or souls) are dancing wildly ("right to left, oh my"). Even the "tamed bear" (a familiar spirit or a guardian of the forest) joins the dance. The food served is a lavish, international spread (Carpathian carpaccio, Paella, Hors d'oeuvres, Risotto), representing the final, rich memories of the lives they lived.

**The Twist (The Literal Interpretation)**
The most chilling line is: **"We will deliver it all the way to the grave."**

In this literal fantastical setting, the restaurant is a **funeral procession disguised as a dining hall**. The "Full Course" is the final meal served to the dead before they are buried. The "sleep" they are told to take is their eternal rest in the earth. The "grave" mentioned is the destination of the meal—and the guests themselves.

### Summary of the Narrative Arc
1.  **The Lost Soul:** A spirit wanders into the forest, having lost all earthly attachments (empty pockets).
2.  **The Invitation:** They are guided to a magical, empty restaurant where the only rule is to eat and sleep.
3.  **The Feast:** They enjoy a chaotic, musical, and delicious final banquet, dancing with forest spirits.
4.  **The Departure:** The meal is not for sustenance, but a ritual. The food and the guests are carried together to their final resting place (the grave) to complete the cycle of life.

The "mischievous" tone of the melody serves to mask the horror of the situation. It is a "happy" death, a gentle, festive send-off where the dead are treated to a grand party before being laid to rest, making the transition from life to the afterlife feel like a delightful, if final, adventure.
