The command you've provided is a pipeline of several Unix/Linux commands that process the contents of `wowfanfic.txt`. Let's break down the command and its probable output:

1. `cat wowfanfic.txt`: This command reads the contents of `wowfanfic.txt` and outputs it to the standard output (stdout).

2. `perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'`: This Perl one-liner reads each line of the input and splits it into words based on whitespace (`\s`). It then prints each word on a new line.

3. `sort`: This command sorts the words in alphabetical order.

4. `uniq -c`: This command counts the occurrences of each unique word in the sorted list.

5. `sort -n`: This command sorts the word counts in numerical order.

6. `tail -n 20`: This command outputs the last 20 lines of the sorted word counts.

The probable output of this command will be a list of the 20 most frequently occurring words in `wowfanfic.txt`, along with their respective counts. The words will be listed in ascending order of frequency.

From a linguistic perspective, this command is essentially performing a frequency analysis of the words in your fan fiction. It is identifying the most common words used in your text, which can provide insights into the language and style of your writing. For example, if the most frequent words are common nouns and verbs, it might suggest that your writing is straightforward and descriptive. If the most frequent words are proper nouns (e.g., character names), it might suggest that your writing is heavily focused on specific characters or events.

It's important to note that this analysis is based on word frequency and does not take into account the context or meaning of the words. Therefore, it may not provide a complete picture of the linguistic features of your writing. However, it can still be a useful tool for identifying patterns and trends in your text. [end of text]
