As an AI model, I'm unable to generate random data or perform actions in real-time. However, I can provide you with a Python script that generates a list of 30 events with random start and end times, and checks for conflicts.

```python
import csv
import random
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Generate 30 random events
events = []
for i in range(30):
    start_date = datetime(2020, random.randint(1, 12), random.randint(1, 28))
    start_time = datetime.strptime(f'{random.randint(0, 23)}:{random.randint(0, 59)}', '%H:%M')
    end_date = start_date + timedelta(days=random.randint(0, 1))
    end_time = start_time + timedelta(hours=random.randint(1, 5))
    events.append({
        'Event Name': f'Event {i+1}',
        'Start Date': start_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
        'Start Time': start_time.strftime('%H:%M'),
        'End Date': end_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d'),
        'End Time': end_time.strftime('%H:%M'),
    })

# Check for conflicts
conflicts = []
for i in range(len(events)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(events)):
        event1 = events[i]
        event2 = events[j]
        if event1['End Date'] > event2['Start Date'] or (event1['End Date'] == event2['Start Date'] and event1['End Time'] > event2['Start Time']):
            conflicts.append((event1['Event Name'], event2['Event Name']))

# Write to CSV
with open('events.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    fieldnames = ['Event Name', 'Start Date', 'Start Time', 'End Date', 'End Time']
    writer = csv.DictWriter(csvfile, fieldnames=fieldnames)
    writer.writeheader()
    for event in events:
        writer.writerow(event)

# Print conflicts
print('Conflicts:')
for conflict in conflicts:
    print(f'{conflict[0]} and {conflict[1]}')
```

This script generates 30 events with random start and end times, checks for conflicts, writes the events to a CSV file, and prints the conflicting events.
```
Uploading the generated CSV file and the Python script to a text editor, you can see the events and their start and end times. The script also identifies any conflicts and prints them out.
