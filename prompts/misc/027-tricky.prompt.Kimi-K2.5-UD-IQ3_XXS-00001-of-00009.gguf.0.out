The user is asking two questions about water freezing at -12°C. Let me think about the physics involved.

Question A: "Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?"
- Normal freezing point of water at standard pressure is 0°C (32°F).
- Water does not freeze at -12°C under normal conditions if it's already liquid and there are nucleation sites. Wait, that's not right. Let me reconsider.
- Actually, the question is ambiguous. It could mean:
  1. Is -12°C a temperature at which water can freeze? (Yes, it's below 0°C)
  2. Is the freezing point of water -12°C? (No, it's 0°C)
  
  The most straightforward interpretation is asking whether water freezes at that temperature, implying that's the freezing point. The answer is no, the freezing point is 0°C. However, water at -12°C would be frozen (ice) if it had already frozen, or could be supercooled liquid water.

Question B: "I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?"
- This is about supercooling. Pure water can be cooled below 0°C without freezing if there are no nucleation sites (like impurities or rough surfaces) and it's cooled carefully.
- However, once it reaches -12°C or so, it becomes very unstable. The homogeneous nucleation temperature for water is around -40°C, but in practice, with a glass container, heterogeneous nucleation usually occurs around -10°C to -20°C.
- So what happens? It could:
  1. Freeze if there are nucleation sites (most likely scenario for a typical glass)
  2. Remain liquid temporarily if supercooled (metastable state), then freeze rapidly when disturbed or if ice nucleation occurs
  
  Actually, for a typical glass of water being cooled in a freezer, it will freeze as it passes through 0°C. But the question emphasizes "pure water" which suggests the supercooling phenomenon.
  
  Let me provide accurate but brief explanations:

A) No. Water freezes at 0°C (at standard pressure). At -12°C, water would already be frozen ice (if it froze at 0°C) or could be supercooled liquid water, but -12°C is not the freezing point.

B) If cooled slowly in a clean, smooth container, the water may supercool (remain liquid below 0°C) until around -12°C, at which point it will likely rapidly freeze due to ice crystal formation/nucleation. However, if there are impurities or nucleation sites, it freezes at 0°C. In most practical cases with a regular glass, it freezes into ice.

Wait, I should be more precise. The homogeneous nucleation temperature is about -40°C, but heterogeneous nucleation (on surfaces) typically occurs between -10°C and -20°C for water in glass containers. So at -12°C, supercooled water would likely freeze.

Actually, looking at standard physics:
- Pure water can supercool to about -10°C to -20°C before spontaneous freezing occurs
- At -12°C, if it hasn't frozen yet, it's in a metastable supercooled state and will freeze if disturbed or given enough time

So the answer should mention supercooling.

Let me draft concise answers:

A) No. The freezing point of water is 0°C at standard pressure. At -12°C, water would already be ice (if frozen at 0°C) or potentially supercooled liquid, but -12°C is not the temperature at which freezing begins.

B) Likely it will freeze into ice. However, if the water is very pure and the glass is smooth, it may supercool (remain liquid) temporarily below 0°C, then rapidly freeze around -12°C when ice crystals finally nucleate. Without supercooling, it simply becomes solid ice.

Actually, for brevity and clarity:

A) No. Water freezes at 0°C (at 1 atm). At -12°C, water is already frozen into ice.

B) It turns into ice. However, very pure water in a clean container may supercool (stay liquid below 0°C) and then freeze suddenly at or below -12°C when nucleation occurs.

I think that's accurate and brief.**A) No.** At standard pressure, water freezes at 0°C, not -12°C. At -12°C, water would already be frozen solid (ice), assuming it froze at its normal freezing point.

**B) It freezes into ice.** Under normal circumstances, it freezes as it cools past 0°C. However, if the water is very pure and the glass is smooth, it may **supercool** (remain liquid below 0°C) until approximately -12°C, at which point it will rapidly and violently freeze due to spontaneous ice nucleation.
