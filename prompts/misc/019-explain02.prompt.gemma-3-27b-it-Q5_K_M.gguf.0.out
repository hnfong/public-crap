Okay, imagine our Houses of Parliament in London, where grown-ups make rules for everyone in the UK, right?

Well, China is a *very* big country, much bigger than the UK! And they have a group of grown-ups who make rules for *all* of China. It's called the National People's Congress!

Think of it like a giant classroom with LOTS and LOTS of students (over 3,000!). These "students" are chosen from all over China, from different cities and farms and everywhere. 

They all get together in a big meeting in Beijing (that's the capital city of China, like London is for the UK) and they talk about what's best for China. They decide things like:

* **How to spend money:** Like deciding if there should be more parks or schools.
* **What the rules should be:** Like making sure everyone is safe and happy.

It's a bit different from how we do things here, because in the UK lots of different people can stand for Parliament. In China, the people who get to be in the National People's Congress are chosen in a different way.

But the main idea is the same: it's a group of people who work together to make rules and decisions for the whole country!



Does that make sense?  We can talk about it more if you like!
