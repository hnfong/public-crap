Okay, let me start by breaking down the user's requirements. They want 8 evaluation questions for LLMs with specific constraints. First, the questions need to be concise, varying in difficulty from easy to hard. They should cover diverse topics, mix English and Chinese, and have objective assessment methods. Also, creativity is emphasized, plus language-specific constraints: English questions must include a word with "z", Chinese ones must use "平".

Hmm, starting with Q1 as easy. Maybe a simple factual question in English with "z". "Zebra" comes to mind—easy animal classification. For Q2, slightly harder, still English with "z". How about a math puzzle? "Zero" fits. Q3 can switch to Chinese with "平". A common idiom or phrase? "平步青云" is a good one, testing idiom knowledge.

Q4 needs to be more challenging. Maybe a logic puzzle in English with "z". "Zebra puzzle" is classic but might be too known. Could tweak it. Q5 in Chinese, using "平", maybe a historical event? "平型关大捷" tests historical knowledge. Q6 should be interdisciplinary. Science in English with "z"—"zinc" in chemistry, linking to biology.

Q7, harder, multi-step reasoning. Chinese with "平", maybe a legal concept? "平等原则" in law, requiring application. Q8, the hardest, creative synthesis. English with "z", combining tech and ethics. "Zero-day exploit" in cybersecurity, needing ethical analysis.

Wait, need to ensure each question meets the language constraints. Check each: Q1 "zebra", Q2 "zero", Q3 "平步青云", Q4 "zebra puzzle" (has "z"), Q5 "平型关", Q6 "zinc", Q7 "平等", Q8 "zero-day". All good.

Assessment should be objective. For factual ones, short answers. For puzzles, specific outputs. For essays, clear criteria. Mix of multiple-choice and short answers where possible. Avoid long essays but allow brief explanations.

Creativity check: Using zebra puzzle, Chinese idioms, historical battles, chemistry, law, cybersecurity. Topics span biology, math, language, history, science, ethics. Good variety.

Difficulty progression: Q1 animal ID (easy), Q2 math (medium), Q3 idiom (medium), Q4 logic puzzle (hard), Q5 history (medium-hard), Q6 interdisciplinary (hard), Q7 legal application (harder), Q8 ethical analysis (hardest). Seems gradual.

Now, format each question concisely, add answer keys where needed. Ensure Chinese questions use "平" correctly. Double-check all constraints are met. Looks solid.
