In this scenario, Alice and Bob face a critical decision involving the interaction of **Kindle** and **Orim, Samite Healer**. Here's the breakdown of the optimal play and outcomes:

---

### **Key Mechanics and Rules**
1. **Kindle** (Instant):  
   - Deals **X damage** to any target, where **X = 2 + the number of cards named "Kindle" in all graveyards**.  
   - **No mana cost** (as per the problem statement).  
   - **Instant** effect: Resolves immediately when cast.  

2. **Orim, Samite Healer** (Legendary Creature):  
   - **Tap ability**: "Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."  
   - **Attack/Power**: 1/3 (not relevant here).  
   - **Summoning sickness**: Not applicable, as Orim has been on the battlefield for a while.  

3. **Graveyard Interaction**:  
   - If Alice casts **Kindle**, it goes to the graveyard.  
   - If Bob casts **Kindle** (not in this scenario), it would add to the graveyard count.

### **Optimal Play for Alice**
- **Goal**: Kill Orim.  
- **Action**: Cast **Kindle**.  
  - **Why?**  
    - **No mana cost** (as per the problem statement).  
    - **Instant** effect: Resolves immediately, dealing damage before Orim can use its ability.  
    - **Damage Calculation**:  
      - If Alice has **two copies of Kindle** in her hand, casting one would add **1** to the graveyard count (assuming no other Kindle cards are in the graveyard).  
      - **X = 2 + 1 = 3**.  
      - **Damage**: 3.  
      - **Orim's Toughness**: 3.  
      - **Result**: Orim dies.  

- **Why Not Use Orim's Ability?**  
  - Orim's ability is **preventive** (only stops the next 3 damage).  
  - If Alice casts **Kindle** first, the damage is dealt **before** Orim can use its ability.  
  - If Alice waits, Orim could use its ability to prevent the damage, but **no mana is available** for Bob to cast spells (his lands are tapped out).  

---

### **Optimal Play for Bob**
- **Goal**: Prevent Alice from killing Orim.  
- **Action**: **Do nothing**.  
  - **Why?**  
    - **No mana** to cast spells (Bob's lands are tapped out).  
    - **No other cards** in his hand to counter Alice's **Kindle**.  
    - **Orim's ability** is irrelevant here, as Alice's **Kindle** is cast first.  

---

### **Outcome**
- **Alice wins**:  
  - Casts **Kindle**, dealing **3 damage** to Orim.  
  - Orim's toughness is **3**, so it dies.  
  - **No counterplay** from Bob due to lack of mana.  

- **Game State**:  
  - Alice's hand: Empty (after casting).  
  - Orim: Dead.  
  - Bob: No cards in hand, no mana.  

---

### **Conclusion**
- **Alice's optimal play**: Cast **Kindle** immediately.  
- **Bob's optimal play**: Do nothing (no viable counter).  
- **Result**: Alice kills Orim, leveraging the **instant** nature of **Kindle** and the **graveyard count** mechanic.  

This outcome hinges on the **instant** effect of **Kindle** and the **graveyard count** rule, which allows Alice to maximize damage before Orim can react. [end of text]
