**A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?**  
**Answer:** No.  
**Explanation:** Pure water typically freezes at **0°C (32°F)** under standard atmospheric pressure. At -12°C, water is **below its freezing point**, but whether it freezes depends on factors like **purity** and **nucleation sites**. If there are no impurities or disturbances, water can remain in a **supercooled liquid state** below 0°C.

**B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?**  
**Answer:** It may remain liquid or freeze, depending on conditions.  
**Explanation:** If the water is **pure** and **cooled slowly** without agitation or impurities, it can become **supercooled** and remain a liquid at -12°C. However, if there is a **disturbance** (like shaking the glass or adding a small ice crystal), it can trigger **instant freezing**. [end of text]
