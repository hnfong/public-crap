(Verse 1)
Yo, listen up, let me break it down,  
Federal Reserve, they run the financial town.  
Think of 'em like the DJ at the club,  
Mixing tracks, keeping the vibe, no scrub.

They control the cash flow, like the beat in the track,  
Make sure the economy don't crash, keep it on track.  
They set the interest rates, like the tempo of the song,  
Too high, it's a drag; too low, it's wrong.

(Chorus)
Fed Reserve, they got the power,  
Keep the economy smooth, like butter.  
They print the dough, they lend it out,  
Make sure the streets stay lit, no doubt.

(Verse 2)
When the economy's hot, they cool it down,  
When it's cold, they turn the heat up, no frown.  
They're the bank for all the banks, you see,  
Got the cash to keep the game free.

They watch inflation, like a hawk in the sky,  
Make sure prices don't fly too high, or die.  
They're the safety net, the backup plan,  
Got the country's back, like a bulletproof van.

(Chorus)
Fed Reserve, they got the power,  
Keep the economy smooth, like butter.  
They print the dough, they lend it out,  
Make sure the streets stay lit, no doubt.

(Bridge)
They're the ones who step in when the market's in a bind,  
Like a hero in a movie, they find the silver lining.  
They advise the prez, they guide the nation,  
Keep the financial game in rotation.

(Outro)
So when you hear about the Fed, now you know,  
They're the ones who keep the economy in the flow.  
Just like a rapper needs the beat to shine,  
The economy needs the Fed to stay in line. [end of text]
