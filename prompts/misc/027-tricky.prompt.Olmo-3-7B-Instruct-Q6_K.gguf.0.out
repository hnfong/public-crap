**A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?**  
No. Water freezes at 0°C (32°F) under standard atmospheric pressure. At -12°C, it is well below the freezing point, so it remains in liquid form unless pressure or impurities are involved.

**B) What happens if a glass of pure water is cooled to -12°C?**  
If you cool pure water to -12°C in normal atmospheric pressure, it will remain liquid. To freeze water at this temperature, you would need to increase the pressure (e.g., in an ice skater's shoes or high-pressure containers), but under normal conditions, the water stays liquid. [end of text]
