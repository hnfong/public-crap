A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius. This is a fundamental property of water, which is why it is commonly used as a coolant in various applications, such as in cars, refrigerators, and air conditioning systems.

B) If you have a glass of pure water and it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will freeze. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius, and any water that is cooled below this temperature will freeze. The temperature at which water freezes is a critical factor in many practical applications, including the cooling of electronic devices and the freezing of ice in various outdoor activities.
