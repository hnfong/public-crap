I want you to generate a fictional list of events with their start date/time and end/date time. The columns are:

Event Name,Start Date,Start Time,End Date,End Time

In csv format.
Give me 30 rows. Try to make some of them conflict. Do not have the dates sorted. Just make them random. The dates should be in 2020s.

After you have generated 30 rows, tell me which of the events you generated have conflicted and why.

**Conflict Analysis:**

Conflicts are identified based on overlapping dates and times for events. Given the complexity and the random nature of the dates, conflicts are categorized into two types: **Direct Overlap** (events happening at the same time on the same day) and **Partial Overlap** (events overlapping in time but not necessarily starting or ending on the same day).

1. **Direct Overlap Conflicts:**
   - **Music Festival** and **Gaming Tournament** on July 22, 2022.
   - **Tech Expo 2023** and **Food Festival** on April 15, 2023 (though they end on different days, they start on the same day with overlapping times).

2. **Partial Overlap Conflicts:**
   - **Business Conference** (Apr 12-14, 2023) and **Tech Expo 2023** (Apr 15-17, 2023): While not on the same day, organizers or attendees might find it challenging to participate in both due to the consecutive scheduling.
   - **Seminar Series** (Mar 1-31, 2023) overlaps with **Pet Show** (Mar 19, 2023), and **Seminar Series** also overlaps with the start of **Tech Expo 2023** (Apr 15, 2023), potentially causing scheduling conflicts for participants.
   - **Photography Contest** (Oct 1-31, 2022) overlaps with **Volunteer Day** (Sep 17, 2022), and **Comedy Night** (May 28, 2022), but given its month-long duration, it's more about prolonged overlap rather than direct scheduling conflict.
   - **Language Course** (May 4 - Jul 31, 2020) overlaps with **Film Festival** (Jun 10-14, 2020), and **Health Seminar** (Sep 2, 2020), indicating a prolonged period where participants might have to choose between events on specific days. [end of text]
