Okay, imagine you live in London, right? You have your mummy and daddy who make the rules for your house, like "no jumping on the sofa" or "eat your dinner."

Now, think about China. It's a *huge* place, much bigger than London! It has lots and lots of people, maybe like having a giant playground with thousands and thousands of kids.

China also needs rules, just like your house does, but for *everyone* there. So, they have a big group of people who help make those rules. This big group is called the **National People's Congress**.

Think of them like a very, very big team of grown-ups who get together to talk about what rules China needs. They discuss things like how to make sure everyone has food, how to keep the country safe, and how to build roads and schools.

So, the National People's Congress is like the big team of rule-makers for all the people in China, helping to decide how their giant country should work. They make the important decisions for everyone there, just like your mummy and daddy make decisions for you and your family at home. [end of text]
