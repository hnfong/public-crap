Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Give me your interpretation. You do not have to translate the contents, but you may if you wish.

What a delightful set of lyrics!

After reading through them, I've come up with an interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting. Here's my take:

The story revolves around a whimsical, hidden restaurant deep in the forest, which can only be found by following a trail of acorns (ドングリ). The restaurant is tiny, and its patrons are mostly forgotten people who stumble upon it by chance. Despite having no reservations, the restaurant welcomes everyone with open arms.

The atmosphere is lively, with birds chirping and laughing (小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる) as the lunch hour approaches. The menu is simple, with only a few recommended dishes, but the kitchen is filled with the enchanting sounds of violin, flute, cello, and viola music.

The restaurant's staff, perhaps led by a charismatic host or chef, invite customers to indulge in a fantastical feast, promising that they'll be so full they'll want to take a nap (たらふく食べたらお眠りよ). The menu items mentioned, such as Carpaccio, Paella, and Risotto, suggest a eclectic and exotic culinary experience.

The most intriguing aspect, however, is the promise to deliver food even to the grave (お墓の中まで届けましょう). This could be interpreted as the restaurant's ability to cater to the spirits of the forest, or perhaps even the dearly departed. The final line, "今宵は最後のフルコース" (Tonight is the last full course), implies that this might be a special, one-time event, or a farewell feast before the restaurant disappears into the forest once again.

Throughout the lyrics, there's a sense of wonder, magic, and playfulness, which fits perfectly with the lighthearted and mischievous melody. The story is fantastical, yet it's grounded in a sense of whimsy and possibility, making it feel like a delightful, hidden gem waiting to be discovered.
