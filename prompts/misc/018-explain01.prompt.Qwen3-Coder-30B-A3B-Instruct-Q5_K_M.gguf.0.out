**Federal Reserve - The Bank of the People (Verse)**

Yo, listen up, let me break it down real simple
Federal Reserve, that's the Fed, the bank of the system
They be making the rules, controlling the money flow
Like a DJ mixing beats, they control the cash show

They got the power to make your dollars worth more
Or make 'em worth less, that's how they play the game, yo
When times get tight, they give you more cash
When times get wild, they pull it back, that's the plan

Think of 'em like the CEO of the economy
They make the moves, we just follow the beat
They set the interest rates, like a beat drop
If it's too high, you can't spend, that's a stop

They got the keys to the money kingdom
Like a boss in the booth, they make the moves
They watch the economy, like a DJ watching the crowd
If it's getting too wild, they bring it back down

They're like the referee in the game of money
Making sure the rules are fair, that's the name
They got the power to make or break the economy
Like a rapper with the mic, they control the scene

So when you hear about interest rates or inflation
Remember, it's the Fed, they're in the game
They're the ones making the moves, the ones calling the shots
Like a mastermind, they're running the show

That's the Fed, the Federal Reserve
The bank that controls the money, that's the key
They're the ones making the moves, the ones calling the shots
Like a boss in the booth, they're running the show

**[Outro]**
So now you know, the Fed's the one with the power
To make your money work, or make it disappear
They're the ones calling the shots, the ones in control
Like a rapper with the mic, they're the ones who rule

That's the real talk, that's the Fed's role
In the game of money, they're the ones who control
The economy, the rates, the flow of the cash
That's the Federal Reserve, they're the ones who last [end of text]
