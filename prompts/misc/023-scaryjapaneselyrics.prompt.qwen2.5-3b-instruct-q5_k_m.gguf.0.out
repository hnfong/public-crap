Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Give me your interpretation. You do not have to translate the contents, but you may if you wish.

The lyrics paint a whimsical and fantastical scene, but there are elements that can be interpreted literally within a magical or enchanted forest setting. Here's a possible interpretation:

In a magical forest, there is a small restaurant hidden away. The entrance is marked by a trail of acorns, but it's a false trail, leading to a place where no one can actually find it. The restaurant is empty, with no reservations made. The walls are painted bright red, and the menu is full of recommendations, but the kitchen is silent, as if no one is cooking.

The restaurant is open for lunch, and the air is filled with the sound of birds chirping and laughing. The birds are playing with the empty pockets of the customers, leading them to the restaurant. The roof is covered in a bright red tin, and the sounds of a violin, flute, cello, and viola can be heard from the kitchen.

The lyrics invite the audience to enter the restaurant, promising a feast that will leave them sleeping soundly. The restaurant is full of various dishes, including Caponata, Paella, Appetizers, Risotto, and Dessert. However, the dessert is not served, and the restaurant is preparing to serve the final course of the night, which will be delivered to the graves, even reaching the tombs.

This fantastical setting allows for a literal interpretation of the lyrics, where the forest is a magical place, and the restaurant is a hidden, enchanted establishment. The birds are playing with the pockets of the customers, leading them to the restaurant, and the final course is a symbolic gesture of farewell and remembrance. [end of text]
