Bob is right.

While water begins to freeze at 0°C, it remains solid (ice) at any temperature below that, including -10°C. Therefore, stating that water freezes at -10°C is technically correct, as it is in a frozen state at that temperature. Alice is correct about the transition point (0°C), but Bob is correct about the state of the water at -10°C. [end of text]
