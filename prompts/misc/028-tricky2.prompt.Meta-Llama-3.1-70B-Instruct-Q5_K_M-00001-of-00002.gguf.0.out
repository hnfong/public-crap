Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Alice is right. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius. Bob's statement is incorrect, and his insistence that he is still right is incorrect as well. [end of text]
