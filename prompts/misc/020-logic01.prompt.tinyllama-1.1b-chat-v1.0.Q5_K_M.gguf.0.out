If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

Certainly, there are several theories that are called "consistent" or "tautological". These are theories that can be proved in an unrestricted setting (i.e., without any restrictions on the input data or assumptions), and they always lead to the same conclusion regardless of the inputs. Examples of such theories include:

1. GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem: This is a theoretic result that states that some statements that are true in the realm of mathematical logic cannot be proved to be true in the larger context of all possible worlds.

2. Deductive logic: This is a branch of logic that deals with deductive reasoning, which involves applying rules of logic to produce conclusions without the need for any additional assumptions.

3. Classical logic: This is a branch of logic that deals with the logic of propositions and their truth values, and it includes such principles as truth-functional properties, tautologies, and classicality.

4. Mathematical induction: This is a method of proof that involves generating a proof by induction based on previously proven statements. Induction is used in fields like mathematics, logic, and computer science to prove theorems.

5. Bayes' theorem: This is a mathematical theorem that states that if two probabilistic statements are true and independent of each other, then their probabilistic sum is also true.

These theories are not called "consistent" or "tautological" because they are not provable in a strict sense. Instead, they are considered consistent because they always lead to the same conclusion in the absence of any restrictions or assumptions, regardless of the data or assumptions used to generate the conclusion.
