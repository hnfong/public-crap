Okay, so I need to perform a semantic "grep" on the given input based on the query. The query is asking for names of countries or regions, and I should output each line that contains these names along with their line numbers. The output should be similar to using grep with the -n and -o flags, which means showing the line number and only the matched part. Also, each output line should be separated by "---".

First, I'll go through each line of the input one by one and check if it contains any country or region names. I need to make sure that the match is obvious and not just a tangential mention.

Starting from line 1: "Let's Talk about Unfair Trade Restrictions" – no country names here.

Line 2: Talks about countries imposing restrictions but doesn't name any specific country.

Line 4: Mentions Britain, Silesia, France, and the UK. Britain and UK refer to the same country, so I should note Britain and UK. Silesia is a region, so that's also a match. France is a country.

Line 6: Refers to France, Portugal, and Germany. All are countries.

Line 15: Talks about England, Hamburg, Dantzic, and Riga. England is a country, Hamburg, Dantzic (Gdańsk), and Riga are cities, but since the query is about regions, maybe cities count as regions. However, the user might be more interested in countries, so I'm a bit unsure. But since the query includes regions, I'll include them.

Line 17: Mentions England and France.

Line 19: Talks about England and France again.

So, I'll extract the country and region names from these lines. For each occurrence, I'll note the line number and the name. I need to make sure not to repeat the same country in the same line if it appears multiple times. For example, in line 4, Britain and UK are the same, so I'll list each separately but they refer to the same country.

Wait, but the user wants the names as they appear, so if a line has multiple country names, each should be listed separately with the same line number. So in line 4, Britain, Silesia, France, and UK are all separate entries.

I should structure the output as "line_number: country/region_name" for each match, separated by "---".

Let me list them out:

Line 4: Britain, Silesia, France, UK
Line 6: France, Portugal, Germany
Line 15: England, Hamburg, Dantzic, Riga
Line 17: England, France
Line 19: England, France

Wait, but in line 15, Hamburg, Dantzic, and Riga are cities, not countries. The query is about countries or regions. Regions can include cities, but I'm not sure if the user wants cities. The initial example in the problem statement included regions like Silesia, which is a region. So maybe including cities is acceptable as regions.

Alternatively, if the user only wants countries, then I should exclude the cities. But the query says "countries or regions," so regions could include cities. Therefore, I'll include them.

So the final output will include all these names with their respective line numbers.
