A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) at standard atmospheric pressure. At -12 degrees Celsius, water would be in a supercooled state, meaning it is below its freezing point but has not yet turned into ice.

B) If a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will enter a supercooled state. In this state, the water is below its freezing point but has not yet formed ice crystals. However, if the supercooled water is disturbed or comes into contact with a nucleation site (such as a dust particle or the glass itself), it can rapidly freeze and form ice. [end of text]
