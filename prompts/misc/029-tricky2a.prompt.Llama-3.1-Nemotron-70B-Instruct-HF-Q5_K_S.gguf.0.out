Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

A clever conversation!

**Both are right, but in different contexts:**

* **Alice is right about the freezing point**: Water indeed freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32°F) under standard atmospheric pressure.
* **Bob is right about the outcome at -10°C**: At -10°C, water is **already frozen** (since it passed the freezing point of 0°C). So, in the context of "what happens to water at -10°C", Bob's response "It freezes" implies that it **remains in a frozen state**, which is correct. A more precise response from Bob might have been "It remains frozen" to avoid the confusion. [end of text]
