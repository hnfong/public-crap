This is a retelling of the classic fairy tale **Snow White** using only emojis.

Here is the breakdown:
*   **Line 1:** A princess lives with her family, but the Queen (her stepmother) becomes angry/jealous.
*   **Line 2:** The Queen asks her magic mirror who is the fairest, and the mirror says it is Snow White.
*   **Line 3:** The evil Queen gives Snow White a poisoned apple, and she appears to die (coffin).
*   **Line 4:** She is watched over by forest animals (bear, squirrel, bird) while she sleeps.
*   **Line 5:** A Prince arrives, kisses her (or places a ring on her finger), and she wakes up; they live happily ever after.

**Popular Culture Connection:**
This story is most famously associated with **Disney's 1937 animated film**, *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs*. It is one of the most recognizable stories in Western culture, establishing tropes like the "evil stepmother," the "magic mirror," and "true love's kiss" that appear in countless movies, books, and TV shows (such as *Shrek*, *Once Upon a Time*, or *Mirror Mirror*).
