**(Verse 1)**
Yo, step in the studio, let me break it down,
The Fed’s the boss when it’s about the town.
They control the money, yeah, they run the game,
Like a DJ in the boardroom, keepin’ the economy straight.

They print the cash, they lend it out,
Like a hustler movin’ product, keepin’ it smooth.
Too much money floatin’? They hit the brakes,
Raise the rates, make it harder to take the stakes.

**(Pre-Chorus)**
They’re like the bouncer at the club,
Keepin’ the economy from goin’ off the rails.
Too wild? They lock it down,
Too slow? They pump it up—keep the vibe right now.

**(Chorus)**
Federal Reserve, yeah, they keep the check,
Like a cap in the game, they keep the deck.
Inflation too high? They cool it down,
Unemployment high? They throw the cash around.

**(Verse 2)**
They got the tools, yeah, they playin’ it tight,
Like a rapper with a fresh beat, they keep it right.
They got the "open market" like a fresh drop,
Buyin’ bonds to keep the economy from stoppin’.

Too many folks jobless? They print some more,
Like a free album drop—keep the people core.
But watch too close? They’ll raise the price,
Like a ticket hike at the concert—ain’t no surprise.

**(Bridge)**
They’re not just printin’ bills, nah, they thinkin’ deep,
Like a strategist with a long-term scheme.
They balance the scales, keep the economy tight,
So the streets stay rich but don’t go out of sight.

**(Outro)**
So next time you see the news and they talkin’ Fed,
Know they’re just keepin’ the game in check.
Like a rapper with a hit, they keep it real,
The Fed’s the backbone—keepin’ the economy feelin’ clean.
