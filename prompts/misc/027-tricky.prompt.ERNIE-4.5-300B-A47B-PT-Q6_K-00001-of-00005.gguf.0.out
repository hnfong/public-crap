**A)** No, water does not freeze at -12째C under standard atmospheric pressure. The freezing point of pure water is 0째C at 1 atm. For water to freeze at -12째C, external pressure would need to be significantly altered (e.g., under high-pressure conditions), which is not typical in everyday scenarios.  

**B)** If pure water is cooled to -12째C under standard pressure, it remains in a **supercooled liquid state** if no impurities or nucleation sites (e.g., dust, bubbles) are present to initiate ice crystal formation. However, supercooled water is unstable, and any disturbance (e.g., tapping the glass or introducing a seed crystal) would trigger rapid freezing. If nucleation occurs, the water will freeze abruptly, releasing latent heat and potentially causing the glass to crack due to expansion. Without nucleation, it stays liquid but highly metastable.
