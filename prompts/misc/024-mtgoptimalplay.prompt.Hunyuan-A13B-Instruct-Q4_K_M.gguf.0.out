To determine the optimal play for both Alice and Bob, let's break down the situation step by step, considering the game mechanics of Magic: The Gathering (MTG) as of 2024.

---

### **Alice's Hand:**
- Two copies of **Kindle** (instant spell).
- **Kindle** deals damage to any target equal to 2 plus the number of cards named "Kindle" in all graveyards.

---

### **Bob's Board:**
- **Orim, Samite Healer** (untapped legendary creature with 1/3 power/toughness).
- **Orim's ability**: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."

---

### **Game State:**
- It is Alice's turn.
- Bob has no cards in hand, and his lands are tapped out.
- Alice has sufficient mana to cast any spells.

---

### **Analysis of the Situation:**

1. **Alice's Goal:**
   - Alice wants to kill Orim, the legendary creature, to remove the threat to her burn deck.

2. **Bob's Goal:**
   - Bob wants to prevent Alice from killing Orim and ideally keep him on the board to block her attackers or deal damage back to her.

3. **Key Mechanics:**
   - **Orim's ability**: If Bob taps Orim, he prevents the next 3 damage that would be dealt to him this turn. This means Alice can deal at most 2 damage to Orim before his ability stops it.
   - **Kindle's ability**: The damage dealt by Kindle depends on the number of "Kindle" cards in graveyards. If Alice plays multiple Kindle spells, the damage increases significantly.

4. **Graveyard Considerations:**
   - If Alice has previously played Kindle spells and they have gone to the graveyard, the damage potential of her Kindle spells increases. For example:
     - If 1 Kindle is in the graveyard, each Kindle deals 3 damage.
     - If 2 Kindles are in the graveyard, each Kindle deals 4 damage.

---

### **Optimal Play:**

#### **Alice's Turn:**
Alice can play both Kindle spells in her hand in one turn. Here's how it resolves:

1. **First Kindle:**
   - Alice casts the first Kindle. Since there are no Kindles in the graveyard yet, it deals 2 damage to Orim (2 + 0).
   - After this spell resolves, the first Kindle goes to the graveyard.

2. **Second Kindle:**
   - Alice casts the second Kindle. Now there is 1 Kindle in the graveyard, so this Kindle deals 3 damage to Orim (2 + 1).
   - After this spell resolves, the second Kindle goes to the graveyard.

3. **Total Damage to Orim:**
   - The total damage dealt to Orim is 2 + 3 = 5 damage.
   - Orim has 3 toughness, so this deals 5 damage to him, reducing his toughness from 3 to -2. Orim is now destroyed.

---

#### **Bob's Options:**
Bob has no legal responses to prevent this outcome because:
- Bob cannot block both Kindle spells in one turn (he can only control one creature per turn).
- Bob cannot prevent damage from being dealt to Orim once the spells resolve.
- Bob cannot tap Orim in response to the first Kindle because the ability only prevents damage, not the spell itself.

---

### **Outcome:**
Alice successfully destroys Orim by playing both Kindle spells in one turn. Bob is unable to stop her because his abilities and board state do not allow him to respond effectively. This sets up Alice to attack with Orim's replacement effect (if she has one) or deal damage to Bob directly if she has other burn spells.

---

### **Summary of Thought Process:**
- **Alice's Strategy**: Alice maximizes the damage potential of her Kindle spells by playing both in one turn. She leverages the graveyard to increase the damage output of the second Kindle.
- **Bob's Strategy**: Bob has no legal way to stop Alice from killing Orim. His Orim's ability only reduces the damage Orim takes, but it cannot prevent the destruction of the creature.

This play is optimal for Alice and demonstrates her ability to exploit game mechanics and synergy to achieve her goal.
