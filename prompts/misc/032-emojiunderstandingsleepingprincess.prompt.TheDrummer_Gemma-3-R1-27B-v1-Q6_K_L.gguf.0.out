This is a visual retelling of **Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs**! Here's the breakdown:

*   **👸🏡👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👑😠:** The princess (Snow White) at home with her family (stepmother/evil queen is angry).
*   **👸🪞✨👸🏻👑:** The queen looking in the magic mirror ("Mirror, mirror on the wall...").
*   **👸🏻👿🍎⚰️:** The queen (disguised) offering Snow White a poisoned apple, leading to her apparent death (coffin).
*   **🐻🐿️🐦👸😴:** Animals (bear, squirrel, birds) mourning Snow White in her sleep/coffin.
*   **🤴😘💍👸💖:** The prince awakens Snow White with a kiss, they get engaged (ring), and find love.

**Popular Culture Reminder:** This is one of Disney's most iconic fairy tales! The story is instantly recognizable from the 1937 animated film and countless adaptations. The poisoned apple, the magic mirror, and the kiss of true love are all classic Disney/fairy tale tropes.
