Here are the answers to your questions:

**A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?**

Yes. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). -12 degrees Celsius is well below that freezing point, so water *will* freeze at that temperature.

**B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?**

The water will freeze into ice. At -12Â°C, the water molecules will lose enough energy to form a solid crystalline structure (ice).
