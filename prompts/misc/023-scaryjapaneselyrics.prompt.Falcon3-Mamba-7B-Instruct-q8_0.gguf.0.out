The lyrics describe a whimsical and fantastical journey through a small forest restaurant, where the protagonist embarks on a series of adventures and encounters. Here's a possible interpretation:

The protagonist starts by searching for a small forest restaurant, but finds that they've misplaced their keychain. They wander into the restaurant, which is empty, and they bump into a person who was supposed to be there but forgot. The restaurant has no reservations, and the protagonist is the only customer.

Inside, they are greeted by a cheerful staff member who recommends dishes based on the menu, which is limited to "only" one item. The restaurant is filled with the lively sounds of a band playing traditional Japanese instruments like the shakuhachi (bamboo flute), koto (stringed instrument), and shamisen (three-stringed instrument).

The protagonist is enchanted by the atmosphere and the music, and they decide to dance along. They notice a small bear dancing energetically, which adds to the magical and playful ambiance.

As the music continues, the protagonist imagines a fantastical scenario where they are a character in a story, possibly a traveler or a spirit, who is exploring the forest and its hidden delights. They wander through the forest, encountering various characters and scenes, such as a cemetery where they dance until dawn, and a final dance that transitions into a full course meal.

The lyrics end with a playful invitation to "give me your story," suggesting that the listener is invited to create their own narrative based on the whimsical and fantastical journey described in the song. The song's playful and light-hearted tone, combined with the fantastical elements, suggests a story of adventure, discovery, and the joy of unexpected encounters in a magical forest setting.
