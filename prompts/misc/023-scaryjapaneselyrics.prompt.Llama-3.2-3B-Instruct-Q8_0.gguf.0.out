What a delightful song!

The story behind these lyrics appears to be a whimsical and fantastical tale. Here's my interpretation:

The song tells the story of a mischievous spirit who has been wandering through the forest, searching for a small, hidden restaurant (, densha) that only appears to those who have forgotten their worries and troubles. The spirit is drawn to the restaurant by the promise of a delicious meal and the sound of music coming from the kitchen.

The lyrics suggest that the restaurant is a magical place where the spirit can forget its troubles and indulge in a delightful meal. The "空っぽのポケット" (empty pocket) line implies that the spirit has been carrying a heavy burden, and the restaurant is a place where it can shed its worries and leave its troubles behind.

The "メニューはおすすめ そればかり" (menu is highly recommended) line suggests that the restaurant serves a variety of dishes, but the spirit is particularly drawn to the "カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル" (calpaccio pasta area) and "リゾット デザート" (risotto dessert), which may be a nod to the spirit's love of comfort food.

The "手乗りの子熊も踊り出す" (a bear who dances with the hands) line is a literal interpretation, as the spirit encounters a bear who is dancing with its hands, perhaps as a sign of welcome or a magical gesture.

The "お墓の中まで届けましょう" (let's send it to the grave) line is a more literal interpretation, as the spirit is offering to send its worries and troubles to the afterlife, symbolizing its desire to leave its burdens behind.

The final line, "今宵は最後のフルコース" (tonight is the last course), suggests that the spirit is savoring the last bite of its meal and the last moment of its carefree existence.

Overall, the song appears to be a lighthearted and playful tale of a mischievous spirit finding solace and comfort in a magical restaurant, where it can indulge in delicious food and forget its troubles. [end of text]
