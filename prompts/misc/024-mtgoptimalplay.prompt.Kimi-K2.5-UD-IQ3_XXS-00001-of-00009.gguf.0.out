This is an interesting Magic: The Gathering puzzle involving the card Kindle and Orim, Samite Healer. Let me break down the problem and analyze it step by step.

## Understanding the Cards

**Kindle**: Instant, "Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards."

Key point: The value of X is determined when the spell resolves, not when it's cast. This is a crucial rules interaction.

**Orim, Samite Healer**: 1/3 creature with "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."

## The Situation

- Alice has 2 copies of Kindle in hand
- Bob has Orim, Samite Healer in play, untapped
- Bob's lands are tapped out (so he can't activate Orim's ability at instant speed unless he has mana sources, but the problem says lands are tapped out)
- It's Alice's turn
- Alice wants to kill Orim (which has 3 toughness)

Wait, let me re-read. "Bob's lands are tapped out" - this is during Alice's turn. So Bob has floating mana? Or does this mean Bob has no available mana? The phrase "tapped out" usually means all lands are tapped, so no mana available.

But Orim's ability costs no mana! It's just "Tap:" - so Bob can activate it by tapping Orim herself.

## The Combat Math

Orim is 1/3. To kill Orim, Alice needs to deal 3 damage.

**First Kindle**: X = 2 + 0 = 2 damage. Not enough to kill Orim alone.

If Alice casts the first Kindle:
- When it resolves, X = 2 (no Kindles in graveyard yet)
- Deals 2 damage to Orim
- Orim becomes 1/1 (with 2 damage marked)
- Then the Kindle goes to the graveyard

**Second Kindle**: X = 2 + 1 = 3 damage. This would kill Orim.

But here's the issue: Between the two Kindles resolving, Orim can activate her ability to prevent damage.

## The Sequence

Alice wants to kill Orim. Let's think about how this plays out.

**Option 1: Alice casts both Kindles at the same time (in response to each other)**

Alice casts Kindle #1, targeting Orim.
Alice casts Kindle #2, targeting Orim (in response to #1).

Stack: Kindle #2 on top, Kindle #1 on bottom.

Kindle #2 resolves first:
- X = 2 + 0 = 2 (Kindle #1 is still on the stack, not in graveyard)
- Deals 2 damage to Orim
- Kindle #2 goes to graveyard

Kindle #1 resolves:
- X = 2 + 1 = 3 (Kindle #2 is now in graveyard)
- Deals 3 damage to Orim
- Kindle #1 goes to graveyard

Total damage: 2 + 3 = 5 damage. Orim dies.

Wait, but can Bob respond? Bob can tap Orim to prevent damage. But when?

After Kindle #2 resolves, Orim has 2 damage marked. Before Kindle #1 resolves, Bob gets priority. He can tap Orim to prevent the next 3 damage.

But here's the question: Can Bob activate Orim's ability in response to the Kindle spells?

Let me think about the stack:

1. Alice casts Kindle #1 (goes on stack)
2. Alice casts Kindle #2 in response (goes on stack above #1)

Now stack is: Kindle #2, Kindle #1.

Bob gets priority after Alice casts Kindle #2. Bob can activate Orim's ability here. But if he does, he's preventing damage from... what? The next 3 damage that would be dealt. But no damage has been dealt yet.

Actually, let's think about this more carefully. If Bob activates Orim in response to Kindle #2, then when Kindle #2 resolves, the prevention effect is already in place. Kindle #2 deals 2 damage, but 2 of that is prevented, so Orim takes 0 damage. Then Kindle #1 deals 3 damage, and Orim dies (taking 3 damage, prevention already used).

Wait, that's not right either. Let me re-read Orim.

"Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."

So if Bob activates Orim in response to the Kindles, he's preventing the next 3 damage. If Kindle #2 deals 2 damage first, then 2 of that prevention is used up, leaving 1 prevention for Kindle #1's 3 damage, so Orim takes 2 damage and survives.

Actually, let me trace this through:

**Scenario A: Bob activates Orim in response to the Kindles**

Stack: Orim's ability, Kindle #2, Kindle #1

Orim's ability resolves: "The next 3 damage to any target is prevented" effect is created.

Kindle #2 resolves: Deals 2 damage. 2 of the prevention is used. Orim takes 0 damage. Prevention shield now has 1 left.

Kindle #1 resolves: Deals 3 damage. 1 is prevented, 2 gets through. Orim has 2 damage marked, survives with 1 toughness left.

Result: Orim survives with 2 damage marked (effectively 1/1).

**Scenario B: Bob waits to activate Orim**

After Kindle #2 resolves, Orim has 2 damage marked. State-based actions are checked, Orim is 1/1 with 2 damage, so she dies? No wait, 2 damage marked on a 3 toughness creature means she's a 1/1 with 2 damage, not dead yet.

Actually, let me check: A creature with toughness 3 and 2 damage marked is not dead. It's just damaged. It dies if damage ≥ toughness.

So after Kindle #2 (2 damage), Orim is 1/3 with 2 damage marked.

Before Kindle #1 resolves, both players get priority. Bob can activate Orim here.

If Bob activates Orim now, he prevents the next 3 damage. Then Kindle #1 deals 3 damage, all prevented, Orim survives.

If Bob doesn't activate Orim, Kindle #1 deals 3 damage, Orim dies.

So Bob should activate Orim after Kindle #2 resolves but before Kindle #1 resolves.

But wait - can Bob activate Orim at that point? Let me check the timing.

After Kindle #2 resolves:
1. Kindle #2 deals 2 damage to Orim
2. Kindle #2 goes to graveyard
3. Active player (Alice) gets priority

At this point, before Alice can cast more spells or pass priority, Bob can activate Orim's ability (it's a mana ability? No, it's an activated ability that costs tap).

Actually, activated abilities that aren't mana abilities use the stack. So:

After Kindle #2 resolves, Alice gets priority. If Alice passes, Bob gets priority. Bob can activate Orim. This goes on the stack.

Stack: Orim's ability, Kindle #1

Orim's ability resolves: Prevention shield of 3.

Kindle #1 resolves: Deals 3 damage, prevented, Orim survives.

So if Bob plays correctly, he can save Orim from the double-Kindle.

But wait - is there a better play for Alice?

**Option 2: Alice casts Kindle #1, lets it resolve, then casts Kindle #2**

Cast Kindle #1:
- X = 2, deals 2 damage to Orim
- Orim is now 1/1 with 2 damage (or 1/3 with 2 damage, same thing)
- Kindle #1 in graveyard

Bob can respond by tapping Orim to prevent the next 3 damage. But there's no more damage coming yet. If Bob taps now, he prevents damage from future sources.

After Kindle #1 resolves, Alice casts Kindle #2:
- X = 2 + 1 = 3 damage
- If Bob already activated Orim, the 3 damage is prevented, Orim survives.
- If Bob didn't activate Orim, Orim dies.

But Bob should activate Orim in response to Kindle #1, right? Actually, no - if Bob activates Orim in response to Kindle #1, then Kindle #1 deals 2 damage, 2 is prevented, Orim takes 0. Then Kindle #2 deals 3, Orim dies.

Wait, let's trace:

Alice casts Kindle #1.
Bob activates Orim in response.
Stack: Orim's ability, Kindle #1.

Orim's ability resolves: Prevention shield of 3.
Kindle #1 resolves: Deals 2 damage, 2 prevented, 0 gets through. Prevention shield now 1.

Kindle #1 goes to graveyard.

Alice casts Kindle #2.
Kindle #2 resolves: X = 2 + 1 = 3 damage.
Current prevention shield: 1.
So 1 prevented, 2 gets through.
Orim takes 2 damage, dies (since she has 3 toughness and 2 damage... wait, no damage was dealt before, so she just takes 2 damage and survives).

Wait, I need to be more careful. Orim started with 3 toughness. After the prevention, she took 0 damage from Kindle #1. Then she takes 2 from Kindle #2. She's a 1/3 with 2 damage, survives.

So Bob should activate Orim in response to the first Kindle!

Actually, let me re-examine. The key insight is that Bob wants to use Orim's ability to prevent as much damage as possible from the second Kindle.

If Bob activates Orim in response to Kindle #1:
- Prevention shield: 3
- Kindle #1 deals 2, 2 prevented, 0 damage, shield now 1
- Kindle #2 deals 3, 1 prevented, 2 damage, Orim survives with 2 damage marked

If Bob activates Orim after Kindle #1 resolves (before Kindle #2):
- Kindle #1 deals 2 damage, Orim has 2 damage marked
- Bob activates Orim, prevention shield 3
- Kindle #2 deals 3, 3 prevented, 0 damage, Orim survives with 2 damage marked

If Bob doesn't activate Orim at all:
- Kindle #1 deals 2, Orim has 2 damage
- Kindle #2 deals 3, Orim dies (5 total damage, toughness 3)

Wait, that's wrong. Damage doesn't accumulate like that. Each time damage is dealt, it's a new event. But the total damage marked on Orim matters.

Actually, let me be very precise about damage:

When Kindle #1 deals 2 damage, Orim has 2 damage marked.
When Kindle #2 deals 3 damage, Orim has 5 damage marked.
State-based actions check: 5 damage ≥ 3 toughness, Orim dies.

But if prevention is used, less damage is marked.

So Bob must use the prevention to survive.

Best for Bob: Activate after Kindle #1 resolves, prevent all 3 from Kindle #2. Orim ends with 2 damage marked.

Wait, can Bob activate after Kindle #1 resolves? Let me check the sequence:

1. Alice casts Kindle #1
2. Kindle #1 resolves:
   - Deals 2 damage to Orim
   - Goes to graveyard
3. Active player (Alice) gets priority

At step 3, Alice can cast Kindle #2. If she does, it goes on the stack. Before it resolves, Bob gets priority and can activate Orim.

Actually, the sequence is:
- Kindle #1 resolves, deals damage, goes to graveyard
- State-based actions are checked (Orim is fine)
- Active player (Alice) gets priority
- Alice casts Kindle #2
- Stack: Kindle #2
- Alice passes priority
- Bob gets priority, can activate Orim
- Stack: Orim's ability, Kindle #2
- Orim's ability resolves (prevention shield)
- Kindle #2 resolves: deals 3, prevented, Orim takes 0

Result: Orim survives with 2 damage marked.

Alternatively, if Bob activates in response to Kindle #1:
- Stack: Orim's ability, Kindle #1
- Orim's ability resolves (shield 3)
- Kindle #1 resolves: deals 2, 2 prevented, 0 damage, shield now 1
- Kindle #1 to graveyard
- Alice casts Kindle #2
- Kindle #2 resolves: deals 3, 1 prevented, 2 damage
- Orim has 2 damage, survives

Both result in Orim surviving, but activating after Kindle #1 is better because Orim takes less damage (0 vs 2). But actually, for survival, both work. However, taking less damage is better in case of future damage.

But wait, there's a problem. If Bob activates Orim after Kindle #1 resolves, he's tapping Orim. But Orim is already damaged. Is there any issue? No, creatures can activate abilities even when damaged.

Actually, I need to check: can Bob activate Orim's ability if Orim has lethal damage? No, Orim doesn't have lethal damage yet. She has 2 damage on 3 toughness.

So Bob can activate.

Now, is there any way for Alice to win?

What if Alice casts both Kindles at once (stacked)?

Stack: Kindle #2, Kindle #1 (bottom)

Kindle #2 resolves: X = 2 + 0 = 2 (Kindle #1 still on stack, not in graveyard)
Deals 2 damage to Orim
Kindle #2 goes to graveyard

Now: Orim has 2 damage marked. Stack: Kindle #1.

Before Kindle #1 resolves, Bob gets priority. He can activate Orim.

If Bob activates: Prevention shield 3. Kindle #1 resolves: X = 2 + 1 = 3. 3 prevented, 0 damage. Orim survives with 2 damage.

If Bob doesn't activate: Kindle #1 deals 3, Orim has 5 damage, dies.

So Bob should activate.

Result: Orim survives.

Is there any way for Alice to force the damage through?

What if Alice casts Kindle #1, and in response casts Kindle #2? We analyzed this.

Actually, I think I made an error. Let me re-read Kindle.

"Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards."

When does X get determined? It's a characteristic-defining ability for the spell? No, it's just part of the effect.

Rule 608.2h: "If an effect requires information from the game (such as the number of creatures on the battlefield), the answer is determined only once, when the effect is applied."

Wait, that's for effects. For spells with variable X, we need to check.

Actually, Kindle doesn't have X in its cost. It's an instant with a fixed mana cost (1R) that has a variable effect. The variable is determined on resolution.

From the gatherer ruling on Kindle: "The number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards is counted when Kindle resolves, not when it is cast."

So X is determined on resolution.

Now, when Alice casts two Kindles:
- If cast sequentially (one resolves, then cast the next):
  - First Kindle: X = 2 + 0 = 2, deals 2, goes to graveyard
  - Second Kindle: X = 2 + 1 = 3, deals 3
  
- If cast with both on stack:
  - Top Kindle resolves: X = 2 + 0 = 2 (other Kindle still on stack), deals 2, goes to graveyard
  - Bottom Kindle resolves: X = 2 + 1 = 3, deals 3

In both cases, the second Kindle to resolve deals 3 damage.

Bob's optimal play is to activate Orim after the first 2 damage is dealt but before the 3 damage is dealt. This prevents all 3 damage from the second Kindle, leaving Orim with 2 damage marked but alive.

Can Alice prevent Bob from doing this?

If Alice casts both Kindles in one turn, with the first resolving before she casts the second, Bob can always respond to the second Kindle by tapping Orim.

If Alice casts both Kindles with both on the stack, after the first resolves (dealing 2), Bob can respond to the second one.

Wait, actually, let's be careful about the stack.

Scenario: Alice casts Kindle #1. Then casts Kindle #2 in response.

Stack: Kindle #2 (top), Kindle #1 (bottom).

Kindle #2 resolves:
- Check X: 2 + 0 = 2 (Kindle #1 is on stack, not in graveyard)
- Deals 2 damage to Orim
- Kindle #2 goes to graveyard

Now stack is: Kindle #1.

Before Kindle #1 resolves, active player gets priority. Alice can do nothing or pass. If she passes, Bob gets priority. Bob can activate Orim.

If Bob activates Orim, it goes on stack above Kindle #1.

Stack: Orim's ability, Kindle #1.

Orim's ability resolves: Prevention shield of 3.

Kindle #1 resolves:
- Check X: 2 + 1 = 3 (Kindle #2 is in graveyard)
- Deals 3 damage, prevented by shield, 0 damage.

Orim survives with 2 damage marked.

Can Alice kill Orim?

Only if Bob makes a mistake and doesn't activate Orim, or activates at the wrong time.

If Bob activates Orim before any Kindles resolve (in response to Kindle #2):
- Prevention shield 3
- Kindle #2 deals 2, 2 prevented, shield now 1
- Kindle #1 deals 3, 1 prevented, 2 damage gets through
- Orim survives with 2 damage

Still survives!

Wait, so Bob should activate after the first Kindle resolves, not before. That way he prevents all 3 from the second Kindle.

But in the sequential casting (cast #1, let resolve, cast #2), Bob can also activate after #1 resolves and before #2 resolves.

In both cases, Bob can set up a prevention shield that absorbs all 3 damage from the second Kindle.

Is there any way for Alice to kill Orim?

What if Alice casts Kindle #1, and Bob doesn't respond (saving the tap for later)? Then Kindle #1 resolves, deals 2 damage. Then Alice passes priority, Bob passes back (not activating), and... actually, Alice can just not cast the second Kindle? No, she wants to kill Orim.

After Kindle #1 resolves, Alice casts Kindle #2. Now Bob can respond by activating Orim. If he does, Kindle #2's 3 damage is prevented.

So Bob should always activate after the first damage but before the second.

The only way Alice wins is if Bob activates at the wrong time (before any damage), or not at all.

But the question asks for optimal play from both players. So assuming optimal play, Bob saves Orim.

Wait, I should double-check: can Bob activate Orim's ability after Kindle #2 resolves but before Kindle
