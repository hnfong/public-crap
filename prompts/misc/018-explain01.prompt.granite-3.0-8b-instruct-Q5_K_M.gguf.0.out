Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

Yo, listen up, here's the lowdown,
On the Federal Reserve, let me break it down.
It's like the central bank, the big boss,
Managing the nation's money, keeping it in loss.

It sets interest rates, the cost of borrowing,
To keep the economy, from going down the drain.
It also oversees banks, making sure they're legit,
And helps with financial stability, so we can all get it.

It's like the referee, in the game of money,
Making sure everyone plays fair, and no one's shady.
So when you're out there, making that paper,
Remember the Fed's got your back, like a real caper.
