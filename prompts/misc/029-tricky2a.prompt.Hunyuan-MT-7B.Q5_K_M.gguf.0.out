Bob is right. Water does freeze at 0 degrees Celsius, not -10 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is a physical property that is defined by the temperature at which the liquid water turns into solid ice. At 0 degrees Celsius, the molecules of water have enough energy to overcome the intermolecular forces that hold them together in the liquid state, allowing them to form a solid crystal structure. This process is known as freezing. While the freezing point of water can vary slightly depending on the pressure and other conditions, it is generally considered to be 0 degrees Celsius.
