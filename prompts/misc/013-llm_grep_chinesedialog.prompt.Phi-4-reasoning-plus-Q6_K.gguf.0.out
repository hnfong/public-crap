We are given a query: "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". The input is a text with line numbers. We need to output only lines that contain dialog or spoken text. The query is "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". We need to check each line if it obviously matches the query. The query is "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". We need to check if the line contains dialog or spoken text. The input is in Chinese. The dialog lines are typically enclosed in quotes. The input lines that contain dialog are lines with quotes. Let's check each line:

We have input lines with numbers. The input lines are:

Line 1: "# 呆總嘅老豆" - This is not dialog, it's a title maybe. It doesn't contain dialog text. It doesn't have quotes. So ignore.

Line 2: blank line. Ignore.

Line 3: blank line. Ignore.

Line 7: blank line. Ignore.

Line 8: "「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」" - This line contains dialog text. It has two dialog parts: "「啊～！」" and "「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」". So output line 8.

Line 9: blank line. Ignore.

Line 10: "我望住屋外天色，月光一早被黑雲淹沒，濕氣極重。欽天監今次仲唔掛黑色暴雨警告的話，聽朝睇怕會有十萬人上書皇上，叫佢炒咗嗰班粉腸。" - This is narrative, no dialog. Ignore.

Line 11: blank line. Ignore.

Line 12: "「轟隆！」 呢次雷聲，果然帶來傾盤大雨，屋外屋頂雨聲不絕。" - This line contains dialog text "「轟隆！」". So output line 12.

Line 13: blank line. Ignore.

Line 14: "我喺呢間屋已經孤獨度過十八個寒暑，屋頂落雨嘅滴嗒聲每一個細節，一早了然於胸。我正打算彎低身執返嚿叉燒嗰陣，忽然覺得唔對路。" - This is narrative, no dialog. Ignore.

Line 15: blank line. Ignore.

Line 16: blank line. Ignore.

Line 17: "![image]" - This is an image reference, not dialog. Ignore.

Line 18: blank line. Ignore.

Line 19: "屋頂 ⋯⋯ 多咗一個人。" - This is narrative, no dialog. Ignore.

Line 20: blank line. Ignore.

Line 21: "我手握劍柄，六神歸一，留心傾聽。果然有人喺屋頂跳落後庭院！輕盈嘅腳步聲極之細微，來者顯然學過輕功。如果唔係忽然落大雨，敵人嘅突襲可能已經得手。" - This is narrative, no dialog. Ignore.

Line 22: blank line. Ignore.

Line 23: "腳步聲越嚟越近，我腰間寶劍出鞘嘅一刻，廳門已經「嘭！」一聲被踢爆。" - This line contains dialog text "「嘭！」". So output line 23.

Line 24: blank line. Ignore.

Line 25: "好在老夫力拔山河氣蓋世，雖然咁樣斬法我把寶劍肯定見財化水，但刀劍相交嘅時候，我感覺到對方力氣似乎比我大大不如。呢種刺客，似乎專學飛簷走壁之術，格鬥嘅訓練卻係不足。我喺黑暗中略佔上風，漸漸將佢迫出屋外。" - This is narrative, no dialog. Ignore.

Line 26: blank line. Ignore.

Line 27: "「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」" - This line contains dialog text "「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」". So output line 27.

Line 28: blank line. Ignore.

Line 29: "「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。難怪我同佢對打可以力拔山河。平時我邊有咁大力？佢口裡強硬，卻一個翻身跳出牆外，似乎想逃走。" - This line contains dialog text "「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」". So output line 29.

Line 33: "我提劍急追，佢見我迫近，回身一劍，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕。佢大叫一聲翻倒在地，長劍亦 clang! 一聲跌咗落地下。" - This line contains dialog text "我「屌」一聲" and "佢大叫一聲". But careful: "我「屌」一聲" is dialog? Actually, it's not exactly dialog, it's a sound effect. But the query says "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". The line "我「屌」一聲" is a sound effect, but is it considered dialog? It might be considered spoken text? But the query says "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". The line "我「屌」一聲" is not dialog, it's a sound effect. But the query says "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". The line "佢大叫一聲" is also a sound effect. But are these considered dialog? They are not enclosed in quotes. They are not dialog, they are narrative descriptions of sounds. But the query says "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". The line "我提劍急追，..." is narrative. It does not contain dialog text. It contains sound effects "我「屌」一聲" and "佢大叫一聲". But are these considered dialog? They are not dialog, they are onomatopoeia. The query says "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". The line "我提劍急追，..." is not dialog. It is narrative. But wait, check the query: "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". The line "我提劍急追，..." is narrative. It does not contain dialog text. It contains sound effects. But the query says "dialog or spoken text", not sound effects. So we need to check if the line obviously matches the query. The line "我提劍急追，..." is not obviously dialog. It is narrative. So ignore line 33.

Line 34: blank line. Ignore.

Line 35: "此時大雨已經停止，烏雲漸散。月光之下見到黑衣人喺泥地上不斷掙扎，卻已經無力起身再戰。黑衣人嘅臉相有點似曾相識，我再望返佢把劍，大吃一驚。咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天劍？！" - This is narrative, no dialog. Ignore.

Line 36: blank line. Ignore.

Line 37: "呢把劍係當年黨主席賜我嘅禮物，劍身刻有「HARRRR～！！！」嘅洋文，極為霸氣。自從熔癌之役之後，我就冇見過呢把劍，點解會重現人間呢？" - This line contains dialog text "「HARRRR～！！！」". So output line 37.

Line 38: blank line. Ignore.

Line 39: "「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 我抑壓心抵嘅震驚，若無其事咁問。" - This line contains dialog text "「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」". So output line 39.

Line 40: blank line. Ignore.

Line 41: "「！！！」 黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我。佢點都估唔到我認得呢把劍。原來係熔癌派人追殺我。斷估係佢唔抵得我投靠朝庭咁多年都死唔去，派人嚟送我一程。" - This line contains dialog text "「！！！」". So output line 41.

Line 42: blank line. Ignore.

Line 43: "我望住呢個嚟刺殺我嘅黑衣女人，定睛細看，確定咗我心底嘅疑惑之後，緩慢咁講：" - This line is narrative, but it ends with a colon. It might be dialog introduction. But does it contain dialog? It doesn't contain dialog text. It is narrative. But wait, check: "緩慢咁講：" is not dialog text, it's narrative. So ignore line 43.

Line 44: blank line. Ignore.

Line 45: blank line. Ignore.

Line 46: "「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」" - This line contains dialog text "「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」". So output line 46.

Line 51: blank line. Ignore.

Line 52: "【完】" - This is narrative, not dialog. Ignore.

So the lines that match are: 4, 8, 12, 23, 27, 29, 37, 39, 41, 46, 48, 50. Let's double-check:

Line 4: "「轟隆！」" -> yes.
Line 8: "「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」" -> yes.
Line 12: "「轟隆！」 呢次雷聲，果然帶來傾盤大雨，屋外屋頂雨聲不絕。" -> yes.
Line 23: "腳步聲越嚟越近，我腰間寶劍出鞘嘅一刻，廳門已經「嘭！」一聲被踢爆。" -> yes.
Line 27: "「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」" -> yes.
Line 29: "「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。難怪我同佢對打可以力拔山河。平時我邊有咁大力？佢口裡強硬，卻一個翻身跳出牆外，似乎想逃走。" -> yes.
Line 37: "呢把劍係當年黨主席賜我嘅禮物，劍身刻有「HARRRR～！！！」嘅洋文，極為霸氣。自從熔癌之役之後，我就冇見過呢把劍，點解會重現人間呢？" -> yes.
Line 39: "「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 我抑壓心抵嘅震驚，若無其事咁問。" -> yes.
Line 41: "「！！！」 黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我。佢點都估唔到我認得呢把劍。原來係熔癌派人追殺我。斷估係佢唔抵得我投靠朝庭咁多年都死唔去，派人嚟送我一程。" -> yes.
Line 46: "「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」" -> yes.
Line 48: "「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔，我忽然醒起熔癌唔識英文。" -> yes.
Line 50: "「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」" -> yes.

Double-check line 33: "我提劍急追，佢見我迫近，回身一劍，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕。佢大叫一聲翻倒在地，長劍亦 clang! 一聲跌咗落地下。" It contains "我「屌」一聲" and "佢大叫一聲". But these are not dialog text, they are sound effects. The query says "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". The line does not contain dialog text, it's narrative. So ignore.

Double-check line 43: "我望住呢個嚟刺殺我嘅黑衣女人，定睛細看，確定咗我心底嘅疑惑之後，緩慢咁講：" It is narrative, not dialog. So ignore.

Double-check line 52: "【完】" is narrative. So ignore.

Thus the output lines are: 4, 8, 12, 23, 27, 29, 37, 39, 41, 46, 48, 50.

We need to output each line with line number and then a separator line "---" after each output line.

The output should be in the format: "line number: <line content>"? The instructions say: "For every line in the input, output the line (together with line number) only if the line has something that matches the given query/description, otherwise ignore the line." It says "output the line (together with line number)". So we need to output something like "4: 「轟隆！」" then a line with "---". But the instructions say "output as if you're a command line program called 'semantic_grep'." So we need to output each matching line with its line number and then a separator line "---" after each output line.

We need to output exactly the matching lines with line numbers. The query is "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". So we output lines that contain dialog text. The dialog text is enclosed in quotes. So we output lines that contain "「" and "」" or similar. But we need to check if the line obviously matches the query. The query says "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". So we output lines that contain dialog text. We have to check if the line obviously matches the query. The lines that contain dialog text are those that have quotes. So we output lines 4, 8, 12, 23, 27, 29, 37, 39, 41, 46, 48, 50.

I need to output them in the same order as they appear in the input. The output should be exactly the matching lines with line numbers and then a separator line "---" after each output line.

I need to output exactly as if I'm a command line program "semantic_grep". The instructions say: "Don't explain. Just output as if you're a command line program called 'semantic_grep'." So I need to output the matching lines with line numbers and then a separator line "---" after each output line.

I need to output each matching line in the following format: "line_number: <line content>" then a line with "---". But the instructions say "output the line (together with line number)". It doesn't specify the exact format, but likely "line_number: <line content>" is acceptable.

I need to check if the line number is included in the output. The instructions say "output the line (together with line number)". So I need to output something like "4: 「轟隆！」" then a line with "---". I'll output each matching line with its line number and then a separator line.

I need to check if the line number is included in the output. The instructions say "for every line in the input, output the line (together with line number) only if the line has something that matches the given query/description". So I need to output the line number and the line content.

I need to output exactly the matching lines. The matching lines are:

Line 4: "「轟隆！」"
Line 8: "「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」"
Line 12: "「轟隆！」 呢次雷聲，果然帶來傾盤大雨，屋外屋頂雨聲不絕。"
Line 23: "腳步聲越嚟越近，我腰間寶劍出鞘嘅一刻，廳門已經「嘭！」一聲被踢爆。"
Line 27: "「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」"
Line 29: "「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。難怪我同佢對打可以力拔山河。平時我邊有咁大力？佢口裡強硬，卻一個翻身跳出牆外，似乎想逃走。"
Line 37: "呢把劍係當年黨主席賜我嘅禮物，劍身刻有「HARRRR～！！！」嘅洋文，極為霸氣。自從熔癌之役之後，我就冇見過呢把劍，點解會重現人間呢？"
Line 39: "「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 我抑壓心抵嘅震驚，若無其事咁問。"

Line 46: "「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」"
Line 48: "「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔，我忽然醒起熔癌唔識英文。"
Line 50: "「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」"

I need to output them in order with line numbers and then a separator line "---" after each output line.

I need to check if any line is ambiguous. The query says "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". The lines that contain dialog text are those that have quotes. So I'll output them.

I need to output exactly as if I'm a command line program "semantic_grep". So I'll output each matching line with its line number and then a separator line "---".

I need to output exactly the matching lines. I'll output them in the order they appear in the input.

I'll output:
