Thank you for sharing these lyrics—they’re charming, whimsical, and full of a playful, slightly eerie warmth. Let’s dive into an interpretation that makes literal sense in a **fantastical setting**, as you requested.

### **Setting the Scene: A Forest Restaurant in a Magical World**

The song describes a **small, magical restaurant in the forest**—not just a place to eat, but a **crossroads or liminal space** between the living and the forgotten, or between time and memory. The tone is lighthearted and mischievous, like a trickster or a forest spirit inviting you to join a strange, sweet meal.

### **Interpretation: The Restaurant of Forgotten People and Things**

The **main story** is about a **restaurant that serves forgotten people**—or, more precisely, **people who have been forgotten**. It’s a place where **memory and food are intertwined**, and where **the forest itself remembers** what humans have lost.

Let’s break it down with a few key lines:

---

#### **First stanza:**
> ドングリを辿っても着きません  
> 森の小さなレストラン  
> 空っぽのポケットを弄って  
> 忘れた人から辿り着く  

- You can’t reach the restaurant by following acorns (a common forest path for animals or spirits).  
- You reach it by **fiddling with an empty pocket**—a sign of poverty, or of being lost.  
- You arrive by **following a forgotten person**—someone who has been erased from memory.

This suggests the restaurant is **only accessible to those who are lost or forgotten**, or to those who are with them.

---

#### **Second stanza:**
> 予約は一つもありません  
> 森の小さなレストラン  
> 空席だらけのランチ時  
> 小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる  

- No reservations.  
- Lunchtime is full of empty seats—**waiting for forgotten people**.  
- The birds laugh—**mischievous, knowing**.

The restaurant is **always there**, waiting for those who have been left behind. The birds are like **forest spirits** or **memory keepers**, watching over the place.

---

#### **Third stanza:**
> 真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根  
> メニューはおすすめ そればかり  
> 厨房の方から聞こえてる  
> バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ  

- Red paint on a tin roof—**bright, cheerful, but strange**.  
- The menu is all “recommended” (maybe **memory-based food**).  
- From the kitchen: **string and wind instruments**—music that **echoes memory**.

The food and music are **tied to memory**—each bite or note brings back something lost.

---

#### **Fourth stanza:**
> ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい  
> たらふく食べたらお眠りよ  
> それでは皆さんさようなら  
> 明日は明日で エトセトラ  

- Welcome, welcome.  
- Eat your fill, and you’ll sleep.  
- Goodbye, everyone. Tomorrow is tomorrow, and so on.

This is a **cycle**—the restaurant serves forgotten people, and when they eat, they **rest**. It’s not a place of death, but of **peace for those who have been left behind**.

---

#### **Fifth stanza:**
> 右から左へおおわらわ  
> 手乗りの子熊も踊り出す  
> カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル  
> リゾット デザートはありません  

- The place is in a **commotion**—people laughing, dancing.  
- A **tame cub** dances—**innocent, playful**.  
- The food is **fancy, worldly**—but no dessert.

The cub is a **symbol of innocence** in a place of forgotten people. The food is **luxurious**, but **incomplete**—like memory.

---

#### **Final stanza:**
> お墓の中まで届けましょう  
> 今宵は最後のフルコース  

- We’ll deliver it even to the grave.  
- Tonight is the **last full course**.

This is the **climax**—the restaurant serves **food to the dead** or to those who are **on the verge of being forgotten**. It’s a **final meal** for those who have been lost, and the restaurant **brings it to them**.

---

### **Putting It All Together: The Story**

The song tells the story of a **magical forest restaurant** that serves **forgotten people**—humans who have been erased from memory, or spirits who linger. The restaurant is a **place of rest and remembrance**, where the forest and its spirits (birds, cub) welcome the lost, feed them with food tied to memory, and give them peace.

The **mischievous tone** comes from the **playfulness of the forest**—it’s not cruel, but it’s **aware** of the forgotten, and it **invites them to be remembered** in its own way.

The **fantastical setting** is clear: a forest with talking birds, a tame cub, a restaurant that serves the dead, and food that echoes memory. It’s not metaphorical—it’s a **real place in a magical world**, where the line between the living and the forgotten is thin.

### **Possible Name for the Restaurant (if you wanted to add to the story):**  
**"The Forest’s Forgotten Table"** or **"The Red Tin Restaurant of Lost Hearts"**
