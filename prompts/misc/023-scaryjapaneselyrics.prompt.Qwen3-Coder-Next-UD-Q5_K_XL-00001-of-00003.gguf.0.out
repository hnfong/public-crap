This is a delightful and whimsical set of lyrics—rich with fairy-tale imagery and gentle absurdity. Let’s unpack the story *literally*, within a fantastical setting (as requested), while also acknowledging the playful, mischievous tone of the melody.

### 🌲 **The Literal Story: A Hidden Forest Restaurant That Serves the Departed**

In a deep, enchanted forest, there exists a tiny, unassuming restaurant—*not* marked on any map—accessible only by following acorns (*dōguri*) scattered along a hidden path. (Note: *“ドングリを辿っても着きません”* literally says “Even if you follow the acorns, you won’t arrive”—but in context, it’s a *teasing* misdirection: the acorns *do* lead, but only if you’re *meant* to find it… or perhaps only if you’re already *lost in the right way*.)

The restaurant is perpetually empty—no reservations, no customers—yet at lunchtime, it’s *still* empty, and birds flutter and *laugh* (perhaps at the absurdity of its solitude, or at the fact that it’s open but无人). The building has a bright red tin roof (*makkai na beni no sentaku*—vivid, almost cartoonish), and the menu? Only one item: *“おすすめ”* (the chef’s recommendation)—and it’s always the *same dish*, repeated endlessly on the board.

Inside, the kitchen is alive—not with sizzling pans, but with *music*: violin, flute, cello, viola. The chefs aren’t just cooking—they’re *performing* a string quartet while preparing food. This suggests the restaurant is run by spirits, or perhaps by nature itself, personified as musicians.

Then comes the invitation:  
**“ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい / たらふく食べたらお眠りよ”**  
→ “Welcome, welcome, please come in / After you’ve eaten your fill, you may sleep.”

Ah—here’s the twist: *“お眠り”* (o nemuri) doesn’t *only* mean “take a nap.” In poetic or euphemistic Japanese, it can mean *to pass away peacefully*, especially in folkloric contexts (e.g., *“眠りにつく”* as a gentle euphemism for death).

The next verse confirms it:  
**“それでは皆さんさようなら / 明日は明日で エトセトラ”**  
→ “Well then, everyone—goodbye / Tomorrow is tomorrow, et cetera…”  
This is a *funereal* farewell—nonchalant, almost cheerful, like a host dismissing guests after a banquet, knowing they won’t return *today*… or ever again.

Then:  
**“右から左へおおわらわ / 手乗りの子熊も踊り出す”**  
→ “A great commotion—right to left— / Even a palm-sized cub begins to dance.”  
This evokes a *procession*—perhaps souls moving in a circle or a line, guided by a small bear (a *kuma no ko*, possibly a *komainu*-like guardian or forest spirit). The bear dancing with them suggests a joyful, sacred rite.

The menu items—*carpaccio, paella, appetizers, risotto*—are elegant, but then:  
**“デザートはありません”**  
→ “There is no dessert.”  
A poignant omission—because *dessert* (sweetness, continuation, afterlife comfort) is unnecessary… or forbidden.

Finally, the climax:  
**“お墓の中まで届けましょう / 今宵は最後のフルコース”**  
→ “Let us deliver it all the way into the grave / Tonight is the final full-course meal.”

### 🍽️ **Interpretation: The Last Supper for the Departed**

The restaurant is a *liminal space*—a waystation between life and death, hidden in the forest (a traditional Japanese symbol of the sacred and the unknown). It serves *only* to those who have passed—or are about to pass—and the meal is their *final feast* before resting eternally.

- The empty tables? Because only the *departed* can truly sit and eat.
- The birds laughing? Perhaps *kappa* or *tengu* spirits mocking the solemnity—or celebrating liberation.
- The kitchen musicians? The *sound of the universe*—or ancestral spirits preparing the food with artistry and reverence.
- The bear dancing? A *shinto guardian* (like a *komainu* or *kuma no kami*) guiding souls.
- “No dessert”? Because in death, there is no *after*—only peace.

The mischievous melody fits: this isn’t a grim place—it’s *warm*, *humorous*, *generous*. The host is kind, even playful, offering abundance before the long sleep. It’s not a tragedy—it’s a *celebration* of transition.

### 🌟 Bonus: Literal, Non-Fantastical Reading (Just in Case)

If we take it *more groundedly*, the restaurant could be a real but forgotten, nearly abandoned café in a remote forest—run by an eccentric old chef who only serves one dish, plays music while cooking, and whose regulars are mostly elderly locals or lost hikers. The “last course” could be a metaphor for a *quiet retirement* or *final meal*—but the lyrics lean too heavily into the supernatural (tombs, dancing bears, no dessert *as a rule*) for this to be the primary reading.

In short: **It’s a fairy-tale funeral banquet in the woods—where the forest itself hosts a final, lavish meal for those ready to rest.**  
And the birds are laughing *with* them, not *at* them. 🐻🎶🍂
