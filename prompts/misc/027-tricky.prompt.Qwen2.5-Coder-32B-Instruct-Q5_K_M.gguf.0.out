A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. At -12 degrees Celsius, water would be well below its freezing point and would be in a solid (ice) state if it had already frozen.

B) If you have a glass of pure water and cool it down to -12 degrees Celsius, the water would have already frozen into ice at 0 degrees Celsius. Therefore, at -12 degrees Celsius, the glass would contain ice, not liquid water. The ice would remain solid at this temperature. [end of text]
