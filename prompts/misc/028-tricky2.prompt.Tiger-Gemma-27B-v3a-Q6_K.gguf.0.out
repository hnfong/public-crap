Bob is technically right, but in a misleading way. 

While Alice is correct that *pure* water freezes at 0°C, water *can* freeze at -10°C if it's not pure – for example, if it contains salt (like seawater). Bob didn't specify pure water, so his statement isn't *wrong*, just incomplete. 

It's a bit of a trick question designed to highlight the importance of context in scientific statements. [end of text]
