Here are the answers with brief explanations:

### A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?

**No**

* **Freezing Point of Water**: Pure water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (°C) at standard atmospheric pressure.
* **Temperature Given**: -12°C is 12 degrees below the freezing point of water.
* **Implication**: While water does not freeze at -12°C in the sense that it hasn't reached its freezing point yet, if water were cooled to this temperature, it would have already frozen, as it would have passed through the 0°C threshold.

### B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?

**It Freezes (but with a nuanced explanation)**

* **Initial Cooling (Down to 0°C)**: As the water is cooled from its initial temperature (assumed to be above 0°C) to 0°C, its temperature decreases, but no phase change occurs until it reaches 0°C.
  
* **At 0°C**: At this point, the water starts to freeze. Latent heat of fusion is released as the water transitions from liquid to solid (ice), but the temperature remains at 0°C until all the water has frozen, assuming the cooling continues.

* **Cooling Below 0°C (to -12°C)**:
  - **If the water fully freezes at 0°C** before the temperature drops below 0°C, then cooling it further to -12°C will simply lower the temperature of the ice to -12°C.
  - **Supercooling Scenario**: In some cases, pure water can be **supercooled** below 0°C without freezing. If this happens and then the temperature reaches -12°C:
    - **Eventually Freezes**: The water will freeze rapidly at some point below 0°C (the exact temperature can vary, but it's typically well above -12°C for pure water in a glass). Once frozen, the ice will then be cooled to -12°C.

* **Outcome at -12°C**: Regardless of the path, at -12°C, the state of the water will be **solid (ice)**, and its temperature will be -12°C.

**Practical Outcome for Your Glass of Water**:
- **Likely Scenario**: The water will freeze at or slightly below 0°C (if supercooled) and then the ice will cool to -12°C.
- **Observation**: You would observe ice at -12°C, not liquid water. [end of text]
