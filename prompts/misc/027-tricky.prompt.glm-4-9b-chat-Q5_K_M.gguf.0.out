A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. Below this temperature, water will remain in a liquid state unless it is under extreme pressure, which can lower the freezing point.

B) If a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will not freeze immediately. However, as the temperature continues to drop below 0 degrees Celsius, the water will start to freeze. The freezing process will occur as the water molecules slow down and form ice crystals. If the water is not disturbed, it will eventually freeze completely into ice at 0 degrees Celsius. [end of text]
