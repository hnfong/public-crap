A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. If water is cooled to -12 degrees Celsius, it will remain in the liquid state because it has not reached its freezing point.

B) If a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will start to freeze. As the temperature approaches the freezing point of water (0 degrees Celsius), the water molecules slow down and begin to form a crystalline structure, which is the process of freezing. The water will turn into ice at -12 degrees Celsius, assuming the pressure remains constant. However, it's important to note that the exact freezing point can vary slightly with changes in pressure.
