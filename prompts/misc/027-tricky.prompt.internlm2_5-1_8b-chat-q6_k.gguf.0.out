A) Yes, water can indeed freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. This is a common temperature range for freezing in the context of water, which is a liquid at standard atmospheric pressure. When water reaches this temperature, it begins to change phase from liquid to solid (ice) under the influence of heat.

B) If you have a glass of pure water and you cool it down to -12 degrees Celsius, the water will start to freeze. This process is known as freezing. As the water temperature drops below -12 degrees Celsius, the water molecules slow down and begin to arrange themselves into a crystalline structure, forming ice. The ice will then solidify and become a solid block of ice. This process is a physical change of state, where the substance changes from a liquid to a solid. The water will remain in a solid state at -12 degrees Celsius, but it will not turn into ice. [end of text]
