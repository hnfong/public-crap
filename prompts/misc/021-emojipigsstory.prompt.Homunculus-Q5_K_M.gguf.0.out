Sure! Here's a story about the **three little pigs**, told entirely in emoji:

**Once upon a time**, 🐷 🐷 🐷  
Three little pigs 🐖 were born in a cozy forest 🌲.  
They were siblings, but each had a different personality.  

The first pig 🐷 was **lazy** and loved to sleep 🛌.  
He built his house out of **straw** 🌾.  
It looked nice, but it was **weak** 🤕.  

The second pig 🐷 was **careless** and loved to play 🎮.  
He built his house out of **sticks** 🪵.  
It looked fun, but it was **not strong** 🤯.  

The third pig 🐷 was **smart** and loved to work 🧱.  
He built his house out of **bricks** 🧱.  
It looked tough, but it was **very strong** 💪.  

One day, a big bad wolf 🐺 came to visit.  
He huffed and he puffed 🐺💨, trying to blow down the houses.  

He blew down the straw house 🌾💨.  
Then he blew down the stick house 🪵💨.  
But when he tried to blow down the brick house 🧱💨,  
It stood strong 💪.  

The wolf got angry 🐺😡 and tried to break in.  
But the brick house was too strong 🧱.  
The pigs laughed 🤣 and called the wolf a **big baby** 🐺👶.  

The wolf ran away 🐺💨 and never came back.  
The pigs lived happily ever after 🐷🎉.  
And the moral of the story is:  
**Work hard, be smart, and build strong** 💪.
