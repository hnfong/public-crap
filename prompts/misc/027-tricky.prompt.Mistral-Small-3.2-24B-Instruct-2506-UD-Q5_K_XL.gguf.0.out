A) Water does not typically freeze at -12 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. The standard freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). However, water can remain in a liquid state below its freezing point in a supercooled state, but this is not a stable condition and depends on various factors such as purity and the presence of nucleation sites.

B) If a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will likely remain in a liquid state initially, existing in a supercooled condition. However, this state is metastable, and the water can suddenly freeze if disturbed or if ice nucleation occurs. The exact behavior can depend on factors like the purity of the water, the rate of cooling, and the presence of any impurities or containers that might act as nucleation sites. If the water does freeze, it will release the latent heat of fusion, which may cause a slight temperature increase until the heat is dissipated. [end of text]
