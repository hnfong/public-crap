Okay, the user wants me to write a story about Snow White using only emojis, with no text at all. They mentioned the protagonist should resemble the classical tale but allow creativity. Let me start by recalling key elements from the original Snow White story: the princess with skin like snow, lips like blood, hair like ebony; the evil queen; the magic mirror; the seven dwarfs; the poisoned apple; the prince; the glass coffin.

Hmm, need to convey all that with emojis only. First, establish Snow White's appearance: 👩‍🦳 for white skin? Wait, that's an older woman. Maybe 👩 for a woman, but need to show pale skin. 🍎 for the apple, but that's later. Let's think step by step.

Start with the queen and mirror: 👸🔮👩‍🦳? No, the queen is the stepmother. Maybe 👑👩 for queen, then 🪞 for mirror. The mirror says she's not fairest: 👑👩❓👩‍🦳? But Snow White is the fairest. Need to show the queen's jealousy.

Then Snow White in the forest: 🌲🏃‍♀️➡️🏠. The dwarfs' cottage: 🏠⛏️👷‍♂️👷‍♂️👷‍♂️👷‍♂️👷‍♂️👷‍♂️👷‍♂️. That's seven dwarfs. But how to show they're dwarfs? Maybe use 👷‍♂️ for miner, but that's not specific. Could use 🧔 for beard, but all dwarfs have beards. Maybe repeat the dwarf emoji seven times.

Poisoned apple: 🍎☠️. The queen disguised as old woman: 👵🍎. Snow White eats it: 👩🍎💤. Glass coffin: 🪟💤👩. Prince wakes her: 👑👩💋👩. Happily ever after: 💍👩👑.

Wait, need to sequence it properly. Start with queen and mirror, then Snow White fleeing, meeting dwarfs, queen's attempts, apple, sleep, prince, revival. Also, the huntsman? Original has huntsman sparing her. Maybe include that: 🏹👨‍🦳❌👩. But emoji for huntsman? 🏹 is bow, 👨‍🦳 is old man? Not accurate. Maybe skip huntsman to keep it simple.

Check emoji availability: 🪞 is mirror, but some platforms might not support. Use 🔍? No, that's magnifying glass. Maybe just use 🪞 if available. Alternatively, use 💬 for talking mirror? But mirror is key.

Let's draft sequence:

1. Queen asks mirror: 👑👩🪞❓👩‍🦳? But Snow White isn't old. Need to show "fairest". Maybe 👑👩🪞🗣️"❌👩‍🦳"👩? Too vague.

Better: 👑👩🔮👀👩‍🦳? No. Use 👑👩🪞🗣️"👩‍🦳👄🩸💇‍♀️🖤"👑❌. That's messy.

Simplify: 👑👩🪞🗣️"👩‍🦳"👑😡. Then 👑👩➡️🏹👨‍🦳🍎❌. Huntsman spares her: 🏹👨‍🦳👩🏃‍♀️➡️🌲.

Then 🌲🏃‍♀️➡️🏠⛏️7️⃣👷‍♂️. Dwarfs find her: 👷‍♂️👀👩😴? No, she's awake initially. She cleans house: 🧹🏠👩. Queen finds out: 👑👩🪞🗣️"👩‍🦳"👑😡👵🍎➡️🏠.

Poison apple: 👵🍎👩🍎💤. Dwarfs put in glass coffin: 🪟💤👩. Prince: 👑👩💋👩👀👩💤➡️👩👀. Happily ever after: 💍👩👑.

But need to show the "skin like snow, lips like blood, hair like ebony". Maybe at the beginning: 👩‍🦳👄🩸💇‍♀️🖤. But 👩‍🦳 is old woman emoji. That's problematic. The woman emoji with white hair? Actually, 👩 is generic woman. To show pale skin, maybe use 🤍 for white? But that's a heart. Or 🍚 for rice? No.

Maybe use 👩 with 🍦? No. Emoji for pale skin? There's no direct emoji. Could use 👩 with 🤍 as modifier? But emojis don't combine like that. Perhaps use 👩 and then 🍎 for red lips? But lips are red, apple is red. Not good.

Alternative: Use 👩 and then 🩸 for blood? But that's blood drop. 👄🩸 for red lips. Hair black: 💇‍♀️🖤? 💇‍♀️ is haircut, 🖤 is black heart. Not ideal.

Maybe skip physical description and rely on context. The mirror says she's fairest, so that implies her beauty.

Let's try a sequence:

👑👩🪞🗣️"👩‍🦳"👑😡  
🏹👨‍🦳👩🏃‍♀️➡️🌲  
🌲👩➡️🏠⛏️7️⃣👷‍♂️  
🧹🏠👩  
👑👩🪞🗣️"👩‍🦳"👑😡👵🍎➡️🏠  
👩🍎💤  
🪟💤👩  
👑👩💋👩👀👩💤➡️👩👀  
💍👩👑

But "👩‍🦳" is old woman, which is wrong for Snow White. Need an emoji for young woman. 👩 is woman, but age ambiguous. Maybe use 👧 for girl? Snow White is young, but not a child. 👩 is better.

Perhaps use 👩 and then 🍦 for snow? No. Or use ❄️ for snow? But that's snowflake. Could do 👩❄️👄🍎💇‍♀️⚫ but that's not standard.

Maybe the user expects creative use, so I can use 👩 and then add ❄️ nearby to imply snow-white skin. But emojis are linear, so 👩❄️👄🍎💇‍♀️⚫ might work.

But the rule is exclusively emoji, no text, so I have to convey with emojis only. Let's try:

❄️👩🍎👄⚫💇‍♀️  
👑👩🪞🗣️"❄️👩🍎👄⚫💇‍♀️"👑😡  
🏹👨‍🦳❌👩🏃‍♀️➡️🌲  
🌲❄️👩➡️🏠⛏️👷‍♂️👷‍♂️👷‍♂️👷‍♂️👷‍♂️👷‍♂️👷‍♂️  
🧹🏠👩  
👑👩🪞🗣️"❄️👩🍎👄⚫💇‍♀️"👑😡👵🍎➡️🏠  
❄️👩🍎💤  
🪟💤❄️👩  
👑👩💋❄️👩👀❄️👩💤➡️❄️👩👀  
💍❄️👩👑

But that's repetitive. Maybe simplify description at start, then use 👩 for Snow White after introduction.

Better: Start with the queen and mirror, then Snow White's description as part of the mirror's statement.

👑👩🪞🗣️"👩❄️👄🍎💇‍♀️⚫"👑😡  
🏹👨‍🦳👩🏃‍♀️➡️🌲  
🌲👩➡️🏠⛏️7️⃣👷‍♂️  
🧹🏠👩  
👑👩🪞🗣️"👩❄️👄🍎💇‍♀️⚫"👑😡👵🍎➡️🏠  
👩🍎💤  
🪟💤👩  
👑👩💋👩👀👩💤➡️👩👀  
💍👩👑

But "👩❄️👄🍎💇‍♀️⚫" is messy. Maybe use 👩 and then separate emojis for attributes: 👩❄️👄❤️💇‍♀️⚫. ❤️ for red lips? But apple is also red. Use 🩸 for blood? But that's blood drop. 🍎 is apple, which is red, but for lips? Not ideal.

Perhaps use 👩 and then 🍎 for red lips? But that might confuse with the apple. Better to use 👄❤️ for red lips. But ❤️ is heart, not necessarily red lips. But in emoji storytelling, it might be understood.

Let's try: 👩❄️👄❤️💇‍♀️⚫

But ❄️ for snow-white skin? That could work. ❄️ is snowflake, so 👩❄️ might mean snow-white woman. 👄❤️ for red lips. 💇‍♀️ for hair, ⚫ for black.

So: 👩❄️👄❤️💇‍♀️⚫

Then mirror says that's the fairest.

Now, the huntsman: 🏹👨‍🦳. 👨‍🦳 is old man, but huntsman might not be old. Maybe use 🏹👤? 👤 is silhouette. But 🏹👤 might not be clear. Could use 🏹🐺? No, huntsman hunts, but here he spares her. Maybe skip huntsman and just have her run to forest.

Original has huntsman take her to forest, but he spares her. So: 👑👩➡️🏹👤👩➡️🌲. But 🏹👤 is bow and silhouette, not clear.

Perhaps use 🏹👨 for man with bow. 👨 is man. So 🏹👨👩➡️🌲. But that might mean man with bow and woman go to forest.

Better: 👑👩🏹👨👩➡️🌲. But order matters. Maybe 👑👩➡️🏹👨👩➡️🌲.

But to save emojis, maybe combine: 👑👩🏹👨➡️🌲👩. But that's messy.

I think for simplicity, skip huntsman and have queen order her death, she flees: 👑👩🗣️🏹👨❌👩👩🏃‍♀️➡️🌲. But 🗣️ is speaking, not order. Use 👑👩➡️🏹👨🗣️"❌👩"👩🏃‍♀️➡️🌲. Too many.

Maybe: 👑👩😡🏹👨👩➡️🌲. But that doesn't show sparing.

Given the constraint, perhaps it's okay to simplify. Many emoji stories skip minor details.

Let's finalize a sequence:

1. Queen and mirror: 👑👩🪞🗣️"👩❄️👄❤️💇‍♀️⚫"👑😡
2. Huntsman spares her: 🏹👨👩➡️🌲 (but this implies he takes her to forest, which is correct)
3. In forest: 🌲👩➡️🏠⛏️👷‍♂️👷‍♂️👷‍♂️👷‍♂️👷‍♂️👷‍♂️👷‍♂️
4. Dwarfs return: 👷‍♂️👀👩🧹🏠😊
5. Queen discovers: 👑👩🪞🗣️"👩❄️👄❤️💇‍♀️⚫"👑😡👵🍎➡️🏠
6. Apple: 👩🍎💤
7. Glass coffin: 🪟💤👩
8. Prince: 👑👩💋👩👀👩💤➡️👩👀
9. Happy end: 💍👩👑

But need to show dwarfs are seven. Use 7️⃣👷‍♂️? But 7️⃣ is number seven, then 👷‍♂️. So ⛏️7️⃣👷‍♂️? Or 🏠⛏️7️⃣👷‍♂️.

Also, the queen's disguise: 👵 for old woman. So 👵🍎➡️🏠.

Now, for the prince waking her: 👑👩💋👩 might mean prince kisses woman, but which woman? Use 👑👩💋👩❄️? But we have 👩 for Snow White already. Maybe use 👑👩💋👩💤➡️👩👀. But 💤➡️👀 might not be clear. Use 👑👩💋👩👀👩💤? No.

Perhaps: 👑👩💋👩💤➡️👀👩. But that's awkward.

Better: 👑👩💋👩👀👩💤👀. But that's repetitive.

Maybe: 👑👩💋👩💤➡️👩👀. The arrow might imply transition.

But emojis don't have arrows in standard set? ➡️ is right arrow, available.

So: 👑👩💋👩💤➡️👩👀

Then she wakes.

Finally, 💍👩👑 for marriage and queen.

But we need to show they live happily ever after. Maybe 👑👩🏠😊💕.

But 💍 implies marriage.

Let's put it all together:

👑👩🪞🗣️"👩❄️👄❤️💇‍♀️⚫"👑😡  
🏹👨👩➡️🌲  
🌲👩➡️🏠⛏️7️⃣👷‍♂️  
👷‍♂️👀👩🧹🏠😊  
👑👩🪞🗣️"👩❄️👄❤️💇‍♀️⚫"👑😡👵🍎➡️🏠  
👩🍎💤  
🪟💤👩  
👑👩💋👩💤➡️👩👀  
💍👩👑

But the dwarfs finding her: 👷‍♂️👀👩🧹🏠😊. That shows dwarfs see woman cleaning house and are happy.

Then queen discovers again, sends apple.

But the queen asks mirror again after huntsman? In original, she asks again after thinking Snow White is dead. So after dwarfs, queen asks mirror and finds out Snow White is alive. So sequence: queen asks mirror first, then huntsman, then dwarfs, then queen asks again, then apple.

So:

1. 👑👩🪞🗣️"👩❄️👄❤️💇‍♀️⚫"👑😡  
2. 👑👩➡️🏹👨👩➡️🌲  
3. 🌲👩➡️🏠⛏️7️⃣👷‍♂️  
4. 👷‍♂️👀👩🧹🏠😊  
5. 👑👩🪞🗣️"👩❄️👄❤️💇‍♀️⚫"👑😡  
6. 👵🍎➡️🏠  
7. 👩🍎💤  
8. 🪟💤👩  
9. 👑👩💋👩💤➡️👩👀  
10. 💍👩👑

But step 2: 👑👩➡️🏹👨👩➡️🌲. That might mean queen goes to huntsman and woman to forest. Better: 👑👩🗣️🏹👨"❌👩"👩🏃‍♀️➡️🌲. But 🗣️ is speaking, and "❌👩" is no woman? Not clear.

Maybe: 👑👩😡🏹👨👩➡️🌲. But that doesn't show sparing.

Perhaps use 🏹👨👩➡️🌲 to mean huntsman takes woman to forest, implying he spared her.

I think it's acceptable.

Now, for the glass coffin: 🪟 is window, but glass coffin is like a coffin made of glass. 🪟 might be used for glass. Or use 💎 for crystal? But 💎 is gem. 🪟 is window, which is glass, so might work.

Alternatively, use 🏺 for vase? No.

🪟 is probably best.

Finally, the end: 💍👩👑. But 👑 is crown, so woman with crown and ring? 💍👩👑 means ring woman crown, which might imply she becomes queen.

But we need prince too. 👑👩 is prince and woman? 👑 is crown, 👩 is woman. Prince is man with crown? 👑👨? But 👨 is man. So 👑👨 for prince. Then 👑👨💋👩.

So step 9: 👑👨💋👩💤➡️👩👀

Then step 10: 💍👩👑

But 👩 is Snow White, 👑👨 is prince.

So adjust:

👑👩🪞🗣️"👩❄️👄❤️💇‍♀️⚫"👑😡  
👑👩➡️🏹👨👩➡️🌲  
🌲👩➡️🏠⛏️7️⃣👷‍♂️  
👷‍♂️👀👩🧹🏠😊  
👑👩🪞🗣️"👩❄️👄❤️💇‍♀️⚫"👑😡  
👵🍎➡️🏠  
👩🍎💤  
🪟💤👩  
👑👨💋👩
