Okay, let's break down the story told by these lyrics.

**Interpretation:**

The lyrics tell the story of a **small, magical, and perhaps dying restaurant hidden deep within a forest.**

1.  **The Elusive Location:** The restaurant is incredibly hard to find, even if you follow an acorn (a natural forest guide). This suggests it's not bound by normal rules of location.
2.  **The Empty State:** It's perpetually empty. There are no reservations, it's full of empty seats even during lunchtime, and there's no dessert on the menu (a sign of poverty or finality). The only "customers" seem to be birds, who mockingly flap and laugh at the emptiness.
3.  **The Atmosphere:** Despite being empty, it has a distinct, slightly dated charm: a bright red tin roof, a menu with only "recommendations" (implying very little variety or perhaps just one thing), and a surprisingly sophisticated classical music ensemble playing from the kitchen. This creates a strange contrast between poverty (empty pockets, empty seats) and refinement (classical music, specific dishes mentioned).
4.  **The Host and the Offer:** The host (perhaps the owner, maybe a ghost or spirit) welcomes anyone who finds it. The offer is simple: eat your fill, then sleep. It's a place of rest and finality.
5.  **The Farewell:** The host bids everyone goodbye, acknowledging that tomorrow is another day ("et cetera"), implying this meal and rest is a one-time, definitive event.
6.  **The Mischief and Finality:** The description of the host moving frantically ("right to left, oh woe is me") and a pet bear cub dancing suggests a sense of frantic energy or perhaps desperation mixed with the magical, mischievous tone. The specific dishes mentioned (Carpaccio, Paella, Risotto) are European, adding another layer of strangeness in a forest setting. The most striking line is the host's wish: "Let's deliver this all the way to the graves." This strongly suggests the restaurant is a place for the final meal before death, or perhaps a place visited by spirits or those about to pass on. The "final full course" reinforces this idea of an ending.

**Literal Sense in a Fantastical Setting:**

In a literal fantastical sense, this could be:
*   A restaurant run by spirits or ghosts for other spirits, or for the living who are about to die.
*   A place located in a pocket dimension or a liminal space within the forest, accessible only under specific, perhaps dying, conditions.
*   The "forest restaurant" could be a metaphorical representation of the afterlife or a final resting place, where the "meal" is the final experience before passing on, and the music is the last sounds heard. The empty pockets and lack of reservations fit the idea of arriving with nothing and having no prior plans in this final state. The mischievous tone might come from the spirits running the place, or the absurdity of the situation itself. [end of text]
