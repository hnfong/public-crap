<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer: Who is right? Explanation: Water freezes at 0°C under normal conditions. At -10°C, water is solid (ice). So Bob's statement "Water freezes at -10°C" is incorrect. But Bob says "Yes, but I'm still right." That is contradictory. So Alice is correct. But we need to explain briefly. Also mention that water can remain liquid below 0°C if supercooled, but at -10°C it's ice. So answer: Alice is right. Provide explanation.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Alice is right.**

- Under normal atmospheric pressure, pure water freezes at **0 °C**.  
- At –10 °C the temperature is well below the freezing point, so any liquid water present will have already turned into ice (unless it is super‑cooled, which is a special, metastable state that is not the usual case).  
- Bob’s claim that “water freezes at –10 °C” is incorrect; the freezing point is 0 °C, not –10 °C.  

So Alice’s statement is the correct one. [end of text]
