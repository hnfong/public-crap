<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer: Who is right? The conversation: Alice says "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" Bob says "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius." Alice says "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius." Bob says "Yes, but I'm still right."

We need to explain who is right. The question: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" The answer: Water will freeze (solidify) at 0 degrees Celsius under normal conditions. At -10 degrees Celsius, water will be in solid state (ice). So Bob's statement "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius" is incorrect. Alice's statement "water freezes at 0 degrees celsius" is correct. Bob's final statement "Yes, but I'm still right" is not correct. So Alice is right. But we need to explain briefly. The explanation: Under standard atmospheric pressure, water freezes at 0°C. At -10°C, water is already frozen. So Bob's statement is wrong. So answer: Alice is right. Provide explanation.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Alice is right.**  

Under normal atmospheric pressure water freezes (turns into ice) at **0 °C**.  
At –10 °C the water is already solid; it has frozen long before it reaches –10 °C.  
So Bob’s claim that “water freezes at –10 °C” is incorrect, while Alice’s statement that it freezes at 0 °C is correct. [end of text]
