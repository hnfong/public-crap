Here is a set of 8 evaluations for LLMs, ranging from easy to difficult, incorporating your specific constraints.

**Q1 (Easy - Pop Culture):**
Which fictional superhero is famously known for his **zealous** defense of Gotham City?

*Possible Answer:*
Batman (Bruce Wayne).

**Q2 (Easy - Geography/Language):**
请列出三个以“平”字结尾的中国城市名称。

*Possible Answers:*
1. 北京 (Beijing) - 原名北平.
2. 南平.
3. 四平.
(Other valid answers: 太平, 延平, etc.)

**Q3 (Medium - Culinary Arts):**
If you were to **blanch** zucchini, what specific physical change should you look for to know the process is complete?

*Possible Answer:*
The zucchini should become bright green and slightly tender (fork-tender), but still retain a crisp texture (crunch). It should not be mushy.

**Q4 (Medium - Literature):**
在《红楼梦》中，贾宝玉梦游太虚幻境时，警幻仙子让他品尝了一种名为“千红一窟”的茶，请问这杯茶暗喻了书中女性角色怎样的**平**凡命运？

*Possible Answer:*
“千红一窟”谐音“千红一哭”，暗喻了书中所有女性角色（“万艳同杯”对应“万艳同悲”）最终悲剧、凄凉的结局。无论她们性格如何，最终都难逃命运的捉弄，或死或散，无法拥有平淡安稳的一生。

**Q5 (Medium-Hard - Logic/Riddle):**
I have cities, but no houses. I have mountains, but no trees. I have water, but no fish. I have roads, but no cars. What object am I? Please analyze the **puzzle** logically.

*Possible Answer:*
A map.
*Logic:* Maps depict geographical features like cities, mountains, and water bodies symbolically, but they are representations and lack the physical elements (houses, trees, fish, cars).

**Q6 (Hard - Physics/Engineering):**
Explain the **Zeeman** effect in simple terms and state its primary significance in the field of astrophysics.

*Possible Answer:*
*Explanation:* The Zeeman effect is the splitting of a spectral line into several components in the presence of a static magnetic field.
*Significance:* It allows astrophysicists to measure the magnetic fields of stars (like the Sun) and galaxies by observing the splitting of spectral lines in the light received from them.

**Q7 (Hard - History/Politics):**
请解释“平成”时代在日本历史中的具体时间跨度，并简述该时代结束后，日本政府为了应对地区安全挑战而做出的一个重大政策**平**衡调整（例如防卫预算或战略文件的变化）。

*Possible Answer:*
*Time Span:* The Heisei era spanned from January 8, 1989, to April 30, 2019.
*Policy Adjustment:* After the Heisei era ended (entering the Reiwa era), Japan significantly shifted its security policy. A major example is the approval of the "National Security Strategy" in late 2022, which plans to double the defense budget to 2% of GDP and acquire "counterstrike capabilities" (enemy base strike capability), breaking the long-standing post-war taboo of maintaining a strictly self-defense-only posture.

**Q8 (Very Hard - Creative Synthesis):**
Write a short, rhyming couplet (two lines) about a **zombie** apocalypse that also secretly hides a mathematical constant (like Pi or Phi) within the structure of the sentence syllables or word counts.

*Possible Answer:*
"**Zombies** rise, the world is lost,
Three point one four is the cost."
*(The second line contains the approximation of Pi: 3.14)*

*Alternative (Syllable based):*
"**Zombies** feast on brains and hearts," (7 syllables)
"Never ending, tearing parts." (7 syllables)
*(If the user considers 7 a lucky number or approximates Pi as 22/7, though the first example is more objectively clear).* [end of text]
