Yo, check it, let me break it down for you, straight from the streets to the beat:

The Fed, they run the show, yeah, they control the dough,
Printin' cash, keepin' the flow, makin' sure it don't go slow.
They set the rates, yo, that's the price to borrow,
High or low, they decide, keep the economy in a row.

When times are tough, they drop the rate,
Make it cheaper to borrow, help the economy elevate.
But when it's all good, they might crank it up,
Keep things from gettin' too hot, prevent a big flop.

They watch the banks, make sure they don't play rough,
Keep the money safe, no shady stuff.
And when the market's in a slump, they step in to save,
Inject some cash, make sure the economy behaves.

So the Fed's like the DJ, mixin' up the track,
Keepin' the rhythm steady, no sudden attack.
They spin the wheels, keep the economy on point,
With every move they make, they keep the nation joint.

Word up, that's the Fed, the backbone of the flow,
Keepin' the cash in the game, makin' sure it don't go. [end of text]
