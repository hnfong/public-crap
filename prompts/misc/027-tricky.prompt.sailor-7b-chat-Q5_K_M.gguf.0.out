A) No, water does not freeze at 12째C. It freezes at 0째C (32째F). 

B) When a glass of pure water is cooled down to 12째C, it will not freeze. However, the water molecules will slow down and move closer together, causing the water to become more dense. This will cause the water to form a solid, but it will not be a solid block of ice. Instead, it will form a solid sheet or a solid film on the surface of the glass. [end of text]
