If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

If a theory proves itself, it is typically considered "tautological" rather than "consistent." Consistency refers to the property of a theory that it does not prove both a statement and its negation. A tautological theory, on the other hand, is one where the statement being proved is always true, regardless of the interpretation of the symbols.

Here are some examples of tautological theories:

1. **Propositional Logic**: The theory of propositional logic is tautological because it is based on the principle of truth-functional tautology, which states that a compound proposition is true if and only if all of its component propositions are true.

2. **Classical Logic**: The theory of classical logic is tautological because it includes the law of excluded middle (a statement is either true or false) and the law of non-contradiction (a statement cannot be both true and false).

3. **Identity Theory**: The theory of identity, which states that every object is identical to itself, is tautological because it is a statement that is always true.

4. **Trivial Arithmetic**: The theory of arithmetic with only the axioms that state that 0 is a number and that 0 is the additive identity is tautological because it does not make any claims about the properties of numbers other than the trivial ones.

It's important to note that while these theories are tautological, they are still useful because they provide a framework for reasoning and understanding the world. However, they are not considered "consistent" in the sense that they do not prove both a statement and its negation.
