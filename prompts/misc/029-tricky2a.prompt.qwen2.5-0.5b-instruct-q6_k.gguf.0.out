Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Bob is right. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, not -10 degrees Celsius. The temperature difference between 0 and -10 degrees Celsius is 10 degrees Celsius, which is the freezing point of water. [end of text]
