Certainly! Let's interpret the lyrics of this song in a literal, fantastical context — not just metaphorical or symbolic, but a coherent narrative that could take place in a magical or surreal world.

### **Interpretation of the Story in a Fantastical Setting:**

The song tells the story of a **hidden, enchanted restaurant deep in the forest**, accessible only in strange or mysterious ways. It's a place that doesn't appear on normal maps or paths — even if you follow acorns ("ドングリを辿っても着きません"), you won't find it unless it *wants* to be found. It seems to appear for those who have been forgotten or overlooked by the world ("忘れた人から辿り着く").

The restaurant is **always empty**, with no reservations and plenty of open seats ("予約は一つもありません / 空席だらけのランチ時"). Yet, despite this, it's lively — small birds are fluttering and laughing ("小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる"), suggesting a whimsical or magical atmosphere.

The building itself is painted bright red ("真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根") and the menu only ever features the "special of the day" — which might imply that the food is not quite what it seems, or that it changes depending on who enters. From the kitchen, instead of clanging pots, you hear **music** — violin, flute, cello, and viola ("バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ"). This could hint that the food is prepared with magical melodies or that the restaurant is run by spirits or forest creatures who play music instead of cooking in the traditional sense.

The staff (or perhaps the restaurant itself) greets the guests with exaggerated politeness ("ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい"), inviting them to eat their fill and then fall asleep ("たらふく食べたらお眠りよ"). After that, the restaurant bids them farewell — perhaps a bit too quickly ("それでは皆さんさようなら / 明日は明日で エトセトラ").

The final verse becomes more surreal and possibly ominous. "Right to left, chaos ensues" ("右から左へおおわらわ") — this could mean that time or reality is distorted inside the restaurant. A small bear on someone's hand starts dancing ("手乗りの子熊も踊り出す"), suggesting that the guests themselves are magical beings or that the restaurant has the power to animate the inanimate.

The menu includes dishes like carpaccio, paella, appetizers, risotto, and desserts — but notably, **there are no desserts** ("デザートはありません"). This might symbolize something missing or a hidden trick in the feast. The final line — *"We'll deliver it all the way to your grave / Tonight is the final full course"* ("お墓の中まで届けましょう / 今宵は最後のフルコース") — implies that this meal is **the last one** the guest will ever eat. Perhaps the restaurant is a place where **souls are collected**, or where **final journeys begin**.

### **Putting It All Together:**

The lyrics describe a **mysterious, possibly haunted or magical restaurant** hidden deep in the forest. It's a place that appears only to those who are forgotten or lost, offering them a surreal dining experience. The restaurant is run by unseen or magical beings — spirits, forest deities, or even Death itself — who serve a feast that may be more than just food. The music from the kitchen suggests enchantment, and the cheerful birds and dancing bear add a layer of whimsy, but the final lines hint that this meal is **a last supper**, leading the guests to their final rest.

### **Possible Fantastical Interpretation:**

The restaurant is a **liminal space between life and death**, or a **portal to another world**. Those who are spiritually lost or forgotten are drawn to it. The staff are not human — perhaps spirits or forest guardians — and the meal is a **rite of passage** or a **farewell banquet** before the guest moves on to the afterlife or another realm. The cheerful atmosphere masks a deeper, darker purpose: this is not just a place to eat, but a **place where endings begin**.
