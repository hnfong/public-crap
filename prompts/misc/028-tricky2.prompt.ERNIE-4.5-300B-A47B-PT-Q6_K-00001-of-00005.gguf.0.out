Alice is correct in stating that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. This is the well-established freezing point of water.

Bob's initial statement that "water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius" is not accurate under normal conditions. However, his subsequent claim that he is still right could be justified in specific contexts. For example, if the water has impurities or if the pressure is different from standard atmospheric pressure, the freezing point can be lowered, potentially allowing water to freeze at -10 degrees Celsius. 

Without additional context suggesting these special conditions, Alice's statement is the generally accepted and correct one. [end of text]
