Imagine that the whole country of China is like one giant house.

In London, you have the Prime Minister and the King who make the rules for your house, right?

Well, China has a giant meeting called the **National People’s Congress**. Think of it as the **bigest meeting in the whole world**.

Here is how it works:

1.  **The Helpers:** Imagine thousands of people coming to a meeting. These people are like "helpers" chosen from all over China—from big cities, small farms, and snowy mountains. There are nearly 3,000 of them! That’s like filling up a huge football stadium with people.
2.  **The Job:** Their job is to meet once a year in a giant building in Beijing (the capital city). They sit there, listen to plans, and raise their hands to vote "Yes" on new rules. It’s like when your teacher asks, "Who wants to have extra playtime?" and everyone raises their hand.
3.  **The Big Boss:** While these helpers are at the meeting, there is one very important leader—the "Head Boss" (called the Premier). He stands up at the front and tells everyone, "Here is what we are going to do this year to make China happy and safe." The helpers listen and agree to the plan.

So, the National People’s Congress is just a **giant team meeting** where thousands of people get together to decide how to run their massive country for the next year. [end of text]
