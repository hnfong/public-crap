Answer the following questions with brief explanations.

A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?
B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?
A) **Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?**
   - Pure water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. However, if the water is not pure (contains impurities) or if it is under certain conditions (like being in a supercooled state), it can remain liquid below 0 degrees Celsius. At -12 degrees Celsius, pure water would typically be frozen.

B) **I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?**
   - If you cool a glass of pure water to -12 degrees Celsius, it will likely freeze. However, if the water is supercooled (cooled below its freezing point without actually freezing), it can remain liquid. Supercooled water is in a metastable state and can freeze suddenly if disturbed or if a nucleation site (like a small impurity or a scratch on the glass) is introduced. If the water does freeze, it will release heat as it transitions from a liquid to a solid state. [end of text]
