A) **Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?**
   - Pure water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. However, if the water is not pure (contains impurities) or if it is under certain conditions (like being supercooled), it can remain liquid below 0 degrees Celsius. At -12 degrees Celsius, pure water would typically be frozen.

B) **I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?**
   - If you cool a glass of pure water to -12 degrees Celsius, it will likely remain liquid initially, in a state known as supercooling. Supercooled water is below its freezing point but has not yet turned into ice. However, introducing a nucleation site (like a small impurity or disturbance) can cause the water to suddenly freeze, turning into ice. This process can happen very rapidly and is often accompanied by the formation of ice crystals. [end of text]
