🐷🐷🐷 Three little pigs lived in a small house by the forest. They each built a house with different materials: straw, wood, and brick.

🐷The first pig built a house out of straw. It was easy and quick, but not very strong. The big bad wolf came and blew it down with just a few breaths.

🐷The second pig built a house out of wood. It was stronger than the straw house, but not as strong as the brick house. The wolf tried to blow it down, but it took him a little longer.

🐷The third pig built a house out of brick. It was the strongest house of all. The wolf tried to blow it down, but he couldn't even make a dent.

The wolf went away, thinking he would come back another day when the little pigs were not home. But the little pigs were always careful and never left their house unattended.

One day, the wolf really came back. He saw the brick house and knew he couldn't blow it down. So he tried to trick the little pigs into leaving. He pretended to be a friendly dog and said, "Hey little pigs, I'm hungry! Can I come in and eat with you?"

The little pigs were careful and didn't trust him. They said, "No, we can't let you in. Our house is too strong for you to blow down."

The wolf laughed and said, "Well, then I'll just wait for you to leave! I know you'll leave eventually."

The little pigs waited and waited, but they never left. The wolf waited for days and weeks, but they never left.

Finally, the wolf got tired of waiting. He realized he couldn't get into the brick house, so he left and went away.

The little pigs were happy that they were safe. They knew their house was strong enough to protect them from the big bad wolf. And they lived happily ever after. [end of text]
