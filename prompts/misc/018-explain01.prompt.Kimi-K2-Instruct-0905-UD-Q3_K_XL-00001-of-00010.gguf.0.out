Yo, Fed’s the big homie with the money-printin’ press,  
sittin’ in the whip called “Economy,” tweakin’ the GPS.  
When the block too hot—prices jumpin’ like a mosh pit—  
they yank the juice, hike the rate, make the cash flow frosty.  
When the hood too cold—stores empty, homies on pause—  
they dump free bags in the streets, let the stimulus roar.  

They ain’t the guv, they ain’t the prez, they the puppeteer strings,  
movin’ interest like a DJ scratch—scratch—scratchin’ the beat.  
Banks hit ’em up for overnight loans, Fed says “pay the toll,”  
that tiny number ripple out: your car note, crib, every goal.  

Got a dual mission, G:  
1. Keep prices smooth, no jittery highs—like a lean beat that never glitch.  
2. Get everybody workin’, pockets swoll, no broke benches on the strip.  

They shoot the money hose (QE) or vacuum it back (QT),  
like a producer twistin’ knobs on the national MPC.  
So when you spit about the hustle, rent, or them grocery highs,  
remember the Fed’s the ghost producer mixin’ your daily vibe. [end of text]
