Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

Yo, what's good my rapper friend, let me break it down for you,
The Federal Reserve, it's the head of the money crew.
They control the flow of cash, make sure the economy stays stable,
Like a DJ on the turntable, they keep it real and able.
They set the interest rates, so banks can loan and lend,
And they make sure there's enough cash, so businesses can ascend.
They also regulate banks, to keep fraud and risk at bay,
Like a bouncer at the club, they keep the party safe and play.
So next time you're spitting rhymes, and talking money and such,
Remember the Federal Reserve, keeping the economy clutch.
Peace out.
