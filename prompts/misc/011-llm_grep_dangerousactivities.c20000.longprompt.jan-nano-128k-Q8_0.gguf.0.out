Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to perform a semantic grep on the given input, filtering lines that obviously relate to dangerous activities that may get somebody hurt. The key is to identify lines that clearly mention dangerous activities, not just tangentially related ones.

First, I need to understand the query: "dangerous activities that may get somebody hurt." So, I'm looking for lines that explicitly talk about activities that are inherently risky or could cause harm. I should look for keywords like "dangerous," "harm," "hurt," "hazardous," "risk," "hazard," "injury," "harmful," etc. But I also need to be careful not to include lines that are just about something dangerous in a non-activity context, like a dangerous animal or a dangerous place, unless they're about activities.

Looking through the input, each line is a bookmark or link with some description. Let's go line by line.

Line 1: "Other bookmarks" – no mention of activities, just a category. Not relevant.

Line 2: Empty. Ignore.

Line 326: "The Horror Story of the Shaken Baby Syndrome" – this is a dangerous activity (shaken baby syndrome is a result of shaking a baby, which is dangerous). So line 326: "The Horror Story of the Shaken Baby Syndrome" – this is a direct match.
