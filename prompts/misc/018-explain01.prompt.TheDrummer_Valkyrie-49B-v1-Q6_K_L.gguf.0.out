Yo, listen up, let me break it down,
'Bout the Fed, the central bank in the town.
They ain't no record label, but they make the dough,
Controlling the money flow, yo, that's what they know.

They set the interest rates, the cost to borrow,
Affects the economy, don't you know?
Low rates, people spend, the economy grows,
High rates, they save, the economy slows.

They regulate the banks, make sure they're tight,
So your money's safe, day and night.
They print the cash, but not too much,
Keep inflation in check, that's a must.

They're like the DJ, spinning the tracks,
Keeping the economy on the right tracks.
Recession hits, they stimulate,
Pouring in cash, participate.

So that's the Fed in a nutshell, my G,
Controlling the money, economy, and the key.
They ain't perfect, but they do their part,
Keeping the economy from a major heart attack, yo, that's a fact! [end of text]
