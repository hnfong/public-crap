In this scenario, Alice needs to find a way to deal with Bob's Orim, Samite Healer, which can prevent up to 3 damage per tap. Alice has two copies of Kindle in her hand, and each Kindle deals damage equal to 2 plus the number of Kindles in all graveyards. Let's break down the optimal plays for both players step by step.

### Alice's Optimal Play

1. **First Kindle:**
   - Alice casts the first Kindle targeting Orim.
   - The damage dealt by the first Kindle is \(2 + 0 = 2\) (since there are no Kindles in the graveyards yet).
   - Bob can respond by tapping Orim to prevent the next 3 damage. Since the damage is only 2, Orim will prevent all 2 damage, and Orim will remain alive.

2. **Second Kindle:**
   - Alice casts the second Kindle targeting Orim.
   - The damage dealt by the second Kindle is \(2 + 1 = 3\) (since there is now 1 Kindle in the graveyard).
   - Bob can again respond by tapping Orim to prevent the next 3 damage. However, this time, the damage is exactly 3, and Orim will prevent all 3 damage, but it will be tapped and still alive.

### Bob's Optimal Play

- Bob's optimal play is to tap Orim to prevent the damage from both Kindles. Since Orim can prevent up to 3 damage per tap, it can handle both Kindles if Alice plays them one at a time.

### Outcome

- After Alice casts both Kindles, Orim will have prevented all the damage and will remain alive, but it will be tapped. Alice will not be able to kill Orim with the two Kindles she has.

### Thought Process

- **Alice's Thought Process:**
  - Alice knows that each Kindle deals 2 damage initially, and the second Kindle will deal 3 damage due to the first Kindle being in the graveyard.
  - Alice also knows that Orim can prevent up to 3 damage per tap, which means Orim can survive both Kindles if Bob uses its ability optimally.
  - Alice might consider other plays if she has other cards in her deck or hand, but with only two Kindles, she cannot kill Orim.

- **Bob's Thought Process:**
  - Bob recognizes that Orim can prevent up to 3 damage per tap, which is sufficient to handle the damage from both Kindles.
  - Bob will tap Orim to prevent the damage from each Kindle, ensuring Orim survives and remains a threat to Alice's burn deck.

### Conclusion

The optimal play for Alice is to cast both Kindles targeting Orim, but the optimal play for Bob is to tap Orim to prevent the damage from both Kindles. As a result, Orim will survive, but it will be tapped. Alice will not be able to kill Orim with the two Kindles she has, and Bob will maintain a defensive presence on the board. [end of text]
