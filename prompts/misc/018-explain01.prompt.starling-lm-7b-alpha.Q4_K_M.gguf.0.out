Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

Alright, listen up! The Federal Reserve, it's like the bank of banks, man. It's in charge of making sure the money supply stays stable, so we don't have no crazy inflation or deflation going on. They set the interest rates, which affects how much it costs to borrow money.

Now, imagine the Federal Reserve as the DJ at a party. They control the music, the money supply, and they make sure everyone's having a good time. They also keep an eye on the economy, like a bouncer at a club, making sure everything runs smoothly.

So, the Federal Reserve, it's like the backbone of the financial system, man. It's there to keep everything in check, and make sure we got that green paper, that's good as gold, y'know?
