In this scenario, Alice and Bob are in a specific Magic the Gathering situation where Alice has two copies of 'Kindle' in her hand and Bob has 'Orim, Samite Healer' in play. Let's break down the optimal plays for both players.

### Alice's Optimal Play

Alice's goal is to kill Orim, Samite Healer. Since Orim has the ability to prevent the next 3 damage dealt to any target this turn, Alice needs to deal more than 3 damage to Orim in a single turn to ensure its destruction.

Here's the step-by-step thought process for Alice:

1. **Calculate Damage from Kindle:**
   - Each 'Kindle' deals X damage, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards.
   - Since there are no Kindles in the graveyard yet, each Kindle will deal 2 damage initially.
   - If Alice casts both Kindles, the first Kindle will deal 2 damage, and the second Kindle will deal 4 damage (since the first Kindle will be in the graveyard by then).

2. **Total Damage Calculation:**
   - First Kindle: 2 damage
   - Second Kindle: 4 damage (after the first Kindle is in the graveyard)
   - Total damage: 2 + 4 = 6 damage

3. **Orim's Damage Prevention:**
   - Orim can prevent the next 3 damage dealt to any target this turn.
   - Therefore, Orim will prevent the first 3 damage from the first Kindle.

4. **Net Damage to Orim:**
   - After Orim prevents 3 damage, the remaining damage from the first Kindle is 2 - 3 = 0 (Orim prevents all 2 damage).
   - The second Kindle will then deal 4 damage, which Orim cannot prevent since its ability only prevents the next 3 damage.
   - Net damage to Orim: 0 (from the first Kindle) + 4 (from the second Kindle) = 4 damage.

5. **Orim's Health:**
   - Orim has 3 toughness.
   - After taking 4 damage, Orim will be destroyed.

### Bob's Optimal Play

Bob's goal is to prevent Orim from being destroyed. Given that Alice has two Kindles and Bob has no cards in hand, Bob's options are limited. However, he can try to maximize the damage prevention from Orim.

Here's the step-by-step thought process for Bob:

1. **Use Orim's Ability:**
   - Bob should tap Orim to activate its ability, preventing the next 3 damage dealt to any target this turn.
   - This will prevent the first 3 damage from Alice's first Kindle.

2. **Evaluate Remaining Damage:**
   - After Orim prevents 3 damage, the first Kindle will deal 0 damage to Orim.
   - The second Kindle will then deal 4 damage, which Orim cannot prevent.
   - Orim will take 4 damage in total and be destroyed.

### Conclusion

Given the mechanics and the available options, Alice's optimal play is to cast both Kindles in sequence. The first Kindle will deal 2 damage, which Orim will prevent, and the second Kindle will deal 4 damage, which Orim cannot prevent, resulting in Orim's destruction. Bob's optimal play is to use Orim's ability to prevent the first 3 damage, but this will not be enough to save Orim from the 4 damage dealt by the second Kindle.

**Outcome:** Alice will kill Orim, Samite Healer, by dealing a total of 6 damage, with Orim preventing the first 3 damage. [end of text]
