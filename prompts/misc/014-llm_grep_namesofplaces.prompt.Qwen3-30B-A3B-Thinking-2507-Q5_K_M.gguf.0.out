<think>
We are to output only the country or region names (with line number) from the input lines that obviously match the query.
 The query is: "names of countries or regions"

 We note that the input is numbered from 1 to 19.

 We must ignore lines that do not contain a country or region name.

 Let's go through each line:

 1: "Let's Talk about Unfair Trade Restrictions" -> no country/region name -> skip.
 2: "In today's world, it's hard to understand why countries impose extra restrictions on importing goods from nations they consider "unbalanced" in trade." -> "countries" and "nations" are generic, not specific names -> skip.
 3: (empty) -> skip.
 4: "Take Britain, for example. They allow Silesia lawns to be imported for personal consumption, but prohibit French cambrics and lawns, even if they're meant for export. The UK also imposes higher duties on French wine, while being lenient towards Portugal." 
    - Countries/regions: Britain, Silesia, French (but note: "French" is an adjective, not a country name; however, the context refers to France), UK (which is a country, but note: UK is an abbreviation for United Kingdom), Portugal.
    - However, note the instruction: "only output the country/region names". We should output the actual names as they appear in the text? But note: the query says "names", so we should output the specific names.

    But note: the instruction says "only output the country/region names", meaning we are to extract the names. However, the example says "something like grep -n -o", meaning we output the matching substring.

    However, the problem says: "output the line or requested contents of the line (together with line number)" but then says "only output the country/region names". So we are to output the country/region name (the substring) and the line number.

    But note: the example output format: "line number: country name"

    However, the instruction says: "only output the country/region names with line number, something like grep -n -o"

    So for line 4, we have:
        Britain -> country (United Kingdom, but here called Britain)
        Silesia -> region (historical region, now part of Poland, but it's a region name)
        French -> this is an adjective, not a country name. We should not output "French" because it's not the name of a country. The country is France, but the word "French" is used as an adjective. Similarly, "UK" is an abbreviation for the United Kingdom, which is a country. But note: the text says "UK", which is a common abbreviation for the country.

    However, the instruction says: "only output the country/region names". So we should output:
        Britain (as a country name, though note: Britain is often used for the UK)
        Silesia (as a region)
        UK (as an abbreviation for the country)
        Portugal (country)

    But note: the text says "French" and "Portugal". We are to output the exact words that are country/region names? However, "French" is not a country name. The country is France, but the word "French" is not the country name. Similarly, "UK" is an abbreviation for the country, so it's acceptable.

    Let's check the common practice: 
        - "Britain" is a common name for the UK (though technically it refers to the island, but in context it's used for the country).
        - "Silesia" is a region (so we output it).
        - "UK" is an abbreviation for the United Kingdom (a country) -> we output "UK".
        - "Portugal" is a country.

    However, note that the text says "French cambrics" - the word "French" is an adjective. We are not to output adjectives. So we skip "French".

    So for line 4, we have:
        Britain
        Silesia
        UK
        Portugal

    But note: the instruction says "only output the country/region names", meaning we output each occurrence? However, the example says "grep -n -o", which would output each matching word.

    However, the problem says: "output the line or requested contents of the line" meaning we are to output the matching substring (the country name) and the line number.

    So for line 4, we would output:
        4: Britain
        4: Silesia
        4: UK
        4: Portugal

    But note: the instruction says "together with line number", so we output the line number and then the name.

    However, the problem also says: "Only trigger when the input obviously matches the query, i.e. not tangentially related." So we are to be strict.

    Let's check the other lines.

 5: (empty) -> skip.
 6: "Some argue that if Britain imports French goods, the balance of trade will shift in favor of France." 
    - Britain (already seen, but we output again because it's in this line) -> but note: we are to output for every line that has a match, so we output for this line too.
    - France (country) -> note: the word "France" appears as the country name (not "French", which is the adjective). So we output "France".
    - However, note: the text says "France", so that's a country name.

    So for line 6: 
        Britain
        France

 7: (empty) -> skip.
 8: "Another issue is that there's no reliable way to determine which country has the "balance of trade" in their favor. National biases and prejudices often influence decisions, rather than objective facts. Custom-house books and the course of exchange are supposed to be indicators, but they're often inaccurate."
    - "country" (generic) -> skip.
    - No specific country names -> skip.

 9: (empty) -> skip.
10: "When the exchange rate between two countries is at par, it's said to indicate a balance. But when a premium is paid for a bill, it means one country has to send money to the other. This doesn't necessarily mean one country is exporting more than it imports."
    - "countries" (generic) -> skip.

11: (empty) -> skip.
12: (empty) -> skip.
13: (empty) -> skip.
14: (empty) -> skip.
15: "[Show original]" -> skip.

16: "The value of trade between two countries isn't always easy to determine. Just because one country usually pays its debts to another doesn't mean that the trade balance is in its favor. Imagine if England's merchants often pay for goods from Hamburg, Dantzic, and Riga using bills from Holland. This would affect the debt and credit balance between England and Holland, even if England's exports to Holland exceed its imports."
    - Countries/regions: England, Hamburg, Dantzic, Riga, Holland.
        - England: country (or region, but it's a country name)
        - Hamburg: city (but note: it's a city in Germany, but the text uses it as a place name. However, the query says "countries or regions". Hamburg is a city, but it's often used to refer to the region? However, the instruction says "countries or regions", so we might consider it as a region? But note: the query is for country/region names. Hamburg is a city, not a country or a region (like a state or province). However, in historical context, Hamburg was a free city and a region. But the problem says "obviously matches", so we have to be cautious.

    Let's see: 
        - England: country (we'll take it as a country name)
        - Hamburg: it's a city, but the text uses it as a place. However, the query says "countries or regions", and Hamburg is a city, not a country. But note: sometimes in historical trade, cities like Hamburg are referred to as regions. However, the problem says "obviously matches", so we should only output if it's clearly a country or region.

    We'll consider:
        - England: yes (country)
        - Hamburg: it's a city, but the text uses it as a place in trade. However, the query says "countries or regions", and Hamburg is not a country. But note: the text also says "Holland", which is a region (historically, the Netherlands was called Holland, but now it's the Netherlands). So we'll output:
            England, Hamburg, Dantzic, Riga, Holland.

    However, note:
        - Dantzic: this is an old name for GdaÅ„sk (in Poland). It's a city, but again, we are to output if it's a country or region. Dantzic is a city, but the text uses it as a place. Similarly, Riga is a city (capital of Latvia). 

    But the problem says: "only output the country/region names". We are to be strict. The instruction says "obviously matches", so we should only output if it's a country or a region (like a country name or a well-known region). 

    Let's check common practice in such tasks: 
        - In historical texts, cities like Hamburg, Dantzic, Riga, and Holland (which is a region) are often used as place names. However, note that "Holland" is a region (of the Netherlands) and is commonly used to refer to the Netherlands. So we'll output "Holland" as a region.

        But for Hamburg, Dantzic, Riga: they are cities. The problem does not specify that we should output only country names, but "countries or regions". A city is not a country or a region (unless it's a region like "Holland", which is a region). So we might skip the cities.

    However, note that the text says "Hamburg, Dantzic, and Riga" as places from which goods are imported. The query is for country/region names. The text does not say "the country of Hamburg", so it's ambiguous.

    But the instruction says: "only trigger when the input obviously matches". So if it's a city, it's not obviously a country or region. Therefore, we should skip the cities.

    However, let's look at the context: 
        - "goods from Hamburg, Dantzic, and Riga" -> these are cities, so they are not country names. But note: sometimes in old texts, they refer to the city as the region (like "Hamburg" meaning the Hamburg region). But the problem says "obviously", so we'll be cautious.

    We'll output:
        England (country)
        Holland (region, as it's a common historical reference for the Netherlands)

    But note: the text says "Holland", which is a region (and often used for the country). So we output "Holland".

    So for line 16:
        England
        Holland

    However, note: the text says "England" and "Holland", so we output those.

17: "The way we calculate exchange rates can also be misleading. It's like saying that a country's currency is worth a certain amount based on its mint's standard, but this standard might not reflect the actual value of the currency. For example, before a coin reform in England, the value of the English currency was actually lower than its standard value. This means that the real exchange rate might be different from the calculated one."
    - England (country) -> output "England"

18: (empty) -> skip.
19: "Another issue is that the cost of coinage is different in each country. In England, the government covers the cost, but in France, individuals pay a duty of 8% for coinage. This makes French coins more valuable than English coins with the same amount of silver. So, even if the coins are near their standard values, a sum of English money couldn't buy an equal amount of French money."
    - England (country) -> output "England"
    - France (country) -> output "France"

 Now, let's compile the list:

 Line 4: 
    Britain -> output "4: Britain"
    Silesia -> output "4: Silesia"
    UK -> output "4: UK"
    Portugal -> output "4: Portugal"

 Line 6:
    Britain -> output "6: Britain"
    France -> output "6: France"

 Line 16:
    England -> output "16: England"
    Holland -> output "16: Holland"

 Line 17:
    England -> output "17: England"

 Line 19:
    England -> output "19: England"
    France -> output "19: France"

 But note: the instruction says "only output the country/region names", meaning we output the exact string that is the country/region name as it appears.

 However, note that in line 4, we have "UK" and "Portugal", and in line 6 we have "France", etc.

 Now, we must output each one on a separate line, with the line number and the name, and then a "---" after each.

 Important: the problem says "after each line of output, also emit a '---' to separate it from your next output."

 So for each match, we output:
   <line_number>: <name>
   ---

 But note: the problem says "output the line or requested contents of the line (together with line number)" meaning we output the line number and the name (the matching substring). We are not outputting the entire line.

 However, note: the example says "something like grep -n -o", which outputs the line number and the matching word.

 So we output:

4: Britain
---
4: Silesia
---
4: UK
---
4: Portugal
---
6: Britain
---
6: France
---
16: England
---
16: Holland
---
17: England
---
19: England
---
19: France
---

 But note: the problem says "only output the country/region names with line number", so we are outputting exactly that.

 However, let's double-check the line numbers and the names:

 Line 4: 
   "Britain" -> yes
   "Silesia" -> yes (it's a region, and it's a proper noun)
   "UK" -> yes (abbreviation for United Kingdom, a country)
   "Portugal" -> yes

 Line 6:
   "Britain" -> yes
   "France" -> yes (the country name)

 Line 16:
   "England" -> yes (country)
   "Holland" -> yes (region, and it's a common historical reference for the Netherlands)

 Line 17:
   "England" -> yes

 Line 19:
   "England" -> yes
   "France" -> yes

 Now, note: in line 4, we have "UK", which is an abbreviation. We are to output it as it appears.

 Also note: in line 4, we have "Silesia" - it's a historical region, but it's a proper noun and the text uses it as a place. So we output it.

 However, let's check if there are any other lines:

 Line 19: "In England, ... in France" -> so "England" and "France" are the country names.

 But note: in line 19, the text says "English" and "French" as adjectives? 
   - "English currency" -> adjective, so we don't output "English"
   - "French coins" -> adjective, so we don't output "French"
   - But the text also says "England" (the country) and "France" (the country) in the same line? Actually, the text says:
        "In England, the government covers the cost, but in France, individuals pay a duty"
        So "England" and "France" are used as country names.

 Therefore, we output "England" and "France" for line 19.

 Now, we output each one as described.

 Important: the problem says "If no lines match just give empty response." But we have matches.

 Let's write the output accordingly.

 Note: We must not output anything else.

 Format for each match:
   <line_number>: <name>
   ---

 We'll output exactly that.

 However, note: the problem says "only output the country/region names", meaning we are not to output the entire line, just the name.

 So we output:

4: Britain
---
4: Silesia
---
4: UK
---
4: Portugal
---
6: Britain
---
6: France
---
16: England
---
16: Holland
---
17: England
---
19: England
---
19: France
---

 But note: the problem says "together with line number", so we are including the line number.

 However, note that the line numbers in the input are given (like "1:", "2:", etc.), but we are to output the line number as it appears in the input (so 4, 6, etc.).

 We are using the line number as given (the number before the colon in the input).

 Now, let's write the output.

6: France
