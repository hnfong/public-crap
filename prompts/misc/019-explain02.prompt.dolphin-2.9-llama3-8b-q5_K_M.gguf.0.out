The National People's Congress (NPC) is like a big meeting place in China where important people come together to make decisions about the country. Just like how your parents help make decisions about your life, the people at the NPC help make decisions for China. They make rules and laws to keep everyone safe and make sure everything runs smoothly. It's a bit like a big group of teachers and principals who make sure everyone at school follows the rules.<|im_end|>
