<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to output lines that contain comments. Comments in bash script start with '#'. So lines with '#' at start or after whitespace? The script lines with comments: line 4, 15, 20, 29, 38, 48, 56. Also line 1? line 1 starts with #! which is a shebang, not a comment but still starts with '#'. The query: "all lines with comments". Shebang is not a comment but it's a special line starting with '#!'. Should we include? The instruction: "lines with comments". Shebang is not a comment but it's a line starting with '#!'. Usually considered a comment? It's a special case. The query likely expects lines that have comments, including shebang? The example: "lines with comments" might include shebang? The instruction: "Only trigger when the input obviously matches the query, i.e. not tangentially related." Shebang is not a comment but it's a line starting with '#!'. Might be considered a comment? I'd include it because it's a comment-like line. But maybe they want only lines that have comment text after '#', not shebang. The query: "all lines with comments". I'd include lines that have '#' anywhere. That includes shebang. So lines: 1,4,15,20,29,38,48,56. Also line 65? No comment. So output those lines with line numbers and "---" after each.

Let's produce output:

1:#!/bin/bash
---
4:# Save the path to ./download_check script
---
15:# This is a script to build and install tmux on macOS without homebrew.
---
20:# Download and build pkg-config
---
29:# Download and build ncurses
---
38:# Download and build libevent
---
48:# Download and build utf8proc
---
56:# Download and build tmux

Check if any other lines contain '#'? None. So output those.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>1:#!/bin/bash
