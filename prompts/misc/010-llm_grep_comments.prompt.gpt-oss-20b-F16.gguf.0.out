<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to output lines that contain comments. In bash script, comments start with '#'. Lines with '#' at start or after whitespace? The query: "all lines with comments". So lines that contain comments. In this script, lines 4, 15, 20, 29, 38, 48, 56, 65? Wait 65 is not comment. Let's list lines with '#'.

Line 4: "# Save the path to ./download_check script"
Line 15: "# This is a script to build and install tmux on macOS without homebrew."
Line 20: "# Download and build pkg-config"
Line 29: "# Download and build ncurses"
Line 38: "# Download and build libevent"
Line 48: "# Download and build utf8proc"
Line 56: "# Download and build tmux"
Line 65: "ln -sf "$prefix"/bin/tmux ~/bin/tmux" no comment.

Also line 1: "#!/bin/bash" is a shebang, not a comment? It's a comment line but it's a shebang. Should we include? It's a comment line but maybe considered comment. The query: "all lines with comments". Shebang is a comment line. So include line 1.

Also line 2: "set -ex" no comment.

Line 3: blank.

Line 4: comment.

Line 5: no comment.

Line 6: no comment.

Line 7: blank.

Line 8: function definition.

So lines with comments: 1,4,15,20,29,38,48,56. Also maybe line 65? No.

Also line 1 is shebang. Should we include? The query: "all lines with comments". Shebang is a comment line. So include.

Thus output lines with line numbers and content, each followed by "---".

We need to output exactly as "semantic_grep" would: line number: content. The input lines have "1:#!/bin/bash". So we output that line exactly. Then "---". Then "4:# Save the path to ./download_check script". Then "---". etc.

Let's produce.
