Let's break down the optimal play for both Alice and Bob in this situation.

### Alice's Perspective

Alice has two copies of Kindle in her hand. Her goal is to kill Orim, Samite Healer, which is a 1/3 creature with a tap ability that can prevent 3 damage to any target this turn.

**Thought Process:**
1. **Direct Damage Approach:** Alice can cast one Kindle to deal 4 damage (2 + 1 Kindle in hand) to Orim. However, Bob can tap Orim to prevent the damage.
2. **Two-Step Approach:** Alice can cast one Kindle to deal 4 damage to Orim, but Bob will tap Orim to prevent the damage. Then, Alice can cast the second Kindle to deal 6 damage (2 + 2 Kindles in hand) to Orim, which will kill Orim since Orim can only prevent 3 damage.

**Optimal Play for Alice:**
- Cast one Kindle to deal 4 damage to Orim.
- Bob will tap Orim to prevent the damage.
- Cast the second Kindle to deal 6 damage to Orim, which will kill Orim.

### Bob's Perspective

Bob's goal is to prevent Alice from killing Orim. He has Orim, Samite Healer, which can prevent 3 damage to any target this turn.

**Thought Process:**
1. **Immediate Prevention:** Bob can tap Orim to prevent the damage from the first Kindle.
2. **Second Kindle:** Bob needs to consider that Alice will likely cast the second Kindle after the first one. Bob needs to decide whether to use Orim's prevention ability on the first Kindle or save it for the second Kindle.

**Optimal Play for Bob:**
- Tap Orim to prevent the 4 damage from the first Kindle.
- Save Orim's prevention ability for the second Kindle, but since Orim can only prevent 3 damage, it will not be enough to save Orim from the 6 damage from the second Kindle.

### Outcome

1. Alice casts the first Kindle, dealing 4 damage to Orim.
2. Bob taps Orim to prevent the 4 damage.
3. Alice casts the second Kindle, dealing 6 damage to Orim.
4. Orim can only prevent 3 damage, so Orim takes 3 damage and dies.

**Final Outcome:**
- Alice successfully kills Orim with her two Kindles.
- Bob's prevention ability was not enough to save Orim from the combined damage of the two Kindles.

### Summary

- **Alice's Optimal Play:** Cast one Kindle, then cast the second Kindle to deal a total of 6 damage to Orim, killing it.
- **Bob's Optimal Play:** Tap Orim to prevent the damage from the first Kindle, but this is not enough to save Orim from the second Kindle.

Alice's strategy of using both Kindles in sequence is the optimal play, and Bob's prevention ability is not sufficient to counter it. [end of text]
