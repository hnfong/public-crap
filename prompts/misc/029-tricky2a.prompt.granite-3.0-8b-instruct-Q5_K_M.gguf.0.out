Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is not entirely correct. While it's true that water can freeze at temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius, it's not accurate to say that it freezes at -10 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius, and it will start to freeze at this temperature. However, the freezing process can be influenced by factors such as pressure and impurities, which can cause it to freeze at slightly lower temperatures. But in standard conditions, water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, not -10 degrees Celsius.
