Bob is right in this scenario. The statement "It freezes" is a general observation that can be true in different contexts. In this specific context, Alice is correct that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, not at -10 degrees Celsius. 

Bob's response acknowledges that his initial statement was a general observation rather than a precise scientific fact. This is a good practice in scientific communication, as it avoids confusion and emphasizes the importance of precision in scientific contexts. [end of text]
