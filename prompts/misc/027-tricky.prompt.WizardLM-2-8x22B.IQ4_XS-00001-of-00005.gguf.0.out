 A) No, pure water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. The freezing point of water is the temperature at which liquid water becomes solid ice. However, the presence of impurities or changes in pressure can alter the freezing point, a phenomenon known as freezing point depression.

B) If you have a glass of pure water and you cool it down to -12 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure, the water will not freeze. Instead, it will become supercooled water. Supercooling is a process where a liquid is cooled below its freezing point without becoming a solid. This can happen if the water is very pure and free of nucleation sites, which are tiny particles or imperfections that ice crystals can form around. If you disturb the supercooled water, for example by shaking it or adding a small piece of ice, it can suddenly freeze as the water molecules rapidly form an ice crystal structure.

If the water is not pure and contains impurities like salt or other dissolved substances, the freezing point would be lower than 0 degrees Celsius due to the colligative property of freezing point depression. The exact temperature at which such a solution would freeze depends on the concentration of the solute. However, at -12 degrees Celsius, even impure water would likely be in a liquid state unless the concentration of impurities is very high or the pressure is significantly altered. [end of text]
