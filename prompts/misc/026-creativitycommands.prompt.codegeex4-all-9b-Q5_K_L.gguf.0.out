I have written a fan fiction based on World of Warcraft characters. I saved the file into wowfanfic.txt

What is a probable output if I run this Linux command?

$ cat wowfanfic.txt | perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }' | sort |  uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 20

Explain your answer with respect to basic linguistic principles.

The command you provided is a series of Linux commands chained together using the pipe operator (`|`). Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

1. `cat wowfanfic.txt`: This command reads the contents of the file `wowfanfic.txt` and outputs it to the standard output (your screen).

2. `perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'`: This command processes the output of the previous command with Perl. The `-ne` option tells Perl to read the input line by line. The `split(/\s/)` function splits each line into words based on whitespace. The `foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }` loop then prints each word on a new line.

3. `sort`: This command sorts the output of the previous command, which is now a list of words.

4. `uniq -c`: This command removes duplicate lines from the sorted list and counts the occurrences of each unique line.

5. `sort -n`: This command sorts the output of the previous command numerically, which is now a list of word counts.

6. `tail -n 20`: This command outputs the last 20 lines of the sorted list, which are the 20 most common words and their counts.

Given the nature of fan fiction, the output of this command is likely to be a list of the 20 most common words used in the fan fiction, along with their counts. This can be useful for analyzing the vocabulary used in the fan fiction and identifying common themes or topics.

Here's an example of what the output might look like:

```
   1 a
   1 b
   1 c
   1 d
   1 e
   1 f
   1 g
   1 h
   1 i
   1 j
   1 k
   1 l
   1 m
   1 n
   1 o
   1 p
   1 q
   1 r
   1 s
   1 t
```

In this example, each word appears only once, which means that the fan fiction uses each word only once. This is a very unusual case and suggests that the fan fiction is very short or that the author has a very unique writing style.
