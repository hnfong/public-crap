Bob is technically correct, but his statement is misleading without context.

Water's standard freezing point is indeed **0°C** (as Alice stated). However, once water has frozen into ice, it remains frozen at **-10°C**. Therefore, at -10 degrees Celsius, water exists as ice.

Bob is "right" only in the sense that water is in a frozen state at that temperature, but he is wrong to imply that -10°C is the specific temperature at which the liquid-to-solid transition occurs. [end of text]
