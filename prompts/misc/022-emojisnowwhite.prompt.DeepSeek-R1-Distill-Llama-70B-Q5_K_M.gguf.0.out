Okay, so I need to write a story about Snow White using only emojis. The user mentioned that the protagonist should resemble the classical Snow White but I can be creative. Hmm, let me think about the key elements of the Snow White story. There's Snow White herself, the Evil Queen, the magic mirror, the poisoned apple, the Seven Dwarfs, the forest, the handsome prince, and the happy ending.

I should start by representing Snow White. Maybe a princess emoji 👸. Then the Evil Queen, perhaps a queen emoji 👑 with a dark tone or something. The magic mirror could be a mirror emoji 🪞. The poisoned apple is a red apple 🍎 but maybe with a poison symbol ☠️. The Seven Dwarfs could be represented by seven small people or maybe a dwarf emoji if there is one, but I think there isn't, so maybe seven 👨🏻. The forest is 🌲, the handsome prince is a prince 👑, and the happy ending could be a wedding 🎉 or a heart ❤️.

Let me try to put this together in a sequence. Start with Snow White 👸, then the Evil Queen 👑, the mirror 🪞, the poisoned apple 🍎☠️, the forest 🌲, the dwarfs 👨🏻 repeated seven times, then the prince 👑, and finally the happy ending with a wedding 🎉 and love heart ❤️.

Wait, maybe I can add more details. The Evil Queen being jealous, so maybe a green face emoji 🟢 or an angry face 😠. The magic mirror showing something, so maybe a sparkle ✨. The poisoned apple being offered, so maybe a hand giving it 🤚. The forest could have animals 🦌. The dwarfs could be working with tools like pickaxes ⛏️. The prince finding her asleep, so maybe a sleeping emoji 😴, then a castle 🏰, and the wedding.

Let me try to structure this step by step. Maybe start with the queen looking in the mirror, seeing Snow White, getting jealous, ordering the apple, Snow White running into the forest, meeting dwarfs, the prince arrives, they fall in love, and get married.

So the sequence could be: 👑🪞👸😠🍎☠️👸🏃♀️🌲🦌👨🏻⛏️🏠👸😴👑💎💍🎉❤️

Wait, maybe add more elements like the queen disguised as an old woman 👵, offering the apple 🍎, and the awakening with a kiss 💋. So perhaps: 👑🪞👸😠👵🍎☠️👸🏃♀️🌲🦌👨🏻⛏️🏠👸😴👑💋💎💍🎉❤️

I think that covers the main points. Let me check if I have all the elements: queen, mirror, Snow White, jealousy, poisoned apple, escape to forest, dwarfs, prince, awakening, marriage. Yes, that seems to cover it. I'll go with that.
