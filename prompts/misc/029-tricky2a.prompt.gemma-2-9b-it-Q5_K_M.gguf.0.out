Bob is technically right, but Alice is closer to the commonly understood answer. Here's why:

* **Freezing Point:** The precise freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) at standard atmospheric pressure. 

* **Supercooling:**  Water can sometimes remain liquid below its freezing point in a state called supercooling. This is unstable, and any disturbance can cause it to freeze rapidly.

Bob is likely referring to the fact that water *can* freeze at temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius if it's supercooled. However, this is an unusual circumstance, and most people associate 0 degrees Celsius as the freezing point of water.
