We are given a query: "lines that contain dialog or spoken text"
 We must output the line number and the line only if the line contains dialog or spoken text.
 We ignore lines that are not obviously dialog or spoken text.

 Steps:
 1. We'll go through each line of the input (with line numbers).
 2. We need to identify lines that are clearly dialog (i.e., contain speech, often in quotes or with dialogue markers).
 3. We note that the input is in Chinese, so we look for Chinese quotation marks (「」) or other indicators of speech.

 Important: Only trigger when the input obviously matches (not tangentially related).

 Let's examine the input:

 Line 1: "# 呆總嘅老豆" -> This is a title, not dialog.
 Line 2: empty -> skip.
 Line 3: empty -> skip.
 Line 4: "「轟隆！」" -> This is an onomatopoeic expression (like thunder) in quotes. It's not a spoken dialog by a character, but it's in quotes. However, note that the query says "dialog or spoken text". This is not spoken by a character, but an action sound. We must be cautious.

 But note: the query says "dialog or spoken text". Typically, dialog refers to what characters say. The thunder sound is not spoken by a character, so we might skip it.

 However, let's check the context. The problem says: "Only trigger when the input obviously matches the query, i.e. not tangentially related."

 We have to be strict. The example in the input:

 Line 8: "「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」"

 This line has two parts in quotes: "「啊～！」" and "「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」". The first part is an exclamation (like "Ah!") and the second is a spoken line. So this line contains spoken text.

 Similarly, we look for lines that have text in quotation marks (「」) that are clearly spoken by a character.

 Let's go through each line:

 Line 4: "「轟隆！」" -> This is an onomatopoeic sound (thunder) and is not a character speaking. So we skip.

 Line 6: "平靜嘅夜空，竟然響起乾雷。" -> This is narrative, not dialog.

 Line 8: Contains two quoted parts: "「啊～！」" and "「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」" -> This is spoken text. So we output this line.

 Line 10: "我望住屋外天色，月光一早被黑雲淹沒，濕氣極重。欽天監今次仲唔掛黑色暴雨警告的話，聽朝睇怕會有十萬人上書皇上，叫佢炒咗嗰班粉腸。" -> Narrative, not dialog.

 Line 12: "「轟隆！」 呢次雷聲，果然帶來傾盤大雨，屋外屋頂雨聲不絕。" -> The first part "「轟隆！」" is the thunder sound, but the rest is narrative. However, the line starts with a quoted thunder sound. But note: the query is for "dialog or spoken text". The thunder sound is not spoken by a character. So we skip? But wait, the line has the thunder sound in quotes and then narrative. The narrative part is not dialog. So we skip.

 However, note: the problem says "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". The line does contain a quoted part, but that quoted part is not dialog (it's an onomatopoeia). So we skip.

 But let's compare with line 8: in line 8, the quoted parts are clearly spoken by the character (the "老夫" says "啊～!" and then "⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇."). So we output line 8.

 Line 14: "我喺呢間屋已經孤獨度過十八個寒暑，屋頂落雨嘅滴嗒聲每一個細節，一早了然於胸。" -> Narrative.

 Line 19: "屋頂 ⋯⋯ 多咗一個人。" -> Narrative.

 Line 21: "我手握劍柄，六神歸一，留心傾聽。果然有人喺屋頂跳落後庭院！輕盈嘅腳步聲極之細微，來者顯然學過輕功。如果唔係忽然落大雨，敵人嘅突襲可能已經得手。" -> Narrative.

 Line 22: empty -> skip.

 Line 23: "腳步聲越嚟越近，我腰間寶劍出鞘嘅一刻，廳門已經「嘭！」一聲被踢爆。" -> The "「嘭！」" is an onomatopoeic sound (the door being kicked), not spoken dialog. So skip.

 Line 24: "好在老夫力拔山河氣蓋世，雖然咁樣斬法我把寶劍肯定見財化水，但刀劍相交嘅時候，我感覺到對方力氣似乎比我大大不如。" -> Narrative.

 Line 25: empty -> skip.

 Line 26: "「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」" -> This is clearly a spoken line (in quotes). So we output this line.

 Line 27: empty -> skip.

 Line 28: "「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。難怪我同佢對打可以力拔山河。平時我邊有咁大力？佢口裡強硬，卻一個翻身跳出牆外，似乎想逃走。" -> The first part is in quotes: "「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」", which is spoken text. So we output this line.

 Line 29: empty -> skip.

 Line 30: empty -> skip.

 Line 31: empty -> skip.

 Line 32: empty -> skip.

 Line 33: "我提劍急追，佢見我迫近，回身一劍，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕。" -> The "「屌」一聲" is an exclamation (like "Damn!"), which is a spoken sound. So this line contains spoken text. We output this line.

 Line 34: empty -> skip.

 Line 35: "此時大雨已經停止，烏雲漸散。月光之下見到黑衣人喺泥地上不斷掙扎，卻已經無力起身再戰。黑衣人嘅臉相有點似曾相識，我再望返佢把劍，大吃一驚。咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天劍？！" -> Narrative, but note: "咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天劍？！" is an exclamation by the narrator. However, the problem says "dialog or spoken text". This is the narrator speaking (internal monologue or direct speech). But note: the query doesn't specify only character dialog, so we consider any spoken text. However, the problem says "dialog", which typically means between characters. But the instruction says "spoken text", so we include any spoken text.

 But let's see: the line has "咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天劍？！" which is an exclamation by the narrator. So it is spoken text. However, note that the line is a mix of narrative and the exclamation. The exclamation is in the line. So we output this line.

 However, wait: the problem says "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". This line does contain spoken text (the exclamation). So we output it.

 But note: the problem says "Only trigger when the input obviously matches the query, i.e. not tangentially related." The exclamation is clearly spoken.

 However, let's check the example: in line 8, we had two quoted parts. Here, the exclamation is not in quotes? Actually, it's written as "咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天劍？！" without quotes. But in Chinese, exclamations in narrative are often written without quotes. So we consider it as spoken text.

 But note: the problem says "dialog or spoken text", so exclamations are spoken.

 However, let's compare with the examples we have. The problem states that we should only trigger when obviously matching. The exclamation in line 35 is clearly spoken by the narrator.

 But wait: the problem says "dialog", which usually implies conversation between characters. However, the query says "dialog or spoken text", so we include any spoken text (including exclamations and monologues).

 So we output line 35.

 Line 36: empty -> skip.

 Line 37: "呢把劍係當年黨主席賜我嘅禮物，劍身刻有「HARRRR～！！！」嘅洋文，極為霸氣。" -> This is narrative. The part in quotes "「HARRRR～！！！」" is not spoken by a character in the story (it's a description of the inscription). So we skip.

 Line 38: empty -> skip.

 Line 39: "「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 我抑壓心抵嘅震驚，若無其事咁問。" -> The quoted part "「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」" is clearly spoken text. So we output this line.

 Line 40: empty -> skip.

 Line 41: "「！！！」 黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我。佢點都估唔到我認得呢把劍。原來係熔癌派人追殺我。" -> The quoted part "「！！！」" is an exclamation (like "What?!" or "Oh!"), so it's spoken text. So we output this line.

 Line 42: empty -> skip.

 Line 43: "我望住呢個嚟刺殺我嘅黑衣女人，定睛細看，確定咗我心底嘅疑惑之後，緩慢咁講：" -> This line ends with "緩慢咁講：", meaning "spoke slowly:". So it's introducing a spoken line. However, the actual spoken text is on the next line (line 46). So this line itself does not contain the spoken text, but it says that the character is about to speak. The problem says: "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". This line does not contain the actual dialog, it only says that the character is speaking. So we skip.

 Line 44: empty -> skip.

 Line 45: empty -> skip.

 Line 46: "「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」" -> This is a quoted line, so it's spoken text. Output.

 Line 47: empty -> skip.

 Line 48: "「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔，我忽然醒起熔癌唔識英文。" -> The quoted part "「？？？」" is an exclamation (like "What?!" or "Huh?"), so it's spoken text. Output.

 Line 49: empty -> skip.

 Line 50: "「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」" -> Quoted line, spoken text. Output.

 Line 51: empty -> skip.

 Line 52: "【完】" -> This is a closing note, not dialog.

 Now, let's list the lines we are going to output:

 Line 8: "「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」"
 Line 26: "「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」"
 Line 28: "「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。難怪我同佢對打可以力拔山河。平時我邊有咁大力？佢口裡強硬，卻一個翻身跳出牆外，似乎想逃走。"
 Line 33: "我提劍急追，佢見我迫近，回身一劍，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕。"
 Line 35: "此時大雨已經停止，烏雲漸散。月光之下見到黑衣人喺泥地上不斷掙扎，卻已經無力起身再戰。黑衣人嘅臉相有點似曾相識，我再望返佢把劍，大吃一驚。咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天劍？！"
 Line 39: "「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 我抑壓心抵嘅震驚，若無其事咁問。"
 Line 41: "「！！！」 黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我。佢點都估唔到我認得呢把劍。原來係熔癌派人追殺我。"
 Line 46: "「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」"
 Line 48: "「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔，我忽然醒起熔癌唔識英文。"
 Line 50: "「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」"

 However, note: in line 35, the exclamation "咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天劍？！" is not in quotes, but it's clearly spoken. We are including it.

 But let's double-check: the problem says "dialog or spoken text". The exclamation is spoken, so it should be included.

 Now, we output each matching line with its line number, and then a "---" after each.

 Important: The problem says "output the line (together with line number) only", so we output:
 [line number]: [the line]

 And then a "---" after each.

 However, note: the problem says "For every line in the input, output the line (together with line number) only if the line has something that matches the given query/description, otherwise ignore the line."

 So we output:

8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」
---
26:「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」
---
28:「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。難怪我同佢對打可以力拔山河。平時我邊有咁大力？佢口裡強硬，卻一個翻身跳出牆外，似乎想逃走。
---
33:我提劍急追，佢見我迫近，回身一劍，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕。
---
35:此時大雨已經停止，烏雲漸散。月光之下見到黑衣人喺泥地上不斷掙扎，卻已經無力起身再戰。黑衣人嘅臉相有點似曾相識，我再望返佢把劍，大吃一驚。咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天劍？！
---
39:「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 我抑壓心抵嘅震驚，若無其事咁問。
---
41:「！！！」 黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我。佢點都估唔到我認得呢把劍。原來係熔癌派人追殺我。
---
46:「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」
---
48:「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔，我忽然醒起熔癌唔識英文。
---
50:「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」

 But note: the problem says "Only trigger when the input obviously matches the query, i.e. not tangentially related." We have to be cautious about lines that might be borderline.

 Let's reconsider:

 - Line 4: "「轟隆！」" -> We skipped because it's an onomatopoeic sound, not spoken by a character. Correct.
 - Line 12: "「轟隆！」 呢次雷聲，果然帶來傾盤大雨，屋外屋頂雨聲不絕。" -> We skipped because the quoted part is the thunder sound, not dialog. Correct.
 - Line 23: "腳步聲越嚟越近，我腰間寶劍出鞘嘅一刻，廳門已經「嘭！」一聲被踢爆。" -> We skipped because "「嘭！」" is an onomatopoeic sound (door being kicked), not spoken. Correct.
 - Line 37: "呢把劍係當年黨主席賜我嘅禮物，劍身刻有「HARRRR～！！！」嘅洋文，極為霸氣。" -> We skipped because the quoted part is an inscription, not spoken. Correct.

 Now, about line 35: the exclamation "咦！呢把咪係我以前嘅倚天劍？！" is spoken by the narrator. The problem says "spoken text", so we include it.

 However, note: the problem says "dialog", which typically means between characters. But the query says "dialog or spoken text", so we include any spoken text (including the narrator's exclamations). So we keep line 35.

 But let's check the problem statement: "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". The word "spoken text" is included, so we are safe.

 Now, we output the lines as above.

 Important: The problem says "If no lines match just give empty response." But we have lines.

 We output each matching line with the line number and the line, then a "---".

 Let's write the output accordingly.
