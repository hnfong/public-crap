Okay, the user wants me to write the story of the three little pigs exclusively in emoji. No text allowed. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I need to recall the classic three little pigs story: three pigs build houses (straw, sticks, bricks), wolf blows down first two houses, fails on brick house, then tries chimney but gets boiled. Key elements to represent with emojis.

Hmm, the challenge is conveying narrative through symbols alone. I'll need to sequence emojis to show progression. Maybe start with pig emojis building different houses - 🌾 for straw, 🌿 for sticks, 🧱 for bricks. Wolf should be 🐺 with blowing action 💨.

Important to show cause-effect: weak houses collapsing (💥), safe house resisting. For the chimney part... maybe 🐺➡️🕳️ then 🔥🍲 to imply falling into pot. Happy ending with 🎉.

Should I add details? Like first pig dancing 🕺 before wolf comes? Or steam from brick house kettle 🫧? Might make it more creative as requested.

Wait - must avoid any text characters. Only pure emojis. Need to check each symbol is standard emoji. No custom sequences.

Structure idea:
1. Three pigs 👷🐷👷🐷👷🐷
2. Building phases (straw/sticks/bricks)
3. Wolf arrival 🐺👉
4. Destruction sequence 💨💥 for first two
5. Failed attack on brick house 💨❌
6. Chimney trap 🕳️➡️🔥
7. Celebration 🎈

Better make it more vivid. Maybe:
🐷1: 🌾➡️🏠💨 (shows house blowing away)
🐷2: 🌿➡️🏠💨
🐷3: 🧱➡️🏠💪

For wolf's chimney attempt: 🐺⬇️🕳️ then 😱🔥🍲

Ending with pigs safe 🐷🐷🐷💃 and wolf gone 👻

Should I add the "I'll huff and puff" part? Maybe through repeated 💨💨💨

Also need to show time passing between events. Maybe sun/moon 🌞🌙?

Let me sketch full sequence:

🐷🐷🐷🌞
1️⃣🌾🏠
2️⃣🌿🏠
3️⃣🧱🏠
🐺💨👉
1️⃣💥😱🏃
2️⃣💥😱🏃
3️⃣🏠💪
🐺💨💨💨❌
🐺🕳️⬇️
😱🔥🍲
🐷🐷🐷🎉
🐺👻

But need to make it flow as continuous story without numbers. Maybe:

🐷🐷🐷🌞
👷‍♂️🌾➡️🏠
👷‍♂️🌿➡️🏠
👷‍♂️🧱➡️🏠
🐺👉💨
🏠🌾💥😱🏃💨
🏠🌿💥😱🏃💨
🏠🧱💪
🐺💨💨💨❌
🐺⬇️🕳️
😱🔥🍲💦
🐷🐷🐷💃🍾
🐺☁️😭

Wait, "cloud crying" for wolf might not be clear. Better use tombstone ⚰️ or ghost 👻 for dead wolf.

Also should show pigs entering houses: 🐷➡️🏠

And the brick house having a pot: 🧱🏠🫧

Let me refine:

🌾🏠💥😱🏃
🌿🏠💥😱🏃
🧱🏠💪

🐺⬇️🕳️
😱🔥🍲
🐷🐷🐷🎉
🐺👻

Hmm missing some cause-effect links. Maybe add:

After houses built:
🐷1️⃣🕺🎶 (carefree)
🐷2️⃣🎸😄
🐷3️⃣🫧🧱 (tending kettle)

Then wolf comes:
🐺👃 "smell" but can't do emoji for smell... maybe 🐺👀🐷

Alternative approach: use directional arrows to show action flow.

Final attempt:

🌞
🐷🌾➡️🏠
🐷🌿➡️🏠
🐷🧱➡️🏠
🐷1️⃣🕺
🐷2️⃣🎸
🐷3️⃣🫧
🐺👉
💨💨💨
🏠🌾💥😱🏃
🏠🌿💥😱🏃
🏠🧱💪
🐺😠
🐺⬇️🕳️
😱🔥🍲
🐷🐷🐷🍾
🐺👻

But numbers might be confusing. Better avoid 1️⃣2️⃣3️⃣ since user said no text. Use positions instead.

Left pig = straw, middle = sticks, right = bricks.

So:

🌞
🐷➡️🌾🏠 (left)
🐷➡️🌿🏠 (middle)
🐷➡️🧱🏠 (right)
🐷💃 (left)
🐷🎶 (middle)
🐷🫧 (right)
🐺👉
💨💨💨
🌾🏠💥😱 (left pig runs)
🌿🏠💥😱 (middle runs)
🧱🏠💪 (right stands firm)
🐺😠
🐺⬇️🕳️
😱🔥🍲
🐷🐷🐷🎉
🐺👻

Yes this shows spatial arrangement through sequence. The running pigs come before the standing one.

For the pot scene: maybe add 🫧➡️🔥 to show boiling starting.

And wolf's descent: 🐺🕳️⬇️🔥

Let me compile full sequence without explanations:

🌞
🐷🌾🏠
🐷🌿🏠
🐷🧱🏠
🐷🕺
🐷🎸
🐷🫧
🐺👉
💨💨💨
🌾🏠💥😱🏃
🌿🏠💥😱🏃
🧱🏠💪
🐺😠
🐺🕳️⬇️
🔥🍲
😱
🐷🐷🐷🍾
🐺👻

Wait "😱" after pot might imply pigs scared, but it's wolf who should be scared. Need to show wolf in pot.

Better:

🧱🏠🫧🔥
🐺⬇️🕳️
😱🐺🔥🍲
🐷🐷🐷🎉

Yes! The scream is wolf's.

Final version:

🌞
🐷➡️🌾🏠
🐷➡️🌿🏠
🐷➡️🧱🏠
🐷🕺
🐷🎶
🐷🫧
🐺👉
💨💨💨
🌾🏠💥😱🏃
🌿🏠💥😱🏃
🧱🏠💪
🐺😠
🧱🏠🫧🔥
🐺⬇️🕳️
😱🐺🔥🍲
🐷🐷🐷🍾
🐺👻

This tells the whole story: building, carefree pigs, wolf attack, two houses fall, brick house resists, wolf tries chimney, falls into boiling pot, pigs celebrate, wolf dead.

Added 🫧 for steam before the trap is set. The "😱🐺" shows wolf's scream in pot.

Should be clear enough through emoji logic. No text used, fully compliant.
