**Note:**  
Some entries are a stretch to fit the letter (like Q and X), as there are few places starting with those letters in classic WoW lore. But all are real locations or named areas from vanilla WoW’s original setting. If you want only strictly named places with the exact letter, Q and X are tricky, but the above should satisfy the creative request!

Let me know if you want only places that actually start with the letter (no creative liberties), or if you want brief explanations for each! [end of text]
