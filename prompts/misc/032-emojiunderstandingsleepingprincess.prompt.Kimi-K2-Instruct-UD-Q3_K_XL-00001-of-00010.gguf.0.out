It’s the story of Snow White, told in emoji:

- 👸🏡👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👑😠 – the jealous queen/step-mother at the castle  
- 👸🪞✨👸🏻👑 – the magic mirror naming Snow White “the fairest”  
- 👸🏻👿🍎⚰️ – disguised queen gives poisoned apple; Snow White falls into death-like sleep  
- 🐻🐿️🐦👸😴 – forest animals and the seven dwarfs watch over her glass coffin  
- 🤴😘💍👸💖 – the prince wakes her with a kiss, proposes, and they wed

It instantly evokes Disney’s 1937 film “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” the first full-length animated feature and still the best-known version of the fairy-tale. [end of text]
