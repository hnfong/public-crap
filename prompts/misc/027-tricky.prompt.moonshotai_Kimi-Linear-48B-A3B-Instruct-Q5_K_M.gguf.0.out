A) No, water does not freeze at -12°C. It freezes at 0°C under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm).

B) If you have a glass of pure water and cool it down to -12°C, it will remain liquid unless it is disturbed or seeded with ice crystals. This is because pure water can supercool below its freezing point without solidifying, but it will freeze if a nucleus (like an ice crystal) is introduced. [end of text]
