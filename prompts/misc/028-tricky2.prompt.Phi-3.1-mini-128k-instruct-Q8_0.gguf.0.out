 Bob is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10 degrees Celsius, water would indeed be in a solid state, but it would not be the typical ice we commonly refer to. Instead, it would be a form of ice known as "supercooled water," which is water that remains liquid below its freezing point. However, this state is unstable, and any disturbance or introduction of an ice nucleation site can cause it to rapidly freeze. [end of text]
