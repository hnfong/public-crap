Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is right. At -10째C, water will indeed freeze. Alice is correct that water freezes at 0째C, but Bob's statement "it freezes" is referring to the fact that water will freeze at temperatures below 0째C, including -10째C. [end of text]
