Both Alice and Bob are correct in their own contexts, but Bob is right in the specific scenario he described.

- **Alice** is correct in stating that water typically freezes at **0 degrees Celsius** under standard conditions (at 1 atmosphere of pressure).

- **Bob** is also correct because water **can** freeze at **-10 degrees Celsius** if it is **supercooled** (a metastable state where liquid water remains unfrozen below 0°C) and then triggered to freeze (e.g., by a disturbance or impurity). Once freezing begins, it rapidly propagates, causing the temperature to jump to 0°C as latent heat is released.

So, Bob is right in the sense that water *can* freeze at -10°C under certain conditions. [end of text]
