Alice is right. The correct temperature at which water freezes is indeed 0 degrees Celsius, not -10 degrees Celsius. The confusion arises from the fact that the freezing point of water is actually 273.15 Kelvin, which is the absolute temperature equivalent of 0 degrees Celsius. Therefore, when we talk about water freezing at -10 degrees Celsius, we're actually referring to the temperature in Kelvin, not Celsius. So, Alice is correct in her assertion.

Explanation:
The Celsius temperature scale is based on the freezing and boiling points of water, which are 0 degrees and 100 degrees, respectively. The Kelvin temperature scale, on the other hand, is based on the absolute zero, which is the lowest possible temperature. The Kelvin equivalent of -10 degrees Celsius is 263.15 Kelvin, not -10 Kelvin. Therefore, when we say water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius, we're actually referring to the temperature in Kelvin, not Celsius.

Alice is correct because she correctly understands the difference between the Celsius and Kelvin temperature scales. She correctly states that the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius, which is equivalent to 273.15 Kelvin.
