[INST] Briefly describe the cases of "R v Cunningham", "R v Caldwell", and "R v G". Then explain their significance and impact on modern UK law.

Make it as detailed as you can.
[/INST] 1. **R v Cunningham [1957] 2 QB 396**

   - **Facts**: Cunningham removed a gas meter from a house to steal the money inside. Gas escaped from the broken pipe and seeped into the house next door, where an elderly woman was sleeping. The woman was found unconscious and later died. Cunningham was charged with, among other things, unlawfully and maliciously administering a noxious thing so as to endanger life.

   - **Judgment**: The court held that the word "maliciously" required the defendant to have foreseen that his actions could cause some harm. Since Cunningham did not foresee that his actions could cause injury to someone else, he could not be said to have acted maliciously.

   - **Significance**: This case introduced the concept of "Cunningham recklessness," which requires the defendant to have foreseen that his actions could cause some harm. This is a subjective test, focusing on the defendant's actual state of mind.

2. **R v Caldwell [1982] AC 341**

   - **Facts**: Caldwell set fire to a hotel as an act of revenge against his former employer. The fire spread and caused significant damage to the hotel and adjoining properties. Caldwell was charged with arson and recklessly endangering life.

   - **Judgment**: The House of Lords held that a person acts recklessly if he does an act which in fact creates an obvious risk that property will be destroyed or damaged, and when he does the act he either has not given any thought to the possibility of there being any such risk or has recognized that there was some risk involved and has nonetheless gone on to do it.

   - **Significance**: This case introduced the concept of "Caldwell recklessness," which is an objective test. It focuses on whether a reasonable person would have foreseen the risk, rather than the defendant's actual state of mind. This test was widely criticized for being too harsh, as it could criminalize people who had not actually foreseen any harm.

3. **R v G [2003] UKHL 50**

   - **Facts**: Two boys, aged 11 and 12, set fire to some newspapers in a shop. The fire spread and caused significant damage. The boys were charged with arson and recklessly endangering life.

   - **Judgment**: The House of Lords overruled the Caldwell test, stating that it was not satisfactory to impose criminal liability on a person who had not been proved to be subjectively reckless. They reinstated the subjective test from Cunningham.

   - **Significance**: This case marked a return to the subjective test for recklessness, focusing on the defendant's actual state of mind. It also highlighted the importance of the defendant's capacity to appreciate risk, particularly in the case of children.

**Impact on Modern UK Law**:

- **Subjective Test for Recklessness**: The current law on recklessness in the UK is based on the subjective test, as established in R v Cunningham and reaffirmed in R v G. This means that a defendant must have actually foreseen that his actions could cause some harm.

- **Capacity to Appreciate Risk**: Following R v G, the law takes into account the defendant's capacity to appreciate risk. This is particularly important in cases involving children or people with mental impairments.

- **Abolition of Objective Test**: The objective test for recklessness, as established in R v Caldwell, is no longer part of UK law. This means that a defendant will not be convicted based on what a reasonable person would have foreseen, but rather on what the defendant himself foresaw.

- **Codification**: The Law Commission has proposed a new Criminal Code that would codify the subjective test for recklessness, reflecting the current legal position. However, this has not yet been implemented. [end of text]
