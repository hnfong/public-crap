==========
Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10 degrees Celsius, water is already frozen (as ice). Bob's statement that "water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius" is factually incorrect. 

Bob's follow-up claim ("Yes, but I'm still right") is also incorrect because he is misstating the freezing point of water. The freezing point is a well-established scientific fact, and Alice is right to correct him. 

In short: Alice is right, Bob is wrong.</think>Alice is correct. Water freezes at **0 degrees Celsius** under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10 degrees Celsius, water is already frozen (as ice), not freezing. Bob's statement is factually wrong, and his claim to "still be right" is unsupported. The freezing point of water is a well-established scientific fact.
