Alright, let's tackle this Magic: The Gathering scenario step by step. I'm going to break down the situation, understand the cards involved, and then figure out the optimal plays for both Alice and Bob.

### Understanding the Cards and Initial Setup

**Alice's Hand:**
- Two copies of 'Kindle'.

**Bob's Board:**
- Orim, Samite Healer (1/3, untapped).
  - Ability: {T}: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.

**Bob's Hand:**
- None.

**Mana Situation:**
- Alice has sufficient mana to cast any spells.
- Bob's lands are tapped out (no mana available).

**Game State:**
- It's Alice's turn.
- Orim has been on the battlefield for a while (no summoning sickness, can activate abilities immediately).

### Objective

Alice wants to kill Orim, which has 3 toughness. She needs to deal at least 3 damage to Orim to destroy it. Bob wants to protect Orim by preventing the damage.

### Kindle's Ability

Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards.

- Currently, no Kindles are in any graveyard, so X = 2 for the first Kindle.
- If we cast the first Kindle, it will go to the graveyard, so the next Kindle will see that one in the graveyard, making X = 2 + 1 = 3.

### Possible Plays for Alice

Alice has two Kindles. She can cast one or both. Let's explore the options.

**Option 1: Cast one Kindle.**
- Cast first Kindle, targeting Orim.
  - X = 2 (no Kindles in grave yet).
  - Orim has 3 toughness; 2 damage is dealt, leaving it at 1 toughness.
  - Kindle goes to the graveyard.
- Now, if Alice casts the second Kindle:
  - X = 2 + 1 (one Kindle in grave) = 3.
  - Orim has 1 toughness left; 3 damage would destroy it, but it only has 1, so it would die from the second 3 damage.
  - However, Orim can activate its ability to prevent 3 damage this turn.

**Option 2: Cast both Kindles at once.**
- Cast first Kindle, targeting Orim.
  - X = 2.
  - Orim takes 2 damage, left at 1.
  - Kindle goes to grave.
- Immediately cast second Kindle, targeting Orim.
  - X = 3 (one Kindle in grave).
  - Orim takes 3 damage, but only has 1, so it dies.
  - Orim can activate its ability to prevent 3 damage this turn, but since the first Kindle only dealt 2, it doesn't need to prevent yet. Then the second Kindle would deal 3, but Orim is already dead from the first 2.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Actually, if Alice casts both Kindles:

1. Cast first Kindle, X=2, Orim at 1.
2. Cast second Kindle, X=3, Orim has 1, so it takes 1 damage and dies. The prevention ability isn't relevant here because the total damage is 2 + 1 = 3, but Orim only has 3 toughness, so it dies after the first 2.

But Bob can respond to the second Kindle by activating Orim's ability to prevent 3 damage this turn. Then:

- First Kindle deals 2, no prevention used.
- Orim at 1.
- Second Kindle would deal 3, but Orim prevents 3, so no damage is dealt. Orim survives.

So casting both doesn't guarantee the kill if Bob prevents.

**Option 3: Cast one Kindle, pass priority to see if Bob does anything.**
- Cast first Kindle, X=2, Orim at 1.
- Kindle goes to grave.
- Now, if Bob does nothing, Alice can cast second Kindle, X=3, Orim takes 3, but only has 1, so it dies.
- But if Bob activates Orim's ability in response to the second Kindle, preventing 3 damage this turn:
  - First Kindle dealt 2, no prevention.
  - Second Kindle would deal 3, but Orim prevents it, so Orim survives.

So, Alice needs to ensure that Orim can't prevent the damage that would kill it.

### Optimal Play for Alice

Alice should cast both Kindles in sequence without giving Bob a chance to respond between them. Here's how:

1. Cast first Kindle, targeting Orim.
   - X=2, Orim at 1.
   - Kindle goes to grave.
2. Immediately cast second Kindle, targeting Orim.
   - X=3 (one Kindle in grave).
   - Orim has 1 toughness, so it takes 1 damage and dies.
   - The second 2 damage is irrelevant since Orim is already dead.

Bob cannot activate Orim's ability in response to the second Kindle because the first Kindle has already resolved, putting a Kindle in the graveyard, and the second Kindle is on the stack. By the time Bob gets priority, the second Kindle is already targeting Orim, and its ability is a mana ability (doesn't use the stack), but it can't prevent damage that's already been dealt once the damage is assigned.

Wait, no. Orim's ability is a mana ability only if it doesn't require a target or something, but here it's a tap ability that prevents damage. It uses the stack.

So, if Alice casts both Kindles in quick succession:

- First Kindle resolves, deals 2, Orim at 1, Kindle in grave.
- Second Kindle is cast, on the stack.
- Bob can respond by tapping Orim to prevent 3 damage this turn.
   - Then second Kindle resolves, deals 3, but Orim prevents 3, so no damage is dealt. Orim survives.

So casting both doesn't work if Bob prevents.

Alternative approach: Alice casts one Kindle, and if Bob doesn't prevent, she casts the second. But if Bob does prevent in response to the second, it doesn't help.

Wait, maybe Alice should cast one Kindle, and if Bob doesn't prevent, she can cast the second to kill. If Bob does prevent in response to the first Kindle, then:

- Alice casts first Kindle, targeting Orim.
   - X=2.
   - Orim can tap to prevent 3 damage this turn.
   - So first Kindle would deal 2, but Orim prevents 2 (since it's the next 3 damage, and 2 is within that).
   - Wait, no: Orim prevents the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. If Alice targets Orim with the first Kindle, and Orim prevents, then the next damage to Orim is prevented up to 3.
   - So first Kindle deals 2, Orim prevents 2, Orim takes 0.
   - Then Alice can cast second Kindle, X=3, Orim takes 3, but it can prevent another 3, so it takes 0 again.

So if Bob prevents in response to the first Kindle, Alice can't kill Orim.

Therefore, Alice's best bet is to cast the first Kindle, and if Bob doesn't prevent, cast the second to kill. If Bob does prevent, Alice can't kill Orim this turn.

But since Bob is smart, he would prevent in response to the first Kindle to stop Alice from killing Orim.

Wait, but if Bob doesn't prevent the first Kindle, Alice can cast the second to kill. So Bob must prevent the first Kindle to save Orim.

Therefore, the optimal play is:

Alice casts first Kindle, targeting Orim.
Bob taps Orim to prevent the next 3 damage to any target this turn.
First Kindle resolves, deals 2 damage to Orim, but Orim prevents it, so Orim takes 0.
Alice has second Kindle, but casting it would deal 3, but Orim can prevent another 3, so no damage.
Orim survives.

Alternatively, if Alice casts both Kindles in response:

Cast first Kindle, X=2, on stack.
Cast second Kindle, X=3, on stack.
Bob can respond to second Kindle by tapping Orim to prevent 3.
First Kindle resolves, deals 2, Orim prevents it.
Second Kindle resolves, deals 3,
