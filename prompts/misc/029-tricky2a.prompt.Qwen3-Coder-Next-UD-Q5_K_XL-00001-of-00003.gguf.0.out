Alice is right.

Water freezes at 0°C under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10°C, liquid water *will* freeze—but only if it’s pure and undisturbed; otherwise, it can remain liquid in a metastable state called *supercooled water*. However, the freezing *point* is defined as 0°C, not -10°C. Bob’s statement “It freezes” is vague and misleading—he implies -10°C is the freezing point, which is incorrect. So while water *can* freeze at -10°C, it doesn’t *freeze at* -10°C as a defining property. Alice correctly identifies the standard freezing point. [end of text]
