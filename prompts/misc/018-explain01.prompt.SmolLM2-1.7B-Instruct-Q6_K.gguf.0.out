Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

Yo, let me break it down for ya, my friend
The Federal Reserve, it's like the bank's behind the curtain
They control the money supply, like a puppeteer
And they make decisions that affect the whole country

They set interest rates, like a DJ spinning a track
And they decide when to print more cash, like a rapper with a pack
They're the ones who keep the economy on its feet
And they make sure we don't go bankrupt, like a team of experts

They're the ones who keep the economy stable and strong
And they make sure we don't go bankrupt, like a team of pros
They're the ones who make the decisions, like a DJ spinning a track
And they keep the economy on its feet, like a team of experts

So next time you hear a rapper talk about the Fed
Just remember, they're the ones who keep the economy on its feet
And they make sure we don't go bankrupt, like a team of pros
So next time you hear a rapper talk about the Fed
Just remember, they're the ones who keep the economy on its feet
And they make sure we don't go bankrupt, like a team of experts [end of text]
