Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, but it starts to freeze at -10 degrees Celsius. This is because the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius, but the process of freezing begins at a lower temperature. So, at -10 degrees Celsius, water starts to form ice crystals, and this process continues until the water is completely frozen at 0 degrees Celsius.
