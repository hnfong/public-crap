If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

A theory that proves itself is said to be "consistent" if it does not contain any contradictions, meaning that it is impossible to derive both a statement and its negation from the theory. A theory is considered "tautological" if it is always true regardless of the interpretation of its symbols. 

However, a theory that proves itself is not necessarily tautological or consistent. For instance, a theory could prove itself by including as an axiom a statement that asserts its own consistency or truth. This is known as a "self-referential" theory. 

A famous example of a self-referential theory is GÃ¶del's first incompleteness theorem, which shows that any sufficiently powerful and consistent formal system is incomplete, meaning that there are true statements that cannot be proved within the system. The theorem itself can be seen as a self-referential statement, as it proves the incompleteness of the system that includes it as an axiom. 

Another example is the theory of Quine's "New Foundations" (NF), which includes an axiom that asserts the existence of a universal set (i.e., a set that contains all other sets). This axiom is self-referential, as it asserts the existence of a set that contains itself. Despite this, NF is consistent (although not known to be consistent with classical logic). 

In general, a theory that proves itself is not necessarily problematic, but it can raise concerns about the circularity of the proof or the adequacy of the theory. The consistency of a theory is a crucial aspect of its soundness and reliability, but it does not guarantee that the theory is true or useful in practice.
