This song tells a fantastical story about a mysterious, whimsical restaurant hidden in the forest. Here's an interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting:

In a deep, enchanted forest, there's a small, elusive restaurant that can't be reached by following acorns (ドングリ). The restaurant is always empty, with no reservations and plenty of empty seats. The patrons are few, and the only signs of life are the birds laughing (パタパタ笑ってる) and a dancing small bear cub (手乗りの子熊).

The restaurant has a bright red corrugated iron roof (真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根), and the only item on the menu is the chef's recommendation (メニューはおすすめ そればかり). Strange music, like a string quartet, can be heard from the kitchen (厨房の方から聞こえてる バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ).

The staff welcomes guests warmly (ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい) and encourages them to eat their fill (たらふく食べたらお眠りよ). After the meal, they bid farewell (さようなら), implying that guests might not remember the restaurant or their visit the next day (明日は明日で エトセトラ).

The kitchen staff is busy (右から左へおおわらわ), preparing a variety of dishes like carpaccio, paella, risotto, and hors d'oeuvres (カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル リゾット). Despite the abundance of food, there's no dessert (デザートはありません).

In a chilling twist, the restaurant offers to deliver meals even to the graves (お墓の中まで届けましょう), suggesting that this might be the guests' last meal (今宵は最後のフルコース).

In this fantastical setting, the restaurant could be a magical, otherworldly place that appears and disappears at will, luring in unsuspecting guests for one last feast before they meet their end. The empty pockets (空っぽのポケット) and forgotten people (忘れた人から辿り着く) could imply that the guests have no money or belongings, further emphasizing the eerie atmosphere of this enchanted forest restaurant.

Here's a rough translation of the lyrics:

Following acorns won't get you there
A small restaurant in the forest
Fiddling with empty pockets
Arriving from someone forgotten
There are no reservations
A small restaurant in the forest
Lunchtime with plenty of empty seats
Little birds are laughing "pata pata"

A bright red corrugated iron roof
The menu is just the recommended dish
From the kitchen, you can hear
Violin, flute, cello, viola

Welcome, welcome, come in
After eating your fill, you'll fall asleep
Then goodbye everyone
Tomorrow is tomorrow, etc.

Busy from right to left
Even a small bear cub starts dancing
Carpaccio, paella, hors d'oeuvres
Risotto, no dessert
We'll deliver even to the grave
Tonight is the last full course [end of text]
