Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

assistant
Alice is correct. Water at -10 degrees Celsius freezes, while at 0 degrees Celsius it does not. This is a fundamental property of water, which is why it is important to avoid freezing water when it is not needed. [end of text]
