**A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?**  
Yes, under standard atmospheric pressure, water freezes at 0°C. However, at -12°C, which is significantly below the freezing point, water will definitely be frozen (as ice).

**B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?**  
If the water is cooled to -12°C, it will freeze into ice. Pure water can supercool to just below 0°C under ideal conditions (without any nucleation sites), but once it starts freezing, the process will complete, and the entire sample will turn to ice at -12°C. [end of text]
