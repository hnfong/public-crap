A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric conditions.

B) If you have a glass of pure water and it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, the water will not freeze. Water will remain in its liquid state until it reaches its freezing point of 0 degrees Celsius. At -12 degrees Celsius, the water will be in a supercooled state, meaning it is below its freezing point but has not yet formed ice crystals. If you were to add a small amount of ice or a nucleating agent (such as a speck of dust), the water would freeze rapidly and form ice crystals. However, without such a nucleating agent, the water will remain in its liquid state until it reaches 0 degrees Celsius. [end of text]
