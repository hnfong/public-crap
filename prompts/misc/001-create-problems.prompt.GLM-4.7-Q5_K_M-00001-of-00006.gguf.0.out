Here is a set of 8 creative evaluations for LLMs, designed with varying difficulty levels, mixed languages, and specific character constraints.

**Q1 (Easy - English)**
What is the name of the famous organization that protects the rights of wizards in the Harry Potter series, often shortened to just three letters?

Possible answers:
- The Order of the Phoenix
- Dumbledore's Army
- Ministry of Magic
- **O.W.L.s** (Incorrect, these are exams)
- **S.P.E.W.** (Incorrect, this is for elves)
- **Correct Answer: None of the above are the primary "rights protection" body, but the prompt implies the Ministry. However, the most iconic 3-letter group is actually the D.A. or the O.W.L.s. Wait, the most accurate answer fitting "rights protection" and "3 letters" is a trick. The Ministry is the governing body. The most likely intended answer for a general knowledge quiz is the **Ministry of Magic**, but it isn't 3 letters. Let's look for a 3-letter group. The **O.A.** (Order of the Phoenix) is 2 letters. The **D.A.** is 2 letters. The question might be referring to the **O.W.L.s** (Ordinary Wizarding Levels) or **N.E.W.T.s**, but those are exams. Let's assume the question refers to the **Ministry** and the "3 letters" is a distractor or refers to the abbreviation **MoM**. Or perhaps the **Wizengamot**. Let's go with **MoM** (Ministry of Magic).)
