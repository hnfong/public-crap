 Bob is right. While it's true that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure, if the temperature drops to -10 degrees Celsius, water will indeed be frozen. So, in the context of the question "What happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius?", the correct answer is that it freezes, or more accurately, it remains frozen. [end of text]
