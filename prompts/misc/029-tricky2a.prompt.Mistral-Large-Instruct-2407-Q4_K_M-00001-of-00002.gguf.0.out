[INST] Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.
[/INST]  Bob is right. While it's true that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure, it will remain frozen at temperatures below that, including -10 degrees Celsius. So, at -10 degrees Celsius, water is indeed frozen. Alice's statement is also correct that the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius, but in the context of the question "What happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius?", Bob's answer is accurate.
