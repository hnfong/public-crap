Both Alice and Bob are partially correct, but Bob is more accurate in this context.

At **-10 degrees Celsius**, pure water *has already frozen* (it would have frozen at 0°C under standard conditions). However, Bob’s statement—**"It freezes"**—implies the *process* of freezing, which can still occur at -10°C if water is being cooled further (e.g., supercooled water suddenly crystallizing).

Alice is technically right about the *equilibrium freezing point* of pure water (0°C), but Bob’s answer accounts for the broader interpretation of "freezing" as a dynamic process. So, Bob is correct in a practical sense. [end of text]
