<think>
We are writing a story exclusively in emojis. The protagonist must resemble the classical Snow White, so we'll include elements like the poisoned apple, the seven dwarfs, the evil queen, etc. But we must use only emojis and no words.

Let's plan the story:

1. Introduction: Snow White (a young princess with white skin, red lips, black hair) - we can represent her with a 👑 (crown) and maybe a 🧡 (heart) for her beauty, but note: we can't use words. So we have to rely on emojis that are universally recognized.

However, note: the instruction says "write exclusively in emoji". So we cannot write any words. We must use only emojis to tell the story.

We need to represent:
- Snow White: 🧚‍♀️ (but note: fairy is not exactly Snow White, but it's a common representation) or maybe 👑 (crown) and 🍎 (apple) but that's not her. Alternatively, we can use a 👧 (girl) with a 🧡 (heart) and maybe a 👗 (dress) but that's not standard.

Actually, let's think of standard emoji representations for the story:

- Snow White: We can use a 👧 (girl) and then add some context. But note: we can't write words. So we have to rely on the sequence.

But the problem: how to represent "Snow White" without words? We can use the emoji for a princess: 👸 (princess) or 👑 (crown) and then a 🧡 (heart) for her beauty? However, the classic Snow White is often depicted with a red dress and black hair, but we don't have an emoji for that.

Alternatively, we can use a sequence that tells the story without naming her. We'll have:

- A queen (the evil one) who is jealous: 👑 (queen) and then a mirror: 🪞 (mirror) and then the mirror says she's the fairest: 🪞➡️👑 (but we can't write arrows, so we have to use the emojis in order).

Wait, we can only use emojis. So we have to arrange them in a sequence that tells the story.

Let me try to outline the story in emoji:

1. The queen (evil) is jealous of Snow White's beauty: 👑 (queen) 👁️ (eye) 👁️ (eye) 👁️ (eye) but that's not standard. Instead, we can use: 👑 (queen) 🪞 (mirror) and then the mirror says she's the fairest: 🪞➡️👑 (but we can't write arrows, so we have to use the mirror emoji and then the queen's reaction). Actually, we can use: 👑 (queen) 🪞 (mirror) 👁️ (eye) 👁️ (eye) 👁️ (eye) and then a 😡 (angry face) because she's jealous.

But note: the mirror says "you are the fairest in the land", so we can represent that by having the mirror and then the queen being angry.

2. The queen orders the huntsman to kill Snow White: 👑 (queen) 🗡️ (knife) 👧 (girl) but then the huntsman doesn't kill her: 🗡️ (knife) 👧 (girl) 🌲 (tree) 🌳 (tree) and then the huntsman lets her go: 👧 (girl) 🌲 (tree) 🌳 (tree) 🏃‍♀️ (running away).

3. Snow White finds the dwarfs' cottage: 👧 (girl) 🏡 (house) 👶 (dwarf? but note: there are seven dwarfs, so we can use 👶 for dwarf? Actually, the dwarf emoji is 👴 (old man) but that's not exactly. There's a dwarf emoji: 🧝 (elf) but that's not a dwarf. Alternatively, we can use 👶 (baby) to represent the dwarfs? But that's not accurate. However, in emoji, we don't have a specific dwarf. So we'll use 👶 for the dwarfs? Or maybe we can use seven 👶? But that would be messy.

Alternatively, we can use the emoji for a cottage: 🏡 and then the dwarfs: we can use seven 👶 (baby) but that's not standard. Another idea: the dwarfs are often named, but we don't have to. We can just have a cottage and then a group of dwarfs. But we can't represent seven with an emoji. So we'll use one 👶 and then the context of the story.

Wait, there's an emoji for a dwarf: it's actually not standard, but we can use the elf emoji 🧝 and then say there are seven by having seven of them? But we can't write numbers. So we'll have to imply it.

But note: the instruction says "you may be creative as you want". So we can be flexible.

Let me try to write the story step by step:

- The queen is the fairest: 👑 (queen) 🪞 (mirror) 👁️ (eye) 👁️ (eye) 👁️ (eye) 😍 (smiling face) but then she sees Snow White and gets angry: 👑 (queen) 😡 (angry face) 🍎 (apple) (because the poisoned apple is a key element) and then she orders the huntsman: 👑 (queen) 🗡️ (knife) 👧 (girl) (meaning: kill the girl).

- The huntsman takes Snow White to the forest: 👧 (girl) 🌲 (forest) 🌳 (tree) 🗡️ (knife) but then he doesn't kill her: 👧 (girl) 🌲 (forest) 🌳 (tree) 🤝 (handshake? but that's not right) or maybe he lets her go: 👧 (girl) 🌲 (forest) 🌳 (tree) 🏃‍♀️ (running away).

- Snow White finds the cottage: 👧 (girl) 🏡 (cottage) 👶 (dwarf) 👶 (dwarf) 👶 (dwarf) 👶 (dwarf) 👶 (dwarf) 👶 (dwarf) 👶 (dwarf) (but that's seven babies, which is a bit odd, but it's the only way to represent seven dwarfs with emojis). Alternatively, we can use one 👶 and then the cottage, and the story implies seven.

- The dwarfs welcome her: 👧 (girl) 👶 (dwarf) 👶 (dwarf) 👶 (dwarf) 👶 (dwarf) 👶 (dwarf) 👶 (dwarf) 👶 (dwarf) 👋 (wave) 😊 (smile).

- The queen makes a poisoned apple: 👑 (queen) 🍎 (apple) 💀 (skull) (for poison) and then she disguises as an old woman: 👑 (queen) 👵 (old woman) 🍎 (apple) (but the queen is the one making it, so we can have 👑 (queen) 🍎 (apple) 💀 (skull) and then she goes to the cottage: 👵 (old woman) 🍎 (apple) 🏡 (cottage).

- Snow White takes the apple: 👧 (girl) 👵 (old woman) 🍎 (apple) 🤤 (yawn) but then she bites it: 👧 (girl) 🍎 (apple) 👄 (mouth) and then falls asleep: 👧 (girl) 💤 (sleeping).

- The prince comes: 👑 (prince) 👑 (crown) 👑 (crown) (but we don't have a prince emoji, so we can use 👑 for prince? Or a 👨 (man) with a crown? Actually, there's a prince emoji: 👑 (crown) and then 👨 (man) but we can use 👑 for prince). So: 👑 (prince) 👧 (girl) 💤 (sleeping) and then he kisses her: 👑 (prince) 👄 (mouth) 👧 (girl) 💤 (sleeping) and then she wakes up: 👧 (girl) 😊 (smile) 👑 (prince) 👰 (bride? but that's not necessary, but it's a happy ending).

But note: the classical story has the prince waking her with a kiss.

However, we must be careful: the story must be told without words, so we have to arrange the emojis in a sequence that makes sense.

Let me write the entire story as a sequence of emojis:

👑 🪞 👁️ 👁️ 👁️ 😍 😡 🍎 🗡️ 👧 👧 🌲 🌳 🏃‍♀️ 👧 🏡 👶 👶 👶 👶 👶 👶 👶 👋 😊 👑 🍎 💀 👵 🍎 🏡 👧 👵 🍎 👄 💤 👑 👄 👧 💤 😊

But wait, that's a bit messy. Let's break it down:

1. Queen and mirror: 👑 🪞 👁️ 👁️ 👁️ 😍
   - The queen looks in the mirror and sees she's the fairest (so the mirror shows her, and she's happy).

2. Then she gets angry: 😡
   - So: 👑 🪞 👁️ 👁️ 👁️ 😍 😡

3. She orders the huntsman to kill Snow White: 🍎 (the poisoned apple is coming, but the order is about killing) so we have: 😡 🗡️ 👧 (meaning: the queen orders the huntsman to kill the girl with a knife).

4. The huntsman takes her to the forest: 👧 🌲 🌳 (the girl in the forest)

5. But he doesn't kill her: 👧 🌲 🌳 🏃‍♀️ (she runs away)

6. She finds the cottage: 👧 🏡

7. The dwarfs: 👶 (seven times, but we'll write seven 👶 emojis) so: 👧 🏡 👶 👶 👶 👶 👶 👶 👶

8. They welcome her: 👋 😊

9. The queen makes the poisoned apple: 👑 🍎 💀 (queen, apple, skull for poison)

10. She disguises as an old woman: 👵 (old woman)

11. She goes to the cottage: 👵 🍎 🏡

12. Snow White takes the apple: 👧 👵 🍎

13. She bites it: 👄 (mouth) and falls asleep: 💤

14. The prince comes: 👑 (prince) and then he kisses her: 👑 👄 👧 💤

15. She wakes up: 😊

But note: the prince is usually not a queen, so we use 👑 for prince? Actually, the prince is a man with a crown, so we can use 👑 (crown) and then a 👨 (man) but we don't have to. We'll use 👑 for the prince.

However, the sequence above is long. We have to write it as a continuous string of emojis.

But note: the instruction says "write a story", so we can write it as a sequence.

Let me write the entire sequence:

👑 🪞 👁️ 👁️ 👁️ 😍 😡 🗡️ 👧 👧 🌲 🌳 🏃‍♀️ 👧 🏡 👶 👶 👶 👶 👶 👶 👶 👋 😊 👑 🍎 💀 👵 🍎 🏡 👧 👵 🍎 👄 💤 👑 👄 👧 💤 😊

Wait, but the queen making the apple: we have 👑 🍎 💀, then she disguises: 👵, then she goes to the cottage: 👵 🍎 🏡. Then Snow White takes the apple: 👧 👵 🍎. Then she bites: 👄, then sleeps: 💤.

But note: the queen is the one who made the apple, so we have to show that. So the sequence for the apple part: 👑 🍎 💀 (queen makes the poisoned apple) then 👵 (queen disguises as old woman) then 👵 🍎 🏡 (old woman goes to the cottage with the apple) then 👧 👵 🍎 (Snow White takes the apple from the old woman) then 👄 💤 (she bites and falls asleep).

Also, the dwarfs: we have seven 👶, but that's a lot. We can try to represent the dwarfs with one 👶 and then the cottage, but the story is about seven. However, we are limited by emojis. So we'll use seven.

But note: the emoji for baby is 👶, and it's commonly used to represent dwarfs in emoji stories. So we'll go with that.

Now, let's write the entire story as a string of emojis:

👑🪞👁️👁️👁️😍😡🗡️👧👧🌲🌳🏃‍♀️👧🏡👶👶👶👶👶👶👶👋😊👑🍎💀👵🍎🏡👧👵🍎👄💤👑👄👧💤😊

Wait, but we have to make sure it's a continuous string without spaces? Actually, the instruction doesn't say, but in emoji, we can write them without spaces. However, for readability in the response, we might put spaces. But the instruction says "write exclusively in emoji", so we should write without any words, and the emojis should be adjacent? But in practice, we write them as a sequence.

But note: the assistant's response must be only emojis. So we'll output a string of emojis.

However, the problem: the sequence might be too long and hard to read, but that's the requirement.

Let me check if we missed anything:

- The queen is jealous: we have the mirror and then the queen being happy and then angry.
- The huntsman: we have the knife and the girl, then the girl running away.
- The cottage: the girl finds the cottage and the seven dwarfs (seven babies).
- The dwarfs welcome her: wave and smile.
- The queen makes the poisoned apple: queen, apple, skull.
- The queen disguises: old woman.
- The queen goes to the cottage with the apple: old woman, apple, cottage.
- Snow White takes the apple: girl, old woman, apple.
- She bites and falls asleep: mouth, sleeping.
- The prince comes and kisses: prince (crown), mouth, girl, sleeping.
- She wakes up: smile.

But note: the prince is not in the classical story as a character that appears until the end, so we have to include him.

Wait, in the classical story, the prince is the one who finds her and kisses her. So we have to include him.

But we have a problem: the queen is represented by 👑, and the prince is also represented by 👑. How to distinguish? We can't. So we'll have to rely on context. The queen is the one making the apple and being angry, and the prince is the one who comes at the end.

So the sequence:

- The queen: 👑 (at the beginning, when she's the queen)
- The prince: 👑 (at the end, when he's the prince)

But it's the same emoji. However, in the story, it's clear from the context.

Alternatively, we can use a different emoji for the prince? There's a prince emoji: it's actually not standard, but we can use 👑 for both. It's common in emoji stories to use the crown for royalty.

So we'll go with that.

Now, let's write the entire sequence without spaces (as a continuous string of emojis) but note: in the response, we can write them as a string.

But note: the instruction says "write exclusively in emoji", so we must not write any words. So we output only the emojis.

However, the problem: the sequence I have is:

👑🪞👁️👁️👁️😍😡🗡️👧👧🌲🌳🏃‍♀️👧🏡👶👶👶👶👶👶👶👋😊👑🍎💀👵🍎🏡👧👵🍎👄💤👑👄👧💤😊

Wait, but we have two 👧 in the huntsman part: we have 🗡️ 👧 (the order) and then 👧 🌲 🌳 (the girl going to the forest). So we have two 👧: one for the order and one for the girl. But that's okay.

But let me count the emojis:

1. 👑
2. 🪞
3. 👁️
4. 👁️
5. 👁️
6. 😍
7. 😡
8. 🗡️
9. 👧 (the order: kill the girl)
10. 👧 (the girl in the forest)
11. 🌲
12. 🌳
13. 🏃‍♀️
14. 👧 (the girl at the cottage)
15. 🏡
16. 👶 (dwarf 1)
17. 👶 (dwarf 2)
18. 👶 (dwarf 3)
19. 👶 (dwarf 4)
20. 👶 (dwarf 5)
21. 👶 (dwarf 6)
22. 👶 (dwarf 7)
23. 👋
24. 😊
25. 👑 (queen making the apple)
26. 🍎
27. 💀
28. 👵
29. 🍎
30. 🏡
31. 👧
32. 👵
33. 🍎
34. 👄
35. 💤
36. 👑 (prince)
37. 👄
38. 👧
39. 💤
40. 😊

That's 40 emojis.

But note: the queen making the apple: we have 👑 🍎 💀, so that's three. Then she disguises: 👵 (so that's the 28th). Then she goes to the cottage: 👵 🍎 🏡 (29,30,31? but we already have the cottage at 15, but it's a new scene). Then Snow White takes the apple: 👧 👵 🍎 (31,32,33). Then she bites: 👄 (34) and sleeps: 💤 (35). Then the prince: 👑 (36), kisses: 👄 (37), girl: 👧 (38), sleeping: 💤 (39), and then she wakes: 😊 (40).

This should be the story.

But note: the classical story has the dwarfs living in the cottage, so the cottage is already there. We don't need to show the cottage again for the queen's visit? But we do: the queen goes to the cottage, so we have to show the cottage again. So we have 🏡 at position 15 and then again at position 30.

Now, we output the string of these emojis without spaces.

But note: the emoji for the mirror is 🪞 (which is a mirror, not a regular mirror emoji, but it's the one we have). The huntsman is represented by the knife, and the girl running.

Let me write the string:

👑🪞👁️👁️👁️😍😡🗡️👧👧🌲🌳🏃‍♀️👧🏡👶👶👶👶👶👶👶👋😊👑🍎💀👵🍎🏡👧👵🍎👄💤👑👄👧💤😊

Wait, but we have two 👧 in a row at positions 9 and 10: that's the order (the queen orders the huntsman to kill the girl) and then the girl (the actual girl) going to the forest. So it's okay.

But note: the emoji for the girl is 👧, and we use it for Snow White. So it's consistent.

Now, we output this string.

However, the instruction says "you must write exclusively in emoji", so we output only this string.

But note: the assistant is supposed to be helpful, but the rule is strict: only emojis.

So we output:

👑🪞👁️👁️👁️😍😡🗡️👧👧🌲🌳🏃‍♀️👧🏡👶👶👶👶👶👶👶👋😊👑🍎💀👵🍎🏡👧👵🍎👄💤👑👄👧💤😊

Wait, but let me check if the emojis are correctly represented in the response. We have to make sure that the emojis are valid.

Let me list them:

- 👑: crown
- 🪞: mirror (this is a newer emoji, but it's standard in Unicode)
- 👁️: eye (with the dot, but it's the eye emoji)
- 😡: angry face
- 🗡️: dagger
- 🌲: evergreen tree
- 🌳: deciduous tree
- 🏃‍♀️: woman running
- 🏡: house
- 👶: baby
- 👋: waving hand
- 😊: smiling face
- 🍎: apple
- 💀: skull
- 👵: old woman
- 👄: mouth
- 💤: sleeping

All these are standard emojis.

So the story is:

Queen (👑) looks in mirror (🪞) with three eyes (👁️👁️👁️) and is happy (😍), then angry (😡), orders the huntsman to kill Snow White (🗡️ 👧), then the girl (👧) runs away (👧 🌲 🌳 🏃‍♀️), finds the cottage (👧 🏡), meets seven dwarfs (👶 seven times), they wave (👋) and smile (😊), then the queen makes a poisoned apple (👑 🍎 💀), disguises as old woman (👵), goes to the cottage (👵 🍎 🏡), Snow White takes the apple (👧 👵 🍎), bites it (👄), falls asleep (💤), then the prince (👑) kisses her (👑 👄 👧 💤), and she wakes up (😊).

This should be the story.

But note: the classical story has the queen making the apple and then going to the cottage. We have that.

We are not including the dwarfs' names or anything else, but we are being creative as allowed.

So we output the string of emojis.

However, the instruction says "you may be creative as you want", so we are allowed to change the order or add elements? But we are following the classical story.

We'll output the string.

But note: the problem says "While your protagonist must resemble the classical Snow White tales", so we are using a girl (👧) as the protagonist, which is Snow White.

So we are good.

Final output:
