This is a visual summary of the fairy tale **"Snow White."**

Here is the breakdown of the story:
1.  **The Jealous Queen:** A princess lives with a family, but the Queen (with the crown) is angry/jealous of her beauty.
2.  **The Magic Mirror:** The Queen asks her mirror who is the fairest, and it shows her the pale princess.
3.  **The Poisoned Apple:** The Queen (disguised as a hag/witch) gives Snow White a poisoned apple, leading to her "death" (coffin).
4.  **The Seven Dwarfs:** Forest animals (bear, squirrel, bird) and the dwarfs watch over her while she sleeps.
5.  **True Love's Kiss:** A Prince arrives, kisses her, and they get engaged (ring).

**Pop Culture Connection:**
This is the plot of Disney's 1937 animated classic **"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."** It also famously parallels the dark fantasy TV series **"Once Upon a Time,"** where the Evil Queen's vendetta against Snow White is the central conflict of the show. [end of text]
