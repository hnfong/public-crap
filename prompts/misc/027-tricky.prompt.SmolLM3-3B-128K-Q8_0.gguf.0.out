A) Yes, water freezes at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure. As the temperature decreases below 0 degrees Celsius, water starts to freeze into ice. At -12 degrees Celsius, water is well below its freezing point, so it will freeze.

B) If you have a glass of pure water and cool it down to -12 degrees Celsius, the water will freeze into ice. Since the temperature is below the freezing point, the water molecules will start to form a crystalline structure, resulting in the formation of ice. The glass may crack or shatter due to the expansion of water as it freezes, but this depends on the glass's thickness and the rate of cooling. If the cooling is slow, the water may freeze gradually, and the glass may not crack. However, if the cooling is rapid, the water may freeze so quickly that it expands and causes the glass to break.
