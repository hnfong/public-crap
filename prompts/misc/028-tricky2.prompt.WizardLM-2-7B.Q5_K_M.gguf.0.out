 USER: Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

ASSISTANT:  Both Alice and Bob are referring to different aspects of water's freezing point.

Alice is correct in stating that water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere). This is the commonly known freezing point of water.

Bob is also correct in stating that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius. However, this is under conditions of increased atmospheric pressure. As pressure on water increases, its freezing point rises. This is why water can freeze at different temperatures in different conditions:

- At sea level, where atmospheric pressure is around 1013 millibars (or 1 atmosphere), water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.
- At a higher pressure, such as in a mountain lake at a higher altitude, where the atmospheric pressure is lower, water can freeze at a higher temperature, such as -10 degrees Celsius.
- Conversely, at the bottom of the ocean, where the pressure is much greater, water can freeze at a lower temperature than 0 degrees Celsius.

So, Bob is right in the context that water can indeed freeze at -10 degrees Celsius, but only under conditions of reduced atmospheric pressure, such as at a high altitude. Alice's statement is more generally accurate for standard conditions at sea level. [end of text]
