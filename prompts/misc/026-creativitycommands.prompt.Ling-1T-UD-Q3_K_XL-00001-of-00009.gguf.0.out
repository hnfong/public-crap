Let's analyze the command step by step and then interpret its **probable output** based on linguistic principles.

### Command Breakdown:
```bash
cat wowfanfic.txt | 
perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }' | 
sort | 
uniq -c | 
sort -n | 
tail -n 20
```

1. `cat wowfanfic.txt`  
   → Outputs the entire text of your fan fiction.

2. `perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'`  
   → `-n` loops over each line.  
   → `split(/\s/)` splits each line on **whitespace** (spaces, tabs, newlines), producing a list of "words" (actually, tokens separated by whitespace).  
   → Then it prints **each token on its own line**.  
   → **Result**: One word/token per line.

3. `sort`  
   → Alphabetically sorts all the tokens (words).

4. `uniq -c`  
   → Counts consecutive duplicate lines, prefixing each with its frequency.  
   → Now you have lines like: `42 the`

5. `sort -n`  
   → Sorts these lines **numerically** by the count (ascending: lowest frequency first).

6. `tail -n 20`  
   → Takes the **last 20 lines**, i.e., the **20 most frequent words** in the text.

### Probable Output

You will see the **20 most frequent words** in your `wowfanfic.txt`, each preceded by its frequency count, sorted from least frequent of the top 20 to most frequent.

Example (hypothetical):
```
  123 and
  135 or
  140 but
  150 of
  160 to
  175 a
  185 the
  200 he
  210 she
  220 his
  230 her
  240 them
  250 they
  260 in
  270 was
  280 it
  290 you
  300 I
  320 said
  350 and
```

Wait — actually, the **last line** would be the **single most frequent word**.

But more realistically, in English-like text (and WoW fanfic is narrative prose), the **most frequent words** will likely be **function words** (grammatical glue) rather than content words.

---

### Linguistic Principles at Play

1. **Zipf's Law**  
   → In natural language, a small number of words (like "the", "and", "of") occur very frequently, while the vast majority are rare.  
   → Your pipeline is essentially extracting the **high-frequency tail** of the word distribution — classic Zipfian behavior.

2. **Function Words vs. Content Words**  
   → **Function words** (articles, prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns) are short, grammatical, and appear in almost every sentence.  
   → **Content words** (nouns, verbs, adjectives) carry meaning but are more varied.  
   → So, the **top 20 words** will likely be dominated by:  
      - `the`, `and`, `of`, `to`, `a`, `in`, `he`, `she`, `it`, `they`, `was`, `is`, `are`, `his`, `her`, `said`, etc.

3. **Tokenization Artifacts**  
   → `split(/\s/)` is naive: it doesn’t remove punctuation. So `"sword."`, `"sword,"`, `"sword!"` would be counted as different tokens.  
   → But **high-frequency words** are often short and grammatical, so even with punctuation, `the`, `and`, etc., will still dominate because they appear in clean form often.

4. **Narrative Bias in Fanfic**  
   → WoW fanfic likely involves dialogue → high frequency of `said`, `asked`, `shouted`.  
   → Third-person narration → pronouns (`he`, `she`, `they`) and names (e.g., `Thrall`, `Jaina`) might appear, but unless a name is extremely common, **function words still win**.

### Most Likely Top Words

Given all this, the **probable output** is a list like:
```
  150 and
  160 of
  170 to
  180 a
  190 the
  200 in
  210 he
  220 she
  230 was
  240 it
  250 his
  260 her
  270 they
  280 said
  290 you
  300 I
  310 but
  320 or
  330 for
  350 and
```

Wait — actually, `and` might be #1.

But **the single most frequent word** in most English texts is **"the"**.

So the **last line** will probably be:
```
  350 the
```

---

### Conclusion

**Probable Output**:  
A list of the 20 most frequent **whitespace-separated tokens** in your fanfic, dominated by **function words** (especially `the`, `and`, `of`, `to`, `a`, `in`, pronouns, `said`), sorted by increasing frequency, with the **most frequent word (likely "the") at the bottom**.

This reflects:
- **Zipf’s Law** (few words dominate frequency),
- **Grammatical universals** (function words are short, frequent, necessary),
- **Limitations of simple tokenization** (punctuation may slightly dilute content words),
- **Narrative conventions** (dialogue markers like "said" rise in fiction).

Thus, the command effectively performs a **basic word frequency analysis**, revealing the **grammatical skeleton** of your story. [end of text]
