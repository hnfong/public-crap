Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Give me your interpretation. You do not have to translate the contents, but you may if you wish.

The lyrics seem to tell a whimsical and surreal story about a small, hidden restaurant in the forest. Here's a possible interpretation:

The song begins with the narrator stating that you can't find the restaurant by following acorns, suggesting that it's not a place you can easily locate. Instead, you can only find it by chance, perhaps by following a forgotten path. The restaurant has no reservations, and it's empty during lunchtime, with birds flapping their wings and laughing, which adds to the lighthearted and slightly mischievous tone.

The restaurant has a red-painted tin roof, and the menu only has recommendations, implying that the chef prepares dishes based on what's available or what they feel like cooking. The kitchen is filled with the sounds of classical instruments, suggesting that the atmosphere is lively and entertaining.

The chorus welcomes guests to the restaurant, inviting them to eat their fill and then take a nap. This could be interpreted as a metaphor for enjoying life's pleasures and taking a break from the stresses of everyday life. The chorus then bids farewell to the guests, reminding them that tomorrow is a new day, and anything can happen.

The second verse describes the restaurant's lively atmosphere, with guests moving from right to left and a baby bear dancing along. The menu includes exotic dishes like carpaccio, paella, and hors d'oeuvres, but there's no dessert. The final line suggests that the restaurant will deliver food to the guests even after they've passed away, implying that the restaurant is a place where memories and experiences can last beyond death.

Overall, the song seems to be about a magical and mysterious restaurant that offers a break from reality and a chance to enjoy life's pleasures. The restaurant is a place where anything can happen, and memories can last forever.
