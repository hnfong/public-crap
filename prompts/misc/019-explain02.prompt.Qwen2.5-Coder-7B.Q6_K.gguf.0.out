Explain the role of China's National People Congress to a 5 year old child who lives in London.

assistant
The National People's Congress (NPC) is like a big meeting where all the important people in China come together to make decisions for the country. It's like a big family meeting where everyone gets to talk and decide what to do. In London, there is a similar meeting called the House of Commons, where people from different parts of the country come together to make decisions for the United Kingdom. Both meetings are important because they help make sure that everyone's voice is heard and that the country is run in a fair and just way. [end of text]
