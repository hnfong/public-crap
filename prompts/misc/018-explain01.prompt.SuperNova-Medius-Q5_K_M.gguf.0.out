Yo, listen up, I'm about to drop some knowledge on the Fed,  
It's like the DJ of the economy, making sure the beat's not dead.  
They control the money flow, like a master of the mix,  
Making sure the rhythm's right, no need to switch.

When the economy's slow, they drop some interest rates,  
Like turning up the bass, making the beat more great.  
More money flows, the streets start to heat,  
Businesses grow, and the vibe's complete.

But when it's too hot, and inflation's on the rise,  
They turn down the volume, make the beat more wise.  
They raise those rates, cool things down,  
Keep the economy steady, like a smooth sound.

They also print the paper, make sure there's enough to go,  
But they don't just print willy-nilly, they got a plan, you know.  
They watch the market, like a hawk on the wing,  
Making sure everything's balanced, no need to sing the blues, no sting.

So, that's the Fed, like the DJ of the economy,  
Keeping the beat steady, making sure it's all good, you see.  
They got the power to make or break,  
But they keep it smooth, no need to shake. [end of text]
