Alright, let's tackle this Magic: The Gathering scenario step by step. I'm going to break it down to understand the optimal plays for both Alice and Bob.

### Understanding the Cards and Situation

**Alice's Hand:**
- Two copies of 'Kindle'.
  - Kindle is an instant that deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards.

**Bob's Board:**
- Orim, Samite Healer (untapped).
  - Orim is a 1/3 legendary creature.
  - Ability: "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."

**Game State:**
- It's Alice's turn.
- Orim has been on the board for a while (no summoning sickness, so can tap immediately).
- Alice has sufficient mana to cast any spells.
- Bob's lands are tapped out (can't cast spells or activate abilities that require mana).

### Objective:
Alice wants to kill Orim with her two Kindles. Bob wants to prevent Orim from dying.

### Possible Plays:

**Alice's Options:**
1. Cast one Kindle, then the other Kindle.
2. Cast both Kindles in response to each other (stacking them).
3. Other sequences, but these seem the most relevant.

**Bob's Options:**
- Since Bob has no cards in hand and lands are tapped out, his only option is to use Orim's ability to prevent damage.
- Orim can tap to prevent the next 3 damage to any target this turn.

### Analyzing the Plays:

**Scenario 1: Alice casts one Kindle, then the other Kindle sequentially.**

1. Alice casts first Kindle.
   - At this point, no Kindles are in graveyards, so X = 2 + 0 = 2.
   - Kindle deals 2 damage to Orim.
   - Bob can respond by tapping Orim to prevent the next 3 damage.
     - Orim's ability prevents the next 3 damage to any target this turn.
     - So, the 2 damage from Kindle is prevented.
   - First Kindle resolves, but damage is prevented.
   - First Kindle goes to graveyard.

2. Alice casts second Kindle.
   - Now, there's 1 Kindle in graveyard, so X = 2 + 1 = 3.
   - Kindle deals 3 damage to Orim.
   - Orim is already tapped (from preventing the first Kindle's damage), so can't prevent this damage.
   - Orim takes 3 damage.
   - Orim's toughness is 3, so it dies.

**Outcome:** Orim dies.

**Scenario 2: Alice casts both Kindles in response to each other (stacking them).**

1. Alice casts first Kindle.
   - X = 2 (no Kindles in graveyard yet).
   - Before it resolves, Alice casts second Kindle in response.
     - Now, first Kindle is on the stack, second Kindle is being cast.
     - When second Kindle is cast, first Kindle is not yet in graveyard, so X = 2.
     - Second Kindle deals 2 damage to Orim.
     - Bob can tap Orim to prevent the next 3 damage.
       - Prevents the 2 damage from second Kindle.
     - Second Kindle resolves, damage prevented, goes to graveyard.
   
2. Now, first Kindle resolves.
   - There's now 1 Kindle in graveyard (the second one), so X = 2 + 1 = 3.
   - First Kindle deals 3 damage to Orim.
   - Orim is tapped (from preventing second Kindle's damage), can't prevent this.
   - Orim takes 3 damage and dies.

**Outcome:** Orim dies.

Wait a minute, in both scenarios, Orim dies. But is there a way for Bob to prevent Orim from dying?

Let me think if Bob can do better.

**Alternative Bob's Play:**

In Scenario 1:
- After first Kindle is cast, Bob taps Orim to prevent the next 3 damage.
- First Kindle's 2 damage is prevented.
- Then second Kindle is cast, deals 3 damage, Orim is tapped, can't prevent, dies.

In Scenario 2:
- First Kindle is cast, then second Kindle in response.
- Bob taps Orim to prevent second Kindle's 2 damage.
- Then first Kindle resolves with X=3, Orim is tapped, can't prevent, dies.

Is there a way for Bob to prevent both Kindles' damage?

No, because Orim can only prevent the next 3 damage once per turn (since tapping is part of the cost, and it can't untap during the turn unless there's an effect allowing it, which there isn't here).

So, in both scenarios, Orim dies.

But is one scenario better for Alice or Bob?

In both, Orim dies, but the order might matter for future turns, but since the question is about killing Orim now, both achieve that.

However, in Scenario 1, Alice casts Kindles sequentially, giving Bob a chance to respond to each. In Scenario 2, Alice stacks them, which might limit Bob's options, but in this case, it doesn't change the outcome.

But actually, in Scenario 2, if Alice stacks them, Bob can choose to prevent the first Kindle's damage instead of the second. Let me explore that.

**Re-examining Scenario 2 with Bob preventing first Kindle's damage:**

1. Alice casts first Kindle (X=2).
2. Alice casts second Kindle in response (X=2).
   - Now, stack is: second Kindle (top), first Kindle (bottom).
3. Bob can choose to tap Orim to prevent damage from either Kindle.
   - If Bob prevents second Kindle's damage:
     - Second Kindle's 2 damage is prevented, goes to graveyard.
     - Then first Kindle resolves with X=3 (since one Kindle in graveyard), deals 3 damage, Orim is tapped, can't prevent, dies.
   - If Bob prevents first Kindle's damage:
     - First Kindle's damage is prevented (but first Kindle hasn't resolved yet, so no Kindles in graveyard when second Kindle resolves).
     - Wait, no: when second Kindle resolves, first Kindle is still on stack, not in graveyard, so X=2.
     - Second Kindle deals 2 damage, Bob can prevent that (but already used Orim to prevent first Kindle's damage, so can't prevent second).
     - Wait, no: Orim's ability prevents the next 3 damage, so if Bob prevents first Kindle's damage (which is 2), then the next damage is second Kindle's 2, which is also prevented (since 3 - 2 = 1 left, but second Kindle is only 2, so fully prevented).
     - Then first Kindle resolves with X=3 (since second Kindle is in graveyard), deals 3 damage, but Orim's prevention has already been used up (prevented 2 from first Kindle, then 2 from second Kindle, total 4 prevented, but Orim only prevents up to 3, so this might not work as I'm thinking.

Hmm, maybe I'm confusing how the prevention works. Orim's ability prevents the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. So if Bob taps Orim in response to the first Kindle, it prevents the next 3 damage to Orim.

If the stack is:
- Second Kindle (top)
- First Kindle (bottom)

And Bob taps Orim in response to first Kindle (bottom), then the prevention applies to the next damage, which is second Kindle's 2 damage (prevented), then first Kindle's 3 damage (but prevention is used up after preventing 2, so 1 more can be prevented, but first Kindle is 3, so 2 is prevented, 1 gets through).

Wait, no: Orim prevents the next 3 damage total, not per spell. So if Bob prevents in response to first Kindle, then:
- Second Kindle's 2 damage is prevented (next 3 damage: 2 prevented, 1 left).
- First Kindle's 3 damage: 1 is prevented, 2 gets through.
Orim's toughness is 3, so takes 2 damage, survives.

So in this case, Orim survives with 1 damage marked.

But earlier, if Bob prevents in response to second Kindle, then:
- Second Kindle's 2 damage is prevented (next 3 damage: 2 prevented, 1 left).
- First Kindle's 3 damage: 1 is prevented, 2 gets through.
Same outcome.

Wait, no, in the first scenario where Alice casts sequentially:
1. First Kindle: X=2, Bob prevents, damage prevented, Kindle to graveyard.
2. Second Kindle: X=3, Orim is tapped, can't prevent, takes 3, dies.

In the stacked scenario where Bob prevents first Kindle's damage:
- Second Kindle: X=2, prevented (next 3 damage: 2 prevented, 1 left).
- First Kindle: X=3, 1 prevented, 2 damage, Orim survives with 1 damage.

So in the stacked scenario, if Bob prevents the first Kindle's damage, Orim survives.

But in the sequential scenario, Orim dies.

Therefore, Alice should cast Kindles sequentially to ensure Orim dies, because if she stacks them, Bob can choose to prevent in a way that Orim survives.

### Optimal Plays:

**Alice's Optimal Play:**
- Cast one Kindle, let it resolve (or give Bob a chance to respond), then cast the second Kindle.
  - This forces Bob to use Orim's prevention on the first Kindle, leaving Orim tapped and unable to prevent the second Kindle's larger damage.

**Bob's Optimal Play:**
- If Alice casts Kindles sequentially:
  - Tap Orim to prevent the first Kindle's damage.
  - Then Orim is tapped and can't prevent the second Kindle's damage, leading to Orim's death.
- If Alice stacks Kindles:
  - Tap Orim to prevent the first Kindle's damage (the one lower on the stack), which will prevent some damage from both Kindles, allowing Orim to survive.

But since Alice can choose the order, she should choose the sequential casting to ensure Orim dies.

### Final Outcome:
Alice should cast one Kindle, let Bob respond (likely tapping Orim to prevent that damage), then cast the second Kindle, which will deal lethal damage to Orim since it's tapped and can't prevent further damage.

**Step-by-Step:**
1. Alice casts first Kindle.
   - X = 2 (no Kindles in graveyard).
   - Kindle deals 2 damage to Orim.
2. Bob taps Orim to prevent the next 3 damage to Orim.
   - The 2 damage from first Kindle is prevented.
   - First Kindle goes to graveyard.
3. Alice casts second Kindle.
   - X = 2 + 1 = 3 (one Kindle in graveyard).
   - Kindle deals 3 damage to Orim.
   - Orim is tapped, can't prevent this damage.
   - Orim takes 3 damage, toughness is 3, so it dies.

### Conclusion:
The optimal play for Alice is to cast the Kindles one after the other, forcing Bob to use Orim's prevention on the first Kindle, leaving Orim vulnerable to the second Kindle's larger damage. Bob's best response is to prevent the first Kindle's damage, but this leads to Orim's death from the second Kindle. Therefore, Orim will die in this scenario. [end of text]
