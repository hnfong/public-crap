Alright, I need to figure out how to respond to this query. Let's break it down step by step.

The user wants me to perform a semantic grep on the given input based on a specific query. The query is about "names of countries or regions" and the output should list country/region names with line numbers, formatted like grep -n -o. Also, the response should be in a command line program format, with each line followed by a line break and a "---" separator.

First, let me understand the input structure. The input has multiple lines starting from line 1 to line 16 or so. Each line has a line number followed by a paragraph.

The query is: "names of countries or regions. only output the country/region names with line number, something like grep -n -o". So I need to find lines where the content is about country or region names, and output them with line number.

Additionally, the user mentioned that it's not about tangential lines but obviously matches. So I should ignore lines that don't have country/region names.

The output format is to output each line with line number followed by the line content, but only if it matches. And after each line output, emit a "---".

Also, the query is specifically about names of countries or regions, so I need to check each line for such content.

Looking at the input:

Line 1: "Let's Talk about Unfair Trade Restrictions" → Not country names.

Line 2: "In today's world, it's hard to understand why countries impose extra restrictions on importing goods from nations they consider 'unbalanced' in trade. This outdated practice hampers fair commerce..." → This has "unbalanced" which is a trade aspect but not country names.

Line 3: Empty line.

Line 4: "Take Britain, for example. They allow Silesia lawns to be imported for personal consumption..." → "Silesia" is a region, but not a country? Or is it? Maybe "Silesia" is a region. So perhaps it's a country region.

But the query is about country/region names. So line 4 has "Silesia" which is a region, so maybe it's a country region.

But let me check the query again: "names of countries or regions". So both country and region names are to be output.

So line 4: "Take Britain, for example. They allow Silesia lawns to be imported for personal consumption..." → "Silesia" is a region, so it's a country region. So line 4 is a match.

Line 5: Empty line.

Line 6: "Some argue that if Britain imports French goods..." → "France" is a country.

Line 7: "Another issue is that there's no reliable way..." → "France" again.

Line 8: "National biases..." → Maybe not.

Line 9: "Exchange rate..." → Not country names.

Line 10: "When the exchange rate..." → Not country names.

Line 11: "It's time for countries to rethink..." → "countries" is the term. So line 11 is a match.

Line 12: "It's time for countries to rethink..." → "countries" again.

Line 13: "It's time for countries to rethink..." → "countries" again.

Line 14: "It's time for countries to rethink..." → "countries" again.

Line 15: "Show original" → Not country names.

Line 16: "The value of trade..." → "England" and "Hamburg" are countries.

Line 17: "The value of trade..." → "England" and "Hamburg" are countries.

Line 18: "Another issue..." → Not country names.

Line 19: "Another issue..." → Not country names.

Line 20: "Another issue..." → Not country names.

Line 21: "Another issue..." → Not country names.
