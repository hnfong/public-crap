Alice is right. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure (at sea level). Bob's statement that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius is incorrect. However, Bob could still be "right" in a specific context, such as if he is referring to a different pressure or impurities affecting the freezing point. Without additional context, Alice's answer is the scientifically accurate one.
