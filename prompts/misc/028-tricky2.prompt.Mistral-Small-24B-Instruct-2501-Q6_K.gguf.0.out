 Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.
  Both Alice and Bob are partially correct, but they are talking about different contexts.

- **Alice is correct** in stating that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. This is the freezing point of pure water at sea level.

- **Bob is also correct** in a different context. If the water is not pure or if there are impurities or dissolved substances, the freezing point can be lower than 0 degrees Celsius. For example, seawater freezes at a lower temperature due to the presence of salt. However, at -10 degrees Celsius, water would definitely be frozen regardless of impurities.

So, in the context of pure water at standard atmospheric pressure, Alice is right. In the context of water with impurities or under different conditions, Bob's statement can be interpreted as correct. [end of text]
