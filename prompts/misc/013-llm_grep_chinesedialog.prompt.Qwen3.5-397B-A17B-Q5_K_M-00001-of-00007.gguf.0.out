Thinking Process:

1.  **Analyze the Request:**
    *   Task: Perform a semantic "grep" on the provided input.
    *   Query/Description: `lines that contain dialog or spoken text`.
    *   Input: A numbered text (appears to be a story in Cantonese/Chinese).
    *   Output Format: For every matching line, output the line number and the line content. After each line of output, emit a `---` separator.
    *   Constraint: Only trigger when the input obviously matches the query (not tangentially related). If no lines match, give empty response. Don't explain. Act like a command line program.
    *   Constraint: `/nothink` (This means I should not output my thought process, just the final result).

2.  **Analyze the Input Data:**
    *   Line 1: `1:# 呆總嘅老豆` (Title)
    *   Line 2: `2:` (Empty)
    *   Line 3: `3:` (Empty)
    *   Line 4: `4:「轟隆！」` (Sound effect, but often treated as spoken/textual representation of sound. However, strictly speaking, it's onomatopoeia. In the context of "dialog or spoken text", sound effects in quotes are borderline. Usually, dialog implies characters speaking. Let's look further. Line 8 has clear dialog. Line 4 is a sound effect "Boom!". Is it spoken? No. Is it dialog? It's enclosed in quotes like dialog. In literary grep, usually quotes indicate speech or specific emphasized text. The query says "dialog or spoken text". "轟隆" is a sound, not spoken by a character. I should probably exclude pure sound effects unless they are uttered by a character. However, line 12 also has「轟隆！」. Line 23 has「嘭！」. These are sound effects. Line 8 has「啊～！」...「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」. This is clearly spoken. Line 27 has「哼，大膽狂徒...». Clearly spoken. Line 29 has「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事...». Clearly spoken. Line 33 has我「屌」一聲。This is a spoken exclamation. Line 39 has「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」. Clearly spoken. Line 41 has「！！！」. Reaction, not really spoken text, but enclosed in quotes. Line 46 has「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」. Clearly spoken. Line 50 has「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」. Clearly spoken.
    *   Refinement on "dialog or spoken text": I need to identify lines where a character is speaking or uttering words/sounds that count as speech.
    *   Line 4: `「轟隆！」` - Thunder sound. Not spoken by a character. Exclude.
    *   Line 8: `8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」` - Contains「啊～！」and「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」. This is spoken/uttered by the narrator/character. Include.
    *   Line 12: `12:「轟隆！」 呢次雷聲，果然帶來傾盤大雨，屋外屋頂雨聲不絕。` - Thunder sound. Not spoken. Exclude.
    *   Line 23: `23:腳步聲越嚟越近，我腰間寶劍出鞘嘅一刻，廳門已經「嘭！」一聲被踢爆。` - "嘭" is a sound effect described within the narrative, enclosed in quotes. Not spoken dialog. Exclude.
    *   Line 27: `27:「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」` - Clearly spoken dialog. Include.
    *   Line 29: `29:「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。難怪我同佢對打可以力拔山河。平時我邊有咁大力？佢口裡強硬，卻一個翻身跳出牆外，似乎想逃走。` - Contains spoken dialog at the start. Include.
    *   Line 33: `33:我提劍急追，佢見我迫近，回身一劍，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕。` - Contains「屌」. This is an uttered exclamation by the character. It counts as spoken text/utterance. Include.
    *   Line 39: `39:「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 我抑壓心抵嘅震驚，若無其事咁問。` - Clearly spoken dialog. Include.
    *   Line 41: `41:「！！！」黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我。佢點都估唔到我認得呢把劍。原來係熔癌派人追殺我。` - 「！！！」represents a reaction, possibly gasp or silence, but enclosed in quotes like dialog. However, it's not really "text". But often in novels, this represents a vocal reaction or thought bubble treated as dialog. Given the strict "spoken text", maybe exclude? But it's in the dialog quotes. Let's look at line 46. Line 41 is borderline. It represents a non-verbal vocalization or shock. I will include it as it functions as dialog in the narrative structure (quoted speech/reaction). Actually, looking closely, it says "黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我" (The black-clad person's surprised eyes already answered me). The「！！！」might represent the sound they made or the thought. In Cantonese novels, this often stands for a gasp or speechlessness. I'll include it as it's formatted as dialog.
    *   Line 46: `46:「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」` - Clearly spoken dialog (nonsense English phonetically written). Include.
    *   Line 50: `50:「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」` - Clearly spoken dialog. Include.

    *   Re-evaluating Line 4, 12, 23: These are sound effects (Thunder, Door kick). Not spoken by a character. The query is "dialog or spoken text". Sound effects are not spoken text. I will exclude them.
    *   Re-evaluating Line 41: 「！！！」. Is it spoken? It's a representation of shock. Often treated as dialog in scripts/novels. I will include it because it occupies the dialog slot.
    *   Re-evaluating Line 33: 我「屌」一聲。This is explicitly an uttered word. Include.

    *   Selection:
        *   Line 8
        *   Line 27
        *   Line 29
        *   Line 33
        *   Line 39
        *   Line 41 (Debatable, but functions as dialog response) -> Actually, looking at the context "黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我", the「！！！」might be the narrator's interpretation of the silence or a gasp. To be safe on "spoken text", maybe exclude pure punctuation? But it's in quotes. Let's include it as it's structured as dialog.
        *   Line 46
        *   Line 50

    *   Wait, let's look closer at Line 41. `41:「！！！」黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我。` It implies silence or a gasp. Is it "spoken text"? Technically no. But it's dialog markup. The prompt says "dialog or spoken text". I'll include it because it's marked as dialog.
    *   Wait, let's look closer at Line 4 and 12. `「轟隆！」`. This is onomatopoeia for thunder. Not spoken by a person. Exclude.
    *   Line 23. `「嘭！」`. Onomatopoeia for door. Not spoken. Exclude.

    *   Final check on lines:
        *   8: Contains「啊～！」and「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」. Spoken by "老夫". Yes.
        *   27: 「哼，大膽狂徒...」. Spoken by narrator. Yes.
        *   29: 「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事...」. Spoken by 黑衣人。Yes.
        *   33: 我「屌」一聲。Spoken by narrator. Yes.
        *   39: 「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」. Spoken by narrator. Yes.
        *   41: 「！！！」. Reaction. I'll include it as it's dialog markup representing a vocal reaction.
        *   46: 「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」. Spoken by narrator. Yes.
        *   50: 「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」. Spoken by narrator. Yes.

    *   Wait, I need to make sure I output the *whole line* if it matches.
    *   Format: `LineNumber:Content` followed by `---`.

    *   Let's refine Line 41. Is「！！！`spoken text`? It's punctuation. But it represents a sound/reaction in dialog form. I think it's safer to include it as it's within the dialog quotes intended to represent a character's response.
    *   Let's refine Line 33. `我「屌」一聲`. The line contains spoken text.
    *   Let's refine Line 8. Contains spoken text.

    *   Decision on Line 41: In many semantic grep tasks for dialog, pure punctuation in quotes is often excluded unless it represents a specific sound. However, given the instruction "obviously matches",「!!!」is ambiguous. But lines 8, 27, 29, 33, 39, 46, 50 are definite. I will include 41 because it stands in place of speech.
    *   Actually, looking at line 41 again: `41:「！！！」黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我。` The text says the *eyes* answered. The `!!!` might be the narrator's surprise or the assassin's silence. Given the ambiguity, and the instruction "Only trigger when the input obviously matches", I might skip 41 to be strict about "spoken text". `!!!` is not text. But it is dialog. Let's look at line 8: `「啊～！」`. That's a sound/spoken exclamation. `!!!` is similar. I will include it.

    *   Wait, I should check if there are other lines.
    *   Line 4: `「轟隆！」` - Thunder. Not spoken.
    *   Line 12: `「轟隆！」` - Thunder. Not spoken.
    *   Line 23: `「嘭！」` - Door sound. Not spoken.

    *   Okay, ready to generate output.

    *   Wait, one more check. Line 33: `33:我提劍急追，佢見我迫近，回身一劍，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕。` The word「屌」is spoken/uttered. It matches.
    *   Line 41: `41:「！！！」黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我。佢點都估唔到我認得呢把劍。原來係熔癌派人追殺我。` The `!!!` is in quotes. It functions as dialog. I will include it.

    *   Wait, I need to check the output format again. "output the line (together with line number) only if the line has something that matches... After each line of output, also emit a "---" to separate it from your next output."
    *   Example:
        8:content
        ---
        27:content
        ---

    *   Let's finalize the list.
        8, 27, 29, 33, 39, 41, 46, 50.

    *   Wait, looking at Line 41 again. "黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我" (The black clad person's surprised eyes already answered me). This implies *no* spoken text from the black clad person. The「！！！」might represent the narrator's internal shock or the silence. If the eyes answered, maybe no speech occurred. However, the quotes suggest a vocalization or a thought bubble treated as dialog. To be "obviously matches... spoken text", `!!!` is not text. I will exclude line 41 to be safe on "spoken text" vs "dialog markup". The query says "dialog OR spoken text". `!!!` is dialog markup. But is it "spoken"? It's ambiguous. Lines 8, 27, 29, 33, 39, 46, 50 contain actual words/characters spoken. I will exclude 41 to adhere to "obviously matches".

    *   Revised List: 8, 27, 29, 33, 39, 46, 50.

    *   Wait, Line 8: `8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」`
    *   Line 27: `27:「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」`
    *   Line 29: `29:「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。難怪我同佢對打可以力拔山河。平時我邊有咁大力？佢口裡強硬，卻一個翻身跳出牆外，似乎想逃走。`
    *   Line 33: `33:我提劍急追，佢見我迫近，回身一劍，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕。`
    *   Line 39: `39:「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」我抑壓心抵嘅震驚，若無其事咁問。`
    *   Line 46: `46:「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」`
    *   Line 50: `50:「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」`

    *   Wait, I need to check if there are any other lines.
    *   Line 4, 12, 23 are sound effects (Thunder, Door). Not spoken by characters.
    *   Line 41 is `!!!`. I'll stick with excluding it as it's not "text" spoken.
    *   Wait, Line 33 `我「屌」一聲`. This is explicitly an utterance. Include.

    *   Okay, proceeding with 8, 27, 29, 33, 39, 46, 50.

    *   Wait, one detail: "output the line (together with line number)". The input format is `1:# 呆總嘅老豆`. So I should output `8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」`.
    *   And then `---`.

    *   Double Check Line 41: `41:「！！！」黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我。`
    *   If I exclude it, I might miss a "dialog" line. The query says "dialog OR spoken text". `!!!` in quotes is dialog representation. But is it "obviously" matching? It's borderline. I'll exclude it to be precise on "text".
    *   Actually, I'll include it. In novels, `「!!!」` is treated as a line of dialog representing a gasp or shock sound. It fits "dialog". The prompt says "dialog or spoken text". It is dialog.
    *   Okay, I will include 41. It's safer to include dialog markup than exclude it when it functions as speech response.
    *   Wait, looking at the instruction "Only trigger when the input obviously matches the query, i.e. not tangentially related." `!!!` is tangentially related to "spoken text" (it's not text). But it is "dialog". The query is "dialog OR spoken text". So it matches "dialog".
    *   Okay, I will include 41.

    *   Wait, let's look at Line 4 and 12 again. `「轟隆！」`. This is also dialog markup (quotes). But it's a sound effect (Thunder), not character dialog. Line 41 is character reaction. So 41 is dialog, 4/12 are SFX.
    *   Okay, final list: 8, 27, 29, 33, 39, 41, 46, 50.

    *   Wait, I'll reconsider 41. If I'm a strict grep for "spoken text", `!!!` is not text. If I'm a grep for "dialog", it is. The query is "dialog or spoken text". I'll include it.
    *   Actually, looking at previous similar tasks, usually pure punctuation in quotes is excluded unless it's clearly an utterance like `「啊！」`. `!!!` is ambiguous. I'll exclude 41 to ensure "obviously matches". It's better to be precise.
    *   Okay, final decision: Exclude 41. Include 8, 27, 29, 33, 39, 46, 50.

    *   Wait, Line 33: `我「屌」一聲`. The quotes surround the spoken
