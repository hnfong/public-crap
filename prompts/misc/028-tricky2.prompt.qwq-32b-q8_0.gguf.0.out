Okay, let's see. The question is about whether Bob or Alice is right regarding the freezing point of water at -10 degrees Celsius. Alice says water freezes at 0°C, which I know is the standard freezing point. But Bob argues that he's still right even though he mentioned -10°C. Hmm, maybe there's something I'm missing here.

First, I should recall that the freezing point of water under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere) is indeed 0°C. That's when liquid water turns to ice. So Alice is correct on that point. But Bob says he's right too. How could that be?

Wait, maybe Bob is considering different conditions. Like, if the water is supercooled? Supercooled water can remain liquid below 0°C, but that's not the same as freezing at -10. Or perhaps impurities or pressure changes? For example, saltwater has a lower freezing point, but pure water should still freeze at 0. Alternatively, maybe Bob is talking about something else, like the temperature staying at -10 once it's frozen? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe Bob is thinking of the Celsius scale in reverse? No, that's not it. Or perhaps he's referring to the fact that once water is frozen, it stays solid below 0, so at -10 it's already ice. But the act of freezing happens at 0. So when Alice says "freezes at 0," that's correct. Bob's statement that it freezes at -10 is wrong, but he claims he's still right. Maybe he's using a different context, like the temperature of the environment? Like if you put water in a freezer set to -10, it would freeze, but the actual freezing point is still 0. The temperature has to reach 0 for freezing to start, then it can go lower. So maybe Bob is confused, but there's a way he's technically correct in another sense?

Wait, maybe the question is a trick. If the temperature is -10, then the water is already frozen, so it's in the solid state. So Bob could be saying that at -10, water is frozen, which is true, but the process of freezing occurs at 0. So Alice is correct about the freezing point, but Bob is correct that at -10, it's ice. The wording matters. The question is "what happens to water at -10°C?" So if the water is already at that temperature, it would be ice. But the freezing process happens when it reaches 0. So maybe both have valid points depending on interpretation. But the original statements: Bob says "water freezes at -10", which is incorrect because the freezing point is 0. Alice corrects that. Bob then says he's still right. So perhaps the key is that once it's below 0, it's frozen, so at -10 it's frozen, hence "freezes at -10" is a misstatement, but the result is correct. But the process of freezing occurs at 0. So technically, Bob is wrong about the freezing point, but right that at -10 it's ice. The question is who is right in their statements. The user's question is "Who is right? Explain briefly." So the answer is Alice is correct about the freezing point being 0°C. Bob's statement is incorrect because the freezing occurs at 0, not -10. However, if the context is that at -10°C, the water is already frozen, then Bob might be partially correct in that scenario, but his original statement is wrong. The key point is the freezing point is 0, so Alice is right. Bob's assertion that he's still right might be a play on words, but scientifically, Alice is correct.

Alice is correct. Water freezes at **0°C** under standard conditions. At -10°C, water is already in its solid state (ice). Bob’s claim that water "freezes at -10°C" is incorrect because freezing occurs at 0°C. However, he might argue that water *remains* frozen at -10°C, which is true, but the **process of freezing** (the phase change from liquid to solid) happens at 0°C. Thus, Alice is right about the freezing point, while Bob’s statement conflates the freezing temperature with the temperature of already frozen water. [end of text]
