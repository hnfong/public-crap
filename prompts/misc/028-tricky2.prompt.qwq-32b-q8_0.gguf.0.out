Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Okay, so Alice and Bob are arguing about the freezing point of water. Let me think through this step by step. 

First, Alice says that water freezes at 0°C, which I know is the standard freezing point. But Bob claims it freezes at -10°C. Then Alice corrects him, and Bob says he's still right. Hmm, why would Bob think that?

Wait, maybe there's something about supercooling or different conditions. Normally, pure water freezes at 0°C, but if it's supercooled, it can remain liquid below 0 until a nucleation point is reached. But does that mean it freezes at a lower temperature? Or maybe Bob is referring to impurities? Like salt water has a lower freezing point. But the question is about regular water, right?

Alternatively, maybe Bob is considering the concept of the triple point or some other phase change? Or perhaps he's thinking of the eutectic point in some mixture? But the question specifically mentions water, so that's probably not it.

Wait, another angle: maybe the context is about ice forming at -10°C. Like, once water is already frozen, it stays solid below 0. But the actual freezing process happens at 0. So Bob might be confused between the temperature at which it starts to freeze versus the temperature at which it remains frozen. 

Alternatively, maybe Bob is talking about the temperature of the environment. If the surroundings are at -10°C, then water would freeze because it's below 0. So in that case, when the environment is -10, the water would have already frozen. But the freezing point is still 0. So Bob's statement is technically incorrect because the freezing occurs at 0, but the water would be solid at -10. 

Ah, so maybe Bob is right in the sense that at -10°C, water is ice, so it has already frozen. But the process of freezing happens at 0. So Alice is correct about the freezing point, but Bob is correct that at -10°C, water is in the solid state. Therefore, both have a point, but the question is about what happens to water at -10°C. So the answer would be that water is already frozen by then, so Bob is right in that it's ice at that temperature, even though the actual freezing occurs at 0. 

Wait, but the exact wording: Alice asks "What happens to water at -10°C?" Bob says "Water freezes at -10°C." Alice corrects the freezing point. Bob says he's still right. So the key is whether "freezes at" refers to the temperature at which the phase change occurs (0°C) or the temperature at which it is in the frozen state (-10°C). Since freezing is the process that happens at 0°C, Bob is wrong about the freezing occurring at -10. However, if the question is about the state of water at -10, then it's ice. But the way Bob phrased it is about the freezing happening at that temperature, which is incorrect. So Alice is right about the freezing point, but Bob might be right that water is solid at -10. But the question is specifically about what happens when it's at -10. So maybe the answer is that Bob is correct in that water is frozen at -10, but the process of freezing occurs at 0. Therefore, depending on interpretation, but the standard answer would be Alice is correct about the freezing point, but Bob's statement is technically wrong because freezing happens at 0. However, if the question is about the state, then Bob is right. But the way the question is phrased, "what happens to water at -10°C?" the answer would be that it's already frozen, so Bob is correct in that it's ice there, but the process of freezing is at 0. So maybe both have a point, but the key is the exact wording. Since Bob said "freezes at -10", that's wrong. So Alice is right. But Bob might argue that at -10 it's frozen, so he's right in a different sense. The problem says "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" So the answer is that it's ice, so Bob is correct in that it's frozen there, but the process of freezing occurs at 0. So maybe the answer is that both are correct in different aspects, but the question is about the event of freezing happening at that temperature, so Alice is right. Alternatively, the question is about the state, so Bob is right. Hmm, need to clarify.

Wait, the exact exchange: Alice asks what happens at -10. Bob says water freezes at that temp. Alice says no, it freezes at 0. Bob says he's still right. The key is that Bob's statement is that the freezing occurs at -10, which is wrong. But maybe he's referring to the fact that if the temperature is lowered to -10, the water would have already frozen, so the process of freezing would have happened as it cooled through 0 to -10. So the freezing occurs at 0, but the water is at -10, so it's already frozen. Therefore, Bob is incorrect in stating that the freezing happens at -10, but correct that at -10 it's ice. Since the question is "what happens to water at -10°C?" the answer is that it's ice, so Bob is right in that sense. But the way he phrased it as "freezes at -10" is wrong. So maybe the answer is that Alice is correct about the freezing point, but Bob is correct that at -10°C, water is in the solid state. However, the question is about what happens when it's at that temperature. Since the freezing is the process that occurs at 0, the answer would be Alice is right. But perhaps the question is a trick, considering that under certain conditions like supercooled water might not freeze until it's disturbed, but at -10 it would have frozen. Alternatively, maybe Bob is thinking of the melting point, but that's the same as freezing. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is a play on words. If the water is already at -10, then it's ice. So the answer is that Bob is correct in that at -10°C, water is ice, so it has frozen. But the process of freezing happens at 0. So depending on interpretation, but the key is the exact wording. Since Bob said "freezes at -10", that's incorrect. The correct answer is Alice is right about the freezing point. But Bob might argue that the water is frozen at that temperature, so he's right in that it's in the frozen state. The question is ambiguous, but in standard terms, the freezing point is 0, so Alice is correct. Therefore, Bob is wrong. But maybe there's another angle. Wait, maybe the question is about the temperature of the water itself. If the water is at -10°C, then it's supercooled liquid, but that's unstable. So in reality, pure water can't stay liquid below 0 without nucleation. So at -10, it would have already frozen. So in that case, the water at -10 is ice, so Bob is correct that it's frozen there, but the process of freezing occurs at 0. So the answer is that both have a point, but the question is about what happens at -10. Since the water is solid there, Bob is correct in that it's ice, but the process of freezing is at 0. So the answer is that Bob is right because at -10°C, water is in the solid state (frozen), even though the freezing process occurs at 0°C. Therefore, the answer is Bob is correct in that context.

Bob is correct in the sense that water exists as ice at -10°C, but Alice is correct about the freezing point. Here's the breakdown:

- **Alice's point**: The **freezing point** of pure water is **0°C**. This is the temperature at which liquid water transitions to ice under standard conditions. Bob is incorrect if he claims the freezing process itself occurs at -10°C.

- **Bob's point**: At **-10°C**, water is already in its solid state (ice). Once water freezes at 0°C, it remains solid as the temperature drops further. Thus, Bob is correct that water is frozen at -10°C, even though the freezing process happened earlier.

**Conclusion**: Alice is right about the freezing point (0°C), but Bob is also correct that water is solid at -10°C. The ambiguity in the question ("what happens to water at -10°C?") allows both answers, but strictly speaking, Bob’s statement ("freezes at -10°C") is incorrect because freezing occurs at 0°C. However, if interpreted as the state of water at that temperature, Bob is correct. The key distinction is between the **process** (freezing at 0°C) and the **resulting state** (solid at -10°C).
