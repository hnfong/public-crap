Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided Japanese song lyrics with a lighthearted, mischievous melody and wants a story interpretation that's literal in a fantastical setting, not just metaphorical.

First, I need to understand the lyrics. Let me read through them again. The key points are:

- "ドングリを辿っても着きません" (Following acorns doesn't get you there)
- "森の小さなレストラン" (Forest's small restaurant)
- "空っぽのポケットを弄って" (Fiddling with empty pockets)
- "忘れた人から辿り着く" (Arriving from someone who forgot)
- "予約は一つもありません" (No reservations)
- "空席だらけのランチ時" (Lunchtime with empty seats)
- "小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる" (Birds fluttering and laughing)
- "真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根" (Red-painted tin roof)
- "メニューはおすすめ そればかり" (Menu is just recommendations)
- "バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ" (Violin, flute, cello, viola)
- "ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい" (Welcome welcome)
- "たらふく食べたらお眠りよ" (Eat until full, then sleep)
- "明日は明日で エトセトラ" (Tomorrow is tomorrow, etc.)
- "右から左へおおわらわ" (Right to left, all over)
- "手乗りの子熊も踊り出す" (Hand-sized cub starts dancing)
- "カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル" (Carpaccio, paella, appetizers)
- "リゾット デザートはありません" (Risotto, no dessert)
- "お墓の中まで届けましょう" (We'll deliver to the inside of the grave)
- "今宵は最後のフルコース" (Tonight is the last full course)

Hmm, the song seems to be about a mysterious forest restaurant that's empty, with a menu that's odd (no dessert, but "last full course" and delivering to graves). The mention of "お墓の中まで届けましょう" (deliver to the inside of the grave) is a bit unsettling. But the melody is lighthearted and mischievous, so maybe it's a playful take on a ghostly or magical place.

The user wants a literal fantastical interpretation, not metaphorical. So, maybe it's a real place in a fantasy world. Let's think: "森の小さなレストラン" (forest's small restaurant) – maybe a restaurant run by forest spirits or animals. The "忘れた人" (someone who forgot) might refer to people who get lost in the forest and stumble upon it.

The empty seats and birds laughing could mean it's a place that only appears to those who are lost or forgotten. The menu items like carpaccio, paella, etc., are normal, but "no dessert" and "last full course" might hint that it's a one-time meal for the dead. Wait, "お墓の中まで届けましょう" – delivering to the grave. So maybe the restaurant serves the dead, and the "last full course" is their final meal before moving on.

But the melody is lighthearted, so maybe it's not scary. Maybe it's a place where the dead come to eat, but it's friendly. The "手乗りの子熊" (hand-sized cub) dancing adds a playful element. The "バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ" (violin, flute, cello, viola) suggests music from the kitchen, maybe the chefs are playing instruments.

Wait, "予約は一つもありません" – no reservations, so it's a walk-in place. But "空席だらけ" (empty seats) – so it's not busy. Maybe it's a restaurant that only serves those who are supposed to be there, like the dead. But the "忘れた人" (someone who forgot) – maybe people who forgot their way, or forgot their own death? Or maybe it's a place that appears to those who are about to die, and the meal is their last.

But the user says it's not metaphorical. So literal: the restaurant is in a forest, run by some magical beings. The "small restaurant" is a real place. The "empty pockets" might mean the customers have no money, but the restaurant doesn't care. The "no reservations" but it's empty, so maybe it's a place that only opens for certain people.

Wait, "お墓の中まで届けましょう" – "we'll deliver to the inside of the grave." So maybe the restaurant is delivering food to graves, which is a bit odd. But in a fantastical setting, maybe it's a place where the dead eat, and the food is delivered to their graves. So the "last full course" is the final meal before they rest.

But the song says "今宵は最後のフルコース" (tonight is the last full course), so maybe it's a one-time event. The "明日は明日で エトセトラ" (tomorrow is tomorrow, etc.) suggests that the restaurant is temporary, only open for this night.

The "手乗りの子熊" (hand-sized cub) dancing – maybe the restaurant has animal staff. The "小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる" (birds fluttering and laughing) could be the birds as part of the setting.

Putting it all together: The forest restaurant is a magical place that appears to those who are lost or have forgotten their way (maybe the dead or those about to die). It's empty because it's only for the deceased, but the staff (birds, animals) are cheerful. The menu is limited, but they serve a final meal before the guests move on. The "last full course" is their final meal, and the restaurant is a temporary place that only exists for that night.

Wait, but the melody is lighthearted, so maybe it's not a sad place. Maybe it's a friendly place where the dead come to have a meal before moving on, and it's a celebration. The "mischievous" part could be the animals and birds playing around.

Another angle: The restaurant is run by forest spirits. The "empty pockets" mean the customers don't have money, but the spirits don't care. The "no reservations" because it's a magical place that only opens when needed. The "last full course" is a one-time feast for those who have passed, and the delivery to the grave is part of the ritual.

Wait, "お墓の中まで届けましょう" – "we'll deliver to the inside of the grave." So maybe the food is delivered to the grave, meaning the dead eat it there. So the restaurant is a place where the dead can have a meal, and the staff (animals) deliver it to their graves. But the restaurant itself is in the forest, so maybe the customers are the dead, and the restaurant is a meeting place.

But the song says "森の小さなレストラン" (forest's small restaurant), so it's a physical place. The "空席だらけ" (empty seats) because it's only for the dead, and they're not many. The "小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる" – birds laughing, maybe they're the staff.

The "バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ" from the kitchen – maybe the chefs are playing music while cooking.

"ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい" – welcome, so the restaurant is welcoming the dead.

"たらふく食べたらお眠りよ" – eat until full, then sleep. So after eating, they rest (die).

"明日は明日で エトセトラ" – tomorrow is tomorrow, so the restaurant is temporary, only open for this night.

"右から左へおおわらわ" – all over the place, maybe the staff is busy.

"手乗りの子熊も踊り出す" – the cub starts dancing, adding to the playful vibe.

So the literal story: In a magical forest, there's a small restaurant that only appears to those who have forgotten their way (the dead or those about to die). It's run by forest spirits and animals (birds, bears), who serve a final meal (the last full course) to the guests. The restaurant is empty because it's only for the deceased, but the staff is cheerful and mischievous. After eating, the guests rest (die), and the restaurant disappears, only to reappear for the next night.

But the user said "not just metaphorical," so this should be a literal story in a fantasy world. So the restaurant is real, the dead come there, the animals are real, etc.

Another point: "ドングリを辿っても着きません" – following acorns doesn't get you there. So the path is tricky, only those who are meant to find it can. "忘れた人から辿り着く" – arriving from someone who forgot. Maybe the person who forgot their way (the dead) leads others there.

Wait, "忘れた人から辿り着く" – "arriving from someone who forgot." So the person who forgot (the dead) is the one who leads you to the restaurant. So the restaurant is found by those who are lost, which are the dead.

Putting it all together: The forest restaurant is a place that only appears to the dead or those who have forgotten their way in life (i.e., the dead). It's run by forest spirits and animals, serving a final meal before they rest. The empty seats mean it's only for the dead, and the staff is playful. The "last full course" is their final meal, and after eating, they sleep (die). The melody is lighthearted because it's a friendly place, not scary.

I think that's the literal interpretation. The key is that it's a real place in a fantasy setting, not metaphorical. So the story is about a magical restaurant in the forest that serves the dead, with a cheerful staff, and it's a temporary place that only exists for the night.

The lyrics describe a **temporary, magical restaurant in a forest that only appears to those who have "forgotten" their way—i.e., the recently departed or lost souls**. It is not metaphorical but a literal fantastical setting: the restaurant exists as a whimsical, transient space for the dead to enjoy a final meal before moving on. Here’s the story:

---

**The Forest’s Last Feast**  
Deep in the woods, a tiny restaurant with a red-painted tin roof materializes for those who wander lost—specifically, spirits who’ve forgotten their path to the afterlife. The place has no reservations, no customers (empty seats), and no need for money (empty pockets), because it only serves those who *belong* there. Birds flutter and laugh at the door, and a hand-sized bear cub dances with the staff, while the kitchen hums with violin, flute, and cello.  

The menu is simple: carpaccio, paella, and appetizers, but **no dessert**—because the meal is *final*. The staff (a mix of forest spirits and animals) greet guests with cheerful "welcome"s, urging them to eat until full before resting. "Tomorrow is tomorrow," they say, as if the restaurant’s existence is fleeting. The "last full course" is served tonight, and after eating, guests are gently guided to their graves—"we’ll deliver to the inside of the grave," the staff sing, not as a grim promise, but as a playful, natural transition.  

The melody’s mischievous lilt comes from the restaurant’s *lightheartedness*: it’s not a place of sorrow, but a cozy, temporary haven where the dead enjoy a final, joyful meal before their rest. The "empty seats" aren’t a sign of neglect—they’re a sign the place is *only for those who’ve arrived*. The acorns (ドングリ) that lead nowhere? A clue that the path is hidden until you’re meant to find it.  

**Literal twist**: The restaurant isn’t haunted—it’s *run by the forest itself*, a living, whimsical entity that hosts the dead with kindness, not fear. The "forgetful" guests are those who’ve slipped through the veil of life, and the staff (birds, bears, and musicians) are its gentle caretakers.  

*Why it’s not metaphorical*: The song treats the restaurant as a real, physical place in a world where death is a quiet, communal event—like a picnic in the woods, but for the departed. The "grave delivery" is literal: the food is served *to* the grave, not *from* it, as part of the ritual. The mischievous tone? Because the forest’s spirits are having fun with their duty.
