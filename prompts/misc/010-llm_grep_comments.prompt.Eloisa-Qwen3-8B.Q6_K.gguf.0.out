Okay, the user wants me to act as a semantic grep tool. They provided a script and asked to output lines that contain comments. Comments in scripts are usually lines starting with a hash symbol (#). 

First, I need to go through each line of the input. Let me check line by line. Line 1 is a shebang, not a comment. Line 2 is a shell option, not a comment. Line 3 is empty. Line 4 starts with #, so that's a comment. I should include that. Line 5 is a command, not a comment. Line 6 is another command. Line 7 is empty. Line 8 is a function definition, not a comment. Line 9 is a shell option inside the function. Line 10 is a command. Line 11 is a variable assignment. Line 12 is a command. Line 13 is empty. Line 14 starts with #, so that's a comment. Line 15 starts with #, another comment. Line 16 is a variable assignment. Line 17 is a command. Line 18 is a command. Line 19 is empty. Line 20 starts with #, comment. Line 21 is a command. Line 22 is a command. Line 23 is a command. Line 24 is a command. Line 25 is a command. Line 26 is a command. Line 27 is a command. Line 28 is empty. Line 29 starts with #, comment. Line 30 is a command. Line 31 is a command. Line 32 is a command. Line 33 is a command. Line 34 is a command. Line 35 is a command. Line 36 is a command. Line 37 is empty. Line 38 starts with #, comment. Line 39 is a command. Line 40 is a command. Line 41 is a command. Line 42 is a command. Line 43 is a command. Line 44 is a command. Line 45 is a command. Line 46 is empty. Line 47 starts with #, comment. Line 48 is a command. Line 49 is a command. Line 50 is a command. Line 51 is a command. Line 52 is a command. Line 53 is a command. Line 54 is a command. Line 55 is a command. Line 56 is a command. Line 57 is a command. Line 58 is a command. Line 59 is a command. Line 60 is a command. Line 61 is a command. Line 62 is a command. Line 63 is a command. Line 64 is a command. Line 65 is a command.

So the lines with comments are 4, 14, 15, 20, 29, 38, 47. I need to output these lines with their line numbers and separate each with ---.
