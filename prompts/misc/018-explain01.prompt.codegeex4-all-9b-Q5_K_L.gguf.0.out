Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

The Federal Reserve is like the bank of banks. It's like the big boss of all the banks in the country. It sets the rules for how much money banks can make, and it controls the interest rates. It's like the teacher who makes sure everyone follows the rules. When the Federal Reserve raises the interest rates, it's like the teacher giving everyone a detention. When it lowers the interest rates, it's like the teacher letting everyone go early. The Federal Reserve also watches out for the economy, like a parent watching out for their kids. It tries to make sure the economy is doing well, and it tries to prevent things like bubbles and crashes. So, the Federal Reserve is like the big boss of the banks, the teacher who sets the rules, and the parent who watches out for the economy.
