Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

Yo, yo, check it out, I'm gonna break it down for you
The Fed's like the bouncer at the club, they make sure it's cool
They keep an eye on the money, y'know, that paper green
They make sure it's flowing, no one's being mean

They set interest rates, like how much your loan cost
They decide when to cut it or make it more, it's all about that cost
If the economy's low, they pump up the cash flow
If it's too high, they gotta slow it down, yo!

They're like the DJ at the party, they know when to drop the bass
They keep the economy moving, it ain't no joke
They got tools in their bag, they know just what to do
If there's a financial crisis, they step in like a bro

So, the next time you hear about the Fed, don't get all scared
Remember, they're just doing their job, keeping the money fair
They're like the backbone of the economy, always in control
So, let's keep it rolling, no need to y'all, let the Fed handle that role!<|im_end|>
