Alice is correct. Water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10 degrees Celsius, water should be in a solid state, assuming it's not in a supercooled state or under unusual conditions. Bob's statement is incorrect because he's stating a general rule incorrectly. Water doesn't freeze at -10 degrees Celsius; it's already frozen by that point under normal circumstances.
