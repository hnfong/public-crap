Explain the role of China's National People Congress to a 5 year old child who lives in London.

Imagine that there's a big family in China, and this family has a lot of rules to follow. The National People's Congress is like the group of grown-ups in the family who decide what those rules are going to be. They meet and talk about what's best for everyone in China and make decisions about things like schools, parks, and hospitals. Just like your parents and teachers help make rules for you at home and in school, the National People's Congress helps make rules for the whole country of China.
