**Yo, listen up fam - let me break down the Fed for you:**

*Federal Reserve, that's the bank of banks, you feel me?*  
*They the ones controlling the money game, keeping it real, G*

**[Verse 1]**  
They printing money like mixtapes, but they gotta be smart  
Can't flood the streets with bills, or inflation gon' start  
Like when everyone dropping fire tracks, the market get saturated  
Price of everything jump up, and your paper don't stretch like it used to, you dig?

They set the interest rates, that's like the cost to borrow  
Make it cheap, businesses thrive, tomorrow lookin' proper  
Make it high, slow it down when things getting too crazy  
Like a DJ reading the crowd, know when to play it lazy

**[Chorus]**  
*Fed watching over the economy, keeping it stable*  
*Like a DJ managing the club, prevent it from going crazy, you able?*

**[Verse 2]**  
When the economy crashing, they step in like cleanup crew  
Lower rates, buy bonds, doing what they gotta do  
Like when your homie's career struggling, you give 'em a boost  
Help the banks, help the people, keep the whole system loose

They got banks' backs like labels got artists' backs  
Make sure money keep flowing, no financial attacks  
Control the supply of cash, keep the wheel spinning right  
Without them, the whole economy might lose the fight

**[Outro]**  
*So that's the Fed, the money maestro, running the show*  
*Keeping the dollar strong, making sure the system flow* [end of text]
