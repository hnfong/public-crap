A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. At temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius, water turns into ice.

B) If a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will not freeze. Instead, it will remain in its liquid state. However, the water might become colder and potentially cause the glass to contract slightly due to the decrease in temperature. If the glass is made of a material that can withstand low temperatures, it may not show any visible signs of contraction. But, it's essential to note that the water's properties, such as its density and viscosity, may change slightly at this temperature.

Keep in mind that the freezing point of water can vary slightly depending on the presence of impurities or dissolved substances. Pure water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. But, if the water contains impurities or dissolved substances, the freezing point can be lower or higher than 0 degrees Celsius.

It's also worth mentioning that the freezing point of water can be affected by external factors like pressure and the presence of other substances. For example, water can freeze at temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius under high pressure or in the presence of certain chemicals. However, these conditions are not typically encountered in everyday situations.

In summary, pure water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius, but it will remain in its liquid state if cooled down to this temperature. The glass may contract slightly due to the decrease in temperature, but the water's properties will not change significantly. The freezing point of water can vary depending on the presence of impurities or dissolved substances, and external factors like pressure and the presence of other substances can also affect the freezing point.
