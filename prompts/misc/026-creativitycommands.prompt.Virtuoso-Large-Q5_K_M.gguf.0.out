The command you've provided is a pipeline of several operations that process the text in `wowfanfic.txt`. Let's break down each part of the command and then discuss the probable output:

1. **`cat wowfanfic.txt`**: This command reads the contents of `wowfanfic.txt` and outputs it to the standard output (stdout).

2. **`| perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'`**: This part of the pipeline takes the output from `cat` and processes it using a Perl one-liner. The Perl script:
   - Splits the input into words based on whitespace (`\s`), storing the words in the array `@a`.
   - Iterates over each word in `@a` and prints each word followed by a newline.

3. **`| sort`**: This command sorts the words alphabetically.

4. **`| uniq -c`**: This command counts the occurrences of each unique word, prefixing each word with its count.

5. **`| sort -n`**: This command sorts the output numerically based on the count, so the words with the lowest counts come first.

6. **`| tail -n 20`**: This command outputs the last 20 lines of the sorted list, which will be the 20 words with the highest counts.

### Probable Output

Given the nature of the text (a fan fiction based on World of Warcraft characters), the output will likely show the 20 most frequently used words in the text. Here's what you can expect:

1. **Common Function Words**: These are words that have a grammatical function but little lexical meaning, such as articles, prepositions, and conjunctions. Examples include "the", "and", "of", "to", "in", "a", "an", "is", "are", "was", "were", "for", "with", "on", "at", "by", "from", "but", "or", "not", "that", "this", "these", "those", "it", "its", "they", "their", "them", "he", "she", "his", "her", "him", "hers", "we", "our", "us", "you", "your", "yours", "I", "me", "my", "mine".

2. **Common Content Words**: These are words that carry the main content of the text, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. In a World of Warcraft fan fiction, you might see words like "Azeroth", "Orgrimmar", "Stormwind", "Alliance", "Horde", "warrior", "mage", "priest", "dungeon", "quest", "raid", "dragon", "orc", "elf", "human", "dwarf", "night", "elf", "goblin", "troll", "shaman", "paladin", "druid", "hunter", "rogue", "death", "knight", "monk", "demon", "angel", "light", "darkness", "magic", "spell", "weapon", "armor", "gold", "coin", "item", "loot", "boss", "player", "character", "class", "race", "guild", "faction", "PvP", "PvE".

### Example Output

Here is a hypothetical example of the output:

```
  123 the
  115 and
  108 of
   97 to
   90 in
   85 a
   80 is
   75 that
   70 it
   65 with
   60 on
   55 for
   50 was
   45 as
   40 at
   35 by
   30 from
   25 but
   20 or
   15 Azeroth
```

### Explanation

- **Common Function Words**: Words like "the", "and", "of", "to", "in", "a", "is", "that", "it", "with", "on", "for", "was", "as", "at", "by", "from", "but", "or" are likely to be among the most frequent because they are essential for constructing sentences and are used in a wide variety of contexts.
- **Common Content Words**: Words like "Azeroth" might appear frequently if the setting of Azeroth is central to the story. Other content words like "warrior", "mage", "quest", "raid", etc., might also appear frequently depending on the specific themes and actions described in the fan fiction.

This output reflects the basic linguistic principle that in any natural language text, certain function words are used more frequently than content words, and the most frequent content words are likely to be those that are central to the topic or setting of the text. [end of text]
