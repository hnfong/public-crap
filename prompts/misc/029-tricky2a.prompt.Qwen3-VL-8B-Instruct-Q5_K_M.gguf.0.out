Bob is right — but only if he’s being playful or sarcastic. Literally, water freezes at 0°C under standard atmospheric pressure, so Alice is correct on the scientific fact. Bob’s statement “I’m still right” is a joke — he’s implying that even though water doesn’t freeze at -10°C *in the sense that it’s already frozen*, he’s “right” because he’s being clever or cheeky. In reality, at -10°C, water *is* frozen — it’s solid ice. So Bob’s statement is technically true *if* you interpret it as “water at -10°C is frozen,” which is correct. Alice’s correction is about the *freezing point*, not the state at a colder temperature.

✅ So:  
- **Alice is right** about the freezing point (0°C).  
- **Bob is right** about the state of water at -10°C (it’s frozen).  
- Bob’s “I’m still right” is a humorous twist — he’s not contradicting science, he’s just being cheeky.

**Final answer: Both are right — depending on context. Bob’s “I’m still right” is a joke.** [end of text]
