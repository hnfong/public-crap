Okay, let's see. So the question is about whether Bob is right when he says "It freezes" in response to Alice asking what happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius. Alice corrects him by saying water freezes at 0 degrees, so Bob says yes, but he's still right.

Hmm, first, I need to recall the basic fact about water freezing. Water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. So at 0°C, it's the freezing point. But the question is about -10°C. So if the temperature is below 0°C, like -10°C, then water should already be frozen, right? Because once it's below the freezing point, it's in solid form.

Wait, so Alice says water freezes at 0°C, which is correct. But Bob says "It freezes" when asked about -10°C. So Bob's statement is a bit ambiguous. If someone asks what happens to water at -10°C, the answer isn't that it freezes (since freezing is the process that happens at 0°C), but rather that it's already frozen. So Bob's answer is technically incorrect because the freezing process occurs at 0°C, not at -10°C. But Bob says, "Yes, but I'm still right." So why would he think he's right?

Wait, maybe Bob is interpreting the question as "What happens to water at -10°C?" and he's saying it freezes, meaning that at that temperature, the water is in a frozen state. But the freezing point is 0°C, so below that, it's frozen. So if the question is "what happens to water at -10°C," the correct answer is that it's frozen, not that it freezes. The word "freezes" refers to the process of turning from liquid to solid, which happens at 0°C. So at -10°C, the water is already frozen, so the process of freezing has already occurred.

But Bob says "It freezes," which is the process, not the state. So Alice is correct that water freezes at 0°C, but Bob's answer is wrong because at -10°C, the water isn't freezing; it's already frozen. However, Bob claims he's still right. Wait, maybe he's being tricky. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe Bob is saying that at -10°C, the water freezes, meaning that if you have liquid water at 0°C and then cool it to -10°C, it freezes. But the question is "What happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius?" So the temperature is -10°C. If the water is at -10°C, then it's already frozen. So the correct answer is "It is frozen," not "It freezes." So Bob's answer is incorrect because he used the verb "freezes" instead of "is frozen."

But Bob says, "Yes, but I'm still right." So why would he think that? Maybe he's conflating the temperature with the process. Like, if the temperature is below freezing, then the water freezes. But technically, the freezing happens when the temperature reaches 0°C. So at -10°C, the water is already frozen. So Bob's statement is incorrect. But maybe he's thinking that since -10°C is below freezing, the water must be frozen, so "it freezes" is a shorthand for "it is frozen." But in standard terms, "freezes" is the action, not the state.

Wait, but in common language, sometimes people say "it freezes" when they mean "it's frozen." Like, "At -10°C, water freezes." But that's actually incorrect. The correct statement would be "At -10°C, water is frozen." So Bob is using the wrong verb. So Alice is correct that water freezes at 0°C, and Bob's answer is wrong. But Bob insists he's still right. So why?

Wait, maybe Bob is correct in a different way. Let's see. If the question is "What happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius?" and Bob says "It freezes," but actually, at -10°C, the water is already frozen, so the process of freezing has already happened. So the answer should be "It is frozen." But Bob says "It freezes," which is the process. So his answer is wrong. But maybe Bob is thinking that the temperature being below 0°C means that freezing occurs, so "it freezes" is correct. But that's a misunderstanding. The freezing occurs when the temperature drops to 0°C, not at -10°C. So at -10°C, the water is frozen, not freezing.

Wait, but maybe the question is phrased as "What happens to water at -10°C?" So if you have water at -10°C, what's the state? It's ice. So the answer is "It is frozen." But Bob says "It freezes," which would mean the process is happening. So if the water is at -10°C, it's not in the process of freezing; it's already frozen. So Bob is wrong. But he says he's still right. So why?

Wait, maybe Bob is correct because at -10°C, water does freeze, meaning that if you have liquid water and you cool it to -10°C, it will freeze. But the question is "What happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius?" So the temperature is -10°C. So if the water is at that temperature, it's already frozen. So the answer is "It is frozen." But Bob says "It freezes," which is the process. So the answer should be "It is frozen," not "It freezes." So Bob's answer is incorrect. But he claims he's still right. So maybe he's being pedantic or there's a trick here.

Wait, another angle: the freezing point is 0°C, so below that, water is frozen. So at -10°C, water is frozen. So Bob's statement "It freezes" is incorrect because "freezes" is the action, but the correct statement is "It is frozen." However, maybe in some contexts, people say "it freezes" to mean "it becomes frozen," so at -10°C, it's frozen, so "it freezes" is a way of saying it's in the frozen state. But that's not standard. The verb "freeze" is the process, so "it freezes" means the process is occurring. So if the temperature is -10°C, the process of freezing has already occurred, so the correct answer is "it is frozen."

Wait, but let's check the exact wording. Alice asks, "What happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius?" So "happens" could refer to the state or the process. If the question is asking for the state, then "it is frozen." If it's asking for the process, then "it freezes" would be the process, but the process happens at 0°C, not at -10°C. So the process of freezing occurs when the temperature reaches 0°C, so at -10°C, the process has already happened. Therefore, the correct answer is "it is frozen," so Bob is wrong. But Bob says he's still right. So why?

Wait, maybe Bob is correct because the temperature is below freezing, so water must be frozen. So even though the process of freezing happens at 0°C, at -10°C, the water is frozen. So Bob's answer "It freezes" is a shorthand for "it is frozen," and in common language, people might say that. So maybe Bob is technically incorrect, but in everyday language, he's considered right. But the question is asking who is right, so we need to be precise.

The problem states that Alice says, "Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius," which is correct. Bob says, "It freezes," and then says, "Yes, but I'm still right." So Alice is correct about the freezing point, but Bob's answer to the question "What happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius?" is "It freezes." So the question is whether "It freezes" is the correct answer to that question.

In scientific terms, the correct answer is "It is frozen," because at -10°C, the water is in solid form. The process of freezing (the transition from liquid to solid) occurs at 0°C. So if the question is asking for the state at -10°C, the answer is "frozen," not "freezes." Therefore, Bob's answer is incorrect. But Bob claims he's still right. So why would he think that?

Wait, maybe Bob is interpreting the question as "What happens when water is at -10°C?" and he's saying that the water freezes, meaning that it undergoes freezing. But that's not accurate because freezing happens when the temperature drops to 0°C. If the water is already at -10°C, it's already frozen. So the process of freezing would have occurred when it went from 0°C to below, but at -10°C, it's already frozen. So Bob's answer is wrong.

But Bob says, "Yes, but I'm still right." So maybe he's making a logical point. Let's see. If water freezes at 0°C, then at any temperature below 0°C, the water is frozen. So at -10°C, which is below 0°C, the water is frozen. So Bob's statement "It freezes" is a bit off, but if he means that the water is frozen (i.e., it has frozen), then maybe he's using "freezes" to mean "is frozen." But that's a misuse of the verb. The verb "freeze" is intransitive when talking about the process, so "water freezes" means the process happens. "Water is frozen" is the state.

Wait, but maybe Bob is correct because the freezing point is 0°C, so below that, it's frozen. So "it freezes" at temperatures below 0°C. Wait, but "it freezes" would mean the process occurs. So if you have water at 0°C, it freezes. If you have water at -10°C, it's already frozen, so the process of freezing has already happened. So the correct answer to "What happens to water at -10°C?" is "It is frozen," not "It freezes."

Therefore, Alice is correct that water freezes at 0°C, and Bob is incorrect in saying "It freezes" for -10°C. But Bob insists he's still right. So why? Maybe Bob is thinking that since -10°C is below freezing, the water must be frozen, so "it freezes" is a way of saying it's frozen. But that's a common mistake. So in reality, Bob is wrong, but he's claiming he's right. So the question is, who is right?

Wait, but the problem says "Who is right? Explain briefly." So the answer should be that Alice is correct, and Bob is wrong. But Bob says he's still right. Wait, but maybe there's a trick. Let's think again.

Wait, the freezing point is 0°C, so at exactly 0°C, water freezes. Below 0°C, it's frozen. So at -10°C, water is frozen. So the correct answer is "It is frozen." Bob says "It freezes," which is incorrect. So Alice is right about the freezing point, and Bob is wrong about the answer to the question. But Bob says, "Yes, but I'm still right." So why would he think that?

Wait, maybe Bob is correct in a different way. Let's consider the statement: "Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius." That's correct. Then, when asked about -10°C, Bob says "It freezes." But if the question is "What happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius?" and Bob says "It freezes," he's implying that the process of freezing occurs at -10°C, which is wrong. But if he's saying that at -10°C, the water is frozen (i.e., it has frozen), then he's using "freezes" incorrectly. So his answer is wrong.

But maybe Bob is making a logical point. If water freezes at 0°C, then at any temperature below 0°C, the water is frozen. So "it freezes" (meaning it has undergone freezing) is true for temperatures below 0°C. So Bob might be saying that since the temperature is below freezing, the water has frozen, so "it freezes" is correct in the sense that the freezing has occurred. But the verb tense is off. "It freezes" is present tense, which would mean the process is happening now. But if the water is at -10°C, the process of freezing already happened. So the correct present tense would be "It is frozen."

Wait, but maybe Bob is using "freezes" as a state. Like, "At -10°C, water freezes" meaning "water is frozen." But that's not standard English. In standard English, "freezes" is the verb for the process. So "water freezes" means the process of turning to ice. "Water is frozen" means it's in the solid state.

So Bob's answer is incorrect. Therefore, Alice is right, and Bob is wrong. But Bob says he's still right. So the answer should be that Alice is correct, and Bob is mistaken. But the question is asking who is right. So Alice is right about the freezing point, but the question is about what happens at -10°C. So the main point is whether Bob's answer to the question is correct.

Wait, the question is: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" So the answer should be the state at that temperature. So "it is frozen." Bob says "it freezes," which is the process. So Bob is wrong. Therefore, Alice is correct in her correction, and Bob is wrong. But Bob claims he's still right. So the answer is Alice is right, Bob is wrong.

Wait, but let me check if there's any other angle. For example, if the water is supercooled. Wait, supercooled water can exist below 0°C without freezing, but that's a special case. The question doesn't mention supercooling, so we can assume standard conditions. So under normal conditions, at -10°C, water is frozen. So Bob's answer is wrong.

Therefore, the correct answer is that Alice is right. Bob is wrong because water freezes at 0°C, so at -10°C, it's already frozen, not freezing. So Bob's statement "It freezes" is incorrect; the correct statement is "It is frozen." Hence, Alice is correct, and Bob is mistaken. But Bob insists he's still right, but he's not. So the answer should be Alice is right.

Wait, but the problem says "Bob: 'It freezes.' Alice: 'No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius.' Bob: 'Yes, but I'm still right.'" So Bob is agreeing that water freezes at 0°C, but he's saying that his answer "It freezes" is still correct. So he's saying that even though water freezes at 0°C, at -10°C, it still freezes. But that's not true. So Bob is wrong. So the answer is Alice is right.

Wait, but maybe Bob is correct because if you have water at -10°C, it's frozen, so the fact that it's frozen is because it froze (at 0°C). So "it freezes" refers to the fact that it has undergone freezing. But the verb tense is present, so "it freezes" would mean it's currently freezing, which isn't the case. So Bob's answer is still incorrect.

Another way: the question is "What happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius?" So the answer is "It is frozen." Bob says "It freezes," which is a different thing. So Alice is correct in pointing out that the freezing point is 0°C, and Bob's answer is wrong. So Alice is right, Bob is wrong.

Therefore, the answer should be Alice is correct. But let me confirm. Let's look up similar questions. For example, if someone asks, "What happens to water at 5°C?" The answer is "It's liquid." At 0°C, "It freezes." At -5°C, "It's frozen." So yes, the correct answer for -10°C is "It's frozen," so Bob's answer "It freezes" is wrong. So Alice is right, Bob is wrong. So the answer is Alice is right.
</think>

Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0°C, meaning the **process** of freezing occurs at that temperature. At **-10°C**, water is already **frozen** (in solid state), not in the process of freezing. Bob's answer "It freezes" incorrectly describes the **state** (frozen) as the **process** (freezing). While Bob agrees water freezes at 0°C, his statement about -10°C is scientifically inaccurate. Thus, **Alice is right**, and Bob is wrong. His claim that he is "still right" is incorrect. 

**Answer:** Alice is right. Water freezes at 0°C, so at -10°C, it is frozen—not freezing. Bob's answer misstates the process vs. the state. [end of text]
