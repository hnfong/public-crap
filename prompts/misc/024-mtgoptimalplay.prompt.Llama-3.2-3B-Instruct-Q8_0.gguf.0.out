In this situation, Alice's optimal play is to cast Kindle on Orim. Here's why:

1.  **Damage Calculation**: Kindle's ability states that it deals 2 damage plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards. Since there is only one Kindle in the graveyard (Alice's other Kindle), the total damage dealt by Kindle will be 2 + 1 = 3.

2.  **Orim's Ability**: Orim's ability states that it prevents the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. Since the damage dealt by Kindle is 3, Orim's ability will prevent the damage from being dealt, effectively canceling out the damage.

3.  **Outcome**: After the damage is prevented, the game state remains unchanged. Orim is still on the battlefield, and Alice's hand still contains two Kindles.

As for Bob's play, his optimal play is to untap Orim. Here's why:

1.  **Mana Availability**: Since Bob's lands are tapped out, he has no available mana to cast any spells. However, untapping Orim does not require any mana.

2.  **Orim's Ability**: By untapping Orim, Bob can use its ability to prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. Since Alice has already cast Kindle, which would have dealt 3 damage to Orim, untapping Orim will prevent the damage from being dealt.

3.  **Outcome**: After untapping Orim, the game state remains unchanged. Orim is still on the battlefield, and Bob's hand still contains no cards.

In summary, Alice's optimal play is to cast Kindle on Orim, and Bob's optimal play is to untap Orim to prevent the damage from being dealt. [end of text]
