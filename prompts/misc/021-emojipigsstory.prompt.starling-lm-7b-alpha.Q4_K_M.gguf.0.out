🐖🐖🐖 Three little pigs are building their houses. 
🏠🏠🏠 One pig builds a house of straw, another builds a house of sticks, and the third pig builds a house of bricks. 
🐺🐺🐺 A big, bad wolf comes along and tries to blow down the straw house, but it's too weak and falls down. 
🔥🔥🔥 The wolf eats the first pig, but moves on to the second pig's stick house. 
🏭🏭🏭 The stick house is also too weak and falls down. 
👎👎👎 The wolf eats the second pig, but the third pig's brick house is too strong. 
🏆🏆🏆 The wolf can't blow it down, so he runs away. 
🎉🎉🎉 The third pig is safe and happy, and the wolf never bothers him again. 
🏠🏠🏠 The three pigs live happily ever after in their strong brick house. 
🥳🥳🥳
