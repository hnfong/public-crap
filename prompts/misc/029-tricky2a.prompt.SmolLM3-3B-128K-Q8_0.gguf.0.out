Bob is correct in the context of the conversation. He said, "It freezes," which is true because water does indeed freeze at -10 degrees Celsius. However, Alice is also correct in pointing out that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius. The key here is understanding that freezing is the process of turning a liquid into a solid, and it occurs at a specific temperature for each substance. For water, that temperature is 0 degrees Celsius. Bob's statement is accurate in that water does freeze at -10 degrees Celsius, but it's not the temperature at which it freezes. Alice's correction is about the specific temperature at which the freezing process occurs, not about the fact that water does freeze. [end of text]
