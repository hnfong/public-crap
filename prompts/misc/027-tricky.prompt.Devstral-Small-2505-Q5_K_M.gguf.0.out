A) Water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius. However, water can remain liquid below this temperature in a supercooled state, which is a metastable state where the water has not yet crystallized into ice.

B) If a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will likely freeze. However, it's possible that the water could remain in a supercooled state, depending on various factors such as the presence of impurities, the rate of cooling, and the container's material. If the water does freeze, it will form ice crystals and expand, which could potentially cause the glass to break. [end of text]
