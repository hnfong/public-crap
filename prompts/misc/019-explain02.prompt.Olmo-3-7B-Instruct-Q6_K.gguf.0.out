Okay, imagine you have a big, grown-up club at school called the "Student Council." This club makes all the rules for the class and can say what should happen if someone is being mean or breaks the rules.

Now, China has a super big club called the **National People’s Congress (NPC)**. It’s even bigger and older than your school’s Student Council! All the grown-ups in China, like the President and lots of important people, are part of this club.

Their job is to help make the big rules for the whole country, like how much money people get paid, what laws we have, and how to take care of everyone in China. They also check if the leaders are being good and follow the rules themselves.

So, the National People’s Congress is like the biggest, most important club in China where all the grown-ups come together to help everyone in the country and make sure things are fair and good! Even though you live in London, it’s a big club that helps lots of people far away from China too. [end of text]
