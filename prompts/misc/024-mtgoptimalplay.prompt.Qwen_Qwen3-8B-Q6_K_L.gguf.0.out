Let's break down the scenario and analyze the optimal play for both Alice and Bob, using Magic: The Gathering rules as of 2024.

---

### **Current Game State Summary:**

- **Alice's Hand:** Two copies of **Kindle** (instant spell, deals X damage to any target, where X = 2 + number of **Kindle** cards in all graveyards).
- **Bob's Board:** **Orim, Samite Healer** (Legendary Creature, 1/3, tap ability: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn).
- **Bob's Lands:** All tapped (no more mana).
- **Turn:** Alice's turn.
- **Orim** is untapped and has been on the board for a while (no summoning sickness).

---

## **Alice's Objective:**
Alice wants to **kill Orim** as it's a threat to her burn deck. She has two **Kindle** cards in hand and enough mana to cast them.

---

## **Bob's Objective:**
Bob wants to **survive** and prevent Alice from removing Orim. He has no cards in hand, and his lands are tapped, so he can't cast spells or tap lands for mana.

---

## **Game Mechanics to Consider:**

- **Kindle** is an **instant** spell, so it can be cast at any time during a player's turn, including during the opponent's turn (if the player has priority).
- **Orim's** tap ability can be used **once per turn**, and it prevents the **next 3 damage** that would be dealt to any target **this turn**.
- **Damage is dealt in the order of the effects**, so if multiple sources of damage are applied, the **prevent** effect will apply to the **first 3 damage** dealt to a target **this turn**.
- **Graveyard effects** are resolved **after** the spell is cast, so **Kindle** will only count in the graveyard **after** it's been cast and placed there.

---

## **Alice's Thought Process:**

Alice has two **Kindle** cards. She wants to kill **Orim**, which is a 1/3 creature. To kill it, she needs to deal **at least 4 damage** to it (since it has 3 toughness and is a creature, it needs to be reduced to 0 or less).

She has two **Kindle** cards. Let's analyze the possible outcomes:

### **Option 1: Cast both Kindles in sequence.**

- **First Kindle:**  
  - X = 2 + number of **Kindle** in graveyards = 2 + 0 = 2  
  - Deals **2 damage** to Orim.  
  - Orim now has **1 toughness** left.  
  - **Kindle** goes to graveyard.

- **Second Kindle:**  
  - X = 2 + number of **Kindle** in graveyards = 2 + 1 = 3  
  - Deals **3 damage** to Orim.  
  - Total damage = 2 + 3 = **5**  
  - Orim is destroyed.

**Outcome:** Orim is killed. Alice wins.

### **Option 2: Cast one Kindle, then the other.**

Same as Option 1. The order doesn't matter because the second Kindle will always see the first one in the graveyard.

---

## **Bob's Thought Process:**

Bob has no cards in hand and no lands to tap. He can't cast spells or tap lands for mana. His only option is to **tap Orim** to use its ability.

- **Orim's tap ability** prevents the **next 3 damage** that would be dealt to any target **this turn**.
- If Alice casts both **Kindle** cards, the total damage is **5**, which would be **2 + 3**.
- The **first 3 damage** is prevented by Orim's ability.
- The **remaining 2 damage** is still dealt to Orim, which is enough to kill it.

So, even if Bob taps Orim, he can only prevent **3 damage**, and the **remaining 2 damage** will still kill Orim.

---

## **Conclusion:**

### **Optimal Play:**

- **Alice** should cast both **Kindle** cards in sequence (or in any order).
- **Bob** has no way to prevent the damage, as he can't cast spells or tap lands for mana.
- **Orim** will be destroyed by the combined damage of the two **Kindle** cards.

---

## **Final Outcome:**

- **Alice** successfully kills **Orim**.
- **Bob** has no way to prevent the damage, and his only threat is destroyed.
- **Alice wins the game**.

---

## **Why This is the Optimal Play:**

- **Alice** has the resources (mana and cards) to deal the necessary damage.
- **Bob** has no way to respond or prevent the damage.
- **Kindle** is a **burn spell** that becomes more powerful as it's played, due to its graveyard effect.
- **Orim's** ability is not enough to save it in this scenario.

---

## **Game Theory Insight:**

This is a classic example of **burn vs. life gain** or **threat removal**. Alice's **Kindle** is a **self-boosting burn spell**, which makes it a strong tool in a burn deck. Bob's **Orim** is a **life gain** or **threat removal** creature, but in this case, it's not enough to save him due to the **power of the burn spells** and the **lack of resources** to respond.

---

### ✅ **Final Answer:**

Alice should cast both **Kindle** cards. Orim will be destroyed by the combined damage (2 + 3 = 5), and Bob has no way to prevent it. **Alice wins the game.** [end of text]
