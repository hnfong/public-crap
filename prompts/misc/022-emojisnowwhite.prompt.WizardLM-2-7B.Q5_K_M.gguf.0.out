ASSISTANT: 👧🏼🧚‍♀️ Once upon a time, in a 🏰 atop a 🏞️, there lived a princess named Snow White ❄️👑. She had skin as 🌫️ and lips as 🍓. Her beauty was so profound that even the 🐦 in the forest stopped to admire her. But with beauty came envy, and the most wicked 👫 of all, the Evil Queen 🫫, grew green with jealousy.

The Evil Queen, determined to be the fairest of them all, summoned a 🧙‍♂️ to grant her a potion that would make her the most beautiful in the land. But the spell backfired, and instead of youth, she was transformed into an 🕷️, cursing Snow White to wither and die when her skin no longer held the 💫 of youth.

Snow White, heartbroken 💔, fled into the 🌳, where she lived with 🐿️, 🦊, and 🐦, who became her friends. They showed her the wonders of the forest and the simple joys of life away from the opulence of the palace.

Meanwhile, the Evil Queen, still in her 🕷️ form, sent her 👩‍🦰🍎 to find Snow White and poison her. But the huntsman 🏹, moved by Snow White's kindness, could not bear to harm her. He took the apple and instead led the Queen's men to where the 🐻 had found Snow White, asleep in a 🌲.

The huntsman, filled with regret, kissed Snow White awake, breaking the spell. The 👫 were astounded by her vitality and realized the Queen's deception. They captured the Evil Queen, who was ultimately turned into 🧤 by a 🏹, fulfilling the prophecy that she would meet her end at the hands of the man she once deceived.

Snow White, now wiser and more radiant than ever, returned to her kingdom, where she ruled with compassion and grace. She invited all, including the 🐻, 🐿️, and 🦊, to share in her kingdom's bounty. And from that day forth, the forest and the palace lived in harmony, with Snow White as the beloved 👸🏼 who valued the beauty of the heart over the fleeting charm of appearances. 🌈💖
