Imagine you're in a big playground where all the kids help decide the rules—like what games to play, when snack time is, and how to keep everyone safe. Now, think of China’s National People’s Congress (NPC) as the **biggest meeting of grown-up helpers** in China, kind of like a giant school council for the whole country.

Here’s how it works, in simple words:

1. **They Make Important Rules**  
   Just like your teacher and classmates agree on classroom rules, the NPC meets once a year to talk about big decisions for China—like how to build new hospitals, schools, or roads.

2. **They Choose the Leaders**  
   Imagine your class voting for a team captain. The NPC helps pick very important leaders, like the President, who helps run the country.

3. **They Listen and Decide**  
   People from every part of China—like farmers, doctors, and teachers—can become NPC members. They bring ideas from their hometowns, just like you might tell your teacher what games your friends want to play.

4. **It’s Like a Big Team Talk**  
   Every March, thousands of these helpers gather in Beijing (China’s capital) for a huge meeting. They discuss plans, ask questions, and vote—like when your family decides where to go on holiday, but for a whole country!

So, while you live in London and know about Parliament or the Mayor, China has the NPC—a special group that helps make big choices for over 1.4 billion people. It’s their way of working together, just like how your school or family makes plans as a team.

Would you like to draw a picture of your own "helper meeting" for your toys? 😊 [end of text]
