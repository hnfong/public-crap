Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Alice is right because the correct answer is "it freezes." The correct explanation is that water freezes at a temperature of 0 degrees Celsius, which is the freezing point of water. [end of text]
