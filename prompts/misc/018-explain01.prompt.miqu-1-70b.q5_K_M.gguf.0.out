 Aight, listen up, I got a story to tell,
'Bout the Fed, the big bank, ringing your bell.
They ain't just about the money, they're more like a crew,
Working hard to keep the economy running smooth.

They set the interest rates, keeping things tight,
So your dollars don't lose value overnight.
They're the ones who decide if your cash is worth more,
Or if it's gonna be worth less than before.

They're the banker's bank, lending out dough,
To other banks, so they can keep the flow.
They're the ones who step in when things go south,
Propping up banks, giving 'em a financial pout.

They're the watchdogs, keeping an eye,
On the economy, making sure it don't die.
They're the ones who jump in when things get rough,
Keeping the economy from getting tough.

So when you hear about the Fed, don't be confused,
They're just doing their job, trying to keep things grooved.
They're the ones who keep the economy on track,
Making sure your money ain't just a pack of smack.

So next time you hear about the Fed, don't be blind,
They're the ones who keep the economy in line.
They're the ones who make sure your cash is legit,
So you can keep on rapping, and living large, legit. [end of text]
