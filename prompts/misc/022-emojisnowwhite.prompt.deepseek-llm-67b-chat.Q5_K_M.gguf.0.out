👸🏼 Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom, there lived a beautiful princess named Snow White. She had hair as black as ebony, lips as red as roses, and skin as white as snow. 🌟

🏰 Snow White's stepmother, the queen, was jealous of her beauty and consulted a magic mirror every day. "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?" 🪞

🗣️ The mirror always replied, "My queen, you are the fairest in the land." But one day, the mirror said, "My queen, Snow White is now the fairest." 😱

😠 Enraged, the queen ordered a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. But the huntsman couldn't bring himself to harm the innocent princess, so he let her go. 🌳

🏃‍♀️ Snow White ran deeper into the forest and stumbled upon a cottage inhabited by seven dwarfs. They took her in and treated her like family. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑

🍎 Meanwhile, the queen disguised herself as an old woman and offered Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White took a bite and fell into a deep sleep. 😴

💔 The dwarfs found her and placed her in a glass coffin, heartbroken. But a prince passing by saw her and fell in love with her beauty. He kissed her, and the spell was broken. ❤️

👰‍♀️ Snow White and the prince got married, and they lived happily ever after. The wicked queen was punished for her jealousy and cruelty. 💔

🌟 And Snow White's beauty and kindness shone like a beacon in the kingdom, inspiring everyone to be kind and compassionate. The end. ✨
