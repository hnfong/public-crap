Literal, “this-really-happened-in-the-story” reading

A child (or any wanderer) follows a trail of acorns that the wind seems to keep moving; the trail never quite arrives anywhere.  
At the very moment the searcher gives up, the forest itself opens like a curtain and reveals a doll-house-sized restaurant that was never there before.  
The place is run by the “forgotten ones” – people who slipped out of living memory and therefore out of the world of the living.  
Because nobody remembers them, the reservation book is blank; because nobody remembers them, the dining room is empty even at lunch hour.  
The only other customers are birds that flutter in and out, laughing like mischievous children who know the rules of the place.

The roof is painted a glaring red so that lost souls can spot it; the menu lists only “today’s special” because the kitchen serves whatever the visitor happened to forget he ever loved to eat.  
While the dishes are being prepared, the cooks (the forgotten dead) amuse themselves with a little string quartet: violin, flute, cello, viola – music that sounds cheerful but is tuned a quarter-tone off, giving everything a tipsy, carnival feel.

When the wanderer sits down, the wait-staff (tiny bears that can perch on a human hand) greet him with:

“Welcome, welcome!  
Eat your fill and you’ll fall asleep.  
Good-night, good-night, everybody!  
Tomorrow is tomorrow, etcetera…”

Course after course appears from left to right in frantic, almost comical procession—carpaccio, paella, hors-d’oeuvres, risotto—yet every time the diner asks for dessert he is told there isn’t any.  
The last line of the song is the staff’s cheerful promise: “We’ll deliver the dessert to your grave,” meaning the meal will not end until the visitor himself has become a forgotten person and joined the staff.  
The “full-course” being served tonight is therefore the final one of the visitor’s life; once he finishes he will be carried, still smiling, through the back door that opens onto his own tomb.  
The light-hearted, mischievous melody is the sound of the restaurant’s trap: it makes the fatal contract feel like a party.

So the story is a pocket-sized “Last Supper” hidden in the woods: if you find yourself inside, you have already disappeared from the world’s memory, and the empty dessert plate is the last thing you will ever see. [end of text]
