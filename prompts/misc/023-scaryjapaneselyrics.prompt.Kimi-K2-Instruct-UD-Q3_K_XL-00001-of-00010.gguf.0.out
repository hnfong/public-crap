Literal, fantastical reading – what actually happens in the song-world  

1.  A traveler tries to reach a restaurant that rumor says lies deep in the forest.  
   「ドングリを辿っても着きません」  
   He follows the trail of acorns that supposedly leads to it, yet the path loops and he never quite arrives.  The acorns are not just markers; they are part of the spell that keeps the place half-hidden.  Only people who have “forgotten” something important can cross the threshold.  When the traveler finally gives up and admits he has forgotten why he came, the door appears.

2.  Inside he finds a tiny, bright-red tin-roofed café that should seat no more than four, yet its interior is an endless hall of empty tables.  It is always lunch-time and always deserted except for the birds perched on chair-backs, tittering like amused children.

3.  There is no written menu; the waiter (a chipmunk in a waistcoat) simply announces “today’s recommendation” and that becomes the entire menu.  The kitchen, however, is alive with sound: four forest animals (a squirrel on violin, a blue jay on flute, a badger on cello, and a mole on viola) play a perpetual serenade that drifts through the swinging doors.

4.  The meal is served right to left in a dizzying parade—carpaccio, paella, hors d’oeuvres, risotto—yet the plates are never set on the table; they float in mid-air and vanish the instant a diner tries to choose.  Dessert is explicitly “not available,” because the restaurant only serves what you have already tasted in your life.  If you have no memory of dessert, none can be given.

5.  The moment you are full, sleep overtakes you.  The staff tuck every guest beneath the tablecloth like a napkin and, while you dream, carry you to the back door.  There a small sign reads: “We deliver to anywhere, even graves.”  The sleeper is slid gently into a hollow log that rolls downhill and, by dawn, arrives at whatever place the guest truly belongs—even if that place is six feet underground.

6.  The chorus is the restaurant’s own farewell:  
   “Welcome, welcome—eat your fill and doze off.  Good-bye, everyone.  Tomorrow will take care of tomorrow.”  
   The phrase “tomorrow is tomorrow, et cetera” is the spell that resets the day; the same lunch, the same music, the same empty seats wait for the next wanderer who has forgotten something.

7.  The last line is not a threat but a promise of the house: no matter how far you have wandered in life, the little restaurant will see that you reach your final rest properly fed.  The “last full-course” is literally the last meal you will ever need, served with music and laughter, after which the forest re-absorbs the building until another lost soul remembers to forget.
