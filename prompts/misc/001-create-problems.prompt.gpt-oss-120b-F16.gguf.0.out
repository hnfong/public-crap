<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to produce a set of 8 questions (Q1 to Q8) meeting constraints.

Constraints:

(a) Simple, concise, within paragraph or two.

(b) Difficulty increasing from Q1 easy to Q8 hard.

(c) Mix English and Chinese.

(d) Wide range of topics.

(e) Objective assessment: multiple choice or short answer.

(f) Be creative.

(g) For English questions, all questions must contain at least a word with "z" character. So each English question must have a word containing "z". Could be "zebra", "quiz", "buzz", "size", "fizz", "puzzle", "amazing", "crazy", "lazy", "horizon", etc. Must ensure each English question includes at least one such word.

(h) For Chinese questions, all must use the character "平" at least once. So each Chinese question must contain "平". Could be "平衡", "平面", "平时", "平常", "平等", "平安", etc.

(i) Provide answer key optionally.

We need to mix English and Chinese. Could have e.g., Q1 English, Q2 Chinese, Q3 English, Q4 Chinese, etc. Ensure each English question includes a "z" word. Each Chinese includes "平". Provide answer key after.

Also need to increase difficulty gradually. So Q1 easy, Q8 hardest.

Let's design topics: math, science, literature, geography, history, programming, logic puzzles, ethics.

Make sure each question is concise.

Let's produce:

Q1 (easy) English: maybe a basic factual question with "z". Eg: "What is the capital city of Brazil?" Need a "z" word: "quiz". Could phrase: "In this quick quiz, what is the capital city of Brazil?" That includes "quiz". Good.

Q2 Chinese easy: maybe ask about Chinese zodiac? Must include "平". Eg: "中国的平常星期几是周一到周日，哪一天被称为‘平安夜’?" Not good. Simpler: "在中国的平常日历中，农历新年通常在公历的哪几个月之间？" Contains "平常". That's okay.

But need objective answer: month range.

Q3 English medium: maybe a math problem with "z". Eg: "What is the sum of the first five positive even numbers? (Provide a single integer.)" Need "z" word: "zesty". Could phrase: "Solve this zesty math question: What is the sum of the first five positive even numbers?" Good.

Q4 Chinese medium: maybe a science question with "平". Eg: "在物理学中，平衡状态指的是物体所受的合力为多少？" Answer: zero. Good.

Q5 English harder: maybe a logic puzzle with "z". Eg: "A zebra crossing puzzle: If a zebra moves 3 meters east then 4 meters north, what is its straight‑line distance from the start point? Round to two decimal places." Contains "zebra". Good.

Q6 Chinese harder: maybe a literature question with "平". Eg: "《平凡的世界》是路遥的代表作，请指出该小说的主角姓氏是什么？" Answer: Sun (孙). Good.

Q7 English hard: maybe programming: "In Python, which built‑in function returns the length of a sequence? (Give the exact function name.)" Need "z" word: "zany". Could phrase: "Answer this zany coding query: In Python, which built‑in function returns the length of a sequence?" Answer: len.

Q8 Chinese hardest: maybe a philosophy/ethics question requiring short answer but objective: "请用一句话概括康德的‘平等’原则在现代伦理学中的核心含义。" Must include "平等". Provide answer key: "所有理性主体应被视为具有同等的内在价值。" Something like that.

But need to ensure each Chinese question includes "平". Use "平衡", "平面", "平等", "平常", "平安", etc.

Now ensure difficulty progression: Q1 easy factual, Q2 easy factual, Q3 simple arithmetic, Q4 physics concept, Q5 geometry calculation, Q6 literature, Q7 programming, Q8 philosophy.

Now produce answer key after.

Make sure each question is concise, within paragraph or two.

Let's write them.
