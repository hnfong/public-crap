<think>
We are looking for lines that contain dialog or spoken text. This means lines that have direct speech, typically enclosed in quotation marks or indicated by some other convention (like being on a line by themselves with a dash or other marker). In the given input, we see that spoken text is often enclosed in Chinese quotation marks (「」) or sometimes in English quotes (""), but note that the input is in Cantonese and uses Chinese punctuation.

However, note the instruction: "Only trigger when the input obviously matches the query, i.e. not tangentially related." So we are only to output lines that have actual spoken words (dialog).

Let's go through the input line by line:

Line 1: "# 呆總嘅老豆" -> This is a title or comment (starts with #), not dialog.
Line 2: empty
Line 3: empty
Line 4: 「轟隆！」 -> This is an onomatopoeic expression in quotes, representing a sound (thunder). It is spoken? Actually, it's written as if it's a sound effect in the narrative, but note that in comics or narratives, such sounds are sometimes considered as part of the dialog or as spoken? However, the instruction says "dialog or spoken text". This is a sound effect, not spoken by a character. But wait, in some contexts, it might be considered as the narrator's representation of a sound. However, the problem says "spoken text", meaning words that are spoken by a character. This is not spoken by a character but is a sound. However, note that in the context of the story, it might be intended as the sound of thunder, which isn't spoken. But let's see: in line 12 we have 「轟隆！」 again, and then it says "呢次雷聲", so it's the sound of thunder. So not spoken by a character.

But wait, in some narratives, sound effects are written as if they are part of the dialog? Actually, no. They are not spoken by a character. So we skip.

However, note that in line 8: 「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」 -> This is spoken by the character (the narrator, who is a character in the story). So that is dialog.

So let's define: we want lines that contain text that is spoken by a character in the story. Typically, these are enclosed in quotation marks (either 「」 or “”) and represent what a character says.

Looking at the input:

Line 4: 「轟隆！」 -> This is a sound effect, not spoken by a character? Actually, in Chinese comics, sometimes sound effects are written without attribution, but they are not dialog. However, note that in the story, it might be that the character is exclaiming "轟隆!"? But that doesn't make sense because "轟隆" is the sound of thunder. So it's not spoken by a character. It's a narrative sound.

But let's compare with line 8: 「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」

Here, 「啊～！」 and 「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」 are spoken by the character (the narrator). So they are dialog.

Similarly, line 27: 「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」 -> clearly spoken.

So the rule: if the line contains text that is inside quotation marks (「」) and that text is something that a character would say (like an exclamation, a sentence, etc.), then it's dialog.

But note: sometimes the dialog might span multiple lines? However, in this input, each dialog is on a single line.

Also note: line 46: 「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」 -> dialog.

But what about line 39: 「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 -> dialog.

Now, what about line 12: 「轟隆！」 -> same as line 4? It's a sound effect. However, note that in the context, it's written as if it's a sound, but the problem says "spoken text". So we should not include sound effects.

But wait, in some contexts, a character might say "轟隆!" to imitate thunder? However, in this story, it's clearly the sound of thunder (as per the next line: "呢次雷聲"). So it's not spoken by a character.

Therefore, we will only include lines that have dialog that is spoken by a character.

Let's list the lines that have dialog:

Line 4: 「轟隆！」 -> but this is a sound effect, not spoken by a character? Actually, in the story, it's the sound of thunder, so not spoken. However, note that in Chinese writing, sometimes sound effects are written in the same way as dialog. But the problem says "spoken text", meaning words that are uttered by a character. So we skip.

But wait, line 8 has two parts: 
  「啊～！」 ... 「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」
So line 8 has two dialog snippets.

Similarly, line 12: 「轟隆！」 -> again, sound of thunder, not spoken.

Line 27: 「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」 -> spoken.

Line 29: 「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」 -> spoken.

Line 39: 「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 -> spoken.

Line 46: 「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」 -> spoken.

Line 48: 「？？？」 -> This is the black衣人's reaction, so it's representing what the character is saying (or thinking? but in context, it's a spoken reaction). However, note that it's in quotes. So we include.

Line 50: 「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」 -> spoken.

Also, note line 8: it has two dialog parts. The entire line is:

8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」

So the line contains dialog.

Similarly, line 29: 
29:「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。難怪我同佢對打可以力拔山河。平時我邊有咁大力？佢口裡強硬，卻一個翻身跳出牆外，似乎想逃走。

This line has dialog at the beginning and then narrative.

So we output the entire line if it contains any dialog.

Now, what about line 4: 
4:「轟隆！」

This is a line that is entirely a sound effect. But is it spoken? The problem says "spoken text". Since it's a sound effect and not words spoken by a character, we skip.

Similarly, line 12: 
12:「轟隆！」 呢次雷聲，果然帶來傾盤大雨，屋外屋頂雨聲不絕。

Here, the 「轟隆！」 is again a sound effect, not spoken by a character.

But note: in some stories, a character might exclaim "轟隆!" to mimic thunder? However, in this context, the next part says "呢次雷聲", meaning "this thunder sound", so it's the actual thunder. So not spoken.

Therefore, we will not include lines 4 and 12.

Now, let's list all the lines that have dialog (spoken by a character):

- Line 8: contains two dialog parts: 「啊～！」 and 「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」
- Line 27: 「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」
- Line 29: 「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」
- Line 39: 「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」
- Line 41: has 「！！！」 but note: line 41 is: 「！！！」 黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我。 ... -> but wait, the dialog is only the 「！！！」? Actually, the line says: 「！！！」 黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我。 ... -> so the 「！！！」 is representing what the black衣人 is saying (or rather, the exclamation marks as speech). So we include line 41? But note: the problem says "spoken text", and exclamation marks are a form of written representation of speech (like "!!!"). So yes, it's dialog.

However, let's check the exact line 41:

41:「！！！」 黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我。佢點都估唔到我認得呢把劍。原來係熔癌派人追殺我。

So the 「！！！」 is at the beginning and is in quotes, so it's intended as what the black衣人 said (or expressed). So we include.

Similarly, line 46: 「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」
Line 48: 「？？？」 
Line 50: 「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」

Also, note line 8 is one line that has dialog.

But what about line 25? It says: 好在老夫力拔山河氣蓋世，雖然咁樣斬法我把寶劍肯定見財化水，但刀劍相交嘅時候，我感覺到對方力氣似乎比我大大不如。

This is narrative, no dialog.

Now, let's list the line numbers that have dialog:

- 8
- 27
- 29
- 39
- 41
- 46
- 48
- 50

Wait, line 41: we have 「！！！」 which is dialog.

But note: line 48: 「？？？」 -> same idea.

Also, line 4: we decided not to include because it's a sound effect.

But let me double-check line 4 and 12: they are the only ones with 「轟隆！」 and they are clearly sound effects (thunder). So skip.

Now, what about line 23? 
23:腳步聲越嚟越近，我腰間寶劍出鞘嘅一刻，廳門已經「嘭！」一聲被踢爆。

Here, 「嘭！」 is a sound effect (the sound of the door being kicked in). It's not spoken by a character. So skip.

Similarly, line 33: 
33:我提劍急追，佢見我迫近，回身一劍，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕。

Here, 「屌」一聲 -> this is a bit tricky. "屌" is a vulgar word, and it's written as if the character is exclaiming it. So it is spoken? Yes, because it says "我「屌」一聲", meaning "I exclaimed '屌'". So the word "屌" is spoken by the character.

Therefore, line 33 contains dialog: the word "屌" is spoken.

So we must include line 33.

Similarly, in line 8, we have 「啊～！」 which is an exclamation.

So line 33: 
33:我提劍急追，佢見我迫近，回身一劍，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕。

This line has spoken text: 「屌」.

Therefore, we add line 33.

Now, let's re-check:

- Line 8: has dialog (two parts)
- Line 27: dialog
- Line 29: dialog
- Line 33: has dialog (「屌」)
- Line 39: dialog
- Line 41: dialog (「！！！」)
- Line 46: dialog
- Line 48: dialog (「？？？」)
- Line 50: dialog

What about line 45? It's empty.

Line 44: 
44:
45:
46:「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」

So line 46 is the one with dialog.

Now, let's list all the lines we have:

8, 27, 29, 33, 39, 41, 46, 48, 50.

But wait, line 41: 
41:「！！！」 黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我。佢點都估唔到我認得呢把劍。原來係熔癌派人追殺我。

This line has the dialog 「！！！」 at the beginning.

Similarly, line 48: 
48:「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔，我忽然醒起熔癌唔識英文。

So we include.

Now, what about line 25? It doesn't have any quotes for dialog.

Line 26: empty.

Line 28: empty.

Line 30: empty.

Line 31: empty.

Line 32: empty.

Line 34: empty.

Line 35: ... no dialog in quotes.

Line 36: ... no.

Line 37: ... no.

Line 38: ... no.

Line 40: empty.

Line 42: empty.

Line 43: ... no dialog.

Line 44: empty.

Line 45: empty.

Line 47: empty.

Line 49: empty.

Line 51: empty.

Line 52: 【完】 -> not dialog.

So the lines we output are: 8, 27, 29, 33, 39, 41, 46, 48, 50.

Now, we output each matching line with its line number, and after each line of output, we output "---".

Format: 
<line number>:<line content>
---

Example: 
8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」
---

But note: the input has the line numbers as part of the input? Actually, the input we are given has the line numbers at the beginning of each line (like "1:# 呆總嘅老豆"). However, in the problem, it says: "For every line in the input, output the line (together with line number)".

But note: the input we are processing is the block from # START OF INPUT to # END OF INPUT, and each line in that block is prefixed by a number and a colon? Actually, no: the example input shows:

1:# 呆總嘅老豆
2:
3:

So the line numbers are part of the input string? Actually, the problem says: "output the line (together with line number)".

But in the input, the line numbers are already included as the first token (like "1:", "2:", etc.). However, the problem says: "output the line (together with line number)".

Wait, the problem states: "For every line in the input, output the line (together with line number)".

But note: the input we are given has the line numbers as part of the text? Actually, in the provided input, each line starts with a number and a colon. For example, line 1 is "1:# 呆總嘅老豆".

So when we output, we should output the entire line as it appears, including the line number prefix.

But the problem says: "output the line (together with line number)" — meaning we output the line number and then the content? Or the line as it is (which already has the line number)?

Looking at the input format: 
  1:# 呆總嘅老豆
  2:
  ...

So the line number is part of the string. Therefore, when we output a matching line, we output the entire string for that line (which includes the line number and the content).

But note: the problem says "together with line number", which might be redundant because the line number is already in the string. However, the input we are processing has the line numbers embedded.

So for line 8, the input string is: "8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」"

Therefore, we output exactly that string.

But note: the problem says "output the line (together with line number)" — so if the line number is already in the line, then we are outputting it.

So we just output the entire line as it appears in the input (with the line number prefix).

Therefore, for each matching line, we output:

<the entire line as given in the input>

and then "---"

Now, let's list the matching lines as they appear in the input:

Line 8: "8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」"

Line 27: "27:「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」"

Line 29: "29:「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。難怪我同佢對打可以力拔山河。平時我邊有咁大力？佢口裡強硬，卻一個翻身跳出牆外，似乎想逃走。"

Line 33: "33:我提劍急追，佢見我迫近，回身一劍，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕。"

Line 39: "39:「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 我抑壓心抵嘅震驚，若無其事咁問。"

Line 41: "41:「！！！」 黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我。佢點都估唔到我認得呢把劍。原來係熔癌派人追殺我。"

Line 46: "46:「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」"

Line 48: "48:「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔，我忽然醒起熔癌唔識英文。"

Line 50: "50:「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」"

Now, note: the input has the line numbers as part of the string, so we output exactly as above.

But wait, in the input, line 29 is written as:
29:「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。難怪我同佢對打可以力拔山河。平時我邊有咁大力？佢口裡強硬，卻一個翻身跳出牆外，似乎想逃走。

So we output that entire string.

Similarly for others.

Now, we output each of these lines, followed by "---".

Important: if no lines match, output empty. But we have matches.

Let's write the output:

8:「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」
---
27:「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」
---
29:「你做咁多傷天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。難怪我同佢對打可以力拔山河。平時我邊有咁大力？佢口裡強硬，卻一個翻身跳出牆外，似乎想逃走。
---
33:我提劍急追，佢見我迫近，回身一劍，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一聲，寶劍亂揮，斬中佢手腕。
---
39:「你係咪熔癌嘅人？！」 我抑壓心抵嘅震驚，若無其事咁問。
---
41:「！！！」 黑衣人驚訝嘅眼神已經回答咗我。佢點都估唔到我認得呢把劍。原來係熔癌派人追殺我。
---
46:「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」
---
48:「？？？」 佢一臉迷罔，我忽然醒起熔癌唔識英文。
---
50:「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」
---

But note: the problem says "after each line of output, also emit a "---" to separate it from your next output."

So each matching line is output, then "---", then the next matching line, then "---", etc.

However, note that the last one should also be followed by "---"? The problem says "after each line of output", meaning every matching line output is followed by "---". So even the last one.

But the example output format in the problem doesn't specify if the last one has a trailing "---", but it says "after each line of output", so we do it for every matching line.

Therefore, we output 9 lines of content and 9 separators.

Let me count: 9 matching lines -> 9 outputs of the line and then 9 "---".

But note: the problem says "after each line of output", meaning after the line content, so:

[content line 1]
---
[content line 2]
---
...

So we do that.

Now, write the output accordingly.
