Here are the answers to your questions:

**A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?**

No. Pure water freezes at **0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit)**. -12 degrees Celsius is *below* the freezing point, meaning it would be a solid (ice) *if* conditions are right.

**B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?**

The water will **freeze into ice**. However, it won't necessarily happen *immediately* at 0°C.  It needs to *release* heat to transition from liquid to solid. Once all the heat is removed and the temperature reaches 0°C, it will begin to freeze. Cooling it further to -12°C simply means the ice is now colder than its normal freezing point. It's a solid block of ice at that temperature.
