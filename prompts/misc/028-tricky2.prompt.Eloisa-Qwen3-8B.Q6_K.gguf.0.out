Okay, let's see. Alice says water freezes at -10°C, but Bob corrects her to 0°C. Then Bob says he's still right even after Alice's correction. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If Alice is wrong about the freezing point, then Bob is right. But Bob's statement that he's still right after Alice's correction is confusing. Maybe he's trying to say that despite Alice's initial mistake, he's correct. But the key point is the freezing point of water. Standard knowledge is that water freezes at 0°C under standard atmospheric pressure. So Bob is correct in stating that. Alice's initial statement is wrong, and her correction is right, but Bob's final assertion that he's still right might be a bit of a trick. But the main thing is that water freezes at 0°C, so Bob is right. The confusion might be in Bob's wording, but the fact remains that he's correct.

Bob is right. Water freezes at 0°C (32°F) under standard atmospheric pressure. Alice's initial statement that water freezes at -10°C is incorrect, and while her correction is accurate, Bob's assertion that he is still right refers to the correct freezing point of water. [end of text]
