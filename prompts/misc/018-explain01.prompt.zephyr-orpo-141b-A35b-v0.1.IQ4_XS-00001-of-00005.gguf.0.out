Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

(Verse 1)
Yo, let's talk about the Fed, they're the main bank in the hood,
The central bank for the country, making sure things are good.
They're in charge of the money supply, that's some real power,
Making sure inflation don't skyrocket every hour.

(Chorus)
Fed, Fed, they're the main bank in the hood,
Fed, Fed, making sure things are good.

(Verse 2)
They control the interest rates, that's some serious dough,
They're like the DJ of the economy, making sure it flows.
They got three main goals, listen up, here's the scoop,
Maintaining employment, stable prices, and moderate interest rates, that's the group.

(Chorus)
Fed, Fed, they're in charge of the money supply,
Fed, Fed, making sure inflation don't fly.

(Bridge)
They're independent, not controlled by the government,
Making their own decisions, that's how it's meant.
They got the power to print money, but they don't go wild,
They keep the economy stable, and that's why we're all smiled.

(Verse 3)
The Fed is the big boss, the OG in the game,
Controlling the money flow, that's their claim to fame.
They're the guardians of the economy, keeping it on track,
Making sure it's healthy, and that's a fact.

(Chorus)
Fed, Fed, they control the interest rates,
Fed, Fed, making sure the economy's great.</s>
