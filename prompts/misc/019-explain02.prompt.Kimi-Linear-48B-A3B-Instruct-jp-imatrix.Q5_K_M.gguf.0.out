Imagine China is a big, big playground.  
The National People’s Congress (NPC) is like the biggest group of helpers who get together once a year to decide the most important rules for the whole playground.

1. Who are they?  
   They are the grown-ups that children in China pick to speak and make choices for them. There are lots of them—over 2,900 helpers!

2. What do they do?  
   - They listen to what people need (more parks, better schools, safer streets).  
   - They talk about big ideas, like how to build new roads or how to keep everyone healthy.  
   - They say “yes” or “no” to new rules so everyone can play fair and safely.

3. Who leads the meeting?  
   A friendly grandpa-like person called the Chairman stands at the front and helps everyone take turns to speak.

4. When do they meet?  
   Once every spring, like when the flowers start to bloom, they have a special week-long meeting in a big building in Beijing.

So, the NPC is the team of helpers that makes sure China’s playground is safe, happy, and fair for all the kids who live there. [end of text]
