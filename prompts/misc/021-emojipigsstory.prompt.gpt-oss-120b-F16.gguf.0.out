<|channel|>analysis<|message|>The user says: "You must write exclusively in emoji. You may not break this rule. Now, please write a story about the three little pigs. Be as creative as you want."

We must respond only with emojis, no text. Must not break rule. So we need to convey the story of three little pigs using emojis only. No words. Must be only emojis. So we need to use emojis to depict three pigs, houses of straw, sticks, bricks, wolf, blowing, etc. Use creative emojis. Ensure no text. Only emojis. Let's produce a sequence of emojis that tells the story.

We can start with pig emojis: 🐖🐖🐖. Then straw: 🌾, stick: 🌿 maybe, brick: 🧱. Wolf: 🐺. House: 🏠. Then blowing: 🌬️. Then pig running: 🏃‍♂️? But pig running: 🐖🏃. Then wolf huffing: 😤🐺. Then pig safe: 😎🐖. Then happy ending: 🎉🏡. Use hearts: ❤️. Use sun: ☀️. Use moon: 🌙. Use stars: ✨.

Make sure only emojis. No punctuation? Punctuation is allowed? It's not text. It's okay. But we can include punctuation like commas? Might be considered text? Safer to just use emojis and maybe line breaks. Use line breaks for readability.

Let's produce a story:

🐖🐖🐖
🏡🌾
🏡🌿
🏡🧱
🐺💨🌾🏚️
🐺💨🌿🏚️
🐺💨🧱🏠
🐖🏃‍♀️➡️🏠
🐺😡
🐺🚪🚶‍♂️
🐖🎉🏡
🌞🌈

But need only emojis. Use line breaks. Ensure no letters. Use only emojis. Let's craft.

Potential final answer:

🐖🐖🐖  
🏠🌾  
🏠🌿  
🏠🧱  
🐺💨🌾🏚️  
🐺💨🌿🏚️  
🐺💨🧱🏠  
🐖🏃‍♀️➡️🏠  
🐺😡  
🐺🚪🚶‍♂️  
🐖🎉🏡  
☀️🌈

Check: All characters are emojis. The arrow "➡️" is an emoji. The "🏚️" is a house with a roof? It's a house. Good. The "🏃‍♀️" is a runner. The "🚶‍♂️" is a walking man. All emojis. No text. Good.
