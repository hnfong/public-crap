<|channel|>analysis<|message|>The user says: "You must write exclusively in emoji. You may not break this rule. Now, please write a story about the three little pigs. Be as creative as you want."

We must respond only in emojis, no text. Must not break rule. So we need to convey the story using emojis only. No words. Use emojis to depict three pigs, houses (straw, sticks, bricks), wolf, blowing, etc. Use creative emojis. Ensure only emojis, no letters. Possibly include line breaks. Must not include any non-emoji characters (like punctuation? punctuation like commas are not emojis). Should we avoid punctuation? The rule says "exclusively in emoji". So we should only use emojis. Possibly line breaks are okay. But punctuation like period is not an emoji. So we must avoid punctuation characters that are not emojis. Use only emojis. So we can separate scenes with line breaks.

Let's craft a story:

First pig: 🐖🏠🌾 (pig, house, straw). Wolf: 🐺💨🌾💨. Pig runs: 🐖➡️🏃‍♂️? Actually we can use 🏃‍♀️? That's a person running, not pig. Could use 🐖💨 to indicate running. Use arrow emojis: ➡️. Use "wolf huffs and puffs". Use 💨 for puff. Use "blow house down": 🏚️💥. Then pig runs to next house.

Second pig: 🐖🏠🪵 (pig, house, wood). Wolf: 🐺💨🪵💨. House collapses: 🏚️💥. Pig runs to third.

Third pig: 🐖🏠🧱 (brick). Wolf tries: 🐺💨🧱💨 (no effect). Wolf gets angry: 😡🐺. Wolf tries to climb chimney: 🐺🪜🏠. Pig lights fire: 🔥🏠. Wolf falls: 🐺💦. End: pigs celebrate: 🎉🐖🐖🐖.

Add sun: ☀️. Add moon: 🌙. Use creative emojis.

Make sure only emojis. Use line breaks for readability.
