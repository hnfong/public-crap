Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

   - The restaurant is located deep in the forest, and it's not easy to find. Even if you follow acorns (ドングリ), you won't reach it.
   - The restaurant has an empty pocket (空っぽのポケット), suggesting it's a place where material possessions are not important.
   - The restaurant is empty, with no reservations (予約は一つもありません) and plenty of empty seats (空席だらけ) during lunchtime.
   - Small birds are fluttering and laughing, adding to the playful and whimsical atmosphere.

2. **The Restaurant's Appearance and Ambiance:**
   - The restaurant has a bright red tin roof (真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根), making it stand out in the forest.
   - The menu is simple, with only a few recommended dishes (メニューはおすすめ そればかり).
   - From the kitchen, you can hear the sounds of a violin, flute, cello, and viola (バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ), suggesting a musical and artistic environment.

3. **The Welcoming and Mysterious Host:**
   - The host welcomes guests warmly (ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい) and invites them to eat their fill and then take a nap (たらふく食べたらお眠りよ).
   - The host bids farewell to the guests (それでは皆さんさようなら) and suggests that each day is unique (明日は明日で エトセトラ).

4. **The Enchanted Atmosphere:**
   - The scene shifts to a chaotic and lively one, with a small bear dancing (手乗りの子熊も踊り出す).

The host is welcoming and mysterious, and the atmosphere is filled with music and playful creatures. The menu is simple but satisfying, and the service extends beyond the ordinary, even to the grave.
