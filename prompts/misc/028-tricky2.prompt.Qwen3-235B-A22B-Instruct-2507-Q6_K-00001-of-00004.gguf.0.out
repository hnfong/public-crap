Alice is correct in saying that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. That is the well-established freezing point of pure water.

Bob is incorrect in claiming that water freezes at -10°C. However, he might be misunderstanding the statement. While water *can* remain liquid below 0°C in certain conditions (like supercooling), it does not *freeze* at -10°C — it freezes *at* 0°C, and once frozen, ice remains solid at -10°C.

So, Bob is wrong to say "water freezes at -10°C." He may have meant that water *is frozen* at -10°C, which would be correct, but that's different from saying it *freezes at* that temperature.

Therefore, **Alice is right**, and **Bob is wrong** — he is not "still right." [end of text]
