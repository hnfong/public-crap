Bob is right in a sense, but Alice is also correct in stating the standard freezing point. Water at –10 °C will certainly be frozen (solid ice) if it’s pure water at normal pressure, because it’s below its freezing point of 0 °C. So Bob’s statement “It freezes” is true for water that is at –10 °C. Alice’s correction about the freezing point (0 °C) is also true, but it doesn’t contradict Bob’s claim—once the temperature has dropped to –10 °C the water has already passed that threshold and is indeed frozen. So both are right: the water is frozen at –10 °C, and the freezing point is 0 °C. The apparent disagreement is just a matter of timing: Bob is describing the state at –10 °C, while Alice is describing the temperature at which freezing begins. [end of text]
