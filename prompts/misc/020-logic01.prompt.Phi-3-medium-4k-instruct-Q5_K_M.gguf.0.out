If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

In the realm of logic and mathematics, a theory that proves itself can often be described as "tautological." Tautology, in logic, refers to a statement that is true in every possible interpretation, and it is essentially equivalent to its own proof. This differs from the term "consistent," which is used to describe a set of statements that do not contain any contradictions.


A theory that proves itself is essentially saying that "if the theory is true, then it is true," which is a tautology. Here's an example:


1. Axiomatic systems: In an axiomatic system, the axioms are taken as self-evident truths. If the system is able to derive its axioms as theorems, then it is considered to be tautological in nature, as it is proving its own starting points. An example of such a system is Euclidean geometry, where Euclid's axioms were used to prove many theorems within the system, including some axioms themselves.


2. Logical frameworks: In some logical frameworks, like propositional logic, there are tautologies like "P or not P" (Law of Excluded Middle). This is a statement that is true in any possible situation, and its truth is self-evident within the logical framework.


It is essential to differentiate between tautology and consistency. A theory can be tautological without being consistent if it contains contradictory axioms; however, a tautology by its very nature cannot be inconsistent.<|end|>
