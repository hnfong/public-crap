Imagine you and all your friends at school want to decide what game to play at break time.

Usually, your teacher tells you the rules, right? But in this special game, **you and your friends** get to write the rulebook.

**China’s National People’s Congress is like a giant meeting for the whole country.**

Here is how it works:

1.  **The Big Group:** Imagine a hall so big it holds nearly 3,000 people. That’s like filling up a huge football stadium with people! These people come from all over China—doctors, farmers, soldiers, and teachers.
2.  **Making the Rules:** Their job is to sit down together and decide the most important rules for the country. They decide things like, "What holidays should we have?" or "How should we protect the rivers?"
3.  **The Bosses:** They also pick the "Big Bosses" (like the President and the judges) who have to run the country every day.

So, simply put: They are the giant team that writes the rulebook for China! [end of text]
