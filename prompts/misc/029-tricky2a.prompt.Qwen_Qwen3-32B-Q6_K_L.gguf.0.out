Both Alice and Bob are **partially right**, but **Bob's statement is incomplete**.

- **Alice is correct** that **pure water freezes at 0째C** under standard conditions.
- **Bob is also correct** in saying that **water freezes at -10째C**, but **only if the water is impure or supercooled**, or if it's under **non-standard conditions**. For example:
  - **Supercooled water** can remain liquid below 0째C, but it will freeze when disturbed.
  - **Impure water** (like saltwater) has a **lower freezing point** than 0째C due to **freezing point depression**.

So, **Bob is right in context**, but **Alice is right in the standard case**. The correct answer depends on the specific conditions. [end of text]
