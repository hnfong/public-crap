Hmm, the user has provided Japanese lyrics with a lighthearted, mischievous tone and asks for a story interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting. The lyrics mention a forest restaurant, empty pockets, forgotten people, musical instruments, and surreal elements like sleeping after eating and a "final full course" reaching graves. 

The key is to avoid metaphorical readings and stick to a literal fantastical narrative. The restaurant seems to exist outside normal logic—no reservations, always empty seats, yet welcoming. The "forgotten person" clue suggests it’s for those who’ve been forgotten by the world. The musical kitchen and dancing bear reinforce the whimsical, otherworldly vibe. The ending about delivering food to graves ties it to the afterlife or a liminal space. 

I can construct a story where the restaurant is a purgatory-like haven for forgotten souls, serving as a final feast before moving on. The mischievous tone comes from the absurd yet cozy details—like the bear dancing or the menu being only "recommended" dishes. The "no dessert" and "final full course" hint at closure. 

The user likely wants a coherent, literal plot, not just poetic analysis. So I’ll frame it as a ghostly diner where the lost gather, with the staff as spectral musicians and the bear as a spirit guide. The "empty pockets" might mean they have no worldly possessions, and "forgotten people" are literally those no one remembers. The "sleep after eating" could be a euphemism for passing on. 

I’ll avoid over-explaining metaphors and focus on the narrative logic: a restaurant that exists between worlds, serving as a last stop for forgotten souls, with a playful yet eerie atmosphere. The mischievous tone comes from the contrast between the cheerful setting and its grim purpose.

Based on a literal reading within a fantastical setting, here is the story the lyrics tell:

The song describes **a mysterious, hidden restaurant that exists in a magical forest, which serves as a final, celebratory stop for people who have been forgotten by the living world.**

**The Story:**

1.  **The Unfindable Location:** You cannot find this restaurant by following ordinary paths ("Even if you follow the acorn, you won't arrive"). It only appears to those it's meant for. It's a "small restaurant in the forest" with a bright red tin roof.

2.  **The Clientele:** The patrons are specifically "people who have been forgotten." They arrive not by reservation, but by a kind of spiritual or magical pull from their past. They come with "empty pockets"—they have no worldly possessions or status left. The restaurant is always full of "empty seats" at lunchtime, meaning it's perpetually ready for its specific guests, even if it seems empty to an outsider. A little bird laughs ("Pata pata") at this paradox.

3.  **The Ambiance & Service:** The kitchen is filled with the sound of string instruments (violin, flute, cello, viola), suggesting the staff are musicians or the food itself is musical. The welcome is hearty but ominous: "Eat your fill, then you will sleep. Well then, everyone, goodbye. Tomorrow is another day, et cetera." This implies a permanent, gentle departure after the meal.

4.  **The Menu & The Feast:** The menu is only "recommended" dishes—there is no choice. The listed foods (carpaccio, paella, hors d'oeuvres, risotto) are a surreal, luxurious mix from various cuisines, emphasizing the fantastical nature. Crucially, **"There is no dessert."** This is a key detail. The meal is a complete, final experience.

5.  **The Climax & Purpose:** The true nature is revealed in the last two lines:
    *   **"Let's deliver it all the way inside the grave" (お墓の中まで届けましょう):** The food is not just for consumption; it is a ceremonial offering or a final meal to be taken *into* the grave.
    *   **"Tonight is the final full course" (今宵は最後のフルコース):** This confirms the entire experience is a "full course" meal—the last one the guest will ever have.

6.  **The Mischievous Tone:** The lighthearted, silly elements (the dancing bear on someone's shoulder, the bird laughing, the chaotic "right to left" hustle) contrast with the grim finality. This creates a mischievous, whimsical atmosphere around a solemn, supernatural event. It's a cheerful wake, a playful funeral feast.

**Literal Fantastical Interpretation:**
The restaurant is a **spirit-way station or a purgatorial diner**. It manifests for souls who have no living mourners or memory ("forgotten people"). They are magically summoned for one last, joyous, surreal party—a "final full course"—before their essence is delivered ("delivered") into their grave or whatever comes next. The staff are likely other spirits or fae, serving a meal that is both a celebration of life and a send-off. The "sleep" after eating is a euphemism for final rest. The mischievous tone reflects the spirits' perspective: for them, this is a regular, cheerful job, even if it's the end for their guests.

It's not a metaphor for death; it's a literal depiction of a magical process for forgotten souls, framed with playful absurdity. [end of text]
