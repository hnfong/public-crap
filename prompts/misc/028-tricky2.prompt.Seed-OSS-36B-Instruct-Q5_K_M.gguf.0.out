Got it, let's try to figure this out. The question is about whether Bob is right when he says water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius, even though Alice corrects him by saying it's 0 degrees. First, I need to remember the normal freezing point of water. At standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere), water freezes at 0°C, right? That's the usual point we learn.

But Bob says he's still right, so maybe there's a condition where water can freeze at -10°C. What affects the freezing point of water? Oh, right, pressure and purity. If the pressure is lower than standard, the freezing point might change? Wait, actually, for most substances, increasing pressure raises the freezing point, but water is unusual because it expands when it freezes, so increasing pressure lowers the freezing point. Wait, let me confirm that: water's freezing point decreases as pressure increases? Or is it the other way around? Let's think: when you apply pressure to ice, it melts because ice is less dense than water, so pressure favors the denser phase (liquid). Therefore, to make ice freeze at a lower temperature, you might need lower pressure? Wait, no, let's use the phase diagram of water. The phase diagram has pressure on the y-axis and temperature on the x-axis. The normal freezing point is at 1 atm (standard pressure) and 0°C. If you go along the line where solid and liquid are in equilibrium (the fusion curve), as pressure increases, the freezing point (temperature where solid and liquid coexist) decreases slightly. Wait, actually, the fusion curve for water has a negative slope, meaning that increasing pressure lowers the freezing temperature. So at very high pressures, water can stay liquid below 0°C, but if pressure is lower than 1 atm, does the freezing point increase or decrease? Let's see: at 1 atm, 0°C. If pressure is lower, say 0.5 atm, what's the freezing point? From the phase diagram, the fusion curve goes from the triple point (0.01°C, 611.657 Pa) upwards to the left. So below the triple point pressure, there's no liquid water; it goes directly from solid to gas (sublimation). So above triple point pressure but below 1 atm, the freezing point is actually slightly higher than 0°C? Wait, no, let's get the numbers right. The triple point is 0.01°C, so at 1 atm, which is higher than triple point pressure, the freezing point is 0°C, which is slightly lower than triple point temperature. So as pressure increases from triple point to 1 atm, temperature decreases from 0.01°C to 0°C. So yes, higher pressure lowers the freezing point of water relative to 0°C.

But maybe another factor is purity. If water has impurities, like salt, the freezing point decreases (freezing point depression). For example, salt water freezes at a lower temperature than pure water. But Bob didn't mention salt, though. Alternatively, maybe supercooling? Supercooling is when a liquid is cooled below its freezing point without freezing. So pure water can be supercooled to below 0°C, like -10°C, and still be liquid, but if you disturb it, it freezes. But does that mean it "freezes at -10°C"? No, the freezing point is still 0°C; supercooling is just a metastable state.

Wait, but Bob says "water freezes at -10 degrees celsius." Maybe he's referring to a different pressure? For example, if the pressure is extremely high, can water freeze at -10°C? Let's check: the slope of the fusion curve is about -1.8°C per 100 atm (since the Clausius-Clapeyron equation for fusion: dP/dT = L/(TΔV), where ΔV is positive for water (ice is less dense), so dP/dT is negative). So to lower the freezing point by 10°C, how much pressure do we need? From 0°C to -10°C is a 10°C change, so ΔT = -10°C, so ΔP = (dP/dT)*ΔT. If dP/dT is approximately -1.8°C/100 atm, then ΔP = (-1.8°C/100 atm)*(-10°C) = 0.18 atm? Wait, that can't be right, maybe I mixed up the sign. Let's do it properly: dT/dP = ΔV*T/L. For water, L (latent heat of fusion) is 334 kJ/kg, ΔV = V_ice - V_liquid = (1/0.9168 - 1/1) m³/kg ≈ 0.090 m³/kg, T = 273 K. So dT/dP = (0.090 m³/kg * 273 K) / 334000 J/kg ≈ (24.57) / 334000 ≈ 7.36e-5 K/Pa ≈ 7.36e-2 K/atm (since 1 atm ≈ 101325 Pa). So dT/dP ≈ -0.0736 K/atm (negative because slope is negative). So to get T = -10°C = 263 K, ΔT = 263 - 273 = -10 K. So ΔP = ΔT / (dT/dP) ≈ (-10 K) / (-0.0736 K/atm) ≈ 136 atm. So at about 136 atm pressure, water freezes at -10°C. So if the pressure is 136 atm, then the freezing point is -10°C. So in that case, water does freeze at -10°C under high pressure.

Is that a valid case? The question is, when someone says "water freezes at -10 degrees celsius," do they mean at standard pressure? Usually, when we say "freezes at 0°C," we mean standard pressure (1 atm). But if the conditions are different (pressure), then the freezing point changes. So Bob might be referring to non-standard pressure. Alice is correct that at standard pressure, it's 0°C, but Bob is also correct that under certain conditions (like high pressure), water can freeze at -10°C.

Another possibility: maybe Bob is confused, but the key is that the freezing point is not fixed unless pressure is specified. The normal freezing point is 0°C at 1 atm, but the freezing point depends on pressure. So both could be right depending on context. Alice states the normal freezing point, which is correct, but Bob is also right because there are conditions where water freezes at -10°C.

Wait, but does "water freezes at X degrees" implicitly mean at standard pressure? In common language, yes, but in science, if you don't specify pressure, it's sometimes assumed, but technically, phase transitions depend on pressure. So the answer is that both are partially right, but Bob is correct in the sense that water can freeze at -10°C under certain pressures (higher than atmospheric), while Alice is correct about the standard freezing point. But the question is "Who is right? Explain briefly." So maybe Bob is right because he's considering that freezing point isn't absolute; it depends on pressure. Alice is right about the common case, but Bob is also right because there are cases where it freezes at -10°C.

Wait, let me check again. At standard pressure (1 atm), water freezes at 0°C. If you increase pressure, the freezing point decreases. So at higher pressure, water freezes at a lower temperature. So yes, at sufficiently high pressure, water can freeze at -10°C. Therefore, Bob is correct that water freezes at -10°C (under high pressure), and Alice is correct that the normal freezing point is 0°C. But the question is who is right. Since Bob says "I'm still right," he must be invoking a condition where that's true. So the answer is that both are correct in different contexts, but if we have to say who is right, probably Bob is right because he's acknowledging that the freezing point can vary, while Alice is only stating the standard case. Wait, no—Alice is correct about the standard freezing point, but Bob is also correct that there are non-standard conditions where it freezes at -10°C. So the question is, does "what happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" imply standard pressure? If so, then at -10°C and 1 atm, water is frozen (ice), right? Wait, no: at 1 atm, water freezes at 0°C, so below 0°C, it's ice. So at -10°C and 1 atm, water is already frozen. So if Alice asks "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" the answer could be "It is frozen" (since it freezes at 0°C, so below that it's solid). But Bob says "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius," which is a statement about the freezing point, not the state at -10°C. So Alice corrects him by saying the freezing point is 0°C, but Bob says he's still right. So maybe Bob is misinterpreting the question: Alice asks "what happens to water at -10°C"—if you take water (liquid) and cool it to -10°C, what happens? At standard pressure, it would have frozen at 0°C, so at -10°C it's ice. But maybe if you cool it very quickly without nucleation sites, it supercools to -10°C and then freezes? But that's still freezing at -10°C in that case? No, supercooling is when it doesn't freeze until below the freezing point, so the actual freezing point is still 0°C, but the freezing event happens at -10°C. So is the "freezing point" the temperature at which it transitions, or the temperature at which it actually freezes when cooled?

In thermodynamics, the freezing point is the temperature at which liquid and solid are in equilibrium at a given pressure. So that's 0°C at 1 atm. But if you have supercooled water, it's not in equilibrium; it's a metastable liquid. When it finally freezes, it's because it's nucleating, but the equilibrium freezing point is still 0°C. However, in common language, people might say "it froze at -10°C" if that's the temperature when it actually turned solid, even if it's supercooled.

Alternatively, pressure: as we saw, at high pressure, the equilibrium freezing point is lower. So if you have water at high pressure, say 136 atm, then its freezing point is -10°C, so when you cool it to -10°C, it freezes. So in that case, Bob is correct that water freezes at -10°C (at that pressure).

So the key point is that the freezing point of water is not constant; it depends on pressure (and solutes). At standard pressure, it's 0°C, but under other conditions, it can be different. Therefore, Alice is correct about the standard freezing point, but Bob is also correct because there exist conditions (e.g., high pressure) where water freezes at -10°C. Since Bob says "I'm still right," he's probably referring to these non-standard conditions, so both are right, but maybe the question expects that Bob is right because freezing point depends on pressure, so Alice only stated the normal case, while Bob is correct that it can freeze at -10°C under other conditions.</seed:think>Both Alice and Bob are partially correct, but Bob’s assertion holds under specific conditions, making him "still right" in a broader scientific context:


### **Alice’s Correctness**:  
At **standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm)**, the normal freezing point of pure water is 0°C. This is the common, everyday scenario most people reference, so Alice is correct about the typical freezing point.


### **Bob’s Correctness**:  
The freezing point of water is not fixed—it depends on **pressure** (and solute concentration). For water, which expands when freezing, increasing pressure lowers the freezing point (unlike most substances). By the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, at sufficiently high pressure (≈136 atm, calculated from phase diagram trends), the equilibrium freezing point of water drops to -10°C.  

Thus, **under high pressure**, water *does* freeze at -10°C. Bob is right to argue that his statement holds in non-standard conditions.


### **Conclusion**:  
Alice is correct for the standard case, but Bob is also correct because the freezing point of water is pressure-dependent. Since Bob acknowledges contexts beyond standard pressure, he is "still right."


**Answer**: Bob is right because the freezing point of water depends on pressure; at high pressure (≈136 atm), water freezes at -10°C. Alice correctly states the standard freezing point (0°C at 1 atm), but Bob’s claim holds under non-standard conditions. [end of text]
