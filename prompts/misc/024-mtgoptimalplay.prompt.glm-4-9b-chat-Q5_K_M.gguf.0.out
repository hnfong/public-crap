In this scenario, Alice is facing a creature that can potentially block her burn spells, and she has a burn strategy with two copies of the instant 'Kindle'. Bob has an untapped Orim, Samite Healer, which has a tap ability that prevents the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn. Here's the optimal play for both players:

**Alice's Optimal Play:**

Alice's goal is to deal damage to Orim without triggering the "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage" ability. Since Alice has two copies of Kindle, she can deal 6 damage to Orim with one Kindle and then another 6 damage with the second Kindle. However, if she casts both Kindles in the same turn, Bob can tap Orim before the second Kindle resolves, preventing the damage from the second cast.

To avoid this, Alice should cast the first Kindle and then wait for Bob to untap Orim. Once Bob untaps Orim, Alice can cast the second Kindle. This way, the first Kindle will deal 6 damage, and the second Kindle will deal another 6 damage, totaling 12 damage to Orim before Bob can tap Orim again to prevent any more damage.

**Bob's Optimal Play:**

Bob's goal is to prevent Alice from dealing enough damage to kill Orim. Since Orim is untapped, Bob can tap it before Alice casts the second Kindle. This will prevent the damage from the second Kindle from being dealt, as the "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage" ability will be active.

However, if Alice casts the second Kindle after Bob untaps Orim, Bob can't tap Orim again to prevent the damage from the second cast because the ability has already been used. So, Bob should wait for Alice to cast the first Kindle and then untap Orim immediately after it resolves. This will allow Bob to tap Orim again before Alice casts the second Kindle, preventing the damage from the second cast.

**Outcome:**

If Alice follows her optimal play, she will deal 6 damage to Orim with the first Kindle. Bob will untap Orim immediately after the first Kindle resolves, preventing any damage from the second Kindle. Alice will then have to decide whether to cast another spell or wait for her next turn to deal more damage.

If Bob follows his optimal play, he will untap Orim after the first Kindle resolves, preventing any damage from the second Kindle. Alice will then have to decide whether to cast another spell or wait for her next turn to deal more damage.

In this situation, the optimal play for both players is to wait and see what the other player does before making a move. Alice should cast the first Kindle and then wait for Bob to untap Orim before casting the second Kindle. Bob should untap Orim immediately after the first Kindle resolves to prevent any damage from the second cast. [end of text]
