The Linux command you've provided is a pipeline of several commands that process the content of `wowfanfic.txt`. Let's break down the command and understand what it does:

1. `cat wowfanfic.txt`: This command reads the contents of `wowfanfic.txt` and outputs it to the standard output (usually the terminal).

2. `|`: This is a pipe symbol. It takes the output of the command on its left and uses it as the input for the command on its right.

3. `perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'`: This is a Perl one-liner. Here's what it does:
   - `-ne`: This tells Perl to execute the script for each line of input (`-n`), and to enable automatic `$_` variable (`-e`).
   - `@a = split(/\s/);`: This splits the line into an array `@a` based on whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines).
   - `foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }`: This iterates over each element in `@a` and prints it followed by a newline. This essentially prints each word on a new line.

4. `sort`: This sorts the output alphabetically.

5. `uniq -c`: This counts the occurrences of each unique line. The `-c` option tells `uniq` to prefix each line with the count of occurrences.

6. `sort -n`: This sorts the output numerically based on the counts.

7. `tail -n 20`: This takes the last 20 lines of the sorted output.

Now, let's consider the linguistic principles involved:

- **Tokenization**: The Perl command splits the text into tokens (words) based on whitespace. This is a fundamental step in text analysis.

- **Frequency Distribution**: The `sort | uniq -c` part of the pipeline creates a frequency distribution of the words. This is a common method in linguistics to analyze the distribution of words in a text.

- **Sorting**: Sorting the output by frequency (`sort -n`) is a way to identify the most and least common words, which can be useful for various linguistic analyses, such as identifying the most common nouns, verbs, etc.

- **Limiting Output**: `tail -n 20` limits the output to the 20 most frequent words, which is often done to focus on the most significant linguistic features.

The probable output of the command would be a list of the 20 most frequently occurring words in `wowfanfic.txt`, each preceded by its count. This output would give you an idea of the most common words in the fan fiction text, which could be useful for understanding the text's vocabulary, style, or even for linguistic analysis. For example, if "Anduin" and "Gul'dan" are common names in the fan fiction, they might appear frequently in the output. If "the", "and", "of" are common articles and prepositions, they would likely appear at the top of the list as well. [end of text]
