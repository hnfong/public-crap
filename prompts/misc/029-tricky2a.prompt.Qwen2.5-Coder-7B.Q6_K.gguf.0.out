Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, not -10 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is a well-known physical property that is independent of temperature. The statement "It freezes" is true, but it does not specify the temperature at which it freezes. Therefore, Alice's statement that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius is more specific and accurate.
