ASSISTANT: 👸🏻✨ Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away, there lived a beautiful girl named Snow White. 🏰✨ Her skin was as white as snow, her lips as red as a rose, and her hair as black as a raven's wing. 👧🏻❄️🌹👑

Snow White's stepmother, the Queen, was very jealous of her beauty. 👑😾 She consulted her Magic Mirror every day, asking, "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?" 🪞🗣️ When the mirror answered, "Snow White," the Queen's heart filled with envy. 😡👸🏻

The Queen ordered a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. 🗡️👮‍♂️🌲 But the huntsman couldn't bring himself to harm the innocent girl. He let her go, and Snow White found herself alone in the deep, dark woods. 🌲👣👧🏻

Snow White stumbled upon a cozy cottage belonging to seven dwarfs. 🏠👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👑 She tidied up the place and fell asleep in one of the tiny beds. 🛌🧹 When the dwarfs returned, they were surprised to find her, but they decided to let her stay because she was kind and helpful. 👵🏻👍

The Queen learned from her mirror that Snow White was still alive and living with the dwarfs. Disguising herself as an old peddler woman, she visited the cottage with a poisoned apple. 🍎👩‍🦳🎭 Snow White, not knowing it was a trap, took a bite and fell into a deep sleep. 😴👸🏻

The dwarfs found Snow White and, thinking she was dead, placed her in a glass coffin. ⚰️💔 Years passed, and a prince riding through the forest came upon the sleeping beauty. He fell in love with her at once and kissed her gently. 💋👑

The kiss broke the spell, and Snow White awoke. ✨👩‍❤️‍👨 She and the prince were married, and the Queen, who had come to the wedding to try and harm Snow White once more, was defeated by the prince's knights. 👰🏻🤵🎊

Snow White and the prince lived happily ever after, and the dwarfs continued to mine for jewels and live happily in their forest home. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦🏰💍 And the Magic Mirror forever reflected the truth, that Snow White was the fairest of them all. 🪞✨👸🏻
