👸🏻✨ Once upon a time, in a kingdom far, far away, there lived a beautiful girl named Snow White. 🏰✨ Her skin was as white as snow, her lips as red as a rose, and her hair as black as a raven's wing. 👧🏻❄️🌹👑

Snow White's stepmother, the Queen, was very jealous of her beauty. 👑😾 She consulted her Magic Mirror every day, asking, "Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?" 🪞🗣️ When the mirror answered, "Snow White," the Queen's heart filled with envy. 😡👸🏻

The Queen ordered a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. 🗡️👮‍♂️🌲 But the huntsman couldn't bring himself to harm the innocent girl. He let her go, and Snow White found herself alone in the deep, dark woods. 🌲👣👧🏻

Snow White stumbled upon a cozy cottage belonging to seven dwarfs. 🏠👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👑 She tidied up the place and fell asleep in one of the tiny beds. 🛌🧹 When the dwarfs returned, they were surprised to find her, but they decided to let her stay because she was kind and helpful. 👵🏻👍

The Queen learned from her mirror that Snow White was still alive and living with the dwarfs. Disguising herself as an old peddler woman, she visited the cottage with a poisoned apple. 🍎👩‍🦳🎭 Snow White, not knowing it was a trap, took a bite and fell into a deep sleep. 😴👸🏻

The dwarfs found Snow White and, thinking she was dead, placed her in a glass coffin. ⚰️💔 Years passed, and a prince riding through the forest came upon the sleeping beauty. He fell in love with her and kissed her, breaking the spell. 💋✨

Snow White awoke, and the prince declared his love for her. They planned to marry and live happily ever after. 👰🏻🤵💒 The evil Queen attended the wedding, not knowing it was Snow White's. When she saw the bride, her heart filled with rage. 😡👰🏻

As punishment for her wickedness, the Queen was forced to dance in red-hot iron shoes until she dropped dead. 👠🔥💀 Snow White and the prince lived many joyous years together, ruling the kingdom with kindness and love. 👑❤️👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 And they all lived happily ever after. 🎊🎉👨‍👩‍👧‍👦✨ The end.
