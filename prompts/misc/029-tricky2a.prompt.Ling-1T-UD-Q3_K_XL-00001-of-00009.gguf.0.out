Both Alice and Bob can be considered right, depending on interpretation:

- **Alice** is correct that **pure water freezes at 0°C** under standard conditions.
- **Bob** is also right in a practical sense: **at -10°C, water is frozen**, so it "freezes" (i.e., is in a frozen state).

So:
- Alice is right about the **freezing point**.
- Bob is right that **at -10°C, water is frozen**.

Thus, both statements are correct in context. [end of text]
