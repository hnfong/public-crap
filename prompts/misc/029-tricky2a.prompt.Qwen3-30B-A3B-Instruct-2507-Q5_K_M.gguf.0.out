Bob is correct in a broader scientific context.

While pure water typically freezes at 0°C under standard atmospheric pressure, water can remain in a liquid state below 0°C in a phenomenon called **supercooling**. At -10°C, water *can* still be liquid if it's very pure and lacks nucleation sites (like dust or impurities) to start freezing.

However, if water *is* at -10°C, it is **not** in its liquid state—it has already frozen (or would have frozen). So Bob's statement "It freezes" is accurate in the sense that water *will* freeze at -10°C if it hasn't already, and it *cannot* remain liquid indefinitely at that temperature under normal conditions.

Thus, Bob is right: water at -10°C is frozen (or would freeze), so saying "it freezes" is correct. Alice is technically correct that water *freezes at 0°C*, but Bob is right in context—water at -10°C is not liquid, so it has already frozen. [end of text]
