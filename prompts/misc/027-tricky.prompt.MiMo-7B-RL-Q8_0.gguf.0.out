Okay, let's tackle these questions. 

Starting with part A: Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius? Hmm, I remember that the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius under normal atmospheric pressure. Freezing happens when the temperature reaches 0°C, right? So if the temperature is lower than that, like -12°C, the water should still freeze, but maybe faster? Wait, but actually, once it freezes at 0°C, it stays frozen even if the temperature drops below that. So even at -12°C, water would freeze, but the freezing process would start at 0°C. So the answer is yes, it does freeze at -12°C because freezing occurs at 0°C and below.

Now part B: If you have a glass of pure water cooled to -12°C, what happens? Well, at -12°C, which is below freezing, the water should freeze. But wait, when you cool it, it first reaches 0°C and then freezes. So when you cool it to -12°C, the water would have already turned into ice at 0°C. So the glass would contain ice, and maybe some slush if it's not supercooled. But pure water at -12°C would just be ice. Wait, but sometimes you can have supercooling where water remains liquid below 0°C, but that's under specific conditions without nucleation sites. But in a glass, there might be impurities or surfaces that promote freezing. So in reality, when you cool pure water to below 0°C, it would start freezing at 0°C, so by the time it reaches -12°C, it's already ice. So the glass would have ice, and the temperature would stay at 0°C until all the water is frozen. Wait, no. Actually, once it freezes, the temperature can drop below 0°C as the ice gets colder. But the freezing point is 0°C. So maybe the ice would just be at -12°C, but ice can exist at lower temperatures. So the answer would be that the water freezes into ice at 0°C, and then the temperature can decrease further to -12°C, but the ice remains solid. So the glass would contain ice, and the temperature would be -12°C. But wait, when you cool the water, once it's frozen, the ice can be cooled below 0°C. So the process would be: water at room temp cooled to 0°C, freezes into ice, then cooled further to -12°C. So the result is ice at -12°C. But maybe the question is more about whether it freezes at -12°C. So part B's answer is that the water freezes at 0°C first, then the ice cools down to -12°C. So the glass would contain ice, and the temperature would be -12°C. But the actual freezing occurs at 0°C. So the answer would be that the water freezes at 0°C, and then the ice is cooled to -12°C. So the glass would have ice, and the temperature would reach -12°C. But maybe the user is asking, if you cool it directly to -12°C without going through 0°C. But in reality, you can't cool liquid water below 0°C without it freezing first. So when you cool the glass to -12°C, the water would freeze at 0°C, and then the ice would cool down to -12°C. So the result is ice at -12°C. 

Wait, but maybe the question is testing the understanding that below 0°C, water freezes, so cooling to -12°C would cause it to freeze. So part B's answer is that the water freezes into ice at 0°C, and then the temperature can drop to -12°C, resulting in ice at that temperature. So the glass would contain ice, and the temperature would be -12°C. But perhaps the key point is that when cooled below 0°C, the water freezes, so at -12°C, it's ice. 

So summarizing:

A) Yes, water freezes at 0°C and below, so at -12°C it freezes.

B) The water would freeze into ice at 0°C, then cool to -12°C, resulting in ice at that temperature. But maybe the answer is simply that it freezes into ice, as the temperature is below freezing. But perhaps more precise: when cooled to -12°C, the water freezes at 0°C first, then the ice is cooled further. So the glass would contain ice, and the temperature would be -12°C. But maybe the answer is that the water freezes into ice, and the temperature remains at 0°C until all water is frozen. Wait, no. Once it's frozen, the ice can be cooled below 0°C. So the process is: cooling the liquid water to 0°C, it freezes (turns to ice), and then as you continue cooling, the ice temperature drops to -12°C. So the glass would have ice at -12°C. 

So the answers would be:

A) Yes, because freezing occurs at 0°C and below.

B) The water freezes into ice at 0°C, then the ice cools down to -12°C. So the glass contains ice at -12°C. But maybe the answer is simpler: the water freezes into ice. Because once it's frozen, the temperature can be lower. But the key point is that at -12°C, the water would be frozen. So the answer to B is that the water freezes into ice, and the temperature would be -12°C. But perhaps the user expects that when you cool pure water to -12°C, it remains liquid until it reaches 0°C, then freezes. But actually, pure water in a pure environment might remain liquid supercooled, but in practice, with impurities or nucleation sites, it freezes at 0°C. Since it's pure water, maybe in a very clean glass, it could supercool. But generally, in reality, it would freeze at 0°C. So the answer might be that the water freezes into ice at 0°C, and then the ice is cooled to -12°C. So the glass would have ice at -12°C. 

But perhaps the answer is straightforward: A) Yes, because freezing happens at 0°C and below. B) The water freezes into ice at 0°C, and then the temperature can drop to -12°C, resulting in ice at that temperature. Or maybe B) The water freezes into ice, as the temperature is below 0°C. 

Wait, the question says "what happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?" So when you cool it to -12°C, but during cooling, once it reaches 0°C, it freezes. So the process would be: the water cools to 0°C, freezes, and then the temperature can be lowered further to -12°C. So the result is ice at -12°C. So the answer is that the water freezes into ice at 0°C, and then the ice cools to -12°C. But maybe the answer is simply that the water freezes into ice. Because once it's frozen, the temperature can be lower. But the key point is that cooling to -12°C causes it to freeze. 

Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the water would freeze at 0°C, and the glass would contain ice. The temperature would then be 0°C until all the water is frozen, and then it can be cooled further. But the question says cooled down to -12°C. So perhaps the answer is that the water freezes at 0°C, and then the ice is cooled to -12°C. So the glass would have ice at -12°C. 

But perhaps the answer is more straightforward. For part B, since the temperature is below freezing, the water freezes. So the answer is that the water freezes into ice. But the exact process might involve the freezing happening at 0°C first. 

But maybe the user expects the answer to be: A) Yes, because the freezing point of water is 0°C, so at -12°C, it freezes. B) The water freezes into ice. 

Yes, that's probably the intended answer. Because the freezing occurs at 0°C, but any temperature below that will still have the water frozen. So even at -12°C, the water is frozen. So part B's answer is that the water freezes into ice. 

Wait, but when you cool the water, it first reaches 0°C, freezes, and then the temperature can drop below 0°C. So the ice is at -12°C. But the question is asking what happens when you cool it to -12°C. So the result is that the water freezes (at 0°C) and then the ice is cooled to -12°C. So the glass contains ice at -12°C. 

But maybe the answer is simply that the water freezes into ice. Because once it's frozen, the temperature can be lower. The key point is that at -12°C, the water is frozen. 

So perhaps the answers are:

A) Yes, because water freezes at 0°C and below.

B) The water freezes into ice at 0°C, and then the ice co
