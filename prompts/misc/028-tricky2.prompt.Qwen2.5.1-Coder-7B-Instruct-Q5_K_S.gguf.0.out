Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is right. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere or 101.325 kPa). This is a fundamental property of water. The statement "Water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius" is incorrect. [end of text]
