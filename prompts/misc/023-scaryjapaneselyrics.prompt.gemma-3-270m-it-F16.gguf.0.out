Okay, I understand. I will provide a literal interpretation of the lyrics, focusing on the themes of the song and the fantastical setting. I will try to make it sound like a literal translation, even if it's not a perfect one.

Here's my interpretation:

"ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる"

This song tells a story of a journey through a forest, where the speaker is lost and unable to find their way back to their home. They are surrounded by a seemingly empty pocket, and the speaker is left to navigate the forest alone. The lyrics emphasize the feeling of being lost and the challenges of finding their way back to their place. The "予約は一つもありません" (reservation is not one) suggests a sense of being stuck or unable to find a way back. The "森の小さなレストラン" (small restaurant) hints at a place of comfort and familiarity, while the "空っぽのポケットを弄って" (empty pocket to disturb) suggests a sense of being overwhelmed and unable to find their way. The "忘れた人から辿り着く" (they found their way to others) suggests a sense of being lost in a group, and the "予約は一つもありません" (reservation is not one) suggests that they are unable to find a way back to their home. The "森の小さなレストラン" (small restaurant) is a place of comfort and familiarity, while the "空席だらけのランチ時" (lunch time with empty seats) suggests a sense of being stuck or unable to find a way back. The "小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる" (the little bird laughs) suggests a sense of being lost and overwhelmed by the sounds of nature. [end of text]
