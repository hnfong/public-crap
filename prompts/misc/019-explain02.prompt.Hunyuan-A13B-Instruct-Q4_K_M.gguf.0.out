Okay, imagine China is like a big family, and the National People's Congress (NPC) is like the big meeting where all the important people in charge of the family come together. These people are chosen by the families (called provinces) in China to help make decisions for everyone. They talk about things like the rules for everyone to follow, the money for the country, and plans to make life better for everyone. It's like when your class has a meeting to decide on the rules for playing games or sharing toys.
