We are creating 8 questions with increasing difficulty.
 Constraints:
 - English questions must contain at least one word with 'z'
 - Chinese questions must contain at least one '平'
 - Mix of English and Chinese
 - Varying topics, objective assessment, concise, creative.

 Let's plan:

 Q1: Easy (English) - include a word with 'z'
 Q2: Easy (Chinese) - include '平'
 Q3: Medium (English) - include 'z'
 Q4: Medium (Chinese) - include '平'
 Q5: Medium-Hard (English) - include 'z'
 Q6: Hard (Chinese) - include '平'
 Q7: Hard (English) - include 'z'
 Q8: Very Hard (Chinese) - include '平'

 We'll cover a wide range of topics: science, history, literature, math, current events, etc.

 Let's create:

 Q1 (Easy, English): 
   Topic: General Knowledge (Famous People)
   Question: What is the name of the famous scientist who formulated the theory of relativity? His last name contains the letter 'z'.
   Answer: Albert Einstein (Note: Einstein has 'z'? Wait, no. Let me check: Einstein -> no 'z'. So we need to adjust.)

   Let me think of another: 
   Alternatively, we can ask about a famous inventor whose first name has a 'z'. 
   How about: "Name a famous Italian Renaissance artist whose name includes the letter 'z'." -> Leonardo da Vinci? No 'z'. 
   Actually, let's use: "Which ancient Greek philosopher, known for his method of questioning, has a name that contains the letter 'z'?" -> Socrates? No. Plato? No. Aristotle? No. 
   Wait, how about: "What is the last name of the scientist who discovered penicillin? It contains the letter 'z'." -> Alexander Fleming -> no 'z'.

   Let's try a different approach: We can use a word in the question that has 'z'. For example:
   "In which amazing country would you find the Great Barrier Reef?" -> Australia (the word 'amazing' has a 'z').

   Revised Q1: 
   Question: In which amazing country is the Great Barrier Reef located?
   Answer: Australia

 Q2 (Easy, Chinese):
   Topic: Geography (China)
   Question: 中国的首都北京位于哪个平原？(Which plain is China's capital Beijing located on?)
   Answer: 华北平原 (North China Plain)

 Q3 (Medium, English):
   Topic: Science (Physics)
   Question: What is the name of the process by which plants utilize sunlight to synthesize foods? This process involves the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The word for this process contains the letter 'z'.
   Answer: Photosynthesis

 Q4 (Medium, Chinese):
   Topic: History
   Question: 明朝的哪位皇帝下令郑和下西洋？请写出他的年号，其中包含“平”字。(Which emperor of the Ming Dynasty ordered Zheng He to sail to the Western Ocean? Write his era name, which contains the character "平".)
   Answer: 永乐 (Yongle) -> Wait, does it contain "平"? No. Let me check: 永乐 doesn't have 平. 
   Actually, we need the era name to have 平. How about: 
   "请说出中国历史上一个以'平'字开头的年号。" (Name an era name in Chinese history that starts with the character '平'.)
   Possible answers: 太平 (from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, but that's not an imperial era) OR 建平 (Jianping, from the Han Dynasty) OR 和平 (Heping, from the Han Dynasty) OR 太平兴国 (Taiping Xingguo, from Song Dynasty) - but we can take the first two characters as the era name.

   Alternatively, we can change the question to:
   Question: 中国历史上，哪位皇帝的年号中包含“平”字？请举一例。(In Chinese history, which emperor's era name contains the character "平"? Give one example.)
   Answer: 汉哀帝 (Emperor Ai of Han) had the era name 建平 (Jianping). Or 汉桓帝 (Emperor Huan of Han) had 和平 (Heping). Or 宋太宗 (Emperor Taizong of Song) had 太平兴国 (Taiping Xingguo).

   But to be more specific, we can ask for one of the well-known ones.

   Alternatively, we can do a different topic to make it easier to include 平.
   How about: 
   Question: 在数学中，一个平面上的三角形内角和是多少度？(In mathematics, what is the sum of the interior angles of a triangle on a plane?)
   Answer: 180 degrees.

   But that's too easy? And we already have a math one? Let's stick to history and adjust.

   Revised Q4:
   Question: 请说出中国历史上一个以'平'字开头的年号。(Name an era name in Chinese history that starts with the character '平'.)
   Answer: 建平 (Jianping) or 和平 (Heping) or 太平 (Taiping, from the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, though not an imperial dynasty era) or 太平兴国 (Taiping Xingguo). We can accept any of these.

   But note: The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom is a rebel state, so if we want imperial era, we can specify. However, the question doesn't specify imperial. So we can accept.

   Alternatively, we can use:
   Question: 在三国时期，诸葛亮在哪场著名战役中使用了“空城计”？该战役的名称中包含“平”字。(During the Three Kingdoms period, in which famous battle did Zhuge Liang use the "Empty Fort Strategy"? The name of the battle contains the character "平".)
   Answer: 街亭之战 (Jieting) -> no 平. Actually, the battle of Jieting doesn't have 平. The strategy was used in the battle of Xiping? Actually, the story is set in the Battle of Xicheng, but it's not a real battle. The common name is the "Empty Fort Strategy" at Xicheng. But we can use a battle that has 平: 平阳之战? Not famous.

   Let me change to a different topic: Literature.
   Question: 《红楼梦》中，贾宝玉的哪位丫鬟最终被逐出大观园，名字中包含“平”字？(In "Dream of the Red Chamber", which maid of Jia Baoyu, whose name contains the character "平", was eventually expelled from the Grand View Garden?)
   Answer: 晴雯 (Qingwen) -> no 平. Actually, there is 平儿 (Ping'er), but she is Wang Xifeng's maid, not Baoyu's. And she wasn't expelled.

   How about: 
   Question: 在《三国演义》中，关羽“水淹七军”发生在哪个地方？该地名包含“平”字。(In "Romance of the Three Kingdoms", where did Guan Yu's "Drowning the Seven Armies" take place? The place name contains the character "平".)
   Answer: 樊城 (Fancheng) -> no 平. Actually, it was at Fancheng and Xiangyang. But there is a place called 平鲁? Not related.

   Let's stick to the era name one.

   Final Q4: 
   Question: 请说出中国历史上一个包含'平'字的年号。(Name an era name in Chinese history that contains the character '平'.)
   Answer: 建平 (Jianping, Han Dynasty) or 和平 (Heping, Han Dynasty) or 太平兴国 (Taiping Xingguo, Song Dynasty) or 太平真君 (Taiping Zhenjun, Northern Wei) etc.

 Q5 (Medium-Hard, English):
   Topic: Mathematics
   Question: What is the value of the Riemann zeta function at 2? (Hint: It is a famous constant related to circles.)
   Answer: π²/6

 Q6 (Hard, Chinese):
   Topic: Science (Chemistry)
   Question: 在元素周期表中，哪种元素的原子序数为1，并且其名称中包含“平”字？(In the periodic table, which element has atomic number 1 and its Chinese name contains the character "平"?)
   Answer: 氢 (hydrogen) -> does it contain 平? No. 氢 has no 平.

   How about we change: 
   Question: 在化学中，pH值为7的溶液被称为什么？(In chemistry, what is a solution with pH 7 called?) -> but we need 平 in the question? The question must have 平. We can say:
   "在化学中，pH值为7的溶液呈什么性？请用包含'平'字的词语回答。" -> 中性 (neutral) -> 中性 has no 平.

   Alternatively, we can use:
   Question: 在化学中，我们常用什么术语来描述一个反应中反应物和生成物的质量关系？该术语包含'平'字。(In chemistry, what term do we use to describe the mass relationship between reactants and products in a reaction? This term contains the character '平'.)
   Answer: 平衡 (balance, as in chemical equilibrium) -> but the term for the mass relationship in a reaction is stoichiometry, which in Chinese is 化学计量学, no 平. The law of conservation of mass? 质量守恒定律, no 平.

   How about: 
   Question: 在化学反应中，当正反应和逆反应速率相等时，体系达到什么状态？(In a chemical reaction, when the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal, what state does the system reach?) -> and we require the answer to have 平? Actually, the answer is 化学平衡 (chemical equilibrium). So we can ask the question without requiring the answer to have 平, but the question must have 平. We can put 平 in the question by saying:
   "在化学反应中，当正逆反应速率相等时，体系达到平衡状态。请问这种状态叫什么？" -> but then we are giving the answer in the question.

   Revised: 
   Question: 在化学反应中，
