Alice is scientifically correct: water freezes at 0°C under standard atmospheric pressure.

Bob is *technically* wrong if he claims water freezes at -10°C under standard conditions — that’s simply false. But if Bob means “water *can* freeze at -10°C” (which it does, once it’s already cooled below 0°C), then he’s *technically* not wrong in a trivial sense — water *does* freeze at -10°C, but only *after* it has already passed 0°C and is now colder.

So:  
- **Alice is correct** about the freezing point: water freezes *at* 0°C under standard conditions.  
- Bob is misleading — water *can* be frozen *at* -10°C, but it froze *at* 0°C. Saying “water freezes at -10°C” is scientifically inaccurate as a statement of the freezing point.

**Alice is right. Bob is wrong.**  
Water freezes *at* 0°C — not at -10°C. [end of text]
