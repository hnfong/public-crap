Explain the role of China's National People Congress to a 5 year old child who lives in London.

Okay, imagine China is like a really, really big playground with lots of different games and activities. 

The National People Congress is like the oldest, biggest rule-making board in China. It's like a group of really important grown-ups who are older than your grandparents! 

**But it's not like a regular government.** It's more like a big, old council. 

**What do they do?** They mostly talk about things like:

* **What rules are good for everyone to follow:** Like making sure everyone plays fairly in the playground.
* **What kind of games they want to play:** Like deciding what kind of toys are allowed.
* **Making sure everyone is happy and safe:** Like making sure the playground is clean and everyone has a good time.

**Important thing to remember:**  Now, China has a new government called the People's Congress, which is like a smaller, newer board. They make the rules *together* with the new government. 

**It's like a big, old tradition, but it's not as powerful as the new government now.** 

Does that make sense? Do you want to talk about another game or something else? [end of text]
