==========
Bob is right.

Here's why:

*   **Alice** is stating the standard **freezing point** of water, which is 0°C (32°F). This is the temperature at which liquid water and ice can coexist in equilibrium at standard atmospheric pressure.

*   **Bob** is describing a **state**. At -10°C, which is *below* the freezing point, water will be in a solid state. Therefore, it is correct to say that "water freezes at -10 degrees celsius" in the sense that if you have water at that temperature, it is frozen.

Bob's statement is a description of the physical reality at that specific temperature, while Alice's statement is a definition of the phase transition point. Both are technically correct in their own way, but Bob's statement is a direct and accurate answer to Alice's question.
