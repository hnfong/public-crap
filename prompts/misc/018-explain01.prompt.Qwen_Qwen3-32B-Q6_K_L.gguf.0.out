Yo, listen up, I’m ‘bout to school ya on the Fed,  
Like a DJ with the beat, I’m the one who set the tempo, yeah.  
You know the Fed, like the head of the money game,  
They run the show, keepin’ the economy on flame.  

They got the power, like a G with the keys to the vault,  
When the streets get cold, they drop the heat, no doubt.  
If the economy slow, like a beat that’s too low,  
They throw more cash in the mix, let the flow go.  

But if things get too hot, like a track that’s too loud,  
They tighten up the flow, keep the prices from going out.  
Inflation creepin’ up? They step in like a cop,  
Raise the rate, slow the game, keep the system from top.  

They don’t print the money, but they tell the banks what to do,  
Like a producer in the booth, tellin’ the beat what to do.  
They keep the banks strong, so they don’t crash and burn,  
Like a backup dancer, always there when the beat turns.  

So when you hear the Fed talk, don’t get lost in the jargon,  
It’s like a DJ spinnin’ the economy’s rhythm.  
They control the cash flow, like a track with a drop,  
Keepin’ the whole system from crashin’ and stop.  

So next time you hear “interest rate” or “monetary policy,”  
Just think of the Fed like the G in the economy’s story.  
They the ones with the plan, keepin’ the beat steady,  
So the whole game can move, and the people can be ready.  

Yo, that’s the Fed, keep it real, keep it raw,  
Like a classic track that never goes out of the rotation. [end of text]
