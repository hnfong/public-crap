Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Alice is right. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). At -10 degrees Celsius, water is still in its liquid state, but it is very close to freezing. Bob's statement is incorrect because -10 degrees Celsius is below the freezing point of water, but not the temperature at which water freezes. 

To be precise, water will start to freeze at 0 degrees Celsius, and at -10 degrees Celsius, it would be frozen solid. However, Bob's logic is flawed because he is confusing the freezing point with a temperature below it. 

In summary, Alice is correct about the freezing point of water, and Bob's statement is incorrect. 

To clarify Bob's misunderstanding: Water will indeed be frozen at -10 degrees Celsius, but it does not freeze at that temperature; it freezes at 0 degrees Celsius and remains frozen at -10 degrees Celsius. Bob's statement is misleading because it implies that -10 degrees Celsius is the freezing point, which is not accurate. 

Therefore, Alice is correct in her statement about the freezing point of water, and Bob's statement is incorrect. [end of text]
