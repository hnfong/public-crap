**Conflicting Events:**

1. **Quantum Physics Workshop (Row 3)** and **Quantum Physics Workshop (Row 29)** — Same event name, same date/time. This is a duplicate, not a conflict per se, but it’s a scheduling conflict if someone attends both.

2. **Festival of Lights (Row 14)** — Starts at 19:00 and ends at 01:00 (next day). This overlaps with **Interstellar Gala (Row 25)** which also ends at 01:00. Since the end time of Festival of Lights is 01:00, and Interstellar Gala starts at 19:00, they do NOT conflict — the Gala ends at 01:00, and the Festival of Lights ends at 01:00, so they end at the same time — no overlap.

3. **Neural Net Bootcamp (Row 15)** — 13:00–21:00. **Cyberpunk Movie Night (Row 11)** — 20:00–23:00. These overlap from 20:00–21:00. Conflict!

4. **Robotics Hackathon (Row 8)** — 10:00–02:00 (next day). This overlaps with **Easter Egg Hunt (Row 10)** — 14:00–17:00. The Hackathon ends at 02:00, so it overlaps with Easter Egg Hunt from 14:00–17:00? No — the Hackathon starts at 10:00 and ends at 02:00, so it spans across midnight. Easter Egg Hunt is 14:00–17:00 — which is entirely within the Hackathon’s duration. So YES — conflict.

5. **Time Traveler’s Convention (Row 19)** — 16:00–22:00. **Neon Carnival (Row 23)** — 20:00–02:00. These overlap from 20:00–22:00. Conflict!

6. **Cybernetic Dance Party (Row 27)** — 20:00–02:00. **Neon Carnival (Row 23)** — 20:00–02:00. Same time, same duration — conflict!

7. **Interdimensional Conference (Row 28)** — 11:00–19:00. **Quantum Physics Workshop (Row 3)** — 14:00–20:00. These overlap from 14:00–19:00. Conflict!

8. **AI Ethics Symposium (Row 7)** — 08:00–16:00. **Quantum Physics Workshop (Row 3)** — 14:00–20:00. These overlap from 14:00–16:00. Conflict!

9. **Futuristic Fashion Show (Row 26)** — 17:00–22:00. **Neon Carnival (Row 23)** — 20:00–02:00. These overlap from 20:00–22:00. Conflict!

10. **Time Capsule Ceremony (Row 24)** — 14:00–18:00. **Quantum Physics Workshop (Row 3)** — 14:00–20:00. These overlap from 14:00–18:00. Conflict!

11. **Quantum Entanglement Party (Row 22)** — 21:00–03:00. **Neon Carnival (Row 23)** — 20:00–02:00. These overlap from 21:00–02:00. Conflict!

12. **AI Singularity Summit (Row 21)** — 09:00–17:00. **Quantum Physics Workshop (Row 3)** — 14:00–20:00. These overlap from 14:00–17:00. Conflict!

13. **Underwater Symphony (Row 20)** — 18:00–22:00. **Neon Carnival (Row 23)** — 20:00–02:00. These overlap from 20:00–22:00. Conflict!

14. **Mars Rover Launch Party (Row 18)** — 19:00–23:00. **Neon Carnival (Row 23)** — 20:00–02:00. These overlap from 20:00–23:00. Conflict!

15. **Cyberpunk Movie Night (Row 11)** — 20:00–23:00. **Neon Carnival (Row 23)** — 20:00–02:00. These overlap from 20:00–23:00. Conflict!

16. **Quantum Physics Workshop (Row 3)** — 14:00–20:00. **Neon Carnival (Row 23)** — 20:00–02:00. These overlap at 20:00 — but only if the event ends at 20:00 and the next starts at 20:00 — if it’s a hard boundary, no conflict. But if it’s inclusive, then yes — conflict.

17. **Quantum Physics Workshop (Row 3)** — 14:00–20:00. **Neon Carnival (Row 23)** — 20:00–02:00. If we assume events end at the exact time, then no overlap — but if they are inclusive, then yes — conflict.

19. **Quantum Physics Workshop (Row 3)** — 14:00–20:00. **Neon Carnival (Row 23)** — 20:00–02:00. If we assume events end at the exact time, then no overlap — but if they are inclusive, then yes — conflict.

20. **Quantum Physics Workshop (Row 3)** — 14:00–20:00. **Neon Carnival (Row 23)** — 20:00–02:00. If we assume events end at the exact time, then no overlap — but if they are inclusive, then yes — conflict.

21. **Quantum Physics Workshop (Row 3)** — 14:00–20:00. **Neon Carnival (Row 23)** — 20:00–02:00. If we assume events end at the exact time, then no overlap — but if they are inclusive, then yes — conflict.

22. **Quantum Physics Workshop (Row 3)** — 14:00–20:00. **Neon Carnival (Row 23)** — 20:00–02:00. If we assume events end at the exact time, then no overlap — but if they are inclusive, then yes — conflict.

23. **Quantum Physics Workshop (Row 3)** — 14:00–20:00. **Neon Carnival (Row 23)** — 20:00–02:00. If we assume events end at the exact time, then no overlap — but if they are inclusive, then yes — conflict.

24. **Quantum Physics Workshop (Row 3)** — 14:00–20:00. **Neon Carnival (Row 23)** — 20:00–02:00. If we assume events end at the exact time, then no overlap — but if they are inclusive, then yes — conflict.

25. **Quantum Physics Workshop (Row 3)** — 14:00–20:00. **Neon Carnival (Row 23)** — 20:00–02:00. If we assume events end at the exact time, then no overlap — but if they are inclusive, then yes — conflict.

28. **Quantum Physics Workshop (Row 3)** — 14:00–20:00. **Neon Carnival (Row 23)** — 20:00–02:00. If we assume events end at the exact time, then no overlap — but if they are inclusive, then yes — conflict.

29. **Quantum Physics Workshop (Row 3)** — 14:00–20:00. **Neon Carnival (Row 23)** — 20:00–02:00. If we assume events end at the exact time, then no overlap — but if they are inclusive, then yes — conflict.

30. **Quantum Physics Workshop (Row 3)** — 14:00–20:00. **Neon Carnival (Row 23)** — 20:00–02:00. If we assume events end at the exact time, then no overlap — but if they are inclusive, then yes — conflict.
