We need to parse the input lines and identify which lines contain dialog or spoken text. The query is "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". So we need to output lines that have spoken words, i.e., direct speech. In Chinese, direct speech is often enclosed in quotation marks: 「...」 or 『...』. Also sometimes spoken text may be indicated by other punctuation like "!" or "?" but the typical representation is within quotes. The input includes lines with Chinese punctuation for quotes: 「 and 」. Also there are lines with "..." inside quotes. Also there are lines with "!!!" etc. The lines that contain dialog are those that have quoted text. Also line 33: "我「屌」一聲" includes a quoted "屌". That's also spoken text? It's a spoken exclamation. The line includes a quote around the word "屌". That is a spoken exclamation. So we should include that line as well.

Also line 45: 「阿呆，哎暗若餓花打。」 That's a line with quotes. So include.

Line 46: 「？？？」 is a line with quotes. So include.

Line 50: 「我先唔係你老豆呀，哼哼。」 includes quotes.

Line 27: 「哼，大膽狂徒，你係邊個！點解要暗算老夫！」 includes quotes.

Line 28: "聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。難怪我同佢對打可以力拔山河。平時我邊有咁大力？佢口裡強硬，卻一個翻身跳出牆外，似乎想逃走。" This line does not have quotes. It contains narration, not direct speech.

The description says "dialog or spoken text". Typically dialog is direct speech quoted. Spoken text could be any utterance, but we need to be careful: The line includes "聽黑衣人嘅聲音，竟然似係女人。" That's describing the voice, not direct speech. The line includes "佢口裡強硬，卻一個翻身跳出牆外，似乎想逃走。" That's also not direct speech. So we should not include line 28.

Line 8: 「啊～！」老夫同漢昭烈帝一樣係蓋世英雄，立即虎口劇震，筷子連同夾緊嗰嚿叉燒一齊跌咗落地。「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」 This line includes two quoted parts: 「啊～！」 and 「⋯⋯嚇死老夫喇。」 So it's dialog.

Line 12: 「轟隆！」 呢次雷聲，果然帶來傾盤大雨，屋外屋頂雨聲不絕。 This line includes a quoted "轟隆!" plus narration. So include.
