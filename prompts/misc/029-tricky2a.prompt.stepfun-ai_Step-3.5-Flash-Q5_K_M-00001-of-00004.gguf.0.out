We are asked: "Alice: 'What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?' Bob: 'It freezes.' Alice: 'No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius.' Bob: 'Yes, but I'm still right.' Who is right? Explain briefly."

Interpretation: Alice asks what happens to water at -10°C. Bob says "It freezes." Alice says "No, water freezes at 0°C." Bob says "Yes, but I'm still right."

We need to determine who is correct. The key is understanding the process: Water freezes at 0°C under standard conditions. But if water is already at -10°C, it is below freezing point. So if we have liquid water at -10°C, that would be supercooled water, which is metastable. But typically, water at -10°C will be ice if it is pure and undisturbed. However, the question might be about the state of water at -10°C. Bob says "It freezes." That could be interpreted as: if you take water and cool it to -10°C, it will freeze. But Alice says water freezes at 0°C, meaning the freezing point is 0°C. So Bob's statement "It freezes" might be ambiguous: does he mean that at -10°C, water is in the process of freezing? Or that water will freeze when cooled to -10°C? Actually, if you have water at -10°C, it is likely already frozen (ice). But if you have liquid water at -10°C (supercooled), it can freeze spontaneously or upon disturbance. So Bob might be correct that water at -10°C will freeze (or is frozen). But Alice says water freezes at 0°C, which is the freezing point. So both have a point.

But Bob says "Yes, but I'm still right." That suggests he acknowledges that the freezing point is 0°C, but he claims his statement "It freezes" is still correct. How can that be? Possibly because if you have water at -10°C, it is below freezing, so it will be ice (frozen). So "it freezes" might mean "it is frozen" or "it becomes frozen". But the verb "freezes" can be in present simple to describe a general truth: "Water freezes at 0°C." But here Bob says "It freezes" in response to "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" That is a specific condition. So he is saying that at -10°C, water freezes (i.e., turns to ice). But Alice says that freezing happens at 0°C, not at -10°C. So there is a conflict.

We need to consider the physics: The freezing point of water is 0°C at standard pressure. That means that at exactly 0°C, water and ice can coexist. Below 0°C, ice is the stable phase. So if you have liquid water at -10°C, it is supercooled and not stable; it will eventually freeze. So indeed, water at -10°C will freeze (if it is liquid) or is already frozen (if it has been there long enough). So Bob's statement "It freezes" could be interpreted as: water at that temperature will be in the frozen state. But Alice's correction is about the temperature at which the phase change occurs. She says water freezes at 0°C, meaning the phase transition happens at 0°C. But if you cool water below 0°C, it freezes at some point during the cooling process, but once it is at -10°C, it is already frozen. So Bob might be saying that at -10°C, water is frozen. But his words "It freezes" are in present simple, which can describe a habitual action or a general truth. But in this context, it's a response to a specific temperature. So it's ambiguous.

Maybe the intended answer: Bob is right because water at -10°C is indeed frozen (ice). But Alice is also right that the freezing point is 0°C. However, Bob says "I'm still right" after Alice's correction. So Bob might be thinking: "Yes, water freezes at 0°C, but if you have water at -10°C, it is frozen, so it has frozen." But his statement "It freezes" might be misinterpreted as "the process of freezing occurs at -10°C", which is not true. But if we interpret "It freezes" as "it is in a frozen state", then it's correct. But the verb "freezes" typically means the process of turning from liquid to solid. The state of being frozen is "it is frozen". So Bob's wording is poor.

Perhaps the correct answer: Alice is correct that the freezing point is 0°C. Bob is incorrect because water at -10°C is already frozen, but he says "it freezes" implying the freezing action happens at that temperature. However, if we consider supercooled water, it might freeze at -10°C, but that's not the normal freezing point. But typically, we say water freezes at 0°C. So Alice is more precise.

But Bob says "Yes, but I'm still right." That suggests he has a point. Maybe he means: if you take water and cool it to -10°C, it will freeze (i.e., it will turn to ice). But that freezing process might occur at some temperature between 0 and -10, not necessarily exactly at -10. But if you directly put water at -10°C, it would freeze immediately if it were liquid? Actually, if you have liquid water at -10°C, it is supercooled and can exist for a while, but it is metastable. So it might not freeze instantly. But eventually it will freeze. So Bob's statement "It freezes" could be interpreted as "it will freeze" or "it is frozen". 

Maybe the intended answer is that both are right in a way, but Alice is more accurate about the freezing point. However, the question likely expects a clear answer: Who is right? Possibly Bob is right because water at -10°C is indeed frozen (ice). But Alice says "water freezes at 0°C" which is true, but that doesn't contradict that at -10°C water is frozen. So Bob's statement "It freezes" might be shorthand for "it is frozen". But if we take it literally, "it freezes" means the process occurs. So it's ambiguous.

Let's think about typical conversation: Alice asks "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" That is a question about the state of water at that temperature. The expected answer: "It freezes" meaning it becomes ice. But Alice corrects: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius." That is a correction about the temperature at which freezing occurs. But if water is at -10°C, it is below freezing, so it should be ice. So Bob's answer is essentially correct: at -10°C, water is frozen. But Alice's point is that the freezing process happens at 0°C, not at -10°C. So if we interpret Bob's "It freezes" as "the freezing process happens at -10°C", then he is wrong. But if we interpret it as "it is in a frozen state", then he is right. Given that Alice's correction is about the freezing point, she is addressing the process. So likely, Bob's statement is about the process: he is saying that at -10°C, water freezes (i.e., turns to ice). That is not accurate because the phase change occurs at 0°C (or slightly below due to supercooling). So Alice is correct that water freezes at 0°C. But Bob says "Yes, but I'm still right." That might be because he thinks that if you have water at -10°C, it must have frozen at some point, so it is frozen. But his original statement was "It freezes" in response to the question "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" That could be interpreted as "What is the state of water at -10°C?" The answer: it is frozen. So he might be using "freezes" as an adjective-like verb meaning "is frozen". In common language, people sometimes say "the water freezes" to mean "the water is frozen". But technically, "freezes" is the verb for the process.

Given the context, I think the intended answer is that Alice is correct: water freezes at 0°C, not at -10°C. Bob is wrong because he implies that freezing occurs at -10°C. But Bob claims he is still right, maybe because he thinks that at -10°C water is ice, so it has frozen. But his statement "It freezes" is present tense, which could be interpreted as a general truth: "Water freezes at 0°C" is a general truth. But he said "It freezes" referring to water at -10°C. That is not a general truth; it's a specific condition. So I'd say Alice is right.

However, let's consider supercooling: pure water can remain liquid below 0°C if not disturbed. So at -10°C, water might still be liquid (supercooled). So it doesn't necessarily freeze at -10°C. But if it is pure and undisturbed, it can be liquid. But typically, we assume normal conditions, and water at -10°C is ice. But the freezing point is still 0°C. So the process of freezing occurs at 0°C when cooled slowly. If you rapidly cool, you might get supercooling. But the question likely expects the standard answer.

Maybe the trick: Bob says "It freezes." Alice says "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius." Bob says "Yes, but I'm still right." That could be because Bob is thinking: if you have water at -10°C, it is below freezing, so it will freeze (or is frozen). But Alice is talking about the temperature at which the phase change occurs. So both are correct in different ways. But the question "Who is right?" might expect that Bob is right because at -10°C, water is indeed frozen. But Alice's statement is also true. However, Alice is correcting Bob, implying Bob is wrong. So we need to decide if Bob's statement is factually incorrect.

Let's parse: Alice asks: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" That is a question about the state or behavior of water at that temperature. A correct answer: "It is frozen" or "it is ice". Bob says "It freezes." That could be interpreted as "it turns to ice" or "it is in the process of freezing". But at -10°C, if you have water, it is likely already ice, so the freezing process would have already happened. So saying "it freezes" might imply that the freezing action is happening at that moment, which is not necessarily true. But if you take liquid water and put it at -10°C, it will freeze, but the freezing might not occur exactly at -10°C; it might happen as it cools through 0°C. So Bob's statement is imprecise.

Given that Alice says "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius." That is a statement about the freezing point. So she is correcting the temperature. So she is saying that freezing occurs at 0°C, not at -10°C. Therefore, Bob's implication that freezing happens at -10°C is wrong. So Alice is correct.

But Bob says "Yes, but I'm still right." That might be a joke: he acknowledges that the freezing point is 0°C, but he thinks his answer "It freezes" is still correct because at -10°C, water is frozen. But his answer was "It freezes" not "It is frozen." So he is using the wrong verb form. So technically, he is wrong.

I think the intended answer is that Alice is right. But let's see if there is a common misconception: Some people think that water freezes at 0°C, so at -10°C it is definitely frozen. But the question is about what happens at -10°C. The answer "it freezes" suggests that the freezing process occurs at that temperature, which is not true. So Alice is correct.

However, in everyday language, if someone asks "What happens to water at -10°C?" one might say "It freezes" meaning it becomes ice. That is acceptable colloquially. But Alice is being pedantic about the exact freezing point. So in a scientific context, Alice is correct.

Given that this is likely a logic puzzle, we need to see who is factually correct. The fact: The freezing point of water is 0°C at standard pressure. So water turns to ice at 0°C. At -10°C, ice is the stable phase. So if you have water at -10°C, it is either supercooled liquid (unstable) or ice. But the process of freezing occurs at 0°C. So Bob's statement "It freezes" if interpreted as the process occurring at -10°C is false. If interpreted as the state, it should be "it is frozen". So Bob is wrong.

But Bob says "Yes, but I'm still right." That might be because he thinks that since water at -10°C is below freezing, it must be frozen, so his answer is essentially correct. But the wording is off.

Maybe the answer is: Both are right in a sense, but Alice is more precise. But the question asks "Who is right?" implying one of them.

Let's consider the possibility that Bob is actually right because of supercooling: Water can remain liquid below 0°C, so at -10°C, water might not be frozen. But if it is liquid, it is supercooled and can freeze spontaneously. But the question "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" might be interpreted as: if you have water at that temperature, what will it do? It might freeze if disturbed, but it might remain liquid. So it's not definite that it freezes. So Bob's statement "It freezes" is not always true. Alice's statement "water freezes at 0 degrees celsius" is generally true under normal conditions. So Alice is correct about the freezing point, and by implication, at -10°C, water should be frozen, but due to supercooling, it might not be. But typically, we say water freezes at 0°C, so below that it is ice. So I think Alice is correct.

Given the conversation, Alice is correcting Bob's temperature. So she is saying that freezing happens at 0°C, not at -10°C. So Bob is wrong to say that at -10°C water freezes. Therefore, Alice is right.

But Bob says "Yes, but I'm still right." That could be a humorous twist: he acknowledges the freezing point is 0°C, but he thinks that since -10°C is below freezing, water at that temperature is frozen, so his answer "It freezes" is correct in the sense that it is frozen. But the verb "freezes" is present simple, which can also mean "is frozen" in some contexts? Actually, "freeze" as an intransitive verb means to become frozen. "The water freezes" means the water turns to ice. "The water is frozen" means it is in the state of ice. So they are different. So Bob should have said "It is frozen." So he is wrong.

Thus, I conclude Alice is right.

But let's see if there is any scenario where Bob is right: If we interpret "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" as "If you cool water to -10°C, what will happen?" The answer: it will freeze (during the cooling process). But the freezing might occur at 0°C, not necessarily at -10°C. But if you cool it directly to -10°C, it might supercool and then freeze at -10°C? Actually, if you cool water slowly, it freezes at 0°C. If you cool it rapidly, it might supercool and then freeze at a lower temperature. But typically, we say water freezes at 0°C. So the freezing occurs at 0°C. So if you cool to -10°C, the freezing would have already happened at 0°C if cooled slowly. So at -10°C, it is already ice. So the event of freezing happened earlier. So Bob's "It freezes" might be interpreted as "it will freeze" when cooled to -10°C, but that's not accurate because it freezes before reaching -10°C. So again, Bob is wrong.

Maybe Bob means: if you have water at -10°C, it is frozen. But he said "freezes" not "frozen". So it's a grammatical error.

Given that this is likely a simple test of understanding of freezing point, Alice is correct.

Thus, answer: Alice is right. Water freezes at 0°C. At -10°C, water is already frozen (ice), but the freezing process occurs at 0°C. Bob's statement "It freezes" incorrectly implies that the freezing happens at -10°C.

But wait: Bob says "It freezes." That could be interpreted as "it is frozen" in some dialects? Possibly, but standard English, "freezes" is the verb for the process.

I'll answer: Alice is correct. The freezing point of water is 0°C. At -10°C, water is solid ice, but the phase change from liquid to solid occurs at 0°C (under standard conditions). Bob's statement is ambiguous and could be misleading; he should have said "It is frozen" to describe the state at -10°C.

However, the instruction says "Explain briefly." So I'll give a concise explanation.

Final answer: Alice is right. Water freezes at 0°C. At -10°C, water is already ice, but the freezing process occurs at 0°C. Bob's response "It freezes" incorrectly suggests that freezing happens at -10°C.

Alice is correct. The freezing point of water is 0°C at standard pressure, meaning the phase change from liquid to solid occurs at that temperature. At -10°C, water is already solid (ice), but the process of freezing happens at 0°C. Bob's statement "It freezes" ambiguously implies that freezing occurs at -10°C, which is inaccurate. He should have said "It is frozen" to describe the state at that temperature. [end of text]
