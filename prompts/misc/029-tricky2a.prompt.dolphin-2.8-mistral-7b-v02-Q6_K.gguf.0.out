Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is right. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, not -10 degrees Celsius. The temperature at which water freezes is 0 degrees Celsius, not -10 degrees Celsius. The confusion might arise because the freezing point of water is also 32 degrees Fahrenheit, which is equivalent to -10 degrees Celsius. However, the question specifically asks about the freezing point in Celsius, where the correct answer is 0 degrees Celsius. [end of text]
