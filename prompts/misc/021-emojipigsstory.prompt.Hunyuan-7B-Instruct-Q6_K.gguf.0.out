🐷🐷🐷  
Three little pigs built their houses, each with their own style.  
The first built a 🏠 made of straw,  
The second built a 🏠 made of sticks,  
And the third built a 🏠 made of bricks.  

The first two pigs 🐷🐷 laughed at the third pig,  
"Your house is so weak! It’ll collapse!"  
But the third pig 🐷 just smiled and said,  
"My house is strong. Let’s see what happens!"  

One day, a 🌪️ came to visit.  
The first two pigs 🐷🐷 were scared,  
"Run, run, run!" they cried.  
The third pig 🐷 called out,  
"Stay! My house is strong!"  

The 🌪️ pushed the straw house,  
It collapsed in a 😱.  
The 🌪️ pushed the stick house,  
It also collapsed in a 😱.  
But the third pig 🐷’s brick house stood tall,  
The 🌪️ was 😵.  

The 🌪️ said, "You’re the smartest pig!  
Your house is 🔥.  
I’ll never come back!"  

The three pigs 🐷🐷🐷 laughed and played,  
"See? 🏠🏠🏠  
Strong houses make the best!"
