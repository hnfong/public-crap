**Alice is right.**

Here is the brief explanation:

*   **Freezing Point:** Pure water freezes at **0°C** (32°F) under standard atmospheric pressure.
*   **State at -10°C:** At -10°C, water is indeed frozen (ice), but the *process* of freezing occurs at 0°C.
*   **Bob's Error:** Bob's statement ("Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius") implies that the phase change happens at that specific temperature, which is scientifically incorrect. While water *is* frozen at -10°C, it does not *freeze* (transition from liquid to solid) at that temperature; it would have already frozen at 0°C.

Therefore, Alice correctly identifies the freezing point, while Bob is confusing the state of the water with the temperature at which the phase change occurs. [end of text]
