Here is the breakdown of the optimal plays and the outcome based on Magic: The Gathering rules (as of 2024).

### The Outcome
**Orim, Samite Healer survives.**

Alice cannot kill Orim with the two Kindle cards in her hand.

---

### Detailed Analysis and Thought Process

#### 1. The Math of the Kindle
First, we must determine the value of $X$ for Alice's spells.
*   **Kindle Text:** "Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards."
*   **Initial State:** There are no cards in the graveyards.
*   **First Kindle:** When Alice casts the first Kindle, there are 0 Kindles in the graveyard. Therefore, $X = 2 + 0 = 2$.
*   **Second Kindle:** When Alice casts the second Kindle, the first Kindle is now in the graveyard. Therefore, $X = 2 + 1 = 3$.

Alice has access to a spell that deals 2 damage and a spell that deals 3 damage, for a total of 5 potential damage.

#### 2. Orim's Capabilities
*   **Orim's Toughness:** 3.
*   **Orim's Ability:** "Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn."
*   **Strategic Value:** Orim can prevent exactly 3 damage. Since Orim has 3 toughness, preventing 3 damage is effectively equivalent to gaining 3 life or regenerating her for the turn. If Alice deals 3 damage to Orim, Bob can tap Orim to prevent it all. If Alice deals 2 damage, Bob can tap Orim to prevent it all (wasting 1 point of prevention, but saving the creature).

#### 3. The Interaction (Game Tree)

Alice wants to deal 3 damage to Orim. She has two main lines of play: casting the spells sequentially or casting them simultaneously (using the Stack).

**Scenario A: Alice casts the Kindle that deals 3 damage first.**
1.  Alice casts the second Kindle (from her hand). $X=3$.
2.  The spell goes on the stack targeting Orim.
3.  Bob gets priority. He sees 3 damage coming.
4.  **Optimal Play for Bob:** Bob taps Orim to activate her ability, targeting herself.
5.  A "shield" preventing the next 3 damage is created.
6.  The Kindle resolves. It deals 3 damage. The shield prevents 3 damage. Orim takes 0 damage.
7.  Alice now casts the Kindle that deals 2 damage ($X=2$).
8.  Bob has no response (Orim is already tapped, the shield is used up).
9.  The Kindle resolves. It deals 2 damage. Orim is at 3 toughness, takes 2 damage, and survives with 1 toughness remaining.
10. **Result:** Orim lives.

**Scenario B: Alice casts the Kindle that deals 2 damage first.**
1.  Alice casts the first Kindle ($X=2$).
2.  Bob gets priority. He sees 2 damage coming.
3.  **Optimal Play for Bob:** Bob taps Orim to prevent the next 3 damage.
4.  The Kindle resolves. 2 damage is prevented by the shield (1 point of prevention is wasted).
5.  Alice casts the second Kindle ($X=3$).
6.  Bob has no response (Orim is tapped, shield is gone).
7.  The Kindle resolves. It deals 3 damage. Orim takes 3 damage.
8.  Orim had 3 toughness. She takes 3 damage and is destroyed.
9.  **Result:** Orim dies.

**Scenario C: Alice casts both Kindles simultaneously (The Stack).**
Alice might try to cast both spells and let them resolve to "overload" Bob's prevention ability.
1.  Alice casts Kindle #1 ($X=2$). It goes on the stack.
2.  Alice casts Kindle #2 ($X=3$). It goes on the stack on top of Kindle #1.
3.  The stack looks like: Top [Kindle #3 dmg] -> [Kindle #2 dmg] Bottom.
4.  Bob gets priority while the top spell (Kindle #3) is waiting to resolve.
5.  **Optimal Play for Bob:** Bob sees the 3-damage spell on top. He taps Orim to prevent the next 3 damage.
6.  Kindle #2 resolves. It deals 3 damage. The shield prevents it all.
7.  Kindle #1 resolves. It deals 2 damage. Orim takes 2 damage.
8.  **Result:** Orim lives.

#### 4. The Optimal Play for Both Players

**Alice's Perspective:**
Alice knows that if she casts the 3-damage Kindle first, Bob *must* respond with Orim to save her. If Bob does that, Alice's remaining 2-damage Kindle is insufficient to kill the 3-toughness creature.
However, if Alice casts the 2-damage Kindle first, she creates a "bluffing" opportunity. She hopes Bob will waste Orim's ability on the 2-damage spell. If Bob bites, Alice follows up with the 3-damage spell for the kill.
*   *Alice's Optimal Line:* Cast the 2-damage Kindle first.

**Bob's Perspective:**
Bob is a rational player. He knows the contents of Alice's hand (perfect information scenario) or can deduce the line based on game state. He knows Alice has a 3-damage spell and a 2-damage spell.
If Alice casts the 2-damage Kindle first, Bob knows that if he uses Orim now, he will die to the follow-up 3-damage spell. If he *doesn't* use Orim now, Orim takes 2 damage (going to 1 toughness). Then, when Alice casts the 3-damage Kindle, Bob can tap Orim in response to prevent that 3 damage.
*   *Bob's Optimal Line:* If Alice casts the 2-damage Kindle first, **do nothing**. Let it resolve. Then, when the 3-damage Kindle is cast, tap Orim to prevent that damage.

### Conclusion
Because Bob plays optimally, he will see through Alice's attempt to bait out his prevention ability.

1.  Alice casts Kindle ($X=2$).
2.  Bob **does not** activate Orim. Orim takes 2 damage (Toughness 3 -> 1).
3.  Alice casts Kindle ($X=3$).
4.  Bob taps Orim to prevent the next 3 damage.
5.  The Kindle deals 3 damage, which is prevented.

**Final Outcome:** Orim, Samite Healer survives with 1 toughness remaining. Alice has failed to kill the threat. [end of text]
