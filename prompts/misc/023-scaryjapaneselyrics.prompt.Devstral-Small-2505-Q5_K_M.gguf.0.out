The lyrics of this Japanese song paint a whimsical and fantastical scene set in a small restaurant in the woods. Here's a literal interpretation of the story the lyrics tell:

1. **The Journey to the Restaurant**: The song begins with the narrator trying to find a small restaurant in the forest by following acorns (ドングリ). Despite their efforts, they can't seem to reach the destination. This could be interpreted as a literal journey through a magical forest where acorns lead to a hidden restaurant.

2. **The Empty Restaurant**: Upon finally reaching the restaurant, the narrator finds that there are no reservations (予約は一つもありません) and the place is empty during lunchtime (空席だらけのランチ時). This could be a literal description of a restaurant that is always empty, perhaps due to its hidden location or the fact that it only serves fantastical creatures.

3. **The Menu and Music**: The restaurant's menu only has one recommendation, and the kitchen is filled with the sounds of various musical instruments like violins, flutes, cellos, and violas. This could be a literal description of a restaurant where the food is so good that it inspires music, or perhaps the kitchen staff are also musicians.

4. **The Welcome and Farewell**: The restaurant welcomes guests to eat their fill and then sleep (たらふく食べたらお眠りよ). After that, they bid farewell and say that tomorrow is another day (明日は明日で エトセトラ). This could be a literal description of a restaurant that serves food so good it makes people sleep, and they have to come back the next day for more.

5. **The Busy Staff and the Last Course**: The staff is busy (右から左へおおわらわ), and even a small bear is helping out by dancing. The menu includes carpaccio, paella, risotto, and more, but there's no dessert. The narrator offers to deliver the food even to the grave (お墓の中まで届けましょう), suggesting that this is the last course of the night (今宵は最後のフルコース). This could be a literal description of a restaurant that is so dedicated to its customers that they will deliver food anywhere, even to the afterlife.

In summary, the lyrics tell the story of a fantastical journey to a hidden restaurant in the woods, where the food is so good it inspires music and makes people sleep, and the staff is so dedicated they will deliver food anywhere. The song is filled with whimsy and mischief, fitting the lighthearted melody. [end of text]
