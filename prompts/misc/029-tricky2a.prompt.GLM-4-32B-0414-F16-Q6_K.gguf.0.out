Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10 degrees Celsius, water would indeed be frozen, but the freezing point itself is 0째C. Bob's statement is misleading because it implies that water freezes at -10째C, which is not accurate. The correct interpretation is that water is frozen at -10째C, but the freezing process occurs at 0째C. [end of text]
