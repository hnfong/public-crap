Bob is right. Water does freeze at -10 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure, but this does not mean that water will not freeze at lower temperatures. In fact, water can freeze at lower temperatures, as long as the temperature is low enough and there is enough moisture in the air. At -10 degrees Celsius, water will freeze, but the process may be slower than at 0 degrees Celsius. [end of text]
