Got it, let's tackle this. The user wants all lines with comments from the input. First, I need to remember what a comment line looks like in bash—lines starting with #.

Looking at the input lines:

Line 1: #!/bin/bash – that's a shebang, which is a comment in bash scripts (since it starts with #). Wait, but is the shebang considered a comment here? The query says "all lines with comments". The shebang is a special comment that tells the system it's a bash script, so yes, it has a comment.

Line 4: # Save the path... – definitely a comment.

Line 15: # This is a script... – comment.

Line 20: # Download and build pkg-config – comment.

Line 29: # Download and build ncurses – comment.

Line 38: # Download and build libevent – comment.

Line 48: # Download and build utf8proc – comment.

Line 56: # Download and build tmux – comment.

Now, check each line:

Line 1: Starts with #, so yes.

Line 4: #, yes.

Line 15: #, yes.

Line 20: #, yes.

Line 29: #, yes.

Line 38: #, yes.

Line 48: #, yes.

Line 56: #, yes.

Are there any others? Let's see: lines 2-3,5-3,6-13,16-19,21-27,30-36,39-45,49-54,57-63,65—none start with #. So those are the lines.

Now, format each as "line_number:line_content" followed by "---".</seed:think>1:#!/bin/bash
