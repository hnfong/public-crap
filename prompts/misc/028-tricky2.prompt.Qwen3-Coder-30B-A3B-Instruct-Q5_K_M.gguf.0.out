Alice is right. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. Bob is incorrect in his claim that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius.

However, Bob's statement "Yes, but I'm still right" suggests he might be trying to make a different point - perhaps that water can exist as a liquid below 0°C (supercooled water) or that the freezing point can be affected by factors like pressure or impurities. But in standard conditions, 0°C is the freezing point of water. [end of text]
