 Alice is correct in stating that pure water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. This is the temperature at which water transitions from a liquid to a solid (ice) at 1 atmosphere of pressure.

Bob's statement that "water freezes at -10 degrees celsius" is generally incorrect for pure water. However, Bob could be right under specific conditions. For example, if the water contains impurities such as salt (like seawater), the freezing point can be lowered below 0 degrees Celsius due to the process of freezing point depression. This is known as the colligative property of solutions. Additionally, if the pressure is significantly higher or lower than standard atmospheric pressure, the freezing point of water can also change. For instance, at very high pressures, water can exist in solid forms (ice) at temperatures above 0 degrees Celsius, a phenomenon known as pressure-induced freezing.

In the context of the conversation, without any additional information about impurities or pressure conditions, Alice's correction to Bob is accurate for pure water at standard atmospheric pressure. However, Bob could still be right if he was referring to a specific scenario where water does indeed freeze at -10 degrees Celsius due to the presence of impurities or under non-standard pressure conditions. Without further context, it's difficult to determine the validity of Bob's claim. [end of text]
