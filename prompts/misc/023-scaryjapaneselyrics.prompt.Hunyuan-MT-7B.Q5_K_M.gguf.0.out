Here are the lyrics for the Japanese song:

**Lyrics:**

Even if I follow the trail of acorns, I can’t reach it.
The little restaurant in the forest…
I fiddle with my empty pockets,
Trying to find my way from the person I’ve forgotten.
There aren’t any reservations at all.
The little restaurant in the forest—
It’s full of empty seats during lunchtime.
The little birds are chirping and laughing.

The roof is made of red-tinted tin.
The menu? Just one recommendation, that’s all.
From the kitchen, I can hear the sounds of
Violin, flute, cello, and viola.

Welcome, welcome, please come in!
After eating your fill, you can take a nap.
Well then, goodbye everyone!
Tomorrow is another day, and so on and so forth…

From right to left, everything swirls around.
Even the cubs that can be easily held in the hand start to dance.
There’s carpaccio, paella, and an appetizer platter…
But no dessert available.
Let’s deliver the meal right to the very bottom of the grave…
Tonight is the last time for a full course.

**Interpretation:**

The song describes a magical or whimsical journey to a small restaurant deep within the forest. The protagonist seems to be lost or searching for someone, perhaps a loved one who has been forgotten. Despite the fantastical setting, the lyrics still make sense within this context. The “empty pockets” could symbolize a lack of direction or resources in their search. The mention of a “full course” and “last time” implies a sense of closure or the end of an era.

The use of musical instruments (violin, flute, cello, viola) adds a sense of wonder and enchantment to the atmosphere. The song’s cheerful and playful tone suggests that, even in such a magical place, life goes on as usual, with meals, laughter, and music.

The “little birds laughing” could represent the joy or innocence present in the forest, or it could be a metaphor for the protagonist’s own sense of humor. The mention of a “red-tinted tin roof” adds a touch of whimsy to the image of the restaurant.

The song’s overall theme is one of exploration, discovery, and the acceptance of the unknown. Despite the challenges (the lost person, the empty pockets, the lack of reservations), the protagonist is still determined to find their way to the restaurant, symbolizing the pursuit of happiness or fulfillment, even in the face of adversity.
