Got it, let's tackle these two questions. First, question A: "Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?" I need to remember the normal freezing point of water. Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), pure water freezes at 0°C (32°F). But wait, is there any case where water freezes at a lower temperature? Oh right, if there are impurities, like salt, the freezing point decreases (freezing point depression). Also, if the water is very pure and there are no nucleation sites, it can supercool below 0°C—meaning it stays liquid even below freezing point temporarily. But does that mean it "freezes" at -12°C? The question is a bit ambiguous. The normal freezing point is 0°C, so unless there are specific conditions (like impurities or supercooling), water doesn't freeze at -12°C. So the answer to A is probably no, because under standard conditions, pure water freezes at 0°C, not -12°C.

Now question B: "I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?" Pure water, so no impurities. If it's cooled slowly and there are no nucleation sites (like tiny particles or scratches on the glass), it might supercool—remain liquid below 0°C. But supercooling can't go on forever; eventually, even pure water will freeze if cooled enough, right? The degree of supercooling for pure water can vary, but typically it might supercool to around -40°C or so before freezing, but sometimes it can freeze earlier if disturbed. Wait, but the question says cooled down to -12°C. So if it's pure and supercools, it would stay liquid until maybe a disturbance causes it to freeze rapidly. But does it necessarily freeze at -12°C? No, supercooled water is still liquid until it nucleates. So the answer would be that if it's pure, it might supercool (remain liquid) below 0°C, but eventually, when cooled to -12°C, depending on conditions, it could either still be liquid (supercooled) or start to freeze. But usually, without impurities, pure water can supercool, so cooling to -12°C might result in it being supercooled liquid, but if there's a nucleation event, it would freeze quickly, releasing latent heat.

Wait, let me confirm. Normal freezing point is 0°C at 1 atm. For pure water, the freezing point is 0°C, so below that, it should be solid, but supercooling is a metastable state. So question A is asking "does water freeze at -12°C?"—the answer is no, because the freezing point (equilibrium) is 0°C. Unless specified otherwise, we assume standard conditions, so pure water freezes at 0°C, not -12°C. So A is no.

For B: pure water cooled to -12°C. If it's cooled without nucleation, it supercools (liquid), but if nucleation occurs (like tapping the glass), it freezes exothermically. So the outcome depends on whether it supercools or not, but typically, pure water can supercool below 0°C, so at -12°C, it might still be liquid (supercooled) or have started to freeze if disturbed. But the question says "what happens"—probably the key point is that pure water can supercool, so it may remain liquid temporarily but will eventually freeze, or if nucleation happens, it freezes at -12°C? Wait, no—freezing point is the temperature where liquid and solid are in equilibrium. Below that, the liquid is metastable. So when you cool pure water below 0°C, it's not supposed to be liquid, but it can be if it's supercooled. So at -12°C, the pure water would be in a supercooled liquid state unless it has frozen. So the answer is that it may supercool (remain liquid) but is metastable, so it will eventually freeze upon disturbance or spontaneous nucleation.</seed:think>### A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?  
No. Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), the **normal freezing point of pure water is 0°C**. Water can freeze at lower temperatures only if it contains impurities (e.g., salt, which lowers the freezing point via freezing point depression) or if it is supercooled (a metastable liquid state below 0°C). Without such conditions, water does not freeze at -12°C.  


### B) What happens if a glass of pure water is cooled to -12°C?  
Pure water can **supercool**—remain liquid below 0°C—if cooled slowly and without nucleation sites (e.g., impurities, scratches, or agitation). At -12°C, the water is in a metastable liquid state. However, supercooling is temporary: even tiny disturbances (e.g., tapping the glass) or spontaneous nucleation will cause the water to freeze rapidly, releasing latent heat as it transitions from liquid to solid ice.  

In short: The pure water may initially stay liquid (supercooled) at -12°C but will eventually freeze upon disturbance or spontaneous crystallization. [end of text]
