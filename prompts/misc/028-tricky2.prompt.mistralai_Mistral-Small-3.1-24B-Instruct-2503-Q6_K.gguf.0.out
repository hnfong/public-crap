Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.
Both Alice and Bob are partially correct, but they are discussing different scenarios.

- **Alice** is correct that pure water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure.

- **Bob** is correct in the context of water that contains impurities or is under certain conditions. For example, saltwater freezes at a lower temperature than pure water. In the case of saltwater, the freezing point can be below 0 degrees Celsius, and it can indeed freeze at -10 degrees Celsius depending on the salinity.

So, both are right in their own contexts. [end of text]
