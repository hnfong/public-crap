Both Alice and Bob are partially correct, but they are discussing slightly different aspects of water's behavior at -10 degrees Celsius.

- **Alice** is correct in stating that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. This is the freezing point of pure water.

- **Bob** is also correct in saying that water can be at -10 degrees Celsius. This can happen in a few scenarios:
  1. **Supercooling**: Water can remain liquid below its freezing point if it is pure and free of nucleation sites (impurities or surfaces that can trigger freezing). This is known as supercooling.
  2. **Saltwater**: The freezing point of saltwater is lower than that of pure water. For example, seawater typically freezes at about -2 degrees Celsius, but it can get colder than that without freezing completely.

So, while water normally freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, it can indeed be at -10 degrees Celsius under certain conditions. [end of text]
