A) **No**, water does not freeze at -12°C under normal conditions. Pure water freezes at **0°C** at standard pressure. However, water can **supercool** (remain liquid below 0°C) if it lacks nucleation sites, but this is unstable and not the typical freezing point.  

B) If a glass of **pure water** is cooled to -12°C, one of two things can happen:  
   - If nucleation occurs (e.g., by agitation or impurities), it will **freeze into ice** rapidly.  
   - If the water is very pure and undisturbed, it may **remain liquid (supercooled)** until nucleation triggers freezing.  

(Supercooling is common in controlled conditions, but in practice, most water would freeze by -12°C.) [end of text]
