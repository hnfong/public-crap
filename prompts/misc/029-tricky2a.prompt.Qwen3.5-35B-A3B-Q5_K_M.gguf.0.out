**Bob is right.**

Here is the explanation:
Water freezes at **0°C** (32°F), which is the temperature at which the phase change from liquid to solid begins. However, once water has frozen, it remains a solid at temperatures **below** 0°C, such as -10°C.

*   **Alice** is correct that the *process* of freezing starts at 0°C.
*   **Bob** is correct that at -10°C, water is indeed in a frozen (solid) state.

Bob's statement "It freezes" can be interpreted as "It is frozen" or "It exists as ice," which is factually true at -10°C. [end of text]
