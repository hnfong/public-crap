### Conflict Analysis

Based on the generated data, the following events have conflicts. A conflict occurs when two or more events overlap in time on the same date.

**1. The "Annual Tech Summit" Cluster (May 15, 2023)**
This is the most heavily conflicted day. The "Annual Tech Summit" runs from **09:00 to 17:00**. The following events overlap with it:
*   **Marketing Strategy Workshop** (10:00 – 14:00): Fully contained within the Summit.
*   **Client Onboarding Session** (11:00 – 12:30): Fully contained within the Summit.
*   **Global Sales Kickoff** (09:30 – 11:30): Overlaps the start of the Summit.
*   **Customer Feedback Loop** (13:00 – 15:00): Fully contained within the Summit.
*   **New Hire Orientation** (14:00 – 16:00): Fully contained within the Summit.
*   *Note: The "Annual Tech Summit" also appears three times in the list (Rows 1, 13, and 25) with identical times, creating self-conflicts.*

**2. Duplicate Events**
*   **Marketing Strategy Workshop**: Appears in Row 2 and Row 22 with identical dates and times.
*   **Product Launch Party**: Appears in Row 4 and Row 24 with identical dates and times.
*   **Global Sales Kickoff**: Appears in Row 10 and Row 30 with identical dates and times.
*   **Annual Tech Summit**: Appears in Row 1, Row 13, and Row 25 with identical dates and times.

**Why these are conflicts:**
In a real-world scheduling scenario, a single resource (like a conference room, a specific team, or a key speaker) cannot be in two places at once. For example, on May 15, 2023, the "Annual Tech Summit" occupies the entire day, making it impossible to hold the "Marketing Strategy Workshop" or "Client Onboarding Session" simultaneously unless they are in completely separate locations with no shared resources. The duplicate entries also represent a data integrity conflict where the same event is scheduled twice. [end of text]
