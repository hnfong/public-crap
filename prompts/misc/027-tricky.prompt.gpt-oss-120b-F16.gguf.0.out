<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer two questions with brief explanations.

A) Does water freeze at -12°C? The answer: pure water normally freezes at 0°C under standard pressure, but can be supercooled below 0°C without freezing; at -12°C it will likely freeze spontaneously or nucleate, but if pure and no nucleation sites, it can remain liquid down to about -38°C (homogeneous nucleation). So water does not necessarily freeze exactly at -12°C; it can remain liquid if supercooled, but typical water will freeze before reaching -12°C due to heterogeneous nucleation.

Thus answer: Not necessarily; water's freezing point is 0°C, but supercooling can keep it liquid below that; at -12°C it will likely freeze unless extremely pure and undisturbed.

B) What happens to a glass of pure water cooled to -12°C? If you cool it slowly, it may supercool; if nucleation occurs, it will freeze, releasing latent heat and possibly causing the temperature to rise back to 0°C (or near). In a sealed glass, you could get ice formation, expansion (water expands ~9% upon freezing) possibly breaking the glass. If supercooled, it could remain liquid but be metastable; any disturbance triggers rapid freezing (flash freezing) with release of heat.

Thus answer: It will either remain supercooled liquid (metastable) or freeze, forming ice, releasing latent heat, possibly causing the glass to crack.

Provide brief explanations.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**A) Does water freeze at –12 °C?**  
No.  The normal freezing point of pure water at 1 atm is 0 °C.  Water can stay liquid **below** 0 °C if it is free of impurities or nucleation sites – a state called *super‑cooling*.  In practice most water will nucleate and turn to ice somewhere between 0 °C and about –5 °C, but in a perfectly clean, undisturbed sample it can remain liquid down to roughly –38 °C (the temperature of homogeneous nucleation).  Therefore –12 °C is not a fixed freezing point; water may still be liquid, or it may have already frozen, depending on how it’s been handled.

**B) What happens to a glass of pure water cooled to –12 °C?**  
Two outcomes are possible:

| Situation | What occurs |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Super‑cooled** (no nucleation sites, very gentle cooling) | The water stays liquid at –12 °C, a metastable state. Any disturbance (shaking, a speck of dust, a tiny bubble) will trigger rapid crystallisation, releasing the latent heat of fusion and causing the temperature to jump back toward 0 °C. |
| **Nucleation occurs** (most common) | Ice crystals form, the water freezes, and the released latent heat briefly raises the temperature of the mixture to near 0 °C. As freezing proceeds the volume expands (~9 % increase), which can exert stress on the glass; a sealed or thin‑walled container may crack or burst. |

In everyday conditions the glass will most likely contain ice (partially or fully frozen) rather than remain a stable liquid at –12 °C. [end of text]
