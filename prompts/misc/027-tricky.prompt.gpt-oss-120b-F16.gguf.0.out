<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer two questions: A) Does water freeze at -12°C? B) If we have a glass of pure water and cool it to -12°C, what happens? Provide brief explanations.

We need to consider supercooling, freezing point, nucleation, pure water can be supercooled below 0°C, but at -12°C it will likely freeze spontaneously or need nucleation. In a glass, pure water may supercool to -12°C before freezing, but eventually will freeze, releasing latent heat, temperature rises to 0°C. If pure water is truly pure and no nucleation sites, it can be supercooled to about -38°C (homogeneous nucleation). At -12°C, it's below freezing point, so water is metastable; it may remain liquid if no nucleation, but any disturbance triggers freezing. So answer: A) Water normally freezes at 0°C, but can be supercooled; at -12°C it will freeze if nucleation occurs. B) In a glass, if cooled to -12°C, it may remain liquid as supercooled water, but any perturbation will cause rapid freezing, releasing latent heat and temperature rises to 0°C. Provide brief explanation.

Thus answer: A) No, water's normal freezing point is 0°C, but it can be supercooled below that; at -12°C it will freeze if nucleation occurs. B) The water will become supercooled; if nucleation occurs, it will freeze rapidly, releasing latent heat and warming to 0°C. If no nucleation, it stays liquid as supercooled water. Provide brief explanation.

Let's answer succinctly.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**A)  Does water freeze at –12 °C?**  
No – the normal freezing point of pure water is 0 °C.  However, water can be *super‑cooled* and remain liquid below 0 °C.  In the absence of a nucleation site it can stay liquid down to about –38 °C (the homogeneous‑nucleation limit).  Thus at –12 °C water is metastable: it will freeze if a crystal seed or disturbance is introduced, but it does not *necessarily* freeze just because the temperature is –12 °C.

**B)  What happens to a glass of pure water cooled to –12 °C?**  
When the water is cooled below 0 °C it becomes super‑cooled.  If the glass and the water are perfectly clean and undisturbed, the water can remain liquid at –12 °C.  The moment a nucleation event occurs (e.g., a tiny impurity, a vibration, or a surface defect), the super‑cooled water will crystallize rapidly.  The latent heat of fusion released during freezing raises the temperature of the water‑ice mixture back to the freezing point (≈0 °C), and the glass will then contain ice (and possibly a thin layer of liquid water in equilibrium).  In practice, most glasses contain enough microscopic nucleation sites that the water will begin to freeze shortly after reaching –12 °C. [end of text]
