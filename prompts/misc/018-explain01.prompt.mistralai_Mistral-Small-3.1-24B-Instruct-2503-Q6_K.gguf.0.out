Aight, listen up, I'mma break it down for ya like a beat.

The Federal Reserve, yeah, that's the Fed, it's like the DJ of the economy,
Spinnin' the plates, keepin' the money flowin' steady.
They got the power to raise or lower interest rates,
Like turnin' up the bass or turnin' it down, feel me?

When they raise rates, it's like they're sayin', "Yo, slow it down,
We don't want the economy gettin' too hot, burnin' out."
People borrow less, spend less, keep that inflation in check,
'Cause if prices go crazy, everybody's gonna be stressed.

But when they lower rates, it's like, "Aight, let's get this party started,
Borrow money, spend it, keep the economy jumpin', not departed."
More cash flowin', businesses growin', jobs poppin' off,
But watch out, too much of that, inflation creepin' back, yo.

They also print money, yeah, you heard it right,
But it ain't like they got a printer goin' brrr in the basement, alright?
It's more like they create it digitally, keep the economy movin',
But too much of that, and your dollar ain't worth nothin'.

So the Fed, they watchin' the game, makin' sure it's fair,
Keepin' the economy on track, makin' sure we don't care,
'Cause if it crashes, everybody loses, ain't nobody happy,
So they do what they do, keep the beat steady, keep the money chappy. [end of text]
