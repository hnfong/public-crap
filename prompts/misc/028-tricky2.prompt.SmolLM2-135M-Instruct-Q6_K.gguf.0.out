Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Alice is right because the correct answer is that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius. This is because the freezing point of water is -10 degrees Celsius, which is the same as the freezing point of liquid water. [end of text]
