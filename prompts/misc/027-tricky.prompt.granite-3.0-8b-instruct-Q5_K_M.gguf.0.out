A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). At -12 degrees Celsius, water is in a frozen state, but it is not at its freezing point.

B) If you cool down a glass of pure water to -12 degrees Celsius, it will remain in a frozen state. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, so at -12 degrees Celsius, it is well below the freezing point. Therefore, the water will remain frozen until it is heated above 0 degrees Celsius. [end of text]
