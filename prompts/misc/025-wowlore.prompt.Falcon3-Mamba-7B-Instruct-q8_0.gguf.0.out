Certainly! Here's a list of places in the original vanilla World of Warcraft lore, starting with "A" and going through the alphabet:

A - Azeroth
B - Blackrock Mountain
C - The Dark Portal (not a place, but a portal)
D - Durotar (Orgrimmar's location)
E - Elwynn Forest
F - Frostfire Ridge
G - Grommash Hold
H - Howling Basin
I - Ironforge
J - Jorgrim's Rest (a small village)
K - Kalimdor (the continent)
L - Loch Modan
M - Mulgore (the desert)
N - Northshire Valley
O - Outland (the portal, not a place)
P - Plaguelands
Q - Quel'Thalas (the Alliance's forest)
R - Ratchet (a small town)
S - Stranglethorn Vale
T - The Barrens
U - Undercity (Orgrimmar's underground)
V - Vashj'ir (a Zandalari city)
W - Winterspring (an Alliance city)
X - Xavarn (a Zandalari city)
Y - Yavniel (a Zandalari city)
Z - Zangarmarsh (an Alliance city)

Please note that some of these locations are not standalone places but are part of larger areas or cities. Also, "Outland" and "The Dark Portal" are portals rather than physical locations on the map. The vanilla WoW lore is rich with many more locations, but these are the ones that start with each letter of the alphabet. [end of text]
