Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Give me your interpretation. You do not have to translate the contents, but you may if you wish.

What a delightful set of lyrics! Based on the content and the described lighthearted, slightly mischievous melody, here's my interpretation of the story the lyrics tell, aiming for at least one literal sense within a fantastical setting:

**Setting:** A whimsical, possibly enchanted forest with a small, peculiar restaurant hidden within it.

**Story Interpretation:**

The lyrics describe a visit to this "森の小さなレストラン" (forest's small restaurant), where the narrator, possibly with an empty pocket (空っぽのポケット), stumbles upon the place as if led by forgotten memories or instincts (忘れた人から辿り着く). Despite the lack of reservations, the restaurant is surprisingly empty during lunchtime, with birds mocking the situation (小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる).

**The Restaurant's Quirk:**
- The restaurant has a distinctive red-painted tin roof (真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根) and a menu that only features recommended dishes (メニューはおすすめ そればかり).
- The kitchen is alive with music (バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ), suggesting a magical or enchanted culinary experience.

**The Experience:**
- Upon arrival, guests are warmly welcomed (ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい) and invited to eat to their heart's content, then sleep (たらふく食べたらお眠りよ), implying a satisfying, perhaps spellbinding meal.
- The farewell message (それでは皆さんさようなら) is followed by a hint that tomorrow will be different (明日は明日で エトセトラ), possibly indicating the restaurant's ephemeral nature.

**The Fantastical Twist:**
- The right-to-left chaos (右から左へおおわらわ) unleashes a joyful dance, even involving a bear cub (手乗りの子熊も踊り出す), highlighting the restaurant's magical atmosphere.
- The menu items (カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル / リゾット) are listed, with a notable absence of desserts (デザートはありません), leading to the final, enigmatic offer to deliver the "last full course" even to one's grave (お墓の中まで届けましょう / 今宵は最後のフルコース).

**Literal Interpretation within a Fantastical Setting:**
In a world where magical restaurants can exist hidden within forests, this place might be a nexus for forgotten memories and desires. The "last full course" could literally be a final, transcendent dining experience that the restaurant offers, not just as a metaphor for life's last meal, but as an actual, otherworldly service—to guide spirits to the afterlife with full bellies and happy hearts, encapsulating the essence of the restaurant's magical hospitality.

**Translation for Context (if desired):**

  - Can't find it even by tracing acorns / A small forest restaurant
  - Playing with empty pockets / Arrived by following forgotten people
  - No reservations at all / A small forest restaurant
  - Empty seats everywhere at lunchtime / Small birds laughing

- **Second Verse:**
  - Bright red painted tin roof / Menu is all recommendations
  - Violin, Flute, Cello, Viola sounds from the kitchen
- **Third Verse:**
  - Welcome, welcome, please come in / Eat till full, then sleep
  - Farewell, everyone, see you later / Tomorrow is another day, etc.
- **Fourth Verse:**
  - Chaos from right to left / Even a bear cub on someone's hands starts dancing
  - Carpaccio, Paella, Hors d'oeuvre / Risotto, No desserts
  - Shall we deliver to your grave? / Tonight, the last full course. [end of text]
