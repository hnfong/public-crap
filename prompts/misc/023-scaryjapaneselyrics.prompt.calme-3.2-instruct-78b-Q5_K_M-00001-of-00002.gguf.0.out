In a whimsical, almost surreal setting, the song seems to be about a hidden, almost mythical, restaurant located deep in a forest. The restaurant is so elusive that one can't find it by following acorns (ドングリを辿っても着きません) or by conventional means, but only by a path discovered by those who have forgotten something or someone. 

The restaurant is not busy, as it has no reservations (予約は一つもありません) and is filled with empty seats during lunchtime, which might be a humorous way to suggest it's not well-known or visited. The birds' laughter (小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる) could be a playful, lighthearted touch, or it could suggest a sense of mockery or irony.

The restaurant has a bright red tin roof (真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根) and a menu that only offers recommendations, suggesting a place that doesn't conform to the usual rules. The kitchen is filled with the sounds of a violin, flute, cello, and viola, which could be a metaphor for the harmonious, musical atmosphere or a literal depiction of a restaurant where music is as important as food.

The lyrics "ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい" and "それでは皆さんさようなら" are a welcoming and a farewell, respectively, suggesting the cyclical nature of the restaurant's operation or the transient nature of its guests. 

The phrase "明日は明日で エトセトラ" could be a philosophical touch, suggesting that each day is its own entity, and life goes on, or it could be a more literal depiction of the restaurant's operation, suggesting that it's open only on certain days.

In the latter part of the song, the restaurant's atmosphere becomes more lively, with a dancing cub (手乗りの子熊も踊り出す) and a variety of dishes being served, from Carpaccio, Paella, and hors d'oeuvres to risotto, but no dessert. The final line "お墓の中まで届けましょう 今宵は最後のフルコース" could be a metaphor for the restaurant's ability to reach the deepest, most hidden parts of one's being, or it could be a literal depiction of a restaurant that serves its last full course to the dead, suggesting a place that transcends life and death. 

In essence, the song seems to be about a restaurant that exists on the fringes of reality, a place that's both welcoming and mysterious, a place that's more than just a physical location, but a state of mind or a journey. [end of text]
