Translation:
Once upon a time, three little pigs set out to seek their fortunes and build their own homes. The first little pig built a house of straw, the second a house of sticks, and the third a house of bricks.

A big bad wolf came upon the first little pig's house and said, "Little pig, little pig, let me come in." But the little pig replied, "Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!" The wolf then huffed and puffed and blew the house of straw down. The first little pig ran to the second little pig's house, and they both refused to let the wolf in. The wolf huffed and puffed and blew the house of sticks down, too.

The two little pigs ran to the third little pig's house of bricks, and all three little pigs refused to let the wolf in. The wolf huffed and puffed, but he could not blow the house of bricks down. Frustrated, the wolf decided to climb down the chimney to catch the little pigs. However, the third little pig had a pot of water boiling over the fire. The wolf fell into the pot and was cooked.

The three little pigs celebrated their victory over the wolf, and they all lived together in the house of bricks, safe from the wolf's huffing and puffing. The end. [end of text]
