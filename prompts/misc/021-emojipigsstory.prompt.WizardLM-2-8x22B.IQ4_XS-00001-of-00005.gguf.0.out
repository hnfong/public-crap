Translation:
Once upon a time, three little pigs set out to seek their fortunes and build their own homes. The first little pig built a house of straw, the second a house of sticks, and the third a house of bricks.

A big bad wolf came upon the first little pig's house and said, "Little pig, little pig, let me come in." But the little pig replied, "Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!" The wolf then huffed and puffed and blew the house of straw down. The first little pig ran to the second little pig's house, and they both refused to let the wolf in. The wolf huffed and puffed and blew the house of sticks down, too.

The two little pigs ran to the third little pig's house of bricks, and all three little pigs refused to let the wolf in. The wolf huffed and puffed, but he could not blow the house of bricks down. Frustrated, the wolf tried to climb down the chimney, but the clever little pigs boiled a pot of water, and when the wolf fell in, he decided that pigs were not worth the trouble and ran away.

The three little pigs lived happily ever after in their strong brick house, knowing that hard work and intelligence had saved them from the wolf. And the moral of the story is that taking the time to do things right pays off in the end.
