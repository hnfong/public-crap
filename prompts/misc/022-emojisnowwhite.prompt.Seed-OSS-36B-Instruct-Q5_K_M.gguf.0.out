Got it, let's tackle this. The user wants a Snow White story told exclusively in emoji. First, I need to recall the classic elements: Snow White, the Evil Queen, the forest, the seven dwarfs, true love's kiss. But also allow creativity.

Start with Snow White in the forest, maybe fleeing the Queen. Need to set the scene: forest emojis like 🌳🍂🐿️. Then the dwarfs' cottage: 🧱🏠🚪 with little details like 🔨🛠️ for their tools. Maybe show her hiding, then the dwarfs coming home: 🧝♂️🧝♂️🧝♂️🧝♂️🧝♂️🧝♂️🧝♂️ (seven of them). Their reaction: 😮🙌 maybe 🥰.

Then the Queen finding out she's alive, getting the poison apple: 🍎💉🔮 (the Queen using her magic mirror). The Queen disguising herself: 🎭👵 (old lady). Giving the apple: 🍎➡️👸. Snow White taking a bite: 👄🍎 then 🥀💤 (falling asleep).

The dwarfs finding her: 😱😭, maybe trying to wake her: 👋💤➡️❌. Then the prince arriving: 🤴🏇 (on a horse). True love's kiss: 💋👸, Snow White waking up: ✨🌸🥰. Happy ending: 👸🤴🧝♂️✖️7🏰🌼.

Need to make sure the flow is clear with emojis. Connect each scene: fleeing, cottage, dwarfs, Queen's plan, apple, sleep, prince, kiss, happy ending. Add some details to make it creative, maybe the dwarfs have little names or hobbies? Like 🔧📚🎨 for different skills. Maybe Snow White singing: 🎤🎶 in the forest. The Queen's mirror: 🪞🔮❌👸 when she asks "who's the fairest?"

Check that all classic elements are there but with emoji creativity. Avoid text, only emojis. Make sure the sequence makes sense visually. Let me structure it step by step:

1. Snow White fleeing the Queen: 👸💢🔪➡️👸♀️💨🌳🍂 (Snow White running into forest)
2. Forest scene: 🌳🌿🐇🐿️🎤🎶 (Snow White singing, peaceful)
3. Finding the cottage: 🧱🏠🚪🔒❌ (door locked, she peeks in)
4. Inside the cottage: 🥣🍞🍯🛏️ (little beds, food) she eats, rests: 😊💤
5. Dwarfs coming home: 🧝♂️🔨➡️🚪🔑🔓 (one by one, using keys)
6. Dwarfs' reaction: 😮🙈🙉🙊 (surprised, maybe playful) then 🥰🤗 (happy)
7. Queen consulting mirror: 🪞🔮❓"Who's the fairest?" 🪞❌👸♀️💢 (mirror says Snow White)
8. Queen making poison apple: 🍎💉🔮🧪 (mixing poison) 🎭👵 (disguising)
9. Queen approaching: 👵🍎➡️👸♀️ (asks for help, gives apple)
10. Snow White biting: 👄🍎😋➡️🥀💤 (face turns pale, falls asleep)
11. Dwarfs finding her: 🧝♂️♂️♂️♂️♂️♂️♂️😱💔 (crying, panicked)
12. Prince arriving: 🤴🏇✨ (on white horse, glowing)
13. Prince kissing: 💋👸♀️➡️✨🌸 (Snow White wakes, blooms)
14. Happy ending: 👸♀️🤴🧝♂️✖️7🏰🌼🎉 (wedding, together)

Add some creative touches: maybe Snow White has a flower crown: 👸♀️🌸👑. Dwarfs have different tools: 🔧📚🎨🎷🔑📝🛠️. The forest has bioluminescence: 🌳✨. The Queen's anger: 🔥💢🔪. The poison apple has a red stem with a dark spot: 🍎🔴⚫. The prince's sword: 🗡️✨ (magic). Make sure each emoji connects logically. Avoid clutter, keep the story flowing. Check that it's understandable even with just emojis. Yeah, that should work.</seed:think>🌳🍂💨—👸♀️🌸👑（Snow White）flees 👸💢🔪（Evil Queen）into the woods.
