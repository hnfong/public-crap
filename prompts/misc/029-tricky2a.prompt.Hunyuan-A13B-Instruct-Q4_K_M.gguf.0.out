Both Alice and Bob are correct, but they are referring to different aspects of the situation.

- **Alice** is correct in stating that the freezing point of water is **0 degrees Celsius** under standard atmospheric pressure. This is the temperature at which water transitions from a liquid to a solid (ice) in normal conditions.

- **Bob** is also correct because water can still freeze at a temperature below 0 degrees Celsius, depending on the conditions. For example, if the air temperature is -10 degrees Celsius, the water will eventually freeze over time, even though the freezing point itself is 0 degrees Celsius.

In short, Alice is referring to the **freezing point**, while Bob is referring to the **behavior of water in a sub-zero environment**.
