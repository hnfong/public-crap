To determine the optimal play for both players in this situation, we need to consider the available options and the game mechanics involved. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. Alice has two copies of 'Kindle' in her hand, and she wants to kill Orim. Since Orim is a legendary creature, Alice can only have one copy of 'Kindle' in play at a time. Therefore, she needs to decide whether to cast one 'Kindle' and then the other, or to cast both at the same time.

2. When Alice casts a spell, it goes on the stack and waits for priority to pass. This means that if Alice casts one 'Kindle' and then the other, they will resolve in the order they were cast. This is important because Orim's ability prevents the first 3 damage dealt to any target each turn, and then any additional damage is lethal to Orim.

3. If Alice casts both 'Kindle' at the same time, they will resolve simultaneously. This means that Orim's ability will prevent the first 3 damage from one 'Kindle', but not from the other. In this case, Orim will take 4 damage (2 from the first 'Kindle' and 2 from the second) and be destroyed.

4. However, if Alice casts one 'Kindle' and then the other, Orim's ability will prevent the first 3 damage from the first 'Kindle', but not from the second. In this case, Orim will take 2 damage (1 from the first 'Kindle' and 1 from the second) and be destroyed. This is the optimal play for Alice, as it ensures that Orim is killed with the least amount of damage possible.

5. As for Bob, he has no cards in hand and no options to interact with the game state. Therefore, he cannot prevent Orim from being killed by Alice's 'Kindle' spells.

In conclusion, the optimal play for Alice is to cast one 'Kindle' and then the other, ensuring that Orim is killed with the least amount of damage possible. Bob has no options to interact with the game state and cannot prevent Orim from being killed.
