Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is right in the context he's using. While it's true that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under normal atmospheric pressure, Bob's statement is correct because he is implicitly referring to the process of water turning from liquid to solid (freezing) starting at around -10 degrees Celsius, which is a common range for this transition to become noticeable, depending on conditions. Alice is correct in stating the standard freezing point, but Bob's statement, though phrased ambiguously, can be interpreted as referring to the general range where water, especially with impurities or under specific conditions, would start to freeze. In everyday terms, saying water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius conveys that it will be solid at such temperatures, which is accurate for most practical purposes. [end of text]
