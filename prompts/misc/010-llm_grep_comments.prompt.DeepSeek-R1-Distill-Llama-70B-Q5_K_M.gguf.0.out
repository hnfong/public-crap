Okay, so I need to figure out how to perform a semantic "grep" on the given input based on the query. The query is asking for all lines with comments. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should understand what a comment is in this context. In shell scripts, comments typically start with a '#' symbol and continue to the end of the line. So, any line that has a '#' followed by some text is a comment line.

Looking at the input provided, I'll go through each line one by one.

Line 1: It starts with #!/bin/bash, which is a shebang line. Although it starts with '#', it's not a comment in the traditional sense but part of the script's metadata. However, some might consider it a comment. I'm a bit unsure here, but I think it's better to include it since it does start with '#'.

Line 2: set -ex. This is a command, not a comment.

Line 3: Empty line, so nothing here.

Line 4: Starts with '# Save the path...'. Clearly a comment.

Line 5: A command, not a comment.

Line 6: Another command.

Line 7: Empty.

Line 8: Function definition, not a comment.

Lines 9-13: Commands inside the function.

Line 14: Empty.

Line 15: Starts with '# This is a script...'. Definitely a comment.

Lines 16-27: Commands and function calls, not comments.

Line 28: Empty.

Line 29: Starts with '# Download and build...'. Comment.

Lines 30-36: Commands.

Line 37: Empty.

Line 38: Comment about libevent.

Lines 39-45: Commands.

Line 46: Empty.

Line 47: Comment about utf8proc.

Lines 48-54: Commands.

Line 55: Empty.

Line 56: Comment about tmux.

Lines 57-63: Commands.

Line 64: Empty.

Line 65: A command, not a comment.

So, the lines that are comments are lines 1, 4, 15, 29, 38, 47, 56. Wait, line 1 is the shebang. Should that be included? The user's example output includes line 1, so I think it's acceptable to include it as a comment line.

Therefore, the output should include lines 1,4,15,29,38,47,56, each followed by '---'.
