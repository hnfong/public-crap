Okay, the user wants a story about Snow White using only emojis. Let me start by recalling the classic elements: Snow White, the evil queen, the mirror, the huntsman, the dwarfs, the poisoned apple, the prince, etc. But they want some creativity.

First, I need to make sure the story flows and each emoji represents a part of the narrative. Let me break it down into scenes. Start with Snow White in the forest, maybe with a mirror. The queen should be the antagonist, so perhaps a crown emoji. The mirror could be a reflection or a mirror emoji. The huntsman might be represented by an axe or a forest creature. The dwarfs could be multiple emojis like construction symbols or just different emojis for each. The poisoned apple is crucial, maybe a red apple with a bite. The prince could be a prince emoji or a knight. The ending should have the prince saving her, maybe a kiss and a happy family.

Wait, need to check if all emojis are appropriate and tell the story clearly. Maybe start with Snow White (snow + white? Or just a princess emoji?), the evil queen (crown, maybe a face with a devil?), the mirror (reflection, or a glass?), the huntsman (axe, forest), the dwarfs (multiple emojis like mountain, pickaxe, etc.), the apple, the prince (knight, prince), and the happy ending (family, flowers, rainbow). 

Also, the user said the protagonist must resemble the classical tale but allow creativity. Maybe add some unique elements, like different dwarfs with varied emojis, or the queen using a different method. But stick to the main plot. Ensure the emojis are in order and each represents a part of the story without being confusing. Let me draft a sequence and see if it makes sense. Maybe start with 🌳❄️ (forest and snow), then 👗 (clothes?), but maybe not. Alternatively, 👸 (queen) first? No, the queen is the antagonist, so maybe start with Snow White entering the forest. Use 🍄 for mushrooms, maybe. Then the queen with a mirror 🕵️👑🪞. Then the huntsman with an axe 🎯🤴. Dwarfs 🏔️💪 (mountain and strong), then the apple 🍎🍎 (poisoned), then the prince 👑💋, and the happy ending 🌈❤️✨. 

Wait, need to make sure each emoji transitions smoothly. Maybe:

Start with Snow White in the forest, maybe 🌳❄️👸. The queen 👑🔥 (crazy queen?), using a mirror 🪞. The huntsman 🎯🤴 takes her to the dwarfs 🏔️💪. The queen gives the poisoned apple 🍎🍎. Snow White falls, maybe 😖❄️. The dwarfs find her, 🏔️❤️. Prince comes, saves her 👑💋. Happy ending 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦. 

Hmm, maybe adjust. Let me try again. The key points: Snow White, evil queen, mirror, huntsman, dwarfs, poisoned apple, sleeping, prince waking her. Each step needs an emoji. Let's map each part:

1. Snow White in the forest: 🌳👸 (forest and princess)
2. Evil queen: 👑🔥 (queen with fire? Maybe 👾👑 for a TV queen? Or 👿👑)
3. Mirror: 🪞 (mirror emoji)
4. Queen asks the mirror: 🪞👑 (mirror and queen)
5. Mirror lies: 🚫👑 (no queen) or maybe 🍎 (apple idea comes here)
Wait, maybe the mirror says "Reflection is better" or something. Maybe 🌟🪞 (star and mirror). Then the queen decides to make a poison apple. 🍎➡️👑 (apple to queen). Then the huntsman takes Snow White to the dwarfs. 🎯👸➡️🐻‍❄️ (huntsman takes her to dwarfs). The dwarfs take care of her. 🏔️❄️🐻‍❄️ (mountain, snow, dwarfs). The queen tries to kill her with the apple. 🍎👑 (apple and queen). Snow White eats it, falls asleep. 😖🍎 (sad apple). Prince arrives, wakes her up. 👑💋👸 (prince kiss). They live happily. 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦. 

I think that's a rough outline. Now, need to string the emojis in order without repeating too much. Maybe:

🌳👸 👑🔥🪞 🍎➡️👑 🎯🐻‍❄️ 👑💋 😖🍎 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦

Wait, maybe more precise steps. Let's structure each part step by step:

1. Snow White in the forest: 🌳👸
2. Evil queen: 👾👑 (maybe a TV queen emoji? Or 👿👑)
3. Mirror: 🪞
4. Queen asks the mirror: 🪞👑
5. Mirror lies: 🚫👑 (no, maybe the mirror says "Your beauty is surpassed by this one" but emojis... maybe 🌟👸 (beautiful princess) vs 🍎 (apple)
6. Queen makes poison apple: 🍎➡️👑 (apple to queen)
7. Huntsman takes Snow White to the forest: 🎯👸➡️🐻‍❄️ (huntsman with arrow takes her to snow dwarf?)
8. Dwarfs find her: 🏔️🐻‍❄️ (mountain and dwarfs)
9. Queen gives poisoned apple: 🍎👑 (apple and queen)
10. Snow White eats it: 🍎👸 (apple and princess)
11. She falls asleep: 😖💤 (sad and sleeping)
12. Prince arrives: 👑💋 (prince kiss)
13. Happy ending: 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦

Hmm, maybe that works. Let me check if the emojis flow naturally. Also, need to ensure that each emoji is clearly representing the action. Maybe use 🕵️ for the queen as a spy or evil character. 👟 for the huntsman? Or maybe 🎯 for target/hunting. 

Alternatively, use 👸 for Snow White, 👿 for the evil queen. Then 🪞 for the mirror. The huntsman could be 🏔️ (mountain man?) or 🏔️❄️ (snowman). The dwarfs could be 🐾❄️ (animal and snow?), but there are seven dwarfs, maybe use multiple emojis like ⏰💪 (different traits). But maybe just 🏔️🐻 (mountain and bear) for simplicity. 

The poisoned apple is crucial. Maybe use 🍎🍎 (two apples) to show it's poisoned. Then the prince is 👑, and the happy ending with family. 

Putting it all together:

👸 (Snow White) 🌳 (forest) 👿👑 (evil queen) 🪞 (mirror) 🍎➡️ (queen gives apple) 🎯 (huntsman) 🏔️🐻 (dwarfs) 😖🍎 (Snow White eats) 👑💋 (prince wakes her) 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦 (happy ending)

Wait, maybe the order needs to be more precise. Let's try:

1. Snow White in the forest: 🌳👸
2. Evil queen: 👿👑
3. Mirror: 🪞
4. Queen asks mirror: 🪞👑
5. Mirror says Snow White is prettier: 🌟👸 > 🍎 (so queen makes apple)
6. Huntsman takes Snow White to dwarfs: 🎯👸➡️🐻‍❄️ (huntsman with arrow takes her to snow dwarf)
7. Dwarfs care for her: 🏔️❄️🐻‍❄️
8. Queen poisons her with apple: 🍎👑
9. Snow White falls asleep: 😖🍎
10. Prince arrives and wakes her: 👑💋👸
11. Happy ending: 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦

But need to represent each step with emojis without words. Maybe:

🌳👸 👿👑🪞 🍎➡️👑 🎯🐻‍❄️ 👑💋 😖🍎 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦

Wait, that skips some steps. Maybe add the huntsman taking her to the dwarfs: 🎯👸➡️🐻‍❄️. Then the dwarfs taking care: 🏔️🐻‍❄️. Then queen gives apple: 🍎👑. Then Snow White eats: 🍎👸. Then sleeps: 😖💤. Prince comes: 👑💋. Then happy ending.

So combining:

🌳👸 👿👑🪞 🍎➡️👑 🎯👸➡️🐻‍❄️ 🏔️🐻‍❄️ 😖💤🍎 👑💋 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦

But maybe the arrows are hard to represent. Maybe use ➔ for actions. But emojis don't have arrows. Maybe just sequence them.

Alternatively:

👸 (Snow) 🌳 (forest) 👿👑 (queen) 🪞 (mirror) 🍎➡️ (queen to apple) 🎯 (huntsman) 🏔️🐻 (dwarfs) 😖 (Snow) 🍎 (apple) 👑💋 (prince) 🌈❤️ (happily)

Hmm, not sure. Maybe need to adjust. Let's try again step by step:

1. Snow White in the forest: 🌳👸
2. Evil queen: 👿👑
3. Mirror: 🪞
4. Queen asks mirror: 🪞👑
5. Mirror lies: 🌟👸 > 🍎 (queen decides to make apple)
6. Huntsman takes Snow to dwarfs: 🎯👸➡️🐻‍❄️ (huntsman with arrow takes her to snow dwarf)
7. Dwarfs find her: 🏔️🐻‍❄️
8. Queen gives poisoned apple: 🍎👑
9. Snow eats: 🍎👸
10. She sleeps: 😖💤
11. Prince wakes her: 👑💋
12. Happy ending: 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦

But translating each step into emojis without words. Maybe:

🌳👸 👿👑🪞 🍎➡️👑 🎯🐻‍❄️👉🐻‍❄️ 😖🍎 👑💋 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦

But the arrows are tricky. Maybe just list them in order:

👸 (Snow) 🌳 (forest) 👿👑 (queen) 🪞 (mirror) 🍎➡️ (queen to apple) 🎯 (huntsman) 🏔️🐻 (dwarfs) 😖 (Snow) 🍎 (apple) 👑 (prince) 💋 (kiss) 🌈 (rainbow) ❤️ (love) ✨ (magic) 👨👩👧👦 (family)

That might work. Let me check if the sequence makes sense. Snow in the forest, evil queen, mirror, poisoned apple, huntsman, dwarfs, Snow eats apple, prince saves, happy family. Yes. Maybe add some more emojis for the dwarfs, like different ones: ⏰, 💪, 🧊, etc. But maybe keep it simple. Also, the evil queen could be 👾👑 (TV queen) instead of 👿👑, but 👿 might be too explicit. Maybe 👷🔥 (queen burning?) Not sure. Alternatively, 👸🔥 (queen in fire) but that's not accurate. Maybe just 👿👑 is better, even if it's a bit harsh. 

Alternatively, use 👵👑 for the old queen. 👵 is the elderly woman, 👗 is the queen's attire. But 👵👑 might be clearer. So maybe 👵👑 for the evil queen. Then the mirror 🪞. The apple 🍎. Huntsman 🎯. Dwarfs 🏔️🐻. 

So revised sequence:

👸 🌳 👵👑 🪞 🍎➡️ 👯♂️箭头👉🐻‍❄️ 😖🍎 👑💋 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦

But the arrow emoji is not standard. Maybe use ➔ instead of arrow. But not sure if that's allowed. Alternatively, just put them in order without arrows. 

Another approach: Use emojis that imply the actions. For example, after the queen and mirror, the apple is given to the huntsman? Or the queen gives the apple to Snow. So maybe:

👸 (Snow) 🌳 (forest) 👵👑 (queen) 🪞 (mirror) 🍎 (apple) 👯♂️ (huntsman) 🏔️🐻 (dwarfs) 😖 (Snow) 👑💋 (prince) 🌈 (happy)

But need to clarify the poisoned aspect. Maybe use a red apple 🍎, and a skull 💀 for poison? But that might be too dark. Alternatively, two apples 🍎🍎. 

So putting it all together:

👸 🌳 👵👑 🪞 🍎🍎 👯♂️ 🏔️🐻 😖 👑💋 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦

But the sequence would be: Snow in the forest, evil queen, mirror, two poisoned apples, huntsman, dwarfs, Snow is sad, prince kisses her, happy ending. That works. Maybe add the sleeping emoji 😴 instead of 😖, but 😖 conveys sadness. 

Alternatively, after the apples, Snow eats them and falls asleep: 😴🍎. Then prince wakes her. 

So:

👸 🌳 👵👑 🪞 🍎🍎 👯♂️ 🏔️🐻 😴🍎 👑💋 😇 👌✨🌈👨👩👧👦

But the prince emoji is 👑, then a kiss 💋, then Snow awake 😇, then happy family. 

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Let me try to finalize the sequence with the most logical flow using only necessary emojis. The key is to use emojis that clearly represent each step without needing explanation. 

Final attempt:

👸 (Snow) 🌳 (forest) 👵👑 (queen) 🪞 (mirror) 🍎➡️ (queen gives apple) 🎯 (huntsman) 🏔️🐻 (dwarfs) 😖 (Snow) 🍎 (apple) 👑💋 (prince) 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦 (happy ending)

But the arrow might not be necessary. Maybe just:

👸 🌳 👵👑 🪞 🍎 👯♂️ 🏔️🐻 😖 🍎 👑💋 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦

But that skips the huntsman taking her to the dwarfs. Maybe include 🎯 (hunting) between 👯♂️ and 🏔️🐻. 

Alternatively:

👸 🌳 👵👑 🪞 🍎 👯♂️箭头👉 🏔️🐻 😖 🍎 👑💋 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦

But without arrow emojis, maybe use ➔ or just sequence them. 

Alternatively, use 👯♂️👸 (huntsman and princess) together to show them going to the dwarfs. 

So:

👸 🌳 👵👑 🪞 🍎 👯♂️👸 🏔️🐻 😖 🍎 👑💋 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦

This shows Snow in the forest, queen, mirror, apple, huntsman takes her, dwarfs, she's sad, eats apple, prince saves, happy ending. 

But maybe the dwarfs should be represented by multiple emojis, like ⏰💪 (clock and strong) for different dwarfs, but that complicates. Alternatively, use 🐾❄️ (animal and snow) for dwarfs. 

Alternatively, use 🏔️❄️ (mountain snow) to represent the dwarfs' home. 

But perhaps the simplest way is to use 🏔️🐻 (mountain and bear) to represent the dwarfs. 

Putting it all together:

👸 🌳 👵👑 🪞 🍎 👯♂️ 🏔️🐻 😖 🍎 👑💋 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦

This seems to capture the main points. Let me check again:

1. Snow in the forest (👸 🌳)
2. Evil queen ( 👵👑)
3. Mirror (🪞)
4. Queen gives poisoned apple (🍎)
5. Huntsman takes Snow to dwarfs (👑 👯♂️ 🏔️🐻?) Wait, maybe the sequence is 👵👑 gives apple to 👯♂️, who takes Snow to 🏔️🐻. So:

👸 🌳 👵👑 🪞 🍎 👯♂️ 🏔️🐻 😖 🍎 👑💋 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦

Hmm, the flow is: Snow in the forest, queen, mirror, apple, huntsman, dwarfs, Snow sad, apple, prince, happy. Maybe the second apple is redundant. Maybe just one apple, but need to show it's poisoned. Maybe use 💀 (skull) for poison, but that's dark. Alternatively, two apples 🍎🍎. 

Alternatively, 👵👑 🪞 🍎 (queen uses mirror to make apple). Then 👯♂️ takes Snow to 🏔️🐻. Snow eats 🍎, sleeps, prince wakes her, happy ending. 

So:

👸 🌳 👵👑 🪞 🍎 👯♂️ 🏔️🐻 😖 👑💋 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦

But where is the eating? Maybe 😖 implies she's sad because she ate the apple. So sequence would be:

1. Snow in the forest (👸 🌳)
2. Queen with mirror ( 👵👑 🪞)
3. Queen makes poisoned apple ( 🍎)
4. Huntsman takes Snow to dwarfs ( 👯♂️ 🏔️🐻)
5. Snow eats apple ( 😖 🍎)
6. Prince saves her ( 👑💋)
7. Happy ending ( 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦)

Yes, that works. Each emoji represents a step. The 👵👑 is the evil queen, 🪞 is the mirror, 🍎 is the poisoned apple, 👯♂️ is the huntsman, 🏔️🐻 are the dwarfs, 😖 is Snow's sadness after eating, 👑💋 is the prince waking her up, and the happy family. 

I think this sequence works. Let me verify again:

- 👸 🌳: Snow White in the forest.
- 👵👑 🪞: Evil queen with the magic mirror.
- 🍎: Poisoned apple.
- 👯♂️ 🏔️🐻: Huntsman takes her to the dwarfs (mountain and bear emojis for dwarfs).
- 😖 🍎: Snow eats the apple and is sad (asleep).
- 👑💋: Prince wakes her with a kiss.
- 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦: Happy ending with family.

Yes, that seems to capture the story. The emojis are clear and follow the plot. Some might interpret the emojis differently, but given the classic story, this should be understandable. The creativity comes from the choice of emojis for characters and events, like using 👵👑 for the queen and 🏔️🐻 for the dwarfs. 

Final check: All emojis, no text. Yes. The story flows logically. Each step is represented. The protagonist is Snow White as in the classic tale, but the emojis add a unique twist. This should meet the user's requirements.
