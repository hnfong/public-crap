Okay, the user wants a story about Snow White using only emojis. Let me start by recalling the classic elements: Snow White, the evil queen, the mirror, the huntsman, the dwarfs, the poisoned apple, the prince, etc. But they want some creativity.

First, I need to make sure the story flows and each emoji represents a part of the narrative. Let me break it down into scenes. Start with Snow White in the forest, maybe with a mirror. The queen should be the antagonist, so perhaps a crown emoji. The mirror could be a reflection or a mirror emoji. The huntsman might be represented by an axe or a forest creature. The dwarfs could be multiple emojis like construction symbols or just different emojis for each. The poisoned apple is crucial, maybe a red apple with a bite. The prince could be a prince emoji or a knight. The ending should have the prince saving her, maybe a kiss and a happy family.

Wait, need to check if all emojis are appropriate and tell the story clearly. Maybe start with Snow White (snow + white? Or just a princess emoji?), the evil queen (crown, maybe a face with a devil?), the mirror (reflection, or a glass?), the huntsman (axe, forest), the dwarfs (multiple emojis like mountain, pickaxe, etc.), the apple, the prince (knight, prince), and the happy ending (family, flowers, rainbow). 

Also, the user said the protagonist must resemble the classical tale but allow creativity. Maybe add some unique elements, like different dwarfs with varied emojis, or the queen using a different method. But stick to the main plot. Ensure the emojis are in order and each represents a part of the story without being confusing. Let me draft a sequence and see if it makes sense. Maybe start with 🌳❄️ (forest and snow), then 👗 (clothes?), but maybe not. Alternatively, 👸 (queen) first? No, the queen is the antagonist, so maybe start with Snow White entering the forest. Use 🍄 for mushrooms, maybe. Then the queen with a mirror 🕵️👑🪞. Then the huntsman with an axe 🎯🤴. Dwarfs 🏔️💪 (mountain and strong), then the apple 🍎🍎 (poisoned), then the prince 👑💋, and the happy ending 🌈❤️✨. 

Wait, need to make sure each emoji transitions smoothly. Maybe:

Start with Snow White in the forest, maybe 🌳❄️👸. The queen 👑🔥 (crazy queen?), using a mirror 🪞. The huntsman 🎯🤴 takes her to the dwarfs 🏔️💪. The queen gives the poisoned apple 🍎🍎. Snow White falls, maybe 😖❄️. The dwarfs find her, 🏔️❤️. Prince comes, saves her 👑💋. Happy ending 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦. 

Hmm, maybe adjust. Let me try again. The key points: Snow White, evil queen, mirror, huntsman, dwarfs, poisoned apple, sleeping, prince waking her. Each step needs an emoji. Let's map each part:

1. Snow White in the forest: 🌳👸 (forest and princess)
2. Evil queen: 👑🔥 (queen with fire? Maybe 👾👑 for a TV queen? Or 👿👑)
3. Mirror: 🪞 (mirror emoji)
4. Queen asks the mirror: 🪞👑 (mirror and queen)
5. Mirror lies: 🚫👑 (no queen) or maybe 🍎 (apple idea comes here)
Wait, maybe the mirror says "Reflection is better" or something. Maybe 🌟🪞 (star and mirror). Then the queen decides to make a poison apple. 🍎➡️👑 (apple to queen). Then the huntsman takes Snow White to the dwarfs. 🎯👸➡️🐻‍❄️ (huntsman takes her to dwarfs). The dwarfs take care of her. 🏔️❄️🐻‍❄️ (mountain, snow, dwarfs). The queen tries to kill her with the apple. 🍎👑 (apple and queen). Snow White eats it, falls asleep. 😖🍎 (sad apple). Prince arrives, wakes her up. 👑💋👸 (prince kiss). They live happily. 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦. 

I think that's a rough outline. Now, need to string the emojis in order without repeating too much. Maybe:

🌳👸 👑🔥🪞 🍎➡️👑 🎯🐻‍❄️ 👑💋 😖🍎 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦

Wait, maybe more precise steps. Let's structure each part step by step:

1. Snow White in the forest: 🌳👸
2. Evil queen: 👾👑 (maybe a TV queen emoji? Or 👿👑)
3. Mirror: 🪞
4. Queen asks the mirror: 🪞👑
5. Mirror lies: 🚫👑 (no, maybe the mirror says "Your beauty is surpassed by this one" but emojis... maybe 🌟👸 (beautiful princess) vs 🍎 (apple)
6. Queen makes poison apple: 🍎➡️👑 (apple to queen)
7. Huntsman takes Snow White to the forest: 🎯👸➡️🐻‍❄️ (huntsman with arrow takes her to snow dwarf?)
8. Dwarfs find her: 🏔️🐻‍❄️ (mountain and dwarfs)
9. Queen gives poisoned apple: 🍎👑 (apple and queen)
10. Snow White eats it: 🍎👸 (apple and princess)
11. She falls asleep: 😖💤 (sad and sleeping)
12. Prince arrives: 👑💋 (prince kiss)
13. Happy ending: 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦

Hmm, maybe that works. Let me check if the emojis flow naturally. Also, need to ensure that each emoji is clearly representing the action. Maybe use 🕵️ for the queen as a spy or evil character. 👟 for the huntsman? Or maybe 🎯 for target/hunting. 

Alternatively, use 👸 for Snow White, 👿 for the evil queen. Then 🪞 for the mirror. The huntsman could be 🏔️ (mountain man?) or 🏔️❄️ (snowman). The dwarfs could be 🐾❄️ (animal and snow?), but there are seven dwarfs, maybe use multiple emojis like ⏰💪 (different traits). But maybe just 🏔️🐻 (mountain and bear) for simplicity. 

The poisoned apple is crucial. Maybe use 🍎🍎 (two apples) to show it's poisoned. Then the prince is 👑, and the happy ending with family. 

Putting it all together:

👸 (Snow White) 🌳 (forest) 👿👑 (evil queen) 🪞 (mirror) 🍎➡️ (queen gives apple) 🎯 (huntsman) 🏔️🐻 (dwarfs) 😖🍎 (Snow White eats) 👑💋 (prince wakes her) 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦 (happy ending)

Wait, maybe the order needs to be more precise. Let's try:

1. Snow White in the forest: 🌳👸
2. Evil queen: 👿👑
3. Mirror: 🪞
4. Queen asks mirror: 🪞👑
5. Mirror says Snow White is prettier: 🌟👸 > 🍎 (so queen makes apple)
6. Huntsman takes Snow White to dwarfs: 🎯👸➡️🐻‍❄️ (huntsman with arrow takes her to snow dwarf)
7. Dwarfs care for her: 🏔️❄️🐻‍❄️
8. Queen poisons her with apple: 🍎👑
9. Snow White falls asleep: 😖🍎
10. Prince arrives and wakes her: 👑💋👸
11. Happy ending: 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦

But need to represent each step with emojis without words. Maybe:

🌳👸 👿👑🪞 🍎➡️👑 🎯🐻‍❄️ 👑💋 😖🍎 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦

Wait, that skips some steps. Maybe add the huntsman taking her to the dwarfs: 🎯👸➡️🐻‍❄️. Then the dwarfs taking care: 🏔️🐻‍❄️. Then queen gives apple: 🍎👑. Then Snow White eats: 🍎👸. Then sleeps: 😖💤. Prince comes: 👑💋. Then happy ending.

So combining:

🌳👸 👿👑🪞 🍎➡️👑 🎯👸➡️🐻‍❄️ 🏔️🐻‍❄️ 😖💤🍎 👑💋 🌈❤️✨👨👩👧👦

But maybe the arrows are hard to represent. Maybe use ➔ for actions. But emojis don't have arrows. Maybe just sequence them.

Alternatively:

👸 (Snow) 🌳 (forest) 👿👑 (
