Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Give me your interpretation. You do not have to translate the contents, but you may if you wish.
 [/INST] These lyrics seem to describe a whimsical and fantastical experience at a small restaurant in the forest.

The first two lines suggest that the speaker is trying to find the restaurant by following a dung beetle (ドングリ), but is unable to reach it. Once they arrive, they find that the restaurant has no reservations and empty pockets, but they are able to reach it from someone who has forgotten it.

The next few lines describe the atmosphere of the restaurant during lunchtime. The menu is limited to the chef's recommendations, and the sounds of various instruments being played in the kitchen can be heard. The speaker welcomes the guests and invites them to eat and fall asleep, before saying goodbye and telling them that tomorrow is another day.

The final stanza describes the restaurant's offerings as the speaker and their companions enjoy their last full course meal. They are served various dishes, including carpaccio, paella, and oyster, but there is no dessert. The speaker suggests that they deliver the dessert even to the graves in the forest.

Overall, the lyrics seem to describe a magical and slightly mischievous dining experience at a small, hidden restaurant in the forest. The lack of reservations and empty pockets suggest that the restaurant is not easily accessible, but the speaker is able to find it through some sort of supernatural means. The various dishes and instruments being played in the kitchen add to the fantastical atmosphere, and the final line about delivering dessert to the graves adds a touch of whimsy and playfulness.
