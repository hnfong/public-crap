Bob is right. While it's true that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, it can also freeze at temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius, such as -10 degrees Celsius. This is because the freezing point of water can be lowered by factors like pressure and the presence of impurities. So, at -10 degrees Celsius, water can indeed freeze. [end of text]
