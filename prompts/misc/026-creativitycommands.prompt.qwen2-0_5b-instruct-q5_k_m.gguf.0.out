I have written a fan fiction based on World of Warcraft characters. I saved the file into wowfanfic.txt

What is a probable output if I run this Linux command?

$ cat wowfanfic.txt | perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }' | sort |  uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 20

Explain your answer with respect to basic linguistic principles.

The Perl script you provided is a command-line tool that can be used to sort, count, and sort the unique characters in a given text file. The script is executed by running the command `perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }' and then piping it to the `sort` command, which sorts the characters in the output. The `uniq -c` command is used to count the number of occurrences of each character, and the `sort -n` command is used to sort the characters in descending order. Finally, the `tail -n 20` command is used to display the top 20 characters in the sorted order.

The output of the Perl script will be a list of unique characters from the `wowfanfic.txt` file, sorted by their frequency in descending order. The output will be in the format of a list of characters, with each character listed in alphabetical order. [end of text]
