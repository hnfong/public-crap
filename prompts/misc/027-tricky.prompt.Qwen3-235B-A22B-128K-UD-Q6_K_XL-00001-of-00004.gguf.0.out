A) **Yes, water freezes at -12 degrees Celsius.**  
Water typically freezes at 0°C under normal atmospheric pressure. At -12°C, which is well below the freezing point, water would definitely be in its solid state (ice), unless it is in a supercooled liquid state temporarily due to very controlled conditions.

B) **If pure water is cooled to -12°C, it will freeze.**  
Pure water will begin to freeze at 0°C. When cooled further to -12°C, the water will solidify into ice. The temperature of the ice will then continue to drop to match the surrounding temperature (-12°C), assuming it is in a stable environment. The process of freezing releases heat (latent heat of fusion), but once fully frozen, the ice will just get colder. [end of text]
