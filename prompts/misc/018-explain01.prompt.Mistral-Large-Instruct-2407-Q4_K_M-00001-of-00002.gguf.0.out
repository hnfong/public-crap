 Yo, listen up, let me break it down,
'Bout the Fed, the bank that runs the town.
They print the green, control the scene,
Make sure the economy stays lean and clean.

They got two main jobs, ain't no more,
Keep prices steady, make sure jobs grow.
They juggle interest rates, high and low,
To keep the money flow just right, not too slow.

When times are tough, they step in quick,
Lower rates, make loans less thick.
More cash in hand, people spend,
Businesses boom, recession end.

But when it's hot, and folks spend lots,
They raise the rates, cool down the spots.
Prices high, they bring 'em down,
Keep that inflation from wearing the crown.

They the referee, the money G,
Keep the economy on its feet, you see.
So next time you hear 'bout the Fed,
Remember they the ones keeping us ahead. [end of text]
