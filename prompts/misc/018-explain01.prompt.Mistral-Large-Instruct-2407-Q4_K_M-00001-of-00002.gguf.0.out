 Yo, listen up, let me break it down,
'Bout the Fed, the bank that's runnin' the town.
They print the green, control the scene,
Make sure the economy stays lean and clean.

They got two main jobs, ain't nothin' more,
Keep prices steady, make sure jobs don't bore.
They juggle interest rates, high and low,
Make money flow, help the dough grow.

When times are tough, they step in quick,
Lower the rates, make the market slick.
People spend more, businesses boom,
The economy's like a hot tune.

But when it's hot, too many spend,
Prices rise, that's the trend.
They raise the rates, make it cool,
Control inflation, that's the rule.

They the referee, callin' the shots,
Keep the economy from hittin' the rocks.
So there you have it, plain and clear,
That's the Fed, ain't nothin' to fear. [end of text]
