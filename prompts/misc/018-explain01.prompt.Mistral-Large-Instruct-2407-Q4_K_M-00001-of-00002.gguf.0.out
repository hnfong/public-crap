[INST] Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.
[/INST] 🎤Yo, listen up, let me break it down,
'Bout the Fed, the big player in our town,
They control the cash, make it flow or frown,
Their job's to keep the economy's crown.🎤

🎤They got two main goals, ain't nothing small,
Keep prices steady, make sure they don't fall,
Or rise too high, that's not cool at all,
And max employment, so we all can ball.🎤

🎤They raise or lower interest rates, feel me?
When rates are high, borrowing ain't easy,
People save more, spend less, it's breezy,
But low rates get that cash flowin', ain't it queasy?🎤

🎤They print money, but not like a counterfeiter,
Buy bonds, pump cash, act like a stimulator,
Or sell 'em off, when the economy's hotter,
It's all about balance, like a tightrope walker.🎤

🎤They the bank of banks, the big boss,
Hold reserves, lend a hand if there's a loss,
In a crisis, they step up, pay the cost,
The Fed's the lifeguard, so we ain't lost.🎤

🎤So there you have it, the Fed's the key,
To keep our economy strong and free,
They juggle and balance, one, two, three,
The Federal Reserve, that's the G.🎤
