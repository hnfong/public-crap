Answer the following questions with brief explanations.

A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?
B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?

A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) at standard atmospheric pressure.

B) If you cool down the glass of pure water to -12 degrees Celsius, it will not freeze. Water will remain in its liquid state until it reaches its freezing point of 0 degrees Celsius. At -12 degrees Celsius, the water will still be a liquid, but it will be very close to freezing. If you continue to cool it down, it will eventually reach its freezing point and freeze.
