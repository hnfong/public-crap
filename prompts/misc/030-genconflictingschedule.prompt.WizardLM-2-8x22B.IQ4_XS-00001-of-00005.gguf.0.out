Conflicts:
- The Tech Conference (Event 1) and the Salsa Party (Event 25) both occur on the same date, 2023-01-15, but the Salsa Party starts after the Tech Conference ends, so there is no direct conflict.
- The Charity Gala (Event 28) starts on 2021-12-31 and ends on 2022-01-01, which does not conflict with any other event directly but spans two days.

There are no direct conflicts (i.e., events that occur at the exact same time) in the list provided. However, if we consider venue conflicts or the availability of participants and organizers, there could be potential issues with events happening on the same day or in close succession. For example, someone interested in attending both the Art Exhibition (Event 2) and the Book Fair (Event 6) would not be able to do so on the same day, as they both occur on 2022-11-11. Similarly, organizers and staff might find it challenging to manage events that are close together in time, such as the Film Festival (Event 7) ending on 2024-03-25 and the Hackathon (Event 15) starting the next day on 2024-05-25.
