What a delightful and whimsical set of lyrics!

From my interpretation, the story appears to be set in a fantastical forest, where a small, mysterious restaurant exists. The lyrics describe a place that's hard to find, with an empty pocket and no reservations, but somehow, people stumble upon it. The atmosphere is lively, with birds chirping and laughing, and the sound of musical instruments (violin, flute, cello, and viola) coming from the kitchen.

The restaurant seems to be a magical, perhaps otherworldly, establishment, with a bright red tin roof and a menu that's full of recommendations. The staff welcomes customers with open arms, inviting them to eat to their heart's content and then take a nap. The lyrics also mention a "full course" meal, but with a twist: it's the "last" one, and it'll be delivered all the way to the customer's grave.

One possible interpretation is that this restaurant is a kind of "last stop" or a "final feast" for those who are about to embark on a great journey, perhaps to the afterlife. The "full course" meal is a sendoff, and the staff's warm welcome and invitation to eat and rest is a way of preparing the customers for their next great adventure.

In this fantastical setting, the lyrics make literal sense, and the story is not just metaphorical. The restaurant is a real, albeit magical, place where people can come to enjoy a final, unforgettable meal before moving on to whatever comes next.

The tone of the lyrics, with their lighthearted and mischievous melody, suggests that this "last stop" is not a somber or mournful place, but rather a celebratory one, where people can come to savor their last moments in this world and embark on their next journey with a full heart and a happy belly.
