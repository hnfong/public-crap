[INST] Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.
[/INST] 1. **Alice's Statement:**
   - Alice states that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.
   - This is a well-known fact in standard conditions (at sea level atmospheric pressure).

2. **Bob's Statement:**
   - Bob states that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius.
   - This statement is not accurate under standard conditions.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Under standard atmospheric pressure, water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.
   - However, water can remain liquid below 0 degrees Celsius if it is in a supercooled state, but this is not a stable condition and does not change the standard freezing point.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard conditions.
   - Bob is incorrect in stating that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius under standard conditions.

Therefore, Alice is right. [end of text]
