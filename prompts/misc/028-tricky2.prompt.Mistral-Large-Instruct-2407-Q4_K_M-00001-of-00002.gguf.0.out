 Bob is technically correct, but his statement is misleading. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. However, at -10 degrees Celsius, water is indeed frozen, so Bob's statement that "water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius" can be interpreted as true because water is in its frozen state at that temperature. Alice is also correct in stating that the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius. Therefore, both are right in different contexts, but Alice's statement is more precise regarding the freezing point. [end of text]
