 Bob is right in this context. While it's true that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure, if the temperature drops to -10 degrees Celsius, water will indeed be frozen. So, Bob's statement that "water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius" is correct because water would be in a frozen state at that temperature. Alice's statement is also correct in the general sense that the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius, but it doesn't contradict Bob's statement in the given context. [end of text]
