Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Alice is right. 

Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). Bob might be thinking about a different substance or a specific situation where water might freeze at a lower temperature due to impurities or pressure changes.
