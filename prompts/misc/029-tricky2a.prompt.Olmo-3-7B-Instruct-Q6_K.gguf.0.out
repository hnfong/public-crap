**Who is right?**

**Bob is right in context.** 

Here's why:

- **Freezing point of water at standard pressure is 0°C.** That's correct. At 0°C, pure water can remain in equilibrium between solid (ice) and liquid (water).
- However, **at temperatures below 0°C (like -10°C), water will freeze if it is in contact with a surface that can support ice and is not rapidly heated or moved.** Unless the water is under extreme pressure or impurities prevent it (like in very pure, supercooled water), it will begin to crystallize (freeze) as soon as the temperature drops below 0°C.
- Bob's answer, "It freezes," is correct **for any temperature below 0°C**, including -10°C. Alice's correction only applies if the temperature is exactly 0°C.

**In summary:**  
- **At -10°C, water freezes.** Bob is correct in this context because he's answering what happens at a temperature below the freezing point, not at the freezing point itself.
- Alice's statement about "water freezing at 0°C" is also true, but it doesn't contradict Bob's answer in this exchange.

So, **Bob's answer is correct for the question asked.** [end of text]
