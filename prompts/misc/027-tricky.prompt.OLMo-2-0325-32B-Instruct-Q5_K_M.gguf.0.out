A) Yes, water freezes at -12 degrees celsius under normal atmospheric pressure, but this is not the typical freezing point of water. Pure water typically freezes at 0 degrees celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). However, water can be supercooled below its freezing point without turning into ice, a phenomenon known as supercooling. For water to freeze at -12 degrees celsius, it would need to be disturbed or have a nucleation site (like a dust particle) to start the crystallization process. In the absence of such impurities or disturbances, water can remain in a liquid state below its normal freezing point, but at -12 degrees celsius, it will eventually freeze, especially if it encounters a nucleation site.

B) If you have a glass of pure water and cool it down to -12 degrees celsius, it will likely remain in a liquid state until it is disturbed or comes into contact with a nucleation site. This is due to supercooling. However, once disturbed or if a nucleation site is introduced, the water will rapidly freeze. The freezing process can be almost instantaneous and will result in the formation of ice crystals. The water molecules will align themselves into a crystalline structure, and the glass of water will become solid ice. The rate and manner of freezing can vary depending on the purity of the water and the presence of any impurities or surfaces that can act as nucleation sites. [end of text]
