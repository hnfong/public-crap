Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to perform a semantic grep where I output lines with comments, based on the given input and query. The query is "all lines with comments". So first, I need to go through each line of the input and check if it contains a comment.

Looking at the input, each line is numbered. The comments in the script are lines that start with a #. But I need to make sure that the line is obviously a comment, not just a line that has a # in it but isn't a comment. For example, if a line has a # in the middle of a command, maybe it's not a comment. But in the given script, the lines with # are clearly comments, like line 5, 15, 20, 28, 37, 47, 49, 57, etc. Wait, line 47 is empty except for the #, so that's a comment. Line 5 is a comment about saving the path. Line 15 is a comment explaining the script's purpose. Line 20 is a comment about downloading and building pkg-config. Similarly, line 28 is a comment about downloading and building ncurses, line 37 about libevent, line 49 about utf8proc, line 57 about tmux.

But I need to check if the line has something that matches the query. The query is "all lines with comments". So any line that has a comment, which in this case is lines starting with #. However, the user said to only trigger when the input obviously matches the query. So maybe lines that are purely comments, not part of a command. For example, line 47 is just a # followed by a space, which is a comment. But line 15 is a comment that's part of the script's explanation. So all lines that start with # are comments. But wait, line 1 is #!/bin/bash, which is a shebang line, not a comment in the sense of a line that's a comment in the script. But the user's query is "all lines with comments", so maybe the shebang line is considered a comment? Or maybe not. The user might consider lines that have comments as lines that are not just shebangs. But the problem says to output lines that have something that matches the query. So if the line has a comment, regardless of what it is, even if it's a shebang, but the shebang is not a comment in the script's context. Wait, the shebang line is a comment in the sense that it's a comment in the script's code? No, the shebang line is not a comment in the script. It's a directive for the interpreter. So maybe the user wants lines that have comments, i.e., lines that start with # and are not shebang lines. But the user didn't specify that. The query is "all lines with comments", so maybe any line that has a comment, even if it's part of a command. But the user says "only trigger when the input obviously matches the query, i.e., not tangentially related". So perhaps lines that are clearly comments, like those that start with # and are not part of a command. For example, line 1 is a shebang, which is not a comment in the script. But line 5 is a comment about saving the path. So I need to check each line.

Let me go through each line:

Line 1: #!/bin/bash - shebang, not a comment in the script's code. So maybe not included.

Line 2: set -ex - no #, so no.

Line 3: empty line, no #.

Line 4: # Save the path... - starts with #, so comment.

Line 5: script_path=$(python3... - starts with #, so comment.

Line 6: download_check_path... - no #.

Line 7: empty line.

Line 8: function download_and_check() { - no #.

Line 9: set -e - no #.

Line 10: curl -C - -O -L "$1" - no #.

Line 11: local my_filename=$(basename "$1") - no #.

Line 12: "$download_check_path" "$my_filename" - no #.

Line 13: } - no #.

Line 14: empty line.

Line 15: # This is a script... - starts with #, comment.

Line 16: prefix=$HOME/apps/tmux - no #.

Line 17: mkdir -p "$prefix" - no #.

Line 18: cd "$prefix" - no #.

Line 19: empty line.

Line 20: # Download and build pkg-config... - starts with #, comment.

Line 21: tar zxvf pkg-config-0.29.2.tar.gz - no #.

Line 22: cd pkg-config-0.29.2 - no #.

Line 23: CFLAGS="-Wno-int-conversion" ./configure... - no #.

Line 24: make -j 10 - no #.

Line 25: make install - no #.

Line 26: cd .. - no #.

Line 27: empty line.

Line 28: # Download and build ncurses... - starts with #, comment.

Line 29: tar zxvf ncurses-6.5.tar.gz - no #.

Line 30: cd ncurses-6.5 - no #.

Line 31: ./configure --prefix="$prefix" - no #.

Line 32: make -j 10 - no #.

Line 33: make install - no #.

Line 34: cd .. - no #.

Line 35: empty line.

Line 36: # Download and build libevent... - starts with #, comment.

Line 37: tar zxvf libevent-2.1.12-stable.tar.gz - no #.

Line 38: cd libevent-2.1.12-stable - no #.

Line 39: ./configure --disable-openssl --prefix="$prefix" - no #.

Line 40: make -j 10 - no #.

Line 41: make install - no #.

Line 42: cd .. - no #.

Line 43: empty line.

Line 44: # Download and build utf8proc... - starts with #, comment.

Line 45: tar zxvf utf8proc-2.9.0.tar.gz - no #.

Line 46: cd utf8proc-2.9.0 - no #.

Line 47: empty line (but line 47 is just a #, so maybe line 47 is a comment. Wait, line 47 is "# Download and build utf8proc" but in the input, line 47 is empty? Wait, looking back at the input:

Wait the input lines:

Looking at the input provided:

Line 47: # Download and build utf8proc

Wait no, line 47 is:

47:
48:# Download and build utf8proc

Wait, line 47 is empty, then line 48 starts with #. So line 47 is empty, line 48 is a comment. So line 48 is a comment.

Then line 49: download_and_check 'https://github.com/JuliaStrings/utf8proc/releases/download/v2.9.0/utf8proc-2.9.0.tar.gz'

No # here. Line 50: tar zxvf utf8proc-2.9.0.tar.gz - no #.

Line 51: cd utf8proc-2.9.0 - no #.

Line 52: make prefix="$prefix" - no #.

Line 53: make install prefix="$prefix" - no #.

Line 54: cd .. - no #.

Line 55: empty line.

Line 56: # Download and build tmux... - starts with #, comment.

Line 57: download_and_check 'https://github.com/tmux/tmux/releases/download/3.5a/tmux-3.5a.tar.gz' - no #.

Line 58: tar zxvf tmux-3.5a.tar.gz - no #.

Line 59: cd tmux-3.5a - no #.

Line 60: PKG_CONFIG="$prefix"/bin/pkg-config ./configure... - no #.

Line 61: make -j 10 - no #.

Line 62: make install - no #.

Line 63: cd .. - no #.

Line 64: ln -sf "$prefix"/bin/tmux ~/bin/tmux - no #.

So the lines that start with # are lines 4, 5, 15, 20, 28, 36, 48, 56. Wait, line 48 is "# Download and build utf8proc" but in the input, line 47 is empty, then line 48 is the comment. So line 48 is a comment. Also line 56 is a comment.

Wait, the input lines:

Looking at the input again:

Line 47: (empty line)

Line 48: # Download and build utf8proc

Line 49: download_and_check 'https://github.com/JuliaStrings/utf8proc/releases/download/v2.9.0/utf8proc-2.9.0.tar.gz'

So line 48 is a comment. Then line 56 is a comment.

So the lines with comments are lines 4, 5, 15, 20, 28, 36, 48, 56.

Wait line 15 is "# This is a script to build..." which is a comment.

So those lines are the ones that start with # and are not part of a command. So the output should be those lines with their numbers.

But wait, line 5 is a comment that's part of the script. So all lines that start with # are comments. So the answer is lines 4,5,15,20,28,36,48,56.

Wait line 36 is "# Download and build libevent" (line 36 is the line with the comment). Wait in the input, line 36 is:

36: # Download and build libevent

Wait no, looking back:

Line 36: # Download and build libevent

Wait line 36 is line 36? Let me check the input again.

Wait, line 44 is empty, line 45 is "# Download and build utf8proc" (line 45?), no. Wait the input as given:

Looking at the input again:

After line 43: cd ..
44:

So line 44 is empty, line 45 is a comment. Then line 46 is tar zxvf..., line 47 is cd..., line 48 is make..., line 49 is make install..., line 50 is cd .., line 51 is empty.

Then line 52 is "# Download and build tmux" (line 52).

So the lines with comments are:

Line 4: # Save the path...

Line 5: script_path=... (no, line 5 starts with script_path, not a comment. Wait line 5 is not a comment. Wait line 4 is a comment, line 5 is not. Wait line 5 is:

5:script_path=$(python3 -c 'import os,sys; print(os.path.realpath(sys.argv[1]))' "$0")

So that's not a comment. Wait, the user's input line 5 is not a comment. Wait the user's input line 4 is a comment, line 5 is not. Wait the user's input line 5 is:

Line 5: script_path=$(python3 -c 'import os,sys; print(os.path.realpath(sys.argv[1]))' "$0")

So that's not a comment. So the lines that start with # are lines 4, 15, 20, 28, 36, 45, 52.

Wait line 45 is "# Download and build utf8proc" (line 45), line 52 is "# Download and build tmux" (line 52). Also line 4 is "# Save the path...", line 15 is "# This is a script...", line 20 is "# Download and build pkg-config", line 28 is "# Download and build ncurses", line 36 is "# Download and build libevent".

So those lines are the ones that start with # and are not part of a command. So the answer should include lines 4, 15, 20, 28, 36, 45, 52.

Wait line 45 is "# Download and build utf8proc" (line 45), line 52 is "# Download and build tmux" (line 52). Also line 4 is "# Save the path...", line 15 is "# This is a script...", line 20 is "# Download and build pkg-config", line 28 is "# Download and build ncurses", line 36 is "# Download and build libevent".

So those are the lines that have comments. So the output should be those lines with their numbers.

So the lines are:

4: # Save the path to ./download_check script

15: # This is a script to build and install tmux on macOS without homebrew.

20: # Download and build pkg-config

28: # Download and build ncurses

36: # Download and build libevent

45: # Download and build utf8proc

52: # Download and build tmux

Wait line 45 is line 45, which is the line with the comment. Then line 52 is the line with the comment.

So those are the lines that have comments. So the output should be these lines with their line numbers, each followed by "---".
