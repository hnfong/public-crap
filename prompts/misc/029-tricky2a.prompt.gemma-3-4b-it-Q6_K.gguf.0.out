Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Alice is right. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit). -10 degrees Celsius is well below freezing point. 

Bob is incorrect in his assertion that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius. 

It's a good example of how seemingly simple facts can be easily confused! [end of text]
