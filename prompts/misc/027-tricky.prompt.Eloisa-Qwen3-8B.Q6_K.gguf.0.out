Okay, let's tackle these two questions one by one. 

Starting with question A: "Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?" Well, I know that the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius under standard conditions. But wait, the question is straightforward, so maybe it's a trick. No, actually, water does freeze at -12°C. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, water freezes at 0°C, so at -12°C, which is below freezing, it should be ice. But the question is phrased as "does water freeze at -12°C?" So, if you have water at -12°C, it's already frozen, right? Wait, no. Wait, the freezing point is 0°C, so if you cool water below 0°C, it will freeze. So at -12°C, water is already frozen. But the question is asking if water freezes at that temperature. Hmm, maybe the user is confused about the process. Let me think again. The freezing point is 0°C, so water turns into ice at 0°C. If you cool it to -12°C, it's already ice. So the answer is yes, but the process of freezing occurs at 0°C, not at -12°C. Wait, no. Wait, the question is "does water freeze at -12°C?" So, if you have water at -12°C, it's already frozen, so technically, it has frozen at some point when it was cooled to 0°C. But the temperature at which it freezes is 0°C. So maybe the answer is no, because freezing happens at 0°C, not at -12°C. Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify. The freezing point is 0°C, so water freezes when it reaches 0°C. At -12°C, it's already frozen, so the freezing process occurred at 0°C. Therefore, the answer to A is no, water does not freeze at -12°C; it freezes at 0°C. But the user might be asking if water can exist as ice at -12°C, which it can. So I need to be careful with the wording. The question is "does water freeze at -12°C?" So, the act of freezing happens at 0°C, not at -12°C. So the answer is no. But maybe the user is thinking about whether water can freeze at that temperature, which it can, but the process is at 0°C. Hmm, I think the correct answer is that water freezes at 0°C, so at -12°C, it's already frozen. So the answer to A is no, it doesn't freeze at -12°C; it freezes at 0°C. 

Now, question B: "I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?" So, if you cool pure water to -12°C, it will freeze into ice. But wait, pure water freezes at 0°C, so cooling it below 0°C should cause it to freeze. However, there's something called supercooling where water can be cooled below 0°C without freezing, but that's not typical. So under normal conditions, it should freeze. But the question says "pure water," so maybe it's assuming standard conditions. So the answer is that it will freeze into ice. But wait, the temperature is -12°C, which is well below freezing, so yes, it should freeze. But I should mention that under normal circumstances, water freezes at 0°C, so cooling it to -12°C would definitely cause it to freeze. 

Wait, but in question A, I concluded that water doesn't freeze at -12°C, but in B, it does freeze when cooled to that temperature. That seems contradictory. Let me reconcile that. The freezing point is 0°C, so water freezes when it reaches 0°C. If you cool it to -12°C, it's already frozen, so the freezing occurred at 0°C. Therefore, the answer to A is no, it doesn't freeze at -12°C. For B, when you cool the water to -12°C, it will freeze at 0°C, and then remain as ice at -12°C. So the process of freezing happens at 0°C, not at -12°C. So for B, the water will freeze when cooled to 0°C, and then stay as ice at -12°C. 

So, to summarize: 

A) No, water freezes at 0°C, not at -12°C. 

B) The water will freeze when cooled to 0°C, and then remain as ice at -12°C. 

But the user might be confused between the temperature at which freezing occurs and the temperature at which the substance exists. So I need to make sure the answers are clear. 

For A, the answer is no, because freezing occurs at 0°C. 

For B, when cooled to -12°C, the water will have already frozen (assuming it was cooled gradually), so it will be ice. 

But if the water is supercooled, it might not freeze until it reaches a lower temperature or nucleation occurs. However, the question specifies "pure water," and under normal conditions, pure water can supercool, but it's not typical. So maybe the answer should assume standard freezing. 

I think the best approach is to answer based on standard freezing point. So for A, no. For B, it will freeze into ice. 

But in B, the temperature is -12°C, which is below freezing, so the water will be ice. 

So the answers are: 

A) No, water freezes at 0°C. 

B) The water will freeze into ice. 

But I need to be precise. Let me check again. 

Question A: "Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?" 

Freezing is the process of turning from liquid to solid. This occurs at the freezing point, which is 0°C for pure water. Therefore, water does not freeze at -12°C; it freezes at 0°C. 

Question B: "I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?" 

If you cool pure water to -12°C, it will have frozen into ice, assuming it was cooled gradually and no supercooling occurred. 

So the answers are: 

A) No 

B) It freezes into ice 

But I should explain briefly. 

For A, the freezing point is 0°C, so no. 

For B, cooling to -12°C will cause it to freeze. 

Yes, that makes sense.
</think>

A) No, water freezes at 0°C under standard conditions. At -12°C, it is already frozen (ice) if it was cooled below 0°C.

B) The water will freeze into ice when cooled to -12°C, as this temperature is below the freezing point of water. [end of text]
