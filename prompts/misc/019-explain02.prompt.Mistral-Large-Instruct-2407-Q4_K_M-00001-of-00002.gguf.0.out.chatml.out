Alright, imagine you're in your school and you have a big group of friends who help decide what games to play and what rules to follow. In China, there's a big group of adults called the National People's Congress. They meet every year to decide on rules and laws for the country, just like you and your friends do at school! They talk about how to make China a better place to live, just like you talk about how to make your school a better place to play. And even though you live in London, it's good to know about other countries and how they make decisions too!
