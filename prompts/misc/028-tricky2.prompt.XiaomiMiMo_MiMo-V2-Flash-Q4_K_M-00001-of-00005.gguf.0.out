<think>First, the question is about what happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius. Alice says water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, which is correct based on standard knowledge. Bob says water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius, but then he says he's still right even after Alice corrects him.

I need to figure out who is right. Alice is correct that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under normal conditions. But Bob might be referring to something else? Maybe he's thinking about supercooled water or something? But at -10 degrees Celsius, water should be frozen unless it's supercooled, but supercooled water is not stable and would freeze quickly.

Bob says "I'm still right" after Alice corrects him. This might be a trick question or a play on words. Perhaps Bob is referring to the fact that at -10 degrees Celsius, water is frozen, so it has already frozen at 0 degrees and is now frozen at -10 degrees. So, in a sense, water is frozen at -10 degrees Celsius, but it freezes at 0 degrees.

Alice says "water freezes at 0 degrees celsius" which is true, meaning the freezing point is 0 degrees. Bob says "water freezes at -10 degrees celsius" which is false because the freezing point is 0 degrees. But then Bob says "I'm still right" which might be because at -10 degrees, water is frozen, so it has frozen and is frozen at that temperature.

So, who is right? Alice is right about the freezing point, but Bob might be right about the state of water at -10 degrees.

Let me read the dialogue again:

Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"

Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."

Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."

Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

So, Bob initially claims that water freezes at -10 degrees, which is incorrect. Alice corrects him. Bob then acknowledges that water freezes at 0 degrees but insists he is still right.

Why might Bob be right? Perhaps because at -10 degrees, water is frozen, so it has frozen (at 0 degrees) and is now frozen at -10 degrees. So, in a way, water is frozen at -10 degrees, but it doesn't freeze at -10 degrees; it freezes at 0 degrees.

The phrase "water freezes at -10 degrees" means that the freezing point is -10 degrees, which is false. But if Bob means that at -10 degrees, water is frozen, then that is true.

But Bob's statement is "water freezes at -10 degrees celsius" which is a statement about the freezing point, not the state. So, Alice is correct that the freezing point is 0 degrees.

However, Bob says "I'm still right" after Alice corrects him, so he might be meaning that at -10 degrees, water is frozen, so his initial statement might be interpreted as "water is frozen at -10 degrees" but he said "freezes at" which implies the action of freezing at that temperature.

In common language, "water freezes at 0 degrees" means that is the temperature where freezing occurs. "Water freezes at -10 degrees" would mean that freezing occurs at -10 degrees, which is not true.

But Bob might be using "freezes" to mean "is frozen" in a loose sense.

This seems like a wordplay. I recall that in some contexts, people might say "water freezes at -10 degrees" meaning that at -10 degrees, water is frozen, but that's not standard.

Another thought: perhaps Bob is referring to the fact that water can supercool and remain liquid at -10 degrees, but that would mean it does not freeze at -10 degrees, so Bob would be wrong if he says it freezes at -10 degrees. But supercooled water is unstable and would freeze if disturbed, so at -10 degrees, water can be frozen or supercooled, but typically, it is frozen.

But Alice says water freezes at 0 degrees, which is true for the freezing point.

Let me consider the scientific facts. The freezing point of water at standard pressure is 0 degrees Celsius. At -10 degrees Celsius, water is solid ice, so it is frozen. But it freezes at 0 degrees, not at -10 degrees.

So, for the question "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" the answer is that it is frozen. Bob says "water freezes at -10 degrees celsius" which is incorrect because freezing occurs at 0 degrees. But if Bob means that at -10 degrees, water is frozen, then he is right about the state, but wrong about the freezing point.

Alice corrects him about the freezing point, and Bob says "I'm still right" which might mean that he is right about the state at -10 degrees.

So, who is right? Alice is right about the freezing point, but Bob is right about the state at -10 degrees. However, the question is "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" so the correct answer is that it is frozen. Bob initially said "water freezes at -10 degrees celsius" which is misleading, but he might be implying that it is frozen at that temperature.

In the context, Bob says "Yes, but I'm still right" after Alice says water freezes at 0 degrees. So, Bob agrees that water freezes at 0 degrees, but he still thinks he is right about what happens at -10 degrees.

So, for the question "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" the answer is that it is frozen. Bob's statement "water freezes at -10 degrees" is not accurate, but if we interpret it as "water is frozen at -10 degrees", then he is correct.

But Alice is correct about the freezing point.

So, both are right in a way, but Bob's initial statement is technically wrong.

Perhaps the point is that Bob is right that at -10 degrees, water is frozen, so his statement "water freezes at -10 degrees" might be a common way to say that at that temperature, water is frozen, even though it freezes at 0 degrees.

In everyday language, people might say "water freezes at -10 degrees" meaning that at -10 degrees, it is frozen, but that's not precise.

But in this dialogue, Alice corrects him, and Bob admits that water freezes at 0 degrees but still claims he is right.

So, I think Bob is right about the state of water at -10 degrees, but wrong about the freezing point.

Therefore, for the question "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" the correct answer is that it is frozen, so Bob is right in that sense, but he is wrong about the freezing temperature.

Alice is right about the freezing temperature.

But the question is who is right in the context of the dialogue.

Alice says "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius" which is correct, and Bob says "Yes, but I'm still right" which means he agrees that water freezes at 0 degrees, but he still thinks he is right about what happens at -10 degrees.

So, Bob is right that at -10 degrees, water is frozen.

Thus, both are right, but about different aspects.

But let's see the initial question: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" Bob's answer is "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius." which is incorrect as a statement about the freezing point, but if we take it as a statement about the state, it is correct.

In the dialogue, Alice corrects him about the freezing point, and Bob agrees but says he is still right, so he might mean that his statement about the state is correct.

So, I think Bob is right about the state, and Alice is right about the freezing point.

But for the purpose of this question, who is right? Since Bob says he is still right, and he is right that at -10 degrees, water is frozen, so he is right about what happens at -10 degrees.

Alice is right about when freezing occurs.

So, for the question "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" Bob's answer, though poorly worded, implies that it is frozen, which is correct.

Alice's correction is about the freezing point, which is not directly what happens at -10 degrees, but what happens at 0 degrees.

So, in response to the question, Bob is correct that water is frozen at -10 degrees, while Alice is correct about the freezing temperature.

Therefore, both are right, but Bob is right about the state at -10 degrees, and Alice is right about the freezing point.

But the question is "Who is right?" in the dialogue.

Bob insists he is still right after Alice corrects him, so he is right about the state at -10 degrees.

So, I think Bob is right about what happens at -10 degrees, and Alice is right about when freezing happens.

But since the question is about what happens at -10 degrees, Bob is right.

Let me consider supercooled water. If water is supercooled, it might not freeze at -10 degrees, but that is not typical. In most cases, water at -10 degrees is frozen. So, for practical purposes, water is frozen at -10 degrees.

So, Bob is right that at -10 degrees, water is frozen.

Alice is right that water freezes at 0 degrees.

So, for the specific question, Bob's answer is correct in meaning, though not in precise language.

Therefore, Bob is right about what happens at -10 degrees.

So, who is right? Bob is right about the state at -10 degrees, and Alice is right about the freezing point, but since the question is about what happens at -10 degrees, Bob is correct.

In the dialogue, Alice says "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius" which is true, but she doesn't directly say what happens at -10 degrees. Bob says "water freezes at -10 degrees" which is false, but he means that it is frozen at -10 degrees.

So, I think Bob is right in spirit, but technically, Alice is correct about the freezing point.

But since Bob says "I'm still right" and he is right about the state at -10 degrees, he is still right.

So, for the purpose of this question, I would say Bob is right about what happens at -10 degrees.

But let's see the answer.

Perhaps there is a trick with the temperature. -10 degrees Celsius is below freezing, so water is frozen. So, Bob is right that water is frozen at -10 degrees, but he is wrong that it freezes at -10 degrees.

Alice is right that it freezes at 0 degrees.

So, both are right about different things.

But in the context, Bob is right about the outcome at -10 degrees.

So, I think Bob is right.

Another thought: in some languages or contexts, "water freezes at -10 degrees" might be said to mean that at -10 degrees, it is frozen, but that's not standard English.

In standard English, "water freezes at X degrees" means that X is the temperature where freezing occurs.

So, Alice is correct.

But Bob insists he is still right, so he might be referring to the fact that at -10 degrees, water is frozen, so his statement "water freezes at -10 degrees" can be interpreted as "water is frozen at -10 degrees" which is true.

So, for the question "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" the answer is that it is frozen, so Bob is right.

Alice is right about when freezing happens, but that is not what happens at -10 degrees.

So, for the specific question, Bob is correct.

Therefore, Bob is right.

So, I'll go with Bob being right about what happens at -10 degrees.

But let's explain briefly.</think>Bob is right about the state of water at -10 degrees Celsius: water is frozen at that temperature. Alice is correct that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, but Bob's statement "water freezes at -10 degrees" can be interpreted as meaning that at -10 degrees, water is frozen, which is true. Thus, for the question "What happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius?" Bob's answer is correct in spirit, even though the freezing point is 0 degrees. [end of text]
