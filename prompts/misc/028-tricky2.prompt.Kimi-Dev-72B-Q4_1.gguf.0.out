Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. Bob's statement that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius is incorrect. The freezing point of water is a well-established physical property, and it does not change unless the pressure is altered. Therefore, Alice's assertion is accurate, and Bob's response is not correct.
