### Conflicting Events

Here is an analysis of the events that have conflicting schedules and the reasons why.

#### Conflict 1: November 15, 2023

*   **Events in Conflict:**
    1.  `Annual Tech Symposium`
    2.  `Marketing Strategy Retreat`
    3.  `New Hire Orientation`

*   **Why they conflict:** All three events are scheduled for the same day, November 15, 2023, and their timeframes overlap significantly.
    *   `New Hire Orientation` runs from 09:00 to 12:00.
    *   `Annual Tech Symposium` runs from 09:00 to 17:00, completely encompassing the `New Hire Orientation`.
    *   `Marketing Strategy Retreat` runs from 10:30 to 15:30. This overlaps with the end of the `New Hire Orientation` and the middle of the `Annual Tech Symposium`.
    *   A person cannot reasonably attend all three, or even two of these, as they are happening concurrently.

#### Conflict 2: March 1, 2022

*   **Events in Conflict:**
    1.  `Project Phoenix Kick-off`
    2.  `Q3 Budget Review`
    3.  `Public Speaking Seminar`

*   **Why they conflict:** These three events are all on March 1, 2022, with overlapping times.
    *   `Public Speaking Seminar` runs from 13:00 to 14:30.
    *   `Project Phoenix Kick-off` runs from 14:00 to 16:00. This directly conflicts with the end of the `Public Speaking Seminar`.
    *   `Q3 Budget Review` runs from 15:00 to 17:00. This overlaps with the end of the `Project Phoenix Kick-off`.
    *   This creates a "domino effect" conflict where one event ends just as another begins, making it impossible to attend all of them.

#### Conflict 3: September 5, 2023

*   **Events in Conflict:**
    1.  `Product Launch Event`
    2.  `All-Hands Meeting`
    3.  `UI/UX Design Sprint`

*   **Why they conflict:** These events are tightly packed on the same day, September 5, 2023.
    *   `UI/UX Design Sprint` runs from 10:00 to 12:00.
    *   `Product Launch Event` runs from 13:00 to 14:30.
    *   `All-Hands Meeting` runs from 14:00 to 15:00.
    *   The primary conflict is between the `Product Launch Event` and the `All-Hands Meeting`. The `All-Hands Meeting` begins one hour before the `Product Launch Event` ends, creating a direct 30-minute overlap. This would force someone to choose which event to attend or leave one early.

#### Conflict 4: September 12, 2022

*   **Events in Conflict:**
    1.  `Client Presentation: Acme Corp`
    2.  `Charity 5K Run`
    3.  `Customer Support Training`

*   **Why they conflict:** All three events occur on the morning of September 12, 2022.
    *   `Charity 5K Run` runs from 08:00 to 10:00.
    *   `Customer Support Training` runs from 10:00 to 11:30.
    *   `Client Presentation: Acme Corp` runs from 11:00 to 12:00.
    *   The `Customer Support Training` and the `Client Presentation` have a direct 30-minute overlap (from 11:00 to 11:30). While the `Charity 5K Run` ends just as the training begins, it would be physically challenging to attend both back-to-back.

#### Conflict 5: February 28, 2024

*   **Events in Conflict:**
    1.  `Regional Sales Conference`
    2.  `Board of Directors Meeting`

*   **Why they conflict:** These two events overlap on the first day of the multi-day `Regional Sales Conference`.
    *   `Regional Sales Conference` runs from 08:00 on Feb 28 to 17:00 on Feb 29.
    *   `Board of Directors Meeting` runs from 09:00 to 11:00 on Feb 28.
    *   The `Board of Directors Meeting` is entirely contained within the first day of the `Regional Sales Conference`, making it impossible for someone required to be at both to fulfill their obligations.

#### Conflict 6: August 13, 2024

*   **Events in Conflict:**
    1.  `Summer Music Festival`
    2.  `Server Maintenance`
    3.  `Final Code Freeze`
    4.  `Annual Shareholder Report`

*   **Why they conflict:** This is a major conflict involving four events on the same day, August 13, 2024.
    *   `Final Code Freeze` is an all-day event (00:01 to 23:59).
    *   `Summer Music Festival` is a multi-day event that is active on this day.
    *   `Server Maintenance` is scheduled from 02:00 to 06:00.
    *   `Annual Shareholder Report` is scheduled from 10:00 to 11:00.
    *   The `Final Code Freeze` technically conflicts with everything else on the day, as it represents a full-day operational period. The `Server Maintenance` and `Annual Shareholder Report
