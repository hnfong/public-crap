Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10 degrees Celsius, water is already in a frozen state, assuming it has had the opportunity to freeze. Bob's statement that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius is incorrect because it implies that -10 degrees Celsius is the freezing point, which it is not.

To clarify:
- Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius.
- At -10 degrees Celsius, water is below the freezing point and is typically ice, provided it has had time to freeze.

Therefore, Alice's correction is accurate. [end of text]
