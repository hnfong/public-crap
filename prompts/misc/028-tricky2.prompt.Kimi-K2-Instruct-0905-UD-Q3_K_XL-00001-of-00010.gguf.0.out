Bob is right.  
At normal atmospheric pressure pure liquid water cannot stay liquid at –10 °C; it freezes. So “water freezes at –10 °C” is true, even though the temperature at which the freezing begins is 0 °C. Saying it freezes at –10 °C just means that, if you cool it that far, it will certainly have frozen (or will freeze while passing through that temperature). Alice’s statement is also true, but it doesn’t contradict Bob’s.
