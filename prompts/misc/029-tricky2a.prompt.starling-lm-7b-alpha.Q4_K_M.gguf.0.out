Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is right because water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, but it can still be considered "cold" at -10 degrees Celsius. Alice is technically correct, but Bob's statement is more accurate in terms of the freezing point of water.

In terms of temperature, -10 degrees Celsius is colder than 0 degrees Celsius, but in terms of the freezing point of water, 0 degrees Celsius is the correct temperature. 

Both Alice and Bob have valid points, but Bob's statement is more accurate in terms of the freezing point of water. 

In summary, while Alice is technically correct, Bob's statement is more accurate in terms of the freezing point of water.
