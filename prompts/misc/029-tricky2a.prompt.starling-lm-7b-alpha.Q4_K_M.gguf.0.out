Bob is right because water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, but it can still be considered "cold" at -10 degrees Celsius. Alice is technically correct, but Bob's statement is more accurate in terms of the freezing point of water.

In terms of temperature, -10 degrees Celsius is indeed colder than 0 degrees Celsius. However, when it comes to the freezing point of water, 0 degrees Celsius is the temperature at which water transitions from a liquid to a solid state. 

At -10 degrees Celsius, water is still in its liquid state, although it is a very cold liquid. It is not until the temperature reaches 0 degrees Celsius that water begins to freeze and turn into ice. 

Therefore, while Alice's statement is technically correct, Bob's statement is more accurate in terms of understanding the freezing point of water. 

In summary, while Alice is correct in stating that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, Bob's statement that water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius is also correct, albeit less accurate in terms of the freezing point of water.
