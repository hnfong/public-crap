If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

When a theory proves its own consistency, it is typically referred to as "self-verifying" or "self-proving," rather than "consistent" or "tautological." Here are some key terms and examples to clarify these concepts:

1. **Consistent**: A theory is consistent if it does not contain any contradictions. In other words, there is no statement in the theory such that both the statement and its negation can be proven.

2. **Tautological**: A statement is tautological if it is true by necessity or by virtue of its logical form. For example, "It is raining or it is not raining" is a tautology.

3. **Self-verifying or Self-proving**: A theory that can prove its own consistency within its own framework.

### Examples:

1. **Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems**: One of the most famous results in mathematical logic is Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem, which states that any sufficiently strong formal system capable of expressing elementary arithmetic cannot prove its own consistency. This theorem implies that many interesting mathematical theories cannot be self-verifying.

2. **Peano Arithmetic (PA)**: Peano Arithmetic is a first-order theory that formalizes the natural numbers and their properties. According to Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem, PA cannot prove its own consistency.

3. **Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory (ZFC)**: ZFC is a standard form of axiomatic set theory and is used as a foundation for mathematics. Like PA, ZFC cannot prove its own consistency due to Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem.

### Non-examples:

1. **Presburger Arithmetic**: This is a weaker system of arithmetic that deals with the natural numbers and addition but not multiplication. Unlike PA, Presburger Arithmetic is decidable and can be shown to be consistent, but it does not prove its own consistency within its own framework.

2. **Tarski's Geometry**: Alfred Tarski developed a system of geometry that is complete and decidable. While it is consistent, it does not prove its own consistency within its own framework.

In summary, theories that prove their own consistency are rare and often limited in scope due to the constraints imposed by Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems. The terms "consistent" and "tautological" have specific meanings in logic and do not directly apply to the concept of a theory proving its own consistency.
