If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

 In formal logic, the term "consistent" is used to describe a logical system that maintains a certain level of truth-value coherence, meaning that the system does not allow any false statements to be true. In other words, a consistent system guarantees that each statement in its language is either true or false.

In classical logic, there are two theories that are consistently true: the Peano-Aumann axioms and the Taitian axioms. However, these are not considered "consistent" theories because they are not consistent with themselves.

A common example of a tautological theory is the set theory used in mathematics. While set theory is consistent and well-behaved, it can be considered tautological because it contains all the objects of the natural numbers, with no additional objects added to accommodate additional properties or operations.<|im_end|>
