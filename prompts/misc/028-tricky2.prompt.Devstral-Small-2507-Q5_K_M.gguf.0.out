Bob is correct. While it's true that water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, it can also freeze at lower temperatures, such as -10 degrees Celsius, depending on the conditions. For example, if water is pure and free of impurities, it can remain liquid below 0 degrees Celsius in a process called supercooling. However, once it starts to freeze, it will do so at -10 degrees Celsius or any other temperature below 0 degrees Celsius. So, Bob's statement that water can freeze at -10 degrees Celsius is accurate.
