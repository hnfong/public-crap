Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Give me your interpretation. You do not have to translate the contents, but you may if you wish.

The lyrics of the song describe a fantastical setting involving a small forest restaurant. Here's an interpretation:

The song seems to be about a whimsical journey to a small, unassuming forest restaurant. The protagonist searches for the restaurant, but it seems to be elusive, like a dream or a myth. The restaurant is always empty, with no reservations, and the tables are always free. The atmosphere is cheerful, with birds laughing and a lively menu played by various instruments.

The restaurant itself is a fantastical place, with a red-painted tin roof and a menu that only includes recommended dishes. The kitchen is bustling with music, creating a magical atmosphere. The protagonist is welcomed with open arms, offered a hearty meal, and then sent off with a promise of a new adventure tomorrow.

The song also hints at a deeper, more fantastical story. The protagonist is searching for something or someone, perhaps a lost loved one, and the restaurant is a place of solace and hope. The meal is a metaphor for the journey itself, and the promise of tomorrow is a symbol of hope and renewal.

In summary, the song tells a story of a fantastical journey to a small forest restaurant, where the protagonist finds solace, hope, and a sense of belonging. The setting is whimsical and magical, with a touch of melancholy and longing.
