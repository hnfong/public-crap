Okay, let's see. So the question is about who is right between Alice and Bob regarding the freezing point of water. Alice says water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, and Bob says it freezes at -10 degrees Celsius. Then Alice corrects him, saying it's actually 0 degrees, but Bob insists he's still right.

Hmm, first I need to recall the standard freezing point of water. From what I remember, pure water freezes at 0°C under standard atmospheric pressure. So Alice is correct about that. But Bob says -10°C. Wait, why would he say that? Maybe he's confused about something else.

Wait, the question is asking who is right. So Alice says 0°C, Bob says -10°C. But then Bob says, "Yes, but I'm still right." So he's claiming that even though Alice says it's 0°C, he's correct. How can that be?

Wait, maybe Bob is talking about a different context. Like, maybe he's referring to supercooled water or something. Supercooled water can stay liquid below 0°C, but that's not the normal freezing point. The normal freezing point is 0°C. So if Bob says water freezes at -10°C, that's not the standard answer. But he says he's still right. Maybe he's making a joke or a play on words?

Wait, let's read the dialogue again. Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius." Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius." Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Wait, so Alice is asking what happens to water at -10°C. Bob answers that it freezes at -10°C. But Alice corrects him, saying it freezes at 0°C. Then Bob says, "Yes, but I'm still right." So Bob is agreeing that the freezing point is 0°C, but he's still right about his original statement. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If he said water freezes at -10°C, but the actual freezing point is 0°C, then his statement is wrong. But he's saying he's still right. So maybe there's a trick here.

Wait, maybe Bob is referring to the temperature at which water freezes, but in a different context. Like, if the water is already at -10°C, then it's already frozen. Wait, but the question is "what happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius?" So if the water is at -10°C, it's already frozen. So Bob says "water freezes at -10 degrees," but actually, water freezes when it reaches 0°C, so at -10°C, it's already frozen. So Bob's statement is incorrect because the freezing happens at 0°C, not at -10°C. But Bob says he's still right. How?

Wait, maybe Bob is interpreting the question differently. Alice asked, "What happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius?" So if the water is at -10°C, it's frozen. So Bob says "water freezes at -10 degrees," but actually, the freezing occurs at 0°C, so the water would be frozen at -10°C, but the process of freezing happens at 0°C. So Bob's statement is a bit off. But he's saying he's still right. Wait, maybe he's making a pun or a play on words.

Wait, another angle: maybe Bob is talking about the temperature at which water is frozen, not the freezing point. Like, if water is frozen, it's at -10°C. But that's not correct because frozen water (ice) can be at any temperature below 0°C. So if the temperature is -10°C, the water would be frozen, but the freezing point is 0°C. So Bob's statement "water freezes at -10 degrees" is wrong because freezing occurs at 0°C, but the state of being frozen can be at -10°C. So maybe Bob is conflating the freezing point with the temperature at which it's frozen.

Wait, but the question is "what happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius?" So if the water is at -10°C, it's frozen. So Bob says "water freezes at -10 degrees," which is incorrect because freezing happens at 0°C, but the water would be frozen at -10°C. So Bob's answer is wrong in terms of the freezing point, but if the question is asking what happens at -10°C, then the answer is that the water is frozen. So maybe Bob is answering the question correctly, but his phrasing is off. Wait, the question is "what happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius?" So the answer is "it freezes" or "it's frozen." But Bob says "water freezes at -10 degrees," which is a statement about the freezing point, not the state at that temperature. So if the question is asking for the state at -10°C, the answer is "it's frozen," but Bob is stating the freezing point as -10°C, which is wrong. So Alice is correct that the freezing point is 0°C, but Bob's answer to the question might be misinterpreted.

Wait, but Bob's answer is "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius." So he's stating the freezing point as -10°C, which is incorrect. Alice corrects him, saying it's 0°C. Then Bob says, "Yes, but I'm still right." So he's agreeing that the freezing point is 0°C, but he's still right about his original statement. Wait, how? If he said the freezing point is -10°C, but it's actually 0°C, then his statement is wrong. But he's saying he's still right. So maybe there's a different interpretation.

Wait, maybe Bob is referring to the temperature at which water freezes in a specific context. For example, if the water is under pressure or something. But standard freezing point is 0°C at 1 atm. Unless it's supercooled, but supercooled water can be below 0°C without freezing, but it's not the normal freezing point. So Bob's statement isn't correct in the standard case.

Wait, but Bob says "I'm still right." So maybe he's making a joke. Like, if the question is "what happens to water at -10°C," then the answer is that it's frozen, so Bob's statement "water freezes at -10°C" is a bit misleading, but if you interpret it as "water is frozen at -10°C," then it's correct. But he said "freezes," which is the process, not the state. So "water freezes at 0°C" is correct, meaning the process happens at 0°C. "Water is frozen at -10°C" is correct, meaning the state is frozen at that temperature. So Bob said "freezes" instead of "is frozen," so his statement is wrong, but if he had said "is frozen," it would be right. But he said "freezes," so he's incorrect. But he's claiming he's still right. So maybe he's playing on the wording.

Wait, but the question is "what happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius?" So the answer is "it freezes" or "it becomes frozen." But if the water is already at -10°C, it's already frozen, so the process of freezing would have happened at 0°C. So if the water is at -10°C, it's already frozen, so the answer to "what happens" is that it's frozen. So Bob's answer "water freezes at -10°C" is incorrect because the freezing happens at 0°C, but the water is frozen at -10°C. So Bob's statement is mixing up the process and the state.

But Bob says, "Yes, but I'm still right." So he's agreeing that the freezing point is 0°C, but he's still right about his original statement. Wait, how? If he said "water freezes at -10°C," but the freezing point is 0°C, then his statement is wrong. But maybe he's saying that at -10°C, the water is frozen, so his statement "water freezes at -10°C" is a misstatement, but the outcome is correct. Wait, but "freezes" is the action, so it's the point at which it changes from liquid to solid. So the correct statement is "water freezes at 0°C," meaning that's the temperature where the phase change occurs. So if the temperature is -10°C, the water is already frozen, so the freezing happened at 0°C. So Bob's answer is wrong. But he's claiming he's still right.

Wait, maybe Bob is referring to the temperature at which water is frozen, not the freezing point. So "water freezes at -10°C" would mean that when it's at -10°C, it's frozen. But the correct phrasing would be "water is frozen at -10°C." So Bob used "freezes" instead of "is frozen," which is a grammatical error. So if he had said "is frozen," he'd be correct, but since he said "freezes," it's wrong. But he's saying he's still right. So maybe he's making a pun on the word "freezes." Wait, but "freezes" is the verb for the process. So "water freezes at 0°C" is correct. "Water freezes at -10°C" is incorrect.

Wait, but let's think about the question again. Alice asks, "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" So the expected answer is "it freezes" or "it becomes ice." But if the water is at -10°C, it's already frozen, so the answer would be "it is frozen." So Bob says "water freezes at -10 degrees," which is a statement about the freezing point, but the question is asking what happens at that temperature. So Bob's answer is a bit off. But if the question is "what happens to water at -10°C," the answer is "it is frozen," so Bob's statement "water freezes at -10°C" is incorrect because the freezing occurs at 0°C, but the water is frozen at -10°C. So Bob's answer is wrong, but he's claiming he's right.

Wait, but Bob says, "Yes, but I'm still right." So he's agreeing that the freezing point is 0°C, but he's still right about his original statement. So maybe he's interpreting the question differently. Like, if the question is "what happens to water at -10°C," and Bob says "water freezes at -10°C," but actually, the water would have frozen at 0°C, so at -10°C, it's already frozen. So the process of freezing happened at 0°C, but the state at -10°C is frozen. So Bob's statement is incorrect, but he's saying he's still right. Wait, maybe he's making a joke that since the water is frozen at -10°C, his statement "water freezes at -10°C" is correct in the sense that it's frozen there. But "freezes" is the process, not the state. So it's a common mistake, but technically incorrect.

Wait, but the key here is that Bob is wrong about the freezing point, but he's claiming he's still right. So maybe the trick is that Bob is correct in the context of the question. The question is "what happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius?" So the answer is that it's frozen. So Bob says "water freezes at -10 degrees," which is a misstatement, but if you take it as "water is frozen at -10 degrees," then it's correct. So Bob is using "freezes" instead of "is frozen," but he's still correct in the sense that the water is frozen at that temperature. So he's technically wrong in his wording, but the intended meaning is correct. So he's still right because the water is indeed frozen at -10°C, even though he phrased it as "freezes" instead of "is frozen."

Wait, but "freezes" is the verb for the process. So "water freezes at 0°C" means the process occurs at 0°C. "Water is frozen at -10°C" means the state is frozen at that temperature. So Bob's statement is incorrect because he used "freezes" instead of "is frozen." But if the question is asking what happens at -10°C, the answer is that it's frozen, so Bob's answer, while grammatically incorrect, is conveying the correct outcome. So maybe Bob is right in the sense that the water is frozen at -10°C, even though he said "freezes" instead of "is frozen." So he's technically wrong in the phrasing, but the answer he's giving (that it's frozen) is correct. So he's still right.

Wait, but the question is about who is right. Alice says water freezes at 0°C, which is correct. Bob says water freezes at -10°C, which is incorrect. But Bob says he's still right. So if Bob's statement is incorrect, but he's claiming he's right, then he's wrong. But maybe the trick is that Bob is correct in the context of the question. Let's parse the question again.

Alice asks: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" So the question is about the state of water at that temperature. The answer is "it is frozen." Bob answers: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius." So he's stating the freezing point as -10°C, which is wrong. But if the question was "what is the freezing point of water?" then Alice is correct. But the question is "what happens to water at -10°C," so the answer is "it freezes" (if it's cooling down to -10°C, but actually, if it's already at -10°C, it's frozen). Wait, but the question is "what happens to water at -10 degrees," so if you have water at -10°C, what is it doing? It's frozen. So the correct answer is "it is frozen," not "it freezes." So Bob's answer is wrong because he's saying "it freezes," which would mean the process is happening at -10°C, but the process happens at 0°C. So the correct answer to the question is "it is frozen," so Bob's answer is incorrect. But he's saying he's still right.

Wait, but maybe Bob is making a play on words. Like, "water freezes at -10°C" could be interpreted as "water is frozen at -10°C," so he's using "freezes" as a state, which is a common mistake. So in that case, he's technically wrong, but the intended meaning is correct, so he's still right. So the answer would be that Bob is right because the water is frozen at -10°C, even though he phrased it as "freezes" instead of "is frozen."

Wait, but the question is asking who is right. Alice says the freezing point is 0°C, which is correct. Bob says the freezing point is -10°C, which is wrong. But Bob claims he's still right. So if the question was about the freezing point, Alice is right. But the question was "what happens to water at -10°C," so the answer is that it's frozen. So Bob's answer, while misstated, is correct in the outcome. So Bob is right about what happens at -10°C (it's frozen), even though he incorrectly stated the freezing point. So Alice is correct about the freezing point, but Bob is correct about the state at -10°C. Wait, but the question was "what happens to water at -10 degrees," so Bob's answer is addressing the question, even if his phrasing is off. So Bob is right in answering the question, even though he made a mistake in the phrasing. So he's still right.

Wait, but the problem is that Bob's answer is "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius." So he's stating a fact about the freezing point, not answering the question. The question is "what happens to water at -10 degrees," so the answer should be "it freezes" or "it is frozen." But Bob is stating the freezing point as -10°C, which is a different question. So he's answering a different question. So Alice is correcting him on the freezing point, but Bob is answering the question incorrectly by stating the freezing point instead of the state. But he's claiming he's still right. So if the question was "what is the freezing point of water," Alice is right. But the question was "what happens to water at -10°C," so the answer is "it is frozen," so Bob's answer is wrong because he's stating the freezing point, but he's still right in the sense that the water is frozen at -10°C. Wait, but he said "water freezes at -10°C," which is a statement about the freezing point, not the state. So if he had said "water is frozen at -10°C," he'd be correct. But he said "freezes," so it's a mistake. However, in common language, people might say "water freezes at -10°C" meaning it's frozen there, even though it's technically incorrect. So Bob is using incorrect terminology but the intended meaning is correct, so he's still right.

So the answer would be that Bob is right because at -10°C, water is frozen, so his statement, while misphrased, correctly indicates the state of water at that temperature. Alice is correct about the freezing point being 0°C, but the question was about what happens at -10°C, not the freezing point. So Bob's answer, despite the wording, is correct for the question asked. Therefore, Bob is right.

Wait, but let's confirm. The question is "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?" So the answer is "it freezes" if it's cooling down to that temperature, but if it's already at -10°C, it's already frozen. So the correct answer is "it is frozen." Bob says "water freezes at -10 degrees," which would mean the process of freezing occurs at -10°C, which is wrong. But if he meant "water is frozen at -10 degrees," then it's correct. So the mistake is in the verb tense. So Bob's statement is grammatically incorrect, but the intended meaning is correct. So in the context of the question, he's right. So Bob is correct.

Therefore, the answer is that Bob is right because at -10°C, water is frozen, so his statement (though misphrased) correctly describes the state of water at that temperature.
</think>

Bob is correct. The question asks, "What happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius?" The answer is that **water is frozen** at that temperature. Bob's statement, "Water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius," is grammatically imprecise (since "freezes" refers to the *process* of turning to ice, which occurs at 0°C), but his intended meaning—that water is in a frozen state at -10°C—is accurate. Alice correctly states the *freezing point* (0°C), but the question was about the **state of water at -10°C**, not the freezing point. Thus, Bob's answer, while poorly phrased, correctly describes the outcome at that temperature. 

**Answer:** Bob is right because water is frozen at -10°C, even though his wording ("freezes") is technically incorrect for the freezing *point*. The question asked about the state at -10°C, not the freezing point. [end of text]
