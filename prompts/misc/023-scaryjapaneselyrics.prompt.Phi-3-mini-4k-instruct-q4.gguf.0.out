Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Give me your interpretation. You do not have to translate the contents, but you may if you wish.

The lyrics tell the story of a mischievous character who finds themselves in a whimsical, fantastical setting—a small, empty restaurant in the forest with a tin roof, where the staff play various musical instruments. The character, possibly a lost traveler or a curious wanderer, enters the restaurant and is greeted warmly.

The story begins with the character trying to find their way to Don't Go, a mysterious destination, but they keep getting lost in the forest. They stumble upon the small restaurant, which is empty except for a few chattering birds and the sound of music from the kitchen staff. The restaurant's menu consists of recommendations, but there are no reservations available.

As the character enters, they are welcomed with a cheerful "Welcome!" and are encouraged to indulge in the food, which is said to make them sleepy. The character is then invited to dance with the staff, including a bear cub and a group of playful animals.

The lyrics continue with the character being led further into the restaurant, which seems to be a place where people come to find rest and relaxation. The restaurant is described as a final destination, a place where one can find peace and tranquility before the end of the world.

In a literal interpretation, the restaurant could be a magical haven for weary travelers, where they can find respite and enjoyment in the company of friendly animals and enchanting music. The fantastical setting allows for a unique interpretation of the story, where the characters and events are not bound by reality but instead embrace the whimsy and charm of a magical world.<|end|>
