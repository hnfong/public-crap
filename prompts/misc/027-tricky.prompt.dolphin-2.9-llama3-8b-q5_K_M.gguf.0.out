Answer the following questions with brief explanations.

A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?
B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?

A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure.

B) If a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius (8 degrees Fahrenheit), it will still be in a liquid state. However, at this temperature, the water will be very cold and potentially start to form ice crystals if the cooling continues. Water can supercool, meaning it can remain a liquid below its freezing point, but this is not guaranteed and depends on various factors such as purity and agitation. [end of text]
