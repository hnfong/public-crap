<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to interpret the story told by the lyrics. The user says: "Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical." So we need to provide an interpretation of the story. The lyrics are whimsical, referencing a forest small restaurant, no reservations, empty seats, birds laughing, a tin roof painted red, menu recommended, kitchen with violin, flute, cello, viola. Welcome, eat too much and sleep, goodbye, tomorrow is tomorrow, etc. Then "right to left, oh wow, a hand-ride child bear dancing, carpaccio, paella, hors d'oeuvres, risotto, no dessert, deliver to the grave, tonight is the last full course." So it's a whimsical, maybe a ghostly restaurant in a forest that serves food to the dead? The mention of "deliver to the grave" suggests maybe it's a funeral restaurant? The "hand-ride child bear" dancing could be a childlike bear that rides a hand? Or a "hand-ride" meaning "hand-ride" as in "hand-ride" like a small child? The "right to left" maybe referencing Japanese writing direction? The "red tin roof" maybe a sign. The "menu is recommended" maybe "recommended dish" is the only dish. The "no reservations" maybe it's a place that appears spontaneously. The "empty seats" maybe it's a ghostly place. The "birds laughing" maybe the birds are the ghosts. The "violin, flute, cello, viola" maybe the kitchen is playing music. The "tarfuk" maybe "tarfuk" is a mis-typo? "たらふく" maybe "tarafuku"? Not sure. "お墓の中まで届けましょう" deliver to the grave. "今宵は最後のフルコース" tonight is the last full course. So maybe it's a restaurant that serves the dead their last meal before they go to the afterlife. The "hand-ride child bear" might be a small child bear that rides a hand? Or a "hand-ride" meaning "hand-ride" as in "hand-ride" like a "hand-ride" of a small child? Or "hand-ride" might be "hand-ride" as in "hand-ride" like "hand-ride" of a small child? Not sure.

We need to interpret the story. The user says "Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical." So we need to propose a literal interpretation: maybe it's a magical forest restaurant that appears to wanderers, no reservations, but you can find it by following acorns. The "acorn" leads to the restaurant. The "empty pockets" maybe you have nothing to pay. The "forgotten person" maybe a lost traveler. The "menu" is recommended dish. The "kitchen" has musical instruments. The "hand-ride child bear" maybe a small bear that rides a hand? Or a "hand-ride" meaning "hand-ride" as in "hand-ride" like "hand-ride" of a small child? The "right to left" maybe referencing Japanese writing direction. The "deliver to the grave" maybe the restaurant is in a cemetery. The "last full course" maybe it's the last meal before death. So the story: a wanderer follows acorns to a hidden forest restaurant that serves the dead their last meal. The restaurant has no reservations, but you can find it by following acorns. The menu is recommended dish only. The kitchen is playing music. The birds laugh. The hand-ride child bear dancing. The restaurant is in a cemetery. The last full course is delivered to the grave. The narrator invites you to eat and sleep. The next day is tomorrow. So it's a whimsical, slightly mischievous story about a magical restaurant that serves the dead.

We can also interpret it as a metaphor for a "night shift" at a small restaurant that serves "ghosts" (customers who are not physically present). The "acorn" might be a clue to find the restaurant. The "empty pockets" might be a metaphor for being broke. The "forgotten person" might be a lost soul. The "no reservations" might be a place that only accepts those who need it. The "red tin roof" might be a sign. The "menu recommended" might be a "recommended dish" that is the only dish. The "kitchen" with instruments might be a "kitchen orchestra" that plays music. The "hand-ride child bear" might be a "hand-ride" as in "hand-ride" of a small child. The "right to left" might be a direction. The "deliver to the grave" might be a "delivery to the grave" meaning the restaurant is in a cemetery. The "last full course" might be the last meal before death. So the story: a wanderer finds a hidden forest restaurant that serves the dead their last meal, with a magical atmosphere.

We can also interpret it as a "fantasy world" where the restaurant is a "portal" to the afterlife. The "acorn" is a key. The "empty pockets" is a sign that you don't need money. The "forgotten person" is a lost soul. The "no reservations" means it's open to all. The "red tin roof" is a sign. The "menu recommended" is the only dish. The "kitchen" with instruments is a "kitchen orchestra" that plays music. The "hand-ride child bear" is a "child bear" that rides a hand. The "right to left" is a direction. The "deliver to the grave" is a "delivery to the grave" meaning the restaurant is in a cemetery. The "last full course" is the last meal before death. So the story: a wanderer enters a magical forest restaurant that serves the dead their last meal, with a whimsical atmosphere.
