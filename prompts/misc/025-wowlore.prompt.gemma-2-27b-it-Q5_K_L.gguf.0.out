* **E** - Elwynn Forest
* **F** - Felwood
* **G** - Gadgetzan
* **H** - Hillsbrad Foothills
* **I** - Ironforge
* **J** -  Jade Forest (This one is tricky! It's technically introduced in Mists of Pandaria, but the Jade Serpent statue in the Valley of the Four Winds is a nod to it.)
* **K** - Kharanos
* **L** - Loch Modan
* **M** - Mulgore
* **N** -  Northern Stranglethorn
* **O** - Orgrimmar

* **T** - Tirisfal Glades
* **U** - Undercity
* **V** -  Vanilla WoW doesn't have many "V" locations. Perhaps a Village in Elwynn Forest?
* **W** - Westfall
* **X** -  There aren't many "X" locations. Perhaps a hidden X-marked treasure spot?
* **Y** -  You can find a "Y" in the name of the town of "Yar'gul" in Stonetalon Mountains.
