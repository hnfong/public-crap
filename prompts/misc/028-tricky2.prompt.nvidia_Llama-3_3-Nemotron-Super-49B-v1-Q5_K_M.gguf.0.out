A delightful example of a conversational conundrum!

**Who is right?**
Alice is **more accurate** in the context of standard conditions, while Bob's statement has a nuanced, albeit less common, interpretation.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice is right (under standard conditions)**: Under standard atmospheric pressure, pure water freezes at 0°C (32°F). This is a widely accepted scientific fact. At -10°C, water would indeed be frozen under these conditions.
* **Bob's possible (yet misleading) interpretation**:
	+ **Supercooling**: If water is **supercooled** (cooled below its freezing point without ice forming), it can remain in a liquid state below 0°C. However, this is not a stable state, and any disturbance would cause it to rapidly freeze. Bob's statement doesn't mention supercooling, making this interpretation unlikely.
	+ **Non-standard conditions or additives**: In the presence of certain substances (e.g., antifreeze, high concentrations of salts) or under extreme pressure, water can freeze at temperatures lower than 0°C. Again, Bob's statement doesn't provide this context.

**Verdict**:
Given the lack of context for non-standard conditions in Bob's statement, **Alice is right** in the general sense. Bob's assertion is misleading without further clarification, making Alice's correction accurate for most practical purposes.

**Polite Conversation Continuation Suggestion**:
Alice: "I think there might be some confusion. Water typically freezes at 0°C under standard conditions. Were you considering a specific scenario where it might freeze at -10°C?"
(Bob could then clarify if there was a particular context in mind, leading to a more informative conversation.) [end of text]
