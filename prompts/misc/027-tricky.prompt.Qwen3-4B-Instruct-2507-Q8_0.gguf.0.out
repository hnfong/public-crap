A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius.  
Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure. At -12°C, which is below the freezing point, water will freeze, but only if it is at or below 0°C and under normal conditions. So, the statement is misleading — water *will* freeze at -12°C, but the freezing point is not *at* -12°C; it's *below* that.

B) If a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12°C, it will freeze completely into ice.  
Since -12°C is below the freezing point of water (0°C), the water molecules will slow down and form a solid crystalline structure (ice). Pure water will freeze at 0°C under normal conditions, and at -12°C, it will freeze more readily and completely, forming solid ice.  

✅ Summary:  
A) No — water freezes at 0°C, not at -12°C.  
B) The water will freeze into ice. [end of text]
