 A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of pure water is 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. However, certain conditions such as the presence of impurities or supercooling can alter this temperature.

B) If a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius, it should freeze and turn into ice. This is because the temperature is 12 degrees below the freezing point of water. However, if the water is extremely pure and there are no nucleation sites (like dust particles), the water can get supercooled and remain liquid below 0 degrees Celsius. But once disturbed, it will quickly freeze. [end of text]
