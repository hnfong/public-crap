**Verse 1:**  
Yo, listen up, let me break it down,  
Fedâ€™s the big dog keepinâ€™ the economy in town.  
They control the cash flow, like a DJ spins tracks,  
Keepinâ€™ inflation low, so your money donâ€™t crack.  

**Chorus:**  
Federal Reserve, yeah, they run the show,  
Printinâ€™ bills, settinâ€™ rates, lettinâ€™ the dough flow.  
When times get tough, they step in the game,  
Keepinâ€™ the economy lit, never the same!  

**Verse 2:**  
They got the power to raise or drop rates,  
Like a beat switch, changinâ€™ economic fates.  
Low rates mean loans are cheap, businesses expand,  
High rates cool things off, like a fan in your hand.  

**Bridge:**  
When the marketâ€™s shakinâ€™, they got your back,  
Injectinâ€™ liquidity, no need to attack.  
Theyâ€™re like the referee in this financial game,  
Makinâ€™ sure the rules stay fair, no foul, no shame.  

**Chorus:**  
Federal Reserve, yeah, they run the show,  
Printinâ€™ bills, settinâ€™ rates, lettinâ€™ the dough flow.  
When times get tough, they step in the game,  
Keepinâ€™ the economy lit, never the same!  

**Verse 3:**  
They watch over banks, make sure they play nice,  
No shady deals, keepinâ€™ your savings safe and tight.  
Theyâ€™re the silent partner in this money machine,  
Keepinâ€™ the wheels turninâ€™, always on the scene.  

**Outro:**  
So next time you stack paper, remember the Fed,  
Theyâ€™re the ones keepinâ€™ the game fair, no need to dread.  
Federal Reserve, the name you should know,  
Keepinâ€™ the economy strong, lettinâ€™ the money grow!
