 <用户>Answer the following questions with brief explanations.

A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?
B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?

<AI> A) Water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit).

B) If you have a glass of pure water and cool it down to -12 degrees Celsius, the water will not freeze. However, it will become a supercooled liquid, which is a state where the water is below its freezing point but still retains its liquid properties. This is because the water molecules are still moving and have not yet formed a solid structure. If you were to increase the temperature of the supercooled liquid, it would eventually freeze.
