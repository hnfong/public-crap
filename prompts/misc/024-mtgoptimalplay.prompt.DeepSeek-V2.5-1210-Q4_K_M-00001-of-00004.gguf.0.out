### Understanding the Situation

First, let's break down the scenario to ensure we have all the necessary information:

- **Alice's Hand:** Two copies of 'Kindle'.
- **Kindle's Effect:** Deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards.
- **Bob's Board:** Orim, Samite Healer (1/3), untapped.
- **Orim's Ability:** Tap: Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.
- **Current Turn:** Alice's turn.
- **Mana Availability:** Alice has sufficient mana to cast any spells; Bob's lands are tapped out.

### Alice's Objective

Alice wants to kill Orim to neutralize a significant threat to her burn deck. To achieve this, she needs to maximize the damage dealt to Orim using her Kindle spells.

### Bob's Objective

Bob wants to keep Orim alive as long as possible to prevent Alice from dealing damage to his other creatures or himself. He can use Orim's ability to prevent damage, but he must decide when and how to use it optimally.

### Analyzing Kindle's Effect

Kindle's damage calculation is based on the number of Kindle cards in all graveyards. Since Alice has two Kindle cards in her hand and no Kindle cards in any graveyard yet, the initial damage calculation would be:

- **Initial X Value:** 2 (base) + 0 (no Kindle in graveyards) = 2 damage.

However, if Alice casts both Kindle spells, the first Kindle will go to the graveyard, increasing the X value for the second Kindle:

- **After First Kindle:** X = 2 + 1 = 3 damage.
- **After Second Kindle:** X = 2 + 2 = 4 damage.

### Potential Plays for Alice

Alice has two main options:

1. **Cast One Kindle:**
   - Deals 2 damage to Orim.
   - Orim survives with 1 toughness remaining.
   - No Kindle in graveyard for future turns.

2. **Cast Both Kindles:**
   - First Kindle deals 2 damage (Orim survives with 1 toughness).
   - Second Kindle deals 4 damage (Orim dies).

### Bob's Response

Bob has Orim's ability to prevent the next 3 damage to any target this turn. He needs to decide whether to use this ability before or after Alice casts her Kindle spells.

- **If Bob Uses Orim's Ability Before Alice Casts:**
  - Prevents up to 3 damage from the first Kindle.
  - Since the first Kindle deals 2 damage, Orim survives.
  - The second Kindle deals 4 damage, but Orim's ability is already used, so Orim dies.

- **If Bob Uses Orim's Ability After Alice Casts the First Kindle:**
  - First Kindle deals 2 damage (Orim survives).
  - Bob uses Orim's ability to prevent the next 3 damage from the second Kindle.
  - Second Kindle deals 4 damage, but 3 are prevented, so Orim takes 1 damage and survives.

### Optimal Play for Alice

Given the above analysis, Alice's optimal play is to cast both Kindle spells in sequence. This maximizes the total damage dealt to Orim, ensuring that Orim dies regardless of when Bob uses his prevention ability.

### Optimal Play for Bob

Bob's optimal play is to use Orim's ability after Alice casts the first Kindle. This way, he prevents 3 damage from the second Kindle, allowing Orim to survive with 1 toughness remaining.

### Final Outcome

- **Alice Casts Both Kindles:**
  - First Kindle deals 2 damage (Orim survives with 1 toughness).
  - Bob uses Orim's ability to prevent 3 damage from the second Kindle.
  - Second Kindle deals 4 damage, but 3 are prevented, so Orim takes 1 damage and survives.

**Result:** Orim survives with 1 toughness remaining.

### Summary of Thought Process

1. **Alice's Strategy:**
   - Maximize damage to Orim by casting both Kindle spells.
   - Understand that the second Kindle will deal 4 damage due to the first Kindle being in the graveyard.

2. **Bob's Strategy:**
   - Use Orim's ability to prevent damage from the second Kindle.
   - Decide to use the ability after the first Kindle to ensure Orim survives.

3. **Game Mechanics Considerations:**
   - Kindle's damage calculation based on graveyard count.
   - Orim's ability to prevent damage, which can be used once per turn.

By carefully analyzing the abilities and potential plays, both players can make informed decisions to achieve their objectives within the game's rules. [end of text]
