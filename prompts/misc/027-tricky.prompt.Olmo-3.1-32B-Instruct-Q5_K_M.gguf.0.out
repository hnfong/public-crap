A) **Yes, water freezes at -12 degrees Celsius.**  
Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. At -12°C, which is well below the freezing point, water will be in a solid (ice) state if it has already reached 0°C and been cooled further.

B) **If a glass of pure water is cooled to -12°C, it will be solid ice.**  
Initially, as the water is cooled from above 0°C to 0°C, it will begin to freeze. Once the temperature drops below 0°C, any remaining liquid water will continue to freeze until all the water is solid. At -12°C, the glass will contain only ice, not liquid water. (Note: This assumes the water is not supercooled and that normal atmospheric pressure is present.) [end of text]
