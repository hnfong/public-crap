🐷👨‍👨‍👦 Three little pigs left home to build their own houses. 🏠

🐷 The first pig was lazy. 🐔 He met a 🐔 chicken who sold straw. "This is easy!" 🐷 said. He quickly built a house of straw. 😴

🐷 The second pig was a bit better. 🌳 He met a 🐿️ squirrel who sold sticks. "This is stronger," 🐷 thought. He built a house of sticks. 🤔

🐷 The third pig was hardworking. 🧱 He met a 🐻 bear who sold bricks. "This will take time, but it's worth it," 🐷 said. He built a sturdy house of bricks. 💪

🐺 Suddenly, a big bad wolf appeared! 👹 He saw the first pig's straw house. "Little pig, little pig, let me in!" 🐺 demanded.

"No! Not by the hair on my chinny chin chin!" 🐷 replied.

"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in!" 🐺 threatened.

The wolf huffed and puffed. 💨💨 The straw house fell down! 🏠💥 The first pig ran to his brother's house. 😨

The wolf went to the stick house. "Little pigs, little pigs, let me in!" 🐺

"No!" they said together.

"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in!" 🐺

The wolf huffed and puffed. 💨💨 The stick house fell down! 🏠💥 The two pigs ran to the brick house. 😨😨

The wolf was angry! 🤬 He went to the brick house. "Little pigs, little pigs, let me in!" 🐺

"No!" they said bravely.

"Then I'll huff, and I'll puff, and I'll blow your house in!" 🐺

The wolf huffed and puffed and puffed and puffed. 💨💨💨💨 But the brick house didn't fall! 💪🏠 The wolf couldn't break in.

The wolf got clever. 🧠 He climbed onto the roof. 🏠⬆️ He tried to slide down the chimney. 🧑‍🔧⬇️

But the smart pigs had a pot of boiling water below! 🍲☕️

The wolf slid down the chimney... 🧑‍🔧⬇️

...right into the pot! 🍲😬

The pigs cheered! 🎉🎉 The wolf ran away, never to return. 😈💨

And the three little pigs lived happily ever after in their strong brick house. 🏠💖🎉 [end of text]
