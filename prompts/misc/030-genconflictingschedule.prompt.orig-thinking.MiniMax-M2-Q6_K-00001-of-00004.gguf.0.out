I need to create a CSV with 30 rows that includes columns for Event Name, Start Date, Start Time, End Date, and End Time. The dates should be random and not sorted, covering the 2020s. I’ll ensure some events conflict by overlapping in time. After generating the rows, I’ll list the conflicting events and explain why they overlap. I’ll also make sure the CSV is properly formatted with headers and consistent date/time values.

I need to ensure that the end time is after the start time for each event. I’ll create a list of event names, like "Team Standup" and "Product Launch," and assign random dates and times. I want to include some conflicts, so I’ll intentionally overlap certain events. After generating the 30 rows, I’ll identify which events conflict and explain why. I’ll also make sure the dates are in the 2020s and not sorted, while keeping the CSV format simple.
