Both Alice and Bob are correct, but they are referring to different contexts.

Alice is correct in stating that pure water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm).

Bob is also correct because water can freeze at temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius. In fact, water can remain in a supercooled state (liquid) below its freezing point until it is disturbed or a seed crystal is introduced, at which point it will rapidly freeze. So, at -10 degrees Celsius, water will indeed freeze, even though the freezing point of pure water is 0 degrees Celsius. [end of text]
