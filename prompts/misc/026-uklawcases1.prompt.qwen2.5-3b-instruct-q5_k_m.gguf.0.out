### Case Descriptions

#### R v Cunningham (1957)
**Background:** This case involved a man named Cunningham who was convicted of theft. He appealed his conviction, arguing that the evidence against him was insufficient. The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, but the House of Lords (the highest court in the UK at the time) overturned it. The case was significant because it established the principle that the prosecution must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the jury must be given a fair and complete picture of the evidence.

#### R v Caldwell (1967)
**Background:** Caldwell was convicted of murder and appealed, arguing that the jury was not properly instructed on the law of self-defense. The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, but the House of Lords overturned it. The case was significant because it clarified the jury's role in interpreting the law and the importance of proper legal instructions.

#### R v G (1968)
**Background:** G was convicted of murder and appealed, arguing that the jury was not properly instructed on the law of provocation. The Court of Appeal upheld the conviction, but the House of Lords overturned it. The case was significant because it further clarified the jury's role in interpreting the law and the importance of proper legal instructions.
