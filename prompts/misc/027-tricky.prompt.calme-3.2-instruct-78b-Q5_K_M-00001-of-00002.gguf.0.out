A) No, under standard atmospheric pressure, water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, not -12 degrees. The misconception might arise due to the fact that the freezing point can be lowered by the presence of impurities (like in saltwater) or under specific conditions like supercooling.

B) Under normal circumstances, pure water should freeze at 0 degrees Celsius. If it's cooled down to -12 degrees without freezing (a state called supercooling), it's due to the absence of nucleation sites for ice crystal formation. A slight disturbance, like introducing a solid particle, would cause the water to freeze rapidly. However, in most practical situations, water will not supercool to -12 degrees due to the presence of dust or other impurities that act as nucleation sites. [end of text]
