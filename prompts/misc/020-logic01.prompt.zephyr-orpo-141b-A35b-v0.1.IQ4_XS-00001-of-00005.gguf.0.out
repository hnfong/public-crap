If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

A theory that proves itself is typically referred to as a "consistent" theory, as it demonstrates that it does not lead to any contradictions. The term "tautological" is more commonly used in logic to describe a statement that is always true, regardless of the truth values of its constituent propositions. However, the concept of tautology can also be extended to theories or systems, in which case it refers to a theory that is true by definition or redundant in its formulation.

Examples of consistent theories that prove themselves include:

1. Peano Arithmetic: This is a formal axiomatic system for the natural numbers, developed by the Italian mathematician Giuseppe Peano. It includes axioms such as the existence of zero, the successor function, and the principle of mathematical induction. Peano Arithmetic can prove its own consistency within a stronger system, such as second-order arithmetic or set theory.
2. Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC): This is a widely accepted axiomatic system for set theory, developed by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel. It includes axioms such as the axiom of extensionality, the axiom of regularity, and the axiom of choice. ZFC can prove its own consistency within a stronger system, such as a system with additional large cardinal axioms.

Keep in mind that, according to GÃ¶del's Incompleteness Theorems, no consistent axiomatic system that is strong enough to include arithmetic can prove its own consistency using only the resources of the system itself. In other words, if a theory proves its own consistency, it must do so by using a stronger system.</s>
