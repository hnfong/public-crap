Let's break down the command and its components to understand the probable output:

1. `cat wowfanfic.txt` - Outputs the contents of the file
2. `perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'` - Splits the input into words and prints each word on a new line
3. `sort` - Sorts the words alphabetically
4. `uniq -c` - Counts occurrences of each word (requires sorted input)
5. `sort -n` - Sorts the counts numerically
6. `tail -n 20` - Shows only the last 20 lines (most frequent words)

The output would likely be:
- The 20 most frequent words from the fan fiction
- Each line showing the count followed by the word
- The words would be in descending order of frequency

Linguistically, this would reflect:
1. **Zipf's Law** - The most frequent words would be function words (the, and, of, etc.) followed by content words
2. **Lexical Density** - The most frequent words would be lower-frequency content words that are central to the Warcraft universe (e.g., "orc", "dragon", "Azeroth")
3. **Semantic Fields** - The words would cluster around Warcraft's fantasy themes (magic, battle, races, locations)
4. **Collocations** - Common word pairs might appear frequently (e.g., "heroic death", "ancient artifact")

The exact output would depend on the specific content of the fan fiction, but it would generally show:
- High counts for function words
- Mid-range counts for Warcraft-specific terms
- Lower counts for unique proper nouns and rare words

This analysis demonstrates how computational methods can reveal linguistic patterns in creative writing, showing both universal tendencies (like Zipf's Law) and domain-specific preferences (Warcraft terminology). The output would be a quantitative linguistic profile of the fan fiction's vocabulary usage. [end of text]
