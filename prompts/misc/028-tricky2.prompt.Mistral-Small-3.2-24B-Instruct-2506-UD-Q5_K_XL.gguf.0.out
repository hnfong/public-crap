Bob is correct. While it is true that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure, it can remain in a liquid state at lower temperatures if it is pure and free of impurities. This is known as supercooling. However, in most practical situations, water will freeze at 0 degrees Celsius or higher due to the presence of impurities or nucleation sites. So, Bob's statement is technically accurate, but Alice's statement is more commonly true under normal conditions. [end of text]
