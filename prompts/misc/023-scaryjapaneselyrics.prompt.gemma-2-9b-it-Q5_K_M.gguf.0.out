Here are some lyrics for a Japanese song. The melody is lighthearted and slightly mischievous.

Let me know what is the story the lyrics tell. Even though the theme is fantastical as you will see, there should be at least one interpretation that makes literal sense in a fantastical setting, and it is not just metaphorical.

ドングリを辿っても着きません
森の小さなレストラン
空っぽのポケットを弄って
忘れた人から辿り着く
予約は一つもありません
森の小さなレストラン
空席だらけのランチ時
小鳥がパタパタ笑ってる

真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根
メニューはおすすめ そればかり
厨房の方から聞こえてる
バイオリン フルート チェロ ビオラ

ようこそようこそ いらっしゃい
たらふく食べたらお眠りよ
それでは皆さんさようなら
明日は明日で エトセトラ

右から左へおおわらわ
手乗りの子熊も踊り出す
カルパッチョ パエリア オードブル
リゾット デザートはありません
お墓の中まで届けましょう
今宵は最後のフルコース

Give me your interpretation. You do not have to translate the contents, but you may if you wish.

The lyrics paint a picture of a whimsical, hidden restaurant in the forest. 

Here's a possible interpretation:

**Literal Interpretation:**

The song describes a magical restaurant in a forest, accessible only to those who are "forgotten" or perhaps those who have lost something important (symbolized by the empty pockets).  

* **The restaurant is always empty:** Despite being open, there are no reservations and no customers during lunch. The only company is the laughter of birds, suggesting a sense of isolation and perhaps a touch of melancholy.
* **The food is magical:** The menu is limited to a single "recommendation," and the music coming from the kitchen is a symphony of unusual instruments. This hints at a fantastical culinary experience.
* **The atmosphere is playful and slightly sinister:** The invitation to "eat until you sleep" and the mention of delivering food "to the grave" suggest a playful but potentially dangerous element to the restaurant.

**The "forgotten" guests:**

The guests who arrive are likely those who have been forgotten by the world, perhaps lost souls or those who have lost their way. The restaurant offers them a temporary escape and a final, extravagant meal before they move on.

**The mischievous tone:**

The lighthearted melody and the playful lyrics suggest a mischievous spirit at work. The restaurant might be a trickster's den, offering a tempting but ultimately illusory experience.
