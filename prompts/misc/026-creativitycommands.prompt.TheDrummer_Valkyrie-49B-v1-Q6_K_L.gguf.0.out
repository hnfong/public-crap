The command you've written is a common Linux pipeline used to count the frequency of each word in a text file and display the top 20 most frequent words. Let's break down what each part does:

1. `cat wowfanfic.txt`: This reads the contents of your fan fiction file and outputs it to the standard output.

2. `perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'`: 
   - `perl` invokes the Perl interpreter.
   - `-n` tells Perl to process the input line by line.
   - `-e` specifies the Perl code to execute.
   - `@a = split(/\s/)` splits each line into an array `@a` using whitespace (`\s`) as the delimiter. This effectively splits the line into individual words.
   - `foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }` loops through each word in the array and prints it on a new line. This is essentially the same as `print join("\n", @a)`.

3. `sort`: This sorts the output alphabetically by default. Since the output is one word per line, it sorts the words alphabetically.

4. `uniq -c`: 
   - `uniq` removes consecutive duplicate lines.
   - `-c` counts the number of consecutive occurrences of each line and prepends the count to each line.

5. `sort -n`: 
   - `sort` sorts the output again.
   - `-n` sorts numerically instead of lexicographically. This sorts the lines by the count (the number at the beginning of each line).

6. `tail -n 20`: Displays the last 20 lines of the sorted output, which will be the 20 most frequent words.

In terms of linguistic principles:

- **Tokenization**: The `split(/\s/)` in Perl is a basic form of tokenization, breaking the text into individual words or tokens based on whitespace. More sophisticated tokenization might handle punctuation differently.

- **Stop words**: Common words like "the", "and", "a", etc. are likely to be at the top of the frequency list. In linguistic analysis, these are often considered "stop words" and may be filtered out for more meaningful results.

- **Word frequency**: The command demonstrates the principle that in any corpus of text, a small number of words tend to occur very frequently, while most words occur rarely. This is related to Zipf's Law.

- **Alphabetical vs. numerical sorting**: The two `sort` commands demonstrate the difference between sorting lexicographically (alphabetically) and numerically. The first `sort` arranges words alphabetically, while the second `sort -n` arranges them by their frequency count.

So, the probable output will be a list of the 20 most frequent words in your fan fiction, along with their counts, sorted from least to most frequent. The actual words will depend on the content of your story, but you can expect to see common function words at the top. [end of text]
