Both Alice and Bob are partially right, but Bob's answer is contextually correct.

- Alice is correct that **water freezes at 0°C** under standard atmospheric pressure. That is the freezing point.
- However, Bob says, "It freezes" at -10°C, which is also **correct** because at -10°C, water is below its freezing point and will be in solid form (ice). So, any liquid water present would freeze.

Thus, **Bob is right** that water freezes (or is frozen) at -10°C, even though the actual phase change occurs at 0°C. The statement "it freezes" can reasonably mean "it turns to ice" or "it is in frozen state" at that temperature.

✅ Final answer: **Bob is right**, and Alice is clarifying the freezing point, but Bob's statement is accurate in context. [end of text]
