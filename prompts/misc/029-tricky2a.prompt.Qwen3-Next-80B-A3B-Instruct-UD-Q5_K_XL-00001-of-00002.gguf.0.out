Bob is right — *in context*.

Alice is factually correct that water freezes at 0°C under standard atmospheric pressure. But Bob says, “I’m still right,” implying he’s referring to a real-world scenario: at -10°C, water *has already frozen*. So while Alice states the freezing *point* (0°C), Bob is describing the *state* of water at -10°C — which is indeed frozen.

So Bob is *practically* right: at -10°C, water is frozen. He didn’t claim freezing *starts* at -10°C — just that water *is* frozen there. So he’s right in context.
