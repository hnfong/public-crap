This is the story of **Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs**!

Here's the breakdown:
- 👸🏡👨‍👩‍👧‍👦👑😠 = Evil Queen/stepmother jealous of Snow White
- 👸🪞✨👸🏻👑 = "Mirror, mirror on the wall" — the Queen learns Snow White is fairest
- 👸🏻👿🍎⚰️ = Snow White poisoned by apple, falls into death-like sleep
- 🐻🐿️🐦👸😴 = Seven Dwarfs (represented by animals/forest creatures) watch over her sleeping body
- 🤴😘💍👸💖 = Prince's kiss wakes her, they marry happily

This is Disney's first animated feature film (1937), based on the Brothers Grimm fairy tale. It's one of the most iconic stories in Western popular culture — referenced everywhere from *Shrek* to *Once Upon a Time* to countless "poison apple" and "true love's kiss" tropes in TV, film, and advertising.
