Looking at this Linux command pipeline step by step:

**Command breakdown:**
1. `cat wowfanfic.txt` - outputs the entire file content
2. `perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'` - splits on whitespace and prints each word on a separate line
3. `sort` - sorts all words alphabetically
4. `uniq -c` - counts consecutive duplicate lines and prefixes each line with the count
5. `sort -n` - sorts numerically by count (ascending)
6. `tail -n 20` - shows the last 20 lines (highest frequency words)

**Probable output:**
The output would show the 20 most frequently occurring words from the fan fiction, displayed as:
```
<count> <word>
<count> <word>
...
```

**Linguistic explanation:**

This command performs a **frequency analysis** of the text, which is fundamental in computational linguistics. The process demonstrates several key principles:

1. **Tokenization** - Breaking text into individual words (splitting on whitespace)
2. **Lexical analysis** - Identifying and counting distinct vocabulary items
3. **Statistical linguistics** - Measuring word frequency distributions

The output would likely show common function words like "the", "and", "of", "to", "a", "in", "is", "it", "that", "was", "for", "on", "with", "as", "by", "this", "are", "from", "at", "be" appearing with high frequencies (100-500+ occurrences), since these are grammatical words that appear frequently in English text.

The sorting by frequency reveals the **lexical frequency distribution** - a fundamental concept in linguistics showing that a small number of words account for a large portion of text usage (Zipf's law). The final 20 results represent the most common words in the fan fiction, which would typically include both grammatical function words and potentially some recurring character names or thematic terms from the WoW context.

This type of analysis is commonly used in corpus linguistics to understand language patterns and vocabulary usage. [end of text]
