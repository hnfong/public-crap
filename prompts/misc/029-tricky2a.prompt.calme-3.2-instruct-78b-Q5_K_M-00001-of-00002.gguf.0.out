In this context, Bob is technically correct but his statement is misleading. At 0 degrees Celsius, water typically transitions from a liquid to a solid state, forming ice, under standard atmospheric pressure. At -10 degrees Celsius, under normal conditions, water should be in a solid state, as it would have already frozen. However, in specialized conditions, such as in the presence of supercooling, water can exist as a liquid below 0 degrees Celsius, but this is an exception and not the norm. Bob's statement implies that water only freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, which is an oversimplification. Alice is correct in her clarification that the freezing point of water is at 0 degrees Celsius, not -10 degrees Celsius. [end of text]
