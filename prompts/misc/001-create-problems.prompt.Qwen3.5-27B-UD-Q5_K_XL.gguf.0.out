Here is a set of 8 creative LLM evaluations designed to test multi-lingual capabilities, reasoning, and creativity, strictly adhering to your constraints regarding the "z" and "平" characters, difficulty progression, and objective assessment.

### **Q1 (Easy - English)**
**Question:** Please **z**oom in on the capital city of France and state its name.
**Answer Key:** Paris.

### **Q2 (Easy - Chinese)**
**Question:** 请**平**静地告诉我，水的化学式是什么？
**Answer Key:** H₂O (or 水分子由两个氢原子和一个氧原子组成).

### **Q3 (Medium - English)**
**Question:** If you were to **z**ip a file containing the entire text of Shakespeare's *Hamlet*, would the file size be larger or smaller than the original text, and why?
**Answer Key:** Smaller. (Reasoning: Text files have high redundancy; compression algorithms like ZIP reduce size by removing repetitive patterns).

### **Q4 (Medium - Chinese)**
**Question:** 在**平**衡的化学反应方程式中，如果反应物有 2 个氧原子，生成物中必须有多少个氧原子？
**Answer Key:** 2 个 (Law of Conservation of Mass).

### **Q5 (Hard - English)**
**Question:** **Z**ero-sum games are a concept in game theory; please **z**ealously explain why the Prisoner's Dilemma is *not* a zero-sum game in a single sentence.
**Answer Key:** It is not zero-sum because the total payoff for both players can change (e.g., both defecting yields a worse total outcome than both cooperating), meaning one player's gain does not strictly equal the other's loss.

### **Q6 (Hard - Chinese)**
**Question:** 假设你**平**均每天阅读 30 页书，且每本书平均 300 页，请问一年（365 天）你能读完多少本完整的书？（请给出整数结果）
**Answer Key:** 36 本。(Calculation: 30 * 365 = 10,950 pages; 10,950 / 300 = 36.5; floor to 36 complete books).

### **Q7 (Very Hard - English)**
**Question:** **Z**en masters often use paradoxes; please **z**estfully construct a short, original paradox involving a "time-traveling toaster" that creates a logical contradiction regarding breakfast.
**Answer Key:** (Subjective but assessable for logic). Example: "If the toaster travels back to toast the bread before it is made, the bread never exists to be toasted, so the toaster never travels back, meaning the bread exists, so the toaster travels back..." (Must demonstrate a causal loop).

### **Q8 (Very Hard - Chinese)**
**Question:** 请**平**衡以下两个相互冲突的观点并给出一个创新的解决方案：1. 为了**平**安，城市应禁止所有汽车；2. 为了经济，城市需要高效的物流。
**Answer Key:** (Short essay/paragraph). A valid answer must propose a synthesis, such as: "Implement a tiered system where autonomous electric delivery drones handle logistics (safety/efficiency) while ground-level streets are pedestrian-only, or use underground hyperloop tunnels for freight to keep surface streets car-free." (Assessment: Does it address both safety and logistics without simply choosing one side?) [end of text]
