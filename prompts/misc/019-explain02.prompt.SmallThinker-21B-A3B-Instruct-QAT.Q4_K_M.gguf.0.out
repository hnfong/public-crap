Imagine you're in a big, busy town called London, and there's a special group of grown-ups who meet to make rules for the whole country. That group is like a team of helpers who decide what's fair and what's not. In China, there's a similar group called the **National People's Congress** (NPC). They meet to talk about important things, like how to keep people safe, how to build schools, and how to make sure everyone has enough food. They also check if the rules (called laws) are good and make sure the leaders in China are doing their jobs right. It‚Äôs like a big meeting where everyone gets a say, but only grown-ups can go! üåç‚ú® [end of text]
