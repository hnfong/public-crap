A) Yes, water does freeze at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) at standard atmospheric pressure. However, water can freeze at lower temperatures under certain conditions, such as high pressure or the presence of impurities.

B) If you have a glass of pure water and cool it down to -12 degrees Celsius, the water will begin to freeze. The water molecules will slow down and arrange themselves into a crystalline structure, forming ice. The ice will be in the form of solid water, which is less dense than liquid water, causing it to float on top of the liquid water. This is why ice cubes float in a glass of water. [end of text]
