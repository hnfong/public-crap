### Conflicting Events:

1. **Music Festival (2021-04-20, 12:00–22:00)** and **Music Concert (2022-06-10, 16:00–22:00)**  
   - Both are named "Music Festival" and "Music Concert", and they overlap in time (both end at 22:00). This could be a conflict if they are meant to be distinct events.

2. **Art Exhibition (2021-06-12, 14:00–16:00)** and **Art Exhibition (2023-07-12, 14:00–16:00)**  
   - The same event name is used for two different years, and the time slots are identical. This could be a conflict if they are meant to be separate events.

3. **Science Fair (2021-08-18, 11:00–15:00)** and **Science Fair (2023-08-18, 13:00–15:00)**  
   - The same event name is used for two different years, and the time slots overlap (both end at 15:00). This could be a conflict if they are meant to be separate events.

4. **Tech Summit (2022-05-03, 11:00–14:00)** and **Tech Summit (2023-05-03, 12:00–14:00)**  
   - The same event name is used for two different years, and the time slots overlap (both end at 14:00). This could be a conflict if they are meant to be separate events.

5. **Cultural Festival (2022-10-14, 14:00–21:00)** and **Cultural Festival (2023-10-14, 14:00–21:00)**  
   - The same event name is used for two different years, and the time slots are identical. This could be a conflict if they are meant to be separate events.

### Note:
The conflicts above are based on **event names and time overlaps**, not on actual real-world scheduling. If these events are meant to be distinct, then they are conflicting. If they are meant to be the same event in different years, then they are not conflicting. [end of text]
