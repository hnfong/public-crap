Answer the following questions with brief explanations.

A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?
B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?

A) Water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. However, if there are impurities or dissolved substances in the water, it can lower the freezing point. At -12 degrees Celsius (-10.4 degrees Fahrenheit), pure water would be frozen, but if there are impurities, it might still be liquid due to the lowered freezing point.

B) If you have a glass of pure water and cool it down to -12 degrees Celsius, the water would have frozen into ice at that temperature, assuming standard atmospheric pressure. Pure water, without any impurities or dissolved gases, would have a freezing point of 0 degrees Celsius, so reaching -12 degrees Celsius would cause it to solidify into ice. [end of text]
