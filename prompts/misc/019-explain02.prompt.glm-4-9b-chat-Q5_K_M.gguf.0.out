Imagine the National People Congress is like a big family meeting in China, where all the grown-ups come together to make important decisions about the country. Just like in your family, where you might have rules about what you can do and what you can't, the National People Congress makes rules for China. They talk about things like how to build new schools, roads, and hospitals, and they decide what China should do to make sure everyone is happy and safe. It's a very important meeting because it helps China grow and change in a good way. [end of text]
