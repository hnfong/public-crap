Here are the answers:

**A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?**

No. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit).

**B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?**

The water will remain liquid.  Water can exist in a liquid state below its freezing point for a short period, a phenomenon called supercooling. However, any disturbance (like shaking the glass) could cause it to freeze rapidly.
