Yo, check it—lemme break it down in bars, no cap.  
Fed ain’t the prez, ain’t Congress, it’s the money overlord on the map.  
They print the green, stack the cream, keep the game from collapse.  
Like a DJ spinnin’ the economy, scratchin’ rates so the groove don’t snap.  

They call it “the Fed,” short for Federal Reserve,  
Got a chair like a throne—Powell sittin’ swerved.  
He twist knobs on interest, make borrowin’ cheap or steep,  
So when you tryna flip a brick (legit biz, I mean), the loan ain’t outta reach.  

When inflation wildin’—prices jumpin’ like a mosh pit—  
Fed hikes the rate, slow the spendin’, make the hype sit.  
But if the block too quiet, stores empty, pockets hurtin’,  
They drop that rate low, pump juice, get the spendin’ curtains.  

They the plug for banks, lendin’ bread when the vaults dry,  
Like frontin’ your homie a 20 till his streams multiply.  
Got a repo game—overnight cash for the big boys,  
So the whole system don’t crash, no broke noise.  

Quantitative ease? That’s just “money printer go brrr,”  
Buyin’ bonds, floodin’ streets with cash, liftin’ stocks like a blur.  
But if they pull back too quick, the market might dip,  
Like pullin’ the aux at the party—kills the vibe, kills the trip.  

Twelve districts deep, like a coast-to-coast crew,  
NY to KC, each branch got a view.  
They watch the data, count the jobs, track the price of your fries,  
Then pow—press conference, Jay-Pow spittin’ live.  

So when you flex with crypto or flip a NFT,  
Remember the Fed’s the ghost producer on the beat.  
They ain’t rappin’ on stage, but they run the whole track,  
Turn the tempo up or down—your wallet feels the clap.  

Keep it 100: Fed’s the puppeteer of the cheddar,  
Ain’t in your mentions, but they move your bag whether rain or better.  
So next time you stack or spend a stack, tip your fitted:  
The Fed’s the silent hype-man, makin’ sure the bag stay fitted. [end of text]
