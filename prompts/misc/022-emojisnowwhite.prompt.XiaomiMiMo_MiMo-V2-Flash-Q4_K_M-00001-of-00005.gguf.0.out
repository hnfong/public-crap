<think>First, the user requires that I write exclusively in emoji. I cannot break this rule, so every part of my response must be in emoji form. No text is allowed.

The story must be about Snow White, and the protagonist should resemble the classical Snow White tales, but I can be creative. So, I need to convey the story of Snow White using only emojis.

Key elements from the classical Snow White story include:

- Snow White as the protagonist

- The evil queen who is jealous of Snow White's beauty

- The mirror on the wall

- Snow White fleeing into the forest

- Meeting the seven dwarfs

- The poisoned apple

- The prince who awakens her with a kiss

- Happily ever after

I need to represent these elements using emojis. Since I can only use emojis, I should choose emojis that are commonly understood and can tell a story without text.

Let me brainstorm the sequence of events:

1. Introduce Snow White: perhaps using a princess emoji or a girl with fair skin.

2. The evil queen: a queen emoji or an older woman with a crown.

3. The mirror: a mirror emoji.

4. Snow White fleeing into the forest: a forest emoji or trees, and a running girl.

5. Meeting the seven dwarfs: dwarf emojis or small men, but since there are seven, I might use multiple dwarf emojis or a group.

6. The poisoned apple: an apple emoji with a poison symbol or a skull.

7. The prince: a prince emoji or a knight.

8. The kiss: a kiss emoji or lips.

9. Happily ever after: a heart or a castle with a happy face.

I should write the story in a sequence, using emojis to represent each part. Since it's a story, I might need to use multiple emojis in a row to depict scenes.

I cannot use any text, so I must rely on the emojis to tell the story. I should use common emojis that are easily recognizable.

Let me try to outline the story in emoji form:

- Start with Snow White: 👧 (girl) or 🏰 (castle) to show she's in a castle, but since she's a princess, I might use 👸 (princess). But classical Snow White is often depicted as a girl, so 👧 might be better. To show her beauty, I could use 💖 (heart) or ✨ (sparkles).

- The evil queen: 👸 (queen) but to distinguish from Snow White, I might use 👸 with a dark expression or 🦹 (villain) but 🦹 is a supervillain, which might not fit. Alternatively, 👵 (old woman) with a crown 👑.

- The mirror: 🪞 (mirror) and I need to show the queen asking about beauty. I might use 🪞 with 💅 (nails) or something to indicate vanity, but since I can only use emojis, I need to think how to represent the dialogue. Perhaps I can use emojis to show the queen looking in the mirror and then reacting.

- Snow White fleeing: 🌳 (tree) or 🌲 (forest) and 👧 running: 🏃‍♀️ (girl running).

- Meeting the dwarfs: 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 (family) but that might not be accurate. There are seven dwarfs, so I could use 👨‍👨‍👧‍👦 (family with two men and a girl) but that's not seven. Alternatively, I might use multiple 👨 (man) emojis, but to show they are dwarfs, I could use 👨‍🦳 (man with white hair) or something, but there's no dwarf emoji. I might use 🧚 (fairy) but that's not dwarfs. Perhaps I can use 👨 (man) with a small size, but emojis don't have size variation. I might use 🧍 (person) but again, no dwarf. I think I have to use common men emojis and imply they are dwarfs by context. Or use 🏃‍♂️ (running man) to show they are in the forest, but that might not be clear. Let me think: in emoji stories, people often use group emojis or multiple emojis to represent characters.

- The poisoned apple: 🍎 (apple) and ☠️ (poison) or 💀 (skull).

- The prince: 🤴 (prince) or 🦸 (superhero) but 🦸 might not fit. 🤴 is better.

- The kiss: 💋 (kiss) or 😘 (kissing face).

- Happily ever after: 💍 (ring) for marriage or 🏰 (castle) with ❤️ (heart).

I need to write the story in a way that flows without text. I might use arrows or other symbols to indicate sequence, but since I can only use emojis, I should use the emojis in order to tell the story.

Let me try to write a sequence:

1. 👧 (Snow White)

2. 👸 (Evil queen) - but to show she is evil, I might use 😈 (devil) or 🦹 (villain), but 🦹 is a supervillain, which might not be classical. I'll use 👸 with a dark expression, but emojis don't have expressions, so I might use 👸 followed by 😠 (angry face) or something.

3. 🪞 (Mirror) - I need to show the queen asking about beauty. I might use 🪞 with 💅 (nails) to indicate vanity, but 💅 is for manicure. Alternatively, I can use 🪞 and then 👩 (woman) and then 🏆 (trophy) to show she wants to be the most beautiful, but that might not be clear.

4. 👧 (Snow White) and 🌳 (forest) and 🏃‍♀️ (running girl) to show she flees.

5. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 (family) but that might not be dwarfs. I might use 👨 (man) repeated seven times: 👨 👨 👨 👨 👨 👨 👨 but that might be too many. Or use 🧍‍♂️ (man) and then 🏠 (house) to show they live in a house.

6. 🍎 (apple) and ☠️ (poison) or 💀 (skull) to show the poisoned apple.

7. 😘 (kiss) or 💋 (kiss) to show the prince kissing her.

8. 🏰 (castle) and ❤️ (heart) for happily ever after.

But this might not be coherent. I need to make sure the story is understandable.

I can use emojis to represent actions, like 🚪 (door) for entering, 🌳 (tree) for forest, etc.

Let me write a story in emoji form:

First, introduce Snow White: 👧✨ (girl with sparkles to show beauty)

Then, the evil queen: 👸😠 (queen with angry face)

Then, the mirror: 🪞 (mirror) and perhaps 👩 (woman) to show the queen looking at herself, but I need to show she is asking about beauty. I might use 🪞 and then 🏆 (trophy) to show she wants to be the best.

Then, Snow White: 👧 and then 🌳 (forest) and 🏃‍♀️ (running) to show she runs into the forest.

Then, meeting the dwarfs: 🏠 (house) and 👨‍👨‍👧‍👦 (family with two men and a girl) but that's not seven. I might use 🧍‍♂️ (man) and then 🧍‍♂️ (man) multiple times, but to save space, I might use 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 (family with one man, one woman, one girl, one boy) but that's not dwarfs. Perhaps I can use 👨 (man) with a small size, but emojis don't have size. I think I have to use multiple 👨 (man) emojis and imply they are dwarfs by context. Or use 🧚 (fairy) but that's not right. Another idea: use 👨 (man) and then 🏃‍♂️ (running man) to show they are in the forest, but that might not be clear. I might use 🌳 (tree) and then 👨 (man) repeated seven times, but that might be long. I can use 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 (family) and then add a number, but I can't use numbers. I might use 🧍 (person) and then 🧍 (person) multiple times, but to show they are dwarfs, I might use 🧍 (person) with a hat or something, but there's no dwarf emoji. I think I have to accept that using multiple 👨 (man) emojis might be the best way, and the user will understand from the story that they are the seven dwarfs.

Then, the poisoned apple: 🍎 (apple) and ☠️ (poison) or 💀 (kull) and then 👧 (girl) with 😵 (dizzy face) or 🛌 (bed) to show she is asleep.

Then, the prince: 🤴 (prince) and then 😘 (kiss) and then 👧 (girl) with 😊 (happy face) or ❤️ (heart).

Then, 🏰 (castle) and 💍 (ring) or 🎉 (party) for happily ever after.

Now, to write the story, I need to sequence these emojis in a way that tells the story. I might use arrows or other symbols, but since I can only use emojis, I should use the emojis in order without breaking the rule.

Let me try to write a sequence:

👧✨ 👸😠 🪞🏆 🌳🏃‍♀️ 🏠👨👨👨👨👨👨👨 (but that's seven men, which might be too many) I might use 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 but that's not seven. Alternatively, I can use 🧍‍♂️ (man) and then 🧍‍♂️ (man) but to show seven, I might use 🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️ but that's seven man emojis, but they are all the same, so it might work.

Then, 🍎☠️ 👧😵 🤴😘 👧❤️ 🏰💍

But this might not be clear. I need to make sure the sequence is logical.

I can use emojis to show the action, like 🚪 (door) for entering the house, or 🌳 (tree) for forest, etc.

Another idea: use 🏳️ (white flag) for Snow White? No, that's not right. There is no specific emoji for Snow White, so I have to use 👧 (girl) or 👸 (princess) but 👸 might be confused with the queen. I might use 👧 for Snow White and 👸 for the queen, and to show Snow White's beauty, I can use 💖 (heart) or ✨ (sparkles) after 👧.

Let me write a story in emoji:

1. 👧 (Snow White)

2. 👸 (Evil queen)

3. 🪞 (Mirror)

4. 👧 (Snow White) - but to show the queen is jealous, I might use 👸 😠 (angry) and then 🪞 (mirror) and then 👧 (girl) with 💖 (heart) to show the mirror says Snow White is more beautiful.

5. 👧 🌳 🏃‍♀️ (Snow White runs into the forest)

6. 🏠 👨 👨 👨 👨 👨 👨 👨 (seven men in a house) but to show they are dwarfs, I might use 🧍‍♂️ (man) but 🧍‍♂️ is a full-size man, so it might not be dwarf. I think I have to use 👨 (man) and rely on context.

7. 👧 ❤️ (Snow White loves them or they are happy)

8. 🍎 (apple) and ☠️ (poison) or 💀 (skull) and then 👧 (girl) with 😵 (dizzy face) or 🛌 (bed) to show she eats the apple and falls asleep.

9. 🤴 (prince) and 😘 (kiss) and then 👧 (girl) with 😊 (happy face) or ❤️ (heart)

10. 🏰 (castle) and 💍 (ring) or 🎉 (party) for happily ever after.

To save space, I might use fewer emojis but make sure the story is told.

I can use 🔄 (repeat) or 🔁 (repeat) but that might not be allowed or might break the rule. I think I should avoid symbols that are not emojis, but 🔄 and 🔁 are emojis, so they might be used.

But let's stick to common emojis.

Another thought: I can use 👧 (girl) for Snow White, and 👸 (queen) for the evil queen, and for the dwarfs, I can use 👨 (man) with a number, but I can't use numbers. I might use 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 (family) and then add a small emoji to show they are small, but there is no small emoji. I think I have to accept that using multiple 👨 (man) emojis is the best way.

Let me try to write the story:

👧✨ 👸😠 🪞🏆 🌳🏃‍♀️ 🏠👨👨👨👨👨👨👨 🍎☠️ 👧😵 🤴😘 👧❤️ 🏰💍

But this is long, and the user might not understand that the seven men are the dwarfs. I might use 🧍‍♂️ (man) but 🧍‍♂️ is a neutral man, and it might not be dwarf. I might use 👨 (man) with a beard, but there is no dwarf-specific emoji. I think I have to use 👨 (man) and hope the user understands from the story.

To make it clearer, I can use 🌳 (tree) before the men to show they are in the forest, and then 🏠 (house) to show they live in a house.

So, for the dwarfs: 🌳 🏠 👨 👨 👨 👨 👨 👨 👨 but that's eight emojis, which might be too many. I can use 🏠 👨‍👨‍👧‍👦 but that's not seven. I might use 🏠 and then 🧍‍♂️ 🧍‍♂️ 🧍‍♂️ 🧍‍♂️ 🧍‍♂️ 🧍‍♂️ 🧍‍♂️ but that's seven man emojis, but they are all the same, so it might work.

I think I'll go with that.

Now, for the poisoned apple: I can use 🍎 (apple) and then 💀 (skull) to show it's poisoned, and then 👧 (girl) and then 🛌 (bed) to show she is asleep.

For the kiss: 🤴 (prince) and then 😘 (kiss) and then 👧 (girl) and then ❤️ (heart) to show she wakes up with love.

For the happy ending: 🏰 (castle) and 💍 (ring) and 🎉 (party) or 😊 (happy face).

Let me write the full story:

👧✨ 👸😠 🪞🏆 🌳🏃‍♀️ 🏠🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️ 🍎💀 👧🛌 🤴😘 👧❤️ 🏰💍🎉

But I used 🧍‍♂️ (man) which is a neutral man, and it might not be dwarf. I might use 👨 (man) instead, but 👨 is a man with beard, which might be better for dwarfs. So, I'll use 👨 for dwarfs.

Also, for the queen, I used 🪞🏆 to show the mirror says she is the best, but I need to show that the mirror says Snow White is more beautiful. I might use 🪞 and then 👧 and then 🏆 to show the mirror says the girl is the best, but that might not be clear. I can use 🪞 and then 👸 and then 😠 and then 👧 and then 💖 to show the queen is angry because the girl has heart.

Let me try to improve the sequence:

1. 👧 (Snow White)

2. 👸 (Evil queen)

3. 🪞 (Mirror)

4. 👸 😠 (Queen angry)

5. 👧 💖 (Snow White with heart) to show she is more beautiful

6. 🌳 (Forest) and 🏃‍♀️ (Running girl) to show she runs away

7. 🏠 (House) and 👨 👨 👨 👨 👨 👨 👨 (seven men) to show she meets the dwarfs

8. 🍎 (Apple) and 💀 (Skull) to show the poisoned apple

9. 👧 (Girl) and 🛌 (Bed) to show she is asleep

10. 🤴 (Prince) and 😘 (Kiss) to show he kisses her

11. 👧 (Girl) and ❤️ (Heart) to show she wakes up with love

12. 🏰 (Castle) and 💍 (Ring) and 🎉 (Party) to show happy ending

I can use 😊 (Happy face) for the girl after she wakes up.

Now, to write it in a single line or multiple lines? Since I can only use emojis, I should write it as a sequence of emojis without text. I might use spaces or no spaces, but in emoji writing, people often use spaces to separate emojis for readability.

The user said "write a story", so I should use multiple emojis in a sequence.

Let me write the story:

👧✨ 👸😠 🪞🏆 👧💖 🌳🏃‍♀️ 🏠👨👨👨👨👨👨👨 🍎💀 👧🛌 🤴😘 👧❤️ 🏰💍🎉

But this is long, and I used eight 👨 for dwarfs, but there are seven dwarfs, so I should use seven 👨. Let me count: 👨👨👨👨👨👨👨 is seven men. Yes.

I used 🪞🏆 to show the mirror says she is the best, but I need to show that the mirror says the queen is not the most beautiful. I might use 🪞 and then 👸 and then 😠 and then 👧 and then 🏆, but that might be too many emojis. I think 🪞🏆 might be interpreted as the mirror trophy, but in context, it might work.

Another idea: use 🪞 and then 👩 and then 🏆, but 👩 is woman, which might be the queen or Snow White. I think I'll stick with 👸 for queen and 👧 for Snow White.

To show the mirror's response, I can use 🪞 and then 👧 and then 🏆, meaning the mirror says the girl is the best.

So, let me try: 👸
