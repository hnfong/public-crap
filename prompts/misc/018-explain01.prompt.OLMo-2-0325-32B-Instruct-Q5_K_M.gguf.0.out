Yo, listen up, I'm about to break it down for ya,
The Federal Reserve, they're like the money's DJ,
They spin the economy, keepin' it in check,
Adjustin' the flow, they don't mess with the wreck.

They're the big boss, call 'em the Fed,
They ain't rappers, but they got the whole nation fed,
They control the dough, the green, the cash,
Keepin' the economy tight, not too fast, not too rash.

They got tools, like interest rates, they tweak,
To keep inflation chill, not too high, not too weak,
They print the money, but they don't flood the streets,
They make sure the cash flow is on beat.

When the economy's slippin', they got the back,
Lower rates, stimulate, bring the economy back,
When it's too hot, they cool it down,
Raise rates, slow the spending, keep the economy sound.

They're like the ref in the game, keepin' it fair,
Watching the banks, making sure they play square,
They got the power, they ain't no joke,
The Federal Reserve, they run the monetary yoke.

So next time you're spittin' about the dough,
Remember the Fed, they're the ones in control,
They keep the economy tight, like a dope beat,
The Federal Reserve, they're the money's elite. [end of text]
