Bob is **partially right**, but **Alice is correct in the context of the question**.

**Explanation:**

- Water **freezes at 0°C under standard atmospheric pressure**. So Alice is correct in saying that water freezes at 0°C.
- Bob says "water freezes at -10°C" — this is **incorrect** under normal conditions. At -10°C, water does **not** freeze; instead, it remains liquid (or may begin to freeze only under specific conditions like supercooling, which is rare and not typical).
- However, Bob says, "Yes, but I'm still right," which implies he believes water freezes at -10°C — which is **not true** under standard conditions.

So, **Alice is right** — water freezes at 0°C, not at -10°C.  
Bob is **wrong** in stating that water freezes at -10°C, even if he claims to be "still right" — that claim is incorrect.

✅ **Final answer: Alice is right.** [end of text]
