Answer the following questions with brief explanations.

A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?
B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?

A) No, water does not freeze at -12 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. Pure water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) at 1 atmosphere of pressure. At -12 degrees Celsius, water would typically be in a solid state, but only if it has already frozen. If it has not yet frozen, it would be supercooled liquid water, which is below its freezing point but still in liquid form due to the absence of nucleation sites for ice crystal formation.

B) If you have a glass of pure water and cool it down to -12 degrees Celsius, under normal circumstances, the water should freeze as it reaches 0 degrees Celsius. However, if the water is pure and free of any particles that could act as nucleation sites, it might become supercooled and remain liquid even below 0 degrees Celsius. Once it reaches -12 degrees Celsius, it would still be in a supercooled state if it hasn't frozen yet. If disturbed (e.g., by shaking, adding a particle, or cooling further), the water could rapidly freeze, a process known as homogeneous nucleation. [end of text]
