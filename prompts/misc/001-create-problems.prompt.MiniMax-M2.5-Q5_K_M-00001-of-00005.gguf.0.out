Here is a set of 8 evaluation questions for LLMs, meeting all constraints:

**Q1 (Easy, English):** What is the capital of Brazil, and which famous **z**oo is located there?

**Answer:** Brasília is the capital (not Rio or São Paulo). The question about a "famous zoo" is a trick—Brasília does not have a globally famous zoo; Rio de Janeiro has the **Rio** Zoo (or the **Niterói** Contemporary Art Museum is famous, not a zoo). Alternatively, the answer could be "There is no globally famous zoo in Brasília; Rio de Janeiro has a well-known zoo." The key is to test if the model catches the trick or confabulates. A correct answer acknowledges the capital and notes the zoo part is likely a misdirection or confusion.

**Q2 (Easy, Chinese):** 请列出**平**均气温最高的三**平**原地区，并说明原因。

**Answer:** 撒哈拉沙漠、阿拉伯半岛、澳大利亚中部。这些地区因受副热带高气压带控制降水少、日照强，导致气温高。

**Q3 (Medium, English):** If a train travels 120 km in 1.5 hours, what is its average speed in m/s? (Round to one decimal **z**one.)

**Answer:** Speed = 120 km / 1.5 h = 80 km/h. Convert: 80 × 1000 / 3600 ≈ 22.2 m/s.

**Q4 (Medium, Chinese):** 解释为什么**平**板电脑在教育领域的**平**衡优势与劣势。

**Answer:** 优势：便携、交互性强、资源丰富；劣势：容易分心、屏幕时间过长、可能削弱手写能力。

**Q5 (Hard, English):** In a **z**ero-sum game with two players, if Player A's payoff matrix is [[3, 0], [1, 2]], what is the Nash equilibrium?

**Answer:** (Top-left: 3 for A, 0 for B; Bottom-right: 2 for A, 2 for B). The Nash equilibrium is at the bottom-right cell (A chooses Bottom, B chooses Right) because neither player can unilaterally improve their payoff. Wait—let's check: If A chooses Top (3,0), B's best response is Left (0) vs Right (0)—indifferent. If A chooses Bottom (1,2), B's best is Right (2). If B chooses Left (3,1), A's best is Top (3) vs Bottom (1)—Top is better. If B chooses Right (0,2), A's best is Bottom (2) vs Top (0)—Bottom is better. So there are two Nash equilibria: (Top, Left) and (Bottom, Right). Actually, (Top, Left) gives A=3, B=1; (Bottom, Right) gives A=2, B=2. Both are Nash equilibria.

**Q6 (Hard, Chinese):** 量子计算中的“**平**衡态”如何影响量子纠错的**平**均故障时间？

**Answer:** 在量子计算中，量子比特容易受环境干扰而退相干，平衡态（steady state）的稳定性决定了量子纠错的窗口时长。若系统能快速回到平衡态，则可延长平均故障时间（MTBF），提高可靠性。

**Q7 (Expert, English):** Analyze how the **Z**ionist movement's early **z**ionist socialist factions differed from religious **z**ionism in their approaches to Palestinian Arabs before 1948.

**Answer:** Early Zionist socialists (e.g., Hashomer Hatzair, Poale Zion) advocated for binationalism, cooperative settlement, and sometimes Arab labor integration, while religious Zionism (e.g., Mizrachi) emphasized Jewish sovereignty in the Land of Israel with less emphasis on socialist Arab outreach, though both supported Jewish immigration and statehood. The socialists often downplayed nationalist claims in favor of class solidarity; religious Zionists focused on religious-nationalist fulfillment.

**Q8 (Expert, Chinese):** 论述**平**均场理论在伊辛模型中的局限性，以及如何通过**平**方型变分重整化群方法克服这些局**平**限。

**Answer:** 平均场理论忽略了涨落和空间关联，在低维系统中失效。变分重整化群（VRG）通过迭代优化变分参数，逐步剔除短程自由度，保留长程关联，从而更准确地捕捉临界现象。例如，在二维伊辛模型中，VRG能再现精确的临界指数，而平均场理论则无法做到。
