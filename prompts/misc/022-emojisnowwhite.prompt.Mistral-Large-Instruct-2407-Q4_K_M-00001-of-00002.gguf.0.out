 👑👸 Once upon a time, there was a princess named Snow White. 🌨️⚪️ She was known for her beauty, kindness, and her skin as white as snow. 🌹 Her stepmother, the evil queen, was jealous of her beauty. 👑👸💚💔

One day, the queen asked her magic mirror who the fairest of them all was. 🪞 The mirror replied, "Snow White is the fairest of them all." 🌹👸 The queen became furious and ordered a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. 🌳🔪

The huntsman couldn't bring himself to harm Snow White, so he let her go. 🌳👸 Snow White wandered through the forest and found a small cottage where seven dwarfs lived. 🏠🧑‍🦲🧑‍🦲🧑‍🦲🧑‍🦲🧑‍🦲🧑‍🦲🧑‍🦲
