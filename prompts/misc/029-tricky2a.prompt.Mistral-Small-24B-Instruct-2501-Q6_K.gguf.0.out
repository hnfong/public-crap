 Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.
  Both Alice and Bob are partially correct, but they are talking about different aspects of water's behavior at low temperatures.

- **Alice** is correct in stating that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure. This is the freezing point of water.

- **Bob** is also correct in a broader sense. At -10 degrees Celsius, water that is already in a liquid state will freeze. However, if the water is already frozen (i.e., it has turned into ice), it will remain frozen at -10 degrees Celsius. Additionally, water can exist in a supercooled state below 0 degrees Celsius without freezing, but this is a metastable state and not the typical behavior.

So, both statements are valid depending on the context. [end of text]
