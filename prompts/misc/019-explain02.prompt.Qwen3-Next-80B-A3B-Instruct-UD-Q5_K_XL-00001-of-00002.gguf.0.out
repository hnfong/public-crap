Okay! Imagine you have a big group of grown-ups who help make the rules for a really big house — China. This big house has lots of rooms, lots of people, and they need rules to make sure everyone is safe and happy.

The National People’s Congress is like a super-big meeting of very important grown-ups. They’re like the team that decides the big rules for China — like how schools work, what toys are safe, or how to keep the air clean.

It’s like when you and your friends decide together what game to play at school — but this is for a whole country, and the people who decide are chosen by others to help make fair rules for everyone.

So, it’s like a super-duper big team meeting — but for all of China! 🇨🇳✨ [end of text]
