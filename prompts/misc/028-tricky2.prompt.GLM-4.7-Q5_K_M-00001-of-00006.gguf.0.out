**Bob is right.**

Here is why:

*   **Alice** is referring to the **freezing point** of pure water at standard atmospheric pressure, which is indeed 0°C.
*   **Bob** is referring to the **state** of water at that specific temperature. Once water is cooled to -10°C, it is frozen (solid ice). Therefore, it is factually correct to say that water is frozen at -10°C.

Bob is describing the condition of the water at that temperature, while Alice is describing the temperature required to initiate the phase change. [end of text]
