Bob is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, but once it's frozen, it can remain ice even if the temperature drops further. So at -10 degrees, the water would be solid ice. Bob's statement "It freezes" might be referring to the state of water being frozen, not the exact freezing point. Alice is pointing out the freezing point, but Bob's answer is still valid in context.
