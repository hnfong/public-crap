If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

A delightful question delving into the foundations of logic and the nature of self-referential statements within formal systems!

**Consistent vs. Tautological:**

- **Consistent:** A theory (or a set of axioms) is considered **consistent** if there is no statement such that both the statement and its negation can be derived from the axioms of the theory using its rules of inference. In other words, a consistent theory does not contain contradictions. Consistency does not necessarily imply that the theory proves itself but rather that it does not self-destruct through contradictions.

- **Tautological:** A **tautology** is a statement that is always true by virtue of its logical form alone, requiring no knowledge of the external world to determine its truth value. In the context of a theory proving itself, if the act of the theory proving its own validity is based on a logical form that makes the statement of self-validation inherently true (regardless of the theory's content), one might lean towards describing the self-proof as tautological. However, in strict logical terms, tautology usually refers to specific types of propositions, not the meta-property of a theory proving its own consistency or validity.

**Self-Proving Theories: Examples and Interpretations**

1. ** Gödel's Second Incompleteness Theorem**: This theorem states that if a sufficiently powerful formal system is consistent, it cannot prove its own consistency. However, if such a system is inconsistent, it can indeed prove its own consistency (trivially, since it can prove anything). The interesting case here isn't exactly an example of a theory being both consistent and proving itself but highlights the relationship between consistency and self-proof.

2. **Löb's Theorem**: This theorem, derived from Gödel's incompleteness theorems, states that if a formal system can prove that a certain statement implies its own provability, then the system can in fact prove that statement. While not exactly about a theory proving its own consistency or validity directly, it shows how self-referential proofs can lead to interesting consequences.

3. **Trivial Theories**: Consider a "theory" with a single axiom: "This theory is true." Or, more formally, in a propositional logic framework, the axiom could be "T", with "T" defined as "This theory is consistent (or true)". This would indeed "prove" itself but is more of a tautological exercise than a substantial theory, as it doesn't provide any meaningful structure or insights beyond its self-referential claim.

4. **Paraconsistent Logics**: These are logics that allow for contradictions to be true without leading to triviality (the ability to prove any statement). Some paraconsistent theories might be designed in such a way that they can "prove" their own consistency in a non-trivial manner, but this would depend on the specific framework and how "consistency" is defined within it.

**Conclusion**:

- If a theory proves its own consistency or validity in a non-trivial, meaningful way (which is rare and usually subject to the constraints of Gödel's incompleteness theorems for sufficiently powerful systems), it might be more accurate to discuss this in terms of **consistency** and the implications of self-proof within the context of that theory's logical framework.
  
- If the self-proof is more about the logical form guaranteeing the truth of the self-referential statement regardless of the theory's content, then **tautological** might be a fitting descriptor, though this is less common in discussions of entire theories proving themselves.

**Examples** of non-trivial, meaningful theories that prove themselves in a way that sparks interesting discussion are scarce due to the constraints imposed by Gödel's incompleteness theorems. Most illustrations will either be trivial (like the single axiom "This theory is true") or will involve nuanced discussions around the edges of what "proving oneself" means in formal systems.
