The Linux command you've provided is a series of pipes that process the contents of the file `wowfanfic.txt` in a specific way. Let's break down the command step by step and then predict the output based on the operations performed:

1. `cat wowfanfic.txt`: This command outputs the contents of the file `wowfanfic.txt` to the terminal.

2. `|`: This is a pipe that takes the output of the previous command and passes it as input to the next command.

3. `perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'`: This Perl command reads the input line by line (`-n`), splits each line into an array `@a` using whitespace as the delimiter (`split(/\s/)`), and then prints each element of the array on a new line.

4. `| sort`: This command sorts the lines of text in alphabetical order.

5. `| uniq -c`: This command counts the number of occurrences of each unique line from the sorted input.

6. `| sort -n`: This command sorts the output numerically (by the count numbers).

7. `| tail -n 20`: This command takes the last 20 lines of the sorted, counted output.

Given this sequence of operations, the probable output will be a list of the 20 most frequently occurring words (or tokens) from the text in `wowfanfic.txt`, along with their respective counts. Here's what the output might look like:

```
20: the
15: and
12: to
10: of
8: a
7: in
6: he
5: it
4: for
3: on
2: with
1: as
1: by
1: that
1: but
1: his
1: her
1: them
1: was
```

Explanation based on basic linguistic principles:

- **Tokenization**: The `split(/\s/)` operation tokenizes the text by splitting it into words based on whitespace. This is a common way to break down text into its basic units of meaning.

- **Sorting**: The `sort` command arranges the tokens in alphabetical order, which is a standard step in many text processing tasks.

- **Uniqueness and Counting**: The `uniq -c` command identifies unique tokens and counts their occurrences, which is useful for identifying the most common words in a text.

- **Numerical Sorting**: The `sort -n` command then sorts the counts numerically, which is necessary to determine the most frequent words.

- **Tail**: Finally, `tail -n 20` extracts the last 20 lines, which correspond to the 20 most frequent words in the text.

Please note that the actual output may vary depending on the content of `wowfanfic.txt` and the specific words used within the text. [end of text]
