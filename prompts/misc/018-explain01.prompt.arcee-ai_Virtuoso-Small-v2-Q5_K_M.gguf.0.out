Yo, listen up, I'm about to drop some knowledge on the Fed,  
It's like the DJ of the economy, keepin' it steady,  
Not just a bank, but the boss of all banks,  
Regulatin' the flow, like a master of plans.

They set the interest rates, like the tempo of a beat,  
When it's high, loans are tight, when it's low, it's a street,  
They print money, but they don't just do it for fun,  
They control inflation, keepin' the economy runnin'.

When the economy's slow, they drop some stimulus,  
Like a hot track, it gets the streets buzzing,  
They buy bonds, inject cash, get the flow goin',  
When it's too hot, they cool it down, like a DJ's knowin'.

They check the banks, make sure they're not shady,  
Like a security guard, keepin' the streets safe and steady,  
They set rules, make sure the game's fair,  
Like referees, they keep the economy in the air.

So next time you hear about the Fed,  
Remember they're the ones keepin' the economy fed,  
Like a DJ, they keep the beat,  
And that's the role of the Federal Reserve, straight up, no cheat. [end of text]
