Here are the answers with brief explanations:

**A) Yes.**
At standard atmospheric pressure, the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius. Therefore, at -12 degrees Celsius, water is well below its freezing point and will turn into ice.

**B) It freezes into solid ice.**
Because the water is pure and has reached a temperature (-12°C) significantly lower than its freezing point (0°C), it will undergo a phase change from liquid to solid. [end of text]
