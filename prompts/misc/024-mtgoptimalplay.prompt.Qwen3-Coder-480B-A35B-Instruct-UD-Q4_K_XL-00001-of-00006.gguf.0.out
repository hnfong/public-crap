Let me analyze this step by step.

**Current State:**
- Alice: 2 Kindle cards in hand
- Bob: Orim, Samite Healer (1/3) in play, untapped
- Bob's lands are tapped out (can't cast spells this turn)

**Kindle Analysis:**
- "Kindle deals X damage to any target, where X is 2 plus the number of cards named Kindle in all graveyards"
- When cast, the first Kindle goes to graveyard, so X = 2 + 1 = 3 damage
- Second Kindle can deal 2 + 2 = 4 damage (if first is already in graveyard)

**Alice's Optimal Play:**

Alice should cast both Kindles targeting Orim:

1. **First Kindle**: Deals 3 damage to Orim (2 + 1 from itself in graveyard)
2. **Second Kindle**: Deals 4 damage to Orim (2 + 2 from both Kindles in graveyard)

Total damage: 7 damage to Orim (1/3), which is lethal.

**Bob's Response Options:**

Since Bob's lands are tapped out, he cannot cast any spells. His only available action is Orim's ability:

**Tap Orim to prevent the next 3 damage** that would be dealt to any target this turn.

**Bob's Optimal Play:**

Bob should tap Orim to prevent 3 damage from the first Kindle. This reduces the damage sequence to:
- First Kindle: 3 damage prevented → Orim takes 0 damage
- Second Kindle: 4 damage → Orim dies (0 + 4 = 4 damage vs 3 toughness)

**Outcome:**

Even with Bob's optimal play, Orim dies. The best Bob can do is reduce the damage from 7 to 4, but that's still lethal to the 1/3 creature.

**Thought Process:**

- **Alice's reasoning**: Cast both burn spells for maximum damage. Since Bob can only prevent 3 damage maximum, 7 damage guarantees the kill.
- **Bob's reasoning**: Use Orim's ability to prevent the maximum possible damage (3) from the first spell, but this still isn't enough to save Orim.

**Key MTG Mechanics Applied:**
- Stack resolution: Spells resolve one at a time
- Damage prevention: Orim's ability prevents up to 3 damage to any target
- Graveyard state: Cards in graveyard count for Kindle's damage calculation
- Mana restrictions: Tapped lands cannot produce mana until untapped

**Final Result**: Alice kills Orim regardless of Bob's response. Bob's optimal play minimizes the loss but cannot prevent it. [end of text]
