A) Yes, water freezes at -12°C — but only if it’s pure and undisturbed. Pure water freezes at 0°C under standard pressure. At -12°C, it will freeze if it’s not supercooled (i.e., not kept liquid below 0°C without nucleation).

B) If you cool pure water in a glass to -12°C, it will likely freeze — unless it’s supercooled. Supercooling can occur if there are no impurities or nucleation sites, but even then, freezing usually happens soon after reaching -12°C. The glass may crack if the water freezes and expands.

Note: Pure water can be supercooled to around -40°C under ideal conditions, but -12°C is well below that, so freezing is very likely. [end of text]
