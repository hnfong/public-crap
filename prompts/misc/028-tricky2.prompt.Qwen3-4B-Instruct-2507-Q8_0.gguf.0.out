Bob is **not** right in saying "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius," and Alice is correct: **water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure.**

So, **Alice is right**.

**Explanation:**  
At standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), water changes from liquid to solid (freezes) at **0°C**. At -10°C, water would be **frozen**, but that doesn't mean it *freezes at* -10°C — it means it's already in the solid state. The freezing point is defined as the temperature at which liquid water turns into ice, which is **0°C**, not -10°C.

Bob's statement is factually incorrect. Saying "water freezes at -10°C" is wrong. Even though water *can* be frozen at -10°C, it doesn't *freeze at* that temperature — it freezes at 0°C.

✅ Correct answer: **Alice is right.** [end of text]
