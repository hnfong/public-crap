Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is technically right. While it's true water *typically* freezes at 0°C, water can freeze at temperatures below 0°C under certain conditions (like with impurities present). Alice is focusing on the standard freezing point, but Bob's statement isn't inherently false.
