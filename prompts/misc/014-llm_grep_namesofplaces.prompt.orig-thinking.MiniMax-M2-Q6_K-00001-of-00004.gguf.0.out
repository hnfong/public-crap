The user wants a semantic grep: for each line in the input, output the line or requested contents of the line (together with line number) only if the line has something that matches the given query/description, otherwise ignore the line. The query is "names of countries or regions. only output the country/region names with line number, something like grep -n -o". So we need to output each country/region name found in each line, with line number, like grep -n -o. So we need to parse each line, find country/region names, and output them with line number. The user says "only output the country/region names with line number, something like grep -n -o". So we need to output each match on its own line, with line number prefix, like "1: Britain". But we need to decide format: typical grep -n -o prints "line_number:match". So we should output "1: Britain". But we need to separate each output line with "---". The user says "after each line of output, also emit a "---" to separate it from your next output." So after each output line, we need to output "---". So final output will be lines like "1: Britain" then "---" then "2: ..." etc.

We need to identify country/region names in the input. The input includes many references: "Britain", "UK", "France", "Portugal", "Germany", "England", "Holland", "Hamburg", "Dantzic", "Riga", "France", "England", "France", "England".
