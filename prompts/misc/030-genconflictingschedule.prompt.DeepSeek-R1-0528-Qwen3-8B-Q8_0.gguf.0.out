We are going to generate 30 events with random dates and times in the 2020s.
 We'll use the datetime module to generate random dates and times.
 Since we want to avoid sorted dates, we'll generate a random set of dates and times.
 We'll also try to introduce some conflicts (overlapping events) by design.

 Steps:
 1. Import necessary modules: datetime, random, and csv.
 2. Define a function to generate a random date in the 2020s (from 2020-01-01 to 2029-12-31).
 3. Define a function to generate a random time (from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59).
 4. Create a list of 30 events with randomly generated dates and times.
 5. Write the events to a CSV file (or just print them if we are not saving to a file).
 6. Then, we'll check for conflicts (events that overlap in time) and report which events conflict and why.

 However, note: the problem says "Do not have the dates sorted", so we'll generate the events without sorting.

 But note: the problem also says "Try to make some of them conflict", so we'll intentionally create some overlapping events.

 Let's plan to have 5 events that conflict with each other in a way that we can identify.

 We'll generate events and then check for conflicts by comparing the time intervals.

 We'll define a conflict as two events that have overlapping time (same day or different days, but note: if one event ends at 10:00 and another starts at 10:00, they don't conflict by the typical definition, but we can consider that as adjacent and not overlapping. However, the problem doesn't specify, so let's assume that if one event ends at the same time another starts, they don't conflict. We'll check for strict overlap: event A is from startA to endA, event B from startB to endB. They conflict if (startA < endB and startB < endA).

 But note: the problem says "some of them conflict", so we'll design a few events to overlap.

 We'll generate 30 events, and then we'll check for conflicts.

 However, the problem says "Do not have the dates sorted", so we'll generate the events randomly and then check.

 Let's generate the events and then check for conflicts.

 We'll create a list of events, each event is a tuple (Event Name, Start Date, Start Time, End Date, End Time)

 We'll use:
   Event Name: a string with a random name (we can use a list of names and pick randomly, or generate random strings)
   Start Date and End Date: random dates in the 2020s, but we can also have the same date or consecutive dates.
   Start Time and End Time: random times, but we must ensure that the start time is before the end time.

 We'll also make sure that the events are not all on the same day.

 We'll intentionally create some overlapping events by having two events that start and end at the same time, or one that starts before the other ends.

 Let's generate 30 events and then check for conflicts.

 We'll use the following approach for generating random dates and times:

   Start Date: random from 2020-01-01 to 2029-12-31
   Start Time: random from 0 to 23 hours, 0 to 59 minutes, 0 to 59 seconds.
   End Date: random from the same day or a later day (but we can also have events that span multiple days, but let's keep it simple and assume events are within a day or two? Actually, we can have events that last multiple days, but then we have to consider the time of day. Let's keep events within a single day for simplicity, unless we want to have multi-day events. The problem doesn't specify, so let's stick to single-day events to avoid complexity.)

 However, the problem says "random", so we can have events that last from a few minutes to a few days. But to keep it manageable, let's assume events are at most one day long (so end date is either the same as start date or one day after). But note: we are generating random dates, so we can have events that start on one day and end on a later day.

 But the conflict condition must consider events that span multiple days. We can do:

   Event A: from 2020-01-01 10:00 to 2020-01-02 11:00
   Event B: from 2020-01-01 10:30 to 2020-01-01 11:00

 They conflict because the second event of A is from 10:00 to 11:00 (next day) and B is from 10:30 to 11:00 (same day) on the first day? Actually, the entire event A spans two days, so we have to compare the time intervals properly.

 Let's define the conflict condition without worrying about the day:

   Two events (A and B) conflict if the intervals [startA, endA) and [startB, endB) overlap.

   We can convert the events to a common time representation (like timestamp) and then check.

   Alternatively, we can compare by:

        if (startA < endB) and (startB < endA): then they conflict.

   But note: if we have events that span multiple days, we need to consider the entire duration.

   We can represent each event as a tuple (start, end) where start and end are datetime objects.

   Then, we can check for overlap by:

        event1_start = datetime object for start
        event1_end = datetime object for end
        event2_start = datetime object for start
        event2_end = datetime object for end

        if event1_start < event2_end and event2_start < event1_end: then they overlap.

   However, note that the events are defined with start and end dates and times. We can combine them into a single datetime.

   We'll generate:

        Start Date: random from 2020-01-01 to 2029-12-31
        Start Time: random from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59

        End Date: random from the same day or a later day (but we can also have the same day or one day after, or even more? Let's say we can have events that last up to 2 days, so end date can be the same or one or two days after? Actually, we can have events that last longer, but we'll keep it within 1 or 2 days to avoid too many conflicts.)

   But the problem says "random", so we can have events that last from 1 minute to 10 days? That might be too much. Let's keep it simple: events are at most one day long (so end date is either the same as start date or one day after). And the time duration is random.

   However, we are also asked to have some conflicts. So we can design:

        Event 1: 2020-01-01 10:00 to 2020-01-01 12:00
        Event 2: 2020-01-01 11:00 to 2020-01-01 13:00

        Then Event 1 and Event 2 conflict.

   We can also have events that are on different days but the end time of one is after the start time of the other (if the other starts on the next day, then we have to consider the time of day). But note: if an event ends at 2020-01-01 23:59 and another starts at 2020-01-02 00:00, they don't conflict. But if one ends at 2020-01-01 10:00 and the other starts at 2020-01-02 09:00, they don't conflict. However, if one ends at 2020-01-01 10:00 and the other starts at 2020-01-01 09:00 (same day) and the first event is the one that ends at 10:00, then they conflict.

   So we'll generate:

        Start Date: random from 2020-01-01 to 2029-12-31
        Start Time: random from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59

        End Date: random from the same day or the next day (or two days? Let's say we can have events that last up to 2 days, so end date can be the same, next, or two days after? Actually, we can have events that last longer, but we'll keep it to 1 or 2 days to avoid too many conflicts.)

        End Time: random from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59, but we must ensure that the time is after the start time (or if the same day, then after; if next day, then any time is after). However, we can also have events that start on a later day and end on an earlier day? No, because we are generating random dates and times, but we want the start to be before the end. So we'll generate the end date and time such that the entire event is in the future.

   We'll generate the start date and time, then the end date and time must be at least one second after the start.

   But note: we are in the 2020s, so we can have events that start and end in the same year, or span years.

   Let's generate the events and then check for conflicts.

   We'll create a list of events, and then we'll check every pair for conflict.

   Steps for generating:

        For each event:
            start_date = random date in 2020s (from 2020-01-01 to 2029-12-31)
            start_time = random time (from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59)

            Then, we'll generate an end date that is either the same day or one day after (or two days? Let's do one day to keep it simple) and then an end time that is after the start time (or if same day, then after; if next day, then any time is after). But we can also have events that last less than a day.

        However, we want to have some conflicts, so we can design a few events to have the same start and end time, or overlapping times.

   Let's do:

        We'll generate 30 events, but we'll set some of them to have overlapping times.

        We can do:

            Event 1: 2020-01-01 10:00 to 2020-01-01 12:00
            Event 2: 2020-01-01 11:00 to 2020-01-01 13:00

            Then Event 1 and Event 2 conflict.

        We can also have:

            Event 3: 2020-01-02 10:00 to 2020-01-02 12:00
            Event 4: 2020-01-02 11:00 to 2020-01-02 13:00

        And so on.

   But note: the problem says "Do not have the dates sorted", so we can have events on any day.

   We'll generate the events and then check for conflicts.

   We'll use:

        import random
        from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   We'll define a function to generate a random datetime in the 2020s.

   However, we want to control the duration so that we can have some conflicts. We can generate the start datetime and then the end datetime by adding a random duration (from 1 second to 2 days). But then we might have events that are very long and span multiple years, which is acceptable.

   But note: we are in the 2020s, so we can have events from 2020-01-01 to 2029-12-31, and the duration can be up to 2 days (so from 2020-01-01 to 2020-01-03, for example). But we can also have events that are longer, but let's keep the duration between 1 second and 2 days.

   Alternatively, we can generate the start and end dates separately, but then we have to ensure that the start is before the end.

   Let's do:

        start_date = random.choice of dates in the 2020s (we can generate a list of dates or use random)
        start_time = random time

        Then, we can set the end_date to be a random date from the start_date to start_date + 2 days (so we can have events that last up to 2 days). Then, the end_time must be after the start_time (if same day) or any time (if next day). But we can also have events that start on a later day and end on an earlier day? No, because we want the start to be before the end.

   We'll generate:

        start = random datetime in the 2020s (from 2020-01-01 00:00:00 to 2029-12-31 23:59:59)
        end = start + timedelta(days=random.randint(0,2), seconds=random.randint(0, 86399))

   But note: we want the events to be at least one second long, so we can set the minimum duration to 1 second.

   However, we are also asked to have some conflicts, so we can design a few events to have the same start and end time, or overlapping.

   But if we generate the end by adding a random duration, then we can have:

        Event 1: start = 2020-01-01 10:00:00, duration = 2 hours -> ends at 2020-01-01 12:00:00
        Event 2: start = 2020-01-01 11:00:00, duration = 2 hours -> ends at 2020-01-01 13:00:00

        Then Event 1 and Event 2 conflict.

   We can also have:

        Event 3: start = 2020-01-01 10:00:00, duration = 24 hours -> ends at 2020-01-02 10:00:00
        Event 4: start = 2020-01-01 10:00:00, duration = 24 hours -> ends at 2020-01-02 10:00:00

        Then Event 3 and Event 4 conflict.

   But note: we are generating 30 events, and we want to have some conflicts. We can design 5 events that are all happening at the same time (same start and end) and then they all conflict with each other.

   However, let's not make it too obvious. We can have:

        Event 1: 2020-01-01 10:00:00 to 2020-01-01 12:00:00
        Event 2: 2020-01-01 10:30:00 to 2020-01-01 11:30:00 -> conflicts with Event 1
        Event 3: 2020-01-01 11:00:00 to 2020-01-01 13:00:00 -> conflicts with Event 1 and Event 2
        Event 4: 2020-01-01 12:00:00 to 2020-01-01 14:00:00 -> conflicts with Event 3
        Event 5: 2020-01-01 10:00:00 to 2020-01-01 15:00:00 -> conflicts with all

   But note: we are generating 30 events, so we can have multiple such conflict groups.

   Alternatively, we can generate the events randomly and then adjust a few to cause conflicts.

   Let's do:

        We'll generate 30 random events (start and end) with the condition that the end is after the start and the duration is between 1 second and 2 days.

        Then, we'll check for conflicts and report.

   But the problem says "Try to make some of them conflict", so we can also design the events to have conflicts.

   We'll do:

        Generate 30 events, but we'll set 5 of them to be on the same day and time, and then they will conflict.

   However, let's not fix the day and time for the conflicting events, but we can set them to be in the same general time period.

   We'll generate:

        For 5 events, we'll set the start and end to be around the same time (say, 2020-01-01 10:00:00 to 2020-01-01 12:00:00) but with random variations.

   But note: the problem says "Do not have the dates sorted", so we can have the conflicting events on any day.

   Let's choose a random day for the conflicting events, but then set the time to be overlapping.

   We'll do:

        We'll generate 30 events, but we'll choose 5 of them to be on the same day (randomly chosen from the 2020s) and then set their start and end times to be overlapping.

   However, we are generating 30 events, so we can do:

        Step 1: Generate 30 random events (each with a random start and end) with the condition that the end is after the start and the duration is between 1 second and 2 days.

        Step 2: Then, we'll check for conflicts and report.

   But the problem says "Try to make some of them conflict", so we can also design the events to have conflicts by having two events that are scheduled at the same time.

   Let's do:

        We'll generate 30 events, but we'll set 5 events to have the same start and end time (or very close) to cause conflicts.

   However, we are to generate the events randomly, so we can't control the exact start and end time. But we can control the generation by having a base time and then perturbing it.

   Alternatively, we can generate the events and then if we want to have conflicts, we can adjust the start and end times of some events to be within the range of others.

   But note: the problem says "random", so we should not force the conflicts by adjusting the events after generation. We should generate the events and then let the conflict detection happen.

   However, the problem also says "Try to make some of them conflict", so we can design the generation to include some overlapping events.

   Let's do:

        We'll generate 30 events, but we'll choose 5 events and set their start and end times to be within a specific overlapping window.

   But that might be too controlled. Alternatively, we can generate the events and then if we want to have conflicts, we can set a few events to have the same start and end time.

   Since the problem doesn't specify the exact way to generate, I'll choose:

        Generate 30 events with random start and end times (each event's end time is after its start time, and the duration is between 1 second and 2 days). Then, we'll check for conflicts.

   But note: we are to have some conflicts, so we can design the generation to have a high chance of conflict for a few events.

   We can do:

        For the first 5 events, we'll generate the start time and then the end time by adding a small duration (like 1 hour) and then set the start time of the next 5 events to be within the previous 5 events' time.

   However, let's keep it simple and just generate 30 random events and then check for conflicts.

   We'll generate:

        start = random datetime in the 2020s (from 2020-01-01 00:00:00 to 2029-12-31 23:59:59)
        duration = random between 1 second and 2 days (so timedelta of days and seconds)

        Then, end = start + duration

   But note: we want the events to be at least one second long, so we can set the minimum duration to 1 second.

   We'll do:

        from datetime import datetime, timedelta
        import random

        start_year = 2020
        start_month = 1
        start_day = 1
        end_year = 2029
        end_month = 12
        end_day = 31

        start_min = datetime(start_year, start_month, start_day)
        start_max = datetime(end_year, end_month, end_day, 23, 59, 59)

        Then, for each event:

            start_dt = random datetime between start_min and start_max
            duration = random between 1 second and 2 days (so we can have up to 2 days, but note: we are generating the start_dt and then adding a duration that is at most 2 days, so the event must end by start_dt + 2 days)

            But note: the start_dt is already in the 2020s, and the duration is at most 2 days, so the event will end by 2029-12-31.

   However, we are generating the start_dt and then the end_dt, so we must ensure that the end_dt is after the start_dt and within the 2020s.

   We'll do:

        start_dt = random between start_min and start_max
        duration = timedelta(days=random.randint(0,2), seconds=random.randint(0, 86399))
        end_dt = start_dt + duration

        But note: the end_dt might be beyond 2029-12-31 if we are at the end of the year and add 2 days. So we have to cap the start_dt to be at most 2029-12-29 so that adding 2 days doesn't go beyond 2029-12-31.

   Alternatively, we can generate the start_dt and then the end_dt, and if the end_dt is beyond 2029-12-31, then we set the start_dt to be at most 2029-12-29.

   But note: the problem says the dates are in the 2020s, so we can have events that start and end in 2020, 2021, ... 2029.

   We'll generate the start_dt from 2020-01-01 to 2029-12-29 (so that adding 2 days doesn't exceed 2029-12-31) and then the end_dt will be from start_dt to start_dt+2 days.

   But note: we can also have events that start on 2029-12-30 and end on 2029-12-31 (1 day) or 2029-12-30 and end on 2030-01-01? No, because we are in the 2020s, so we don't want to go to 2030.

   So we'll set the start_dt to be from 2020-01-01 to 2029-12-29.

   Let's do:

        start_min = datetime(2020, 1, 1)
        start_max = datetime(2029, 12, 29, 23, 59, 59)

        Then, for each event:

            start_dt = random between start_min and start_max
            duration = timedelta(days=random.randint(0,2), seconds=random.randint(0, 86399))
            end_dt = start_dt + duration

        But note: the end_dt must be <= 2029-12-31. Since we are starting from 2029-12-29, adding 2 days will be 2029-12-31, which is acceptable.

   However, we can also have events that start on 2029-12-30 and end on 2029-12-31 (so duration of 1 day) or 2029-12-30 and end on 2030-01-01? We don't want that.

   So we'll adjust: the start_dt must be such that the end_dt is within 2029-12-31.

   We can do:

        start_dt = random between 2020-01-01 and 2029-12-29 (so that even if we add 2 days, we don't exceed 2029-12-31)

   But note: we can have events that start on 2029-12-30 and end on 2029-12-30 (same day) or 2029-12-30 and 2029-12-31 (1 day). So we can set the start_dt to be from 2020-01-01 to 2029-12-30, and then the duration must be at most 1 day (so that the event ends by 2029-12-31). But then we are limiting the duration to 1 day for events starting on 2029-12-30.

   Alternatively, we can generate the start_dt and then the end_dt, and if the end_dt is beyond 2029-12-31, then we set the end_dt to 2029-12-31 and adjust the duration accordingly.

   But that complicates the generation.

   Let's keep it simple: we'll generate the start_dt from 2020-01-01 to 2029-12-29, and then the end_dt will be from start_dt to start_dt+2 days. Then, we are guaranteed that the end_dt is within 2029-12-31.

   Now, we'll generate 30 events and then check for conflicts.

   We'll represent each event as:

        (event_name, start_dt, end_dt)

   Then, we'll write them to a CSV file with columns:

        Event Name, Start Date, Start Time, End Date, End Time

   We'll format the dates and times appropriately.

   Steps:

        1. Import modules.
        2. Define the date range.
        3. Generate 30 events.
        4. Write to CSV.
        5. Check for conflicts.

   Let's code accordingly.

   But note: we are to have some conflicts, so we can design the generation to have a higher chance of conflict for a few events.

   We can do:

        For the first 5 events, we'll generate the start_dt and then the end_dt by adding a small duration (like 1 hour) and then set the start_dt of the next 5 events to be within the previous 5 events' time.

   However, let's not do that and just generate randomly and then check. The problem says "random", so we should not force the conflicts.

   But note: the problem says "Try to make some of them conflict", so we can design the generation to have a few conflicts.

   We'll do:

        We'll generate 30 events, but we'll choose 5 events and set their start and end times to be the same (or very close) as a few others.

   Alternatively, we can generate the events and then if we want to have conflicts, we can set a few events to be on the same day and time.

   Let's do:

        We'll generate 30 events, but we'll set 5 events to be on the same day (randomly chosen from the 2020s) and at the same time (randomly chosen from the day) and then they will conflict.

   But note: we are generating the events randomly, so we can't control the exact day and time. However, we can generate the events and then if we want to have conflicts, we can adjust the generation of a few events.

   Since the problem is about generating a fictional list, we can design the events to have conflicts by having two events that are scheduled at the same time.

   We'll do:

        We'll generate 30 events, but we'll choose 5 events and set their start and end times to be the same as a randomly chosen event from the first 5.

   But that might be too obvious.

   Let's change the plan: we'll generate 30 events, and then we'll check for conflicts. We'll report the conflicts.

   We'll generate:

        start_dt = random between 2020-01-01 and 2029-12-29 (so that the event doesn't end after 2029-12-31)
        duration = random between 1 second and 2 days (so we can have up to 2 days)

        Then, end_dt = start_dt + duration

   We'll then check for conflicts by comparing every pair.

   We'll write the events to a CSV file and then print the conflicts.

   Let's code accordingly.

   However, note: the problem says "Do not have the dates sorted", so we are generating randomly and then we'll have the events in random order.

   We'll generate the events and then check for conflicts.

   We'll use:

        import random
        from datetime import datetime, timedelta

   We'll create a list of events.

   We'll also assign random names to the events.

   Let's do:

        event_names = ['Event ' + str(i) for i in range(1, 31)]

   Then, for each event, we generate a start_dt and end_dt.

   We'll then check for conflicts.

   We'll define a function to check for conflicts:

        def has_conflict(event1, event2):
            # event1 and event2 are (start, end) datetime objects
            if event1[0] < event2[1] and event2[0] < event1[1]:
                return True
            return False

   But note: we are representing events as (name, start_dt, end_dt). We can store the events as a list of tuples (name, start_dt, end_dt).

   Then, we'll check every pair.

   However, we are generating 30 events, so we can have up to 30*29/2 = 435 pairs. We don't want to report every pair, but we can report the conflicting events.

   We'll do:

        conflicts = []
        for i in range(len(events)):
            for j in range(i+1, len(events)):
                if has_conflict(events[i], events[j]):
                    conflicts.append((events[i][0], events[j][0]))

        Then, we can print the conflicting events.

   But note: the problem says "which of the events you generated have conflicted", so we can list the event names that are involved in a conflict.

   However, we might have multiple conflicts for the same event.

   We'll do:

        We'll generate the events and then check for conflicts.

   Let's code accordingly.

   But note: we are to have some conflicts, so we can design the generation to have a higher chance of conflict for a few events.

   We can do:

        For the first 5 events, we'll generate the start_dt and then the end_dt by adding a small duration (like 1 hour) and then set the start_dt of the next 5 events to be within the previous 5 events' time.

   However, let's not do that and just generate randomly and then check. The problem says "random", so we should not force the conflicts.

   But note: the problem says "Try to make some of them conflict", so we can design the generation to have a few conflicts.

   We'll do:

        We'll generate 30 events, but we'll choose 5 events and set their start and end times to be the same as a randomly chosen event from the first 5.

   Alternatively, we can generate the events and then if we want to have conflicts, we can set a few events to be on the same day and time.

   Let's do:

        We'll generate 30 events, but we'll choose 5 events and set their start and end times to be the same as a randomly chosen event from the first 5.

   But that might be too obvious.
