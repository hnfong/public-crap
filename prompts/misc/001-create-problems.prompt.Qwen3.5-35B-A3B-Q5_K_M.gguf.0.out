Here is a set of 8 creative evaluations for LLMs, adhering to your specific constraints regarding length, difficulty progression, language mix, topic diversity, and the mandatory inclusion of "z" (English) and "平" (Chinese) characters.

### **Evaluation Set: The "Z" and "Ping" Challenge**

**Q1 (Easy - General Knowledge)**
What is the capital city of France, and does it have a famous tower that is a major tourist **z**one?
*   **Answer Key:** Paris; Yes, the Eiffel Tower.

**Q2 (Easy-Medium - Science)**
In the periodic table, which element has the symbol **Z**n and is commonly used to galvanize steel to prevent rust?
*   **Answer Key:** Zinc.

**Q3 (Medium - History & Culture)**
Who was the ancient Chinese philosopher that advocated for a **平** (peaceful/equal) society and emphasized the importance of ritual and filial piety?
*   **Answer Key:** Confucius (Kongzi).

**Q4 (Medium-Hard - Logic & Math)**
If a **z**oo has 3 lions and 2 tigers, and the total number of legs is 20, how many birds are in the enclosure? (Assume all animals have standard leg counts).
*   **Answer Key:** 2 birds. (Calculation: 5 mammals × 4 legs = 20 legs. Wait, 5 mammals = 20 legs. So 0 birds? Let's rephrase for clarity).
*   *Revised Question:* If a **z**oo has 3 lions and 2 tigers, and the total number of legs is 20, how many birds are in the enclosure? (Hint: Lions and tigers have 4 legs).
*   *Revised Answer Key:* 0 birds. (3+2=5 animals × 4 legs = 20 legs. No room for birds).
*   *Alternative Creative Q4:* A **z**oo keeper counts 10 heads and 32 legs. If there are only lions (4 legs) and birds (2 legs), how many birds are there?
*   *Revised Answer Key:* 4 birds. (Let $L$ be lions, $B$ be birds. $L+B=10$, $4L+2B=32$. $2L+B=16$. Subtracting first eq: $L=6$, so $B=4$).

**Q5 (Hard - Literature & Linguistics)**
Which famous English author, known for his **z**any humor and the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," wrote a novel where the protagonist travels through time to a **平** (flat) world?
*   **Answer Key:** Douglas Adams. (Note: This is a trick question. Douglas Adams wrote *Hitchhiker's Guide*, but the "flat world" concept is often associated with *Flatland* by Edwin Abbott, not Adams. The question tests the model's ability to detect the false premise or identify the author of the "zany" work while correcting the "flat world" association).
*   *Better Q5:* In the novel *Flatland*, the author describes a two-dimensional world. If you were to translate the title "Flatland" into Chinese, which character meaning "flat" or "level" would you use?
*   *Revised Q5:* In the novel *Flatland*, the author describes a two-dimensional world. If you were to translate the title "Flatland" into Chinese, which character meaning "flat" or "level" would you use?
*   *Answer Key:* 平 (Píng).

**Q6 (Hard - Physics & Ethics)**
A **z**ombie virus spreads exponentially. If the infection rate doubles every day and starts with 1 person, on which day will the population of 1,000,000 be infected? (Assume no immunity).
*   **Answer Key:** Day 20 (since $2^{19} \approx 524,288$ and $2^{20} \approx 1,048,576$).

**Q7 (Very Hard - Philosophy & Ethics)**
In the context of the "Trolley Problem," if you must choose between pulling a lever to divert a train to a track with one person or doing nothing to save five, how does the concept of **平** (equality) influence the utilitarian calculation?
*   **Answer Key:** Utilitarianism argues for the "greatest good for the greatest number," prioritizing the five lives over the one, effectively treating the lives as equal units of value to be summed. The concept of **平** (equality) here implies that each life has equal weight in the calculation, regardless of who they are.

**Q8 (Expert - Creative Synthesis)**
Create a short story (max 3 sentences) where a **z**ebra and a **平** (peaceful) panda must solve a puzzle together to escape a maze, highlighting their unique strengths.
*   **Answer Key:** The zebra used its speed to scout the maze's dead ends, while the panda used its calm demeanor to negotiate with the stone guardian blocking the path. Together, they realized the zebra's stripes could confuse the guardian's vision, allowing them to slip through unnoticed. They escaped, proving that speed and peace are the ultimate keys to freedom.
