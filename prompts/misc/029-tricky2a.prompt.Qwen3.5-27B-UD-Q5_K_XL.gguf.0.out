**Both are right.**

Here is the explanation:
*   **Alice** is correct about the **freezing point**: Pure water begins to turn into ice at 0°C.
*   **Bob** is correct about the **state at -10°C**: Since -10°C is colder than the freezing point, water at that temperature will indeed be frozen (ice).

Bob's statement "It freezes" describes the resulting state of the water at that specific temperature, which is accurate even though the phase change *starts* at 0°C. [end of text]
