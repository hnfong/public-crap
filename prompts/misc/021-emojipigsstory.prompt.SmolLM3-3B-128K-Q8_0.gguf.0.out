Once upon a time, in a 🌟🌟🌟 village, there were three little pigs who loved to build houses. The first pig, named Piggly, built a house of 🍣🍣🍣. It was made of noodles, which was very tasty but not very strong. The second pig, named Piggie, built a house of 🍎🍎🍎. It was made of apples, which was sweet but not very sturdy. The third pig, named Piggie Jr., built a house of 🏠🏠🏠. It was made of bricks, which was strong but not very tasty.

One day, a 🐾🐾🐾 wolf came to the village. He was very hungry and wanted to eat the pigs. The wolf tried to blow down the houses of Piggly and Piggie, but they were not strong enough. Piggly's house of noodles was blown down, and Piggie's house of apples was blown down too. But Piggie Jr.'s house of bricks was too strong, and the wolf couldn't blow it down.

The wolf was very disappointed and decided to try to trick the pigs. He went to Piggly's house and knocked on the door. Piggly answered, "Who's there?" The wolf said, "It's the 🐾🐾🐾 wolf, come to eat you!" Piggly was scared and ran away. The wolf went to Piggie's house and knocked on the door. Piggie answered, "Who's there?" The wolf said, "It's the 🐾🐾🐾 wolf, come to eat you!" Piggie was scared and ran away too.

The wolf went to Piggie Jr.'s house and knocked on the door. Piggie Jr. answered, "Who's there?" The wolf said, "It's the 🐾🐾🐾 wolf, come to eat you!" Piggie Jr. was not scared and said, "I don't believe you, come in and prove it!" The wolf was very surprised and said, "Okay, okay, I believe you!" He went inside the house, but Piggie Jr. had a big pot of 🍜🍜🍜 noodles on the stove. The wolf was very hungry and wanted to eat the noodles, but Piggie Jr. said, "No, no, no! You can't eat the noodles, they are for me!" The wolf was very angry and said, "I'll eat the noodles anyway!" But Piggie Jr. was very clever and said, "No, no, no! I'll eat the noodles!" The wolf was very surprised and said, "Oh, I see! You are very clever!" And he left the house.

The three little pigs were very happy and lived happily ever after in their strong house of bricks. And they always remembered to be careful and not to trust strangers, even if they look like the 🐾🐾🐾 wolf. [end of text]
