Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (or 32 degrees Fahrenheit). Bob is mistaken because he is conflating the freezing point of water with the temperature at which it becomes solid. At -10 degrees Celsius, water is actually in a liquid state, not frozen. The freezing point of water is a specific temperature that is consistently 0 degrees Celsius. [end of text]
