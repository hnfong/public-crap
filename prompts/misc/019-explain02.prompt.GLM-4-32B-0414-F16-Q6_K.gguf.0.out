Okay, imagine you live in London, right? You have your mummy and daddy who make the rules for your house, like "no jumping on the sofa" or "eat your dinner".

Now, think about China. It's a *huge* place, much bigger than London! It has lots and lots of people, maybe like having a giant playground with thousands and thousands of kids.

China also needs rules to help everyone live together nicely, just like your house rules. But because China is so big, they need a special group of people to help make those rules.

That special group is called the **National People's Congress**. You can think of them like the **biggest grown-ups in China** who get together to talk about what rules the whole country should have.

They sit in a big room and discuss things, like how to make sure everyone has food, or how to keep the country safe, or how to build nice schools and roads, just like the grown-ups in London talk about things too.

So, the National People's Congress is like the main group of rule-makers for all of China, helping to decide how the big country should work. They make the really important decisions for everyone there. [end of text]
