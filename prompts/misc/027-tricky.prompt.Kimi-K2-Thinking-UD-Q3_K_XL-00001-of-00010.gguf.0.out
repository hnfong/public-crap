The user asks two questions about water freezing at -12°C. I need to provide brief explanations.

A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?
Yes, water freezes at -12°C under normal atmospheric pressure. The freezing point of pure water is 0°C. At -12°C, which is below 0°C, water will freeze. However, I should mention that this assumes standard conditions and pure water. The question is a bit ambiguous: does it mean "Is -12°C a temperature at which water can freeze?" or "Will water *always* freeze at -12°C?". The answer is yes, it will freeze. I should be precise. The freezing point of water is 0°C (32°F) at standard atmospheric pressure. Any temperature below this, including -12°C, is sufficient for water to freeze, *provided* there are nucleation sites. I should briefly mention supercooling as a nuance, but the general answer is yes.

B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?
This is a more specific scenario. If you take a glass of pure water and cool it down to -12°C, it will freeze. However, there is a nuance: supercooling. If the water is very pure and the cooling is done slowly without disturbance, it might remain liquid below its freezing point (supercooled). But in a typical glass with impurities and some disturbance, it will freeze. The question says "pure water", which increases the chance of supercooling. But the most likely outcome, especially if it's just sitting in a freezer, is that it will freeze. I should explain this briefly.

Let me structure the answers:
A) Direct answer: Yes. Explanation: The freezing point of water is 0°C. -12°C is below that, so water will freeze at this temperature under normal conditions. I can add a tiny bit about supercooling as a caveat.

B) Direct answer: It will freeze (likely). Explanation: Since -12°C is well below the freezing point (0°C), the water will turn into ice. However, if the water is extremely pure and undisturbed, it might supercool and remain liquid temporarily until a nucleation event triggers freezing. But for a typical glass of water, it will freeze.

I need to keep the explanations brief as requested.

Let's refine the answers:

A) Yes. Water's freezing point is 0°C. At -12°C, which is below this temperature, water will freeze into ice under standard atmospheric pressure, assuming there are nucleation sites (like impurities or the container surface). Without nucleation, it can supercool, but this is less common.

B) The water will freeze. As it cools past 0°C, it will undergo a phase transition from liquid to solid (ice). If the water is very pure and cooled slowly without disturbance, it might temporarily remain liquid (supercooled), but it will freeze upon agitation or contact with a nucleation site. In a typical freezer setting, it will freeze solid.

The user asks for "brief explanations". I should keep it concise.

A) Yes. Water freezes at any temperature below its freezing point of 0°C under normal conditions. At -12°C, it will turn into ice.

B) It will freeze. The water will turn into ice as it is cooled below 0°C. If it's very pure and undisturbed, it might supercool temporarily, but it will freeze solid upon any disturbance or once nucleation begins.

This seems good. I should be clear and accurate. The term "pure water" in question B is key for the supercooling aspect. I should address that.

Final check:
- Is the answer to A correct? Yes. -12°C < 0°C, so water freezes.
- Is the answer to B correct? Yes. It will freeze. The supercooling nuance is important for "pure water".

I will write the final response. I should make it clear and easy to understand. I'll use separate paragraphs for A and B.

A) Yes. Water's normal freezing point is 0°C. At -12°C, it will freeze into ice, assuming standard pressure and the presence of nucleation sites (like impurities or the container). Without nucleation, pure water can supercool, but this is unstable.

B) It will freeze. Cooling pure water to -12°C (well below its 0°C freezing point) will cause it to solidify into ice. While very pure, still water can sometimes supercool and remain liquid briefly, any disturbance or impurity will trigger rapid freezing. In a typical freezer, it will freeze solid.

This is brief and accurate. I think this is ready.**A) Yes.** Water freezes at any temperature below its freezing point of 0°C. At -12°C, it will turn into ice under normal atmospheric pressure, provided there are nucleation sites (like impurities or the container surface) to initiate crystallization.

**B) It will freeze.** As the water cools past 0°C, it will solidify into ice. While extremely pure, undisturbed water can sometimes supercool and remain liquid briefly below its freezing point, in a typical setting it will freeze solid by -12°C. Any small disturbance or impurity will trigger rapid freezing. [end of text]
