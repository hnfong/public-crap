==========
Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (at standard atmospheric pressure). At -10 degrees Celsius, water is already frozen (as ice). Bob's initial statement ("It freezes") is technically true but misleading because the freezing process (the phase transition from liquid to solid) occurs at 0°C, not -10°C. At -10°C, the water is already in its solid state. 

Bob's claim that he's "still right" is technically correct in the sense that water at -10°C is indeed frozen, but his initial phrasing was imprecise. Alice's correction is more accurate because it addresses the freezing point (the temperature at which the phase change occurs). 

In summary:  
- Alice is right about the freezing point (0°C).  
- Bob is right that water at -10°C is frozen, but his initial statement was ambiguous.  
The key distinction is between the freezing point (where the phase change happens) and the state of water below that temperature.</think>Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0°C (at standard atmospheric pressure), meaning the phase transition from liquid to solid occurs at that temperature. At -10°C, water is already frozen (as ice), but the freezing process itself happens at 0°C. Bob's statement ("It freezes") is technically true but misleading because it implies the freezing is occurring at -10°C, which is not the case. Bob's claim that he's "still right" ignores the distinction between the freezing point (0°C) and the state of water below that temperature. Alice accurately identified the freezing point, making her the correct one.
