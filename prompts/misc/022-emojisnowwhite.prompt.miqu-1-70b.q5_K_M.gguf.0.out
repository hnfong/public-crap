Translation:
Once upon a time, there was a princess 👸🏻 who lived with her evil stepmother 👵🏻 in a castle 🏰 surrounded by a forest 🌲🌳. One day, she befriended some woodland creatures 🐦🐇🐿️ and they warned her about her stepmother's plan to harm her.

The evil queen disguised herself as an old peddler and offered Snow White a poisoned apple 🍎🍯. Snow White took a bite and fell into a deep sleep 💤💉😴💀. The seven dwarfs 👫🏻👭🏻 who had taken her in found her and were devastated.

They placed her in a glass coffin 🕰️ and kept watch over her. One day, a prince 👨🏻‍🤝‍👨🏻 came across her and was captivated by her beauty. He kissed her 💏🏻 and she woke up. They fell in love and got married 👸🏻👑. And they lived happily ever after. [end of text]
