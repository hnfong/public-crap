Answer the following questions with brief explanations.

A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees celsius?
B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees celsius?

Here are brief answers with explanations for both questions:

**A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?**
**No**
* Explanation: The freezing point of pure water at standard atmospheric pressure is 0 degrees Celsius (°C). Water will not freeze at -12°C under normal conditions. In fact, it's already below the freezing point, but more on that in the next answer.

**B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?**
**It will likely be in a supercooled state, but eventually freeze or rapidly solidify if disturbed.**
* Explanation:
	1. **Initial Cooling to 0°C**: As the water is cooled to 0°C, it will start to freeze, turning into ice. This is the normal freezing point of water.
	2. **Cooling Below 0°C to -12°C**:
		* **Supercooling**: If the water is pure (free of nucleation sites like dust, impurities, or container wall imperfections) and cooled slowly and carefully, it might not freeze at 0°C. Instead, it can enter a **supercooled** state, remaining liquid below its freezing point.
		* **Eventual Freezing at -12°C**: At -12°C, the water is significantly below its freezing point. If the supercooled water is disturbed (e.g., by shaking, introducing an impurity, or coming into contact with a cold surface), it will rapidly freeze or solidify. This process is known as **flash freezing**. If left undisturbed, it might remain supercooled for a period, but eventual freezing is highly likely due to the significant temperature difference from its freezing point. [end of text]
