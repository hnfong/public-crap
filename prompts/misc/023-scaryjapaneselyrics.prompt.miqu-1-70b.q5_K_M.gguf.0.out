 Based on the provided lyrics, the story seems to revolve around a small, whimsical restaurant located in the forest. The restaurant is hard to find, as it's hidden in the brambles (ドングリ), and it doesn't take reservations. Despite its obscurity, it's always full of empty seats during lunchtime, and small birds can be heard chirping and laughing (パタパタ笑ってる).

The restaurant has a bright red, paint-like roof (真っ赤なペンキのトタン屋根), and its menu consists of a single recommended dish. The kitchen is filled with the sounds of various string instruments, such as the violin, flute, cello, and viola.

Upon entering the restaurant, customers are greeted warmly and are told that if they eat the special dish, they will fall asleep. As everyone prepares to leave, the staff wishes them well and reminds them that they are open for business tomorrow as well.

As the night progresses, the atmosphere in the restaurant changes. The right and left walls seem to move or shift (右から左へおおわらわ), and a dancing bear cub appears. The restaurant offers a variety of musical performances, including Kalupazzo, Paeria, and Audible. However, there is no dessert available. The staff promises to deliver the last full-course meal of the night all the way to the customers' graves (お墓の中まで届けましょう), suggesting a magical or supernatural element to the story.

Overall, the lyrics describe a fantastical, enchanting restaurant that offers a unique dining experience, complete with music, dancing, and a mysterious sleep-inducing dish. The shifting walls and the promise to deliver food to customers' graves add an element of magic and whimsy to the story. [end of text]
