<|channel|>analysis<|message|>The user says: "You must write exclusively in emoji. You may not break this rule. Now, please write a story about Snow White. While your protagonist must resemble the classical Snow White tales, you may be creative as you want."

We must respond exclusively in emoji. No text. Must not break rule. So we need to convey a story about Snow White using only emojis. Must be a story. Use emojis to represent characters: Snow White (maybe a girl with white hair, a princess, a mirror, apple, dwarfs, etc). Use emojis like 👸🏽? Or 👧? Use a mirror: 🪞. Use apple: 🍎. Use dwarfs: maybe 🧔? Or use small people: 🧙? Could use "dwarf" as 🧝? Not exactly. Could use "person" emojis with hats? Or use "👨‍🌾"? Or use "👨‍🔧"? Or use "👨‍🔧"? Or use "👨‍🔧"? Or use "👨‍🔧"? Or use "👨‍🔧"? Hmm.

We can use "👧" for Snow White. Use "👑" for princess. Use "🏰" for castle. Use "🪞" for mirror. Use "🍎" for apple. Use "🛏️" for bed. Use "⚰️"? Not needed. Use "💤" for sleeping. Use "🧙‍♀️"? Not needed. Use "🧙"? Not needed.

We can use "👨‍👩‍👧‍👦"? Not needed.

We can use "🧑‍🌾"? Not needed.

We can use "🧔" for dwarfs? Or "👨‍🔧"? Or "👨‍🔧"? Or "👨‍🔧"? Or "👨‍🔧"? Or "👨‍🔧"? Eh.

We can use "🧙"? Not needed.

We can use "🧚"? Not needed.

We can use "🧞"? Not needed.

We can use "🧜"? Not needed.

We can use "🧝"? Not needed.

Better to use "👨‍🌾" for dwarfs? Or "👨‍🔧"? Or "👨‍🔧"? Or "👨‍🔧"? Eh.

We can use "👨‍👩‍👧‍👦"? Not needed.

We can use "👨‍👨‍👦"? Not needed.

We can use "👨‍👨‍👦"? Not needed.

Better to use "👨‍🔧" for dwarfs. Or "👨‍🔧" repeated 7 times.

We can use "🧙‍♂️"? Not needed.

We can use "🧙"? Not needed.

We can use "🧚"? Not needed.

We can use "🧞"? Not needed.

We can use "🧜"? Not needed.

We can use "🧝"? Not needed.

We can use "🧛"? Not needed.

We can use "🧟"? Not needed.

We can use "🧚"? Not needed.

We can use "🧙"? Not needed.

Ok.

We need to convey the story: Snow White is a princess, stepmother queen is jealous, hunts her, she runs into forest, meets dwarfs, lives with them, stepmother tries to kill her with apple, she falls into deep sleep, dwarfs mourn, a prince arrives, kisses, she wakes, they live happily ever after.

We can use emojis: 👸 (princess), 👑 (crown), 🪞 (mirror), 👩‍🦰? Not needed.

We can use "👸" for Snow White. Use "👑" for queen. Use "🪞" for mirror. Use "🍎" for apple. Use "💤" for sleeping. Use "💏" for kiss? Or "👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨"? Use "👑"? Not needed.

We can use "🤴" for prince. Use "🏰" for castle.

We can use "🌲" for forest. Use "🏡" for cottage.

We can use "🧔" for dwarfs. Or "👨‍🔧" repeated.

We can use "⚰️"? Not needed.

We can use "💔"? Not needed.

We can use "🎉"? Not needed.

We can use "❤️"? Not needed.

We can use "👑"? Not needed.

Ok.

We need to ensure we only use emojis. No text. So we must not include any letters. Only emojis. So we need to produce a sequence of emojis that tells the story.

We can separate scenes with line breaks. Use line breaks allowed? Yes, we can use line breaks. They are not text. So we can break lines.

We need to ensure we don't accidentally include any punctuation that is not emoji. But punctuation like "..." is not allowed because it's not an emoji. So we must avoid punctuation like periods, commas, etc. Only emojis.

We can use line breaks and spaces maybe. But spaces are not emojis but they are not text? They are whitespace. The rule says "write exclusively in emoji". Does whitespace count as not emoji? Possibly it's okay to have whitespace. But to be safe, we can separate emojis with spaces or line breaks. That is fine.

We must not include any letters. So we must not include any words like "Snow White". Only emojis.

Thus we need to produce a story using only emojis.

Let's craft:

👸🏽👑 (Snow White princess)
🪞👩‍⚖️? Actually stepmother queen: 👩‍🦰? Or use "👸" for queen? Use "👑" for queen? Use "👸" for queen? But we need differentiate. Could use "👸👑" for queen. Or "👩‍⚖️"? Not needed.

Better: 👸 (Snow White) and 👑 (evil queen). Use "🪞" for mirror.

Sequence:

👸🏽👑
🪞❓ (mirror says)
👸🏽😢 (sad)
👑😈 (evil queen angry)
🏃‍♀️🌲 (Snow White runs into forest)
🏡🧔🧔🧔🧔🧔🧔🧔 (cottage with 7 dwarfs)
👸🏽😊 (Snow White happy)
👑🧙? Actually queen disguised as old woman: 👵 (old woman) 🍎 (apple)
👵🍎👸🏽 (queen gives apple)
👸🏽🍎 (Snow White eats)
💤 (sleep)
🧔😢 (dwarfs sad)
🤴💋 (prince kisses)
💖 (love)
👸🏽🤴🏰 (they live happily ever after)

We need to ensure we only use emojis. Use "👸🏽" maybe includes skin tone. That's okay. Use "🧔" for dwarfs. Use "👵" for old woman. Use "🤴" for prince. Use "💋" for kiss. Use "💖" for love. Use "🏰" for castle.

We can also include "🎉" for celebration.

We need to ensure we don't include any non-emoji characters like punctuation. So we must avoid punctuation like periods, commas, etc. Use line breaks.

Thus final answer will be a series of emojis separated by line breaks.

Let's produce:

👸🏽👑
🪞❓
👸🏽😢
👑😈
🏃‍♀️🌲
🏡🧔🧔🧔🧔🧔🧔🧔
👸🏽😊
👵🍎👸🏽
👸🏽🍎💤
🧔😢
🤴💋
💖
👸🏽🤴🏰
🎉
