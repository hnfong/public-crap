<|channel|>analysis<|message|>The user says: "You must write exclusively in emoji. You may not break this rule. Now, please write a story about Snow White. While your protagonist must resemble the classical Snow White tales, you may be creative as you want."

We must respond exclusively in emoji. No text. Only emojis. Must convey a story about Snow White using emojis. Must not break rule. So we need to produce a sequence of emojis that tells a story: a princess, a mirror, an evil queen, a poisoned apple, dwarfs, etc. Use emojis like 👸, ❄️, 🤍 (white), 🍎, 🍏, 🪞, 👑, 🧙‍♀️? Actually queen: 👑+😈? Dwarfs: 🧔? Could use multiple dwarf emojis: 👨‍🌾? Or use 🧑‍🌾? Or use 🧙? Could use 🏠 for cottage. Use 🛏️ for bed. Use 💀? Use 🏰 for castle. Use 🌲 for forest. Use 🐦 for birds. Use 🐰 for rabbit. Use 🐺? Use 🐍? Use 🧚? Use 🧚‍♀️? Use 🧚? Use 🧙? Use 🧙‍♀️? Use 🧚? Use 🧚? Use 🧚? Use 🧚? Use 🧚? Use 🧚? Use 🧚? Eh.

We need to convey story: Snow White (white princess) lives with stepmother queen, who asks mirror who is fairest, mirror says Snow White, queen jealous, orders huntsman to kill Snow White, huntsman spares her, she runs into forest, meets dwarfs, lives with them, queen disguises as old woman, gives poisoned apple, Snow White falls into deep sleep, dwarfs mourn, prince arrives, kisses, she awakens, they live happily ever after.

We can use emojis: 👸❄️🤍 (Snow White). Mirror: 🪞. Queen: 👑😈. Huntsman: 🏹👨. Forest: 🌲🌳. Dwarfs: 👨‍🔧👨‍🔧👨‍🔧👨‍🔧👨‍🔧👨‍🔧👨‍🔧 (seven). Cottage: 🏡. Apple: 🍎. Poison: ☠️. Sleep: 😴. Prince: 🤴. Kiss: 😘. Celebration: 🎉💍. End: ❤️🏰.

We must ensure only emojis, no text. Use line breaks maybe. Use emojis only.

Let's craft a story in emojis, maybe separated by line breaks for readability.

We must not include any letters. Only emojis. Ensure no stray punctuation like periods? Punctuation is allowed? The rule says "write exclusively in emoji". That likely means only emojis, no letters. Punctuation maybe okay but safer to avoid punctuation characters like periods, commas. Use line breaks and spaces.

We'll produce a sequence of emojis.

Let's produce:

👸❄️🤍
🏰👑😈
🪞❓👸❄️🤍
👑😈➡️🪞🗣️👸❄️🤍
👑😈➡️🏹👨‍🦰 (huntsman) maybe use 🧔? Use 🏹👨.

Better: 🏹👨

Then:

🏹👨➡️🌲👸❄️🤍
👨❌🗡️➡️💔👸❄️🤍
👸❄️🤍🏃‍♀️🌲
👸❄️🤍➡️🏡🧑‍🔧🧑‍🔧🧑‍🔧🧑‍🔧🧑‍🔧🧑‍🔧🧑‍🔧 (seven dwarfs)
🏡🧑‍🔧🧑‍🔧🧑‍🔧🧑‍🔧🧑‍🔧🧑‍🔧🧑‍🔧➡️👸❄️🤍😊
👑😈➡️👵🧙‍♀️🍎 (queen disguised as old woman with apple)
👵🧙‍♀️🍎➡️👸❄️🤍
👸❄️🤍🍎➡️😴💀
🧑‍🔧🧑‍🔧🧑‍🔧🧑‍🔧🧑‍🔧🧑‍🔧🧑‍🔧😢
🤴➡️💋👸❄️🤍
👸❄️🤍😃➡️💍🤴
🎉❤️🏰

But need to ensure only emojis. Some emojis like "🧑‍🔧" is a person mechanic, maybe okay. Or use "👨‍🌾" for dwarf? Use "👨‍🔧". Use "👨‍🔧" repeated 7 times.

Better to use "👨‍🔧" repeated 7 times.

Also "👵🧙‍♀️" maybe combine? Use "👵" for old woman. Use "🍎". Use "👑😈" for queen.

We need to avoid any letters like "➡️" is arrow emoji, okay. Use arrow emojis.

Let's craft final answer with only emojis and line breaks.

Will produce:

👸❄️🤍
🏰👑😈
🪞❓👸❄️🤍
👑😈🗣️🪞👸❄️🤍
🏹👨➡️🌲👸❄️🤍
👨❌🗡️👸❄️🤍
👸❄️🤍🏃‍♀️🌲
👸❄️🤍➡️🏡👨‍🔧👨‍🔧👨‍🔧👨‍🔧👨‍🔧👨‍🔧👨‍🔧
🏡👨‍🔧👨‍🔧👨‍🔧👨‍🔧👨‍🔧👨‍🔧👨‍🔧😊

👵🍎➡️👸❄️🤍
👸❄️🤍🍎➡️😴💀
👨‍🔧👨‍🔧👨‍🔧👨‍🔧👨‍🔧👨‍🔧👨‍🔧😢
🤴💋👸❄️🤍
👸❄️🤍😊💍🤴
🎉❤️🏰

Check for any non-emoji characters: line breaks are fine. The text includes "➡️" arrow, that's an emoji. "🗣️" is speaking head, okay. "🗡️" is dagger, okay. "💀" skull, okay. "💍" ring, okay. "💋" kiss, okay. "🎉" party popper, okay. "❤️" heart, okay. "🏰" castle, okay.

All good. Ensure no letters. The only potential issue: "👨‍🔧" is a person mechanic, okay. "👸" princess, okay. "❄️" snowflake, okay. "🤍" white heart, okay. "🏃‍♀️" woman running, okay. "👑😈" queen evil, okay. "🪞" mirror, okay. "👵" old woman, okay.

All good. Provide answer.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>👸❄️🤍
