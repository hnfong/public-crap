The output of the command you've written is a sorted list of the 20 most common words in your World of Warcraft fan fiction, along with their respective counts. Here's a breakdown of what each part of the command does:

1. `cat wowfanfic.txt`: This command outputs the contents of the file `wowfanfic.txt`.

2. `| perl -ne '@a = split(/\s/); foreach (@a) { print $_ . "\n"; }'`: This Perl one-liner splits each line of input into words (assuming words are separated by whitespace) and then prints each word on a new line. This effectively tokenizes the text into individual words.

3. `| sort`: This command sorts the words alphabetically.

4. `| uniq -c`: This command counts the occurrences of each unique word. The output will be a list of words, each followed by the number of times it appears.

5. `| sort -n`: This command sorts the output of `uniq -c` numerically, so the words are listed in order of their frequency, from most common to least common.

6. `| tail -n 20`: This command outputs the last 20 lines of the sorted list, which will be the 20 most common words in the text, along with their counts.

**Explanation with respect to basic linguistic principles:**

- **Tokenization**: The Perl command splits the text into tokens (words) based on whitespace. This is a basic step in Natural Language Processing (NLP) where text is broken down into individual meaningful elements.

- **Frequency Counting**: The `uniq -c` command counts the frequency of each token. In linguistics, this is akin to a simple form of text analysis where the frequency of words can give insights into the themes, style, and vocabulary of the text.

- **Sorting**: Sorting the words by frequency is a way to identify the most salient or common elements of the text. In linguistic analysis, this can help identify key themes or stylistic elements.

- **Limiting to 20**: By limiting the output to the 20 most common words, the command provides a concise summary of the most significant lexical elements in the text. In linguistic terms, these words are likely to be function words (like "the", "and", "of") and content words that are central to the narrative or theme of the fan fiction.

**Probable Output Explanation**:
The output will be a list of the 20 most common words in your fan fiction, each followed by the number of times it appears. For example, it might look like this (hypothetical data):

    the 123
    and 89
    warcraft 78
    world 67
    characters 56
    ...
    lore 5
    (and 17 more lines for the top 20 words)

This output reflects the most frequently used words in your text, which could include common English words, names of characters, locations, or key terms from the World of Warcraft universe. The frequency of these words can give a glimpse into the focus and style of your fan fiction. [end of text]
