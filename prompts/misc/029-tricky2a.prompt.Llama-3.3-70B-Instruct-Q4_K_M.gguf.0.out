Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Bob is right. At -10 degrees Celsius, water is already frozen, so it remains frozen. Bob's statement "it freezes" implies a change of state, but in this case, the water would have already frozen at 0 degrees Celsius, and at -10 degrees Celsius, it would simply remain in its frozen state.
