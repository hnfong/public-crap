Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

Yo, listen up, let me break it down,
Talkin' 'bout the Fed, the big money crown,
The Federal Reserve, yeah, that's their name,
They're the ones in charge, playin' the finance game.

It's like they're the DJ, spinnin' the tunes,
Controllin' the cash flow, makin' the moves,
They watch over the banks, keep 'em in line,
Make sure the economy don't go off thecline.

They set the interest rates, that's their main gig,
Influence how much banks charge for that big dig,
When they raise 'em up, it's harder to spend,
When they lower 'em down, the money flows, my friend.

They're also the lender of last resort, you see,
When banks need a bailout, they come to the Fed, yo,
It's like the Fed's got the stash of emergency cash,
Helps keep the system steady, and prevent the crash.

The Fed issues the dollars, that green paper we all chase,
Controls the money supply, sets the pace,
They're the ones that print the dough, keep the economy in check,
Make sure we don't end up in a financial wreck.

So next time you're stackin' your cash, or makin' a deal,
Remember the Fed's got a hand in how the market feels,
They're the ones pullin' the strings, makin' the calls,
Keepin' the economy stable, avoidin' the falls.
