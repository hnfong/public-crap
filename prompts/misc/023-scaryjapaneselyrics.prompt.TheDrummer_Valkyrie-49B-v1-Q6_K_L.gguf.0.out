Based on the lyrics, here's my interpretation of the story they tell:

The song appears to be about a mysterious, fantastical restaurant located deep in a forest that can only be found by those who have forgotten something. The restaurant has a distinctive red-tin roof and a unique menu featuring dishes like Carpaccio, Paella, Oubl√©, Risotto, and more. 

The restaurant is run by a mischievous staff, possibly supernatural beings, who play musical instruments like the violin, flute, cello, and viola. They welcome customers with a playful invitation to eat until they fall asleep.

The song takes a darker turn towards the end, suggesting that this is the customers' "last full course" and that the restaurant's service extends even to the grave. The final line about delivering to the grave implies that the restaurant's offerings may be the last meal before death.

Overall, the lyrics paint a picture of a surreal, otherworldly dining experience that blurs the lines between reality and fantasy. The restaurant seems to exist in a liminal space, accessible only to those who have forgotten something, and its true nature and intentions are left ambiguous and open to interpretation.
