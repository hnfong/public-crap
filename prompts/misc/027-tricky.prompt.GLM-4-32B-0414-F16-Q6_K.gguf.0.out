A) Yes, water freezes at -12 degrees Celsius. The freezing point of water is 0째C, so any temperature below that will cause water to freeze (assuming normal pressure conditions).

B) If a glass of pure water is cooled down to -12째C, it will freeze. The water molecules will lose enough kinetic energy to form a solid crystalline structure (ice). Note that pure water can sometimes supercool (remain liquid below 0째C) if there are no nucleation sites, but at -12째C it will almost certainly freeze. [end of text]
