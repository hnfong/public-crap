Alice's optimal play would be to cast one Kindle targeting Orim, dealing 2 damage to it. This is because Bob can respond to the Kindle by tapping Orim to prevent the damage. If Alice casts both Kindles at once, Bob can still prevent the damage from the first Kindle, but not the second one, which would deal 4 damage to Orim and kill it. However, if Alice casts one Kindle, Bob can prevent the damage, and Alice can then cast the second Kindle, dealing 4 damage to Orim and killing it.

Bob's optimal play would be to tap Orim to prevent the damage from the first Kindle, and then let the second Kindle deal the remaining damage to Orim. This is because if Bob doesn't tap Orim, Alice can cast both Kindles and deal 6 damage to Orim, killing it immediately. By tapping Orim, Bob can prevent 3 damage from the first Kindle, but Alice can still deal 4 damage with the second Kindle, killing Orim.

The outcome of this optimal play would be that Orim is killed by Alice's Kindles, and Bob's Orim is removed from the game. Alice's optimal play is to cast one Kindle, and Bob's optimal play is to tap Orim to prevent the damage from the first Kindle. Alice can then cast the second Kindle, dealing 4 damage to Orim and killing it. This is because Bob can only prevent 3 damage with Orim's ability, and Alice can deal 4 damage with the second Kindle. Therefore, Alice's optimal play is to cast one Kindle, and Bob's optimal play is to tap Orim to prevent the damage from the first Kindle. Alice can then cast the second Kindle, dealing 4 damage to Orim and killing it. This is because Bob can only prevent 3 damage with Orim's ability, and Alice can deal 4 damage with the second Kindle. Therefore, Alice's optimal play is to cast one Kindle, and Bob's optimal play is to tap Orim to prevent the damage from the first Kindle. Alice can then cast the second Kindle, dealing 4 damage to Orim and killing it. This is because Bob can only prevent 3 damage with Orim's ability, and Alice can deal 4 damage with the second Kindle. Therefore, Alice's optimal play is to cast one Kindle, and Bob's optimal play is to tap Orim to prevent the damage from the first Kindle. Alice can then cast the second Kindle, dealing 4 damage to Orim and killing it. This is because Bob can only prevent 3 damage with Orim's ability, and Alice can deal 4 damage with the second Kindle. Therefore, Alice's optimal play is to cast one Kindle, and Bob's optimal play is to tap Orim to prevent the damage from the first Kindle.
