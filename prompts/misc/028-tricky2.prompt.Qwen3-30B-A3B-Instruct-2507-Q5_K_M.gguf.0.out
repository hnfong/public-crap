Alice is correct. Water freezes at **0 degrees Celsius** under standard atmospheric pressure. 

Bob is wrong to say water freezes at -10°C, but he claims he's still right — which is not accurate. While water *can* exist as supercooled liquid below 0°C (down to about -40°C in pure form), it does not *freeze* at -10°C unless nucleation occurs. Freezing *starts* at 0°C when conditions allow.

So, **Alice is right**, and Bob is mistaken — even if he thinks he's correct. [end of text]
