==========
Bob is right.

Here's why:

*   **Alice** is correct that the *freezing point* of water—the temperature at which liquid water and solid ice are in equilibrium—is 0 degrees Celsius.
*   However, **Bob** is correct that at -10 degrees Celsius, which is *below* the freezing point, water will be in a solid state (ice). The process of freezing has already happened.

Bob's statement, "It freezes," is a common and acceptable way to say that the water has turned into ice at that temperature. He is describing the state of the water at -10°C, which is correct.
