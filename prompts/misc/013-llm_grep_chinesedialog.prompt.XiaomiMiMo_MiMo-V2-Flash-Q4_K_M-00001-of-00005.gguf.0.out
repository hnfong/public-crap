<think>First, the user wants me to perform a semantic "grep" based on the query: "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". I need to output only lines that match this description, along with their line numbers. If no lines match, I should give an empty response.

The input is provided, and I have to start from line 1. I should only trigger when the input obviously matches the query, not tangentially related.

Now, let's look at the input:

1:# 呆總嘅老豆

2:

3:

4:「轰隆！」」

5:

6:平静嘅夜空，竟然响起干雷。

7:

8:「啊～！」老夫同汉昭烈帝一样系盖世英雄，立即虎口剧震，筷子连同夹紧嗰嚿叉烧一齐跌咗落地。「⋯⋯吓死老夫喇。」

9:

10:我望住屋外天色，月光一早被黑云淹没，湿气极重。钦天监今次仲唔挂黑色暴雨警告的话，听朝睇怕会有十万人上书皇上，叫佢炒咗嗰班粉肠。

11:

12:「轰隆！」 呢次雷声，果然带来倾盘大雨，屋外屋顶雨声不绝。

13:

14:我喺呢间屋已经孤独度过十八个寒暑，屋顶落雨嘅滴嗒声每一個细节，一早了然于胸。

15:

16:

17:

18:

19:屋顶 ⋯⋯ 多咗一个人。

20:

21:我手握剑柄，六神归一，留心倾听。果然有人喺屋顶跳落后庭院！轻盈嘅脚步声极之细微，来者显然学过轻功。如果唔系忽然落大雨，敌人嘅突袭可能已经得手。

22:

23:脚步声越嚟越近，我腰间宝剑出鞘嘅一刻，厅门已经「嘭！」一声被踢爆。

24:

25:好在老夫力拔山河气盖世，虽然咁样斩法我把宝剑肯定见财化水，但刀剑相交嘅时候，我感觉到对方力气似乎比我大大不如。

26:

27:「哼，大胆狂徒，你系边个！点解要暗算老夫！」

28:

29:「你做咁多伤天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」听黑衣人嘅声音，竟然似系女人。难怪我同佢对打可以力拔山河。平时我边有咁大力？佢口里强硬，却一个翻身跳出墙外，似乎想逃走。

30:

31:

32:

33:我提剑急追，佢见我迫近，回身一剑，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一声，宝剑乱挥，斩中佢手腕。

34:

35:此时大雨已经停止，乌云渐散。月光之下见到黑衣人喺泥地上不断挣扎，却已经无力起身再战。黑衣人嘅脸相有点似曾相识，我再望返佢把剑，大吃一惊。咦！呢把咪系我以前嘅倚天剑？！

36:

37:呢把剑系当年党主席赐我嘅礼物，剑身刻有「HARRRR～！！！」嘅洋文，极为霸气。自从严癌之役之后，我就冇见过呢把剑，点解会重现人间呢？

38:

39:「你系咪严癌嘅人？！」我抑压心抵嘅震惊，若无其事咁问。

40:

41:「！！！」黑衣人惊骇嘅眼神已经回答咗我。佢点都估唔到我认得呢把剑。原来系严癌派人追杀我。

42:

43:我望住呢个嚟刺杀我嘅黑衣女人，定睛细看，确定咗我心底嘅疑惑之后，缓慢咁讲:

44:

45:

46:「阿呆，哎暗若饿花打。」

47:

48:「？？？」佢一脸迷罔，我忽然醒起严癌唔识英文。

49:

50:「我先唔系你老豆呀，哼哼。」

51:

52:【完】

I need to identify lines that contain dialog or spoken text. Dialog or spoken text typically includes text enclosed in quotation marks, like 「」 or other quotes, or lines where someone is speaking.

Let's go through each line:

- Line 1: "# 呆总嘅老豆" – This is a title or comment, not dialog. No quotes.

- Line 2: Empty – no text.

- Line 3: Empty – no text.

- Line 4: "「轰隆！」" – This is enclosed in quotes, so it's spoken text. It's a sound, but it's in quotes, so it should count.

- Line 5: Empty.

- Line 6: "平静嘅夜空，竟然响起干雷。" – This is narration, not dialog.

- Line 7: Empty.

- Line 8: "「啊～！」老夫同汉昭烈帝一样系盖世英雄，立即虎口剧震，筷子连同夹紧嗰嚿叉烧一齐跌咗落地。「⋯⋯吓死老夫喇。" – This contains two parts: first, "「啊～！」" which is spoken text, and then "「⋯⋯吓死老夫喇。" which is also spoken text. So this line has dialog.

- Line 9: Empty.

- Line 10: "我望住屋外天色，月光一早被黑云淹没，湿气极重。今次仲唔挂黑色暴雨警告的话，听朝睇怕会有十万人上书皇上，叫佢炒咗嗰班粉肠。" – This is narration, no quotes.

- Line 11: Empty.

- Line 12: "「轰隆！」 呢次雷声，果然带来倾盘大雨，屋外屋顶雨声不绝。" – This starts with "「轰隆！」" which is spoken text, so it should count.

- Line 13: Empty.

- Line 14: "我喺呢间屋已经孤独度过十八个寒暑，屋顶落雨嘅滴嗒声每一個细节，一早了然于胸。" – Narration, no quotes.

- Line 15: Empty.

- Line 16: Empty.

- Line 17: Empty.

- Line 18: Empty.

- Line 19: "屋顶 ⋯⋯ 多咗一个人。" – Narration, no quotes.

- Line 20: Empty.

- Line 21: "我手握剑柄，六神归一，留心倾听。果然有人喺屋顶跳落后庭院！轻盈嘅脚步声极之细微，来者显然学过轻功。如果唔系忽然落大雨，敌人的突袭可能已经得手。" – Narration, no quotes. The exclamation might be part of narration, but it's not in quotes.

- Line 22: Empty.

- Line 23: "脚步声越嚟越近，我腰间宝剑出鞘嘅一刻，厅门已经「嘭！」一声被踢爆。" – This contains "「嘭！」" which is spoken text or sound, so it should count.

- Line 24: Empty.

- Line 25: "好在老夫力拔山河气盖世，虽然咁样斩法我把宝剑肯定见财化水，但刀剑相交嘅时候，我感觉到对方力气似乎比我大大不如。" – Narration, no quotes.

- Line 26: Empty.

- Line 27: "「哼，大胆狂徒，你系边个！点解要暗算老夫！」" – This is entirely in quotes, so it's dialog.

- Line 28: Empty.

- Line 29: "「你做咁多伤天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」听黑衣人嘅声音，竟然似系女人。难怪我同佢对打可以力拔山河。平时我边有咁大力？佢口里强硬，却一个翻身跳出墙外，似乎想逃走。" – This starts with "「你做咁多伤天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」" which is spoken text, so it should count.

- Line 30: Empty.

- Line 31: Empty.

- Line 32: Empty.

- Line 33: "我提剑急追，佢见我迫近，回身一剑，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一声，宝剑乱挥，斩中佢手腕。" – This contains "「屌」" which is a spoken word, so it should count.

- Line 34: Empty.

- Line 35: "此时大雨已经停止，乌云渐散。月光之下见到黑衣人喺泥地上不断挣扎，却已经无力起身再战。黑衣人嘅脸相有点似曾相识，我再望返佢把剑，大吃一惊。咦！呢把咪系我以前嘅倚天剑？！" – This has "咦！" which might be an exclamation, but it's not in quotes. However, "系我以前嘅倚天剑？!" is part of narration. But "咦" is a spoken interjection. I need to decide if this obviously matches the query. The query is "lines that contain dialog or spoken text". "咦" is spoken text, but it's not in quotes. In the input, some spoken text is in quotes, some might not be. But in this line, "咦" is not in quotes, but it's a spoken expression. I should consider if it's obvious. Looking back, line 8 has "「⋯⋯吓死老夫喇。" which is in quotes, so for consistency, I might only trigger on text in quotes. But the query says "dialog or spoken text", so interjections like "咦" might count. However, the user said "only trigger when the input obviously matches the query", so I should be strict. Let's see the examples in the input: line 4, 8, 12, 23, 27, 29, 33 are all in quotes. Line 35 has "咦" without quotes, but it's a spoken sound. To be safe, I'll include it only if it's in quotes or clearly spoken text. But in line 35, "咦" is not in quotes, but "系我以前嘅倚天剑？!" is part of the narration. I think for semantic grep, we should include lines with obvious spoken text, even if not in quotes. But the user said "obviously matches", so I'll include line 35 because "咦" is a spoken interjection.

- Line 36: Empty.

- Line 37: "呢把剑系当年党主席赐我嘅礼物，剑身刻有「HARRRR～！！！」嘅洋文，极为霸气。自从严癌之役之后，我就冇见过呢把剑，点解会重现人间呢？" – This contains "「HARRRR～！！！」" which is spoken text or sound, so it should count.

- Line 38: Empty.

- Line 39: "「你系咪严癌嘅人？！」我抑压心抵嘅震惊，若无其事咁问。" – This starts with "「你系咪严癌嘅人？！」" which is spoken text.

- Line 40: Empty.

- Line 41: "「！！！」黑衣人惊骇嘅眼神已经回答咗我。佢点都估唔到我认得呢把剑。原来系严癌派人追杀我。" – This starts with "「！！！」" which is spoken text.

- Line 42: Empty.

- Line 43: "我望住呢个嚟刺杀我嘅定睛细看，确定咗我心底嘅疑惑之后，缓慢咁讲:" – This is narration, no quotes. But it says "缓慢咁讲", which indicates speech, but the speech is on the next lines.

- Line 44: Empty.

- Line 45: Empty.

- Line 46: "「阿呆，哎暗若饿花打。」" – This is in quotes, so spoken text.

- Line 47: Empty.

- Line 48: "「？？？」佢一脸迷罔，我忽然醒起严癌唔识英文。" – This starts with "「？？？」" which is spoken text.

- Line 49: Empty.

- Line 50: "「我先唔系你老豆呀，哼哼。」" – This is in quotes, spoken text.

- Line 51: Empty.

- Line 52: "【完】" – This is a marker, not dialog.

Now, I need to output only lines that match, with line numbers, and after each output, emit "---".

So, let's list the lines that contain dialog or spoken text:

- Line 4: "「轰隆！」"

- Line 8: "「啊～！」老夫同汉昭烈帝一样系盖世英雄，立即虎口剧震，筷子连同夹紧嗰嚿叉烧一齐跌咗落地。" "⋯⋯吓死老夫喇。" – but it's one line, so output the whole line.

- Line 12: "「轰隆！」 呢次雷声，果然带来倾盘大雨，屋外屋顶雨声不绝。"

- Line 23: "「嘭！」" in "厅门已经「嘭！」一声被踢爆。"

- Line 27: "「哼，大胆狂徒，你系边个！点解要暗算老夫！」"

- Line 29: "「你做咁多伤天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」" and the rest, but the spoken part is at the start.

- Line 33: "我「屌」一声，宝剑乱挥，斩中佢手腕。" – contains "「屌」"

- Line 35: "咦！呢把咪系我以前嘅倚天剑？!" – but "咦" is not in quotes. I think I should include it because it's spoken. But to be consistent, let's see if the user expects it. The query is "lines that contain dialog or spoken text", so interjections like "咦" should count. However, in the input, most spoken text is in quotes. But line 35 has "咦" which is clearly spoken. I'll include it.

- Line 37: "剑身刻有「HARRRR～！！！」嘅洋文" – so "「HARRRR～！！！」" is spoken text.

- Line 39: "「你系咪严癌嘅人？！」"

- Line 41: "「！！！」"

- Line 46: "「阿呆，哎暗若饿花打。」"

- Line 48: "「？？？」"

- Line 50: "「我先唔系你老豆呀，哼哼。」"

Now, line 43: "我望住呢个嚟刺杀我嘅定睛细看，确定咗我心底嘅疑惑之后，缓慢咁讲:" – this indicates speech, but the speech is on line 46, so line 43 itself doesn't contain spoken text. So I shouldn't output line 43.

Similarly, line 33: "我「屌」一声, so "屌" is spoken.

Line 35: "咦" is spoken.

But in line 35, it's "咦！呢把咪系我以前嘅倚天剑？!" – so "咦" is an interjection.

I think for semantic grep, we should output lines that have obvious spoken text, whether in quotes or not.

But the user said "only trigger when the input obviously matches the query", so I'll include lines with interjections like "咦" and "哼" etc.

Now, let's compile the list:

- Line 4: "「轰隆！」"

- Line 8: "「啊～！」老夫同汉昭烈帝一样系盖世英雄，立即虎口剧震，筷子连同夹紧嗰嚿叉烧一齐跌咗落地。" "⋯⋯吓死老夫喇。" – but it's one line, so output the whole line.

- Line 12: "「轰隆！」 呢次雷声，果然带来倾盘大雨，屋外屋顶雨声不绝。"

- Line 23: "厅门已经「嘭！」一声被踢爆。" – contains "「嘭！」"

- Line 27: "「哼，大胆狂徒，你系边个！点解要暗算老夫！」"

- Line 29: "「你做咁多伤天害理嘅事，今日我要替天行道！」听黑衣人嘅声音，竟然似系女人。难怪我同佢对打可以力拔山河。平时我边有咁大力？佢口里强硬，却一个翻身跳出墙外，似乎想逃走。" – output the whole line since it starts with spoken text.

- Line 33: "我提剑急追，佢见我迫近，回身一剑，刺中我右肩。我「屌」一声，宝剑乱挥，斩中佢手腕。" – contains "「屌」"

- Line 35: "此时大雨已经停止，乌云渐散。月光之下见到黑衣人喺泥地上不断挣扎，却已经无力起身再战。黑衣人嘅脸相有点似曾相识，我再望返佢把剑，大吃一惊。咦！呢把咪系我以前嘅倚天剑？!" – contains "咦" which is spoken.

- Line 37: "呢把剑系当年党主席赐我嘅礼物，剑身刻有「HARRRR～！！！」嘅洋文，极为霸气。自从严癌之役之后，我就冇见过呢把剑，点解会重现人间呢？" – contains "「HARRRR～！！！」"

- Line 39: "「你
