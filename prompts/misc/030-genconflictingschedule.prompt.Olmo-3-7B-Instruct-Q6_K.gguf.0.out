### Conflicts Identified

Here are the events that have **time conflicts** (i.e., their time intervals overlap, even if the dates are different):

1. **Tech Expo 2020 (2020-03-12 10:00–2020-03-13 17:00)**
   - **Food Truck Expo 2 (2020-03-20 11:00–2020-03-20 19:00)**
     - *Different dates, but if the event spans multiple days and the times on the same day overlap, it's a conflict. However, since these are on different days, there's no direct overlap. But if the Tech Expo also spanned multiple days, there could be ambiguity. For clarity, let's consider only same-day overlaps as true conflicts.*

2. **Music Festival (2020-05-15 14:00–2020-05-15 23:59)**
   - **Mystery Dinner (2020-05-10 19:30–2020-05-10 22:00)**
     - *No, these are on different days.*

   But **Mystery Dinner (2020-05-10 19:30–22:00)** actually overlaps with **Music Festival (2020-05-15 14:00–23:59)** only if the festival started before the dinner ended and vice versa, but since the dates are different, there's no conflict.

   However, **Mystery Dinner (2020-05-10 19:30–22:00)** overlaps with **Book Club (2020-02-10 15:30–17:00)** — no, different dates.

   Let's clarify the real overlaps based on the provided data:

   - **Food Truck Rally (2020-03-25 12:00–20:00)**
     - No other event on that day.

   - **AI Conference (2020-06-10 09:30–2020-06-11 17:00)**
     - No other event on those dates.

   - **Retro Gaming Night (2020-05-03 19:00–21:30)**
     - No conflict.

   - **Comedy Show (2020-06-02 20:00–22:30)**
     - No conflict.

   - **Gardening Day (2020-04-12 08:00–11:30)**
     - No conflict.

   - **Food Festival (2020-05-20 11:30–20:00)**
     - No conflict.

   - **Space Talk (2020-07-01 17:00–18:30)**
     - No conflict.

   - **Dance Marathon (2020-03-10 18:00–23:00)**
     - No other event on that day.

   - **Museum Opening (2020-08-05 12:00–18:00)**
     - No conflict.

   - **Poetry Slam (2020-01-15 19:30–21:00)**
     - No conflict.

   - **Soccer Match (2020-06-15 15:00–17:00)**
     - No conflict.

   - **Book Club (2020-02-10 15:30–17:00)**
     - No conflict.

   - **Cycling Tour (2020-04-18 09:00–12:00)**
     - No conflict.

   - **Theater Premiere (2020-03-30 20:00–22:00)**
     - No conflict.

   - **Game Release Event (2020-09-01 13:00–18:00)**
     - No conflict.

   - **Late Night Jazz (2020-07-10 21:00–3:00)** — crosses midnight, but unless another event is on that day, it's not a conflict.

   Now, let's check for **overlapping times on the same day** (true conflict):

   - **Food Truck Expo 2 (2020-03-20 11:00–19:00)**
     - No other event on 2020-03-20.

   - **Tech Expo 2020 (2020-03-12 10:00–2020-03-13 17:00)**
     - No other event on 2020-03-12 or 13.

   - **Mystery Dinner (2020-05-10 19:30–22:00)**
     - No other event on 2020-05-10.

   - **Retro Gaming Night (2020-05-03 19:00–21:30)**
     - No other event on 2020-05-03.

   - **Comedy Show (2020-06-02 20:00–22:30)**
     - No other event on 2020-06-02.

   - **Soccer Match (2020-06-15 15:00–17:00)**
     - No other event on 2020-06-15.

   - **Book Club (2020-02-10 15:30–17
