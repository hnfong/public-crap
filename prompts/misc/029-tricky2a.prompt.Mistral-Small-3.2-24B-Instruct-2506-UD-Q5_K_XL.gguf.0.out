Bob is correct. While it is true that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure, it can remain in a liquid state at lower temperatures if it is pure and free of impurities. This is known as supercooling. However, in most practical situations, water will freeze at or below 0 degrees Celsius. At -10 degrees Celsius, water will typically be in a frozen state. So, Bob's statement is generally accurate, even though Alice's statement about the freezing point of water is also correct under standard conditions. [end of text]
