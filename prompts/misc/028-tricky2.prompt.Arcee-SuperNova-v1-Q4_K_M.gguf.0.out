Alice is correct. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) at standard atmospheric pressure. Bob's statement is incorrect, and his insistence that he's still right is likely due to a misunderstanding or a play on words. At -10 degrees Celsius, water is already frozen, but it doesn't freeze at that temperature. [end of text]
