Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.
Both Alice and Bob are correct, but they are referring to different scenarios.

Alice is correct in stating that pure water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm).

Bob is also correct because, in certain conditions, water can freeze at temperatures lower than 0 degrees Celsius. For example, if the water is supercooled (cooled below its freezing point without forming ice), it can remain liquid until it reaches a temperature of -10 degrees Celsius or lower, at which point it will freeze. Additionally, the presence of impurities or changes in pressure can alter the freezing point of water.

So, both are right in their respective contexts. [end of text]
