Alright, buckle up! Here's a place in original Vanilla WoW lore for every letter of the alphabet, sticking strictly to the content available in the 2004-2007 era (no expansions). This is tricky for some letters, so I'll explain choices where needed.  I'll also note the continent/zone for clarity.

**Important Note:** Some letters are *very* difficult. I'm prioritizing places mentioned in quests, lore books, or significant to the world, even if not a directly visitable zone.  Some are stretches, but I'll explain.

---

**A - Azeroth** (Eastern Kingdoms/Kalimdor) - The entire planet! The foundation of everything.
**B - Blackrock Depths** (Eastern Kingdoms - Blackrock Mountains) - A massive, iconic dungeon complex.
**C - Crossroads** (Kalimdor - Barrens) - The central Horde hub in the Barrens.
**D - Darkshore** (Kalimdor) - Night Elf homeland, site of significant conflict.
**E - Elwynn Forest** (Eastern Kingdoms) - Classic Alliance starting zone.
**F - Feralas** (Kalimdor) - Home to the furbolgs and the Emerald Dreamway.
**G - Gnomeregan** (Eastern Kingdoms - Dun Morogh) - The ruined gnomish city, a key part of their lore.
**H - Hinterlands** (Eastern Kingdoms) - Alliance zone with the wildhammer dwarves.
**I - Ironforge** (Eastern Kingdoms - Dun Morogh) - The grand dwarven city.
**J - Jungle Stranglethorn** (Kalimdor - Stranglethorn Vale) - A notorious PvP zone and home to trolls.
**K - Karazhan** (Eastern Kingdoms - Deadwind Pass) - The mysterious tower of Medivh, though inaccessible until later patches, it was established in lore.
**L - Loch Modan** (Eastern Kingdoms) - Alliance zone with the dwarves and gnomes.
**M - Maraudon** (Kalimdor - Desolace) - A massive, multi-level dungeon with centaur and dragonkin.
**N - Northrend** (Continent - Mentioned in Lore) - While not playable in Vanilla, Northrend was *heavily* referenced in quests, books (like the Explorer's League), and the Lich King's backstory. It's a crucial lore location.
**O - Orgrimmar** (Kalimdor - Durotar) - The Horde capital city.
**P - Plaguelands** (Eastern Kingdoms) - The Scourge-infested zones of Lordaeron.
**Q - Quel'Thalas** (Eastern Kingdoms) - The homeland of the high elves (later blood elves).
**R - Redridge Mountains** (Eastern Kingdoms) - Alliance zone with the Stonewarden dwarves.
**S - Scholomance** (Eastern Kingdoms - Western Plaguelands) - A dungeon filled with undead and arcane experiments.
**T - Tanaris** (Kalimdor) - Desert zone with Gadgetzan and the Steamwheeper Quarter.
**U - Undercity** (Eastern Kingdoms - Tirisfal Glades) - The Forsaken capital city.
**V - Vashj'ir** (Continent - Mentioned in Lore) - Like Northrend, Vashj'ir was referenced in lore (especially related to the Naga) but not playable. It's a key part of the world's geography.
**W - Westfall** (Eastern Kingdoms) - Alliance zone plagued by bandits and the Defias Brotherhood.
**X - Xor's Fortress** (Kalimdor - Burning Steppes) - A dungeon in the Burning Steppes.
**Y - Ysondre's Grove** (Kalimdor - Feralas) - A location within Feralas, sacred to the Emerald Dream.
**Z - Zul'Farrak** (Kalimdor - Tanaris) - A troll dungeon in the desert.

**Notes & Explanations:**

*   **N & V:** These were the hardest. Northrend and Vashj'ir are included because they were *essential* to the world's lore and the Lich King's story, even though not playable zones. Their existence was fundamental to the narrative.
*   **Karazhan:** While the raid wasn't available until later patches, the tower and its lore were established in the original game.
*   **Emphasis on Lore:** I prioritized places that were significant to the world's history, quests, or factions, even if they weren't major zones.
*   **Vanilla Definition:** I'm sticking to the 1.12.1 patch content.

This was a fun challenge! It highlights how rich the original WoW world was, even without expansions.  Let me know if you'd like any of these explained in more detail. [end of text]
