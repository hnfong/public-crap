A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?
- No, water typically freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under standard atmospheric pressure. At -12 degrees Celsius, water is well below its freezing point and should be in a frozen state.

B) I have a glass of pure water. What happens if it is cooled down to -12 degrees Celsius?
- If you cool pure water to -12 degrees Celsius, it should be frozen solid. However, under certain conditions, pure water can remain in a supercooled liquid state below 0 degrees Celsius. Supercooled water is metastable and can rapidly freeze if disturbed or if a nucleation site (such as a speck of dust) is introduced. In most practical scenarios, though, the water will freeze and form ice at -12 degrees Celsius. [end of text]
