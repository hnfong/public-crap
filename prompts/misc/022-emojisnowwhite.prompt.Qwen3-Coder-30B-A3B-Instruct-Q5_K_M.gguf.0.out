👸✨❄️

Once upon a time, there lived a princess with hair as black as midnight and skin as white as snow. Her stepmother was a wicked queen who owned a magic mirror that could speak.

🪞👑

"Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?" she would ask each morning.

The mirror would always reply, "You are, dear queen, the fairest of them all."

But one day, the mirror said something different:

"Snow White is fairer than you, dear queen."

The queen's heart turned cold with jealousy. She ordered her huntsman to take Snow White into the forest and kill her.

🏹🌲

The huntsman couldn't bear to kill the innocent girl, so he let her escape. Snow White ran deeper into the forest until she found a small cottage.

🏠🐭

Inside, she discovered seven tiny dwarfs who were very kind to her. She helped them with chores and they helped her. The queen, using her magic, found Snow White and disguised herself as an old woman.

👩‍🦳🍎

She offered Snow White a poisoned apple, which she accepted. Snow White fell into a deep sleep, like a death.

The dwarfs were heartbroken. They placed her in a glass coffin and mourned her.

🤴❤️

A handsome prince came by and fell in love with her. He kissed her, and she woke up, alive and well.

👸💍

They married and lived happily ever after. The wicked queen was punished for her evil deeds.
