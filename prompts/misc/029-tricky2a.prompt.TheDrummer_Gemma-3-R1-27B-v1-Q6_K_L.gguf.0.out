Bob is right, despite Alice's correction. 

While water *typically* freezes at 0°C, at -10°C **water is definitely frozen (ice)**. Bob stated the *state* of water at that temperature, which is correct. Alice focused on the *transition point* (freezing point), which is a different aspect of the question.

Bob's answer describes what *happens* to water at -10°C – it exists as a solid (ice). Alice is correcting a misconception about *when* freezing starts, not what the water *is* at that temperature.
