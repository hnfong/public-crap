Here's a story about the three little pigs:

Once upon a time, in a village far, far away, there lived three little pigs. They were very happy and content, living in a cozy little house with their mother and father.

One day, the three little pigs decided to build a big house for themselves. They used all their piggy banks and savings to buy the materials they needed. They even built a big fire to keep warm.

As they worked on their house, they noticed that the house was not quite as big as they had hoped. They decided to add more rooms to make it even bigger.

But as they worked, they realized that they had forgotten to add a little bit of wood to the fire. The fire was too hot and the wood was too hot, and it started to burn.

The three little pigs were very sad and frustrated. They tried to fix the fire, but it was too late. The fire was already on fire, and the three little pigs were trapped inside.

They tried to escape, but the fire was too strong. They tried to run, but the fire was too strong. They tried to hide, but the fire was too strong.

Finally, they realized that they had no choice but to leave the house and go to the big house outside. They were very sad and disappointed, but they knew that they had made the right decision.

The three little pigs went to the big house outside, and they were very happy and content. They had learned a valuable lesson about the importance of being kind and helpful to others, and they knew that they would always be grateful for the three little pigs. [end of text]
