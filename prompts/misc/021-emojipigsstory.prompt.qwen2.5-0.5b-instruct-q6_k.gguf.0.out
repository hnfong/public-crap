Okay, let's get started!

Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived three little pigs. They were very happy and content, living a peaceful life in the woods.

One day, the three little pigs decided to build a house together. They used their sticks and branches to build a sturdy frame, and then they used their wood to build the walls.

The three little pigs worked hard and finished their house in just a few days. They were so proud of their hard work that they decided to share their house with the rest of the village.

The villagers were amazed by the three little pigs' hard work and their happy lives. They invited the three little pigs to their home, and they lived happily ever after.

And so, the three little pigs lived happily ever after, building their house and sharing it with the rest of the village. [end of text]
