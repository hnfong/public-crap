In this scenario, Alice wants to kill Bob's Orim, Samite Healer using her two copies of 'Kindle'. Let's break down the optimal play for both players step-by-step.

### Alice's Optimal Play

1. **Cast the First Kindle**:
   - Alice casts the first Kindle, targeting Orim.
   - The damage dealt by Kindle is calculated as \( X = 2 + \text{number of Kindle cards in all graveyards} \).
   - Since there are no Kindle cards in any graveyard yet, \( X = 2 \).
   - Alice deals 2 damage to Orim.

2. **Bob's Response**:
   - Bob taps Orim to prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.
   - Since Orim is tapped, it cannot prevent the 2 damage from the first Kindle.

3. **Cast the Second Kindle**:
   - Alice casts the second Kindle, again targeting Orim.
   - Now, there is 1 Kindle in the graveyard, so \( X = 2 + 1 = 3 \).
   - Alice deals 3 damage to Orim.

4. **Bob's Response**:
   - Orim is already tapped from preventing the previous damage, so it cannot prevent the 3 damage from the second Kindle.
   - Orim has 1 toughness, so the 3 damage from the second Kindle destroys Orim.

### Outcome

- **Orim, Samite Healer** is destroyed.
- Alice successfully removes the threat to her burn deck.

### Thought Process

- **Alice's Thought Process**:
  - Alice needs to deal at least 3 damage to Orim to destroy it.
  - She has two Kindle spells, and each Kindle's damage increases based on the number of Kindle cards in graveyards.
  - By casting the first Kindle, she deals 2 damage and puts a Kindle in the graveyard.
  - By casting the second Kindle, she deals 3 damage, which is enough to destroy Orim.

- **Bob's Thought Process**:
  - Bob needs to prevent at least 3 damage to save Orim.
  - He can tap Orim to prevent the next 3 damage, but he can only do this once per turn.
  - Since Orim is tapped after preventing the first 3 damage, it cannot prevent the second 3 damage.

### Game Mechanics

- **Kindle**: An instant that deals \( X \) damage, where \( X \) is 2 plus the number of Kindle cards in all graveyards.
- **Orim, Samite Healer**: A legendary creature with 1/3 toughness and the ability to tap to prevent the next 3 damage dealt to any target this turn.
- **Tapping**: A creature can only tap once per turn unless specified otherwise.

By following this sequence, Alice optimally removes Orim from the board, and Bob's attempt to prevent the damage is thwarted by the timing and mechanics of the spells involved. [end of text]
