Yo, listen up, I’m spittin’ the truth,  
The Fed’s the big boss, the money’s in their hands.  
They don’t print cash, but they control the flow,  
Keep the economy from crashin’ like a low.  

They’re like the DJ, spin the money’s beat,  
Raise or lower rates, that’s their beat.  
If the market’s hot, they cool it down,  
If it’s chill, they pump it up, no doubt.  

They watch the banks, make sure they don’t go rogue,  
Keep inflation from blowin’ up like a balloon.  
They’re the OGs, the ones who set the tone,  
Keep the whole world from goin’ broke, no need to groan.  

So next time you drop a track, think about the Fed,  
They’re the ones who keep the money flowin’ like a jet.  
No cap, they’re the real deal, the OGs of the game,  
Keep the economy tight, no need to complain. [end of text]
