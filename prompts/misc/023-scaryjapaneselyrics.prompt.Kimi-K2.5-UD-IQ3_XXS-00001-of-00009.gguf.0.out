This is a delightful and macabre piece. Here's my interpretation:

## The Literal Story

This is a **restaurant for the dead** — or more precisely, a restaurant *run by* the dead *for* the dead, hidden deep in a forest that cannot be reached by the living.

**The journey there:** You arrive by "following acorns" (a classic symbol of the afterlife in Japanese folklore, associated with the other world) and by "following forgotten people" — meaning you only find this place when you've been forgotten by the living world. The empty pockets suggest you bring nothing material from your previous life.

**The restaurant itself:** A small, whimsical place with a red tin roof, perpetually empty of reservations yet somehow full of "commotion" (おおわらわ). The menu only has "chef's recommendations" because the dead have no preferences left — or perhaps because the chef serves whatever he pleases. The kitchen orchestra (violin, flute, cello, viola) suggests ghostly musicians.

**The service:** "Eat your fill, then sleep" — the eternal sleep of death. The "last full course" delivered "even to the grave" confirms this is a final meal for the departed. The bear cub dancing on guests' hands and the birds laughing create a playful, almost *yōkai*-like atmosphere of spirits who've made peace with their condition.

**The ending:** "Right to left, great commotion" evokes the Buddhist custom of placing the dead with head to the north, or perhaps the chaotic joy of a last supper before oblivion — "tomorrow is tomorrow, et cetera," a dismissal of all future concerns.

## The Tone

The genius is the **cheerful nihilism**. It's not sad to be dead here — it's a party. The restaurant is *small* and *hidden*, suggesting intimacy rather than grandeur. The dead don't want grandeur. They want a simple, endless lunch with music, where dessert is wisely omitted (what need have the dead for sweetness?) and the bear cub dances.

It's *Restaurant to Another World* meets *Obon* meets Edward Gorey. [end of text]
