Got it, let's try to figure this out. The question is about whether Bob is right when he says water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius, even though Alice corrects him by saying water freezes at 0 degrees. First, I need to remember the basics of water freezing. 

Under standard atmospheric pressure (which is 1 atmosphere, about 101.3 kPa), the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius. That's the normal freezing point. But maybe Bob is thinking about pressure changes? Because the freezing point of a substance can depend on pressure. For most substances, increasing pressure raises the freezing point, but water is unusual—it expands when it freezes, so increasing pressure actually lowers the freezing point. Wait, is that right? Let me confirm: water has a negative coefficient of thermal expansion between 0 and 4 degrees Celsius, meaning it's less dense as a solid than as a liquid. So according to phase diagrams, for water, the freezing point (the temperature at which solid and liquid are in equilibrium) decreases as pressure increases above 1 atm? Wait no, actually, let's look at the phase diagram of water. The solid-liquid equilibrium line (the freezing point curve) has a negative slope. That means if you increase pressure, the freezing point goes down, and if you decrease pressure, the freezing point goes up. 

At standard pressure (1 atm), it's 0°C. But if the pressure is lower than 1 atm, does the freezing point increase or decrease? Wait, let's think: at the top of a mountain, pressure is lower. Does water freeze easier there? I think the freezing point of water actually decreases slightly with decreasing pressure, but wait, no—wait, when pressure is lower, the molecules don't need as much energy to escape the liquid, but for freezing, it's about the balance between liquid and solid. Since ice is less dense, lower pressure would make it easier for water to turn into ice? Or harder? Let me get this straight. The phase diagram: the line between ice and liquid water goes from the triple point (0.01°C, 611.657 Pa) upwards to the left. So at pressures below the triple point, water can't exist as a liquid; it goes directly from solid to gas (sublimation) or vice versa. Above the triple point, as pressure increases, the freezing point decreases. Wait, the triple point is the only point where all three phases coexist. At 1 atm (which is much higher than the triple point pressure), the freezing point is 0°C. If we go to higher pressure than 1 atm, say 2 atm, what's the freezing point? Let me check: actually, the slope of the ice-water line is about -3.9 degrees Celsius per 100 atm. So increasing pressure by 100 atm lowers the freezing point by about 3.9°C. So at very high pressure, water can stay liquid below 0°C. For example, under high pressure, you can have liquid water at -10°C? Wait, but does that mean it freezes at -10°C under some pressure?

Wait, the question is Bob says "It freezes" when Alice asks about -10°C. Alice says no, it freezes at 0°C. Bob says he's still right. So maybe Bob is correct in the sense that under certain conditions (not standard pressure), water can freeze at -10°C. Because the freezing point isn't fixed at 0°C only; it depends on pressure. So "freezes at 0°C" is the standard condition, but if pressure is different, the freezing point changes. Since water's freezing point decreases with increasing pressure, there exists some pressure where the freezing point is -10°C. Therefore, at that pressure, water would freeze at -10°C. So Bob is right in that context—he's not necessarily wrong just because the standard freezing point is 0°C; he's pointing out that the freezing point isn't absolute, it depends on pressure, so water can freeze at -10°C under the right pressure conditions.

Is there another angle? Maybe supercooling? Supercooling is when water is cooled below 0°C but still remains liquid, not frozen, even at standard pressure. But supercooled water is not yet frozen; it can freeze spontaneously, but the freezing point is still considered 0°C, it's just metastable. So supercooling doesn't mean the freezing point is -10°C, it's just that it hasn't frozen yet. So that's different. The actual freezing point (equilibrium) at standard pressure is 0°C. But if you change pressure, the equilibrium freezing point changes. So if you have high enough pressure, the equilibrium freezing point is -10°C, so at that pressure, water freezes at -10°C. Therefore, Bob is correct because he's referring to non-standard pressure conditions, whereas Alice is stating the standard freezing point. So both are partially right, but Bob is still right in the sense that water can freeze at -10°C under certain pressures.</seed:think>Bob is technically correct, but Alice is referring to the **standard condition** while Bob is accounting for variable pressure.  


### Key Explanation:  
The freezing point of water is not fixed at 0°C absolutely—it depends on **pressure**. Under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), water freezes at 0°C (Alice’s point). However, water is unique: it expands when freezing, so increasing pressure *lowers* its freezing point (per its phase diagram). For example, at sufficiently high pressure, the equilibrium freezing point of water can drop below 0°C, even to -10°C.  

Thus, Bob is right: water **can** freeze at -10°C if the pressure is high enough (not just standard pressure). Alice correctly states the *standard* freezing point, but Bob’s claim about -10°C holds under non-standard conditions.  


**Answer:** Bob is right because the freezing point of water depends on pressure; at high enough pressure, water freezes below 0°C (e.g., -10°C). Alice refers to the standard atmospheric pressure freezing point, but Bob accounts for variable pressure. [end of text]
