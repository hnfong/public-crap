Alright, I need to figure out how to perform this semantic grep task based on the given input and query. Let's break it down step by step.

The user provided an input which is a series of lines with line numbers and content. The query is "all lines with comments", and I need to output each line (with line number) only if it has something that matches, specifically lines with comments. Also, ignore lines that don't obviously match tangentially. Only trigger when obviously matches.

The query is "all lines with comments", so I need to find lines that contain comments.

Looking at the input provided:

The input starts with line 1:#!/bin/bash
Line 2: set -ex
Line 3: empty
Line 4: # Save the path to ./download_check script
Line 5: script_path=... etc.
Line 6: download_check_path=...
Line 7: empty
Line 8: function...
Line 9: set -e
Line 10: curl -C - -O -L ...
And so on.

The query is to find lines with comments. So I need to check each line to see if it contains any comment.

Let me process each line:

Line 1:#!/bin/bash – Probably has comments? It starts with #, so yes. So line 1 should be output.

Line 2: set -ex – No comments, just a command. So not.

Line 3: empty – No content, so no.

Line 4: # Save ... – Starts with #, so has comments.

Line 5: script_path=... – No comments.

Line 6: download_check_path=... – No comments.

Line 7: empty.

Line 8: function... – No comments.

Line 9: set -e – No comments.

Line 10: curl ... – No comments.

Line 11: local my_filename=... – No comments.

Line 12: $download_check_path ... – No comments.

Line 13: function... – No comments.

Line 14: ... function... – No comments.

Line 15: script to build tmux – No comments.

Line 16: prefix=... – No comments.

Line 17: mkdir ... – No comments.

Line 18: cd ... – No comments.

Line 19: download_and_check ... – No comments.

Line 20: download_and_check ... – Has comments? Let me check line 20: "download_and_check 'https://...'" So yes, it has a command line with comments.

So line 20 should be included.

Line 21: tar zxvf ... – No comments.

Line 22: cd ... – No comments.

Line 23: make install – No comments.

Line 24: make install install – No comments.

Line 25: ... etc.

Line 29: comment line with comments.

Line 30: download_and_check ... – Yes.

Line 31: tar zxvf ...

Line 32: cd ... – No comments.

Line 33: ./configure ... – No comments.

Line 34: make install – Yes.

Line 35: make install ...

Line 36: cd ...

Line 37: comment line.

Line 38: download_and_check ... – Yes.

Line 39: tar zxvf ...

Line 40: cd ... – No comments.

Line 41: ./configure ... – No comments.

Line 42: make install – Yes.

Line 43: make install ...

Line 44: cd ...

Line 45: comment line.

Line 46: download_and_check ... – Yes.

Line 47: tar zxvf ...

Line 48: cd ... – No comments.

Line 49: download_and_check ... – Yes.

Line 50: tar zxvf ...

Line 51: cd ... – No comments.

Line 52: make prefix="$prefix" – Yes.

Line 53: make install prefix="$prefix" – Yes.

Line 54: cd .. – No comments.

Line 55: comment line.

Line 56: download_and_check ... – Yes.

Line 57: tar zxvf ...

Line 58: cd tmux-3.5a – No comments.

Line 59: KG_CONFIG="$prefix"/bin/pkg-config ... – No comments.

Line 60: make -j 10 – No comments.

Line 61: make install – Yes.

Line 62: make install ... – Yes.

Line 63: cd .. – No comments.

Line 64: comment line.

Line 65: ln -sf ... – No comments.

Now, the query is "all lines with comments". So lines that have at least one comment.

So I need to check each line for presence of any comment. A line has comments if it contains any # or % or other comment indicators.
