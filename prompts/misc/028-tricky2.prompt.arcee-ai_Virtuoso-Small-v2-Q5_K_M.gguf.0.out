Alice is right. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, not -10 degrees Celsius. At -10 degrees Celsius, water remains in its liquid state, although it is very cold. Bob's statement is incorrect because he misstated the freezing point of water. However, Bob's final statement that he is still right is also incorrect, as his initial claim about the freezing point of water is factually wrong. Therefore, Alice is correct in both her statement about the freezing point of water and in disagreeing with Bob's incorrect claim. [end of text]
