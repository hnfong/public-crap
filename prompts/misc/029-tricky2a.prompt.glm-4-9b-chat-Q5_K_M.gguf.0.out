Bob is technically correct in the context of pure water at standard atmospheric pressure. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius (32 degrees Fahrenheit) under normal conditions. However, Bob's statement that "it freezes" at -10 degrees Celsius is not entirely accurate because water at -10 degrees Celsius is not in its liquid state; it is in a solid state, which is ice.

The confusion might arise from the fact that water can exist in a solid state at temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius, but this is due to the process of supercooling, where water remains in a liquid state below its freezing point until a nucleation point is introduced (like a seed or a scratch on a surface) that causes it to freeze.

In summary, Alice is correct about the standard freezing point of water, but Bob's statement is also true in the sense that water at -10 degrees Celsius is in a frozen state, just not in the liquid form that we typically associate with water at that temperature. [end of text]
