Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "It freezes."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.

Assistant: "Both Alice and Bob are correct in their statements. Water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius, which is the standard freezing point under standard atmospheric pressure. However, Bob's statement is also correct in a broader sense. Water can freeze at temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius, but it requires a process called supercooling. Supercooling occurs when water is cooled below its freezing point without forming ice. This can happen if the water is very pure or if it is disturbed (like by adding a seed crystal). So, in a way, Bob is also correct because water can freeze at -10 degrees Celsius if it is supercooled."<|im_end|>
