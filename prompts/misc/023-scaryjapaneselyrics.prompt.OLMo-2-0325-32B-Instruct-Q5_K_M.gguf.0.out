The lyrics tell a whimsical story set in a fantastical forest, where the protagonist finds a small, empty restaurant. Despite searching for it (perhaps guided by the sound of a donguri, or acorn, rolling), they cannot seem to reach it. The restaurant, nestled in the woods, has empty pockets and no reservations, yet it is lunchtime and the birds are chirping with laughter.

The literal interpretation in this fantastical setting is that the protagonist stumbles upon a peculiar, seemingly abandoned forest eatery. The roof of this restaurant is made of bright red paint and tin, and the menu only features recommendations, suggesting a limited but special selection. From the kitchen, one can hear the sounds of a violin, flute, cello, and viola, indicating a lively and musical atmosphere behind the scenes.

The restaurant welcomes guests with an invitation to eat their special dish, which is so delicious that it makes one sleepy. After dining, the guests are bid farewell with a promise that they can return again tomorrow, though the phrase "et cetera" suggests a playful, nonchalant attitude towards time and routine.

As the story progresses, even a small bear cub, presumably a guest or a resident of the forest, begins to dance to the music. The mention of characters like "Karpaccho," "Parelia," and "Oodoburu" (which seem like playful, made-up names or perhaps references to other fantastical beings or dishes) adds to the whimsical atmosphere. The restaurant offers a variety of dishes, but notably, there are no calzones or desserts.

The climax of the story is the announcement of a final, full-course meal for the evening, suggesting a special event or a farewell dinner. The line "お墓の中まで届けましょう" (we'll deliver it even to your grave) could be interpreted as a humorous exaggeration of the restaurant's dedication to service, or perhaps a playful reference to the legendary quality of the meal that it's almost otherworldly.

In summary, the story is about a magical, musical forest restaurant that, despite its empty appearance and lack of reservations, offers a unique and delightful dining experience. The restaurant is a place where even the forest creatures gather, and the food is so special that it's said to induce sleep and is promised to be delivered anywhere, even beyond the realm of the living. The fantastical elements suggest a place where the ordinary rules of the world do not apply, and the restaurant becomes a symbol of joy, music, and the unexpected pleasures of life (or afterlife).
