Sure! Hereâ€™s a list of places in World of Warcraft lore, one for each letter of the alphabet, based on the original vanilla WoW:

A for Azeroth  
B for Booty Bay  
C for Crossroads  
D for Darkshore  
E for Elwynn Forest  
F for Felwood  
G for Gnomeregan  
H for Hillsbrad Foothills  
I for Ironforge  
J for Jade Forest (Note: This is a bit of a stretch, as Jade Forest is from Mists of Pandaria. A more fitting choice might be "J for The Deadmines" in Westfall.)  
K for Kalimdor  
L for Loch Modan  
M for Mulgore  
N for Northern Stranglethorn  
O for Orgrimmar  
P for Plaguelands  
Q for Quel'Thalas (Note: While not directly accessible in vanilla WoW, it is a significant location in lore.)  
R for Redridge Mountains  
S for Stormwind  
T for Tanaris  
U for Undercity  
V for Valley of Strength (in Orgrimmar)  
W for Winterspring  
X for Xavian (Note: This is a bit of a stretch, as Xavian is not a well-known location. A more fitting choice might be "X for The Exodar" which is from The Burning Crusade, but for vanilla, "X for The Barrens" could work as a general area.)  
Y for Ysera's Rest (Note: This is a bit of a stretch, as Ysera's Rest is not a specific location in vanilla WoW. A more fitting choice might be "Y for Ymiron's Grave" in the Eastern Plaguelands.)  
Z for Zul'Gurub

I hope this helps! Let me know if you need any adjustments or more details. [end of text]
