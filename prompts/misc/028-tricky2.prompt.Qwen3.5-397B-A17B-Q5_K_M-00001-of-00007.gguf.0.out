**Alice is right** about the scientific fact, but **Bob is right** about the logical outcome.

Here's the breakdown:
*   **Alice** is correct that the freezing *point* of water is **0°C**. This is the temperature at which the phase change begins.
*   **Bob** is correct that at **-10°C**, water **is frozen**. Since -10°C is below the freezing point, any liquid water exposed to that temperature will have already turned into ice.

So, while Alice correctly identified the threshold, Bob correctly described the state of the water at that specific temperature. [end of text]
