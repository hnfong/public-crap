Thinking Process:

1.  **Analyze the Request:**
    *   Input: A dialogue between Alice and Bob about water freezing at -10 degrees Celsius.
    *   Task: Determine who is right and explain briefly.
    *   Constraint: `/nothink` (This means I should not output my internal thought process, just the final answer).

2.  **Analyze the Dialogue:**
    *   Alice asks: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
    *   Bob answers: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
    *   Alice corrects: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
    *   Bob insists: "Yes, but I'm still right."

3.  **Evaluate the Science:**
    *   Freezing point of water: 0°C (at standard atmospheric pressure).
    *   State of water at -10°C: Solid (ice).
    *   Bob's statement: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius." This is technically ambiguous.
        *   Interpretation 1: The *process* of freezing occurs at -10°C. (Incorrect, the phase change happens at 0°C).
        *   Interpretation 2: Water *is frozen* at -10°C. (Correct, it exists as ice).
    *   Alice's statement: "Water freezes at 0 degrees celsius." (Correct, this is the freezing point).
    *   Bob's counter: "Yes, but I'm still right."

4.  **Determine Who is "Right":**
    *   Alice is scientifically precise about the *freezing point* (0°C).
    *   Bob is colloquially correct about the *state* of water at -10°C (it is frozen).
    *   However, the phrase "Water freezes at X" usually refers to the temperature at which the phase transition occurs.
    *   If Bob means "Water is frozen at -10°C", he is right about the state.
    *   If Bob means "The freezing point is -10°C", he is wrong.
    *   Given Alice's correction ("No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius"), she is addressing the freezing point.
    *   Bob's insistence ("Yes, but I'm still right") suggests he means "At -10°C, water is frozen."
    *   Technically, Alice is more accurate regarding the definition of "freezes at" (phase change temperature). Bob is accurate regarding the state of water at that temperature.
    *   However, in common parlance, saying "Water freezes at -10°C" implies the transition point is -10°C, which is false. Saying "Water is frozen at -10°C" is true.
    *   Alice is right about the freezing point. Bob is right about the state.
    *   Who is *more* right in the context of the question "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
        *   Answer: It is ice / It is frozen.
        *   Bob said: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius." This is grammatically slightly off for describing the state. It sounds like a definition of the freezing point.
        *   Alice said: "Water freezes at 0 degrees celsius." This is the definition of the freezing point.
    *   Actually, both have a point. Alice corrects the freezing point. Bob implies the state.
    *   But strictly speaking, water *freezes* (the verb indicating the process) at 0°C. At -10°C, it *is frozen*.
    *   Therefore, Alice is scientifically more accurate about the term "freezes at". Bob is colloquially understood but technically imprecise.
    *   However, the prompt asks "Who is right?".
    *   Alice is right about the freezing point.
    *   Bob is right that water is frozen at -10°C.
    *   Usually, this riddle relies on the distinction between the *process* (freezing point) and the *state* (being frozen).
    *   Alice: Freezing point = 0°C. (True)
    *   Bob: At -10°C, water is frozen. (True)
    *   Bob's phrasing "Water freezes at -10°C" is the contentious part.
    *   Most logical conclusion: Both are right in different senses, but Alice is technically correct about the freezing point, while Bob is correct about the condition of water at that temperature.
    *   However, if forced to choose based on scientific accuracy of the phrase "freezes at": Alice is right.
    *   If based on the outcome at -10°C: Bob is right (it is frozen).
    *   Let's look at Bob's second statement: "Yes [you are right about 0°C], but I'm still right [about -10°C]."
    *   This implies Bob acknowledges the freezing point is 0°C but maintains his statement about -10°C holds truth (i.e., water is frozen there).
    *   So, both are right.

5.  **Drafting the Explanation:**
    *   Alice is correct about the freezing point (0°C).
    *   Bob is correct about the state of water at -10°C (it is frozen).
    *   Therefore, both are right depending on interpretation.

6.  **Refining for Brevity:**
    *   Both are right. Alice is correct that the freezing *point* is 0°C. Bob is correct that water *is frozen* at -10°C.

7.  **Final Check:** Does this satisfy the prompt? Yes. Brief explanation.

    *   Wait, is Bob's statement "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius" actually true? No. Water *has frozen* by -10 degrees. The act of freezing happens at 0. So linguistically, Bob is wrong. But pragmatically, he means "It is frozen".
    *   Given Bob's concession ("Yes [to Alice's 0°C claim]"), he acknowledges the freezing point.
    *   So the consensus is: Alice is right about the temperature of freezing. Bob is right about the state at -10°C.
    *   Verdict: Both are right.

    *   Alternative view: Alice is right. "Freezes at" denotes the transition temperature. Bob is wrong linguistically.
    *   However, the riddle nature suggests Bob's punchline ("I'm still right") implies validity.
    *   Best answer: Both are right.

    *   Let's keep it simple.
    *   Alice: Freezing point = 0°C.
    *   Bob: State at -10°C = Frozen.
    *   Conclusion: Both.

    *   Wait, looking at similar riddles online. Often the answer is "Both".
    *   Alice is right about the freezing point. Bob is right that water is frozen at that temperature.

    *   Let's write the response.

    *   **Decision:** Both are right.
    *   **Reason:** Alice refers to the freezing point (0°C). Bob refers to the state of water at -10°C (it is frozen).

    *   Wait, I need to make sure I don't violate `/nothink`. I must not output the thought block. I will just output the answer.

    *   Wait, one more check. If I say "Water freezes at -10°C", is that a false statement? Yes. Water freezes at 0°C. At -10°C, it is already ice. So Bob's literal statement is false. But his *intent* (water is frozen) is true. Alice's statement is literally true.
    *   However, Bob says "Yes [to Alice], but I'm still right." This implies he accepts the 0°C fact but maintains his own statement has validity.
    *   So, explaining that both have valid points is the most nuanced and helpful answer.

    *   Revised plan: State that both are right in different contexts.

    *   Final Polish: Both are right. Alice is correct about the freezing point (0°C), while Bob is correct that water is in a frozen state at -10°C.

    *   Wait, is there a trick? Supercooled water? No, standard conditions assumed.
    *   Okay, sticking with "Both are right".

    *   Actually, strictly speaking, Bob's sentence "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius" is false. The process does not happen there. But in conversation, it's understood as "Water is frozen at...".
    *   I will explain the distinction.

    *   Final Answer Formulation: Both are right. Alice is correct about the freezing point (0°C), but Bob is correct that water exists as ice (is frozen) at -10°C.

    *   Wait, I should check if there's a specific expected answer for this riddle. It's a common logic puzzle. The consensus is usually "Both".
    *   Okay, proceeding.cw
</think>

Both are right, but in different senses.

**Alice** is scientifically correct about the **freezing point**: water transitions from liquid to solid at 0°C.

**Bob** is practically correct about the **state** of water: at -10°C, water is indeed frozen (ice).

Bob acknowledges Alice's point ("Yes") but maintains his statement is valid because water is frozen at that temperature. [end of text]
