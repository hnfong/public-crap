A - Azeroth (World of Warcraft itself)
B - Blackrock Spire (Tanaris)
C - Deadmines (Westfall)
D - Duskwood (A human territory haunted by dark forces)
E - Elwynn Forest (A region near Stormwind)
F - Fallen Stockade (Alterac Mountains)
G - Gadgetzan (A neutral city in Stranglethorn Vale)
H - Hillsbrad Foothills (A human territory near Stormwind)
I - Ironforge (The capital city of the Dwarves)
J - Jintha'alor (A troll city in Stranglethorn Vale)
K - Kalimdor (The continent where Night Elves and Dwarves coexist)
L - Loch Modan (A serene lake area in the Eastern Kingdoms)
M - Mulgore (The homeland of the Tauren)
N - Northshire Valley (A region in Elwynn Forest)
O - Orgrimmar (The capital city of the Orcs)
P - Plaguefang Swamp (Part of the Eastern Plaguelands)
Q - Quel'Thalas (The homeland of the High Elves, now scourged by the Scourge)
R - Razorfen Downs (A troll infested area in the Swamp of Sorrows)
S - Silvermoon City (The capital city of the Blood Elves)
T - Tirisfal Glades (A peaceful human region)

This list covers a wide range of locations across Azeroth, from the peaceful glades of the human territories to the dark, mysterious places infested with trolls and other dangers.
