**A) Does water freeze at -12 °C?**  
No, pure water normally freezes at 0 °C under standard atmospheric pressure. At -12 °C, water would already be solidly frozen (well below its normal freezing point). However, under certain conditions (e.g., very pure water, absence of nucleation sites), it can remain liquid below 0 °C as supercooled water, but -12 °C is far enough below the freezing point that it will almost always be frozen.

**B) What happens if a glass of pure water is cooled to -12 °C?**  
If the water is pure and undisturbed, it may initially remain liquid as supercooled water (below 0 °C without freezing). Once it does freeze—often triggered by a disturbance, nucleation event, or impurities—it will turn to ice. The transition releases latent heat, causing a brief temperature rise. The final result is a glass of ice at -12 °C (or possibly colder, depending on the exact conditions). If the water is allowed to freeze slowly and evenly, you would end up with a solid block of ice.
