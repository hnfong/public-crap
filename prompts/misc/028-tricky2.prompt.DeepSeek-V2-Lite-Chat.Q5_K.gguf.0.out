User: Alice: "What happens to water at -10 degrees celsius?"
Bob: "Water freezes at -10 degrees celsius."
Alice: "No, water freezes at 0 degrees celsius."
Bob: "Yes, but I'm still right."

Who is right? Explain briefly.


Assistant: 0 degrees Celsius is the freezing point of water, but Bob is right in this context. When Bob says "water freezes at -10 degrees Celsius," he is referring to the temperature at which water actually freezes. In the context of this conversation, Bob is correct, even though Alice's statement is technically accurate. [end of text]
