Okay, imagine London has a really, really big group of people who help decide what rules everyone in London follows, right? Like, they might decide about building new playgrounds or making sure everyone has enough schools.

Well, China is a *very* big country, much bigger than the UK! And they have a group of people called the National People Congress, or NPC for short. 

Think of them like a giant team of helpers for China. They're like a big group of grown-ups who meet and talk about important things for all the people in China. They help make new rules and laws, a bit like the people in Parliament do in London.

They don't *make* all the decisions themselves, but they check and agree on the big plans that other people in China have made. It's like they're saying, "Okay, that sounds like a good idea for everyone in China!"

So, the National People Congress is a big group of people who help make sure China runs smoothly and that everyone has what they need. They're like a really, really big team of helpers!



Does that make sense? ðŸ˜Š [end of text]
