Okay, here are the answers to your questions with brief explanations:

**A) Does water freeze at -12 degrees Celsius?**

Yes, water freezes at -12 degrees Celsius (50 degrees Fahrenheit). This is a common freezing point for water.

**B) What happens if I have a glass of pure water and cool it down to -12 degrees Celsius?**

If you cool pure water down to -12 degrees Celsius, it will begin to freeze.  The water molecules will slow down and arrange themselves into a crystalline structure – ice.  It will become solid, but it won’t be a liquid.
