Okay, so Alice and Bob are having a conversation about water freezing. Alice asks what happens to water at -10 degrees Celsius, and Bob says it freezes. Then Alice corrects him, saying water freezes at 0 degrees, and Bob insists he's still right. Hmm, I need to figure out who's correct here.

First, I remember that the freezing point of water is 0 degrees Celsius. That's when it turns into ice under standard conditions. So, at 0°C, water starts to freeze. But what happens when the temperature is lower than that, like -10°C? Well, if water is already frozen at 0°C, then at -10°C, it's just colder. So the water would still be frozen, right? It doesn't re-freeze or anything; it's just staying frozen.

So, Bob's initial statement that water freezes at -10°C might be a bit misleading because the actual freezing happens at 0°C. But once it's frozen, it remains frozen below that temperature. So, at -10°C, water is indeed frozen. Therefore, Bob is correct in saying that water freezes at -10°C because it's already in a frozen state, even though the freezing process begins at 0°C.

I think the confusion comes from the wording. Alice is pointing out the exact temperature where freezing starts, while Bob is talking about the state of water at a temperature below freezing. So both are correct in their own ways, but Bob's statement is accurate in the context of the temperature given.

Bob is correct. Water freezes at 0°C, but at -10°C, it remains frozen. So, while the freezing point is 0°C, at -10°C, water is indeed frozen. [end of text]
