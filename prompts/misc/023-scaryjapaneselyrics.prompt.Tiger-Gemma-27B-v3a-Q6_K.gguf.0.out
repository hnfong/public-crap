The song tells the story of a very peculiar, and ultimately fatal, restaurant hidden deep within a forest. It's not a metaphor; it's a literal, albeit bizarre, establishment. 

The lyrics describe a place you can't reach by normal means ("following acorns won't get you there"), only by being forgotten by someone. This suggests the restaurant exists in a liminal space, accessible only to those who have faded from memory. The fact that there are no reservations, yet empty seats during lunchtime, implies it caters to ghosts, lost souls, or those who have willingly relinquished their place in the living world. The laughing birds are not cheerful; they're mocking the patrons' fate.

The "red-painted tin roof" and limited menu ("only the recommendation") hint at a deliberately deceptive, almost predatory nature. The sounds of classical instruments from the kitchen aren't welcoming; they're the soundtrack to a final meal. The invitation ("welcome, welcome, come in, eat until you fall asleep") is a lure, and the "goodbye" is permanent. 

The nonsensical phrase "tomorrow is tomorrow, etcetera" reinforces the timeless, inescapable nature of this place. The "right to left" dance of the bear and the listing of dishes (carpaccio, paella, etc.) are distractions, a final indulgence before the inevitable. The chilling line "we'll deliver it to your grave" confirms that this is a death meal. There is no dessert because there is no future. 

The restaurant isn't just serving food; it's serving oblivion. It's a place where you go to be completely erased, and the only way out is to be consumed entirely. The song is a dark, whimsical invitation to a feast that ends in non-existence.
