A) No, water does not freeze at -12°C. Water freezes at 0°C (32°F) under standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm or 101.3 kPa).

B) If you have a glass of pure water and cool it down to -12°C, the water will remain liquid. This is because the water is supercooled—it has not yet frozen despite being below its freezing point. However, it is in a metastable state and could freeze if disturbed or if a seed crystal is introduced. [end of text]
