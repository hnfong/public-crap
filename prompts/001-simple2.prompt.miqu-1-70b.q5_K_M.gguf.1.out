Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?



### Response:

Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties and significance in mathematics:

1. It is highly composite, meaning it has more divisors than any other number smaller than itself. The divisors of 120 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
2. It is a triangular number because it can be represented as a triangle with dots (the sum of the first 8 natural numbers: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8).
3. It is a tetrahedral number because it can be represented as a pyramid with a triangular base (the sum of the first 4 triangular numbers).
4. It is the smallest number divisible by all integers from 1 to 6.
5. It is the order of the smallest nonabelian simple group, known as Aâ‚… or the alternating group on 5 elements.

Q2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula. Using factoring, we find two numbers that multiply to -18 and add up to -7. These numbers are -9 and +2, so the factors of the equation are (x-9)(x+2). Therefore, the solutions for x are x=9 and x=-2.

Q3: If a train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart, it takes t = d/s = 200 / 60 = 10/3 hours for a one-way trip. Since there is negligible time spent in the cities, this means that each round trip takes twice as long or approximately 20/3 hours. In a full day of 24 hours, we can calculate how many trips the train can make by dividing the total available time (in hours) by the time taken for one round trip: 24 / (20/3) = 24 * (3/20) = 72 / 20 = 3.6. Since partial trips are not counted, the train can make 3 complete round trips between the two cities within a full day.
