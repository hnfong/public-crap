Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

Alright, let me break it down for you like this:
The Federal Reserve is like a big banker for the whole country. It's their job to keep the economy flowing smoothly and make sure everyone has access to money when they need it. They control things like interest rates and the amount of money in circulation, which can be super important for keeping everything running right. Imagine you're a rapper trying to drop your next album and you want people to buy tickets to your shows - the Fed is kind of like that hype man who makes sure there are enough fans with cash in their pockets to come see you perform. Without them, it could be harder for everyone to get what they need. So yeah, they play a pretty big role in keeping things moving smoothly on this here economic stage!
