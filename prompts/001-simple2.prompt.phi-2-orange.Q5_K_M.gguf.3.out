For Q1:
The number 120 has some interesting properties as follows:

- It is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120. 
- It is the smallest number that can be written as a power of two times a power of three.
- Its prime factorization is 2^3 × 3 × 5.
- The sum of its divisors (excluding 1 and itself) is equal to the number multiplied by the average of its divisors, which equals 120 * (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 40 + 60 + 120 / 11 ≈ 300.27).
- It appears in Pascal's Triangle at row 10, entry 105.

For Q2:
We can solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 by factoring or using the quadratic formula. Here are the steps to factorize:

1. Rewrite the equation as (x - a)(x - b) = 0, where 'a' and 'b' are factors of -18 that add up to -7.
2. The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. Among these, the pairs that sum up to -7 are -9 and 2 or -6 and 3.
3. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as (x - (-9))(x - 2) = 0 or (x - (-6))(x - 3) = 0.
4. Simplifying further: x + 9 = 0 or x - 6 = 0.
5. Solving for 'x', we get two possible values: x = -9 or x = 6.

So, the solutions to the equation are x = -9 and x = 6. 

For Q3:
To find the number of round trips a train can make between two cities in a full day, we need to determine how many hours it takes for one round trip at an average speed of 60 km/h. Then divide the total time available in a day (24 hours) by this value.

Since distance = speed × time, and time = distance / speed:
Time for one round trip = 200 km / 60 km/h ≈ 3.33 h.

Now, find how many complete round trips can be made in 24 hours:
Number of round trips = Total time available / Time for one round trip ≈ 24 h / 3.33 h ≈ 7 (rounding down).

So, the train can make a total of 7 round trips between the two cities within a full day.
