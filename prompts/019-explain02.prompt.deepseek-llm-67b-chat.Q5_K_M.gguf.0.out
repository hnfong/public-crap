The National People's Congress in China is like a big group of important people who help make decisions for the country. They talk about big things like how to make people's lives better, how to protect the environment, and how to keep China safe. Just like how you might have a family meeting to decide what to do on the weekend, the National People's Congress is like a big family meeting for the whole country. They meet once a year to talk about important stuff and make decisions for everyone in China.
