Given 4 numbers, (4, 3, 1, 8), construct a mathematical expression so that the result is 24.

Make sure you double and triple check the result in the following format:

```
Attempt: (8 - 4) * (3 + 1) = 4 * 4 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24
Double checking: 8 * 3 + 4 - 1 = 24 + 4 - 1 = 27, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 4 * 5 + 4 = 24
Double checking: 4 * (8 - 3) + 4 = 24. Numbers used: (4, 8, 3, 4), which is incorrect. Retrying
```

Repeat this until the answer is 24 and you only used the numbers (4, 3, 1, 8).
 [/INST] Attempt: (8 - 3) * (4 - 1) = 5 * 3 = 15, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (4 - 3 - 1) = 8 * 0 = 0, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 3 - (4 + 1) = 24 - 5 = 19, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (4 - (3 - 1)) = 8 * 2 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 - 1) * 3 - 4 = 7 * 3 - 4 = 21 - 4 = 17, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (4 - 1) * (8 - 3) = 3 * 5 = 15, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (4 * 1 - 3) = 8 * (4 - 3) = 8 * 1 = 8, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 - 3) * 4 + 1 = 5 * 4 + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * 4 - (3 + 1) = 32 - 4 = 28, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (4 * 1 - 3 + 1) = 8 * (4 - 3) = 8 * 1 = 8, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 - 1) * 4 - 3 = 7 * 4 - 3 = 28 - 3 = 25, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: (8 - 3) * (4 - 1) + 1 = 5 * 3 + 1 = 15 + 1 = 16, which is not 24. Retrying
Attempt: 8 * (4 - (3 - 1)) +
