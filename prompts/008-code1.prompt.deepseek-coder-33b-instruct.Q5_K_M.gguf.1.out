### Instruction:

Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.


### Response:

Bubble Sort is an easy-to-implement, but inefficient algorithm that works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process repeats from the beginning of the list until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.

Here's a Python implementation:

```python
def bubble_sort(lst):
    for num in range(len(lst)-1,0,-1):
        for i in range(num):
            if lst[i]>lst[i+1]:
                temp = lst[i]
                lst[i] = lst[i+1]
                lst[i+1] = temp
    return lst
```

On the other hand, Merge Sort is a more efficient and commonly used sorting algorithm that works by dividing an unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted), then repeatedly merging sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. 

Here's a Python implementation:

```python
def merge_sort(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return lst
    mid = len(lst) // 2
    left_half = lst[:mid]
    right_half = lst[mid:]
    
    return merge(merge_sort(left_half), merge_sort(right_half))
  
def merge(left, right):
    merged = []
    while left and right:
        if left[0] <= right[0]:
            merged.append(left.pop(0))
        else:
            merged.append(right.pop(0))
    merged.extend(left if left else right)
    
    return merged
```

Comparisons: 

1. Efficiency: Bubble sort is easy to understand and implement, but it's not efficient for large datasets since its average and worst-case complexity are both O(n^2), where n is the number of items being sorted. Merge sort has better performance with time complexity of O(N log N).

2. Memory: Bubble sort does not require any additional storage (besides a few variables) so it's space efficient. However, merge sort requires auxiliary space that is equal to the size of input list (in-place version is possible but it makes the algorithm more complex).

3. Stability: Bubble sort and Merge sort are stable algorithms which means they maintain the relative order of elements with equal values.

4. Use case: Generally, merge sort is used when dealing with large datasets because its performance is better than bubble sort. For smaller data sets or nearly sorted arrays, bubble sort might be more efficient. 

It's important to note that while bubble sort has the advantage of being simple and easier to understand due to its low overhead, it should be avoided for larger lists due to its high time complexity (quadratic). Merge sort is a much better choice in terms of performance and scalability.
