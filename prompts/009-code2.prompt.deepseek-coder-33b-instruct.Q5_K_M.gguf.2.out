### Instruction:

Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").


### Response:

This problem can be solved by using two-pointers method and Binary Search. Firstly, we will use a binary search to find the block size (let's say block size is 'bs') that can fit into memory, then we would perform a binary search on each of these blocks. The idea is to take advantage of the fact that names are sorted in lexicographical order.

Here is an example Python solution:

```python
import os

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    # Get file size
    file_size = os.stat(file_path).st_size
    
    # Determine block size that can fit into memory
    mem_block = 4096  # This is the block size that fits into memory, adjust accordingly
    bs = min(mem_block // 15, file_size) # Assuming each line is less than or equal to 15 characters
    
    left, right = 0, file_size - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right + 1) // 2
        
        # Adjust current position to the beginning of a block
        if mid % bs != 0:
            mid -= mid % bs
            
        with open(file_path) as file:
            file.seek(mid, 0)
            line = file.readline()
        
        # If the target is less than the current block's first element, we go left
        if target < line:
            right = mid - bs
            
        # Else we go right
        else:
            left = mid 
    
    with open(file_path) as file:
        file.seek(left, 0)
        lines = file.readlines()
        
    for i in range(len(lines)):
        if target <= lines[i]:
            return (left // bs) * bs + i + 1
    
    return -1   # Return -1 if the target is not found
```

The binary_search_file function takes a file path and a target name as arguments. It first determines the block size 'bs' that can fit into memory, then performs a binary search on each of these blocks. In this implementation, we use the seek() method to position the file pointer at the desired location in the file.

Please note: 
- The code above assumes that each line in the text file is less than or equal to 15 characters long (including '\n'). This can be adjusted according to your needs.
- The os.stat() function is used to get the size of the file.

Remember that this solution will work best if you have enough memory to fit the block size into memory, otherwise it might not be very efficient.
