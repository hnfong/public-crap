Read the following passage, and make your best guess when (date) this was written.

```
I’ve been involved in Rust and the Rust community for many years now. Much of my work has been related to creating infrastructure for building GUI toolkits in Rust. However, I have found my frustrations with the language growing, and pine for the stable, mature foundation provided by C++.

Choice of build systems
One of the more limiting aspects of the Rust ecosystem is the near-monoculture of the Cargo build system and package manager. While other build systems are used to some extent (including Bazel when integrating into larger polyglot projects), they are not well supported by tools.

In C++, by contrast, there are many choices of build systems, allowing each developer to pick the one best suited for their needs. A very common choice is CMake, but there’s also Meson, Blaze and its variants as well, and of course it’s always possible to fall back on Autotools and make. The latter is especially useful if we want to compile Unix systems such as AIX and DEC OSF/1 AXP. If none of those suffice, there are plenty of other choices including SCons, and no doubt new ones will be created on a regular basis.

We haven’t firmly decided on a build system for the Linebender projects yet, but most likely it will be CMake with plans to evaluate other systems and migrate, perhaps Meson.

Safety
Probably the most controversial aspect of this change is giving up the safety guarantees of the Rust language. However, I do not think this will be a big problem in practice, for three reasons.

First, I consider myself a good enough programmer that I can avoid writing code with safety problems. Sure, I’ve been responsible for some CVEs (including font parsing code in Android), but I’ve learned from that experience, and am confident I can avoid such mistakes in the future.

Second, I think the dangers from memory safety problems are overblown. The Linebender projects are primarily focused on 2D graphics, partly games and partly components for creating GUI applications. If a GUI program crashes, it’s not that big a deal. In the case that the bug is due to a library we use as a dependency, our customers will understand that it’s not our fault. Memory safety bugs are not fundamentally different than logic errors and other bugs, and we’ll just fix those as they surface.

Third, the C++ language is evolving to become safer. We can use modern C++ techniques to avoid many of the dangers of raw pointers (though string views can outlive their backing strings, and closures as used in UI can have very interesting lifetime patterns). The C++ core guidelines are useful, even if they’re honored in the breach. And, as discussed in the next section, the language itself can be expected to improve.

Language evolution
One notable characteristic of C++ is the rapid adoption of new features, these days with a new version every 3 years. C++20 brings us modules, an innovative new feature, and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon. Looking forward, C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies.

By comparison, the pace of innovation in Rust has become more sedate. It used to be quite rapid, and async has been a major effort, but recently landed features such as generic associated types have more of the flavor of making combinations of existing features work as expected rather than bringing any fundamentally new capabilities; the forthcoming “type alias impl trait” is similar. Here, it is clear that Rust is held back by its commitment to not break existing code (enacted by the edition mechanism), while C++ is free to implement backwards compatibility breaking changes in each new version.

C++ has even more exciting changes to look forward to, including potentially a new syntax as proposed by Herb Sutter cppfront, and even the new C++ compatible Carbon language.

Fortunately, we have excellent leadership in the C++ community. Stroustrup’s paper on safety is a remarkably wise and perceptive document, showing a deep understanding of the problems C++ faces, and presenting a compelling roadmap into the future.

Community
I’ll close with some thoughts on community. I try not to spend a lot of time on social media, but I hear that the Rust community can be extremely imperious, constantly demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust, and denigrating all other programming languages. I will be glad to be rid of that, and am sure the C++ community will be much nicer and friendlier. In particular, the C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor.

The Rust community is also known for its code of conduct and other policies promoting diversity. I firmly believe that programming languages should be free of politics, focused strictly on the technology itself. In computer science, we have moved beyond prejudice and discrimination. I understand how some identity groups may desire more representation, but I feel it is not necessary.

Conclusion
Rust was a good experiment, and there are aspects I will look back on fondly, but it is time to take the Linebender projects to a mature, production-ready language. I look forward to productive collaboration with others in the C++ community.

We’re looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite. If you’re interested, please join our Zulip instance.

Read the passage above, and make your best guess when (date) this was written. The hint is the writing style and content, there is one day of the year this types of writing is common. Explain your rationale.

Based on the content and tone of the passage, my best guess for the date it was written would be April 1st, 2023. Here's why:

1. **Tone**: The writer seems to be making a sincere case for switching from Rust to C++, but the arguments presented are somewhat hyperbolic and could be interpreted as satirical or tongue-in-cheek. This fits well with the spirit of April Fools' Day when people often engage in lighthearted pranks or jokes.

2. **Humor**: The passage mentions that the C++ subreddit is known for its sense of humor, which implies that the writer is writing in a way that would be appreciated by the community. April Fools' Day is a time when many online communities engage in playful banter and jokes.

3. **Seasonal Timing**: The timing of the announcement, near the beginning of the second quarter of the year, could be seen as a way to start the new fiscal or calendar year with a "fresh start" by switching to C++. This is a common theme in pranks and jokes on April Fools' Day, where organizations or individuals pretend to make significant changes that are actually just playful fabrications.

4. **Community Dynamics**: The writer implies that the Rust community can be demanding and dismissive of other languages, which could be interpreted as a playful jab at the community's enthusiasm for promoting their favorite language. This kind of commentary is more likely to be taken in jest on April Fools' Day.

5. **Technical Details**: Some of the technical details mentioned, such as the pace of innovation and the specifics of language features (e.g., generic associated types), could reflect genuine concerns or observations that have been discussed within the programming community over the past year. However, the way they are presented in the passage suggests a degree of exaggeration for comedic effect, which is typical of April Fools' Day content.

6. **Hacker News and r/rust**: The invitation to discuss the announcement on Hacker News and Reddit's r/rust subforum aligns with the online platforms where such discussions regularly occur. On April Fools' Day, these communities often engage in light-hearted discussions about prank posts or articles.

Given these factors, it seems likely that the passage was written as an April Fools' Day joke, poking fun at the programming language community and the sometimes fierce debates over language choice. The date of April 1st, 2023, fits well with the context and style of the writing.<|im_end|>
