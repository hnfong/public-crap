 

### Instruction:

Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.


### Response:

No, as the while loop is infinite and never terminates. Therefore there are no such input values that would print out "Done".
