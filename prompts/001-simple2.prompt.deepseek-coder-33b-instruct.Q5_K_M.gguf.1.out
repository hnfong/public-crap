Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?



### Response:

Q1: The significance of the number 120 is significant as it is the least common multiple of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. It's also known as "triangular number" and "factorial of 3". Besides, it appears in many different areas of mathematics such as finance, architecture, art, music etc. For instance, a triangle with sides equal to 1-120 has the greatest area among all equilateral triangles.

Q2: The equation is a quadratic equation where x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0. To solve this, we can use the formula for solving quadratic equations which is:
   x = [-(-b) ± sqrt((-b)^2 - 4ac)] / (2a).

   In our case:
    a = 1, b = -7, c= -18.
    
Substituting these values into the formula gives us:
 x = [7 ± sqrt((-7)^2 - 4*1*(-18))] / (2*1).

So we get two solutions for x:
    First solution, when adding: x = [7 + sqrt(5)]/2 = 1 + 6.5 = 7.5 
    Second solution, when subtracting: x = [7 - sqrt(5)]/2 = 1 - 6.5 = -0.5. 
    
Therefore, the solutions of the equation are x = 7.5 and x = -0.5.

Q3: The train travels between two cities in one direction for a distance of 200 km at an average speed of 60 km/h. Since it's a round trip, it travels the same distance in both directions which makes the total distance traveled twice the actual distance. This means that it can make 100 hours worth of trips within a day.

Note: The above calculation assumes that the train is not stopped for rest or recharging at either city. If there were any time stationed, we would need to subtract this from the total travel time.
