<s> <用户>Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

<AI> Bubble sort and Merge sort are both comparison-based sorting algorithms that work in a way. Bubble sort is compare elements in list elements. List-element one pass-by-by-comparing-comparing, comparing-each--comparing, and-elements-s-swapping-places. Merge sort pass-swapping-ing-elements-s-smallest-s-s-sorted-s-elements-ends-end,largest-smallest-end-largest.



```python
def bubble_bubble_sort(arr):
  
    n = len(len(arr)
 for i (i in range(n i(n) (n):
    for j in i(i (i(i+1) (n):
     if(a(arri(i) > i (i): swap(j (a (a i, j)
(j)
 return arr



def merge(bubble_merge(arr):
left:right):
 = []
left:right = sorted
right:= []
for i=(i (i(i) (n (right i (0 (): i (i):= (i
(n- 1)
): for j(i(j (j (left) (i ( j (j):
 (a): left.append(j):a (j
, a)
right.append(a
right
return
```
