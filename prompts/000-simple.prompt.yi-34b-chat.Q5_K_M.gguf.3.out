Q1: 1 + 1 = 2
Q2: 6 * 7 = 42
Q3: 83 * 59 = 4997 (I am not sure, but I think the answer is approximately 4997)
Q4: 349 * 683 = 238777 (I am not sure, but I think the answer is approximately 238777)
Q5: 6043 * 7489 = 45190877 (I am not sure, but I think the answer is approximately 45190877)
Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.
   3x = 22 - 7
   3x = 15
   x = 15 / 3
   x = 5
Q7: What is 25% of 80?
   0.25 * 80 = 20
Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her a an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?
   The shopkeeper initially receives: 2 * $20 + $5 = $45
   Subtract the cost of the book from this amount: $45 - $15 = $30
   Since you gave an additional $5, the final change the shopkeeper should give you is: $30 - $5 = $25
Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.
   Perimeter of a square = 4 * side length
   = 4 * 5
   = 20 units
Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?
   Katherine's family includes herself, so the total number of children is: 2 (brothers) + 1 (sister) + 1 (Katherine) = 4 children
Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1
   12 รท 4 = 3
   So, the expression becomes: 3 + 3 - 1
   = 6 - 1
   = 5
Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?
   I'm assuming each guest gets one slice of cake. If so, the number of slices needed is equal to the number of guests: 5 slices
Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?
   The discount amount = 20% of original price
   Discount amount = 0.20 * $25
   Discount amount = $5
   Sale price = Original price - Discount amount
   Sale price = $25 - $5
   Sale price = $20
Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?
   To find the number of minutes left, we first need to find out how many minutes are in the remaining time interval:
   From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM is a difference of 2 hours and 15 minutes.
   So, the number of minutes left until 6:30 PM is: 60 (minutes in an hour) * 2 + 15 = 135 minutes
Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?
   To find out how many taxis are needed, we divide the number of people by the capacity of each taxi:
   22 people / 4 passengers per taxi = 5.5 taxis
   Since you can't have half a taxi, you would need to round up to the nearest whole taxi, meaning 6 taxis are needed.
Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?
   The sum of all three angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. Therefore, if we know the measures of two angles, we can find the measure of the third angle by subtracting the sum of the known angles from 180 degrees:
   Third angle = 180 - (31 + 62)
   Third angle = 180 - 93
   Third angle = 87 degrees<|im_end|>
