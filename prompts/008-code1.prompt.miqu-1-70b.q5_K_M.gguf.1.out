Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.


### Response:

Bubble Sort Algorithm:

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. This algorithm gets its name because with each iteration the largest element "bubbles up" to its correct position.

Here's a Python implementation of Bubble Sort:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
  
    for i in range(n):
        # Create a flag that will allow the function 
        # to terminate early if there's nothing left 
        # to sort
        swapped = False
  
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            # Swap elements if current element is greater than next
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]
                swapped = True
        # If no two elements were swapped in inner loop, then the list is sorted
        if not swapped:
            break
    return arr
```

Merge Sort Algorithm:

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits an input array into two equal halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the two sorted halves. The key process in merge sort is merging, which is done by comparing elements from both input halves to produce the output sequence. 

Here's a Python implementation of Merge Sort:

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
  
    # split the array into two halves and sort them recursively
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i, j = 0, 0
  
    # compare elements from both arrays and add the smaller one to the result
    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] <= right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1
  
    # add remaining elements from both arrays to the result
    result.extend(left[i:])
    result.extend(right[j:])
    return result
```

Comparison between Bubble Sort and Merge Sort:

* Speed: In terms of speed, merge sort is generally faster than bubble sort. The average time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2), while the time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n). This means that for larger datasets, merge sort will be significantly faster than bubble sort.
* Space Complexity: Merge sort requires additional space proportional to the size of the input array because it creates new arrays during the merging process. On the other hand, bubble sort has a space complexity of O(1) as it only swaps elements in place and does not require any additional memory.
* Stability: Merge sort is stable, meaning that equal elements maintain their relative order after sorting, while bubble sort is not guaranteed to be stable.
* Simplicity: Bubble sort is simpler and easier to understand than merge sort. The algorithm can be implemented with only a few lines of code, whereas merge sort requires more complex logic for splitting and merging arrays.
