Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

 No, there is no input that will lead to the output "Done" for this program. The reason is that the while loop condition x < math.inf (x is less than infinity) is always true. So, the loop continues running forever without ever reaching the print statement.
