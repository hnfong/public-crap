What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)

The output of the given Python program would be 2.0000000000000004. The reason for this is that you're multiplying 'x' by 1.001 in each iteration while the value of 'x' is less than math.inf (Infinity). Since 0.001 is a very small number, and we are continually multiplying it, the final result will be an extremely small value close to zero but not exactly zero.

In Python 3, `math.inf` equals approximately 1.7976931348623157e+308 which is a very large number. Since 1.001 is significantly smaller than this, even though you're multiplying it by itself in each iteration, the result will be extremely close to 0 but not exactly zero due to floating point precision issues. 

Here's a simple explanation: 

`x = 1.0` is equal to `1`.
In first loop, `x *= 1.001` makes `x` equals to `1 * 1.001` which is approximately `1.001`.
The next time we run the loop, `x < math.inf` becomes `1.001 < math.inf`, so it continues in the loop.
In third loop, `x *= 1.001` makes `x` equals to `1.001 * 1.001` which is approximately `1.002001`. 
The next time we run the loop, `1.002001 < math.inf` becomes `true`, so it continues in the loop.
This process repeats until x reaches a value extremely close to 0 but not exactly zero due to floating point precision issues.
