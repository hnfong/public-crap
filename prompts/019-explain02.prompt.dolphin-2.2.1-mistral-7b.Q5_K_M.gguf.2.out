 The National People Congress is like a big meeting where important people from all over China come together to make decisions for the country. Imagine it as a school council, where they discuss and create rules, plans, and changes to make their schools better. In this case, they're discussing and making decisions that will affect the whole of China - like how to build new schools, parks or even roads. Just like how your teachers help to decide what happens in your classroom, these important people help decide what happens in the whole country!<|im_end|>
