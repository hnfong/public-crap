What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)

This Python program creates an infinite loop where `x` starts at 0.0 and keeps increasing by 1.0 with each iteration of the loop since `x` is never incremented beyond `math.inf`. Therefore, the program will not terminate on its own, and it won't print any output. If you try to run this code, it will continue executing indefinitely until manually stopped.
