What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)

assistant
This Python program creates an infinite loop where `x` starts at 0.0 and keeps getting incremented by 1.0 in each iteration. Since the condition of the while loop is `x < math.inf`, it will never be false because `math.inf` represents positive infinity, and any finite number, no matter how large, is less than infinity.

Therefore, this program will not terminate and will not produce any output unless manually interrupted. If you run this code in a Python environment, it will continue running indefinitely until you stop it. In a practical setting, you should avoid such loops to prevent your program from hanging.
