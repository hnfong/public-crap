Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

As a Federal Reserve Bank, the main role of the Fed is to provide monetary policy for the United States economy. Monetary policy refers to the actions taken by the central bank to influence the flow of money in the economy, including interest rates and the creation or destruction of money.
The Fed has the responsibility to ensure that the US economy remains healthy and stable. To achieve this objective, the Fed's primary tool is open market operations. Open market operations involve buying or selling Federal Reserve assets (such as Treasury bonds or government debt securities) in the marketplace. By doing so, the Fed can influence interest rates by adjusting the amount of money that banks have to borrow and lend.
The Fed's other responsibilities include providing targeted support for certain industries and sectors of the economy, such as housing or agriculture. It also conducts monetary policy through its role in setting short-term interest rates, which are the interest rates at which banks can borrow from the Fed.
In a rap verse, the rapper could use the following clauses to explain their understanding of the Fed's primary tool and its impact on economic stability:
"The Federal Reserve Bank is the go-to institution for the US economy. It plays a critical role in monetary policy."
"With open market operations, the Fed can influence interest rates and provide targeted support to certain industries."
"The Fed helps banks keep their cash flowing by adjusting short-term interest rates."
"They're responsible for ensuring that the economy remains stable through open market operations and other tools."
"As a rap verse, don't be afraid to use technical terms from the banking world. It adds an air of authority to your rhyme scheme."
