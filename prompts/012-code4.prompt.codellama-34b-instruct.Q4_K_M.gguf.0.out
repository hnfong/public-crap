What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)


### Response:

This will run forever without printing anything since the while loop condition `x < math.inf` is always true, and we are not changing `x` within the loop to break out of it.
