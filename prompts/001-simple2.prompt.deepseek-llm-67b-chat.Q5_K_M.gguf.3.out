Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

A1: The number 120 has several significant mathematical properties, including being a triangular number and a highly composite number. Some of these properties are:
- It's a triangular number (the sum of the first 11 positive integers).
- It is an even abundant number (its proper divisors add up to more than itself) with a sum of divisors equal to 240.
- It's the smallest highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer. Specifically, it has 16 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60 and 120.
- It's the product of four consecutive integers: 5 × 6 × 7 × 8 = 120.
- In a deck of cards (with 52 cards), it takes exactly 120 seconds to shuffle if you perform one riffle every second, as there are 52! ways to arrange the cards and 3600 seconds in an hour (52 factorial is approximately 8.06 x 10^67).
- It's used in several ancient numbering systems: for example, the Babylonian system had a base of 60, so 120 was considered special. Similarly, the Egyptians and Mayans also used bases related to 120.
- It is divisible by each number from 1 through 10 (except seven).

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

A2: You can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, which states that if you have an equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, then the solutions for x are given by:

x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a

In this case, a=1, b=-7 and c=-18. Plugging these values into the formula gives us two possible solutions for x:

x₁ = (7 + √((-7)² - 4*1*(-18))) / (2*1) = (7 + √(49+72)) / 2 = (7 + √121) / 2 = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18/2 = 9
x₂ = (7 - √((-7)² - 4*1*(-18))) / (2*1) = (7 - √(49+72)) / 2 = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18/2 = 9

So, the solutions for x are both x=9.

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make within a full day?

A3: The total distance traveled for one round trip is equal to twice the distance between the two cities (one way and another). Therefore, the total distance for one round trip is 2*200 = 400 km. Now let's calculate how long it would take to complete a single round-trip:

Time taken for one round trip = Distance traveled / Speed of train
= Total Distance / Speed
= 400km / (60km/h)
= 13.33 hours (approximately)

Assuming the full day is 24 hours, and each hour includes travel time from both cities:

Number of round trips = Time available in a day / Time taken for one round trip
= 24 hours / 13.33 hours/round trip
≈ 1.80 rounds

Since we cannot have a fraction of a round-trip, the train can make only up to:

Number of completed round trips = Floor (Total number of round trips)
= Floor(1.80)
= 1 Round Trip

So the answer is that one round trip is possible within a full day.
