What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)

The Python program you've provided creates an infinite loop where `x` starts at 0.0 and keeps getting incremented by 1.0 in each iteration since `x` never reaches `math.inf`. Therefore, this program will not terminate on its own and will not produce any output. If you try to run it, it will continue running indefinitely until manually interrupted. 

To interrupt the program, you would typically use a keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C on most terminals), which raises a `KeyboardInterrupt` exception. However, in an interactive environment like a Python shell or Jupyter notebook, the cell may stop executing after a certain time limit or upon manual interruption.
