1+1=2
6*7=42
83\*59=4867
349\*683=238,657
6043\*7489=4,503,217
x = (22 - 7) / 3 = 5
25% of 80 is 0.25 \* 80 = 20
Final change for the book purchase: $15 + ($20 x 2) + $5 = $60, so final change = $60 - $65 = $5
Perimeter of a square with side length of 5 units is 4 \* 5 = 20 units
Katherine's mother has 2 brothers and 1 sister, totaling 3 children.
Evaluate the expression: (3 + 12) / 4 - 1 = 7/4 - 1 = 0.5 - 1 = -0.5
For Tom's party with 5 guests, they need 5 \* x slices of birthday cake, where x is the number of slices per guest. Since we don't know the value of x, we cannot determine the exact number of required slices.
The sale price of a $25 shirt with 20% off is: $25 - (20/100) \* $25 = $25 - $5 = $20
To find the time difference between 3:45 PM and 6:30 PM, subtract smaller time from larger time: 6 hours + 45 minutes - 3 hours + 30 minutes = 3 hours + 75 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so multiply the remaining minutes by 2 (to convert them to hours) and add it back to the hours: 3 \* 100 minutes + 3 hours = 300 minutes + 3 hours = 330 minutes. Subtract this from a full day in minutes (24 \* 60): 1,440 - 330 = 1,110 minutes remaining until 6:30 PM
For the group of 22 people with each taxi carrying 4 passengers, you need ceil(22 / 4) = 5 taxis. If there are only 4 taxis available and no additional transport options, the number of taxis needed would be 4, which means some people will have to find alternative transportation or wait for another ride.
For a triangle with two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, the sum of all three angles should be 180 degrees: 31 + 62 = 93 degrees remaining for the third angle. Since the third angle is always less than 90 degrees when the other two are greater than 30 but less than 90, you can calculate it as 180 - (angle 1 + angle 2) = 180 - 93 = 87 degrees
