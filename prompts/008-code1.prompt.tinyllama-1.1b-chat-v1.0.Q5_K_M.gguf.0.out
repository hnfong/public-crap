Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Bubble sort is an easy sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements in an unsorted array until the whole thing is sorted. The implementation of bubble sort looks like this:

1. Take a random (or given) number of elements from the list to be sorted, say `n`.
2. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to the beginning and end of the list, respectively.
3. While `i < n` and `j > 0`:
    - Swap the adjacent elements (`*i*`) and (`*j*`), as long as the larger one is to the right of the smaller one. This operation is called a "bubble".
4. Move on to the next iteration of the loop, starting at `i`.
5. Repeat step 3 until all elements are sorted:
    - If two adjacent elements have swapped positions, swap them back.
    - Otherwise, move on to the next iteration.

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by splitting an unsorted array into two subarrays and recursively sorting each subarray separately. The implementation of merge sort looks like this:

1. Divide the sorted part (`left` and `right`) of the original array into two subarrays: `left[0...left_end)` and `right[right_start...right_end)`. 2. Recursively call merge sort on each subarray, starting from their respective endpoints. The left subarray (starting at index `left_end`) is called `left_part`. The right subarray (starting at index `right_start`) is called `right_part`. The sorted parts of the two arrays are then merged into a new array: `merge(left_part, right_part)`. This operation is called a "merge".
3. Move on to the next iteration of the loop, starting at `left_end` and `right_start`:
    - If both the left and right subarrays have been sorted, return their sorted parts. If either one hasn't been sorted, move on to the next iteration of the loop.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until all elements are sorted:
    - If two adjacent elements have been sorted, they will be swapped back together.
    - Otherwise, move on to the next iteration.

In terms of comparison between bubble sort and merge sort, both algorithms have their own strengths and weaknesses. Here are some key differences:

1. Bubble sort has a time complexity of `O(n^2)`, which means that it takes linear time for small lists but becomes quadratic for larger lists. Merge sort has a time complexity of `O(n log n)`; the logarithmic term comes from the fact that merge sort recursively splits an unsorted array into two subarrays and then recursively sorts each subarray separately.
2. Bubble sort is generally more stable than merge sort, meaning that it tends to have less swapping (i.e., more "bubbling") and thus can be faster for small lists. However, merge sort has been shown to outperform bubble sort in some cases, particularly for large input sizes.
3. Bubble sort is less efficient for sequences of very small elements or very large elements. For example, if you're sorting a list that only contains 100 or fewer items, bubble sort might work but will likely perform worse than merge sort. Merge sort is more robust to such cases and can be faster in such situations.

In terms of which algorithm to use for your program, it really depends on what data you're working with and how much memory you have available. Bubble sort may work well for small datasets that don't require much sorting; merge sort may be more suitable for large datasets or when sorting large amounts of data simultaneously.
