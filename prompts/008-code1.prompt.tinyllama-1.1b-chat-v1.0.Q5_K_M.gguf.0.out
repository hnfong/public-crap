Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until all the elements have been compared and swapped. The time complexity of Bubble Sort is O(n^2) which means that the algorithm is extremely slow and memory-consuming. Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two subarrays, sorts them recursively, and then combines them back into the original array. The time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n*log n), which makes it much faster than Bubble Sort. The main difference between Bubble Sort and Merge Sort is the number of comparisons and swaps involved in each operation. In Bubble Sort, the algorithm compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. In Merge Sort, the algorithm divides the input array into two subarrays, sorts each of the subarrays recursively, and then combines them back into the original array. Here's a Python implementation of Bubble Sort:
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for I in range(n):
        for j in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```
Here's a Python implementation of Merge Sort:
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) < 10:
        return merge_sort(arr)

    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left_list = arr[:mid]
    right_list = arr[mid:]

    left_result = merge_sort(left_list)
    right_result = merge_sort(right_list)

    i = j = k = 0
    while i < len(left_result) and j < len(right_result):
        if left_result[i] < right_result[j]:
            arr[k] = left_result[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            arr[k] = right_result[j]
            j += 1
        k += 1

    while i < len(left_result):
        arr[k] = left_result[i]
        i += 1
        k += 1

    while j < len(right_result):
        arr[k] = right_result[j]
        j += 1
        k += 1

    return arr
```
Both the Bubble Sort and Merge Sort implementations require the same basic algorithm. The difference between them is the number of comparisons and swaps that are involved in each operation. Merge Sort is the more efficient sorting algorithm as it requires only one pass through the input array, while Bubble Sort requires two passes. In summary, Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order, while Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two subarrays, sorts each of the subarrays recursively, and then combines them back into the original array. Both algorithms have a time complexity of O(n^2) for sorting large data sets, while Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n*log n) for sorting small data sets.
