So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

Here are the issues I found in the text:

**Grammar mistakes:**

1. "to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking)" - should be "to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers, who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking" (missing comma)
2. "it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down" - inconsistent verb tense (switching from present to future)
3. "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose" - should be "In America, we trust that they're capitalist enough not to kill their golden goose" (missing article, incorrect phrase structure)
4. "whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years" - inconsistent verb tense (switching from future to present)
5. "Those who read history knows" - subject-verb agreement error (should be "Those who read history know")

**Serious stylistic issues:**

1. Overuse of colloquial expressions and slang (e.g. "the party's gonna end sooner or later", "enshittification") - may make the text harder to understand for non-native English speakers or readers from different cultural backgrounds
2. Lack of clear structure and transitions between paragraphs - makes the text feel disjointed and hard to follow
3. Overly long sentences with multiple clauses - can be difficult to parse and understand (e.g. the second paragraph)
4. Inconsistent tone - switches between casual and serious, which can be jarring for the reader
5. Use of overly complex vocabulary and jargon (e.g. "antitrust", "monotonic-increasing") - may alienate readers who are not familiar with these terms

**Other problems:**

1. Lack of clear thesis statement or main argument - makes it hard to understand the author's main point
2. Overreliance on vague phrases and clich√©s (e.g. "ruthless capitalist engine", "True Abundance") - may come across as trite or unoriginal
3. Failure to provide concrete evidence or data to support claims - makes the text feel more like opinion than analysis
4. Use of vague pronouns (e.g. "they", "their") without clear antecedents - can cause confusion for the reader
5. Lack of clear conclusion or summary - leaves the reader feeling unsatisfied and unsure of what to take away from the text<|eot_id|>
