If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

In the context of logic and mathematics, when a theory proves itself to be self-consistent, it is typically referred to as "consistent." A consistent theory is one that does not contain any contradictions; it is impossible within the system to derive both a statement and its negation from the theory's axioms and inference rules.


On the other hand, a "tautology" is a statement that is true in every possible interpretation. It is a concept from propositional logic and is not directly related to the consistency of a logical system. However, in a sense, a set of axioms that is both consistent and tautological is very strong, but the terms are not used interchangeably.


Examples of consistent theories include:

1. Euclidean geometry: Based on Euclid's postulates, this theory is consistent within its own framework, assuming its axioms do not lead to contradictions.

2. Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the Axiom of Choice (ZFC): This is a commonly used foundational system for mathematics that is generally considered to be consistent, although its consistency has not been proven (as far as current knowledge extends).

3. Peano Arithmetic: A formal system that includes axioms defining the natural numbers, and it has been shown to be consistent relative to certain other axiomatic systems under Gödel's incompleteness theorems.


It's worth noting that proving the absolute consistency of a system is generally undecidable due to Gödel's incompleteness theorems. These theorems show that for any sufficiently expressive logical system, there are propositions that cannot be proved or disproved within the system itself.


In conclusion, when discussing a theory that proves itself, "consistent" is the appropriate term, rather than "tautological." Tautologies are truths in logic that hold under all interpretations, but consistency refers to the absence of contradictions within the theory itself.<|end|>
