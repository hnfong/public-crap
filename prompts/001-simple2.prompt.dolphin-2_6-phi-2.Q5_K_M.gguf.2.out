Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

A1: The number 120 has several interesting properties and is often referred to as the "perfect square" because it is the product of two equal integers (12 * 10 = 120). It is also the sum of the first five consecutive positive integers (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15) and the sum of the first eight consecutive positive integers (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36), among other properties. In mathematics, 120 is considered a special number due to its divisibility by many factors, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.

A2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

x = (7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18))) / 2(1)
x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± √121) / 2

Now, we can simplify the equation further:

x = (7 ± 11) / 2

This gives us two possible solutions for x:

x1 = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
x2 = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

So, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

A3: To determine the number of round trips a train can make between two cities within a full day, we need to find out how long it takes for the train to travel between the cities and back. We know that the distance between the cities is 200km, and the average speed is 60 km/h.

The time taken to travel from one city to the other would be:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 km / 60 km/h
Time ≈ 3.33 hours

Since we want to know how many round trips can be made within a full day (24 hours), we need to divide 24 by the time taken for one round trip:
Number of round trips = Total time available / Time per round trip
Number of round trips = 24 hours / 3.33 hours/round trip ≈ 7.27

Since we cannot make a fraction of a round trip, the train can make approximately 7 round trips between the two cities within a full day.
