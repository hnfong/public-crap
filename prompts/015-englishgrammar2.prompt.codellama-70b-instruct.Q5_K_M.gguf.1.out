  Here are a couple sentences in both Cantonese and English. They are written by somebody who is a native Cantonese speaker, but not necessarily good in English. Review the English translations, keeping in mind it should be simple, fluent, written like a native speaker, and to the point. If the sentence does not need changes, just output "Sentence is good as-is"; Otherwise, suggest a better sentence.

For example:

A. 啲貨咁好賣，唔使慌賺唔到錢喎。 The goods are selling so well, there's no need to fear that you cannot earn money.
B. 美國每四年會舉行一次總統選舉。 The United States holds a presidential election every four years.

Expected output:

A. Suggested sentence: The goods are selling so well, you don't need to worry about not making money.
B. Sentence is good as-is.

Here are the sentences for you to review. In your answer, give one suggested English translation per sentence, or just output "(Good translation!)" if the existing translation does not need changes.

1. 你咁趕做咩啫，你慌人哋唔等你咩？ Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?
2. 佢份人夠大量，唔同班𡃁仔計較。 He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids.
3. 學語文冇捷徑，要靠大量浸淫。 There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it.
4. 小新喺同事面前讚美女朋友有幾温柔。 Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender.
