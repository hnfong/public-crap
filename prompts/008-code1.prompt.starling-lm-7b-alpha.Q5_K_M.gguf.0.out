Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Here are the Python implementations of bubble sort and merge sort:

Bubble Sort:

```python
def bubble_sort(list_input):
    for i in range(len(list_input)-1):
        for j in range(len(list_input)-1):
            if list_input[j] > list_input[j+1]:
                list_input[j], list_input[j+1] = list_input[j+1], list_input[j]
    return list_input
```

Merge Sort:

```python
def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    left_index = 0
    right_index = 0

    while left_index < len(left) and right_index < len(right):
        if left[left_index] < right[right_index]:
            result.append(left[left_index])
            left_index += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[right_index])
            right_index += 1

    result += left[left_index:]
    result += right[right_index:]

    return result

def merge_sort(list_input):
    if len(list_input) <= 1:
        return list_input

    middle = len(list_input) // 2
    left = list_input[:middle]
    right = list_input[middle:]

    left = merge_sort(left)
    right = merge_sort(right)

    return merge(left, right)
```

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that compares each pair of adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It continues to do this until the entire list is sorted. Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the number of elements in the list.

Merge sort, on the other hand, is a divide and conquer algorithm that recursively divides the input list into smaller sublists until each sublist contains only one element. It then merges these sublists back together in a sorted manner. Merge sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case, making it much more efficient than bubble sort for larger lists.

In summary, while bubble sort is simple to understand and implement, it is not efficient for large lists. Merge sort is more efficient but has a more complex implementation. For very large lists, other algorithms like quicksort or heapsort may be even more efficient.
