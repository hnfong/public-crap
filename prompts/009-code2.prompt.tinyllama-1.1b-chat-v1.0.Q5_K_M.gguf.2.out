Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a text file, we first need to find the endpoints of the interval containing the target. The intervals can be divided into three cases:
1. Target is not present in the file: This case is handled by the `bisect_left` function. It finds the start and end indices using a binary search (in-place) and returns both.
2. Target is found at index i: This case is handled by a linear scan from 0 to I - 1, looking for the target in the range [i, n]. If the target is found, the function returns the index of the position where it was found. Otherwise, the function inserts a new element and continues the search at its next rightmost index, i+1.
3. Target is found at index I: This case can be handled by linear scanning from 0 to I - 1, looking for the target in the range [i, n]. If the target is found, the function returns the position of that element. Otherwise, it inserts a new element and continues the search at its rightmost index, I+1.
To perform binary search on the file `text_file`, we define a helper function `find_start_index` to find the start indices based on the interval containing the target. Then, we call `binary_search_file` with each line of `text_file` as a parameter, passing in their start indices as inputs. Finally, we use the results from all calls and return the maximum found index or 0 for not finding the target. The function `find_start_index` takes the first argument to be the start index (inclusive) and returns the second argument (exclusive).
Here's some pseudocode:
```python
def find_start_index(left, right):
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if target < file[mid]:
            left = mid + 1
        elif target > file[mid]:
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            return mid
    return -1  # target not found in the interval
```
Here's an implementation of `find_start_index` using recursion:
```python
def find_start_index(left, right):
    if left > right:
        return -1
    elif file[left] < target:
        return left
    else:
        return find_start_index(left + 1, right)
```
Finally, the function `binary_search_file` takes a path to the text file and a target to search for. It first checks if the file exists, reads its content (if it does), and splits it into lines with at most O(log(n)) operations using the `splitlines()` method on Python 3 or `StringIO().readlines()` on Python 2. Then, we perform the binary search in two steps:
1. For each line, we call `binary_search_file` with that line and the target as inputs, passing in their start indices as inputs.
2. We then update the start indices of all other lines based on the results from previous calls.
Finally, we return the maximum found index or 0 for not finding the target (i.e., the file is empty). Here's an example usage:
```python
import os
path = '/tmp/test-file.txt'
if not os.path.exists(path):
    print('File does not exist.')
else:
    with open(path, 'r') as f:
        target = 10
        start_indices = [i for I in range(len(f)) if f[i] == target]
        end_indices = sorted([i for I in range(len(f)) if f[i] != target])
        binary_search_file(path, target)
```
In this example, we first check that the file exists and then use it to find the index of the target.
