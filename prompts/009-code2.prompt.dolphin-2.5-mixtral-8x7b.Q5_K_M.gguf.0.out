Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

 To perform a binary search on a text file directly using at most O(log(n)) operations, we can use Python's built-in `mmap` module to map the file into memory and then access it as an array. The `mmap` module provides an interface between memory and files.

Here's a Python function that performs binary search on a given text file:

```python
import mmap
from bisect import bisect_left

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r+') as f:
        # Map the file into memory
        map = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0)
        # Convert the mapped object to a string
        content = map.read().decode('utf-8').splitlines()

    pos = bisect_left(content, target)
    return pos if pos != len(content) and content[pos] == target else pos + 1
```

In this function, we first open the file with `mmap.mmap()`. The second argument to `mmap.mmap()`, 0, means that the entire file will be mapped into memory.

Then we use `map.read().decode('utf-8').splitlines()` to read the contents of the file and split it into a list of lines.

Next, we use Python's `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to perform the actual binary search. The `bisect_left` function returns the insertion point of the target in the list. If the target is found, it returns its position; otherwise, it returns the position where the target would be inserted to maintain sorted order.

Finally, we return the result of the binary search with some modifications:
- We add 1 if the target is not found or is found at the end of the list (`pos + 1`). This is because `bisect_left` returns an insertion point before the target when it's not found, and we need to return the position after the target instead.
- We also check if the target is found but is not equal to the element at that position (`content[pos] == target`). In this case, we return the position of the target (`pos`).

This function runs in O(log(n)) time complexity since it uses binary search, and it handles both cases where the target is found or not found.
