If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

If a theory proves itself, it's actually considered tautological, not consistent. Consistency refers to a theory's ability to avoid logical contradictions or paradoxes within its own framework. Tautological, on the other hand, refers to a statement or theory that is necessarily true by definition, often because it's self-referential or circular.

Here are some examples:

1. The theory that "all bachelors are unmarried" is tautological. If we assume that "bachelor" means "unmarried man," then the statement is simply rephrasing the definition of a bachelor. It's not saying anything new or interesting, but rather repeating a well-known fact.
2. The liar paradox is a famous example of a self-referential statement that is tautological: "This sentence is false." If the sentence is true, then it must be false, but if it's false, then it must be true. This creates an infinite loop, and the sentence is essentially saying nothing meaningful.
3. The theory of first-order logic, which states that all true statements can be expressed using first-order logic, is tautological. This is because it's essentially saying that true statements can be expressed using the rules of first-order logic, which is what first-order logic is all about.
4. The theory of ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice) is often considered tautological because it's a foundational theory that defines the basic concepts of set theory. The theory is designed to be consistent, but it's not saying anything new or interesting about the world; it's simply providing a framework for talking about sets and relationships between them.

It's worth noting that while tautological theories might be uninteresting in the sense that they're not making new claims or predictions, they can still be important and useful in certain contexts. For example, the theory of ZFC provides a foundation for mathematics and has been incredibly influential in many fields, even if it's not making new predictions or claims about the world.
