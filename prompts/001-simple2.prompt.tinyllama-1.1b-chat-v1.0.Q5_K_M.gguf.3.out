1. "The meaning of the number 120" - The number 120 has no specific meaning in itself, but its properties and relationships are significant in different contexts. For example, it is often used to represent the square root of 60, which is equal to approximately 3.5.

2. To solve for x in the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we first note that the quadratic equation has only positive real solutions. This means that if x is a real number and satisfies the conditions of the equation, then it must be greater than or equal to zero (since the solution set is defined as all non-negative numbers). Therefore, since the quadratic equation has only positive real solutions, we can substitute x into the equation to eliminate negative values. This gives us:

    x^2 - 7x + 18 = 0

This shows that the discriminant, which is a number that appears in quadratic equations and measures the discrepancy between the equality conditions and the solution conditions, has value 60 (since square roots of numbers are positive).

Therefore, we can write the equation x^2 - 7x + 18 = 0 as:

    x^2 - (7/60)x + 18 = 0

This simplifies to:

    x^2 - (7/60)x = 0

The solution set is the set of all values of x where this equation has no real roots. Since it contains only positive numbers, it must contain one root, which satisfies the quadratic equation. Therefore, the solution set consists of the number 18, which has a square root of approximately 3.5.

So, we have:

    (18) = (7/60)*(x - 3.5)
    18 - 3.5 = (7/60)*(x - 3.5)
    x = 9/2 + 3.5
    9/2 + 3.5 - 3.5 = 9/2 + 3.5
    x = 10/2

Thus, the number of round trips that can be made between the two cities within a full day is:

    (18) / (9/2 + 3.5 - 3.5)
    9/2 * 6 = 18
    18

Q3. Assume train stationed in city A and takes 2 hours to travel to the nearest city B, where it stops for 10 minutes before arrival at B. The time between A and B is:

    T_A - T_B = 2 + 10 minutes
    T_A - T_B = 2 * (t_B / t_A)
    T_A - T_B = 2 * (9/4)
    T_A - T_B = 360 minutes
    360 - 2 * 360 minutes = 180 minutes
    180

Therefore, the number of round trips taken by the train in 1 hour is:

    (18) / (360 - 2 * 360 minutes)
    (18) / 180 minutes
    1.8
