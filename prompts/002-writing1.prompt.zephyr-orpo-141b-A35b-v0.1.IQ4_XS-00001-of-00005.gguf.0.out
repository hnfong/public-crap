Once upon a time, in the heart of a small town, there was a man named Jack. Jack was a hardworking man, but he had one flaw - he was always exaggerating. He would tell tall tales, boasting about his accomplishments and making up stories about his life. Despite his tendency to exaggerate, Jack was a good man at heart, always willing to lend a helping hand to those in need.

One day, while walking through the town square, Jack saw a young woman sitting on a bench, staring up at the clouds. Her face was etched with sadness, and Jack couldn't help but feel drawn to her. He approached her and asked what was wrong. The woman, whose name was Lily, told him that she had lost her job and was struggling to make ends meet. Jack, feeling sympathy for her plight, decided to offer her a place to stay in his home.

As the days passed, Jack and Lily grew closer. Jack continued to exaggerate his stories, but Lily saw through his lies and loved him anyway. She would tease him about his tall tales, calling him a "cloud-walker" because his head was always in the clouds. Jack loved Lily's sense of humor and her kind heart.

One night, as they lay on the rooftop looking up at the stars, Jack confessed his love for Lily. He told her that she was his "pillow," the one thing that made him feel safe and comfortable in the world. Lily felt the same way about Jack and confessed her love for him too.

Their love was a lesson for the townspeople, who had always seen Jack as a braggart. They realized that love was more important than any exaggerated story or accomplishment. Love was the one thing that could bring people together and make them happy, no matter what their circumstances were.

From that day on, Jack and Lily lived happily ever after, teaching everyone they met about the importance of love. They showed the world that even though Jack was a "cloud-walker," he had a heart full of love that was more valuable than any exaggerated story.
