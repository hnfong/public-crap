  Here are a couple sentences in both Cantonese and English. They are written by somebody who is a native Cantonese speaker, but not necessarily good in English. Review the English translations, and if necessary, suggest a better sentence. If the sentence does not need changes, just output "(Good translation!)"

For example:

A. 啲貨咁好賣，唔使慌賺唔到錢喎。 The goods are selling so well, there's no need to fear that you cannot earn money.
B. 美國每四年會舉行一次總統選舉。 The United States holds a presidential election every four years.

Expected output:

A. The goods are selling so well, you don't need to worry about not making money.
B. (Good translation!)

Here are the sentences for you to review. In your answer, give one suggested English translation per sentence, or just output "(Good translation!)" if the existing translation does not need changes.

1. 你咁趕做咩啫，你慌人哋唔等你咩？ Why are you in a hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?
2. 佢份人夠大量，唔同班𡃁仔計較。 He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids.
3. 學語文冇捷徑，要靠大量浸淫。 There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it.
4. 小新喺同事面前讚美女朋友有幾温柔。 Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender.
5. 我日日都搭地鐵返學。 I take the metro to school every day.

 Ah, great questions! Here are my suggestions for better translations:

1. Why are you in such a hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you? (Good translation!)
2. He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't care about petty differences with the kids. (I changed "計較" to "care", which means "to think deeply or seriously about something".)
3. There is no shortcut to learning a language; massive exposure is key. (Good translation!)
4. Siu-san praises his girlfriend's tender nature in front of his colleagues. (I changed "女朋友" to "girlfriend", and rephrased the sentence for better flow.)
5. I take the metro to school every day. (Good translation!)
