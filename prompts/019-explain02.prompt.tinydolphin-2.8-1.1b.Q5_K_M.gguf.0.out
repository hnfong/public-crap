 The National People Congress (NPC) is an important group of people from China who help make decisions for their country. It is like your school council or class president. In China, there are about 4,000 NPC members, and they meet regularly to discuss and vote on important issues like laws, policies, and charities. Just like how your school council helps you understand the importance of taking good care of yourself and others, the NPC in China helps make decisions that affect the country's life.<|im_end|>
