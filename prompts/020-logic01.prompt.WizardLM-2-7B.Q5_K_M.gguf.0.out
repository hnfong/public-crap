<s> USER: If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

ASSISTANT: 1. **Consistency**: A theory is consistent if it is free from contradictions; that is, it is not possible to deduce both a statement and its negation within the theory. Consistency is a weaker property than completeness, which would mean that for every statement either it or its negation can be proven within the theory. Gödel's incompleteness theorems show that for sufficiently powerful formal systems, it is impossible for the system to be both complete and consistent.

2. **Tautology**: In logic, a tautology is a logical formula or proposition that is true in all possible interpretations, i.e., a statement that is always true regardless of the values of the variables or the circumstances. In a theory, a tautology can be proven within the theory because it is true by definition.

When a theory proves a tautology, it is not particularly enlightening because tautologies are true by virtue of their logical form, not because of any substantive content about the world. However, if a theory can prove a non-tautological statement to be true, that is a stronger test of the theory's consistency.

**Examples of self-proving theories (axioms or frameworks)**:

1. **Peano Arithmetic (PA)**: This is an axiomatic system for the natural numbers that includes an axiom that states "0 is not a successor" (which can be formalized to prove that 0 does not have a predecessor, and thus 0 is indeed the smallest natural number). Peano Arithmetic can prove many non-tautological statements about arithmetic, but it can also prove tautologies like "if A is true, then A is true" (modus ponens).

2. **Classical Propositional Logic**: The tautology "p ∨ ¬p" (either p is true or it is not true) can be proven within the system. This is because the rules of inference in classical logic allow us to derive truths from other truths.

3. **Predicate Logic**: Similar to propositional logic, predicate logic can prove tautologies like "∀x P(x) ∨ ∃x ¬P(x)" (everything is either P or not P). It can also prove more complex statements about all instances of P(x) that are consistent with the axioms of the logic framework.

4. **Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory (ZF)**: With its axioms, ZF set theory can prove its own consistency under certain assumptions (e.g., the Regularity Axiom can be used to show that no set is both well-ordered and inductively ordered, which is a non-tautological result). However, ZF cannot prove its own consistency from within the theory (due to Gödel's second incompleteness theorem).

5. **Type Theory**: Systems like Martin-Löf's type theory can prove consistency of their own basic types by constructing models within the theory itself. For example, the type of natural numbers in type theory can be shown to be consistent with respect to certain rules of computation.

In all these cases, the theory can prove certain statements to be true, including both tautologies and non-tautological truths. The ability to prove its own consistency depends on the specific theory and the strength of its axioms. Some theories can prove their own consistency under certain assumptions, while others cannot do so due to limitations imposed by Gödel's incompleteness theorems.</s>
