 Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties:

1. It is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of three consecutive odd numbers (1 + 3 + 5 = 9, 9 * 13 = 117; 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16, 16 * 7 = 112).
2. It is a highly composite number, meaning it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer (divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120).
3. It is the smallest number that can be expressed as the product of three primes (2 * 3 * 5 = 30; 2 * 3 * 5 + 1 = 31, which is a prime number itself).
4. The sum of its proper divisors equals half its value (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 24 + 30 = 135; 135/2 = 67.5).

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)

In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

x = (7 ± sqrt((-7)^2 - 4 * 1 * (-18))) / (2 * 1)
x = (7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± sqrt(121)) / 2

The square root of 121 is 11, so we have two possible solutions:

x = (7 + 11) / 2 and x = (7 - 11) / 2

Solving for x in each case, we find that the solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: To determine how many round trips a train can make between two cities within a full day, we first need to find out how long it takes to travel between the cities. To do this, we divide the distance between the cities by the average speed of the train:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 km / 60 km/h
Time = 3.33 hours (approximately)

Since there are 24 hours in a full day, the train can make approximately (24 hours / 3.33 hours) ≈ 7 round trips within a full day.
