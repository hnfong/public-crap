Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

 To perform a binary search directly on a text file, we need to read and compare lines from the file. Python provides `with open() as file:` context manager for reading files without needing to worry about closing them. We can use this feature along with built-in functions like `len`, `readline`, `seek` for performing binary search. Here's a python function that does it:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    position = 0
    
    # Read the file into memory and sort the lines
    with open(file_path) as f:
        lines = sorted(f.readlines())
        
    low = 0
    high = len(lines) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if target == lines[mid]:
            return mid + position
        elif target < lines[mid]:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    
    return low
```

In the code above, we first read all lines from the file and sort them. Then we perform a binary search by repeatedly dividing the search space into two halves until we find the target or reach the end of the list. If the target is found at position `mid`, we return this position plus the initial offset (`position`).

This algorithm has a time complexity of O(log(n)) because it divides the search space in half with each iteration, which results in only logarithmic number of operations for large inputs.
