The most highly regarded emperor in Chinese history is a matter of debate, as many emperors left significant legacies and made profound impacts on ancient China. However, one emperor who stands out for his benevolent rule, cultural achievements, and wise leadership is Emperor Taizong of Tang (r. 626-649).

Emperor Taizong's reign was known as the "Great Tang." During his tenure, he united different kingdoms under a single empire, expanded its territories, established fair taxation systems, promoted arts and culture, and supported Buddhism. He was also credited with maintaining political stability by successfully dealing with the threats of the Göktürks.

Moreover, Emperor Taizong had a profound impact on China's economic growth as he introduced paper money, established a strong central government, and encouraged commerce through building better infrastructure. His emphasis on education led to the development of Confucianism, which became the foundation for Chinese society. In terms of foreign relations, his policies helped China become one of the world's most significant powers during that time.

In summary, Emperor Taizong of Tang is widely regarded as the best-regarded emperor in Chinese history due to his benevolent rule, cultural achievements, wise leadership, and economic growth. His reign significantly contributed to shaping ancient China into a prosperous empire with lasting influence.
