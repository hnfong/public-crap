Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

 To perform a binary search on a file directly, we need to use the Python built-in method 'seek' to navigate through the file. Here is how it can be done:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, "r") as file:
        left = 0
        right = file.tell() # Get the current position in the file
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            file.seek(mid)
            line = file.readline().strip()
            if target == line:
                return mid
            elif target < line:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        # If the element is not in the list, seek to the insertion point (bisect_left)
        file.seek(right)
        if file.readline().strip() == target:
            return right
        else:
            return right - 1
```

In this function, we open the file in read mode and use its length as the right boundary for our binary search. We then continuously move the left boundary towards the right boundary until the left boundary equals the right boundary. At each step of the binary search, we update either the right or left boundary based on whether the target is less than or greater than the current element in the file.

When the left boundary equals the right boundary, if the target is not found within the list, it means that it should be inserted before the current position. Therefore, we seek to one position before the current position and check if the target matches the next element in the file. If they are equal, return the current position (right boundary) as the insertion point; otherwise, return one position before the current position.

Note that this implementation assumes that all the lines in the file contain exactly one word each. If there are multiple words on a single line or empty lines, you will need to adapt the code accordingly.
