Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

```python
# Bubble Sort Implementation
def bubbleSort(arr):
    n = len(arr) 
    for i in range(n):
        # Last i elements are already in place so no need to check them again
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            # Swap if element found greater than next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
```
Bubble sort is a simple, yet inefficient algorithm that compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. It has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), which makes it unsuitable for large datasets. However, its simplicity makes it easy to implement.
```python
# Merge Sort Implementation
def mergeSort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        # Find the midpoint and split into two sub-lists
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left_half = arr[:mid]
        right_half = arr[mid:]
        
        # Recursively sort both halves
        mergeSort(left_half)
        mergeSort(right_half)
        
        # Merge the sorted sub-lists
        i = 0     # Initial index of left half
        j = 0     # Initial index of right half
        k = 0     # Initial index of merged list
        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
                arr[k] = left_half[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right_half[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1
        
        # Copy the remaining elements of either half, if any
        while i < len(left_half):
            arr[k] = left_half[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1
        
        while j < len(right_half):
            arr[k] = right_half[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
```
Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, sorts both of them recursively using merge sort, and then combines the sorted sublists to form a fully sorted list. It has an average time complexity of O(n log n) which makes it more efficient than bubble sort for larger datasets. However, its implementation is more complex due to the need to merge sorted sublists after recursively sorting them.
```
In summary, while both Bubble Sort and Merge Sort can be used to sort an array of elements, their efficiency differs significantly. Bubble Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) which makes it inefficient for large datasets. On the other hand, Merge Sort has a better average-case time complexity of O(n log n), making it more efficient and scalable for larger datasets. However, its implementation is more complex compared to Bubble Sort due to the need to merge sorted sublists after recursively sorting them.
