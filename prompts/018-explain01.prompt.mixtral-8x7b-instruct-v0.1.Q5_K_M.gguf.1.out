Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.
 [/INST] Aight, listen up, homie, I got a lesson for ya,
'Bout this cat called the Fed, that keeps our economy on track, ya hear?
The Federal Reserve, or just "the Fed," is like the money doctor,
Keeps an eye on inflation, and makes sure cash stays in factor.

They control the interest rates, set 'em low or high,
To keep the economy steady, so we can all live large, not shy.
When times are tough, they might give banks some extra dough,
So they can lend it out to folks like you and me, ain't that cool?

They also regulate banks, make sure they got enough funds,
To cover all their obligations, so no one gets left in the lurch, hun.
The Fed's an independent agency, not part of the government gang,
But they still work with 'em, to keep this country right on track, y'all can sang.

So next time you got cash in your pocket or credit in your card,
Remember the Federal Reserve, they helped make it all occur.
They keep our economy rollin', like a smooth beat in a rap,
Without 'em, we'd be lost and broken, like an old school trap.
