Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.


### Response:

Yo, it's like this, Fed is like the boss of all the money in the US, they manage and regulate the cash so that people can get loans and whatnot. They also keep an eye on banks to make sure they don't fail and cause a panic. It's all about keeping the economy flowing smoothly.
