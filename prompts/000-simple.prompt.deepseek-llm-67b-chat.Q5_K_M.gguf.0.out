Q1: 1+1=2
Q2: 6*7=42
Q3: 83*59=4907
Q4: 349*683=239,177
Q5: 6043*7489=4,521,075
Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22. The answer is x = (22 - 7) / 3 = 5
Q7: What is 25% of 80? The answer is 0.25 * 80 = 20
Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her a an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me? The answer is ($35 - $15) = $20
Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units. The answer is 4 * 5 = 20 units
Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have? The answer is 3 (Katherine + 2 brothers + 1 sister)
Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 ñ 4 - 1 = 3 + 8 - 1 = 5
Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need? Assuming one slice per guest, the answer is 5 slices.
Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price? The answer is ($25 * 20%) = $5 discount so the sale price is $25 - $5 = $20
Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM? There are 60-45=15 minutes in a half hour and another 30 minute interval till 6:30 so the answer is (2*15) + 30 = 60
Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people? The answer is 22 / 4 = 5 with remainder 2, so you would need 6 taxis in total (5 to transport the full groups and one more taxi to accommodate the remaining two individuals)
Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle? The sum of all three interior angles in any triangle add up to 180 degrees so the answer is (180 - 31 - 62) = 87 degrees.
