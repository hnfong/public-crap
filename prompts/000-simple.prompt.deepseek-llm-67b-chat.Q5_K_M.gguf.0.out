Q1: 1+1=?
A: 1 + 1 = 2

Q2: 6*7=?
A: 6 * 7 = 42

Q3: 83*59=?
A: 83 * 59 = 4887

Q4: 349*683=?
A: 349 * 683 = 239157

Q5: 6043*7489=?
A: 6043 * 7489 = 45266777

Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.
A: 3x + 7 = 22, subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15, divide both sides by 3: x = 5

Q7: What is 25% of 80?
A: 25% of 80 = 0.25 * 80 = 20

Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her a an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?
A: You paid a total of 2 * $20 + $5 = $45. The book cost $15, so the change is $45 - $15 = $30

Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.
A: The perimeter of a square is 4 times the side length, so the perimeter is 4 * 5 = 20 units

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?
A: Katherine has two brothers and a sister, so her mother has a total of 1 (Katherine) + 2 (brothers) + 1 (sister) = 4 children

Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 î 4 - 1
A: 12 î 4 = 4 (since î means exponentiation, and 12^4 is 12 to the 4th power, which is 12 * 12 * 12 * 12 = 12^4 = 144 * 4 = 4)
So the expression becomes: 3 + 4 - 1 = 4 + 3 = 7

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?
A: If there are 5 guests, and assuming each person needs a slice of cake, then they will need 5 slices of cake.

Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?
A: 20% off means a discount of 20% of the original price. 20% of $25 is 0.20 * $25 = $5. So the sale price is $25 - $5 = $20

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?
A: There are 60 minutes in an hour, so from 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM, there are 3 hours and 45 minutes. 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. So there are a total of 180 + 45 = 225 minutes left until 6:30 PM.

Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?
A: Each taxi can carry 4 passengers, so the number of taxis needed is 22 / 4 = 5.5. Since we can't have a fraction of a taxi, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we need 6 taxis.

Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?
A: The sum of the angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. If two angles measure 31 and 62 degrees, then the third angle is 180 - 31 - 62 = 87 degrees.
