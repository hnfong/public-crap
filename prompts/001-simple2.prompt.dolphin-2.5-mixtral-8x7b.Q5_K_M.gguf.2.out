 Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties:

1. It is a highly composite number, which means it has more divisors than any other numbers less than itself. Its divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.

2. It is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of three distinct squares (1^2 + 2^2 + 9^2 = 120). This property is connected to a famous problem in mathematics called "Waring's problem."

3. It is also the largest number that cannot be represented as the sum of distinct powers of integers greater than 1, except for its own power (i.e., 1^k + 2^k + ... + n^k, k ≥ 2). This was proven by Paul Erdős.

Q2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these values into the formula:

x = (7 ± sqrt((-7)^2 - 4*1*(-18))) / 2*1
x = (7 ± sqrt(64)) / 2
x = (7 ± 8) / 2

So, there are two possible solutions: x = 15 and x = -1.

Q3: To find how many round trips a train can make between the two cities within a full day, we first need to determine the total time available for travel. There are 24 hours in a full day, and if the stationed time is negligible, we can assume that the entire day is available for travel.

The average speed of the train is 60 km/h, so its travel time between the two cities will be:

travel_time = distance / speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3 hours and 20 minutes (approximately)

Since there are 24 hours in a full day, we can make approximately (24 hours / 3.33 hours) = 7 round trips within a full day.
