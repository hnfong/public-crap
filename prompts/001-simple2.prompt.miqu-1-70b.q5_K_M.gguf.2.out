Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?



### Response:

A1: The number 120 is significant for several reasons in mathematics:

1. It's the smallest positive integer divisible by all integers from 1 to 5. This makes it a highly composite number and abundant number.
2. In geometry, it appears as the number of sides in a regular dodecagon, the number of vertices of a regular icosahedron and dodecahedron, and the number of cells of a regular 6-simplexes (a six-dimensional shape).
3. It's also part of many interesting sequences like Fibonacci numbers where F(8) = 120 or Pell numbers where P(5) = 120.
4. There are 120 degrees in a third of a circle.

A2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use factoring, completing the square, or the quadratic formula. Here, I'll use factoring:

x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0
(x-9)(x+2) = 0

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
x - 9 = 0   => x = 9
and
x + 2 = 0   => x = -2

So, the roots of the equation are x = {-2, 9}.

A3: If a train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart, then it takes t = d/r = 200/60 = 10/3 hours for one way. Since there and back makes twice the distance, 400km, and twice the time, the round trip would take 2 * (10/3) = 20/3 hours.

In a full day of 24 hours, the train can make:
Number of trips = Total time available / Time per round trip
= (24*60)/(20/3)
= 8640/20 * 1/3
= 432 trips

However, since trains need some time to stop and start at stations, this calculation assumes that stopping times are negligible. Therefore, in reality, the train might not be able to complete 432 round trips within a day.
