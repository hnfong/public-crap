Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a file directly using at most O(log(n)) operations, you can modify the standard binary search algorithm to work with lines sorted lexicographically. Here's how:

1. Read the file and store its contents as a list of words or names in lexicographical order (depending on the format). Keep track of the total number of items read (let's call it 'n').
2. Implement the binary search function with two pointers, low and high, initially pointing to the first and last item in this sorted list respectively.
3. Calculate the mid index: `mid = (low + high) // 2`. If the target is at this position or its left side, update either low or high accordingly; if it's right, update high. This way, you maintain a binary search tree structure with balanced height.
4. Continue until low <= high or the target is found.
5. Return 'low' if the target is not found in the file (since 'low' will point to its left insertion position).

Here's the Python function implementing this approach:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        words = [word.strip() for word in f.readlines()]  # read words from file into a list

    n = len(words)
    low, high = 0, n - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if words[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif words[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:  # words[mid] > target
            high = mid - 1

    return low  # if the target is not found in the file, return its left insertion position (i.e., 'low')
```

This function reads a file line by line and stores each word into a list of words. It then performs a binary search on this sorted list using the standard algorithm, with minor modifications to handle the lexicographic order. The time complexity of this function is O(log(n)), which is well within the bounds of O(log(n)) required by the question.

To test this function, you can use the following code:

```python
target = "target_word"
file_path = "/path/to/your/file.txt"
position = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
print(f"The word '{target}' is at position {position} in the file.")
```

This code reads a text file containing names sorted lexicographically and performs a binary search for a specific target name. The `binary_search_file` function returns the index of the target name if it exists in the file, or its left insertion position if it doesn't.
