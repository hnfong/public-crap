Here are a couple sentences in both Cantonese and English. They are written by somebody who is a native Cantonese speaker, but not necessarily good in English. Review the English translations, keeping in mind it should be simple, fluent, written like a native speaker, and to the point. Rate the sentences on a scale of 1 to 5:

1: Sentence structure is confusing. Difficult to understand. Or have obvious grammatical mistakes.
2: Contains minor grammatical errors.
3: No ambiguity or mistakes, but might contain awkward phrases or expressions that sound unnatural to the native speaker.
4: Written fluently, without obvious flaws.
5: Excellent writing and style.


For example:

i. 啲貨咁好賣，唔使慌賺唔到錢喎。 The goods are selling so well, there's no need to fear that you cannot earn money.
ii. 美國每四年會舉行一次總統選舉。 The United States holds a presidential election every four years.

Expected output:

i. Rating: 3 ("there is no need to fear" can be better written as "you do not have to worry")
ii. Rating: 4 (no obvious flaws or problems)

Here are the sentences for you to review. In your answer, give the rating, optionally with comments (on the same line) in the format shown above.

A. 你咁趕做咩啫，你慌人哋唔等你咩？ Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?
B. 佢份人夠大量，唔同班𡃁仔計較。 He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids.
C. 學語文冇捷徑，要靠大量浸淫。 There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it.
D. 小新喺同事面前讚美女朋友有幾温柔。 Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender.
E. 我日日都搭地鐵返學。 I take the metro to school every day.
 [/INST]  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are my ratings and comments for the sentences:
A.  rating: 3 ("why worry" can be better written as "why be worried")
B.  rating: 4 (no obvious flaws or problems)

C.  rating: 3 ("no shortcut" can be written more naturally as "there's no quick fix")

D.  rating: 4 (fluent writing, no obvious errors)

E.  rating: 4 (simple and fluent)

Here are my ratings and comments for each sentence:

A. "Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?"
I would rate this sentence a 3 out of 5. The sentence is clear and easy to understand, but "why worry" can be a bit confusing as it is a bit of an idiomatic expression. A more natural way to express this would be "why be worried."

B. "He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids."
I would rate this sentence a 4 out of 5. The sentence is well-structured and easy to follow, with no obvious grammatical errors. However, the use of "trivial issues" could be more natural as "minor issues."

C. "There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it."
I would rate this sentence a 3 out of 5. The sentence is clear and easy to understand, but "no shortcut" could be written more naturally as "no quick fix."

D. "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender."
I would rate this sentence a 4 out of 5. The sentence is well-structured and easy to follow, with no obvious grammatical errors. The only suggestion I would make is to use "being" instead of "be" to make the sentence more natural.

E. "I take the metro to school every day."
I would rate this sentence a 4 out of 5. The sentence is simple and easy to follow, with no obvious grammatical errors.

Overall, your writing is clear and easy to understand, but there are a few areas where you can improve the naturalness and fluency of your sentences. Keep practicing and you will see improvement!
