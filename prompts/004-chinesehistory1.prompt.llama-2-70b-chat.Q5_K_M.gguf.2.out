问题：历史中的秦始皇有甚么家人？他的童年过得开心吗？

 [/INST]  Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, was born in 259 BC to King Zhao of Qin and his concubine, Lady Zhou. He had several family members, including his parents, wives, and children.

King Zhao of Qin was a powerful ruler who unified various tribes and expanded the Qin state. He was known for his military prowess and strategic thinking. Lady Zhou was a concubine of King Zhao and was known for her beauty and intelligence.

Qin Shi Huang had several wives throughout his life, but the most famous one was Empress Wu Zetian, who was also his cousin. She played a significant role in his rise to power and later became the only empress in Chinese history.

As for his childhood, it is said that Qin Shi Huang had a difficult and lonely childhood. His father was often away at war, and he was raised by his mother and tutors. He was known to be a bright and intelligent child, and he received an education in martial arts, literature, and governance.

However, Qin Shi Huang's childhood was not entirely happy. His father was known to be a strict ruler, and he was often under pressure to meet his father's expectations. Additionally, he had a difficult relationship with his younger brother, Fusu, who was also a potential heir to the throne.

Overall, Qin Shi Huang's family life was complex, and his childhood was marked by both privilege and pressure. He went on to become one of the most significant figures in Chinese history, known for his military conquests, political reforms, and famous projects such as the Great Wall and the Terracotta Army.
