Explain the role of China's National People Congress to a 5 year old child who lives in London.


### Response:

The National People's Congress (NPC) is like a big meeting of grown-ups in China who make important decisions for the country. Just like your school has a headteacher and teachers who decide what you learn, the NPC is made up of representatives from all over China who decide things like laws, policies, and even who will be the president of China. It's very important because it helps keep China running smoothly and make sure everyone is happy and safe.
