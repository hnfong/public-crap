Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties and significance in different contexts:

* It's an abundant number, meaning that the sum of its divisors (excluding itself) is greater than the number. In this case, the sum of divisors for 120 is 1+2+3+4+5+6+8+10+12+15+20+24+30+40+60 = 220.
* It's a Harshad number, meaning that it can be divided by the sum of its digits (in this case, 1+2+0=3).
* The divisors of 120 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
* It's a triangular number (the sum of the first twelve positive integers).
* In base 10, it is a semiprime or 2-almost prime because it can be factored into two distinct prime numbers: 2^3 * 3 * 5.
* There are exactly 120 ways to arrange 4 pairs of socks in a row so that each pair is next to one another at least once (according to the Twelvefold Way).
* The number has cultural significance as well; for example, the ancient Greeks considered 120 to be the perfect number because it can be divided by all numbers up to its half.

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, you can use the quadratic formula or factorize the quadratic expression:

* Factorization method: We need to find two binomials that multiply out to (x^2 - 7x - 18). They are (x-9) and (x+2), so the factorization is (x-9)(x+2)=0. Now, we can set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:
	+ x - 9 = 0 => x = 9
	+ x + 2 = 0 => x = -2
* The solutions are x=9 and x=-2.

Q3: To calculate the number of round trips, consider the total distance traveled by the train in a day (i.e., 24 hours). A round trip covers a distance equal to twice the distance between the two cities (400 km):

* The train's speed is 60 km/h, so it takes t = d/s hours for one-way travel: t=200/60 = 3.33 (approx.) hours.
* To find how many round trips the train can make in a day, divide the total time available by twice the one-way travel time: 24 / (3.33 x 2) â‰ˆ 3.57 round trips. Since you cannot have a fraction of a round trip, we round down to 3 full round trips.
