Consider the following python code:

```
def s(a):
    if len(a) <= 1: return a
    p = a[0]
    l = [x for x in a[1:] if x <= p]
    r = [x for x in a[1:] if x > p]
    return l + [p,] + r
```

What is its intended purpose? Then, please review the code, focusing on mistakes (if any), coding style, efficiency, and any other implementation details that may be of note. Finally, write a new function with all your suggested fixes/improvements, but in the Rust language (not in python).

 The given Python function is intended to sort a list in ascending order using the quicksort algorithm. However, it does not handle cases when the input list contains non-numeric elements or negative numbers.

Reviewing the code:
1. Coding style: The variable names are clear and easily understandable (`p`, `l`, `r`). However, following the Python naming convention would make them more consistent: `pivot`, `less_than_pivot`, `greater_than_pivot`.
2. Efficiency: This implementation of quicksort has an average time complexity of O(n log n), but in the worst case (when the input list is sorted or reverse-sorted) it can degrade to O(nÂ²). A more efficient approach would be to use a pivot selection method that minimizes the likelihood of such worst-case scenarios, such as choosing a random element as the pivot.
3. Error handling: The function does not handle cases when the input list contains non-numeric elements or negative numbers, which can lead to incorrect results and runtime errors.

Here's an improved version of the function that addresses these issues:

```python
def s(a):
    if len(a) <= 1: return a
    import random
    pivot_index = random.randint(0, len(a) - 1)
    pivot = a[pivot_index]
    less_than_pivot = [x for x in a if x < pivot]
    equal_to_pivot = [x for x in a if x == pivot]
    greater_than_pivot = [x for x in a if x > pivot]
    return s(less_than_pivot) + equal_to_pivot + s(greater_than_pivot)
```

Now, the Rust implementation of the improved quicksort function:

```rust
use std::cmp::Ordering;

fn partition<T: Ord>(arr: &mut [T], low: usize, high: usize) -> usize {
    let pivot = arr[high].clone();
    let mut i = low - 1;

    for j in low..high {
        if arr[j] <= pivot {
            i += 1;
            arr.swap(i, j);
        }
    }
    arr.swap(i + 1, high);
    return i + 1;
}

fn quick_sort<T: Ord>(arr: &mut [T], low: usize, high: usize) {
    if low < high {
        let pivot_index = partition(arr, low, high);
        quick_sort(arr, low, pivot_index - 1);
        quick_sort(arr, pivot_index + 1, high);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut arr = vec![9, 7, 8, 3, 5, 2];
    quick_sort(&mut arr, 0, arr.len() - 1);
    println!("{:?}", arr); // Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9]
}
```
