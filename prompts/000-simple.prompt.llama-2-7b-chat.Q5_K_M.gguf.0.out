 [/INST]  Of course! Here are the answers to the math questions you provided:
Q1: 1 + 1 = 2
Q2: 6 x 7 = 42
Q3: 83 x 59 = 4,830
Q4: 349 x 683 = 237,471
Q5: 6043 x 7489 = 4,375,433
Q6: To solve the equation 3x + 7 = 22, we need to isolate the variable x. In this case, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation, which gives us 3x = 15. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us x = 5.
Q7: 25% of 80 = 20
Q8: The final change the shopkeeper should give you is $10 (5 + $10 = $15 - $20).
Q9: The perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units is 20 units (5 x 4 = 20).
Q10: Katherine's mother has 3 children (2 brothers and a sister).
Q11: 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1 = 15
Q12: They need 6 slices of birthday cake (5 guests x 2 slices per guest = 10 slices, plus 1 extra slice for the birthday person).
Q13: The sale price of the shirt is $19 (25 x 0.8 = 19).
Q14: There are 105 minutes left until 6:30 PM (3:45 PM + 3 hours = 6:45 PM, minus the 30 minutes past the hour).
Q15: You will need 3 taxis for a group of 22 people (22 / 4 = 5.5, rounding up to 6 taxis).
Q16: The measure of the third angle in the triangle is 58 degrees (31 + 62 = 93, divided by 2 = 46.5, rounded to the nearest degree).
