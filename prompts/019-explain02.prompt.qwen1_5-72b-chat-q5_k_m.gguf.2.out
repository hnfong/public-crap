Explain the role of China's National People Congress to a 5 year old child who lives in London.

The National People's Congress (NPC) is like a big meeting in China where important people come together to talk about rules and make decisions for their country. Just like how you have class meetings at school to decide on fun activities, the NPC does something similar but for the whole of China.

These important people are called representatives, and they're kind of like helpers who listen to what regular people in China want or need. They discuss ideas, like building new schools or making sure everyone has enough food, and then they vote on these ideas to turn them into laws.

So, imagine the NPC as a giant playtime planner for China, making sure everything is fair and fun for all the kids (and grown-ups) who live there. It's a way for people in China to have their voices heard, and it helps the country run smoothly.
