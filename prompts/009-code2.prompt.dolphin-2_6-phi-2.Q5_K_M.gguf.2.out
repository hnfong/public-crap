Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

The problem requires us to perform a binary search on a sorted file. The main idea is to read the file line by line and apply the binary search algorithm to each line until we find the target or reach the end of the file. We will use at most O(log(n)) operations to achieve this, where n is the number of lines in the file.

Here's a Python function `binary_search_file` that implements this strategy:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    lines = []
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            lines.append(line)

    left, right = 0, len(lines) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if target < lines[mid]:
            right = mid - 1
        elif target > lines[mid]:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            return mid + 1

    return left + 1  # If the target is not found, return the insertion point.
```
This function reads the file line by line and appends each line to a list. The binary search algorithm then operates on this list. We start with two pointers `left` and `right`, initially at the beginning and end of the list respectively. In each iteration, we calculate the middle index and compare the target value with the value at that index. If the target is less than the value at the middle index, we move the right pointer to the left of the middle index (effectively narrowing our search space). If the target is more than the value at the middle index, we move the left pointer to the right of the middle index. This continues until the target is found or we have exhausted the list.

We return `left + 1` in case the target is not found, because binary search returns the index where the target should be inserted to maintain the sorted order if it is not already in the list.
