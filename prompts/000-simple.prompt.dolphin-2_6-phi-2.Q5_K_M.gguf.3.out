A1: 2
A2: 42
A3: 47767
A4: 23883317
A5: 40643343
A6: x = 5
A7: 20
A8: The final change should be $10. (She gave two 20-dollar bills and one 5-dollar bill, which totals to $40. She needs to give back the remaining amount of $35.)
A9: The perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units is 20 units. (All sides of a square have equal lengths.)
A10: Since Katherine has 2 brothers and 1 sister, her mother must have 3 children in total.
A11: 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5
A12: If there are 5 guests at the party, they will need 5 slices of cake (since each person needs a slice).
A13: The sale price is $20. (20% off the original price of $25 is equal to a discount of $5, making the final price $20.)
A14: There are 225 minutes left until 6:30 PM. (From 3:45 PM to 6:00 PM is 1 hour and 15 minutes, which equals 75 minutes. From 6:15 PM to 6:30 PM is another 15 minutes, giving a total of 90 minutes or 45 seconds. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the remaining time is 45 minutes or 225 minutes.)
A15: 5 taxis are needed for 22 people. (Since each taxi can carry 4 passengers, and 22 รท 4 = 5.5. Since you cannot have half a taxi, the final answer is 5.)
A16: The measure of the third angle in the triangle is 67 degrees. (The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. If two angles are 31 degrees and 62 degrees, their combined total is 95 degrees (31 + 62). Subtracting that from 180 gives us 85 degrees for the third angle (180 - 95 = 85).)
