Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

Yo, it's the Fed, the big boss bank,

Controls the cash, makes the economy bank.

Money supply, interest rates, they tweak it,

Inflation, unemployment, they keep an eye on it.


They got the tools, they play the game,

Adjust the flow, keep the economy tame.

Bailouts, loans, they fix the blues,

When the streets get rough, they lay down some clues.


So when you're dropping those sick bars,

Remember the Fed, the money czar.

Keeping it real, but also the economy tight,

They're the unseen crew, the financial knight.<|end|>
