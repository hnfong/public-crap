Here are a couple sentences in both Cantonese and English. They are written by somebody who is a native Cantonese speaker, but not necessarily good in English. Review the English translations, keeping in mind it should be simple, fluent, written like a native speaker, and to the point. Rate the sentences on a scale of 1 to 5:

1: Sentence structure is confusing. Difficult to understand. Or have obvious grammatical mistakes.
2: Contains minor grammatical errors.
3: No ambiguity or mistakes, but might contain awkward phrases or expressions that sound unnatural to the native speaker.
4: Written fluently, without obvious flaws.
5: Excellent writing and style.


For example:

i. 啲貨咁好賣，唔使慌賺唔到錢喎。 The goods are selling so well, there's no need to fear that you cannot earn money.
ii. 美國每四年會舉行一次總統選舉。 The United States holds a presidential election every four years.

Expected output:

i. Rating: 3 ("there is no need to fear" can be better written as "you do not have to worry")
ii. Rating: 4 (no obvious flaws or problems)

C. This sentence talks about a girlfriend praising her boyfriend for his behavior towards her. It's unclear what the key points are and might not make sense to native speakers either.
D. The sentence about the girlfriend being very tender is hard to understand, especially given that it doesn't seem to be related to any topic or context.
E. This sentence talks about someone taking the metro every day to school. It seems like a typical Cantonese conversation and might be easier to understand for native speakers.<|im_end|>
