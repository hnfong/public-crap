This image appears to be from a modded version of the game **Minecraft**, specifically showcasing a user interface element that lists various items or resources. The items listed have names and quantities, and the overall design is consistent with the modded inventory screens often seen in Minecraft with mods like **Thaumcraft**, **Tinkers' Construct**, or similar resource management mods.

### Key Observations:
1. **Items Listed:**
   - **Illusion Dust (10)**
   - **Small Radiant Shard (10)**
   - **Aquamarine**
   - **Lesser Nether Essence**
   - **Dream Dust (10)**

2. **Item Icons:**
   - Each item has a distinct icon next to its name, which is typical in Minecraft mods for identifying different resources or materials.
   - The icons have a pixelated, blocky appearance, consistent with Minecraft's art style.

3. **Color Coding:**
   - Some item names are color-coded:
     - **Small Radiant Shard** is highlighted in **blue**, possibly indicating a special property or category.
     - **Aquamarine** is in **green**, which might signify a mineral or gemstone.
     - **Lesser Nether Essence** is in **green**, possibly indicating a magical or elemental essence.
     - **Dream Dust** is in **white**, which could signify a mystical or dream-related resource.

4. **Background and Layout:**
   - The background is dark, with a grid-like pattern that resembles the typical Minecraft inventory or modded interface.
   - The items are listed in a vertical column, which is standard for inventory screens.

### Possible Mod:
Given the names of the items and the overall design, this is likely from a mod that adds new resources, materials, or magical elements to Minecraft. Some potential mod sources include:
- **Thaumcraft**: Known for adding magical elements, essences, and resources.
- **Tinkers' Construct**: Adds various materials and tools.
- **Botania**: Adds magical items and resources like "Dream Dust."
- **Aurelium Creatio**: A mod that adds a variety of new materials, including essences and magical items.

### Conclusion:
This image is from a **Minecraft** modded inventory screen, displaying a list of custom items or resources. The specific mod is not explicitly identifiable from the image alone, but it could be related to mods
