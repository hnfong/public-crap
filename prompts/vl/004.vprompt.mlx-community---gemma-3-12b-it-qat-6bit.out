Here's a description of the image, including likely location and how it was taken:

**Description:**

The image is a breathtaking view of the night sky and Earth's horizon, taken from a high altitude. 

*   **Sky:** The upper portion of the image is dominated by a deep, dark blue sky densely populated with countless stars. The density of stars suggests a very dark, clear night.
*   **Earth's Horizon:** A vibrant, blue-green glow defines the Earth's horizon. This is the atmospheric glow caused by sunlight scattering off the gases in the Earth's atmosphere.
*   **Clouds:** Below the glow, a thick layer of clouds blankets the Earth, creating a textured, almost undulating landscape.
*   **Airplane Element:** In the lower left corner, a portion of an airplane wing and window are visible, confirming the perspective.

**Where and How it was Taken:**

*   **Location:** This photo was almost certainly taken from an airplane flying at a very high altitude, likely cruising altitude (around 30,000-40,000 feet).
*   **How:**
    *   **Long Exposure:** The image was likely taken with a long exposure to capture the faint light from the stars.
    *   **Stabilization:** The airplane's stabilization systems would have been crucial to prevent blurring during the long exposure.
    *   **Camera:** A DSLR or mirrorless camera with a wide-angle lens would have been used to capture the expansive view.
    *   **Window:** The photo was taken through an airplane window.
