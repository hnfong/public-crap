Certainly! Let's break down the image.

**Description:**

The image shows a portion of an inventory or resource management screen. It features a vertical list of items, each displayed in a rectangular tile with a green border. Each tile contains an icon representing an item and its name below. The items listed appear to be magical or alchemical substances, with names like "Illusion Dust," "Small Radiant Shard," "Aquamarine," and "Dream Dust." Some items have numbers associated with them, likely indicating quantity.

**Program/App:**

Based on the visual style, icons, and the nature of the items, this is very likely from the game **Diablo III**. The inventory UI and item design are characteristic of the game.
