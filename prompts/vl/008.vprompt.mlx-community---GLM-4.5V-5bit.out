Prompt: [gMASK]<sop><|user|>
<|begin_of_image|><|image|><|end_of_image|>Transcribe the Chinese text verbatim from the image. Only the text. Do not explain or elaborate.<|assistant|>

<think>The user wants me to transcribe the Chinese text from the image exactly as it appears. I need to carefully read the handwritten text and ensure I capture all characters accurately, including any possible typos or unique characters in the original handwriting.

Looking at the image, I can see this is a handwritten Buddhist text, likely from the Heart Sutra. I need to carefully transcribe each character as written, even if there are some characters that might be slightly messy.

The text appears to be the Heart Sutra (心经) with some variations in the handwriting. I'll go line by line to ensure I capture the exact characters as they appear in the image.

I'll start from the top and work my way down, making sure to capture each character precisely as written, including any potential variations in the handwriting.

The text starts with "摩訶薩若波羅蜜多故" and continues with Buddhist script. I'll transcribe each line carefully, noting any potential character variations in the handwriting.

The text contains some characters that might be slightly messy or have minor variations from standard print versions. I'll focus on capturing the exact characters as they appear in the image.

I'll proceed systematically, line by line, to ensure accuracy in my transcription.</think>
