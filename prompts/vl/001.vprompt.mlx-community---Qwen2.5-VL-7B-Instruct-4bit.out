The image appears to be a screenshot from the game "The Elder Scrolls Online." The specific interface shown is likely from the "Alchemy" or "Crafting" menu, where players can manage their alchemical ingredients. The items listed are types of alchemical dusts and essences, which are used in crafting potions and other alchemical items in the game. The presence of numbers next to each item, such as "10" next to "Illusion Dust" and "Dream Dust," suggests they might be part of a collection or inventory system within the game. The style and layout are consistent with the user interface of "The Elder Scrolls Online."
