Okay, let's analyze why there are so many question marks on this Hong Kong restaurant receipt. Here's a plausible explanation, broken down into likely causes and considerations:

**Likely Explanation: Thermal Printer Malfunction & Language/Translation Issues**

The most probable reason is a malfunction of the thermal printer used to generate the receipt. Here's how it would likely unfold:

1. **Thermal Printer Issues:** Thermal printers, especially older or lower-quality ones, can sometimes produce random characters or symbols due to a few issues:
    *   **Heat Sensitivity:** The printing process relies on heat to darken the thermal paper. Fluctuations in heat or a worn-out print head can cause unintended marks.
    *   **Paper Quality:**  Cheap or damaged thermal paper can also lead to printing errors.
    *   **Print Head Dirt/Damage:** A dirty or damaged print head will produce inconsistent printing.
2. **Language and Character Encoding:** The receipt appears to be printed in a mix of Chinese (Traditional) and English. This introduces another layer of complexity:
    *   **Character Encoding Errors:** The printer may be having trouble correctly encoding the Chinese characters, leading to the question marks appearing in place of the characters. This is more likely if the printer's settings aren't perfectly aligned with the encoding used by the restaurant's point-of-sale (POS) system.
    *   **Partial Characters:** The question marks might represent incomplete or corrupted Chinese characters.

**Why the Question Marks Specifically?**

*   The question mark character is often used as a "placeholder" or "error symbol" when a printer can't render a specific character correctly.  It's a common fallback.

**Other Considerations (Less Likely, but Possible):**

*   **Intentional Placeholder:** It's *highly unlikely* but *possible* that the restaurant is using the question marks as placeholders for items they're still working on adding to their menu.  However, this is not a standard practice.
*   **Software Glitch:** A glitch in the restaurant's POS system could be sending incorrect data to the printer, resulting in the question marks.



**In conclusion, the most plausible explanation is a combination of a faulty thermal printer and potential character encoding issues related to the mixed language on the receipt.**
