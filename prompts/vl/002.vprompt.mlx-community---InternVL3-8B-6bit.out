**Location:**
- **Snowdin:** The scene is set in Snowdin, a snowy, mountainous region in the game. The environment includes frozen trees, rocky paths, and a cold, wintery atmosphere, fitting the region's theme.

**Characters:**
- **Stitches:** 
  - **Appearance:** Stitches is a large, stitched-together monster with a somewhat grotesque and stitched appearance. He has a patchwork of flesh tones and is adorned with various stitches and patches. His face is stitched, and he has a somewhat friendly but quirky demeanor.
  - **Role:** In the game, Stitches is a recurring character who provides gifts to the protagonist. He is known for his stitched-together body and often gives gifts that the player can choose to accept or reject.

- **The Protagonist (Sans):**
  - **Appearance:** The character in the image appears to be Sans, the protagonist of "Undertale." Sans is a muscular, stone-like character with a dark, rocky texture. He has a confident and laid-back attitude.
  - **Role:** Sans is the main character of the game, known for his strength and laid-back personality. He is one of the playable characters and is part of the Papyrus, Sans, and Chara trio. Sans is known for his strength and often provides comedic relief in the game.

**Interaction:**
