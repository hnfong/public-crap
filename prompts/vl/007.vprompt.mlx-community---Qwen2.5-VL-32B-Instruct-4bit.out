This is a receipt from a restaurant in Hong Kong. Give a plausible explanation of why there are so many question marks on the paper.<|vision_start|><|image_pad|><|vision_end|><|im_end|>

The receipt in question contains numerous question marks (`?`) in several places, particularly in the item descriptions. Here is a plausible explanation for why this might be the case:

### 1. **Character Encoding or Font Issues**
   - The receipt printer may have encountered issues with character encoding or font compatibility. If the restaurant's system uses a custom font or a non-standard character set, and the printer is unable to render certain characters correctly, it may substitute them with question marks (`?`). This is a common issue when there is a mismatch between the encoding used by the system and the printer's capabilities.

### 2. **Data Entry or System Glitch**
   - There could be a bug or glitch in the restaurant's point-of-sale (POS) system or printer software. If the system fails to retrieve or display certain menu item names correctly, it may default to showing question marks as a placeholder for missing or unrecognizable data.

### 3. **Menu Item Customization**
   - The question marks could indicate that the items on the receipt were customized or special orders that did not correspond to a standard menu item. In such cases, the system may not have a predefined name for the item, leading to the use of question marks as a generic placeholder.

### 4. **Printer Malfunction**
   - The printer itself may be malfunctioning or have a faulty print head. This could result in the printer being unable to print certain characters, defaulting to question marks as a replacement.

### 5. **Database or Backend Issue**
   - There might be an issue with the restaurant's database or backend systems. If the database does not have the correct information for certain menu items or if there is a mismatch between the database and the POS system, it could lead to the display of question marks.

### 6. **Testing or Debugging Mode**
   - The receipt might have been printed during a testing or debugging phase of the system. In such cases, question marks could be intentionally used as placeholders to indicate incomplete or unverified data.

### 7. **Character Replacement**
   - Some special characters or symbols in the menu item names may not be supported by the printer or the POS system. When such characters are encountered, they might be replaced with question marks.

### 8. **Security or Privacy Measures**
   - In some cases, question marks might be used intentionally to obscure sensitive or confidential information, such as item descriptions or special instructions, for security or
