Prompt: User: <image>
Describe this image. What is the caption text referring to? Explain with reference to popular culture or memes.
Assistant:

The image shows a set of four books titled "History of the Inquisition of Spain" by Lea. The volumes are I, II, III, and IV. The caption text "Didn't expect to find this here" implies surprise at encountering such an academic and historical work in an unexpected place, likely a humorous or ironic context.

This type of caption is common in memes, often used to humorously express surprise or disbelief at finding something as serious or obscure as these books in an unexpected setting, like a casual environment or an unconventional collection. It plays on the contrast between the weighty, academic nature of the books and the casual or unexpected context where they are found.
