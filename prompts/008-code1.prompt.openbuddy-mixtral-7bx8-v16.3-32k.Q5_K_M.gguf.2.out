Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Here is an example of a bubble sort algorithm in Python:
```python
def bubbleSort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    
    for i in range(n):
        
        # Last i elements are already in place
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
```
Here is an example of a merge sort algorithm in Python:
```python
def mergeSort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        
        # Find the midpoint and split into two arrays
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left_half = arr[:mid]
        right_half = arr[mid:]
        
        # Recursively sort both halves
        mergeSort(left_half)
        mergeSort(right_half)
        
        i, j, k = 0, 0, 0
        
        # Merge the two sorted arrays into one final array
        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
                arr[k] = left_half[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right_half[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1
        
        # Handle the remaining elements in either half if there are any
        while i < len(left_half):
            arr[k] = left_half[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1
        
        while j < len(right_half):
            arr[k] = right_half[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
```
Bubble sort works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This means that for each iteration, all of the largest unsorted elements will "bubble" up to their correct position at the end of the array. However, this algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2) and is not very efficient for large datasets.

Merge sort works by dividing the input into smaller sub-arrays, recursively sorting each sub-array, and then merging them back together in sorted order. This means that it can efficiently handle large datasets with a time complexity of O(n log n). However, this algorithm requires additional memory to store the sub-arrays during the merge process.

In general, bubble sort is simpler to implement but less efficient than merge sort for larger arrays. Bubble sort also has a best case time complexity of O(n) if the input array is already sorted or nearly sorted. On the other hand, merge sort consistently provides faster sorting times on large arrays and maintains its efficiency even in worst-case scenarios. However, it requires additional memory to store the sub-arrays during merging.
