Explain the role of China's National People Congress to a 5 year old child who lives in London.


### Response:

The National People Congress is like a big family meeting that all Chinese people go to. They meet once every few years to talk about how China should be run and to make changes to the laws if they need to. It's important because it makes sure everyone stays safe and happy, just like when you have a family meeting to decide what you want for dinner!
