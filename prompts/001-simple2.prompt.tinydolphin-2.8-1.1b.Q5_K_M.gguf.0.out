Give the answer for all these questions. Provide steps. If you are not sure about the answer, you can say "I am not sure, but I think the answer is ..."

Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

 Step 1: To solve Q1, we need to find the number of integer values of x that satisfy the equation. We can use the quadratic formula and the property of integer solutions:

x = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)

where a, b, and c are given in the question. For our equation to be positive, we need a > 0 and b^2 - 4ac < 0.

We can start by testing all possible values of a:

a = 1, 2, ..., 20 (not all integer values)
b = -b1 / 2a, where b1 is the coefficient of x in the equation for x^2 = 0. We have four cases with b1 = 0.

x1 = -b1 / 2a
x1 = 0

x2 = (-b1 / 2a - sqrt(b1^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)
x2 = -1.5 + sqrt(3.5 * a^2 - 4 * 20 * a / (2a))

Now we can try other values of b:

x3 = (-b2 + sqrt(b2^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)
x3 = -1.5 + sqrt(3.5 * (20^2 - 4(20)(20 * a / (2a))) / (4 * (20 * a / (2a))))

x4 = (-b3 + sqrt(b3^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)
x4 = -1.5 + sqrt(3.5 * ((-20)^2 - 4(-20)(-20 * a / (2a))) / (4 * (-20 * a / (2a))))

Now we can see that x3 and x4 are positive integers for all given values of b.

Step 2: For the train problem, let's assume there are 10 round trips between cities A and B in a day. To find out how many such trips can be made within a full day, we will divide the total distance by the time taken for one round trip (2 hours).

So, in 24 hours, there should be 5 * 2 = 10 round trips between cities A and B. Therefore, there are 10 / 2 = 5 integer solutions for x, which satisfies the equation in Q1.

Step 3: We can use this information to solve Q2:

The equation is: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

We have the solutions from Step 2, and we want to find the smallest integer value of x that satisfies the equation. We can use the quadratic formula again:

x = (-b + sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)

For the given values of a, b, and c, we get a = 0, b^2 - 4ac < 0, and a = -1.5. So we can start by testing the solution x1 = -1.5:

x1 = -1.5 + sqrt(3.5 * (-1)^2 - 4(-1)(-1)^/a / (4 * (-1)(-1)))
x1 = -1.5 + sqrt(3.5 * (-8 - 4(2) / a) / (4 * (-1)(-1)))
x1 = -1.5 + sqrt(3.5 * (16 - 12(2) / a) / (4 * (-1)(-1)))

Now we can test x2, x3 and x4:

x2 = -1.5 + sqrt(3.5 * (-8 - 4(2) / a) / (4 * (-1)(-1)))
x2 = -1.5 + sqrt(3.5 * (16 - 12(2) / a) / (4 * (-1)(-1)))

x3 = -1.5 + sqrt(3.5 * ((-8)^2 - 4(-8)(-8/a) / (4 * (-1)(-1))) / (4 * (-1)(-1)))
x3 = -1.5 + sqrt(3.5 * (16 - 8(2) / a) / (4 * (-1)(-1)))

x4 = -1.5 + sqrt(3.5 * ((-8)^2 - 4(-8)(-8/a) / (4 * (-1)(-1))) / (4 * (-1)(-1)))
x4 = -1.5 + sqrt(3.5 * (16 - 8(2) / a) / (4 * (-1)(-1)))

As we can see, x2 and x3 are positive integer solutions for x in Q2 within a full day. However, the trains have to travel between cities A and B within one day, which means x3 should be less than or equal to 10 (the number of round trips). Therefore, the integer solution for x is x = 5.

The last step is to find out how many round trips there are in a day between cities A and B if they only travel within one day. We will divide the distance by the time taken for one round trip (2 hours) and multiply the result by the number of round trips.

10 / 2 = 5 integer solutions for x, which satisfies the equation in Q1.<|im_end|>
