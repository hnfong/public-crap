Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.


### Response:

The given program will never print "Done" for any positive input value of `inc`. This is because the variable `x` will keep increasing with each iteration, and it will never reach infinity as long as `inc` is a positive finite number.

However, if we allow negative inputs for `inc`, then there are at least two examples where "Done" will be printed:

1. If `inc = -1e-6`, the program will run for approximately 1 million iterations before reaching infinity and printing "Done". This is because each time `x` is incremented by `-1e-6`, it gets closer to negative infinity, which is not equal to positive infinity. Therefore, at some point, `x` will become negative enough that adding `-1e-6` to it will cause an overflow and result in a value of `inf`.
2. If `inc = -math.inf`, the program will immediately print "Done" on the first iteration because `x + math.inf` is equal to `math.inf`.

Note that in practice, inputting `-math.inf` directly may not be possible depending on the implementation of the input function. However, it serves as a theoretical example where "Done" will be printed.
