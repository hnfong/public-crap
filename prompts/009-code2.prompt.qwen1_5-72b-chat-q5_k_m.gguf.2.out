Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

Binary search is an efficient searching algorithm for sorted data. When it comes to files, we can perform a binary search directly on the file, but we need to keep in mind a few things:

1. We can't load the entire file into memory, so we'll read the file line by line.
2. Each read operation will move the read pointer of the file object, which can be used as our "position" in the sorted list.

The key idea is to repeatedly divide the search interval in half. At each step, compare the target with the middle element (in this case, the middle line). If the target matches the middle element, we're done. If the target is less than the middle element, repeat the search on the lower half. Otherwise, repeat it on the upper half.

Here's a Python function that implements binary search for a file:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        low = 0
        high = sum(1 for _ in file) - 1

        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            file.seek(mid * (len(target) + 1))  # Assuming each line is roughly the length of 'target' plus a newline character

            middle_line = file.readline().strip()
            if middle_line == target:
                return mid
            elif middle_line > target:
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                low = mid + 1

    # If not found, return the insertion point (like bisect_left)
    return low


# Example usage
file_path = 'sorted_names.txt'
target = 'John Doe'
position = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
print(f"Target '{target}' is at position {position}")
```

This function reads the file once to get the total number of lines (O(n) operation), but subsequent searches will be O(log n). Note that this implementation assumes each line is roughly the length of `target` plus a newline character. If your lines vary greatly in length, you might need to seek further back or forward to find the middle line accurately.

Additionally, it's important to note that seeking and reading from a file is generally slower than operations on in-memory data structures like lists. Therefore, if performance is crucial, consider loading the entire file into memory first (if possible) and then performing binary search on the loaded data.
