问题：历史中的秦始皇有甚么家人？他的童年过得开心吗？

 [/INST]  Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, was born as Ying Zheng in 259 BC. His father was King Zhao of Qin, and his mother was Queen Xia. He had several siblings, including an older half-brother named Fusu, who was born to Queen Xia's previous husband.

There is not much information available about Qin Shi Huang's childhood, but it is known that he ascended to the throne at a young age after his father's death in 246 BC. He was only 13 years old at the time and ruled under the regency of his mother and Prime Minister Li Si until he came of age.

It is difficult to say whether Qin Shi Huang's childhood was happy or not, as historical records are limited. However, it is known that he was heavily influenced by Legalist philosophy and was driven by a desire for power and prestige from an early age. He was also known to be ruthless and ambitious, which may suggest that his upbringing was focused on preparing him for leadership and instilling in him the values of strength and authority.

It is worth noting that Qin Shi Huang's reign was marked by significant political and military achievements, including the unification of China under a single ruler for the first time in history. However, his rule was also marked by brutality and oppression, and he is often criticized for his extreme policies and actions, such as the burning of books and the burying alive of scholars.
