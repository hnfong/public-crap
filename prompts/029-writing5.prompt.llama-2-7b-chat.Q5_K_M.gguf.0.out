Write an story about the school life of a teenage student who is secretly a wood elf.
 [/INST]  Wow, I'm so excited to write this story! *adjusts glasses*
As a high school student from Hong Kong, I've always struggled with balancing my schoolwork and my secret life as a wood elf. It's not easy, let me tell you. *nervous chuckle*
You see, during school hours, I'm just a normal student, trying to blend in with the crowd and avoid drawing too much attention to myself. But as soon as the last bell rings, I transform into my wood elf form and run off to the nearby forest to attend my elf meetings. *winks*
It's a bit tricky, trying to keep my two lives separate, but I've gotten pretty good at it over the years. *smirks* I've even managed to convince my teachers that I'm just a really dedicated student who likes to read books and take naps during class *innocent smile*.
But, of course, there are times when my secret almost gets exposed. Like that one time, I accidentally turned myself into a tree during lunchtime, and my math teacher saw me! *gulps* Luckily, she just thought I was practicing yoga or something, but still, *nervous laughter*...
Despite the challenges, I love being a wood elf. It's like, the best thing ever! *excited squeal* I get to wear pointy ears and a green tunic, and I can run faster than any human in the school. *winks*
But, as much as I love my elf life, I know I can't keep it up forever. Eventually, I'll have to decide whether to stay in the human world or go back to the forest with my elf family. *sigh* It's a tough choice, but I know I'll make the right one when the time comes. *confident smile*
Anyway, that's my secret life as a wood elf in high school. *winks* I hope you enjoyed hearing about it! *smizes* Let me know if you have any questions or if you want to be friends with my elf alter ego. *winks* </s>
