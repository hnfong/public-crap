Here's the implementation of the `realpath()` function:

```bash
function realpath() {
    python3 -c "import os, sys; print(os.path.realpath(sys.argv[1]))" "$1"
}
```

This uses Python's `os.path.realpath()` function to resolve the absolute path of the given file or directory, which is what the `realpath` command typically does in Unix-like systems. The function takes a path as an argument and returns its resolved absolute path. [end of text]
