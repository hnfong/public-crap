Looking at the requirements, I need to create a function that converts integers to a compact human-readable format with:
- Significant digits (rounded)
- Order of magnitude suffix (K, M, etc.)
- Maximum 4 characters in output

Let me break down the approach:
1. Handle numbers < 1000 (just return as string)
2. For larger numbers, use suffixes: K (thousands), M (millions), B (billions), etc.
3. Round to 1-2 significant digits
4. Ensure output is <= 4 characters

The pattern is:
- 1-999: just the number
- 1000-999,999: round to 1-2 digits + "K"
- 1,000,000-999,999,999: round to 1-2 digits + "M"
- 1,000,000,000-999,999,999,999: round to 1-2 digits + "B"

I'll use a loop to handle different scales and format the output appropriately.

```python
def abbrev_num(x):
    if x < 1000:
        return str(x)
    
    # Define suffixes and their thresholds
    suffixes = ['', 'K', 'M', 'B', 'T']
    suffix_index = 0
    
    # Scale the number down
    num = float(x)
    while num >= 1000 and suffix_index < len(suffixes) - 1:
        num /= 1000
        suffix_index += 1
    
    # Format to 1-2 significant digits
    if num < 10:
        result = f"{num:.1f}"
    else:
        result = f"{num:.0f}"
    
    # Remove trailing zeros if needed
    result = result.rstrip('0').rstrip('.')
    
    # Ensure we don't exceed 4 characters
    suffix = suffixes[suffix_index]
    if len(result) + len(suffix) > 4:
        # If we need to truncate, we might need to adjust
        # But the problem says "roughly" so we can use the rounded value
        # The examples show rounding, so we'll keep the rounded value
        pass
    
    return result + suffix
```

Wait, let me reconsider the rounding logic. Looking at the examples:
- 8180 => 8.2K (not 8K)
- 9385832 => 9.4M (not 9M)

So we need to show one decimal place when the number is between 1-10, and no decimal when >= 10.

Let me refine:

```python
def abbrev_num(x):
    if x < 1000:
        return str(x)
    
    # Define suffixes and their thresholds
    suffixes = ['', 'K', 'M', 'B', 'T']
    suffix_index = 0
    
    # Scale the number down
    num = float(x)
    while num >= 1000 and suffix_index < len(suffixes) - 1:
        num /= 1000
        suffix_index += 1
    
    # Format to 1-2 significant digits
    if num < 10:
        result = f"{num:.1f}"
    else:
        result = f"{num:.0f}"
    
    # Remove trailing zeros if needed
    result = result.rstrip('0').rstrip('.')
    
    # Ensure we don't exceed 4 characters
    suffix = suffixes[suffix_index]
    if len(result) + len(suffix) > 4:
        # This shouldn't happen with our rounding logic, but just in case
        # We'll use the rounded value as is
        pass
    
    return result + suffix
``` [end of text]
