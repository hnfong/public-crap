Looking at this problem, I need to perform a binary search on a file without loading it entirely into memory. The key insight is to work with byte positions and read lines at specific positions.

Let me break down the approach:

1. **Get file size**: Determine the total size to establish search boundaries
2. **Binary search on byte positions**: Instead of searching array indices, search byte positions
3. **Find complete lines**: When jumping to a byte position, I need to find the start of the line containing that position
4. **Compare with target**: Extract and compare the actual line content

Here's my solution:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    """
    Perform binary search on a file to find the byte position of target line
    or the insertion point.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the text file
        target: Target string to search for (as bytes)
    
    Returns:
        Byte position of the target line or insertion point
    """
    
    def get_line_at_pos(file, pos):
        """Get the complete line that contains the byte position 'pos'"""
        # Move to the position
        file.seek(pos)
        
        # If we're not at the beginning of the file, 
        # move backwards to find the start of the line
        if pos > 0:
            # Move backwards until we find a newline or reach the beginning
            while pos > 0:
                file.seek(pos - 1)
                char = file.read(1)
                if char == b'\n':
                    break

            file.seek(pos)

```

Let me trace through the example:
- File content: "1 I go to school\n2 by bus\nfoo bar\nhello world\nzoo zoo zoo\n"
- Target: b"2 by"
- We want to return 17, which is the byte position where "2 by bus" starts

The key insight is that we're doing binary search on byte positions, but we need to ensure we're always comparing complete lines. When we jump to a middle byte position, we first find which line contains that byte, then compare the entire line with our target. [end of text]
