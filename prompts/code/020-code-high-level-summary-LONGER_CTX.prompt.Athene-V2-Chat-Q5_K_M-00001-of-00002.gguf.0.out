This source code file is part of a system for managing and displaying multilingual dictionary entries, particularly for Cantonese and other Chinese dialects. Here's a high-level overview of what it does:

1. **Tag Management**: The file defines and manages a set of tags that can be used to annotate dictionary entries. These tags include part-of-speech (POS), labels (like "slang" or "vulgar"), synonyms, antonyms, references, and image links. It also provides aliases for these tags to make them more user-friendly.

2. **Validation**: It includes functions to validate the tags and their values, ensuring that the data entered is correct and consistent. For example, it checks if a part-of-speech tag is valid and if a URL is correctly formatted.

3. **Parsing**: The file contains classes and methods to parse and structure dictionary entries. These entries can include explanations, examples, and pronunciations in multiple languages. The parsing logic handles different formats and ensures that the data is organized correctly.

4. **Multilingual Support**: It supports multilingual entries, allowing explanations and examples to be provided in different languages. The system can handle language codes and automatically detect the language of the text if not explicitly specified.

5. **Formatting and Serialization**: The file provides methods to format and serialize the parsed data. This includes generating HTML for display, ensuring that links and special characters are handled correctly, and converting the data to JSON for API responses.

6. **Error Handling**: It defines custom error classes to handle various issues that might arise during parsing, such as invalid tags, missing required fields, or incorrect pronunciations.

7. **Utility Functions**: It includes utility functions for tasks like checking the validity of Jyutping (Cantonese pronunciation), formatting explanations, and handling language codes.

In summary, this file is a crucial component of a dictionary management system, responsible for ensuring that dictionary entries are well-structured, validated, and can be displayed correctly in a multilingual context. [end of text]
