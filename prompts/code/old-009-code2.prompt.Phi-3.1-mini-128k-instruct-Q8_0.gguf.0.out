 To perform a binary search on a text file with names sorted in lexicographical order, we need to read the file in a way that allows us to access the middle elements efficiently. Since we can't directly access elements in a file like an array, we'll read the file in chunks and perform binary search on these chunks.

Here's a Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Read the first line to get the total number of names
        total_names = int(file.readline().strip())

        # Initialize the search range
        left, right = 0, total_names - 1

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            # Read the middle line
            file.seek(mid * 1024)  # Assuming each line is 1024 bytes
            middle_name = file.readline().strip()

            if middle_name == target:
                return mid
            elif middle_name < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1

        # If the target is not found, return the insertion point
        return left

# Example usage:
# Assuming the file 'names.txt' contains the sorted names
position = binary_search_file('names.txt', 'Alice')
print(f"Position of 'Alice': {position}")
```

This function assumes that each line in the file is exactly 1024 bytes long, which is a common line length for text files. If the line length varies, you'll need to adjust the `file.seek()` and `file.readline()` calls accordingly.

Please note that this approach reads the file multiple times, which may not be the most efficient for very large files. If performance is a concern, you might want to consider reading the file into memory first (if it fits) and then performing a binary search on the in-memory data. However, this would require O(n) memory usage, which might not be feasible for very large files.

For extremely large files, a more sophisticated approach would involve using a database or a specialized search algorithm that can handle large datasets more efficiently, possibly with external sorting and indexing techniques. [end of text]
