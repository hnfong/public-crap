This source code file is a Python class that defines a class called "Multilingual" that
uses a list of words to represent the language of the text. The class has a method called "encode"
that encodes the text into a list of words. The method takes a string as input and returns a list
of words. The method also takes a list of words as input and returns the list of words as output.

The class also has a method called "decode" that decodes the list of words back into a string.

The class also has a method called "encode_word" that encodes a word into a list of words.

The class also has a method called "encode_word_with_trailing_space" that encodes a word into a list of
words by adding a trailing space to the word.

The class also has a method called "decode_word" that decodes the list of words back into a string.
