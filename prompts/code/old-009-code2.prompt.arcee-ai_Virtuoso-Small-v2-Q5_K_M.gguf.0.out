To perform a binary search on a text file directly, we need to read the file in chunks and compare the middle element of the chunk with the target. We can use the `seek` method to move the file pointer to the middle of the chunk and read the line at that position. We can then compare the line with the target and decide whether to search in the left or right half of the chunk.

Here is a Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Get the size of the file
        file_size = file.seek(0, 2)
        file.seek(0)

        # Initialize the search range
        left = 0
        right = file_size

        while left < right:
            # Calculate the middle position
            mid = (left + right) // 2

            # Move the file pointer to the middle position
            file.seek(mid)

            # Read the line at the middle position
            try:
                file.readline()
            except ValueError:
                # If the file pointer is at the end of the file, read the last line
                file.seek(-1, 1)
                line = file.readline().strip()
            else:
                # If the file pointer is not at the end of the file, read the line at the middle position
                file.seek(-1, 1)
                line = file.readline().strip()

            # Compare the line with the target
            if line < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid

        # Return the position of the target or the insertion point
        return left
```

This function takes a file path and a target string as input and returns the position of the target in the file or the insertion point if the target is not found. The function reads the file in chunks and compares the middle element of the chunk with the target. It then decides whether to search in the left or right half of the chunk and repeats the process until the target is found or the search range is empty.

The time complexity of this function is O(log(n)), where n is the number of lines in the file. This is because the function performs a binary search on the file, which reduces the search range by half in each iteration. The space complexity is O(1), because the function only uses a constant amount of memory to store the file pointer and the search range. [end of text]
