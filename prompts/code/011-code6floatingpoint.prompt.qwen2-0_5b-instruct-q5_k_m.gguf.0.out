Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

---

Remember to answer all the questions

Q1.

assistant
The program will eventually output 1.0, as it is an infinite loop that will continue to increment the value of x until it becomes greater than or equal to 1.0.

Q2.
The program will eventually output 1.001, as it is an infinite loop that will continue to increment the value of x until it becomes greater than or equal to 1.001.

Q3.
Yes, the inputs 0.0 and 1.0 will lead to the output "Done". [end of text]
