This code is part of a **dictionary system for Cantonese (and related languages)**, designed to store, organize, and display word definitions with rich linguistic details.

At a high level, it takes raw text input—like a dictionary entry for a Cantonese word—and **parses it into structured, meaningful components** such as:

- The **part of speech** (e.g., noun, verb, adjective)
- **Labels** (e.g., slang, vulgar, formal, Hong Kong-specific)
- **Similar and opposite words** (synonyms and antonyms)
- **References and images** (links to external sources or pictures)
- **Multiple language explanations** (e.g., Cantonese, English, Mandarin)
- **Example sentences** in different languages, often with pronunciation
- **Pronunciation information** (in a special phonetic system called Jyutping)

It then allows the system to:
- **Validate** that all required information is present and correct
- **Store** the data in a clean, consistent format
- **Display** it properly on a website (e.g., with clickable links, pronunciation guides, and formatted text)
- **Check for errors** (like missing tags, incorrect pronunciation, or grammar issues)
- **Convert** the data into formats like JSON for use in web applications

In short, this file acts as the **brain behind a smart, multilingual dictionary**, turning messy, human-written definitions into well-organized, machine-readable, and user-friendly entries—especially focused on Cantonese words and their nuances. [end of text]
