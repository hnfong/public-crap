Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Let's analyze each of the questions in the context of IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic.

### Q1.
The program is as follows:

```python
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

In IEEE 754, floating-point numbers have a finite precision. When `x` reaches a value close to `math.inf`, adding `1.0` to it will not change its value because the increment is too small relative to the magnitude of `x`. This is due to the concept of machine epsilon, which is the smallest positive number such that `1.0 + epsilon` is not equal to `1.0`. As `x` grows, the smallest increment that can be added to it without changing its value also grows.

In practice, the loop will eventually terminate when `x` becomes so large that adding `1.0` to it does not change its value, and `x` will be equal to `math.inf`. Therefore, the output of the program will be `inf`.

### Q2.
The program is as follows:

```python
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

In this case, `x` is multiplied by `1.001` in each iteration. Since `1.001` is greater than `1`, `x` will keep increasing. However, due to the finite precision of floating-point numbers, `x` will eventually reach a point where multiplying it by `1.001` does not change its value because the relative change is smaller than the machine epsilon for that magnitude of `x`. At this point, `x` will be equal to `math.inf`, and the loop will terminate. Therefore, the output of the program will also be `inf`.

### Q3.
The program is as follows:

```python
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

For the program to print "Done", the loop must terminate, which means `x` must eventually reach `math.inf`. This will happen if `inc` is a positive number. Here are two examples of inputs that will lead to the output "Done":

1. **Input:** `inc = 1.0`
   - Similar to Q1, `x` will keep increasing by `1.0` in each iteration until it reaches `math.inf`.

2. **Input:** `inc = 0.0001`
   - Even with a smaller increment, `x` will still keep increasing, albeit more slowly, and will eventually reach `math.inf`.

If `inc` is `0.0`, the loop will never terminate because `x` will remain `0.0` indefinitely. If `inc` is negative, `x` will decrease indefinitely and will never reach `math.inf`.

In summary:
- Q1 and Q2 both result in the output `inf`.
- Q3 will print "Done" for any positive `inc`. Examples include `inc = 1.0` and `inc = 0.0001`. [end of text]
