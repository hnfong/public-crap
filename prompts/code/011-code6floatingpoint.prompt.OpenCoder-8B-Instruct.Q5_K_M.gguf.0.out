The output of the first program is infinity (math.inf). This is because the while loop is running indefinitely because the increment is always 1.0 and the variable x is never going to reach math.inf.

Q2.
The output of the second program is also infinity (math.inf). This is because the increment is always 1.001 and the variable x is never going to reach math.inf.

Q3.
There are no inputs that will lead to the output "Done". This is because the increment is controlled by the user input, and if the user enters a value less than 1, the loop will never terminate because x will never reach math.inf. If the user enters a value greater than 1, the loop will eventually terminate because x will reach math.inf. For example, if the user enters 0.5, the loop will run twice before terminating. If the user enters 2.0, the loop will run once before terminating.
