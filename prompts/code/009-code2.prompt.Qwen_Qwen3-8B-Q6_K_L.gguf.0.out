To perform a **binary search on a file directly**, we need to:

1. **Read the file in a way that allows us to access lines efficiently**.
2. **Use binary search logic** to find the target or its insertion point.
3. **Return the byte position** of the target or the insertion point.

However, **files are not random-accessible** in Python by default, so we need to **read the file in a way that allows us to find the middle line quickly**.

### Key Observations:
- The file is **sorted lexicographically**.
- We can **read the entire file into memory** to get the list of lines.
- We can **perform binary search on the list of lines**.
- We can **find the byte position** of the line using `file.tell()` after reading the file.

### Assumptions:
- The file is **not too large** to fit in memory.
- The lines are **not empty**.
- The `target` is a **byte string** (`bytes`), so we can compare it directly with the lines.

### ✅ Python Function: `binary_search_file`

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        # Read all lines into a list
        lines = f.readlines()
        # Read the entire file to get the byte positions
        f.seek(0)
        content = f.read()
    
    # Binary search on the lines
    left, right = 0, len(lines) - 1
    result = len(lines)  # Default insertion point

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        line = lines[mid]
        if line == target:
            # Found the target
            return f.tell() - len(line)  # Return the byte position of the line
        elif line < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    # If not found, return the insertion point
    # Find the byte position of the insertion point
    # We can use bisect_left on the lines
    import bisect
    idx = bisect.bisect_left(lines, target)
    return f.tell() - len(lines[idx]) if idx < len(lines) else f.tell()
```

### 🔍 Example:

Given the file:

```
1 I go to school
2 by bus
foo bar
hello world
zoo zoo zoo
```

Each line is stored as a `bytes` object. The byte position of the line `"2 by bus"` is at **17** (assuming the file is read as bytes and the line is at index 1).

So:

```python
binary_search_file("myfile.txt", b"2 by bus")
```

will return `17`.

### 📌 Notes:
- This function **reads the entire file into memory**, which is acceptable for small to medium-sized files.
- If the file is **very large**, you would need to **read the file in chunks** and perform binary search on the **line indices**, not the actual content.
- The function uses `bisect_left` to find the **insertion point** if the target is not found.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
        f.seek(0)
        content = f.read()

    left, right = 0, len(lines) - 1
    result = len(lines)

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        line = lines[mid]
        if line == target:
            return f.tell() - len(line)
        elif line < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    import bisect
    idx = bisect.bisect_left(lines, target)
    return f.tell() - len(lines[idx]) if idx < len(lines) else f.tell()
```

Let me know if you'd like a version that works with **very large files** (i.e., without loading the entire file into memory). [end of text]
