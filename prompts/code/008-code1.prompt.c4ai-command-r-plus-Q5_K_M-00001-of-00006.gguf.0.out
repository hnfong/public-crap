<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|><|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|START_OF_TURN_TOKEN|><|CHATBOT_TOKEN|>Bubble Sort and Merge Sort are two popular sorting algorithms, each with its own characteristics and performance traits. Here are the Python implementations and a comparison between the two:

Bubble Sort:
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        swapped = False
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
                swapped = True
        if not swapped:
            break

# Example usage:
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
bubble_sort(arr)
print("Bubble Sorted Array:", arr)
```

Merge Sort:
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left_half = arr[:mid]
        right_half = arr[mid:]

        merge_sort(left_half)
        merge_sort(right_half)

        i, j, k = 0, 0, 0
        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
                arr[k] = left_half[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right_half[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        while i < len(left_half):
            arr[k] = left_half[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1

        while j < len(right_half):
            arr[k] = right_half[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1

# Example usage:
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
merge_sort(arr)
print("Merge Sorted Array:", arr)
```

Comparison between Bubble Sort and Merge Sort:
1. Time Complexity:
   - Bubble Sort: Worst and average-case time complexity is O(n^2), making it inefficient for large lists. Best-case time complexity is O(n) when the list is already sorted.
   - Merge Sort: Time complexity is always O(n log n), making it efficient for large lists.

2. Space Complexity:
   - Bubble Sort: Space complexity is O(1), making it an in-place sorting algorithm.
   - Merge Sort: Space complexity is O(n), as it requires additional memory for creating temporary arrays during recursion.

3. Stability:
   - Bubble Sort: Bubble sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning the relative order of equal elements is preserved.
   - Merge Sort: Merge sort is also stable, as it compares elements based on their original order when equal.

4. Adaptivity:
   - Bubble Sort: Bubble sort is not adaptive, meaning it doesn't benefit from partially sorted input.
   - Merge Sort: Merge sort is adaptive, and it can take advantage of partially sorted input, resulting in improved performance.

5. Ease of Implementation:
   - Bubble Sort: Bubble sort is relatively easy to implement and understand due to its simplicity.
   - Merge Sort: Merge sort is a bit more complex to implement compared to bubble sort, especially with the recursive approach.

6. Usage:
   - Bubble Sort: Bubble sort is rarely used in practice due to its poor performance for larger lists.
   - Merge Sort: Merge sort is widely used and is particularly useful when memory usage is not a concern, or stability is required.

In conclusion, Bubble Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm, but it is inefficient for large lists. Merge Sort, on the other hand, is more efficient with a guaranteed time complexity of O(n log n), stable, and adaptive, making it a better choice for sorting larger datasets. However, it requires additional memory for its operations. The choice between the two algorithms depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the data being sorted.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>
