Okay, I need to write a Java program that reads a string from standard input, extracts numbers with optional suffixes, converts them to their base values, sums them up, and then prints the total in bytes and in kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes with one decimal place.

First, I should think about how to process the input. The input can have multiple lines, so I'll read all lines until the end. I'll probably read each line, trim any whitespace, and then process each token.

Next, I need to extract all numbers followed by optional suffixes. The suffixes can be k, K, m, M, g, G. The numbers can have commas as thousand separators, like 500,000K. So I need to parse these correctly.

I'll use regular expressions to find all the tokens that match the pattern. The pattern should capture the number part and the suffix. The number can have digits, commas, and a decimal point. The suffix is optional.

So the regex pattern could be something like (\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*|\d+\.\d+)([kKmMgG]?)?. Wait, maybe a better approach is to split the number into the value and the suffix. So the regex should capture groups for the number and the suffix.

Wait, perhaps the pattern is something like "([0-9,]+)([kKmMgG]?)". But I also need to handle numbers with decimal points, like 1.5G. So the number part can have an optional decimal point and fractional part.

So the regex pattern should be something like "([0-9,]+(?:\.[0-9]+)?)([kKmMgG]?)". But I also need to make sure that the number is correctly parsed, ignoring commas and converting to a double.

Once I extract each number and its suffix, I need to process them. For each token:

1. Remove commas from the number string and parse it as a double.
2. Determine the suffix and convert the number to bytes.
   - If no suffix, it's in bytes.
   - k or K: multiply by 1024.
   - m or M: multiply by 1024^2.
   - g or G: multiply by 1024^3.
3. Sum all these values into a total sum in bytes.

After calculating the total, I need to format the output. The output should show the total in bytes, then in kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes, each to one decimal place.

Wait, the example output shows:

7264621772.8
7094357.2 k
6928.1 M
6.8 G

So the first line is the total in bytes, then each subsequent line is the total divided by 1024, 1024^2, 1024^3, respectively, each with the appropriate suffix.

So the steps are:

- Read all input lines.
- Split into tokens that match the number with optional suffix.
- For each token, extract number and suffix, convert to bytes, add to sum.
- Once sum is calculated, format the output as specified.

Now, how to implement this in Java.

First, read the input. I can read from System.in, using a BufferedReader. I'll read each line, append them into a single string, then process that.

Processing the string: I'll use a regular expression to find all matches. The regex pattern should find all occurrences of numbers with optional suffixes. The pattern could be something like "([0-9,]+\\.[0-9]+|[0-9,]+)([kKmMgG]?)". But I need to make sure it captures correctly.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use a regex that matches the entire token, capturing the number part and the suffix. So the pattern would be "([0-9,]+\\.[0-9]+|[0-9,]+)([kKmMgG]?)". But I also need to make sure that the regex doesn't match other characters. Maybe I should use word boundaries or something, but perhaps it's better to split the input into tokens by splitting on non-digit, non-comma, non-dot, non-suffix characters.

Alternatively, I can use a Matcher to find all occurrences of the pattern in the input string.

So, the plan is:

- Read all input into a single string.
- Use a regex to find all tokens that match the pattern of a number followed by an optional suffix.
- For each token, process it.

Let me think about the regex. The number can be like 1.5, 500,000, etc. The suffix is optional and can be k, K, m, M, g, G.

So the regex pattern could be "([0-9]{1,3}(?:,[0-9]{3})*\.?[0-9]*|[0-9]+\.?[0-9]+)([kKmMgG]?)". Hmm, maybe that's too complicated. Alternatively, I can split the number into two parts: the numeric part (which can have commas and a decimal point) and the suffix.

Wait, perhaps the regex can be "(\d+[\d.,]*\d)([kKmMgG]?)". But I'm not sure. Maybe it's better to use a regex that captures the number part and the suffix separately.

Alternatively, perhaps the regex can be "([0-9,]+(?:\.[0-9]+)?)([kKmMgG]?)". But I need to make sure that it correctly captures numbers like 1.5G, 2K, 3M, etc.

Wait, perhaps the regex can be "([0-9,]+\.?[0-9]*)([kKmMgG]?)". But I'm not sure if that's sufficient.

Alternatively, perhaps the regex can be "([0-9,]+(?:\.[0-9]+)?)([kKmMgG]?)". That way, it captures numbers with commas and optional decimal parts, and the suffix.

Once I have the number string and the suffix, I can process them.

So, for each match group:

- The first group is the number string, which may have commas and a decimal point.
- The second group is the suffix, which can be k, K, m, M, g, G, or empty.

Processing the number string:

- Remove commas: replace all commas with empty string.
- Parse the resulting string as a double.

Then, based on the suffix, multiply by the appropriate factor:

- No suffix: 1 (bytes)
- k or K: 1024
- m or M: 1024^2
- g or G: 1024^3

Sum all these values into a total.

Once the total is calculated, format the output:

- Total in bytes: one decimal place.
- Total in kilobytes: total / 1024, one decimal place, with 'k' suffix.
- Total in megabytes: total / (1024^2), one decimal place, with 'M' suffix.
- Total in gigabytes: total / (1024^3), one decimal place, with 'G' suffix.

Wait, but in the example, the output is:

7264621772.8
7094357.2 k
6928.1 M
6.8 G

So the first line is the total in bytes, then each subsequent line is the total divided by 1024, 1024^2, 1024^3, each with the corresponding suffix.

So, the steps are:

1. Read input, process each token, sum into totalBytes.
2. Calculate:
   - totalBytes
   - totalK = totalBytes / 1024
   - totalM = totalBytes / (1024*1024)
   - totalG = totalBytes / (1024*1024*1024)
3. Format each with one decimal place.

Now, in Java, I'll need to handle the formatting. Using DecimalFormat or String.format.

But since the output requires one decimal place, even if it's zero, I can use String.format with %.1f.

Wait, but in the example, the first line is 7264621772.8, which is one decimal place. So all outputs are to one decimal place.

So, for each value, I'll format it as a string with one decimal.

Now, putting it all together.
