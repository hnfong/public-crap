Okay, I need to write a Java program that reads a string from standard input, extracts numbers with optional suffixes, converts them to their base values, sums them up, and then prints the total in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes. 

First, I should think about how to parse the input. The input can have numbers with commas as thousand separators, so I'll need to handle those. Also, the numbers can have decimal points, like 1.5G. The suffixes can be k, K, m, M, g, G. 

So, the steps I need to take are:

1. Read the input line.
2. Extract all the numbers with their suffixes.
3. For each extracted number, process it:
   a. Remove commas from the number part.
   b. Parse the number as a double.
   c. Determine the suffix and convert the number to bytes.
4. Sum all the converted values.
5. Convert the total bytes into K, M, G for output.

Let me break down each step.

Reading the input is straightforward using System.in, but I'll probably read the entire line at once.

Extracting the numbers with suffixes can be done using a regular expression. The pattern should match numbers (including decimals and commas) followed by an optional suffix. The regex pattern could be something like \d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*\.?\d*|[0-9]+\.?[0-9]+)(K|k|M|m|G|g)?.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to split the string into tokens that match the pattern of a number followed by an optional suffix. So the regex pattern could be something like (\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*\.?\d*)(K|k|M|m|G|g)?, but I need to make sure it captures both the number and the suffix.

Wait, perhaps the regex should be something like "([0-9,]+\.?[0-9]*)([kKmMgG])?". But I need to make sure that it captures all possible numbers, including those with commas and decimals, and then the suffix.

Once I have each token, I'll process it. For each token, I'll separate the number part and the suffix. Then, I'll remove commas from the number and parse it as a double.

Then, based on the suffix, I'll convert the number to bytes. The conversion factors are:
- k/K: 1024
- m/M: 1024^2
- g/G: 1024^3

If there's no suffix, it's just bytes.

Once all numbers are converted to bytes, I sum them all.

Then, I need to format the output. The total sum is printed in bytes, then divided by 1024 for K, 1024^2 for M, and 1024^3 for G, each rounded to one decimal place as per the example.

Wait, looking at the example:

Input: 1.5G is 1.5 * 1024^3 = 1.5 * 1073741824 = 1608612736.0 bytes.

Another example: 500,000K is 500,000 * 1024 = 512000000 bytes.

So, the sum is the total in bytes, then for each unit, we divide by the respective factor.

Now, for the output formatting, each line shows the value rounded to one decimal place. So, I'll need to format each number with one decimal, even if it's a whole number, like 6.0 G.

So, the steps in code:

1. Read the input line.
2. Use a regex to find all matches of the pattern that represent numbers with optional suffixes.
3. For each match:
   a. Split into number part and suffix.
   b. Remove commas from the number.
   c. Parse as double.
   d. Convert to bytes based on suffix.
   e. Add to the total sum.
4. After processing all matches, calculate the total in bytes, K, M, G.
5. Print each with one decimal place.

Now, let's think about the regex. The pattern should capture both the number and the suffix. So, the regex could be something like "([0-9,]+\\.?[0-9]*)([kKmMgG])?".

Wait, but in Java, the backslashes need to be escaped, so the pattern string would be "([0-9,]+\\.?[0-9]*)([kKmMgG])?".

But I also need to make sure that the regex matches correctly. For example, in the input "1.5G", the number is 1.5 and suffix is G. In "500,000K", the number is 500,000 and suffix is K.

So, the regex should capture groups where the first group is the number (with commas and decimal) and the second group is the suffix (if present).

I'll use a Pattern and Matcher to find all occurrences.

Once I have each number and suffix, I process them.

For the number part, I remove commas: replaceAll(",", ""). Then parse to double.

Then, based on the suffix, multiply by the appropriate factor. If no suffix, multiply by 1.

Sum all these values into a totalBytes variable.

Then, for output:

- Total bytes: totalBytes
- K: totalBytes / 1024
- M: totalBytes / (1024^2)
- G: totalBytes / (1024^3)

Each of these is printed with one decimal place.

Now, handling the parsing: what if the number is something like "123,456.78"? After removing commas, it becomes 123456.78, which is correct.

What about numbers without a decimal part, like "500,000"? That's fine, parsed as 500000.

What about numbers like ".5G"? That would be 0.5G, which is 524288 bytes.

Now, code structure:

- Import necessary classes: java.util.regex.*, java.io.*

But wait, the problem says to only import java.* packages, so I can use the standard ones.

So, in the code:

import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        String input = scanner.nextLine();

        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("([0-9,]+\\.?[0-9]*)([kKmMgG])?");
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(input);

        double totalBytes = 0.0;

        while (matcher.find()) {
            String numberStr = matcher.group(1);
            String suffix = matcher.group(2);

            // Remove commas
            numberStr = numberStr.replaceAll(",", "");

            double number = Double.parseDouble(numberStr);

            double factor = 1;
            if (suffix != null) {
                switch (suffix.toUpperCase()) {
                    case "K":
                        factor = 1024;
                        break;
                    case "M":
                        factor = Math.pow(1024, 2);
                        break;
                    case "G":
                        factor = Math.pow(1024, 3);
                        break;
                }
            }

            totalBytes += number * factor;
        }

        // Now calculate the different units
        double kilobytes = totalBytes / 1024;
        double megabytes = totalBytes / (1024 * 1024);
        double gigabytes = totalBytes / (1024 * 1024 * 1024);

        // Print the results with one decimal place
        System.out.printf("%.1f%n", totalBytes);
        System.out.printf("%.1f K%n", kilobytes);
        System.out.printf("%.1f M%n", megabytes);
        System.out.printf("%.1f G%n", gigabytes);
    }
}

Wait, but in the example, the output is:

7264621772.8
7094357.0 K
6928.0 M
6.0 G

Wait, let me check the example input:

Input:
1.5G, 2K, 3M, and 4.2G
500,000K and 600M

So, let's compute:

1.5G = 1.5 * 1024^3 = 1.5 * 1073741824 = 1608612736
2K = 2 * 1024 = 2048
3M = 3 * 1024^2
