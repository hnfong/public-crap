To perform a **binary search on a text file** containing **lexicographically sorted names**, we cannot load the entire file into memory (as that would use O(n) space), but we can **seek directly to positions in the file** and read lines as needed.

The goal is to find the **position (line number)** of a `target` name using **O(log n)** file operations (seeks and reads), mimicking the behavior of `bisect_left` — i.e., return the **leftmost position** where the `target` could be inserted to keep the order.

### 🔍 Key Challenges

1. **Files are not random-access by line** — you can't directly jump to line `mid` without scanning.
2. **We need to estimate line positions** to simulate binary search on line indices.
3. **We assume lines are not extremely long**, and that line lengths are roughly comparable (or at least not adversarially variable).

---

### ✅ Strategy: File-Position Binary Search

We can use **file byte offsets** instead of line numbers:

1. Use `os.stat()` to get the total file size.
2. Perform binary search on **byte ranges**.
3. Seek to a midpoint byte offset, then **scan forward to the next complete line** (to avoid splitting a line).
4. Read the line and compare it lexicographically with the `target`.
5. Adjust the binary search bounds accordingly.
6. Keep track of line numbers using a counter or by estimating.

But since we want the **line number (position)**, not just whether the name exists, we need to **count lines** or **track approximate positions**.

However, counting lines from the beginning every time would be O(n), defeating the purpose.

### 🚀 Efficient Approach: Seek + Sync to Line + Compare

We can do this in **O(log n)** seeks and reads **if** we assume average line length is roughly known or we can navigate safely.

We’ll use:

- `file.seek(byte_offset)` — jump to a position.
- `file.readline()` — read the rest of the line (to sync to next line).
- Then read one full line (the first complete line after the offset).
- Compare it with `target`.

We simulate binary search over **line indices**, but to jump to line `mid`, we need to **estimate** its byte offset.

---

### ⚠️ Assumption

To make this **O(log n)** in file operations, we assume:

> **Average line length is approximately known or can be estimated** (e.g., from file size / line count), or we accept that in the worst case (very variable line lengths), performance may degrade, but **number of seeks/readline calls remains O(log n)**.

Alternatively, we can **precompute line offsets** (but that’s O(n)). We want to avoid that.

So we go with **byte-offset binary search with line synchronization**.

---

### ✅ Final Plan (Without Preprocessing)

We perform binary search on **byte offsets**, but interpret the result in terms of **line positions**.

But we want **line number**, so we must **count lines** from start to found position? That would be O(n).

So instead, we do binary search on **line index**, and **estimate byte position** of a line using:

```python
estimated_byte_offset = line_index * average_line_length
```

We can compute `average_line_length = total_size / total_lines` — but we don’t know `total_lines`.

So we can:

1. Get file size → `total_bytes`
2. Estimate average line length (if not given) by sampling?
3. Or, **do binary search on line index 0 to n_upper_bound**, where `n_upper_bound = total_bytes // min_line_length` (e.g., min_line_length = 1)

But this is messy.

---

### ✅ Practical & Clean Solution (O(log n) seeks, O(L log n) time)

We **don't assume knowledge of line count**, but we can:

- Use **byte-offset binary search** to find a line that matches or bounds the target.
- Then **scan backward/forward** to find the **leftmost line** that matches `bisect_left`.

But again, we want **line number**.

---

### ✅ Best Practical Compromise

We **simulate binary search over line indices** from `0` to `n`, where `n` is estimated.

We **estimate byte offset** for a given line index using average line length.

We can compute average line length by:

- Reading a few lines from start and end to estimate average.

But for simplicity, assume we can **estimate total lines** as `file_size // avg_est` or just **use a while loop to find upper bound**.

Alternatively, here's a **robust method**:

---

### ✅ Final Algorithm: Line-by-Line Binary Search with Byte Offset Estimation

We will:

1. Use `os.stat` to get file size.
2. Estimate average line length (e.g., read first line, assume average).
3. Use binary search on line index from `low=0` to `high=estimated_line_count`.
4. For each `mid_line`, estimate byte offset: `mid_offset = mid_line * avg_len`.
5. Seek to `mid_offset`, then read forward to next full line.
6. Read that line and compare.
7. Adjust `low`/`high` based on comparison.
8. Return the **line number** where `target` should be inserted.

We accept that **due to variable line lengths**, the estimated offset may be off, but we still only do **O(log n)** seeks and line reads.

    - Lines are sorted lexicographically.
    - File is not empty.
    - Lines are not extremely variable in length (for estimation).

        int: The line number (0-indexed) where target should be inserted.
    """
