## Binary Search on a Text File
Performing a binary search on a text file directly is a bit more complex than on an in-memory list, as we need to consider the file's structure and the fact that we can only access the file sequentially. However, we can still achieve a time complexity of O(log n) by using a modified binary search algorithm.

### Algorithm Overview

1. **Get the file size**: Get the total number of lines in the file.
2. **Calculate the mid point**: Calculate the middle line number based on the current search range.
3. **Seek to the mid point**: Move the file pointer to the mid point line.
4. **Read the mid point line**: Read the line at the mid point.
5. **Compare and adjust**: Compare the target with the mid point line and adjust the search range accordingly.
6. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2-5 until the target is found or the search range is empty.

### Python Implementation

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    """
    Perform a binary search on a text file.

    Args:
    - file_path (str): The path to the text file.
    - target (str): The target string to search for.

    Returns:
    - int: The position of the target string, or the insertion point if not found.
    """
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Get the total number of lines in the file
        file.seek(0, 2)  # Move to the end of the file
        total_lines = file.tell()  # Get the current position (i.e., the file size)
        file.seek(0)  # Move back to the beginning of the file

        # Initialize the search range
        low = 0
        high = total_lines // 100  # Assume 100 bytes per line (approximate)

        while low <= high:
            # Calculate the mid point
            mid = (low + high) // 2

            # Seek to the mid point line
            file.seek(mid * 100)  # Assume 100 bytes per line (approximate)
            file.readline()  # Read the previous line to get to the correct position
            mid_line = file.readline().strip()

            # Compare and adjust
            if mid_line == target:
                # If the target is found, return the position
                return mid
            elif mid_line < target:
                # If the target is greater than the mid point, move the low pointer
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                # If the target is less than the mid point, move the high pointer
                high = mid - 1

        # If the target is not found, return the insertion point
        return low

# Example usage
file_path = 'names.txt'
target = 'John'
position = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
print(f'The target "{target}" is at position {position}')
```

Note that this implementation assumes that each line in the file is approximately 100 bytes long. If the lines have varying lengths, you may need to adjust the calculation of the mid point accordingly.

Also, keep in mind that this implementation has a time complexity of O(log n), but it may not be the most efficient way to search a large file, especially if the file is very large and doesn't fit into memory. In such cases, you may want to consider using a more efficient data structure, such as a database or an indexed file. [end of text]
