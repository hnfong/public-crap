What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The given Python program is an infinite loop that multiplies the value of `x` by 1.001 in each iteration. Since `math.inf` is not reachable, the loop will run indefinitely. Therefore, the program will not produce any output and will likely cause your Python interpreter to crash or run out of memory due to the infinite loop.
