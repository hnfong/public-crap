<think>
We are going to read the entire input until EOF.
 Steps:
 1. Read the input line by line until no more lines.
 2. For each line, split by non-digit characters (but note: the number might have a decimal point and commas)
 3. We need to extract tokens that are numbers (with optional commas and decimal point) and then an optional suffix (k, K, m, M, g, G).
 4. Convert the number part (removing commas) to a double.
 5. If there is a suffix, convert it to the appropriate multiplier (kilo=1024, mega=1024*1024, giga=1024*1024*1024).
    Note: The problem says "converts them to their base value", meaning we are converting the given unit to bytes (if base is bytes) or to the base unit (like converting 1.5G to 1.5 * 1024^3 bytes?).
    But note the example: 
        Input: "1.5G, 2K, 3M, and 4.2G"
        Output: total sum is 7264621772.8 (which is 1.5*1024^3 + 2*1024 + 3*1024^2 + 4.2*1024^3)

    However, the example output also breaks down the total sum into K, M, G. So the total sum is in bytes? 
    Let's check: 
        1.5G = 1.5 * 1024^3 bytes
        2K = 2 * 1024 bytes
        3M = 3 * 1024^2 bytes
        4.2G = 4.2 * 1024^3 bytes

    Then the total is (1.5 + 4.2) * 1024^3 + 3 * 1024^2 + 2 * 1024 = 5.7 * 1024^3 + 3 * 1024^2 + 2 * 1024.

    But note: the example input also has "500,000K and 600M", which is 500000K and 600M.

    So the plan:
    - We are going to convert every number to bytes (base unit) by multiplying by the appropriate power of 1024 based on the suffix.
    - Then we sum all the bytes.

    However, the example output also prints the total in K, M, G. So we need to convert the total bytes to these units.

    Steps for conversion:
    - Let base = 1024
    - K: 1 byte = 1/1024 KB, so totalKB = totalBytes / 1024
    - M: totalMB = totalBytes / (1024 * 1024)
    - G: totalGB = totalBytes / (1024 * 1024 * 1024)

    But note: the example output for the breakdown is in the same unit as the input? Actually, the example output is:

        7264621772.8
        7094357.2 k
        6928.1 M
        6.8 G

    Wait, let me recalc:

    Total bytes = 1.5G + 2K + 3M + 4.2G + 500000K + 600M

    Convert each to bytes:
        1.5G = 1.5 * 1024^3 = 1.5 * 1073741824 = 1610612736
        2K = 2 * 1024 = 2048
        3M = 3 * 1024^2 = 3 * 1048576 = 3145728
        4.2G = 4.2 * 1073741824 = 4510115460.8
        500000K = 500000 * 1024 = 524200000
        600M = 600 * 1048576 = 629145600

    Sum = 1610612736 + 2048 + 3145728 + 4510115460.8 + 524200000 + 629145600
        = 1610612736 + 2048 + 3145728 + 4510115460.8 + 524200000 + 629145600
        = 6928.1 M? Let's break down the breakdown:

    The example output says:
        7094357.2 k
        6928.1 M
        6.8 G

    But note: the total bytes is 7264621772.8 (as per example). Let's check:

        1610612736 (1.5G) + 4510115460.8 (4.2G) = 6120728196.8
        3145728 (3M) + 629145600 (600M) = 632291328
        2048 (2K) + 524200000 (500000K) = 524202048

        Total = 6120728196.8 + 632291328 + 524202048 = 6120728196.8 + 1156503376 = 7277231572.8

    Wait, that doesn't match the example total of 7264621772.8. Let me recalc the example total:

    Example input: 
        "1.5G, 2K, 3M, and 4.2G"
        "500,000K and 600M"

    The example output total is 7264621772.8.

    Let me break the example input again:

        First line: "1.5G, 2K, 3M, and 4.2G"
            1.5G -> 1.5 * 1024^3 = 1610612736
            2K -> 2 * 1024 = 2048
            3M -> 3 * 1024^2 = 3145728
            4.2G -> 4.2 * 1024^3 = 4510115460.8

        Second line: "500,000K and 600M"
            500,000K -> 500000 * 1024 = 524200000
            600M -> 600 * 1024^2 = 629145600

        Now, let's add them:

            1610612736 + 2048 = 1610614784
            1610614784 + 3145728 = 1613760512
            1613760512 + 4510115460.8 = 6123875972.8
            6123875972.8 + 524200000 = 6648075972.8
            6648075972.8 + 629145600 = 7277221572.8

        But the example output total is 7264621772.8.

    There seems to be a discrepancy. Let me check the example again:

        Example input:
            "1.5G, 2K, 3M, and 4.2G"
            "500,000K and 600M"

        Example output:
            "7264621772.8"

    Wait, maybe the example input is meant to be:

        First line: "1.5G, 2K, 3M, and 4.2G"
        Second line: "500,000K and 600M"

    But note: the example output breakdown:

        7094357.2 k   -> 7094357.2 * 1024 = 7264621772.8 (exactly the total bytes)

        So, 7094357.2 k is the total in kilobytes? But wait, the example output says:

            7264621772.8   (total in bytes)
            7094357.2 k    (total in kilobytes, but note: 1k is 1024 bytes, so 7094357.2 k is 7094357.2 * 1024 bytes)

        And indeed: 7094357.2 * 1024 = 7264621772.8

    So the example output is:

        Total bytes: 7264621772.8
        Then, the same total in kilobytes (with the unit k) is 7094357.2 k
        Then, in megabytes (unit M): 6928.1 M
        Then, in gigabytes (unit G): 6.8 G

    How did they get 6928.1 M and 6.8 G?

        M: 7264621772.8 / (1024*1024) = 7264621772.8 / 1048576 ≈ 6928.1
        G: 7264621772.8 / (1024*1024*1024) = 7264621772.8 / 1073741824 ≈ 6.8

    So the program should:

        - Convert every number (with optional commas and decimal point) and suffix (k, K, m, M, g, G) to bytes.
        - Sum all the bytes to get a total.
        - Then, output the total in bytes (with one decimal place).
        - Then, output the total in kilobytes (K) with one decimal place and the unit 'k' (lowercase).
        - Then, output the total in megabytes (M) with one decimal place and the unit 'M'.
        - Then, output the total in gigabytes (G) with one decimal place and the unit 'G'.

    But note: the example input has commas as thousand separators. We must remove commas from the number string.

    Steps:

    We'll read the input until EOF.

    We can use a Scanner to read the entire input as a string and then split by non-digit characters? But note: the number might have a decimal point and the suffix is a letter.

    Alternatively, we can split the input by spaces and then by commas? But the input can have multiple lines and arbitrary text.

    Better: use regular expressions to find all occurrences of numbers (with optional commas and decimal point) followed by an optional suffix.

    Pattern: We want to match:
        - Optional: a minus sign? (the problem doesn't say negative numbers, but let's assume positive only for now)
        - Digits, with commas allowed (but note: commas are only between digits, not at the beginning or end, and not in the decimal part)
        - Optional decimal point and more digits
        - Optional suffix: one of [kKmMgG]

    We can split the string by non-digit characters, but then we have to reassemble the numbers.

    Alternatively, we can use a Pattern that matches:

        Pattern: ([-]?\d{1,3}(,\d{3})*(\.\d+)?[kKmMgG]?)|([-]?\d+\.?\d*[kKmMgG]?)|([-]?\d+)

    But note: the example input has commas and decimal points. We can break the input into tokens that are numbers and then the rest.

    Let me try a simpler approach:

        We can split the string by non-digit characters, but then we have to be careful because the number might have a decimal point and commas.

    Alternatively, we can use:

        String[] tokens = input.split("[^0-9.]+");

    But this will split by any non-digit and non-dot, so it will capture numbers and the rest. However, the suffix is a letter, so we might lose the suffix if we split by non-digit.

    Another idea: use a Matcher for a pattern that matches numbers (with commas and decimal) and then an optional suffix.

    Pattern: "\\d{1,3}(?:,\\d{3})*(?:\\.\\d+)?[kKmMgG]?"

    But note: the number might be without commas and without a decimal part, and the suffix might be absent.

    Let me define:

        Pattern: "([-]?)\\d{1,3}(?:,\\d{3})*(?:\\.\\d+)?[kKmMgG]?(?=[^\\d]|$)"

    However, we are reading the entire input and we want to capture the numbers and their suffixes.

    We can do:

        Pattern: "([-]?)\\d{1,3}(?:,\\d{3})*(?:\\.\\d+)?[kKmMgG]?"

    But note: the example input has "500,000K", so we must capture the entire number including the commas and the suffix.

    Steps:

        We'll use a Pattern and Matcher to find all matches in the input string.

        For each match:
            - Remove commas (if any) from the numeric part.
            - Convert the numeric part to double.
            - If there is a suffix, map it to a multiplier (kilo, mega, giga). Note: the problem says base value, so we are converting to bytes.

        The suffixes:
            k, K -> 1024
            m, M -> 1024*1024
            g, G -> 1024*1024*1024

        But note: the example input uses the same base for all? Actually, the example input has numbers in different units and we are converting them all to bytes.

        So, if we find a number with a suffix, we multiply the numeric part by the appropriate power of 1024.

        If we find a number without a suffix, we assume it's in bytes? But wait, the example input doesn't have any without a suffix. The problem says "numbers followed by optional suffixes", so we must handle numbers without suffixes.

        However, the example output breakdown is in k, M, G. So the total is in bytes, and then we convert to these units.

        But note: the example input does not have any number without a suffix. The problem says "optional suffixes", meaning the suffix might be absent.

        Let me re-read: "extracts all numbers followed by optional suffixes". So the numbers are always followed by a suffix? Or the suffix is optional? The example input has numbers with suffixes.

        The problem says: "converts them to their base value", meaning the base value is the value in bytes. So if the suffix is absent, we assume it's in bytes? But then the example input doesn't have any without suffix, so we must handle both.

        However, the example output breakdown is in k, M, G. So the breakdown is not in bytes but in the respective units.

        So, the breakdown is:

            k: totalBytes / 1024
            M: totalBytes / (1024*1024)
            G: totalBytes / (1024*1024*1024)

        But note: the example output for the breakdown is:

            7094357.2 k
            6928.1 M
            6.8 G

        And the total is 7264621772.8 bytes.

        So, the breakdown is in the unit of the suffix, but note: the breakdown is for the total in bytes, converted to the respective unit.

        However, the example input has numbers in different units. We are converting each to bytes and then summing.

        Now, what if a number doesn't have a suffix? We assume it's in bytes.

        So, the plan:

            totalBytes = 0

            For each token (number with optional suffix) in the input:
                - Remove commas from the numeric part.
                - Convert the numeric part to double.
                - If there is a suffix, multiply by the appropriate power of 1024 (so that we get bytes).
                - If there is no suffix, then the number is already in bytes.

            Then, we have the total in bytes.

            Then, we convert the totalBytes to:
                - Kilobytes: totalBytes / 1024.0
                - Megabytes: totalBytes / (1024.0 * 1024.0)
                - Gigabytes: totalBytes / (1024.0 * 1024.0 * 1024.0)

            And format each to one decimal place.

        But note: the example input has "2K", so we convert 2 to 2 * 1024 = 2048 bytes.

        Example: "500,000K" -> remove commas: "500000", then 500000 * 1024 = 512000000000 bytes.

        However, the example input also has "500,000K and 600M", so we must be able to parse the commas.

        Steps for parsing:

            We can use a regular expression to match the entire token.

            Pattern: "([-]?)\\d{1,3}(?:,\\d{3})*(?:\\.\\d+)?[kKmMgG]?"

            But note: the number might be negative? The problem doesn't specify, but let's assume positive only.

            We'll split the input string by any non-digit, non-dot, non-comma, non-letter? Actually, we want to capture the entire number and suffix.

            Alternatively, we can split the string by spaces and then by commas, but that might be error prone.

            Let me use a Pattern that matches:

                ([-]?\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*(?:\.\d+)?[kKmMgG]?)|([-]?\d+(?:\.\d+)?[kKmMgG]?)|([-]?\d+(?:\.\d+)?)

            But note: the suffix is only one of k, K, m, M, g, G, and the number part can have commas and decimal.

            We can break the input string and then try to parse each token.

        However, a simpler way is to use:

            Pattern: "\\d{1,3}(?:,\\d{3})*(?:\\.\\d+)?[kKmMgG]?"

        But this doesn't capture the sign. Let's assume no negative numbers.

        We'll use:

            Pattern: "\\d{1,3}(?:,\\d{3})*(?:\\.\\d+)?[kKmMgG]?"

        Then, for each match:

            - Remove commas (if any) from the numeric part.
            - Convert to double.
            - If the suffix is present, then multiply by the corresponding power of 1024.

        But note: the same token might have a suffix and we are converting to bytes.

        Example: "1.5G" -> numeric part "1.5", suffix "G", so value = 1.5 * 1024^3.

        Now, what if the token is just a number without a suffix? Then we assume it's in bytes.

        However, the example input does not have such tokens, but the problem says "optional suffixes", so we must handle.

        But note: the example output breakdown is in k, M, G. So the breakdown is for the total in bytes, and we are converting to these units.

        We'll do:

            totalBytes = 0

            For each match:
                String numStr = the numeric part (without commas and without suffix)
                String suffix = the suffix part (if present)

                double num = Double.parseDouble(numStr.replace(",", ""));

                if (suffix != null && !suffix.isEmpty()) {
                    switch (suffix.toUpperCase()) {
                        case "K": case "k":
                            num *= 1024;
                            break;
                        case "M": case "m":
                            num *= 1024 * 1024;
                            break;
                        case "G": case "g":
                            num *= 1024 * 1024 * 1024;
                            break;
                    }
                }

                totalBytes += num;

        Then, we output:

            System.out.println(totalBytes); // with one decimal place

            Then, we convert totalBytes to kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes and format to one decimal place.

        But note: the breakdown is in the unit of the suffix, but the example output uses lowercase for k and uppercase for K? Actually, the example output uses:

            "7094357.2 k"
            "6928.1 M"
            "6.8 G"

        So, the breakdown for kilobytes uses 'k' (lowercase) and for megabytes uses 'M' (uppercase) and gigabytes uses 'G' (uppercase).

        However, the problem says: "prints the total sum as well as the sum in kilobytes (K), megabytes (M), and gigabytes (G)".

        But note: the example output uses lowercase for k and uppercase for M and G. The problem says "K", "M", "G", but the example output uses lowercase for k and uppercase for M and G.

        Let me check the example output again:

            "7264621772.8"
            "7094357.2 k"
            "6928.1 M"
            "6.8 G"

        The problem says: "the sum in kilobytes (K)", meaning the unit is K (uppercase) but the example output uses k (lowercase). 

        However, the example input uses both. The problem says: "supports both lowercase and uppercase suffixes".

        So, for the breakdown, we are to use the same representation? The example output uses lowercase for k and uppercase for M and G.

        But note: the breakdown is just the total in bytes converted to the respective unit, and we are to print the unit as given in the problem: K, M, G.

        Wait, the problem says: "prints the total sum as well as the sum in kilobytes (K), megabytes (M), and gigabytes (G)".

        So, we should use:

            Kilobytes: unit 'K'
            Megabytes: unit 'M'
            Gigabytes: unit 'G'

        But the example output uses lowercase for k. This is a discrepancy.

        Let me read the example output again:

            Example output:

                7264621772.8
                7094357.2 k
                6928.1 M
                6.8 G

        The problem says: "the sum in kilobytes (K)" but the example output uses 'k'. 

        However, note that the example input uses both, and the example output uses the same case as the input for the breakdown? 

        But wait, the breakdown is for the total, so it doesn't have the same case as the input. The input had "K" and "M", but the breakdown for kilobytes is printed as 'k'. 

        The problem says: "the sum in kilobytes (K)" meaning the unit is K (uppercase) but the example output uses lowercase. 

        Let me check the example input: it has "2K" and "500,000K", so the input uses uppercase. But the breakdown for kilobytes is printed as lowercase.

        This is confusing. The problem says: "prints the total sum as well as the sum in kilobytes (K), megabytes (M), and gigabytes (G)".

        So, we must print the breakdown in the units as specified: K, M, G (uppercase). But the example output uses lowercase for k and uppercase for M and G.

        Wait, the example output for the breakdown:

            "7094357.2 k"   -> This is the breakdown for kilobytes, but the problem says (K) so we should use 'K'
            "6928.1 M"      -> This is megabytes, and the problem says (M) so we use 'M'
            "6.8 G"         -> This is gigabytes, and the problem says (G) so we use 'G'

        But note: the example input uses both cases, and the example output uses the same case as the input for the breakdown? 

        Actually, the example output breakdown uses:

            k for kilobytes (from the input which used K, but note: the input had two K's and one M and one G, but the breakdown for kilobytes is printed as k, which is the same as the input's K? No, the input used K and the breakdown uses k.

        Let me re-read the problem: it says "the sum in kilobytes (K)", meaning the unit is K (uppercase) but the example output uses lowercase.

        There seems to be a mistake in the example output. However, the example input and output are provided and we must match the example.

        But wait, the example output says:

            "7264621772.8"
            "7094357.2 k"
            "6928.1 M"
            "6.8 G"

        And the example input has:

            "1.5G, 2K, 3M, and 4.2G"
            "500,000K and 600M"

        So, the breakdown for kilobytes is printed as 'k' (lowercase) even though the input used uppercase. 

        The problem says: "converts them to their base value", and then the breakdown is in the base value? No, the breakdown is in the respective units.

        But note: the example output breakdown is the total in bytes divided by the unit factor, and then printed with the unit letter in the same case as the input? 

        Actually, the example input has two K's and one M and one G. The breakdown for kilobytes is printed as 'k' (lowercase) and for megabytes as 'M' (uppercase) and for gigabytes as 'G' (uppercase). 

        This is inconsistent.

        Let me look at the example output again: the breakdown for kilobytes is printed as 'k' (lowercase) and for the others as uppercase.

        The problem says: "the sum in kilobytes (K)", so it expects uppercase. But the example output uses lowercase.

        I think there is a mistake in the example output. However, the problem says:

            Example output:

                7264621772.8
                7094357.2 k
                6928.1 M
                6.8 G

        So, we must output exactly as the example.

        Therefore, we are to output:

            - The total in bytes (without any unit, just the number)
            - Then, the breakdown for kilobytes with unit 'k' (lowercase)
            - Then, the breakdown for megabytes with unit 'M' (uppercase)
            - Then, the breakdown for gigabytes with unit 'G' (uppercase)

        But wait, the example output does not specify the breakdown for kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes in the same way. It uses:

            "7094357.2 k"   -> This is the total in kilobytes (i.e., totalBytes / 1024) and then the unit is 'k'
            "6928.1 M"      -> This is the total in megabytes (totalBytes / (1024*1024)) and unit is 'M'
            "6.8 G"         -> This is the total in gigabytes (totalBytes / (1024*1024*1024)) and unit is 'G'

        So, the breakdown is in the respective units, and the unit letter is fixed for each unit (k for kilobytes, M for megabytes, G for gigabytes) regardless of the input.

        Therefore, we don't need to consider the input's case for the breakdown. We always use:

            Kilobytes: divide by 1024 and use unit 'k'
            Megabytes: divide by 1024*1024 and use unit 'M'
            Gigabytes: divide by 1024*1024*1024 and use unit 'G'

        But note: the example input uses both cases for the same unit. The breakdown unit is fixed.

        So, we'll do:

            totalBytes = ... (as above)

            Then, calculate:

                double totalKB = totalBytes / 1024.0;
                double totalMB = totalBytes / (1024.0 * 1024.0);
                double totalGB = totalBytes / (1024.0 * 1024.0 * 1024.0);

            Then, format each to one decimal place and print with the fixed unit.

        Formatting: we can use NumberFormat or DecimalFormat to format to one decimal place.

        However, note: the totalBytes might be very large, so we have to use double and be cautious of precision.

        But the example input numbers are integers or with one decimal, and the total is 7264621772.8, which is a double.

        Steps:

            Read input until EOF.

            Use a Pattern to find all tokens that are numbers (with optional commas and decimal) and then an optional suffix (k, K, m, M, g, G).

            For each token, extract the numeric part and the suffix.

            Convert the numeric part to double by removing commas.

            If there is a suffix, multiply by the corresponding power of 1024.

            Sum to get totalBytes.

            Then, format totalBytes to one decimal place and print.

            Then, format totalKB, totalMB, totalGB to one decimal place and print with the fixed units.

        Implementation:

            We'll use:

                Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("\\d{1,3}(?:,\\d{3})*(?:\\.\\d+)?[kKmMgG]?");

            But note: this pattern might match numbers without a suffix, and that's okay because we assume they are in bytes.

            However, the pattern might also match numbers that are part of a larger word? We are scanning the entire input string.

            We'll use a Matcher to find all matches.

            Example: "1.5G, 2K, 3M, and 4.2G"

            We need to split the input by lines? Or just read the entire input and then split by any non-digit? 

            We can read the entire input and then use the pattern to find all tokens.

            But note: the input can have multiple lines, and the pattern should work across lines.

            We'll read the entire input as a string and then use the pattern to find all matches.

            Steps:

                String input = ... (read from stdin until EOF)

                Matcher m = pattern.matcher(input);

                while (m.find()) {
                    String token = m.group();
                    // Now, we need to split the token into the numeric part and the suffix part.
                    // We can use another pattern to split the token: one that matches the suffix if present.

                    // Alternatively, we can use the same pattern but with a lookbehind? Or we can check the last character.

                    // Since the pattern already matches the entire token, we can check if the token ends with one of the suffixes.

                    // Let me try: if the token ends with 'k' or 'K', then the suffix is the last one or two characters? Actually, the suffix is one character.

                    // But note: the pattern matches the entire token, so we can check the last character.

                    // We'll remove the suffix if present and then parse the rest.

                    // However, the pattern might have matched a token that has a suffix, but the numeric part might have a decimal point and then the suffix.

                    // We can use:

                    //   if (token.endsWith("k") || token.endsWith("K") || token.endsWith("m") || token.endsWith("M") || token.endsWith("g") || token.endsWith("G")) {
                    //       String numStr = token.substring(0, token.length()-1);
                    //       double num = Double.parseDouble(numStr.replace(",", ""));
                    //       // then multiply by 1024
                    //   } else {
                    //       double num = Double.parseDouble(token.replace(",", ""));
                    //   }

                    // But wait, what if the token is "1.5"? Then we don't remove anything.

                    // However, note: the pattern matches the entire token, and the token might be just a number without a suffix.

                    // But there's a catch: the pattern matches numbers with optional suffix, so it will match "1.5" and "1.5G".

                    // We can do:

                    //   String numStr = token.replaceAll("[kKmMgG]", "");
                    //   double num = Double.parseDouble(numStr.replace(",", ""));

                    //   Then, check if the token had a suffix and if so, multiply by the appropriate factor.

                    //   How to know if there was a suffix? We can check if the token contains any of the suffix letters.

                    //   Alternatively, we can use the same pattern
