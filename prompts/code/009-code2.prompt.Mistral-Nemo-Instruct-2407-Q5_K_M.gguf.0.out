Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a text file directly, we can use the following approach. Since we can't seek to an arbitrary position in the file, we'll read and compare chunks of lines at a time. Here's a Python function that implements this:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Initialize start and end pointers
        start, end = 0, 1 << 20  # 1MB chunk size

        while start < end:
            # Calculate mid point
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            file.seek(mid)
            lines = file.readlines(1 << 20)  # Read 1MB chunk

            if not lines:
                # End of file reached
                break

            # Find the position of target in the chunk
            pos = bisect_left(lines, target.encode('utf-8'))

            if pos < len(lines):
                # Target found in the chunk
                return mid + pos

            if lines[pos - 1].decode('utf-8') < target:
                # Target is in the upper half
                start = mid + pos
            else:
                # Target is in the lower half
                end = mid

        # Target not found, return insertion point
        file.seek(0, 2)  # Move to end of file
        return file.tell()
```

This function uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point of the target in each chunk of lines. The chunk size is set to 1MB (2^20 bytes) to balance between reading too much data at once and making too many seeks.

The time complexity of this function is O(log(n)) because we're dividing the search space in half with each iteration. The space complexity is O(1) because we're only reading and processing one chunk of lines at a time.
