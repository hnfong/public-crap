Okay, I need to write a Python function called abbrev_num that takes an integer x and returns a string representing it in a compact, human-readable form. The output should be <=4 characters if possible. Let me think about how to approach this.

Looking at the examples given:

- 2 => "2"
- 8180 => "8.2K"
- 9385832 => "9.4M"

So the function needs to represent the number with significant digits and the appropriate scale (like K, M, G, etc.), rounding appropriately.

The output should be <=4 characters. So for numbers where the output would be longer than 4 characters, we need to round it to fit.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Determine the magnitude of x. For example, for x=74581, which is 5 digits, we need to find the appropriate scale.

2. The output format should have significant digits followed by the scale. So for numbers like x=74581, which is about 7.5K (since K is 10^3), so we can represent it as 75K? Wait no, wait:

Wait the sample input 74581 gives output "75K". So let's see:

The sample says output should be <=4 characters. So for 74581, which is 5 digits, output "75K" which is 4 characters (since K is 10^3, so 74581 is approx 75 * 10^3 = 75K. So the length is 3 characters (75K is 4? Wait 75K is 4 characters? Let me count: 75K is 4 characters? 7,5,K? No, "75K" is 3 characters. So perhaps the output needs to be as concise as possible.

So the function needs to find the largest scale where the number can be represented with up to 4 characters.

So the plan is:

- For a given x, find the appropriate scale (like K=10^3, M=10^6, G=10^9, etc.), such that when we divide x by the scale, it's rounded to two significant digits (or something), and then format it.

But let's think about the steps:

First, find the order of magnitude.

We can represent x as x = d * 10^e, where d is a number between 1 and 1000 or something, depending on the scale.

But perhaps better to find the exponent.

For example:

- For x=2: it's less than 1000, so scale is 0 (no exponent), so output is x itself.

- For x=8180: 8180 is between 10^3 and 10^4. So divide by 10^3 to get 8.18, round to two significant digits? So 8.2K.

- For x=9385832: 9,385,832 is about 9.4 million (since 9.4e6). So 9.4M.

So the general approach is:

Find the largest exponent such that x can be expressed as d * 10^e, where d is between 1 and 1000 (or perhaps 100-999.999?), then round d to two significant digits and append the appropriate scale.

But perhaps better to find the order of magnitude in terms of thousands, millions, etc.

So let's think about the scales:

- K = 10^3
- M = 10^6
- G = 10^9
- T = 10^12
- P = 10^15
- Etc.

But since x is an integer, perhaps up to certain scales.

So the function can:

- Determine the highest scale where x can be represented with 4 characters.

So for x:

If x is less than 1000: output as is.

If x is between 1000 and 999,999: output in thousands or similar.

Wait let's think about the output length.

The output should be <=4 characters.

So for x=74581:

It's 5 digits. So we need to represent it with 4 characters.

So 74581 is approximately 75K (since K is 10^3). So 75K is 4 characters.

So the function needs to find the appropriate scale where the number can be represented with 4 characters.

So steps:

1. Find the exponent e such that x is between scale * 10^e and scale * 10^(e+1), but e is chosen to make the total length <=4.

So perhaps:

Compute the number of digits in x. Let's say digits = number of digits.

If digits <=4: output x as is.

Else:

We need to find the appropriate scale.

For example:

x=2: digits=1 <=4 → output "2"

x=8180: digits=4 → output "8180"? But sample output is "8.2K". So perhaps not.

Wait sample input 8180 outputs "8.2K". So perhaps the function rounds to two significant digits.

So perhaps the approach is:

- Find the exponent e such that x is approximated to d * 10^e, where d is between 1 and 1000 (so two significant digits?), but then format it with the appropriate scale.

But let me think about the general approach.

The output should be <=4 characters. So:

- If x is less than 1000: output as is (1-3 digits). So for x=2: "2", x=999: "999" (but wait sample 2 is 2, 8180 is 4 digits but output is "8.2K", which is 4 characters? Let me see:

Wait sample 8180 → output is "8.2K" which is 4 characters (including the dot and K). So 4 characters.

So perhaps the function should format the number into a string with up to 4 characters.

So the plan:

For x:

- Find the appropriate scale (like K, M, G, etc.) such that when x is divided by the scale, it's rounded to two significant digits, and the total length is <=4.

So let's think about the steps:

1. Determine the scale:

   - K = 10^3
   - M = 10^6
   - G = 10^9
   - T = 10^12
   - P = 10^15
   - etc.

   So find the highest scale where x / scale is >= 100 and < 1000.

   Or perhaps find the largest exponent where x can be expressed as d * 10^e, where d is between 1 and 1000, rounded to two significant digits.

So for x=9385832:

It's approximately 9.385832e6 → so rounded to two sig figs is 9.4e6 → 9.4M.

So output is "9.4M".

For x=74581:

It's 7.4581e4 → rounded to two sig figs is 7.5e4 → 75K. So output "75K", which is 4 characters.

So the output length is 4: "75K" is 4 characters? Let's see: '75K' is 3 characters? Wait '75K' is 3 letters? 7,5,K → 3. So perhaps it's 4 characters including the K.

So perhaps the format is:

- For x in [1000, 999999], output as "X.YZK" but limited to 4 characters.

But perhaps better to find the scale such that the number is represented with up to two significant digits followed by the scale.

So the steps:

- Find the order of magnitude.

Compute the exponent e where x is between scale * 10^e and scale * 10^(e+1),
