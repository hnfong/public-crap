Looking at this problem, I need to perform a binary search on a text file without loading it entirely into memory. The key insight is that I can use the file's byte positions to perform binary search operations.

Let me break down the approach:

1. **Find file boundaries**: Get the total file size
2. **Binary search by byte position**: Instead of searching by line, search by byte position
3. **Read and compare**: At each step, read from the current position and compare with target
4. **Handle line boundaries**: Need to be careful about reading complete lines

Here's my approach:
- Use binary search on byte positions
- When checking a position, read from that position to find the start of the next line
- Compare the line content with target
- Adjust search boundaries accordingly

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    """
    Perform binary search on a sorted text file to find target or insertion point.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the text file
        target: Target bytes to search for
    
    Returns:
        Byte position of target or insertion point
    """
    # Open file in binary mode
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        file_size = f.seek(0, 2)  # Get file size
        if file_size == 0:
            return 0
        
        # Binary search on byte positions
        left = 0
        right = file_size
        
        # Find the insertion point
        insertion_point = file_size
        
        while left < right:
            # Calculate middle position (avoid overflow)
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            
            # Find the start of the line containing mid position
            line_start = find_line_start(f, mid)
            
            # Read the line from line_start
            f.seek(line_start)
            line = f.readline()
            
            # Compare with target
            if line >= target:
                insertion_point = line_start
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        
        return insertion_point

def find_line_start(f, pos):
    """
    Find the start of the line that contains or starts at position pos.
    """
    if pos == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Move to the position and find the start of the line
    f.seek(pos)
    
    # If we're at the beginning of a line, return pos
    if pos == 0 or f.read(1) == b'\n':
        return pos
    
    # Go back to find the start of the line
    f.seek(pos)
    while pos > 0:
        pos -= 1
        f.seek(pos)
        if f.read(1) == b'\n':
            return pos + 1
    
    return 0
```

Wait, let me reconsider this approach. The `find_line_start` function is inefficient. Let me think of a better way:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    """
    Perform binary search on a sorted text file to find target or insertion point.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the text file
        target: Target bytes to search for
    
    Returns:
        Byte position of target or insertion point
    """
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        file_size = f.seek(0, 2)  # Get file size
        if file_size == 0:
            return 0
        
        left = 0
        right = file_size
        insertion_point = file_size
        
        while left < right:
            # Calculate middle position
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            
            # Find the start of the line that contains or starts at mid position
            line_start = find_line_start(f, mid)
            
            # Read the line from line_start
            f.seek(line_start)
            line = f.readline()
            
            # Compare with target
            if line >= target:
                insertion_point = line_start
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        
        return insertion_point

def find_line_start(f, pos):
    """
    Find the start of the line that contains or starts at position pos.
    """
    if pos == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Move to position and go backwards to find line start
    f.seek(pos)
    
    # If we're at the beginning of a line, return pos
    if pos == 0 or f.read(1) == b'\n':
        return pos
    
    # Go back to find the start of the line
    f.seek(pos)
    while pos > 0:
        pos -= 1
        f.seek(pos)
        if f.read(1) == b'\n':
            return pos + 1
    
    return 0
```

Actually, let me think more carefully about the example:
- File content: "1 I go to school\n2 by bus\nfoo bar\nhello world\nzoo zoo zoo\n"
- Target: b"2 by"
- Expected result: 17

Let me trace through this:
- Line 1: "1 I go to school\n" (0-16 bytes)
- Line 2: "2 by bus\n" (17-25 bytes) 
- Line 3: "foo bar\n" (26-33 bytes)
- Line 4: "hello world\n" (34-45 bytes)
- Line 5: "zoo zoo zoo\n" (46-57 bytes)

So "2 by bus" starts at byte 17, which is what we want.

Here's my final solution:
