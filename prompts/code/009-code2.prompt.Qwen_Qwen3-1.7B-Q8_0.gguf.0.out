To perform a **binary search** on a file where the lines are **sorted lexicographically**, we can treat the file as a **list of strings** (lines) and use the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module.

Here's how we can implement the `binary_search_file` function:

### Key Points:
- The file is assumed to be sorted lexicographically.
- We treat the file as a list of strings (lines).
- We use `bisect_left` to find the insertion point for the target string.
- The function returns the **insertion point** (as in `bisect_left`), which is the position where the target would be inserted to maintain order.

### Implementation:

```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
    
    # Use bisect_left to find the insertion point
    index = bisect.bisect_left(lines, target)
    
    return index
```

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example file content:
# "1 I go to school"
# "2 by bus"
# "foo bar"
# "hello world"
# "zoo zoo zoo"

print(binary_search_file("myfile.txt", b"2 by"))  # Output: 1
```

### Explanation:
- The `bisect_left` function finds the first position where the target can be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
- The function returns the **insertion point**, which is the position where the target would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

This approach is efficient and works in **O(log n)** time, where `n` is the number of lines in the file. [end of text]
