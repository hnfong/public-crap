Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Remember to answer all the questions

Q1.
### Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following Python program?

```python
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

**Answer:**

The program will run indefinitely because the condition `x < math.inf` is always true. The value of `x` will keep increasing by `1.0` in each iteration, but it will never reach `math.inf` because `math.inf` represents an infinitely large value. Therefore, the program will never print anything and will run indefinitely.

### Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following Python program? Is it different from the results above?

```python
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

**Answer:**

This program will also run indefinitely because the condition `x < math.inf` is always true. The value of `x` will keep increasing by multiplying by `1.001` in each iteration, but it will never reach `math.inf`. Therefore, the program will never print anything and will run indefinitely, just like the first program.

**Comparison:**

Both programs will run indefinitely without printing anything. The difference between the two programs is the way `x` is incremented:

- In the first program, `x` is incremented by `1.0` in each iteration.
- In the second program, `x` is incremented by multiplying by `1.001` in each iteration.

Both programs will run indefinitely because `x` will never reach `math.inf`.

### Q3. Consider the following program:

```python
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

**Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"?**

**Answer:**

Yes, there are inputs that will lead to the output "Done". Specifically, if the input `inc` is a positive number, the program will eventually reach a point where `x` exceeds the largest representable floating-point number (which is slightly less than `math.inf`). At that point, the program will exit the loop and print "Done".

**Examples of such inputs:**

1. **Input:** `inc = 1.0`
   - The program will eventually reach a point where `x` exceeds the largest representable floating-point number, and it will print "Done".

2. **Input:** `inc = 0.1`
   - Similarly, the program will eventually reach a point where `x` exceeds the largest representable floating-point number, and it will print "Done".

In both cases, the program will eventually exit the loop and print "Done" because `x` will eventually exceed the largest representable floating-point number, which is slightly less than `math.inf`. [end of text]
