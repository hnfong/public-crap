Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Remember to answer all the questions

Q1.

assistant
Q1. The eventual output of the given python program is `inf`. This is because the program uses a while loop to increment the variable `x` by 1.0 indefinitely, which leads to `x` becoming arbitrarily large. The program does not terminate because the condition `x < math.inf` is always true, as `x` is incremented indefinitely.

Q2. The eventual output of the second program is `1.001`. This is because the program multiplies the variable `x` by 1.001 in each iteration of the while loop. As a result, `x` will eventually become `inf`, but the loop will terminate after a finite number of iterations, which is determined by the value of `inc`. The program does not terminate because the condition `x < math.inf` is always true, as `x` is incremented by `inc` in each iteration.

Q3. No, there are no inputs that will lead to the output "Done". The program will always terminate because the condition `x < math.inf` is always true, as `x` is incremented by `inc` in each iteration. However, if the input is a very large number, the program may take a very long time to terminate due to the infinite loop. [end of text]
