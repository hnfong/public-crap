Here's a coding task. Please read the requirements carefully as it may contain some nuance.

You are required to write a function that takes in an integer. The output should be a string that roughly represents the number in compact, human readable form. for example, input/output pairs may be:

- 2 => 2
- 800 => 0.8k
- 9385832 => 9.4M

The idea is to represent the number with a couple significant digits and give the order of magnitude. The output string should be less than 4 characters if at all possible.

You may use any popular and reasonable programming language. Make sure to handle all edge cases you can think of.

Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```python
def compact_number(n):
    if n < 1000:
        return str(n)
    elif n < 1000000:
        return f"{n/1000:.1f}k"
    elif n < 1000000000:
        return f"{n/1000000:.1f}M"
    else:
        return f"{n/1000000000:.1f}B"
```

This function works by checking the input number and returning a string representation of it in a compact, human-readable form. If the number is less than 1000, it simply returns the number as a string. If the number is between 1000 and 999,999, it divides the number by 1000 and returns the result rounded to one decimal place followed by "k". If the number is between 1,000,000 and 999,999,999, it divides the number by 1,000,000 and returns the result rounded to one decimal place followed by "M". If the number is greater than 999,999,999, it divides the number by 1,000,000,000 and returns the result rounded to one decimal place followed by "B".

This solution handles all edge cases where the input number is less than 1000, between 1000 and 999,999, between 1,000,000 and 999,999,999, and greater than 999,999,999. [end of text]
