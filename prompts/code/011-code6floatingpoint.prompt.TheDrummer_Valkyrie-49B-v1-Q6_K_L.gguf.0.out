Q1: The program will run indefinitely and never print anything. 

In IEEE 754 floating point, there is no "infinity" value that can be reached by adding 1.0 to a finite number. Instead, once x exceeds the maximum representable finite value (which is approximately 1.8e308), adding 1.0 will result in x becoming "infinity" (inf). However, the loop condition x < math.inf will then become false, and the loop will terminate, printing x.

So the output will be inf. [end of text]
