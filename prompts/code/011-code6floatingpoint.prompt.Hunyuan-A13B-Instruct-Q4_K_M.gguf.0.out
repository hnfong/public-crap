### Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following Python program?

```python
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

**Answer:**
The program will run indefinitely and will never terminate, resulting in an infinite loop. This is because `x` is incremented by `1.0` in each iteration, and in IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic, there is no upper bound on the value of `x`. It will keep growing without bound, and thus `x < math.inf` will always evaluate to `True`.

### Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following Python program? Is it different from the results above?

```python
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

**Answer:**
Similar to Q1, this program will also run indefinitely and will never terminate. In IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic, multiplying `x` by `1.001` in each iteration will cause `x` to grow exponentially without bound. Since there is no upper limit on the value of `x`, the condition `x < math.inf` will always evaluate to `True`, leading to an infinite loop.

### Q3. Consider the following program:

```python
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

**Answer:**
Yes, there are inputs that will lead to the output "Done." The program will terminate if `inc` is a non-positive number (i.e., `inc <= 0`), because adding a non-positive value to `x` will not make it grow without bound. Here are two examples:

1. **Input: `0.0`**
   - If the user enters `0.0`, the value of `inc` will be `0.0`. In each iteration, `x` will remain `0.0` because `x += 0.0` does not change its value. The condition `x < math.inf` will always be `True`, but since no progress is made, the program will appear to hang. However, technically, it will not terminate because the loop condition is always satisfied.

2. **Input: `-1.0`**
   - If the user enters `-1.0`, the value of `inc` will be `-1.0`. In each iteration, `x` will decrease by `1.0`. Since `x` starts at `0.0`, it will eventually become a very large negative number. However, the condition `x < math.inf` will always evaluate to `True` because `math.inf` is positive and unbounded above. Thus, the program will run indefinitely.

**Note:** If `inc` is a positive number, the program will terminate with the output "Done" because `x` will grow without bound, and the condition `x < math.inf` will always evaluate to `True`. However, this behavior is not guaranteed due to floating-point precision limitations, as explained in Q1 and Q2.
