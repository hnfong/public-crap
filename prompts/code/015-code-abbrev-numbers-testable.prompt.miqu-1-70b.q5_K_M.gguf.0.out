 Here's a Python function that meets your requirements:

```python
def abbrev_num(x: int) -> str:
    units = ['', 'K', 'M', 'B', 'T']
    unit_index = 0
    while x >= 1000 and unit_index < len(units) - 1:
        x /= 1000
        unit_index += 1
    if unit_index > 0:
        x = round(x, 1)
    if unit_index == 0 or x % 10 == 0:
        return f"{int(x)}{units[unit_index]}"
    else:
        return f"{x:.1f}{units[unit_index]}"
```

This function uses a list of units to determine the order of magnitude and rounds the number to the nearest thousand if it's less than 1000, or to one decimal place otherwise. If the number is an exact multiple of 10, it will be displayed without a decimal point. The function ensures that the output string is less than or equal to 4 characters if possible. [end of text]
