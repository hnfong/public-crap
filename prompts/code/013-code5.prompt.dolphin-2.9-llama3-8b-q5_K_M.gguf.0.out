What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The program will go into an infinite loop because x is never going to be equal to infinity. As x is multiplied by 1.001, it is always increasing and will never reach infinity. Therefore, the program will not terminate and will continue to execute indefinitely.<|im_end|>
