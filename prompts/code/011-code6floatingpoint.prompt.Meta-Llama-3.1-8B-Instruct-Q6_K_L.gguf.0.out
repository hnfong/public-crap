Q1.

The eventual output of the program will be `inf` (infinity). 

In IEEE 754 floating point representation, `math.inf` is a special value that represents positive infinity. When you add a finite number to infinity, the result is still infinity. Therefore, the loop will continue indefinitely, and the value of `x` will remain `inf`. 

Note that the loop will not terminate because `x` will never become greater than `math.inf`. [end of text]
