Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Q1.

The eventual output of the program will be `inf` (infinity). 

In IEEE 754 floating point representation, `math.inf` is a special value that represents positive infinity. When you add a finite number to infinity, the result is still infinity. Therefore, the loop will continue indefinitely, and the value of `x` will remain `inf`. 

Note that the loop will not terminate because `x` will never become greater than `math.inf`. [end of text]
