Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

Performing a binary search directly on a file can be challenging because files are stored on disk and are not directly accessible like arrays in memory. However, we can still achieve this by using a combination of seeking and reading from the file. Here's an approach:

1.  **Get the file size**: Get the total number of bytes in the file using `os.path.getsize(file_path)`. This will help us calculate the middle position for binary search.
2.  **Seek and read**: Use the `seek` method to move the file pointer to the calculated middle position and then read a line using the `readline` method.
3.  **Compare and adjust**: Compare the read line with the target. If it's a match, return the position. If the target is less than the read line, move the left boundary to the middle position. Otherwise, move the right boundary to the middle position.
4.  **Repeat steps 2-3**: Continue seeking, reading, and comparing until the target is found or the boundaries converge.

Here's the Python function `binary_search_file` that implements this approach:
```python
import os

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        file_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)
        left, right = 0, file_size - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            file.seek(mid)
            # Move to the beginning of the line
            file.readline()
            line_pos = file.tell()
            line = file.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()
            if line == target:
                return line_pos
            elif line < target:
                left = line_pos
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return left
```
Here's an explanation of the code:

*   We open the file in read mode (`'r'`) and get the file size using `os.path.getsize`.
*   We initialize the left and right boundaries to 0 and the file size minus 1, respectively.
*   We loop until the left boundary is less than or equal to the right boundary.
*   In each iteration, we calculate the middle position using the left and right boundaries.
*   We seek to the middle position using `file.seek` and then read a line using `file.readline`. We move to the beginning of the line by calling `file.readline` again.
*   We get the current file position using `file.tell` and store it in `line_pos`.
*   We decode the read line from bytes to a string and strip any trailing newlines.
*   We compare the line with the target. If it's a match, we return the `line_pos`. If the target is less than the line, we move the left boundary to `line_pos`. Otherwise, we move the right boundary to `mid - 1`.
*   If the loop ends without finding the target, we return the left boundary, which represents the insertion point.

This function performs a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations, where n is the number of lines in the file.
