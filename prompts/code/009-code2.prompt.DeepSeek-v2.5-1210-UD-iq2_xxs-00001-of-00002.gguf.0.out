To perform a binary search on a text file where the lines are sorted lexicographically, we can leverage the properties of binary search to minimize the number of operations. Since the file is sorted, we can efficiently narrow down the search space by repeatedly dividing it in half. Here's how you can implement the binary search directly on the file:

### Approach:
1. **File Reading**: Since we cannot load the entire file into memory, we need to read it in chunks. We'll read a portion of the file around the midpoint to determine if the target is before or after this midpoint.
2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - Calculate the midpoint of the current search range.
   - Read the line at the midpoint.
   - Compare the midpoint line with the target.
   - Adjust the search range based on the comparison (move left or right).
3. **Insertion Point**: If the target is not found, return the position where the target would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

### Python Implementation:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Initialize search boundaries
        low, high = 0, sum(1 for _ in file) - 1

        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            # Move the file pointer to the middle position
            file.seek(0)
            for _ in range(mid):
                file.readline()
            mid_line = file.readline().strip()

            if mid_line == target:
                return mid  # Target found
            elif mid_line < target:
                low = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
            else:
                high = mid - 1  # Search in the left half

        # If target is not found, return the insertion point
        return low

# Example usage:
# file_path = 'sorted_names.txt'
# target = 'Alice'
# print(binary_search_file(file_path, target))
```

### Explanation:
1. **File Handling**: The file is opened in read mode, and we calculate the total number of lines (`high`) by iterating through the file once.
2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The midpoint (`mid`) is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`.
   - The file pointer is moved to the midpoint, and the corresponding line is read.
   - The line is compared with the target. If it matches, the position (`mid`) is returned.
   - If the midpoint line is less than the target, the search continues in the right half (`low = mid + 1`).
   - If the midpoint line is greater than the target, the search continues in the left half (`high = mid - 1`).
3. **Insertion Point**: If the loop exits without finding the target, `low` represents the insertion point where the target would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

### Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(log(n)) for the binary search, where `n` is the number of lines in the file.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) additional space is used, as we only store a few variables and read one line at a time.

This approach ensures that we perform the binary search efficiently without loading the entire file into memory. [end of text]
