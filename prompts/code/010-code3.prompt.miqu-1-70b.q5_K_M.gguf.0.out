Consider the following python code:

```
def s(a):
    if len(a) <= 1: return a
    p = a[0]
    l = [x for x in a[1:] if x <= p]
    r = [x for x in a[1:] if x > p]
    return l + [p,] + r
```

What is its intended purpose? Then, please review the code, focusing on mistakes (if any), coding style, efficiency, and any other implementation details that may be of note. Finally, write a new function with all your suggested fixes/improvements, but in the Rust language (not in python).

The given Python code defines a function called `s`, which takes a list `a` as an argument. The intended purpose of this function is to sort the input list using a selection sort algorithm. 

However, there are a few mistakes and issues in the code:

1. The function does not handle edge cases where the input is not a list or is an empty list.
2. The code uses a comma in `[p,]`, which is unnecessary in Python.
3. The code does not return the first element `p` when the length of the input list is 1.
4. The code uses list comprehensions and slicing, which can be less efficient for larger lists.

A possible improved version of the code in Python could be:

```python
def s(a):
    if not isinstance(a, list) or len(a) < 2:
        return a
    p = a[0]
    l = [x for x in a[1:] if x <= p]
    r = [x for x in a[1:] if x > p]
    return l + [p] + r
```

Now, let's write a new function `sort_list` in Rust with the same purpose as the improved Python version, using an efficient and idiomatic approach:

```rust
fn sort_list<T: Ord + Clone>(mut a: Vec<T>) -> Vec<T> {
    if a.is_empty() || a.len() == 1 {
        return a;
    }

    let pivot = a[0].clone();
    let mut low = vec![];
    let mut high = vec![];

    for elem in a.drain(1..).filter(|e| e != &pivot) {
        if elem <= &pivot {
            low.push(elem);
        } else {
            high.push(elem);
        }
    }

    low.extend(vec![pivot]);
    low.extend(high);
    low
}
```

Note that Rust does not have built-in dynamic arrays like Python, so we're using `Vec` instead. This Rust code uses the same selection sort algorithm, but with more idiomatic Rust features such as generics, type annotations, and iterators.
