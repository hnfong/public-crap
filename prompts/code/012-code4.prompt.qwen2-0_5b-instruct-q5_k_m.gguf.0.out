What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)

assistant
The final output of the program is the value of x after it is multiplied by 1.0 until x becomes less than math.inf.

For example, if x is 0.0, the program will start multiplying x by 1.0 until x is less than 1.0. 

After x is multiplied by 1.0, the value of x will be the final output of the program, which is 1.0.
