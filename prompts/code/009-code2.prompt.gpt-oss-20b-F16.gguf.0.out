<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to design a binary search on a file with lines sorted lexicographically. We need to use at most O(log n) operations. The file is sorted by lines. We need to find the position of the target string or insertion point. We need to read the file directly, not load all lines into memory. We can use file.seek and file.tell to navigate. We need to find the number of lines n? We can approximate by file size and average line length? But we can do binary search on file positions: we can treat the file as a sequence of bytes. We can binary search on file positions: we need to find the line that contains the target or the insertion point. We can use file.seek(mid) to find a position, then we need to find the start of the line: we can read backwards until we find a newline or start of file. Then read the line. Compare. Then adjust low/high accordingly. We need to handle the fact that we need to find the insertion point: the position where the target would be inserted to keep sorted order. That is the start of the line where the target would go. So we need to find the first line that is >= target. So we need to find the leftmost position where line >= target. So we can binary search on file positions: low=0, high=file_size. While low<high: mid=(low+high)//2. Seek to mid, then find start of line: if mid>0: file.seek(mid-1) and read one byte; if it's newline, then start=mid; else we need to read backwards until newline or start of file. We can read in chunks backwards. But we can also use file.seek(mid) and then read until next newline to get the line. But we need to find the start of the line. We can do: file.seek(mid); while file.tell()>0 and file.read(1) != b'\n': file.seek(file.tell()-2) ??? That is inefficient. Instead, we can read a chunk of bytes around mid and find newline positions. But we can do simpler: we can use file.seek(mid) and then read until next newline to get the rest of the line. But we need the start of the line to compare. We can read from mid to the next newline to get the rest of the line, but we need the preceding part of the line. So we need to find the start of the line. We can read backwards until newline. We can read a small buffer backwards: e.g., read 1024 bytes from mid-1024 to mid, find last newline. But we can also use file.seek(mid) and then read until newline to get the rest of the line, but we need to read the preceding part. So we need to find the start of the line. We can do: file.seek(mid); while file.tell()>0: file.seek(file.tell()-1); if file.read(1)==b'\n': break; else file.seek(file.tell()-1). But that is O(line length) per iteration. But we can do it in O(log n) operations? We need to use at most O(log n) operations. But reading backwards one byte at a time might be too many operations. But we can read in chunks: e.g., read 4096 bytes from mid-4096 to mid, find last newline. That reduces number of reads. But still we might need to read many times. But we can approximate that each binary search step we read at most a constant number of bytes. But we can also use file.seek(mid) and then read until newline to get the rest of the line. But we need to find the start of the line. We can find the start by reading backwards until newline. But we can also use file.seek(mid) and then read until newline to get the rest of the line. But we can also read from mid to the next newline to get the rest of the line. But we need to compare the entire line. But we can also read from mid to the next newline and then read from the start of the line to the next newline. But we need to find the start of the line. So we need to find the preceding newline. So we need to read backwards. But we can do it in O(1) operations by reading a chunk of bytes. But we can also use file.seek(mid) and then read until newline to get the rest of the line.

But we can do it in O(1) operations by reading a chunk of bytes. But we can also use file.seek(mid) and then read until newline to get the rest of the line. But we can also read from mid to the next newline to get the rest of the line. But we need to find the preceding newline. So we need to read backwards.
