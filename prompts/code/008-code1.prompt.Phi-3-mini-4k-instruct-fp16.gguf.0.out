Below are implementations of Bubble Sort and Merge Sort in Python, along with a discussion comparing both algorithms.


**Bubble Sort Implementation:**


```python

def bubble_sort(arr):

    n = len(arr)

    for i in range(n):

        for j in range(0, n-i-1):

            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:

                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

    return arr


# Example usage

example_array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]

sorted_array = bubble_sort(example_array)

print("Sorted array:", sorted_array)

```


**Merge Sort Implementation:**


```python

def merge_sort(arr):

    if len(arr) > 1:

        mid = len(arr) // 2

        L = arr[:mid]

        R = arr[mid:]


        merge_sort(L)

        merge_sort(R)


        i = j = k = 0


        while i < len(L) and j < len(R):

            if L[i] < R[j]:

                arr[k] = L[i]

                i += 1

            else:

                arr[k] = R[j]

                j += 1

            k += 1


        while i < len(L):

            arr[k] = L[i]

            i += 1

            k += 1


        while j < len(R):

            arr[k] = R[j]

            j += 1

            k += 1

    return arr


# Example usage

example_array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]

sorted_array = merge_sort(example_array)

print("Sorted array:", sorted_array)

```


**Discussion and Comparison:**


Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted. The primary advantage of Bubble Sort is its simplicity; however, it is not suitable for large datasets due to its O(n^2) time complexity in the worst and average cases.


Merge Sort, on the other hand, is a divide-and-conquer algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n) in all cases. It divides the list into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves. Merge Sort is more efficient than Bubble Sort for larger datasets but requires additional space proportional to the size of the array, which can be a downside.


In summary, Merge Sort is generally faster and more suitable for large datasets, while Bubble Sort is easier to understand and implement but not practical for performance-critical applications.<|end|>
