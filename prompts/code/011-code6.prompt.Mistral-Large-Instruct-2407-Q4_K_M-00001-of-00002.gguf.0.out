[INST] Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.
[/INST] 1. **Negative Number**: If the user inputs a negative number, the loop will not run indefinitely because `x` will decrease with each iteration, eventually becoming less than `math.inf`. For example, if the user inputs `-1`, the loop will terminate immediately, and the program will print "Done".

2. **Zero**: If the user inputs `0`, the value of `x` will not change with each iteration (`x += 0`), so the loop will run indefinitely, and the program will never print "Done". However, this is not an example of an input that leads to the output "Done".

So, the only type of input that will lead to the output "Done" is a negative number. Two examples of such inputs are `-1` and `-5`.
