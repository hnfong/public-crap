What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)

model
This program will output **inf** (infinity). Here's why:

* **Infinite Loop:** The `while x < math.inf:` condition will always be true.  Since `x` is initialized to 1.0 and keeps getting multiplied by a value slightly larger than 1, it will continuously grow without ever reaching infinity.

* **Floating-Point Precision:**  Computers have limited precision when representing floating-point numbers. Eventually, `x` will become so large that further multiplications by 1.001 won't result in a noticeably larger value. It will effectively "plateau" at a very large number that Python interprets as infinity.
