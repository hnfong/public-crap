This source code file is part of a system that handles the definition and explanation of words, particularly in the context of Cantonese (Yue) and other languages. It is designed to parse and process structured text that contains linguistic information such as word definitions, tags, examples, and pronunciation.

Here's a high-level explanation of what the file does:

- **Parsing Definitions**: It parses strings that contain structured definitions of words. These strings include tags like part of speech, labels, synonyms, antonyms, references, and images, along with explanations and examples in multiple languages.

- **Handling Tags and Metadata**: It defines and validates various tags used to describe words, such as part of speech (e.g., noun, verb), labels (e.g., slang, vulgar), and other metadata. These tags help categorize and provide context for the word definitions.

- **Multilingual Support**: The code supports multiple languages, allowing explanations and examples to be provided in different languages. It handles the conversion between language codes and ensures that the correct language is displayed based on the user's current language setting.

- **Examples and Pronunciations**: It includes functionality to parse and format examples of how a word is used in sentences, along with pronunciation information (like Cantonese jyutping) and ruby annotations for pronunciation guidance.

- **Validation and Error Handling**: The code includes validation checks to ensure that the input data is correct and handles errors gracefully, such as missing required tags or invalid pronunciations.

- **Formatting and Rendering**: It formats the parsed data into HTML for display, including links to related words and ruby annotations for pronunciation, making the content user-friendly and accessible.

In summary, this file is a core component of a dictionary or linguistic database that manages and presents word definitions, examples, and related linguistic information in a structured and multilingual format. [end of text]
