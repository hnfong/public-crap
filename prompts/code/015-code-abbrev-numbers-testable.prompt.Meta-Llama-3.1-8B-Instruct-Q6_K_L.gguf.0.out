Here is the Python function that meets the requirements:
```python
def abbrev_num(x):
    if x < 1000:
        return str(x)
    elif x < 1e6:
        return f"{x / 1e3:.1f}K"
    elif x < 1e9:
        return f"{x / 1e6:.1f}M"
    else:
        return f"{x / 1e9:.1f}B"
```
This function uses the `f` string notation to format the output string with one decimal place. If the number is less than 1000, it simply returns the number as a string. If the number is between 1000 and 1 million, it returns the number divided by 1000 with one decimal place, followed by the letter "K". If the number is between 1 million and 1 billion, it returns the number divided by 1 million with one decimal place, followed by the letter "M". If the number is greater than 1 billion, it returns the number divided by 1 billion with one decimal place, followed by the letter "B". [end of text]
