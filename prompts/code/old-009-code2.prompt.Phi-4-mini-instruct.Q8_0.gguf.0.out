To perform a binary search on a text file with names sorted in lexicographical order, we can read the file line by line and maintain a list of names. We can then perform a binary search on this list to find the target name or determine the insertion point.

Here's how we can implement this in Python:

1. Read the file and store the names in a list.
2. Sort the list (if not already sorted).
3. Perform a binary search on the sorted list to find the target name or determine the insertion point.

Here is the Python function `binary_search_file` that accomplishes this:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    # Step 1: Read the file and store names in a list
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        names = [line.strip() for line in file.readlines()]
    
    # Step 2: Sort the list (if not already sorted)
    names.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Perform binary search
    left, right = 0, len(names) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        mid_name = names[mid]
        
        if mid_name == target:
            return mid  # Target found, return its index
        elif mid_name < target:
            left = mid + 1  # Search in the right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1  # Search in the left half
    
    # If the target is not found, return the insertion point
    return left  # This is the index where the target should be inserted

# Example usage:
# position = binary_search_file('names.txt', 'Alice')
# print(position)
```

### Explanation:
- We first read the file and store each line (name) in a list called `names`.
- We then sort the list of names to ensure they are in lexicographical order.
- We perform a binary search using a while loop. We calculate the middle index and compare the middle name with the target.
- If the middle name matches the target, we return the index.
- If the middle name is less than the target, we search in the right half; otherwise, we search in the left half.
- If the target is not found, we return the left index, which indicates where the target should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

This approach ensures that we perform the search in O(log(n)) time complexity, where n is the number of names in the file. [end of text]
