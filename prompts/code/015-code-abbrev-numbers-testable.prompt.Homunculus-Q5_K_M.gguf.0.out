Here's the Python function `abbrev_num(x)` that meets the requirements:

```python
def abbrev_num(x):
    if x < 1000:
        return str(x)
    elif x < 1000000:
        return f"{x // 1000}K"
    elif x < 1000000000:
        return f"{x // 1000000}M"
    else:
        return f"{x // 1000000000}B"
```

### Explanation:
- If the number is less than 1000, return it as-is.
- If it's less than 1,000,000, return it in thousands (K), rounded down.
- If it's less than 1,000,000,000, return it in millions (M), rounded down.
- If it's 1,000,000,000 or more, return it in billions (B), rounded down.

This function ensures the output is always **â‰¤ 4 characters** and provides a **human-readable compact representation** of the number. [end of text]
