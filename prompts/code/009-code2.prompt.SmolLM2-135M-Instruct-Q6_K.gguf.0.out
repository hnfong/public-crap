Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

Here's a Python function that performs a binary search on a text file:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    """
    Performs a binary search on a text file.

    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the text file.
        target (int): The target value to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The position of the target, or the insertion point if the target is not found.
    """
    if not file_path:
        return -1

    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    left = 0
    right = 0

    for i, line in enumerate(lines, start=1):
        if line == target:
            return i
        elif line < target:
            right = i
        else:
            left = i

    return -1

# Example usage:
file_path = 'example.txt'
target = 10
print(binary_search_file(file_path, target))  # Output: 10
print(binary_search_file(file_path, -1))  # Output: -1
```

This function opens the text file, reads its lines, and iterates over them. For each line, it checks if the line is equal to the target value. If it is, it returns the position of the target. If the line is not equal to the target, it moves on to the next line. If the line is not found, it returns -1.

The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half. If the target is found, it returns the position of the target. If the target is not found, it returns -1.

Note that this function assumes that the text file is in the same directory as the Python script. If the file is in a different directory, you may need to specify the path to the file as an argument to the function. [end of text]
