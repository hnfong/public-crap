The intended purpose of the given Python code is to implement a sorting algorithm, specifically a version of the quicksort algorithm, but it's not actually sorting the array. It's partitioning the array around a pivot, but only once, not recursively, so it's not a proper quicksort implementation.

Mistakes and Review:
- The function is not recursive, so it doesn't sort the array. It only partitions the array once.
- The function name `s` is not descriptive. It should be named something more meaningful, like `partition` or `quicksort`.
- The use of list comprehensions is fine for Python, but it's not the most efficient way to partition an array because it creates two new lists.
- The `len(a) <= 1` base case is correct for a recursive quicksort implementation, but it's not used here.
- The `p = a[0]` line assumes the first element is always the pivot, which could lead to poor performance on sorted or nearly sorted data in a proper quicksort implementation.
- The `l` and `r` lists are created by filtering `a[1:]`, which means the pivot is not included in either list, which is correct for a partitioning step, but it's not followed by recursive calls to sort `l` and `r`.

In Rust, we can implement a proper quicksort algorithm using a more efficient in-place partitioning method. Here's a Rust function implementing quicksort:

```rust
fn quicksort<T: Ord>(arr: &mut [T]) {
    if arr.len() <= 1 {
        return;
    }
    let pivot = partition(arr);
    quicksort(&mut arr[0..pivot]);
    quicksort(&mut arr[pivot + 1..]);
}

fn partition<T: Ord>(arr: &mut [T]) -> usize {
    let pivot = arr[0];
    let mut left = 1;
    let mut right = arr.len() - 1;

    while left <= right {
        while left <= right && arr[left] <= pivot {
            left += 1;
        }
        while left <= right && arr[right] > pivot {
            right -= 1;
        }
        if left < right {
            arr.swap(left, right);
        }
    }
    arr.swap(0, right);
    right
}

fn main() {
    let mut arr = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1];
    quicksort(&mut arr);
    println!("{:?}", arr);
}
```

In this Rust implementation:
- We have two functions: `quicksort` for the main recursive function and `partition` for the partitioning step.
- The partitioning step is done in-place, which is more efficient than creating new lists.
- The pivot is chosen as the first element, but this could be improved by choosing a random element or using a more sophisticated pivot selection method.
- The `quicksort` function is recursive, sorting the left and right partitions after partitioning.
- The `swap` method is used to swap elements in the partitioning step, which is more efficient than creating new lists.
- The `main` function demonstrates how to use the `quicksort` function.

It's important to note that the partitioning method used here is a simple one and may not be the most efficient for large or specific data distributions. A more sophisticated partitioning method, like the Lomuto or Hoare partition scheme, could be used for better performance. [end of text]
