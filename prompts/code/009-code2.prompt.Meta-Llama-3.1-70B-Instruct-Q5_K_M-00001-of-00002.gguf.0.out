Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

Binary Search on a File
=======================

Performing a binary search on a file requires a different approach than searching an in-memory data structure. Since we cannot directly access the middle element of the file, we'll use a combination of seeking and reading to achieve the desired result.

Algorithm
----------

1.  Open the file in binary mode (`'rb'`) to allow seeking.
2.  Get the total size of the file.
3.  Initialize the low and high pointers to the start and end of the file, respectively.
4.  Loop until the low pointer is less than or equal to the high pointer:
    *   Calculate the mid position.
    *   Seek to the mid position and read a line.
    *   Compare the read line with the target:
        *   If the line is less than the target, move the low pointer to the next line.
        *   If the line is greater than or equal to the target, move the high pointer to the previous line.
5.  Return the low pointer as the insertion point.

Python Implementation
--------------------

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    """
    Perform a binary search on a file with sorted lines.

    Args:
        file_path (str): Path to the file.
        target (str): Target string to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The position of the target, or the insertion point if not found.
    """
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        # Get the total size of the file
        file.seek(0, 2)
        total_size = file.tell()
        file.seek(0)

        low = 0
        high = total_size

        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            file.seek(mid)

            # Read a line from the mid position
            line = b''
            while mid < total_size:
                char = file.read(1)
                if char == b'\n':
                    break
                line += char
                mid += 1

            # Compare the read line with the target
            line = line.decode('utf-8').strip()
            if line < target:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1

        return low
```

Example Use Case
----------------

Suppose we have a file `names.txt` containing the following sorted names:

```
Alice
Bob
Charlie
David
Eve
```

We can use the `binary_search_file` function to find the position of a target name:

```python
file_path = 'names.txt'
target = 'David'
position = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
print(position)  # Output: 3
```

Note that the position is 0-indexed, so the target name "David" is at position 3. [end of text]
