Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").
assistant
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        names = file.readlines()
    return bisect.bisect_left(names, target) [end of text]
