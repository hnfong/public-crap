To perform a binary search on a text file directly, we need to read the file in chunks and perform the binary search operation on those chunks. The key idea is to read the middle part of the file, compare the target with the middle element, and then decide which half to read next. This process continues until we find the target or determine its insertion point.

Here's how we can implement this in Python. Note that this implementation assumes that the file is sorted and that we can efficiently seek to a specific byte position in the file (which is possible in most file systems). We also use the bisect module for the binary search logic, but adapt it to work with file reading.

```python
import bisect
import os

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    # Function to read a chunk of the file
    def read_chunk(file_path, start, end):
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            chunk = file.read(end - start)
        return chunk.strip().split('\n')  # Split into lines

    # Calculate the file size
    file_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)

    # Binary search logic
    low = 0
    high = file_size - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        chunk_start = mid // len(read_chunk(file_path, 0, mid)) * len(read_chunk(file_path, 0, mid)[0])
        chunk_end = (mid + 1) // len(read_chunk(file_path, 0, mid)) * len(read_chunk(file_path, 0, mid)[0])

        # Read the chunk
        chunk = read_chunk(file_path, chunk_start, chunk_end)

        # Find the insertion point in the chunk
        insert_point = bisect.bisect_left(chunk, target)

        # Adjust the search range based on the result
        if insert_point == 0:
            # Target is less than the first element in the chunk
            high = mid - 1
        elif insert_point == len(chunk):
            # Target is greater than the last element in the chunk
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            # Target is within the chunk
            return chunk_start + insert_point

        # Recalculate mid for the next iteration
        mid = (low + high) // 2

    # If the target is not found, return the insertion point
    return low  # This is the insertion point as per "bisect_left" semantics

# Example usage:
# file_path = 'names_sorted.txt'
# target = 'John'
# position = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
# print(f"Target '{target}' found at position {position} or insertion point.")
```

**Explanation:**

1. **File Chunking**: We read the file in chunks based on the current search range. The size of each chunk is determined by the number of lines in the initial chunk read (to avoid reading too much data unnecessarily).

2. **Binary Search Logic**: We use the standard binary search algorithm, adjusting the search range based on whether the target is less than, equal to, or greater than the middle element of the current chunk.

3. **Insertion Point**: If the target is not found, the function returns the position where it would be inserted, as per the "bisect_left" semantics (the insertion point is the first position where the target would fit in a sorted list).

4. **Efficiency**: By reading the file in chunks and performing binary search, we ensure that the operation is performed in O(log n) time, where n is the number of lines in the file.

This approach assumes that seeking to arbitrary positions in the file is efficient, which is typically the case for most file systems. However, for extremely large files or specific file systems, additional optimizations or considerations may be necessary. [end of text]
