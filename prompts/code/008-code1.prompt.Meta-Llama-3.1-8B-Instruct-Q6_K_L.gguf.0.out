Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

**Bubble Sort Implementation**
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """
    Sorts an array using the bubble sort algorithm.

    Args:
        arr (list): The input array to be sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted array.
    """
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n-1):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```
**Merge Sort Implementation**
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    """
    Sorts an array using the merge sort algorithm.

    Args:
        arr (list): The input array to be sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted array.
    """
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
    right = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    while len(left) > 0 and len(right) > 0:
        if left[0] <= right[0]:
            result.append(left.pop(0))
        else:
            result.append(right.pop(0))
    result.extend(left)
    result.extend(right)
    return result
```
**Comparison of Bubble Sort and Merge Sort**

Bubble sort and merge sort are two popular sorting algorithms used to sort arrays of elements. Here's a comparison of their characteristics:

**Time Complexity**

* Bubble sort: O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the number of elements in the array.
* Merge sort: O(n log n) in the worst case, where n is the number of elements in the array.

**Space Complexity**

* Bubble sort: O(1) in the worst case, as it only requires a single pass through the array.
* Merge sort: O(n) in the worst case, as it requires additional space to store the temporary arrays during the merge process.

**Stability**

* Bubble sort: Not stable, as it can swap elements that are equal.
* Merge sort: Stable, as it preserves the order of equal elements.

**Efficiency**

* Bubble sort: Not efficient for large datasets, as its time complexity is quadratic.
* Merge sort: Efficient for large datasets, as its time complexity is logarithmic.

**Real-world Use Cases**

* Bubble sort: Suitable for small datasets or educational purposes, where simplicity and ease of implementation are more important than performance.
* Merge sort: Suitable for large datasets or applications where stability and efficiency are crucial, such as in database sorting or data analysis.

In summary, bubble sort is a simple and easy-to-implement algorithm, but it's not efficient for large datasets. Merge sort, on the other hand, is a more complex algorithm, but it's efficient and stable, making it a better choice for large datasets and applications where performance is critical.
