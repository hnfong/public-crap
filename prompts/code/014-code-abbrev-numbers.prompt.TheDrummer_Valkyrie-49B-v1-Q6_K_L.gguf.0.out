This Python function takes an integer as input and returns a string representing the number in compact form. It handles edge cases such as zero and numbers with decimal points. The function uses a list of suffixes to represent different orders of magnitude (k for thousands, M for millions, etc.). It iteratively divides the number by 1000 until it is less than 1000, appending the corresponding suffix. If the number has a decimal point, it is formatted to one decimal place; otherwise, it is converted to an integer. [end of text]
