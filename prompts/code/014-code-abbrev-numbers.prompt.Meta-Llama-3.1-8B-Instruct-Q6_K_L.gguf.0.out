Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```python
def compact_number(n):
    """
    Convert an integer into a compact, human-readable string.

    Args:
        n (int): The number to be converted.

    Returns:
        str: A string representing the number in compact, human-readable form.
    """
    if n < 1000:
        return str(n)
    elif n < 1e6:
        return "{:.1f}k".format(n / 1e3)
    elif n < 1e9:
        return "{:.1f}M".format(n / 1e6)
    elif n < 1e12:
        return "{:.1f}B".format(n / 1e9)
    else:
        return "{:.1f}T".format(n / 1e12)
```

Here's an explanation of the code:

1. If the number is less than 1000, we simply return the number as a string.
2. If the number is between 1000 and 1,000,000 (1 million), we divide the number by 1,000 and format it to one decimal place. We use the "k" suffix to indicate thousands.
3. If the number is between 1,000,000 and 1,000,000,000 (1 billion), we divide the number by 1,000,000 and format it to one decimal place. We use the "M" suffix to indicate millions.
4. If the number is between 1,000,000,000 and 1,000,000,000,000 (1 trillion), we divide the number by 1,000,000,000 and format it to one decimal place. We use the "B" suffix to indicate billions.
5. If the number is greater than 1,000,000,000,000, we divide the number by 1,000,000,000,000 and format it to one decimal place. We use the "T" suffix to indicate trillions.

Here are some example use cases:

```python
print(compact_number(2))  # Output: 2
print(compact_number(800))  # Output: 0.8k
print(compact_number(9385832))  # Output: 9.4M
print(compact_number(1234567890))  # Output: 1.2B
print(compact_number(1234567890123))  # Output: 1.2T
```

Note that this implementation assumes that the input is a non-negative integer. If you want to handle negative numbers as well, you can modify the function to handle that case. [end of text]
