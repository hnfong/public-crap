Here's a Python function that performs a binary search on a file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. This function uses the `bisect` module, which provides support for maintaining sorted lists and performing binary search.

```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    """
    Perform a binary search on a file directly.

    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the file.
        target (str): The target name to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").
    """
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Read the file into a list of lines
        lines = file.readlines()

    # Remove the newline character from each line
    lines = [line.strip() for line in lines]

    # Perform the binary search
    return bisect.bisect_left(lines, target)

# Example usage:
file_path = 'names.txt'
target = 'John'
position = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
print(f'The target "{target}" is at position {position} in the file.')
```

However, this approach has a problem: it reads the entire file into memory, which may not be feasible for large files. A more efficient approach is to read the file in chunks and perform the binary search on the chunks.

```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    """
    Perform a binary search on a file directly.

    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the file.
        target (str): The target name to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").
    """
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Initialize the low and high pointers
        low = 0
        high = 0

        # Read the file in chunks
        while True:
            chunk = file.read(1024 * 1024)  # Read 1MB chunks
            if not chunk:
                break

            # Split the chunk into lines
            lines = chunk.splitlines()

            # Update the high pointer
            high = low + len(lines)

            # Perform the binary search on the chunk
            low = bisect.bisect_left(lines, target, low, high)

            # If the target is found, return its position
            if low < len(lines) and lines[low] == target:
                return low + high

            # If the target is not found, move the high pointer
            high -= len(lines)

    # If the target is not found, return the insertion point
    return bisect.bisect_left([], target)

# Example usage:
file_path = 'names.txt'
target = 'John'
position = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
print(f'The target "{target}" is at position {position} in the file.')
```

This approach reads the file in chunks, performs the binary search on each chunk, and updates the high pointer accordingly. If the target is found, it returns its position. If the target is not found, it returns the insertion point. This approach has a time complexity of O(log(n)) and a space complexity of O(1), making it efficient for large files. [end of text]
