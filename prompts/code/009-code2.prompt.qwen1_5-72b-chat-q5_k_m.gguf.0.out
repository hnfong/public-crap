Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

Binary search is a searching algorithm that works efficiently on sorted data. In the context of a text file, we can't directly perform a binary search as we would in an array or list because we can't access the middle element of a file in constant time. However, we can read the file line by line and implement a binary search-like algorithm. The main idea is to maintain a lower and upper bound while reading the file.

Here's a Python function to perform binary search on a file:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        lower = 0
        upper = 0

        while True:
            upper += 1
            if upper > file.seek(0, 2):  # seek to the end of the file and get the position
                break

            file.seek(upper)  # seek to the current line
            line = file.readline().strip()

            if line > target:
                return upper  # if the line is greater than the target, return the position
            elif line == target:
                return upper - 1  # if the line is equal to the target, return the position (since it's 0-indexed)
            else:
                lower = upper

    return lower  # if the target is not found, return the insertion point
```

This function works as follows:
1. Open the file in read mode.
2. Initialize lower and upper bounds to 0.
3. Iterate through the file line by line. In each iteration:
   - Increment the upper bound.
   - If the upper bound exceeds the file size, break the loop.
   - Seek to the line corresponding to the upper bound.
   - Read and strip the line.
   - If the line is greater than the target, return the current position as the insertion point.
   - If the line is equal to the target, return the position of the previous line (since lines are already sorted).
   - Otherwise, update the lower bound to the current upper bound to search in the remaining part of the file.
4. If the target is not found, return the lower bound as the insertion point.

Please note that this function assumes the file is large enough to require seeking, and it may not be the most efficient solution for small files. The file is read sequentially, so the time complexity is close to O(log(n)) in practice, but it may not be strictly O(log(n)).
