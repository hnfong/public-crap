To perform a binary search directly on a file, we need to efficiently navigate through the file without loading the entire file into memory. The key challenge is to determine the byte positions of the lines during the binary search process. Here's a step-by-step approach:

### Approach
1. **Initial Setup**: Determine the total size of the file to set the initial search boundaries (low = 0, high = file size).
2. **Binary Search Loop**: While the search space is valid (low <= high):
   - **Midpoint Calculation**: Compute the midpoint of the current search space. Since we're dealing with byte positions, the midpoint is a byte offset.
   - **Read Midpoint Line**: Read the file from the midpoint to find the start of the next line. This involves:
     - Reading a block of bytes around the midpoint to locate the nearest newline character before and after the midpoint.
     - Adjusting the midpoint to the start of the line (the byte position right after the newline or the start of the file).
   - **Compare Line with Target**: Compare the line read from the midpoint with the target:
     - If the line matches the target, return the byte position of the start of the line.
     - If the line is lexicographically greater than the target, adjust the high boundary to the position before the start of this line.
     - If the line is lexicographically smaller, adjust the low boundary to the position after the end of this line.
3. **Insertion Point**: If the target is not found, return the low boundary, which is the insertion point (bisect_left).

### Solution Code
```python
import os

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        file_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)
        low = 0
        high = file_size
        
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            # Find the start of the line containing mid
            # Read backwards from mid to find the previous newline or start of file
            start = mid
            # Read a block backwards to find the newline
            block_size = 1024
            read_start = max(0, mid - block_size)
            file.seek(read_start)
            block = file.read(mid - read_start + 1)
            # Find the last newline in the block
            newline_pos = block.rfind(b'\n')
            if newline_pos == -1:
                # No newline found, line starts at 0
                line_start = 0
            else:
                line_start = read_start + newline_pos + 1
            # Now, read from line_start to the next newline or end of file
            file.seek(line_start)
            line = file.readline()
            line_end = file.tell()
            
            # Compare the line with the target
            if line == target:
                return line_start
            elif line < target:
                low = line_end
            else:
                high = line_start - 1
        
        return low
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Setup**: The file is opened in binary mode, and its size is determined to set the initial search boundaries.
2. **Binary Search Loop**: The loop continues until the search space is exhausted:
   - **Midpoint Calculation**: The midpoint is calculated as the average of the current low and high boundaries.
   - **Reading Midpoint Line**: The code reads a block of bytes around the midpoint to locate the start of the line containing the midpoint. This is done by searching backwards for the nearest newline character.
   - **Line Comparison**: The line starting at the found position is read and compared with the target. Depending on whether the line is lexicographically smaller or larger, the search boundaries are adjusted.
3. **Insertion Point**: If the target is not found, the loop exits, and the low boundary is returned, indicating the position where the target should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

This approach efficiently navigates the file using binary search principles, ensuring O(log n) operations by minimizing the amount of data read during each iteration. The solution handles large files by reading only necessary blocks around the midpoint, making it memory efficient.
