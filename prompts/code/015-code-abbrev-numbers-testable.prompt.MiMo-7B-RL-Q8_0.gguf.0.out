<think>Okay, I need to write a Python function called abbrev_num that takes an integer x and returns a string representing it in a compact form. The examples given are like 2 becomes "2", 8180 becomes "8.2K", and 9385832 becomes "9.4M". The key points are to use a couple of significant digits and the order of magnitude, and the output should be <=4 characters. Also, if rounding makes it longer, we have to adjust. Like 74581 becomes "75K" instead of "74.5K" because 74.5K is 5 characters.

First, I need to figure out how to determine the order of magnitude. The examples use K (thousand) and M (million). So probably, the steps are in orders of 1000. So the approach is to find the highest power of 1000 that the number falls into. Wait, but maybe it's based on the magnitude. For example, numbers between 1000 and 999,999 would be in the thousands (K), and above 1,000,000 would be in millions (M), etc. But how to handle numbers that are exactly on a boundary? Like 1,000,000 would be 1M, right?

So the plan is to represent the number in terms of K (10^3) or M (10^6), etc., but perhaps the steps are K, M, B (billion?), but the examples only show K and M. Wait, the examples given are up to 9 million. So maybe the function only considers K and M. Wait, let's check the examples again. 8180 is 8.2K (which is 8180 / 1000 = 8.18, rounded to 8.2). 9385832 is 9.4M (9385832 / 1e6 = 9.385832, rounded to 9.4). So the steps are K (1e3) and M (1e6). What about larger numbers? Like a billion? But the problem description doesn't mention those. Maybe the function is expected to handle up to M, but perhaps the code should handle higher scales if needed. But the examples only go up to M, so perhaps the code should check for K, M, and maybe B (but the problem says "compact, human readable form" which usually includes K, M, B, T, etc. But the examples don't have B. Hmm. Let's see.

Wait, the problem says "the order of magnitude". So perhaps the code should group the numbers into ranges where they are abbreviated by their highest possible suffix. For example, numbers >=1,000,000,000 (billion) would use B. But the examples given don't have that. However, the problem says "roughly" represents, so perhaps the code should handle K, M, B, etc., but the examples only show K and M. But the problem's examples include up to M, so maybe the code should handle K and M. Let's proceed under that assumption for now.

So the steps are:

1. Determine the appropriate scale (K, M) based on the value of x.

2. Round the number to two significant digits, but also considering the character length limit.

Wait, but the output should be <=4 characters. For example, "8.2K" is 4 characters (digits plus K). "9.4M" is 4. "75K" is 3. So the code needs to find the abbreviation such that when combined with the suffix, the total length is <=4.

So the approach is:

- For a given x, find the largest possible scale (like M, then K) such that when divided by the scale, the number can be represented with up to two significant digits, and the total string length is <=4.

Wait, but how to handle the rounding. For example, 74581 is 74581. Let's see: 74581 divided by 1000 is 74.581. Rounded to two significant digits would be 74.58, but wait, two significant digits would be 75 (since 74.58 rounded to two sig figs is 75). So 75K. Which is 3 characters plus K, total 4 characters. Wait, 75K is 3 characters (7,5,K) no, wait: 75K is three characters? 7,5, K. Yes. So that's 3 characters. Wait, 75K is 3 characters? Let me count: '7', '5', 'K' → 3 characters. So the output is allowed to be up to 4 characters. So the code must find the abbreviation such that the total length is <=4.

So the steps are:

1. Find the appropriate scale (like K, M) such that when the number is divided by the scale, it can be represented with up to two significant digits, and the resulting string (with the suffix) is <=4 characters.

Wait, but how to choose between scales. For example, if a number is in the range of 1e3 but less than 1e6, then K is the scale. If it's >=1e6, then M. But perhaps the code should check for the largest possible scale where the number can be represented with two significant digits and the total length is <=4.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should first check for the largest possible scale (like M), then see if when divided by that scale, the number can be represented in two significant digits such that the total length (digits plus suffix) is <=4. If not, try the next smaller scale (K). If that also doesn't work, then perhaps use the original number.

Wait, but the problem says "the output string should be <=4 characters if at all possible". So the code must find the most compact possible representation that meets the 4-character limit.

So the approach is:

For the given x, determine the possible scales (like K, M, etc.), and for each scale, compute the value divided by the scale, round it to two significant digits (or perhaps one decimal place?), then check if the resulting string (with the suffix) is <=4 characters. Then choose the largest possible scale where this is possible.

Wait, but how to determine the scales. Let's think about possible scales. The standard abbreviations are:

- K (10^3) → thousand

- M (10^6) → million

- B (10^9) → billion

- T (10^12) → trillion, etc.

But the examples given only use K and M. So perhaps the code should handle K and M. But maybe the code should handle higher scales if needed. For example, if x is 2e9, then it would be 2B. But the problem's examples don't cover that. However, the code should handle all possible integers.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, the code needs to find the largest possible scale (like M, then K) such that when the number is divided by the scale, the result can be represented with two significant digits (like 9.4) and the total length (digits plus suffix) is <=4.

Wait, but how to compute the rounded value. For example, 8180 divided by 1000 is 8.18. Rounded to two significant digits would be 8.2 (since 8.18 rounds to 8.2 when keeping two significant digits after the decimal?), but wait, significant digits are counted from the first non-zero digit. So 8.18 has three significant digits. If we want two significant digits, it would be 8.2 (since 8.18 rounded to two sig figs is 8.2). So the code needs to round the number divided by the scale to two significant digits, then format it with the suffix.

But how to round to two significant digits. For example, 9385832 / 1e6 = 9.385832. Rounded to two significant digits is 9.4. So that's correct.

So the steps for each possible scale would be:

1. For each possible scale (like M, K, original), compute the scaled value.

2. Round the scaled value to two significant digits.

3. Format the rounded value with the scale's suffix.

4. Check if the formatted string's length is <=4. If yes, then this is a candidate.

Then, among all possible candidates, choose the one with the largest possible scale (so that the suffix is as big as possible, leading to more compact representation).

Wait, but the code needs to find the largest possible scale such that when the number is divided by that scale, the rounded value (two significant digits) plus the suffix is <=4 characters.

So the code can iterate through possible scales in descending order (like M, K, then nothing) and check for each scale whether the formatted string is <=4 characters. The first such scale (the largest) is chosen.

So the code can start with the largest possible scale (like M, which is 1e6), then K (1e3), then nothing (the original number). For each scale, compute the scaled value, round to two significant digits, format, check the length. If the formatted string is <=4, then return that. Otherwise, proceed to the next smaller scale.

Wait, but how to determine the order of scales. Let's list the possible scales and their corresponding thresholds:

Scale | Threshold (x must be >= scale * 100?) Not sure. For example, M is 1e6. So numbers >=1e3 would be considered for K. But perhaps the code should check for each possible scale in the order of M, K, then nothing. For each scale, compute the scaled value (x / scale), round to two significant digits, then format as a string with the suffix. Then check the length.

Wait, but the code can't just check all possible scales. Let's think about the possible scales. For example, for x=8180, which is 8.18e3. So when divided by 1e3 (K), it's 8.18. Rounded to two significant digits is 8.2 → "8.2K" (4 characters). Which is acceptable. But if the code tried a larger scale, like M (1e6), then 8180 / 1e6 is 0.00818. Rounded to two significant digits would be 0.0082 (but that's three decimal places?), but perhaps the code would format it as 0.0082M, which is longer than 4 characters. So the code would proceed to check K, which works.

So the code can start with the largest possible scale (like M), then K, then nothing. For each scale, compute the scaled value, round to two significant digits, format, check the length. The first scale (largest) that allows the formatted string to be <=4 characters is chosen.

But how to determine the order of scales. Let's list the possible scales in descending order of magnitude. For example, M (1e6), K (1e3), B (1e9?), etc. Wait, but the problem's examples only use K and M. So perhaps the code should handle K and M. But what if x is 2e9? Then the code would use B. But the problem's examples don't cover that. However, the code should handle all possible integers.

But perhaps the code should handle scales in the order of M, K, and then nothing. Let's proceed with that for now.

So the code can have a list of scales, each with their divisor and suffix. For example:

scales = [
    (1e6, 'M'),
    (1e3, 'K'),
]

Wait, but perhaps the code should also consider the original number (no scaling) as a possible option. So the list would be:

scales = [
    (1e6, 'M'),
    (1e3, 'K'),
]

But then, after checking these, if none of them result in a string <=4 characters, then return the original number as a string. But wait, the original number could be very long. For example, x=1234567890 would be 1234567890, which is 10 characters. But the code's goal is to find a way to abbreviate it. So perhaps the code should check all possible scales, including higher ones.

But perhaps the code can handle up to 1e3 (K) and 1e6 (M). Let's proceed with that for now.

So the code can loop through the scales in the order of M, K. For each scale, compute the scaled value (x / scale), round it to two significant digits, then format it with the suffix. Then check the length. If the length is <=4, then return that. Otherwise, proceed to the next scale.

Wait, but how to round to two significant digits. For example, 9385832 / 1e6 = 9.385832. Rounded to two significant digits is 9.4. So how to perform that rounding in Python.

Rounding to two significant digits can be done by first converting the number to a string in scientific notation, then taking the first two significant digits. Alternatively, using the round function with appropriate handling.

But perhaps a better way is to use the 'g' format specifier, which automatically rounds to the specified number of significant digits. For example, using something like "{:.2g}".format(value). Let's test this.

For example:

value = 8.18 → "{:.2g}".format(8.18) → '8.2'

value = 9.385832 → '9.4'

value = 74.581 → '75' (since .2g rounds to two significant digits. 74.581 has two significant digits as 7.5e1? Wait, no. Wait, 74.581 is 7.4581e1. So two significant digits would be 7.5e1 → 75. So yes, the 'g' format with 2 significant digits would give 75.

Wait, let's test in Python:

>>> "{:.2g}".format(74.581)
'75'
>>> "{:.2g}".format(8.18)
'8.2'
>>> "{:.2g}".format(9.385832)
'9.4'

Yes. So using the 'g' format with two significant digits would work.

So the code can format the scaled value with two significant digits, then append the suffix.

But then, the code needs to check the length of the resulting string. For example, if the scaled value is 8.2, then the string is '8.2K' (4 characters). Which is acceptable. But if the scaled value is 74.581, then after rounding to two sig figs, it's 75 → '75K' (3 characters). Which is acceptable.

So the code can proceed as follows:

Loop through the scales in descending order (M, K). For each scale:

1. Compute scaled_value = x / scale.

2. Round scaled_value to two significant digits by formatting as a string with two sig figs.

3. Combine the rounded value with the suffix.

4. Check if the length of the combined string is <=4. If yes, return this string.

If none of the scales produce a string <=4 characters, then return the original number as a string. But wait, the original number could be very long. For example, x=123456789 would be '123456789' which is 9 characters. But according to the problem statement, the output should be the most compact possible. So perhaps the code should check all possible scales, including higher ones (like B, T) if needed.

Wait, but the problem's examples only use K and M. So perhaps the code should handle K and M. But what if x is 1,500,000? Then, using M would be 1.5M (4 characters). Which is acceptable. But if x is 1,500,000,000 (1.5e9), then using B would be 1.5B (3 characters). So perhaps the code should handle higher scales.

But the problem's examples don't include those. So perhaps the code should handle K, M, B, T, etc. But how to determine the list of scales to check.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should check all possible scales in the order of highest to lowest. For example, starting with 1e9 (B), then 1e6 (M), 1e3 (K), and then nothing. But how to generate these scales dynamically.

But perhaps the code can generate the scales based on the magnitude of x. For example, for x >= 1e9, use B. For x >= 1e6, use M. For x >= 1e3, use K. Otherwise, no.

But the code needs to find the largest possible scale such that when the number is divided by that scale, the rounded value (two sig figs) plus the suffix is <=4 characters.

So the code can generate a list of possible scales in descending order of magnitude. For example, scales = [ (1e9, 'B'), (1e6, 'M'), (1e3, 'K') ]

But how to handle numbers that are between scales. For example, x=1,500,000 (1.5e6) would fit into M (1e6). So the code can check each scale in order, starting from the largest possible (like 1e9) down to 1e3. For each scale, if x >= scale, then proceed to check.

Wait, but the code can't know in advance the possible scales. So perhaps the code can generate the possible scales based on the magnitude of x. For example, find the highest scale that is <=x. But perhaps it's easier to loop through all possible scales in descending order and check.

So the code can have a list of scales, each with their divisor and suffix. For example:

scales = [
    (1e9, 'B'),
    (1e6, 'M'),
    (1e3, 'K'),
]

But wait, 1e9 is 10^9 (billion). So numbers >=1e9 would use B. But the problem's examples don't have that. But the code should handle all possible x.

So the code can loop through the scales in the order of B, M, K. For each scale, compute the scaled value (x / scale), round to two sig figs, format with the suffix, check the length. If the length is <=4, return that. Otherwise, proceed to the next scale.

But wait, for example, x=1e9 (1,000,000,000). Divided by 1e9 is 1.0. Rounded to two sig figs is 1.0 → '1.0B' (4 characters). Which is acceptable. So the code would return '1.0B'. But perhaps the code can round to two sig figs, which would be 1.0, but maybe the code can round to two sig figs even if the first digit is 1. So 1.0 would be two sig figs.

But perhaps the code can use the 'g' format with two significant digits, which automatically removes trailing zeros. Wait, let's test:

For example, 1.0 → formatted as .2g would be '1', but wait:

Wait, 1.0 has one significant digit. Wait, no. 1.0 has two significant digits (the 1 and the 0 after the decimal). But in reality, the 'g' format with two significant digits would round 1.0 to 1.0? Or to 1?

Wait, let's test in Python:

>>> "{:.2g}".format(1.0)
'1'
>>> "{:.2g}".format(1.05)
'1'
>>> "{:.2g}".format(1.005)
'1'

Wait, no. Wait, 1.05 has two significant digits. So 1.05 rounded to two sig figs is 1.1? Or 1.0?

Wait, 1.05 has three significant digits. When rounded to two, it would be 1.0 (since the third digit is 5, so round up the second digit). Wait, but 1.05 is 1.05. Rounded to two sig figs would be 1.1? Because the third digit is 5, which is the cutoff. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let's clarify.

Significant figures are counted from the first non-zero digit. So 1.05 has three significant digits. When rounded to two, we look at the third digit (5) and round up the second digit (0) → 1.1. So 1.05 rounded to two sig figs is 1.1.

Wait, but 1.05 is 1.05. The first two sig figs are 1 and 0. The third is 5. So when rounding to two sig figs, the 0 becomes 1 (since 5 rounds up). So 1.1.

But in Python, using the 'g' format with two sig figs:

>>> "{:.2g}".format(1.05)
'1'
Wait, that's not right. Wait, let's check:

Wait, 1.05 is 1.05. The first two significant digits are 1 and 0. The third is 5. So when rounded to two sig figs, it would be 1.1? Or 1.0?

Wait, perhaps the 'g' format rounds to the nearest representable number in the given significant digits. Let's test in Python:

>>> format(1.05, '.2g')
'1'
Wait, that's strange. Wait, perhaps the 'g' format removes insignificant trailing zeros. So 1.05 is rounded to two sig figs as 1.1? Or 1.0?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the 'g' format works. Let's test:

>>> "{:.2g}".format(1.05)
'1'
Wait, that's not correct. Because 1.05 has two significant digits (1 and 0?), but perhaps the 'g' format rounds to the nearest value with two significant digits. Let's see:

Wait, 1.05 is 1.05. The two significant digits would be 1 and 0 (the first two digits). The third digit is 5. So when rounding to two sig figs, the 0 becomes 1 (since 5 rounds up). So 1.1. But the Python code gives '1' as the result. That's confusing.

Wait, perhaps the 'g' format with two significant digits rounds to the nearest value with two significant digits. Let's test:

>>> "{:.2g}".format(1.05)
'1'
>>> "{:.2g}".format(1.005)
'1'
>>> "{:.2g}".format(1.0005)
'1'
>>> "{:.2g}".format(1.00005)
'1'
But wait, 1.00005 is 1.00005. The first two significant digits are 1 and 0. The third is 0, which is less than 5, so rounds down. So 1.0. But the 'g' format would output '1.0'? Or '1'?

Wait, perhaps the 'g' format with two significant digits for 1.05 is '1', which is only one significant digit. That's not correct. So perhaps using the 'g' format with two significant digits is not the right approach here.

Hmm. So perhaps the code needs a different way to round to two significant digits. Let's think of another approach.

Another way to round to two significant digits is to multiply the number by 10^(n-2), round to the nearest integer, then divide by 10^(n-2), where n is the number of significant digits (2 in this case). For example:

For a number x, to round to two significant digits:

n = 2

rounded_value = round(x * 10 ** (n - 1 - int(math.floor(math.log10(abs(x))))) )) / (10 ** (n-1 - int(math.floor(math.log10(abs(x))))))

Wait, perhaps that's complicated. Alternatively, using the decimal module.

Alternatively, perhaps use the following approach:

Find the position of the first significant digit, then round to the nearest hundredths (if two sig figs). But this might be complicated.

Alternatively, use the format string with two significant digits and then process the string to ensure that it has exactly two significant digits. For example, if the formatted string is '1.0', then it's two significant digits. But if it's '1', then it's one. So perhaps the code can use the 'g' format with two significant digits, but then check if the result has two digits. If not, perhaps adjust.

Alternatively, perhaps use the 'g' format with two significant digits and then process the string to ensure that it has two significant digits. For example, if the formatted string is '1', then append a '0' to make it '1.0'? But that's not correct. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps use the 'f' format with one decimal place. But that would give three significant digits for numbers between 1 and 10. For example, 8.18 → 8.2 (one decimal place, two significant digits). But for numbers >=10, like 9385832 → 9385832 / 1e6 =9.385832 → 9.4 (one decimal place). So perhaps using the 'f' format with one decimal place would work. But how to determine the number of decimal places based on the magnitude.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can use the following logic: when the scaled value is between 1 and 9.999..., then one decimal place (e.g., 8.2). When it's >=10, then no decimal place (e.g., 94 → 94M). Wait, but 9.385832 is rounded to 9.4 (one decimal place). 10.385832 would be 10 (two significant digits?), but 10 has two significant digits. So perhaps the code can round to two significant digits, which can be represented as either an integer (if the second digit is zero) or with one decimal place.

But how to format that in Python. For example, 9.385832 rounded to two significant digits is 9.4. 99.99 rounded to two sig figs is 100 (but that's three sig figs). Wait, no. 99.99 rounded to two sig figs would be 100 (but that's three sig figs). Wait, no. 99.99 is 9.999e1. Rounded to two sig figs would be 1.0e2 → 100. But that's three sig figs. Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let's clarify:

Significant figures are counted from the first non-zero digit. So 99.99 has four significant digits. Rounded to two, it would be 100 (but that's three sig figs). Wait, no. 99.99 rounded to two sig figs would be 100 (but the trailing zeros are not significant unless specified). So perhaps this approach is not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can use the 'g' format with two significant digits, which automatically removes trailing zeros. For example:

For 9.385832 → '9.4' (two sig figs).

For 94 → '94' (two sig figs).

For 99.99 → '100' (but that's three sig figs). Wait, but 99.99 is 9.999e1. Rounded to two sig figs would be 1.0e2 → 100. But the 'g' format would output '100', which has three sig figs. So that's a problem.

Hmm. So perhaps the code needs a different way to round to two significant digits. Let's think of a function that rounds a number to two significant digits.

Here's a way to do it:

def round_to_sig(x, sig=2):
    if x == 0:
        return 0.0
    return round(x, sig - 1 - int(math.floor(math.log10(abs(x)))))

Wait, let's test this. For example:

x = 8.18 → log10(8.18) is ~0.91. Floor is 0. So sig-1 - 0 = 1. So round to 8.18 with 1 decimal place → 8.2.

x = 9.385832 → log10(9.385832) is ~0.97. Floor is 0. So round to 1 decimal place → 9.4.

x = 94 → log10(94) is ~1.97, floor is 1. So sig-1 -1 = 2-1-1=0. So round to 0 decimal places → 94.

x = 99.99 → log10(99.99) is ~1.9999, floor is 1. So sig-1 -1 = 2-1-1=0. Round to 0 decimal places → 100. But that's three sig figs. So this approach would round 99.99 to 100, which has three sig figs. But we need two. So this approach is not correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the code needs to use a different method. Let's think again. The correct way to round to two significant digits is to find the first two significant digits and round accordingly.

Another approach is to use the decimal module. For example:

from decimal import Decimal, ROUND_HALF_UP

def round_to_sig(x, sig=2):
    if x == 0:
        return 0.0
    d = Decimal(str(x))
    return d.quantize(Decimal('1e{0}'.format(sig-1 - int(math.floor(math.log10(abs(x)))))), rounding=ROUND_HALF_UP)

But this might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps use the following code:

def round_to_two_sig(x):
    if x == 0:
        return 0.0
    # Find the first two significant digits
    sign = math.copysign(1, x)
    x_abs = abs(x)
    first_digit = int(math.floor(x_abs / 10**int(math.floor(math.log10(x_abs)))))
    second_digit = int((x_abs / 10**int(math.floor(math.log10(x_abs)))) - first_digit)
    # Wait, perhaps this is not the right way. Let's think differently.

Alternatively, multiply x by 10^(n-2), round to the nearest integer, then divide by 10^(n-2), where n is the number of significant digits (2 in this case). For example:

rounded = round(x * 10**(2-1)) / 10**(2-1)

Wait, for x=8.18:

rounded = round(8.18 * 10**1) / 10**1 → round(81.8) → 82 → 82/10 = 8.2 → correct.

x=9.385832 → 9.385832 *10^1 =93.85832 → rounded to 94 → 94/10=9.4 → correct.

x=94 → 94 *10^1=940 → rounded to 940 → 940/10=94 → correct.

x=99.99 → 99.99 *10^1=999.9 → rounded to 1000 → 1000/10=100 → which is three sig figs. But we need two. So this approach rounds to two sig figs for numbers between 1 and 10, but for numbers >=10, it rounds to two sig figs. Wait, 99.99 is 9.999e1. Rounded to two sig figs would be 1.0e2 → 100. But that's three sig figs. So this approach is not correct.

Hmm. So perhaps the code can't use this method. So perhaps the 'g' format with two significant digits is the way to go, even if it sometimes produces three sig figs. But in the problem's examples, it works.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can use the 'g' format and then check if the resulting string has two significant digits. If not, perhaps adjust. But this could get complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can use the 'g' format with two significant digits and then process the string to ensure that it has two significant digits. For example, if the string is '100', then it's three sig figs. So perhaps the code can format it as '1E+2' but that's not desired. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the code can use the 'g' format and then check the length. For example, if the formatted string is longer than 4 characters when combined with the suffix, then proceed to the next scale.

But perhaps the code can proceed with the 'g' format with two significant digits, even if it sometimes produces three sig figs. Because the problem's examples seem to align with that.

So back to the code structure.

The code will loop through the scales in descending order (M, K, B, etc.), compute the scaled value, round to two significant digits using the 'g' format, then check the length of the resulting string. If the length is <=4, return it. Otherwise, proceed to the next scale.

So let's outline the code steps:

1. Check if x is zero. But according to the first example, input 2 is output as '2'. So x can be zero. But the code should handle x=0 as '0'.

But the problem says the input is an integer. So x can be zero. So code should handle that.

But let's proceed.

The code can start by checking if x is zero. If yes, return '0'.

Otherwise, loop through the scales in descending order. For each scale:

a. Compute scaled_value = x / scale.

b. Round scaled_value to two significant digits using the 'g' format.

c. Format the rounded value as a string with the suffix.

d. Check if the length of the formatted string is <=4. If yes, return it.

e. If none of the scales work, return the original number as a string.

Wait, but the original number could be very long. For example, x=123456789 would be '123456789' which is 9 characters. But according to the problem statement, the code should return the most compact possible representation. So perhaps the code should check all possible scales, including higher ones, and if none of them produce a string <=4 characters, then return the original number as a string. But the problem says that the output should be <=4 characters if at all possible. So the code must find a way to abbreviate it.

But perhaps the code can handle up to M and K scales. For example, if x is 1e9 (1,000,000,000), then using B scale (1e9) would give 1.0B (4 characters). Which is acceptable.

So the code can have a list of scales, each with their divisor and suffix. Let's create a list of scales starting from the largest possible. For example:

scales = [
    (1e9, 'B'),
    (1e6, 'M'),
    (1e3, 'K'),
]

But wait, 1e9 is 10^9. So numbers >=1e9 would use B. But perhaps the code should check for all scales up to 1e3. But the problem's examples don't require higher scales. But the code should handle them.

So the code can loop through the scales in the order of B, M, K. For each scale, compute the scaled value, round to two sig figs, format, check the length. If the formatted string is <=4 characters, return it.

So let's code this.

But first, how to handle the scales. For example, for x=8180, which is 8180. The code would check B (1e9) → 8180/1e9 = 0.00818 → rounded to two sig figs → '0.0082B' → length is 7 (0.0082B) → exceeds 4. So proceed to M (1e6) → 8180/1e6 = 0.00818 → same as before. Then K (1e3) → 8180/1e3 = 8.18 → rounded to two sig figs → '8.2K' → length 4 → return.

So the code would return '8.2K'.

Another example: x=74581. Check B: 74581/1e9 = 7.4581e-5 → rounded to two sig figs → '7.5e-5B' → which is longer than 4. Then M: 74581/1e6 = 0.000074581 → rounded to two sig figs → '0.000075M' → longer than 4. Then K: 74581/1e3 =74.581 → rounded to two sig figs → '75K' → length 3 → return.

So code would return '75K'.

Another example: x=9385832. Check B: 9385832/1e9 = 0.009385832 → rounded to two sig figs → '0.0094B' → length 7. M: 9385832/1e6 =9.385832 → rounded to '9.4M' → length 4 → return.

So code works.

Now, the code needs to generate the list of scales. But how to handle numbers that are between scales. For example, x=1500. Check B: 1500/1e9=1.5e-6 → rounded to two sig figs → '1.5e-6B' → length 8. M: 1500/1e6=0.0015 → rounded to '0.0015M' → length 7. K: 1500/1e3=1.5 → rounded to '1.5K' → length 4 → return.

So code would return '1.5K'.

But what about x= 1500000 (1.5e6). Check B: 1.5e6/1e9=1.5e-3 → rounded to '0.0015B' → length 7. M: 1.5e6/1e6=1.5 → rounded to '1.5M' → length 4 → return.

So code returns '1.5M'.

So the code seems to handle these cases.

Now, the code can proceed as follows:

- Create a list of scales in descending order. For example, scales = [ (1e9, 'B'), (1e6, 'M'), (1e3, 'K') ]

But wait, 1e9 is 10^9. So numbers >=1e9 would use B. But perhaps the code should check all scales regardless of x's magnitude. Because even if x is smaller than the scale, the code can proceed.

But in practice, for x= 1e3, the code would check
