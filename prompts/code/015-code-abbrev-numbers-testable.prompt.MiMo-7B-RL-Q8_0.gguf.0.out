<think>Okay, I need to write a Python function called abbrev_num that takes an integer x and returns a string representing it in a compact form. The examples given are like 2 becomes "2", 8180 becomes "8.2K", and 9385832 becomes "9.4M". The key points are to use a couple of significant digits and the order of magnitude, and the output should be <=4 characters. Also, if rounding makes it longer, we have to adjust. Like 74581 becomes "75K" instead of "74.5K" because 74.5K is 5 characters.

First, I need to figure out how to determine the order of magnitude. The examples use K (thousand) and M (million). So probably, the steps are in orders of 1000. So the approach is to find the highest power of 1000 that the number falls into. Wait, but maybe it's based on the magnitude. For example, numbers between 1000 and 999,999 would be in the thousands (K), and above 1,000,000 would be in millions (M), etc. But how to handle numbers that are exactly on a boundary? Like 1,000,000 would be 1M, right?

So the plan is to represent the number in terms of K (10^3) or M (10^6), etc., but perhaps the steps are K, M, B (billion?), but the examples only show K and M. Wait, the examples given are up to 9 million. So maybe the function only considers K and M. Wait, let's check the examples again. 8180 is 8.2K (which is 8180 / 1000 = 8.18, rounded to 8.2). 9385832 is 9.4M (9385832 / 1e6 = 9.385832, rounded to 9.4). So the steps are K (1e3) and M (1e6). What about larger numbers? Like a billion? But the problem description doesn't mention those. Maybe the function is expected to handle up to M, but perhaps the code should handle higher scales if needed. But the examples only go up to M, so perhaps the code should check for K, M, and maybe B (but the problem says "compact, human readable form" which usually includes K, M, B, T, etc. But the examples don't have B. Hmm. Let's see.

Wait, the problem says "the order of magnitude". So perhaps the code should group the numbers into ranges where they are abbreviated by their highest possible suffix. For example, numbers >=1,000,000,000 (billion) would use B. But the examples given don't have that. However, the problem says "roughly" represents, so perhaps the code should handle K, M, B, etc., but the examples only show K and M. But the problem's examples include up to M, so maybe the code should handle K and M. Let's proceed under that assumption for now.

So the steps are:

1. Determine the appropriate scale (K, M) based on the value of x.

2. Round the number to two significant digits, but also considering the character length limit.

Wait, but the output should be <=4 characters. For example, "8.2K" is 4 characters (digits plus K). "9.4M" is 4. "75K" is 3. So the code needs to find the abbreviation such that when combined with the suffix, the total length is <=4.

So the approach is:

- For a given x, find the largest possible scale (like M, then K) such that when divided by the scale, the number can be represented with up to two significant digits, and the total string length is <=4.

Wait, but how to handle the rounding. For example, 74581 is 74581. Let's see: 74581 divided by 1000 is 74.581. Rounded to two significant digits would be 74.58, but wait, two significant digits would be 75 (since 74.58 rounded to two sig figs is 75). So 75K. Which is 3 characters plus K, total 4 characters. Wait, 75K is 3 characters (7,5,K) no, wait: 75K is three characters? 7,5, K. Yes. So that's 3 characters. Wait, 75K is 3 characters? Let me count: '7', '5', 'K' → 3 characters. So the output is allowed to be up to 4 characters. So the code must find the abbreviation such that the total length is <=4.

So the steps are:

1. Find the appropriate scale (like K, M) such that when the number is divided by the scale, it can be represented with up to two significant digits, and the resulting string (with the suffix) is <=4 characters.

Wait, but how to choose between scales. For example, if a number is in the range of 1e3 but less than 1e6, then K is the scale. If it's >=1e6, then M. But perhaps the code should check for the largest possible scale where the number can be represented with two significant digits and the total length is <=4.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should first check for the largest possible scale (like M), then see if when divided by that scale, the number can be represented in two significant digits such that the total length (digits plus suffix) is <=4. If not, try the next smaller scale (K). If that also doesn't work, then perhaps use the original number.

Wait, but the problem says "the output string should be <=4 characters if at all possible". So the code must find the most compact possible representation that meets the 4-character limit.

So the approach is:

For the given x, determine the possible scales (like K, M, etc.), and for each scale, compute the value divided by the scale, round it to two significant digits (or perhaps one decimal place?), then check if the resulting string (with the suffix) is <=4 characters. Then choose the largest possible scale where this is possible.

Wait, but how to determine the scales. Let's think about possible scales. The standard abbreviations are:

- K (10^3) → thousand

- M (10^6) → million

- B (10^9) → billion

- T (10^12) → trillion, etc.

But the examples given only use K and M. So perhaps the code should handle K and M. But maybe the code should handle higher scales if needed. For example, if x is 2e9, then it would be 2B. But the problem's examples don't cover that. However, the code should handle all possible integers.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, the code needs to find the largest possible scale (like M, then K) such that when the number is divided by the scale, the result can be represented with two significant digits (like 9.4) and the total length (digits plus suffix) is <=4.

Wait, but how to compute the rounded value. For example, 8180 divided by 1000 is 8.18. Rounded to two significant digits would be 8.2 (since 8.18 rounds to 8.2 when keeping two significant digits after the decimal?), but wait, significant digits are counted from the first non-zero digit. So 8.18 has three significant digits. If we want two significant digits, it would be 8.2 (since 8.18 rounded to two sig figs is 8.2). So the code needs to round the number divided by the scale to two significant digits, then format it with the suffix.

But how to round to two significant digits. For example, 9385832 / 1e6 = 9.385832. Rounded to two significant digits is 9.4. So that's correct.

So the steps for each possible scale would be:
