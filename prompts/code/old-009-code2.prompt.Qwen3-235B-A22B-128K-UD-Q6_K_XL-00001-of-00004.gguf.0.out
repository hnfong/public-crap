To perform a **binary search on a text file** directly (without loading all the data into memory), we can use a **file pointer-based approach** that mimics the behavior of `bisect.bisect_left` in Python. This is useful when the file is too large to load into memory but is stored in a sorted order.

### Key Considerations:
- The file is **sorted lexicographically**.
- Each line contains a **single name**.
- We want to find the **position (line number)** of the `target` name or the **insertion point** if it's not present.
- We must use **at most O(log n)** operations â€” so we must avoid reading the whole file.

### Strategy:
1. Use file pointers to move around the file without loading all of it into memory.
2. Perform binary search by:
   - Moving to the middle of the current file segment.
   - Reading the name at that line.
   - Comparing it with the target.
3. Since we can't jump directly to a line (unless we know the line lengths), we'll instead:
   - Estimate the line length.
   - Use byte offsets to approximate line positions.
   - Read lines carefully to ensure we're at the start of a line.

### Python Function:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    import os

    def find_line_start(f, pos):
        """ Move file pointer to the start of the line containing position `pos`. """
        while pos > 0:
            pos -= 1
            f.seek(pos)
            if f.read(1) == '\n':
                f.seek(pos + 1)
                return pos + 1
        f.seek(0)
        return 0

    def get_line_at(f, offset):
        """ Read a line from the file at the given offset. """
        f.seek(offset)
        return f.readline().rstrip('\n')

    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        low = 0
        f.seek(0, os.SEEK_END)
        high = f.tell()  # total size of the file in bytes

        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            find_line_start(f, mid)
            line = f.readline().rstrip('\n')
            if not line:
                # End of file reached, move back
                high = mid
                continue
            if line < target:
                low = f.tell()
            else:
                high = mid

        # After loop, low is the insertion point or match
        # Now count the number of lines before low to get the line number
        f.seek(0)
        line_number = 0
        while True:
            pos = f.tell()
            line = f.readline()
            if not line or pos >= low:
                break
            line_number += 1
        return line_number
```

### How It Works:
- `find_line_start()` ensures we're at the beginning of a line when we read from a byte offset.
- `get_line_at()` reads the line starting at a given byte offset.
- The binary search is performed using byte offsets (`low`, `high`) rather than line numbers.
- At the end, we count how many lines are before the final `low` byte offset to determine the **line number** (i.e., the "bisect_left" position).

### Example Usage:

```python
position = binary_search_file('names.txt', 'John')
print(f"Target should be at or inserted before line: {position}")
```

### Notes:
- This function assumes that the file is **sorted** and each **line contains one name**.
- It avoids loading the entire file into memory and uses only file I/O operations.
- It returns the **line number** (0-based), which is the same as the `bisect_left` behavior.

### Limitations:
- It assumes lines are roughly the same length for efficiency, though it handles variable-length lines correctly.
- It may not be as fast as in-memory binary search but is memory-efficient.

Let me know if you'd like a version that returns the byte offset instead of the line number. [end of text]
