Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Yes, the program will print "Done" when the input is a positive number that is less than 1. Here are two examples:

1. If you enter `0.5` as the input, the program will keep adding `0.5` to `x` until `x` becomes infinity, but since `x` is a float, it will never reach infinity. Therefore, the program will print "Done".

2. If you enter `0.1` as the input, the program will keep adding `0.1` to `x` until `x` becomes infinity. Again, since `x` is a float, it will never reach infinity, and the program will print "Done".

In both cases, the program will run indefinitely, but it will never actually reach infinity due to the precision limits of floating-point numbers in Python.
