To perform a binary search on a file directly, we can use the following steps:

1. Open the file and get its size.
2. Initialize the left and right pointers to the beginning and end of the file, respectively.
3. While the left pointer is less than or equal to the right pointer:
   a. Calculate the middle position as the average of the left and right pointers.
   b. Seek to the middle position in the file and read the line at that position.
   c. If the line is empty, move the middle position to the next line and read the line again.
   d. Compare the line with the target. If the line is equal to the target, return the middle position.
   e. If the line is less than the target, move the left pointer to the middle position + 1.
   f. If the line is greater than the target, move the right pointer to the middle position - 1.
4. If the target is not found, return the left pointer as the insertion point.

Here is the Python function that implements the above steps:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        left = 0
        right = f.seek(0, 2) - 1  # get the size of the file
        while left <= right:
            middle = (left + right) // 2
            f.seek(middle)
            # read the line at the middle position
            line = ''
            while middle < right and f.read(1) != '\n':
                middle += 1
            line = f.readline()
            if not line:
                # if the line is empty, move to the next line
                middle += 1
                f.seek(middle)
                line = f.readline()
            if line == target:
                return middle
            elif line < target:
                left = middle + 1
            else:
                right = middle - 1
        return left
```

Note that this function assumes that the file is sorted in lexicographical order and that each line contains a single name. Also, the function returns the position of the target in the file, or the insertion point if the target is not found. [end of text]
