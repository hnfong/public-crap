<think>
Okay, let's see. I need to write a Python function called abbrev_num that takes an integer and returns a compact string representation with up to 4 characters.

First, the examples given: 2 becomes "2", 8180 is "8.2K", 9385832 is "9.4M". Also, 74581 should be "75K" instead of "74.5K" because of the 4-character limit.

So the main idea is to abbreviate numbers using K for thousands, M for millions, B for billions, etc., rounding to one or two significant digits, but keeping the string length ≤4.

Wait, the output must be <=4 characters. Let's check the examples:

- 2 is 1 character, which is fine.
- 8.2K is 4 characters (8, ., 2, K). Oh right, 4 characters.
- 75K is 3 characters (7,5,K), which is under 4.

Wait, 74.5K would be 5 characters (7,4,.,5,K), which is why it's not allowed. So the function needs to choose between using one decimal place or none, depending on what fits.

So the strategy is: for numbers less than 1000, just return the number as a string.

For numbers >= 1000, we need to divide by 1000, 1e6, 1e9, etc., and choose the appropriate suffix (K, M, B, ...).

But how to handle the rounding and the number of decimal places to keep the string within 4 characters.

Let's think about possible cases.

Case 1: x < 1000. Then output is str(x). For example, 2 → "2", 999 → "999". But 999 is 3 characters, which is okay.

Case 2: 1000 ≤ x < 10,000. Let's take 8180. 8180 / 1000 = 8.18 → rounded to 8.2, so "8.2K" (4 chars). But if the number is 74581, which is 74.581K. Rounding to 75K (two digits, no decimal) gives "75K" (3 chars), which is better than "74.6K" (4 chars? Let's see: 7,4,.,6,K → 5 characters. Wait, 74.6K is 5 characters. So to fit into 4, maybe 75K is 3, which is allowed.

Wait, the problem says output should be <=4 characters if possible. So for 74581, 75K is 3 characters, which is under 4, so that's acceptable.

Wait, but how do we decide when to use one decimal place or none?

Let's think about the possible formats:

- For numbers between 1,000 and 9,999: e.g., 8180 → 8.2K (4 chars). If it's 9999, then 10.0K would be 5 chars, but 10K is 3 chars. Wait, 9999 is 9.999K, which rounds to 10K (3 chars). So for numbers where the abbreviated value is >=10, we can drop the decimal.

Wait, perhaps the approach is:

For each order of magnitude (K, M, B, etc.), compute the value divided by the magnitude.

If the value is less than 10, we can have one decimal place (e.g., 8.2K), which is 4 characters (digits + '.' + digit + suffix).

If the value is 10 or more, then we can round to the nearest integer, so two digits (e.g., 75K), which is 3 characters (two digits + K).

Wait, let's check:

For example, 9999 is 9.999K → rounds to 10K (3 chars).

Another example: 12345 is 12.345K → rounds to 12K (3 chars).

But 8180 is 8.18K → rounds to 8.2K (4 chars).

So the rule seems to be: if the abbreviated number (after dividing by the magnitude) is less than 10, we can have one decimal place (so total 4 chars: X.XK), but if it's 10 or more, we round to integer (so XXK, which is 3 chars).

Wait, but 9.99K would be 9.99 → rounds to 10.0K, but that's 5 chars. Wait, no. Wait, 9999 is 9.999K, which rounds to 10K (3 chars). So perhaps when the value after division is >= 9.95, it rounds up to 10.0, but then we can represent it as 10K.

Wait, perhaps the approach is:

For each magnitude (K, M, etc.), compute the value as x / magnitude.

If the value is less than 10, then we can format it with one decimal place (so X.X), which gives 3 characters (X.X) plus the suffix (1 char), total 4.

If the value is 10 or more, then we format it as an integer (XX), which is 2 digits plus suffix (1 char), total 3.

But wait, what about numbers like 999,999? 999,999 is 0.999999 million, so it would be 1.0M (4 chars). Wait, 999,999 is 999.999K, which would be 1000K, but that's not right. Wait, no: 999,999 is 999.999 thousand, which is 1.0 million. So 999,999 → 1.0M (4 chars).

Wait, perhaps the steps are:

1. Determine the appropriate suffix (K, M, B, T, etc.) based on the magnitude.

2. Divide the number by the corresponding factor (1e3, 1e6, 1e9, etc.)

3. Round the result to two significant digits, but adjust the number of decimal places to fit within 4 characters.

Wait, but how to handle the rounding.

Alternative approach:

Check the number of digits.

For example:

- If x < 1000: return str(x)

- Else if x < 10,000: divide by 1000, round to one decimal → X.XK (4 chars)

Wait, 8180 is 8.18 → 8.2K (4 chars)

But 9999 is 9.999 → 10.0K, but that's 5 chars. Wait, no: 9.999 rounded to one decimal is 10.0, but 10.0K is 5 characters (1,0,.,0,K). So that's a problem.

Ah, so in this case, when the rounded value is 10.0, we need to represent it as 10K (without the decimal), which is 3 characters.

So perhaps the logic is:

After dividing by the magnitude, if the value is less than 10, we can have one decimal place (so X.X), but if it's 10 or more, we use no decimal places (XX).

Wait, but how to handle the transition.

Let's think of possible ranges:

For K (1e3):

- 1,000 to 9,999: value is 1.0 to 9.999. So when rounded to one decimal, it's X.X, which is 3 characters (X.X) plus K → 4 total.

But when the value is 9.95 or higher, rounding to one decimal would give 10.0, which would require 10K (3 chars) instead.

Wait, for example, 9950 is 9.95K. Rounded to one decimal place, it's 10.0K, but that's 5 characters. So instead, we should round to the nearest integer, giving 10K (3 chars).

So perhaps the rule is: if the value after division is less than 9.95, then use one decimal place (X.X), else round to integer (XX).

Wait, but how to determine when to switch.

Alternative approach: for each magnitude, compute the value, then check how many characters the formatted string would be.

For example, for value v:

If v < 10:

- Format as "{:.1f}".format(v) → this gives X.X (3 chars), plus suffix (1) → total 4.

But if v is 9.95, then formatting as X.X would give 10.0, which is 4 chars (1,0,.,0) plus K → 5 chars. So that's bad.

Wait, 9.95 rounded to one decimal is 10.0. So the string would be "10.0K", which is 5 characters. Which exceeds the limit.

So in this case, we need to round to the nearest integer, giving "10K" (3 chars).

So the problem arises when the value after division is >= 9.95, because rounding to one decimal would push it to 10.0, which is too long.

Therefore, perhaps the correct approach is:

For each magnitude:

- Compute v = x / magnitude

- If v < 10:

   - Round to one decimal place. If the rounded value is >= 10 (e.g., 9.95 rounds to 10.0), then use the next magnitude (but that's not possible here, since we're already in the correct magnitude). Wait, no. For example, 9950 is 9.95K. Rounding to one decimal gives 10.0K, but 10.0K is 10,000, which is correct. However, the string "10.0K" is 5 characters, which is too long. So instead, we should represent it as "10K".

So perhaps, when v is between 9.95 and 10, we round to 10 and use no decimal places.

So the logic could be:

If v < 9.5:

   format as X.X

Else:

   round to integer, format as XX

Wait, but 9.5 would round to 10 when using one decimal? Let's see: 9.5 rounded to one decimal is 9.5. Wait, no. Wait, if we're rounding to one decimal place, 9.5 is already one decimal. Wait, perhaps the rounding is to one decimal place, but if that causes the integer part to increase (like 9.95 → 10.0), then we need to adjust.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is:

For numbers where the abbreviated value (v) is less than 10:

   We can have one decimal place, but only if the total length is <=4.

Wait, the total length is len(str(v rounded to 1 decimal)) + 1 (for the suffix).

Wait, for example:

v = 8.2 → "8.2" is 3 characters, plus "K" → 4.

v = 9.9 → "9.9" is 3, plus K → 4.

v = 9.95 → rounded to 10.0, which is "10.0" (4 chars) plus K → 5, which is too long. So in this case, we need to round to 10 and use "10K" (3 chars).

So the rule is: if rounding v to one decimal place results in a number that has two digits before the decimal (i.e., >=10.0), then we should round to integer and use no decimal.

So how to check that.

For example:

v = 9.95 → when rounded to one decimal, it's 10.0. So the integer part is 10, which is two digits. So in this case, we should format as integer.

So perhaps:

Compute v_rounded_1 = round(v, 1)

If v_rounded_1 >= 10.0:

   use integer rounding (round to 0 decimals)

Else:

   use 1 decimal

But how to handle this in code.

Alternatively, after rounding to one decimal, check if the integer part is >=10. If yes, then round to integer.

Wait, for example:

v = 9.95 → round to 1 decimal is 10.0. The integer part is 10, which is two digits. So we need to round to integer (10) and format as "10K".

Similarly, v = 9.94 → round to 9.9, which is okay.

So the steps could be:

For a given magnitude:

1. Compute v = x / magnitude

2. Round v to one decimal place: v1 = round(v, 1)

3. If v1 >= 10.0:

   a. Round v to integer: v_int = round(v)

   b. Format as str(v_int) + suffix

4. Else:

   a. Format as "{:.1f}".format(v1) + suffix

But wait, what if v is 9.95, which rounds to 10.0. Then v_int is 10, so "10K" (3 chars).

Another example: v=9.5 → round to 9.5 (one decimal), which is okay. So "9.5K" (4 chars).

But 9.5 is allowed.

Wait, 9.5 is 3 characters (9.5) plus K → 4.

Yes.

Another example: v=9.94 → 9.9K (4 chars).

v=9.95 → 10K (3 chars).

This seems to handle the edge case.

Now, what about numbers that when rounded to one decimal are exactly 10.0?

Like v=9.95, which rounds to 10.0.

So the code would check if v1 >=10.0, then use integer.

Now, what about numbers that are exactly 10.0? Like x=10,000. Then v=10.0. So v1=10.0, which is >=10.0, so we use integer rounding (10), so "10K".

Which is correct.

Another example: x=12345 → 12.345K → v=12.345. Since v >=10, we round to 12K.

Wait, but according to the previous logic, for v >=10, we should round to integer.

Wait, but how do we determine the magnitude.

Wait, the magnitude is determined first.

Wait, the first step is to find the correct suffix.

So the steps are:

1. Determine the order of magnitude (how many times to divide by 1000).

For example:

- 0-999: no suffix

- 1,000-999,999: K

- 1,000,000-999,999,999: M

- etc.

So for x, we can compute the magnitude by taking log10(x) / 3, then floor it.

But perhaps easier to check ranges.

But for code, perhaps:

if x < 1000:

   return str(x)

elif x < 10**6:

   magnitude = 1e3

   suffix = 'K'

elif x < 1e9:

   magnitude = 1e6

   suffix = 'M'

elif x < 1e12:

   magnitude = 1e9

   suffix = 'B'

else:

   magnitude = 1e12

   suffix = 'T'

But need to handle up to whatever, but the problem examples go up to M.

But the problem says "roughly represents the number", so perhaps up to B or T.

But the code should handle all possible integers.

But for the purpose of this problem, perhaps the main cases are K, M, B.

Now, once the magnitude and suffix are determined, compute v = x / magnitude.

Then, as discussed, check if v < 10.

Wait, no. Because for example, x=999,999 is 0.999999 million, so magnitude is 1e6, v=0.999999, which is less than 1. So in that case, it's better to use K.

Wait, no. Wait, 999,999 is 999.999K, which is better represented as 1.0M.

Ah, right. So the magnitude should be the largest possible where v >=1.

Wait, for example, 999,999 is 999.999K, but since 999.999K is almost 1M, it's better to represent as 1.0M.

So the correct approach is to find the largest magnitude where v >= 1.

Wait, for x=999,999:

Check if x >= 1e6 (1,000,000)? No, 999,999 < 1e6. So magnitude is 1e3 (K), v=999.999.

But 999.999K is 999,999, which is correct, but the problem is that 999.999K would need to be rounded to 1000K, but that's not standard. Instead, it's better to use M.

Wait, no. 1,000,000 is 1M. So 999,999 is 0.999999M, which is less than 1, so we should use K.

Wait, but 999,999 is 999.999K, which is 1000K when rounded, but 1000K is 1M. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the largest magnitude where v >= 1 after rounding.

Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternative approach: find the highest magnitude (K, M, B, etc.) such that x >= magnitude.

Wait, for example:

x=999,999:

Check if x >= 1e6 (1,000,000)? No. So next lower magnitude is 1e3 (K). So v = 999,999 / 1e3 = 999.999.

But 999.999 is >= 100, so we need to see if we can use a higher magnitude.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to divide by 1000 until the value is less than 1000.

Wait, for example:

x = 999999

Divide by 1000 once: 999.999 → which is less than 1000, so magnitude is K, suffix K.

But 999.999K is 999,999, which is correct.

But when formatting, 999.999K would need to be rounded. However, 999.999 is almost 1000, so rounding to 1000K, but 1000K is 1M. So perhaps the correct suffix is M.

Ah, this is a problem. So the magnitude selection needs to ensure that the value after division is at least 1.

Wait, for example, 999,999 is 0.999999 million, which is less than 1, so we shouldn't use M. So the correct suffix is K.

But 999.999K is 999,999, which is correct, but when rounding, 999.999K rounds to 1000K, which is 1M. So perhaps the code should check if after rounding, the value reaches the next magnitude.

This complicates things.

Alternative idea: the magnitude is determined by the largest power of 1000 that is <= x.

Wait, for x=999,999, the largest power of 1000 <= x is 1000^1 = 1000 (since 1000^2 = 1,000,000 > 999,999). So magnitude is 1e3, suffix K.

But 999,999 / 1e3 = 999.999, which is the value to format.

But 999.999 is more than 100, so when formatting, how?

Wait, according to the problem statement, the output should be <=4 characters.

For 999,999, the value is 999.999K. Rounding to two significant digits: 1000K, but that's 4 characters (1,0,0,0,K → no, 1000K is 5 characters). Wait, but 1000K is not standard; it's better to use 1.0M.

Ah, so perhaps the magnitude selection should be such that the value after division is between 1 and 999.999..., but when formatting, we want it to be between 1 and 999, but rounded to two significant digits.

Wait, this is getting too vague.

Let's look back at the examples given.

The example input 9385832 → 9.4M.

9385832 is 9,385,832.

Divided by 1e6 (M) is 9.385832 → rounded to 9.4 → "9.4M" (4 chars).

Another example: 74581 → 74.581K → rounded to 75K (3 chars).

So the magnitude is chosen such that the value after division is at least 1.

For 74581, 74581 / 1e3 = 74.581, which is >=1, so K is the correct suffix.

For 9385832, 9,385,832 / 1e6 = 9.385832, so M is correct.

For 999,999: 999,999 / 1e3 = 999.999 → which is >=1, so K is the suffix. But 999.999K would need to be rounded. However, 999.999 is almost 1000, so rounding to 1000K, but 1000K is 1M. So perhaps in this case, the code should use M as the suffix.

Wait, but 999,999 is less than 1,000,000, so it's not a full million. But when rounded, 999.999K rounds to 1000K, which is 1M. So the correct representation would be 1.0M.

Ah, so the magnitude selection should take into account the rounded value.

This complicates things, but perhaps the correct approach is:

Find the largest magnitude (K, M, B, etc.) such that when x is divided by magnitude, the result is >= 0.95 (so that when rounded, it becomes >=1.0).

Wait, for example, x=999,999:

Check if x >= 0.95 * 1e6 (950,000). Yes. So divide by 1e6: 0.999999. Rounded to one decimal is 1.0. So the suffix is M, and the value is 1.0.

Thus, "1.0M" (4 chars).

But 999,999 is less than 1e6, but when rounded, it's 1.0M.

So the magnitude selection should be based on the rounded value.

This suggests that the magnitude is determined by the order of magnitude of the rounded value.

Alternative plan:

1. Determine the order of magnitude by finding the largest power of 1000 such that x >= 0.95 * (magnitude * 1000). Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, compute the exponent as floor(log10(x)/3), but adjusted for rounding.

But perhaps a better way is:

Compute the number of times you can divide by 1000 before the value is less than 1.

Wait, for x=999,999:

log10(999999) ≈ 5.9999956, divided by 3 is ~1.9999985, floor is 1. So magnitude is 1000^1 = 1e3.

But when divided by 1e3, it's 999.999, which is almost 1000, so rounding to 1000, which is 1e3 * 1e3 = 1e6, so magnitude should be 1e6.

This suggests that the initial magnitude selection is not sufficient.

Hmm.

Perhaps the correct approach is:

Find the largest n such that x >= 1000^n * 0.95.

Wait, for x=999,999:

Check n=2: 1000^2 = 1e6. 0.95 * 1e6 = 950,000. x=999,999 >= 950,000 → yes. So n=2.

Then magnitude is 1e6, v = 999,999 / 1e6 = 0.999999. Rounded to one decimal is 1.0. So "1.0M".

Yes, this works.

Similarly, x=950,000: 950,000 / 1e6 = 0.95 → rounds to 1.0M.

x=949,999: 949,999 / 1e6 = 0.949999 → rounds to 0.9, but 0.9 is less than 1, so we should use K.

Wait, 0.949999M is 949.999K. Rounded to one decimal: 950.0K. But 950.0K is 5 characters. So we need to round to 950K (4 chars? 9,5,0,K → 4 chars). Wait, 950K is 4 characters (9,5,0,K). But the problem says output should be <=4 characters if possible.

Wait, 950K is 4 characters. So for x=949,999, which is 949.999K, rounding to 950K (4 chars) is acceptable.

But according to the previous logic, if we use M, it's 0.95M, which rounds to 1.0M (4 chars). But 0.95 is exactly the threshold.

Wait, this is getting too complicated.

Alternative idea inspired by existing libraries:

In many abbreviation systems, numbers are formatted with the largest suffix such that the value is at least 1. For example, 999,999 is 999.999K, which is formatted as 1000K, but since 1000K is 1M, it's better to use 1.0M.

So the correct approach is to find the largest suffix where the value after division is >= 1 after rounding.

But how to implement this.

Perhaps the steps are:

1. For each possible suffix in ['','K','M','B','T'], compute the value v = x / (1000^i), where i is the index (0 for '', 1 for K, etc.)

2. Find the largest i where v >= 1 (after rounding to two significant digits).

Wait, but this may not be straightforward.

Alternative approach from existing code examples:

Looking up how other people solve this problem.

For example, in JavaScript, a common approach is:

function abbreviateNumber(value) {
    var newValue = value;
    if (value >= 1000) {
        var suffixes = ["", "K", "M", "B","T"];
        var suffixNum = Math.floor( (""+value).length/3 );
        var shortValue = '';
        for (var precision = 2; precision >= 1; precision--) {
            shortValue = parseFloat( (suffixNum != 0 ? (value / Math.pow(1000,suffixNum)) : value).toPrecision(precision));
            var shortValueStr = shortValue+"";
            if (shortValueStr.length <= 2) {break;}
        }
        newValue = shortValue+suffixes[suffixNum];
    }
    return newValue;
}

But this may not handle all cases.

Alternatively, another approach:

Determine the suffix based on the number of digits.

For example:

- 0-999: no suffix

- 1,000-999,999: K

- 1,000,000-999,999,999: M

But then, for numbers like 999,999, it's in the K range, but when rounded, it becomes 1000K which is 1M.

So perhaps after determining the initial suffix, check if the rounded value is >= 1000, and if so, increment the suffix.

But this could get complicated.

Let's think of the problem constraints again.

The output must be <=4 characters.

Possible formats:

- Up to 3 digits with no suffix: e.g., "999" (3 chars)

- X.X suffix: e.g., "8.2K" (4 chars)

- XX suffix: e.g., "75K" (3 chars)

- XXX suffix: but that would be 4 chars, e.g., "999K" is 4 chars (9,9,9,K). Wait, 999K is 4 characters. But 999,000 is 999K. However, 999K is 4 characters, which is allowed.

Wait, the problem says "output string should be <=4 characters if at all possible".

So for x=999,000, the output could be "999K" (4 chars), which is acceptable.

But according to the examples given, 74581 is "75K" (3 chars) instead of "74.5K" (5 chars). Wait, 74.5K is 5 characters (7,4,.,5,K), which is why it's not allowed.

So for numbers where the abbreviated value is between 10 and 99.9, we can have two digits and the suffix (e.g., 75K), which is 3 chars.

For numbers between 100 and 999.9, we can have three digits and the suffix (e.g., 999K), which is 4 chars.

Wait, 999K is 4 characters (9,9,9,K). Yes.

So the possible cases for suffix K:

- 1-9.9: X.XK (4 chars)

- 10-99.9: XXK (3 chars)

- 100-999.9: XXXK (4 chars)

Ah! So for example:

- 8180 → 8.2K (4 chars)

- 74581 → 75K (3 chars)

- 999,000 → 999K (4 chars)

But 999,500 would be 1000K, but that's 1M. So 999,500 → 1.0M (4 chars).

So the key is to determine the correct suffix and then format the number to fit within 4 characters.

So the steps are:

1. Determine the appropriate suffix (K, M, B, etc.) based on the value.

2. Divide the number by the corresponding factor.

3. Round the result to 1, 2, or 3 significant digits, but ensuring the total string length (including suffix) is <=4.

Wait, but how to decide how many significant digits to use.

Let's think of the possible cases for each suffix:

For a given suffix (e.g., K), the value v = x / factor.

We need to format v such that len(str(v)) + 1 (for suffix) <=4.

So len(str(v)) <=3.

Possible formats for v:

- If v < 10: can have one decimal place (X.X) → 3 chars (e.g., 8.2)

- If 10 <= v < 100: can have no decimal places (XX) → 2 chars (e.g., 75)

- If 100 <= v < 1000: can have no decimal places (XXX) → 3 chars (e.g., 999)

But wait, 999 is 3 chars, plus suffix is 4.

Yes.

So the rules are:

- If v < 10: round to 1 decimal place (X.X)

- Else if v < 100: round to integer (XX)

- Else if v < 1000: round to integer (XXX)

But wait, for v=999.4, rounding to integer is 999, which is 3 chars → "999K" (4 chars).

For v=999.5, rounding to 1000, which would be 1.0 of the next suffix.

Ah, right. So when v >= 1000, we need to use the next suffix.

Wait, but v is x / factor. So if v >= 1000, that means x >= factor * 1000, which is the next suffix.

So the initial suffix selection should ensure that v < 1000.

Wait, this is key.

The correct suffix is the largest such that v = x / factor >= 1.

But to ensure that v < 1000.

For example:

x=999,999:

factor=1e3 (K), v=999.999 < 1000 → correct suffix.

x=1,000,000:

factor=1e6 (M), v=1.0.

So the suffix is chosen such that 1 <= v < 1000.

Once that is done, then:

- If v < 10: format as X.X

- Else if v < 100: format as XX

- Else: format as XXX

But wait, for v=999.4, it's 999, which is 3 chars → "999K" (4 chars).

For v=999.5, it rounds to 1000, which is >=1000, so we need to use the next suffix.

Ah, so during the rounding step, if rounding causes v to reach 1000, we need to increment the suffix.

For example, x=999,500:

v = 999.5 (K), which rounds to 1000K → which is 1.0M.

So the correct suffix is M, and v=1.0.

Thus, the steps are:

1. Determine the initial suffix such that 1 <= v < 1000.

2. Round v to the appropriate number of digits (based on the ranges), but if rounding causes v to reach 1000, then increment the suffix and set v=1.0.

This complicates things, but perhaps manageable.

Let's outline the algorithm:

def abbrev_num(x):
    if x < 1000:
        return str(x)
    
    # Determine the suffix and magnitude
    suffixes = ['', 'K', 'M', 'B', 'T']
    magnitude = 1
    suffix_index = 0
    while x >= 1000 * magnitude:
        magnitude *= 1000
        suffix_index += 1
    
    # Now, magnitude is the largest such that x >= magnitude (e.g., for x=8180, magnitude=1000, suffix_index=1)
    v = x / magnitude
    
    # Now, v is in [1, 1000)
    
    # Check if rounding v to the appropriate precision would push it to 1000
    # First, determine how to round based on v's range
    
    if v < 10:
        # Format to 1 decimal place
        rounded_v = round(v, 1)
        # Check if rounded_v is >= 10 (e.g., 9.95 rounds to 10.0)
        if rounded_v >= 10.0:
            # Need to increment suffix
            rounded_v = 10.0
            # But 10.0 is for the next magnitude
            # So we need to adjust suffix_index and magnitude
            # Wait, but how?
            # For example, v=9.95K (x=9950), rounded to 10.0K, which is 10,000, which is 10K, but 10K is still in the same magnitude.
            # Wait, no: 10.0K is 10,000, which is still in the K magnitude (since 10,000 < 1,000,000).
            # So suffix_index remains the same.
            # But 10.0K as a string is "10.0K" which is 5 chars, which is invalid.
            # So instead, we should round to integer: 10K.
            # So in this case, even though v <10, after rounding to 1 decimal it's >=10, so we need to round to integer.
            # So perhaps the correct approach is:
            # If rounding to 1 decimal gives >=10, then round to integer.
            rounded_v = round(v)
            # Now, check if rounded_v is >= 1000, but since v <10, rounded_v is at most 10 (if v=9.95 rounds to 10)
            # So rounded_v is 10, which is <1000.
            # Format as integer.
            s = str(int(rounded_v)) + suffixes[suffix_index]
        else:
            s = "{:.1f}".format(rounded_v).rstrip('0').rstrip('.') + suffixes[suffix_index]
            # But need to ensure that the decimal is handled correctly. For example, 8.0 becomes "8", but we want "8.0"?
            # Wait, no. For v=8.0, we want "8.0K" but that's 4 chars. However, "8K" is shorter. But according to the problem statement, the example 8180 is "8.2K", which uses one decimal.
            # So for v=8.0, it should be "8.0K" (4 chars), but maybe the problem expects "8K" (2 chars). But the problem says "roughly
