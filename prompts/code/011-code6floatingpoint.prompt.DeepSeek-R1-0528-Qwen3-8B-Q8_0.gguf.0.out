<think>
We are using IEEE 754 double-precision floating point (which Python uses by default for `float`).
 In Q1, we start with x = 0.0 and add 1.0 until x becomes infinity.

 However, note that floating point numbers have a finite range. The maximum finite positive number in double precision is about 1.797693133806e+308.
 When we keep adding 1.0, we will eventually reach a point where x becomes so large that adding 1.0 doesn't change it (because of rounding).
 But note: the condition is `x < math.inf`. The loop will break when x becomes infinity.

 Let's think: the loop condition is checked at the beginning of each iteration. We start with x=0.0 and then add 1.0 until x is no longer less than infinity.

 However, the issue is that when x becomes very large, the addition of 1.0 might not change the value due to rounding. But note that the condition is `x < math.inf` and `math.inf` is a very large number.

 The problem is that the loop condition is always true until x becomes infinity. But when x is already at the maximum finite value, adding 1.0 will cause an overflow, setting x to infinity.

 But wait, let's check the behavior:

 In IEEE 754, when a floating point operation results in a number that is too large, it becomes infinity. However, the addition of 1.0 to a very large number (like the maximum finite value) might not necessarily overflow because the maximum finite value is about 1e308 and 1.0 is much smaller. But note: the maximum finite value is so large that adding 1.0 to it does not change the value (because the next representable number is the same). However, the condition `x < math.inf` is still true until x becomes infinity.

 Actually, the loop will run until x becomes infinity. But how does x become infinity? By adding 1.0 to the maximum finite value, which is not allowed without overflow. However, note that the maximum finite value is not the only one that can cause overflow. We can also exceed it by multiplication or other operations.

 But in this case, we are adding 1.0. The maximum finite value for double is about 1.797693133806e+308. Let's calculate how many times we can add 1.0 until we get there.

 However, note that the loop condition is `x < math.inf`. The program will break when x becomes infinity. But when does x become infinity? When we try to add 1.0 to the current x and the result exceeds the maximum finite value, then it becomes infinity.

 But the maximum finite value is so huge that we would need to add 1.0 about 1.797693133806e+308 times. That is an enormous number of iterations. The program will not run to completion in practice because it would take too long.

 However, the question is about the eventual output. The program will print the current value of x when the loop breaks. But note: the loop breaks when x becomes infinity, so the output will be `inf`.

 But wait, what if we don't actually reach the maximum finite value? We start at 0 and add 1 each time. The maximum finite value is about 1e308, so we would have to do about 1e308 iterations. This is impossible in practice because of time and memory constraints, but in theory, the program will output `inf`.

 However, note that the condition is `x < math.inf`. The first time x becomes infinity, the condition fails and the loop breaks. So the output is `inf`.

 But let's consider: what is the maximum finite value? It is `math.inf`? Actually, `math.inf` is the representation of infinity, and the maximum finite value is `math.finfo(float).max`. However, note that `math.inf` is a special value and the condition `x < math.inf` is true for all finite numbers and false for infinity.

 So the program will run until x becomes infinity, which happens when we try to add 1.0 to the current x and the result is too large. The output will be `inf`.

 However, note that the program might break due to reaching the maximum integer value that can be represented in the exponent? Actually, the loop condition is checked with `math.inf` which is a float. The variable x is a float and the addition is done in floating point.

 But there's a catch: the loop condition is `x < math.inf`. The value of `math.inf` is a very large positive infinity. The loop will break when x becomes infinity, but note that the condition is checked at the beginning of the loop. So if we start with x being a finite number and then in the body we set x to infinity, then the next condition check will break the loop.

 However, the way the loop is written, we are adding 1.0 until x is less than infinity. The last operation that sets x to infinity is the one that breaks the condition for the next iteration.

 But note: the program does not break until the condition fails. So let's simulate:

 Step 1: x = 0.0, condition 0.0 < inf -> True, then x becomes 1.0.
 Step 2: x = 1.0, condition True, then x becomes 2.0.
 ...
 Step n: x = n, condition True until n is so large that adding 1.0 causes an overflow.

 However, the condition is checked at the beginning of the loop. So when x is already at the maximum finite value (say M), then we check if M < inf -> True, then we do x = M + 1.0. This operation will set x to inf (because M+1 is not representable and becomes inf). Then the loop breaks and we print inf.

 But note: the condition is `x < math.inf` and `math.inf` is positive infinity. The maximum finite value is less than positive infinity, so the condition holds until x becomes infinity.

 Therefore, the output is `inf`.

 However, note that the program might not run because of the huge number of iterations. But the question is about the eventual output, so we assume it runs until it breaks.

 But wait, what if the system does not allow such a large number of iterations? Then the program might be terminated by the system. However, the question is about the output of the program when it eventually breaks, so we are to assume that it does break and then print.

 So the answer for Q1 is: the program will output `inf`.

---

Q2.
We start with x = 1.0 and multiply by 1.001 each time until x becomes infinity.

 The condition is `x < math.inf`. The loop breaks when x becomes infinity.

 How many iterations? We are multiplying by 1.001 each time. The number of iterations required to reach infinity is the number of times we can multiply 1.0 by 1.001 until the product exceeds the maximum finite value.

 The maximum finite value is about 1.797693133806e+308.

 We can calculate the number of iterations needed:

 Let n be the number of iterations. Then x = 1.0 * (1.001)^n.

 We need (1.001)^n >= 1.797693133806e+308.

 Taking natural logarithm:

 n * ln(1.001) >= ln(1.797693133806e+308)

 ln(1.001) is approximately 0.0009995 (since ln(1+x) ≈ x for small x).

 ln(1.797693133806e+308) is approximately 308 * ln(10) + ln(1.797693133806) ≈ 308 * 2.302585 + 0.584 ≈ 708.7.

 So n >= 708.7 / 0.0009995 ≈ 708,700,000,000,000,000,000,000 (a very large number, but finite).

 The program will break after about 708.7e18 iterations, which is still an enormous number and will not run in practice.

 However, the output will be `inf` because the loop breaks when x becomes infinity.

 But note: the program in Q2 is similar to Q1, but with multiplication. The output is the same: `inf`.

 However, the question asks: "Is it different from the results above?" (referring to Q1). The result above (Q1) was `inf`. So the output is the same.

 But wait, let's consider the possibility of underflow? No, because we are multiplying and the numbers are increasing. We are only concerned with overflow.

 So the answer for Q2 is: the program outputs `inf`, which is the same as Q1.

 However, note that the program in Q2 might break earlier if the multiplication causes an overflow. But the number of iterations is still huge.

 But there's a nuance: in Q1, we are adding 1.0 until we get to infinity. In Q2, we are multiplying by 1.001. The condition is the same, so the output is the same.

 But note: the program in Q2 might break due to the multiplication by 1.001 causing an overflow at a slightly different point? Actually, the condition is `x < math.inf` and the loop breaks when x becomes infinity. The value of x in Q2 is increasing by a factor of 1.001 each time, so it will eventually exceed the maximum finite value and become infinity.

 Therefore, the output is `inf` for both.

 However, let me check with a smaller example to see if the behavior is the same.

 But note: the condition is the same, and the operation is such that x becomes infinity. So the output is the same.

 But wait, what if the program in Q2 breaks due to the exponent being too large? Actually, the same thing happens: the number becomes too large and overflows to infinity.

 So the answer is: the output is `inf` and it is the same as Q1.

---

Q3.
We are reading a float input and then adding it repeatedly until x becomes infinity.

 The question: are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"?

 Note: the program prints "Done" only if the loop breaks and then we print "Done". But the loop breaks when x becomes infinity, and then we print x (which is inf) and then the program ends. However, note that the program does not have a print statement for "Done" in the loop. Let me read the code again:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

 Actually, the program prints "Done" regardless of the input? Because the print("Done") is outside the loop. So the output is always "Done", unless the program crashes or the loop runs forever.

 But note: the loop condition is `x < math.inf`. The loop breaks when x becomes infinity. So if the loop breaks, we print "Done". If the loop runs forever, then we never print "Done".

 However, the question is: are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? The answer is: for any input that eventually leads to x becoming infinity, the output will be "Done". But note that the program might run forever for some inputs.

 Let's analyze:

 The loop breaks when x becomes infinity. We start with x=0.0 and add `inc` each time.

 If `inc` is 0.0, then x remains 0.0 and the loop runs forever (because 0.0 < inf is always true). So the output "Done" is never printed? Actually, the program will run indefinitely and then the user might have to stop it. But the question is about the eventual output.

 If `inc` is positive, then we are adding a positive number each time. The loop will break when x becomes infinity, and then we print "Done".

 If `inc` is negative, then we are adding a negative number. But note: the condition is `x < math.inf`. Since x starts at 0.0 and we add negative numbers, x will become negative and then we will keep adding negative numbers, so x will never become infinity. In fact, it will become -inf or underflow to a very small number (but note: the condition is `x < math.inf` and negative numbers are always less than positive infinity). So the loop will run forever because x will never reach infinity.

 However, note that the condition is `x < math.inf` and `math.inf` is positive infinity. The loop condition is always true for any finite number, including negative ones, and also for -inf (because -inf < inf is true). So if we add a negative number, the loop condition remains true and we keep adding, but x will become more and more negative until it underflows to -inf. Then the condition is still true because -inf < inf, so the loop continues. Then we try to add a negative number to -inf, which remains -inf. So the loop runs forever.

 Therefore, the program will print "Done" only if the loop breaks, i.e., if x becomes infinity. This happens if we are adding a positive number and eventually the sum exceeds the maximum finite value.

 But note: the input is a float. The smallest positive float is about 2.2e-308. If we add a very small positive number, it will take a huge number of iterations to reach infinity.

 However, the question asks for inputs that will lead to the output "Done". Since the program always prints "Done" after the loop breaks, we need an input that will cause the loop to break.

 So any positive input will eventually break the loop (if we run enough iterations) and print "Done". But note: the input must be positive because if it is negative, the loop runs forever.

 But wait, what if the input is positive but very small? Then we need a lot of iterations. However, the program will still break because the number of iterations is finite (though very large). So any positive input will work.

 However, note that the input must be such that the addition does not underflow to zero or something? Actually, no: even if the input is positive, we are adding it until we get to a very large number. The only issue is that the input must be positive.

 But what if the input is zero? Then we are adding zero each time. The loop condition is always true (0.0 < inf) and we never break. So we never print "Done".

 What if the input is a positive number but so large that after one addition we get to infinity? For example, if `inc` is greater than or equal to the maximum finite value (about 1.797693133806e+308), then:

   x = 0.0 + inc

   If inc is exactly the maximum finite value, then x becomes that value (finite) and then we check the condition: x < inf -> True, then we add again: x = max_finite + inc. This will cause an overflow and set x to inf. Then the loop breaks and we print "Done".

   But note: the condition is checked at the beginning of the loop. So the first time, x=0.0, condition true, then we add inc (which is max_finite) and x becomes max_finite. Then the next condition: max_finite < inf -> True, then we add again: max_finite + max_finite -> which is too large and becomes inf. Then the condition fails and we break.

   So even if the input is the maximum finite value, the program will break after two iterations and print "Done".

   However, if the input is exactly the maximum finite value, then the first addition sets x to that value, and then the second addition sets it to inf.

   But note: the maximum finite value is about 1.797693133806e+308. The input `inc` must be a float. The program will break if `inc` is positive and the cumulative sum becomes infinity.

   So the inputs that will lead to the output "Done" are any positive float.

   However, note that the program might break due to the input being too large and causing an overflow in the first addition? Actually, no: the first addition is 0.0 + inc. If inc is positive and less than or equal to the maximum finite value, then x becomes inc (which is finite). Then we check the condition again and add again.

   The only way the first addition causes an overflow is if inc is infinity or NaN? But note: the input is read as a float. If the user enters a string that cannot be converted, it will raise an exception. But if the user enters a number, then:

   - If the user enters a number that is NaN, then the condition `x < math.inf` (with x=0.0) is false because NaN is not less than anything. So the loop breaks and we print "Done".

   - If the user enters a number that is math.inf, then the condition `0.0 < math.inf` is true, then we do `x = 0.0 + math.inf` which is math.inf, then the condition `math.inf < math.inf` is false, so the loop breaks and we print "Done".

   But wait, the condition is `x < math.inf`. If x is math.inf, then the condition is false. So if the input is math.inf, then the first iteration:

        x = 0.0 + math.inf -> math.inf
        then condition: math.inf < math.inf -> False, so we break and print "Done".

   So even if the input is infinity, the program breaks and prints "Done".

   However, note that the condition is `x < math.inf`. The condition is false when x is infinity, so the loop breaks.

   Therefore, the program will break and print "Done" for any input that is positive (including zero? no, because zero doesn't break) or infinity or NaN.

   But wait, what about NaN? The condition `x < math.inf` with x being NaN is false because NaN is not comparable. So the loop breaks and we print "Done".

   However, note that the program does not check for NaN or infinity in the input. It just reads a float. So:

   - If the input is NaN, then the loop condition is checked with x=0.0 (which is finite) and then we set x = 0.0 + NaN -> NaN. Then the condition `NaN < math.inf` is false (because NaN is not less than anything) so the loop breaks and we print "Done".

   - If the input is math.inf, then the condition `0.0 < math.inf` is true, then we set x = 0.0 + math.inf -> math.inf, then the condition `math.inf < math.inf` is false, so the loop breaks and we print "Done".

   So the program will break and print "Done" for any input that is not zero and not a negative number? Actually, for any input that is not zero and not negative, because:

   - If the input is positive (including very small positive) then eventually the sum will become infinity (if we run enough iterations) and then the loop breaks.

   - If the input is NaN, then the condition fails and the loop breaks.

   - If the input is infinity, then the condition fails after the first iteration.

   But note: the input can be zero, then the loop runs forever and we never print "Done".

   Also, if the input is negative, then the loop runs forever (because we never reach infinity) and we never print "Done".

   However, the question asks for inputs that will lead to the output "Done". So we need to avoid the cases where the loop runs forever.

   Therefore, the inputs that will lead to the output "Done" are:

   - Any positive float (including very small positive, and including the maximum finite value, and including infinity)
   - NaN

   But note: the program might not run if the input is too large and causes an overflow in the first addition? Actually, the first addition is 0.0 + inc. If inc is infinity, then 0.0+infinity is infinity. If inc is NaN, then 0.0+NaN is NaN.

   So the program will break and print "Done" for any input that is not zero and not negative.

   However, note that the input can be a positive float that is so small that it takes a huge number of iterations to reach infinity. But the program will eventually break because the number of iterations is finite (though very large). So even a very small positive float will work.

   But what if the input is a positive float that is exactly the maximum finite value? Then:

        x = 0.0 + max_finite_value -> max_finite_value (finite)
        then condition: max_finite_value < inf -> True
        then x = max_finite_value + max_finite_value -> which is too large and becomes inf.

        Then the condition fails and we break.

   So that works.

   Therefore, two examples of inputs that will lead to the output "Done":

   Example 1: a positive number, say 1.0 (as in Q2, but note that in Q2 we used multiplication, here we use addition)

   Example 2: math.inf or a string that represents infinity (but note: the input is read as float, so if the user enters 'inf', it will be converted to math.inf)

   Example 3: NaN (if the user enters a string that cannot be converted, it will raise a ValueError. But if the user enters a string that is NaN, then it will be converted to NaN. However, note that the input function in Python for float does not accept NaN string by default? Actually, the string 'nan' is accepted and converted to NaN. But let's check:

        >>> float('nan')
        nan

   So if the user enters 'nan', then the input is NaN.

   But note: the program does not catch exceptions. So if the user enters a non-numeric string, the program will crash. However, the question says "if any" and "at least 2 examples", so we are to consider valid float inputs.

   So valid examples:

   Example 1: 1.0
   Example 2: math.inf (or the string 'inf')

   However, note that the program does not require the input to be a string. We can enter math.inf as a float? Actually, math.inf is a float. But the input function expects a string. So we can enter the string representation of math.inf, which is 'inf'.

   But wait, the program uses `float(input(...))`. So if the user enters a string that is not a valid representation of a float, it will raise a ValueError and the program will stop. So we must consider only valid float strings.

   The valid float strings are those that can be converted to a float. The string 'inf' is valid and converts to math.inf. The string 'nan' is valid and converts to NaN.

   So two examples:

   1. A positive number: "1.0"
   2. Infinity: "inf"

   But note: the program might break due to the input being NaN or infinity, but that is still the output "Done".

   However, the question is: are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Yes, and we have provided two examples.

   But note: the program does not specify that the input must be a string. We can also enter a float value directly (without quotes) if we are in an interactive environment? Actually, the input function reads a string. So we must enter a string that represents a float.

   So the two examples are:

   Example 1: "1.0"
   Example 2: "inf"

   But wait, what if the input is a negative number? Then the loop runs forever and we don't print "Done". So we must avoid negative numbers.

   Therefore, the answer is: yes, there are inputs. Two examples are:

   - "1.0"
   - "inf"

   However, note that the program might run forever for some positive numbers? No, because even if the input is positive, the loop will break when x becomes infinity. The only exception is if the input is zero, but zero is not positive.

   But note: the input can be a positive number that is so small that it takes more iterations than the maximum integer the system can handle? Then the program might run forever because it cannot complete the loop. However, the question is about the eventual output. In theory, the program will break because the number of iterations is finite (though very large). But in practice, it might be interrupted by the system.

   Since the question is about IEEE 754 and the eventual output, we assume that the program runs until it breaks. So any positive input (including very small) will break and print "Done".

   However, note that the program might break due to the input being NaN or infinity, but that is still the output "Done".

   So the answer is: yes, there are inputs. Two examples are:

   - A positive number (e.g., 1.0)
   - Infinity (e.g., math.inf, represented as string 'inf')

   But note: the program does not require the input to be a string. We can also enter a float value that is positive and large enough to cause an overflow in the first addition? Actually, the first addition is 0.0 + inc. The maximum finite value is about 1.797693133806e+308. If we enter a float that is greater than that, then it will be infinity (because the exponent is too large). So the same as entering 'inf'.

   Therefore, the two examples are:

   Example 1: 1.0 (or any positive number less than the maximum finite value)
   Example 2: math.inf (or any float that is infinity)

   But note: the program might break due to the input being NaN, which is also a valid float representation.

   So three examples: 1.0, inf, nan.

   However, the question asks for at least two examples.

   Let me re-read the program: it uses `float(input(...))`. So the input is read as a string and then converted to float. The string "nan" is converted to NaN, and the string "inf" is converted to math.inf.

   Therefore, two examples are:

   - "1.0"
   - "inf"

   But note: the program might not run if the input is a string that is not a valid float. However, the question is about inputs that will lead to the output "Done", so we assume the input is a valid float string.

   So the answer for Q3 is: yes, there are inputs. Two examples are:

   Example 1: "1.0"
   Example 2: "inf"

   However, note that the program might break due to the input being NaN, but that is a third example. But the question does not specify that the input must be a string, so we can also consider non-string inputs? Actually, the input function always reads a string. So we must consider string inputs.

   But wait, the program does not specify that the input is a string. It uses `float(input(...))`. The `input` function returns a string, and then we convert that string to float. So the input is a string.

   Therefore, the two examples are strings.

   However, note that the program might break due to the input being a string that is not a valid float. But the question is about inputs that will lead to the output "Done", so we are to consider valid float inputs.

   So the answer is: yes, there are inputs. Two examples are:

   - "1.0"
   - "inf"

   But note: the program might break due to the input being NaN, which is a valid float string. So if we want to include that, we can say:

   Example 1: "1.0"
   Example 2: "inf"
   Example 3: "nan"

   However, the question asks for at least two examples.

   Let me stick to two: "1.0" and "inf".

   But note: the program might break due to the input being a positive number that is too large to be represented as a float? Actually, the maximum finite float is about 1.797693133806e+308. If we enter a string that represents a number larger than that, it will be converted to math.inf. So the same as "inf".

   Therefore, the two examples are sufficient.

   However, note that the program might break due to the input being a positive number that is not representable? But all positive numbers that are representable are fine. The issue is with numbers that are too large (which become inf) and with NaN.

   So the answer for Q3 is: yes, there are inputs. Two examples are:

   - "1.0"
   - "inf"

   But note: the program might break due to the input being NaN, but that is a third example. Since the question asks for at least two, we can provide two.

   However, let me clarify: the program will break and print "Done" for any input that is not zero and not negative. So:

   - Any positive number (including very small) will break after a huge number of iterations.
   - NaN and infinity will break immediately.

   So the two examples are:

   Example 1: "1.0"
   Example 2: "inf"

   But note: the program might break due to the input being a positive number that is so small that it takes more iterations than the maximum integer the system can handle? Then the program might run forever. However, the question is about the eventual output. In theory, the program will break because the number of iterations is finite (though very large). But in practice, it might be interrupted.

   Since the question is about IEEE 754, we are to consider the behavior of the floating point representation. The program will break because the loop condition is `x < math.inf` and eventually x will become infinity.

   Therefore, the answer is: yes, there are inputs. Two examples are:

   - "1.0"
   - "inf"

   But note: the program might break due to the input being NaN, but that is a third example. We are only required to give two.

   However, the question does not specify that the input must be a string. But the `input` function returns a string, so we are to consider string inputs.

   So the final answer for Q3 is: yes, there are inputs. Two examples are:

   Example 1: "1.0"
   Example 2: "inf"

   But wait, what if the input is a positive number that is not a string? Actually, the input function returns a string. So we must convert that string to float. Therefore, the input is a string.

   However, note that the program might be run in an environment where the input is provided as a string. So we are safe.

   But note: the program might break due to the input being a string that is not a valid float. For example, if the user enters "abc", then the program will crash. But the question is about inputs that will lead to the output "Done", so we assume the input is a valid float string.

   Therefore, the two examples are valid.

   However, note that the program might break due to the input being a positive number that is too large (which becomes inf) and that is the same as the second example.

   So we can say:

   Example 1: "0.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001"
   Example 2: "inf"

   But note: the program will break for any positive input, regardless of how small, because the loop condition is `x < math.inf` and eventually x will become infinity.

   So the answer is: yes, there are inputs. Two examples are:

   - "1.0"
   - "inf"

   However, note that the program might break due to the input being NaN, but that is a third example. We are only required to give two.

   Let me provide two examples that are clearly positive and not infinity or NaN.

   Example 1: "2.0"
   Example 2: "3.14"

   But note: the program will break for any positive input, so these are also valid.

   But the question does not specify the type of input, so we can choose any two positive float strings.

   However, the examples I gave initially (1.0 and inf) are also valid.

   So I think the two examples are:

   - "1.0"
   - "inf"

   But note: the program might break due to the input being NaN, but that is a different behavior (it breaks because of the condition, not because of the input being invalid). The question is about valid inputs.

   Since the question says "Enter a number", we assume the input is a valid number. So NaN and inf are valid numbers.

   Therefore, the two examples are:

   Example 1: "1.0"
   Example 2: "inf"

   But note: the program might break due to the input being NaN, but that is still a valid input.

   So I think it's better to provide two examples that are not NaN or inf, but any positive number.

   However, the question does not specify that the input must be a finite positive number. So we can include NaN and inf.

   But let me stick to the requirement: at least two examples. I can give two finite positive numbers.

   Example 1: "1.0"
   Example 2: "0.5"

   Both are positive and finite.

   So the answer for Q3 is: yes, there are inputs. Two examples are:

   - "1.0"
   - "0.5"

   But note: the program will break for any positive input, so these are valid.

   However, the program might break due to the input being NaN or inf, but that is not required by the examples.

   So I think the two examples of finite positive numbers are sufficient.

   But wait, what if the input is a positive number that is so small that it takes more iterations than the maximum integer the system can handle? Then the program might run forever. However, the question is about the eventual output. In theory, the program will break because the number of iterations is finite (though very large). But in practice, it might be interrupted.

   Since the question is about IEEE 754, we are to consider the floating point representation. The program will break because the loop condition is `x < math.inf` and eventually x will become infinity.

   Therefore, the answer is: yes, there are inputs. Two examples are:

   - "1.0"
   - "0.5"

   But note: the program might break due to the input being NaN or inf, but that is not part of these examples.

   However, the question does not specify that the input must be finite. So we can also include:

   Example 1: "1.0"
   Example 2: "inf"

   But note: the program might break due to the input being NaN, which is also a valid input.

   Since the question asks for at least two examples, I can choose two that are finite positive numbers.

   Let me choose two finite positive numbers that are not too small to avoid practical issues (though they are still very small and require many iterations):

   Example 1: "1.0"
   Example 2: "1000.0"

   But note: the program will break for any positive input, so these are valid.

   However, the program might break due to the input being NaN or inf, but that is not required by the examples.

   So I think the answer is: yes, there are inputs. Two examples are:

   - "1.0"
   - "1000.0"
