To perform a binary search on a file directly, we need to read the file in chunks and compare the middle chunk with the target. This approach allows us to perform the search in O(log(n)) operations, where n is the number of lines in the file.

Here's a Python function that performs a binary search on a file:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    def read_chunk(file, start, length):
        file.seek(start)
        return file.read(length)

    def compare_chunks(chunk1, chunk2):
        return chunk1.decode().splitlines()[0] < chunk2.decode().splitlines()[0]

    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        file_size = file.seek(0, 2)
        file.seek(0, 0)

        left, right = 0, file_size

        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            chunk_size = min(4096, mid - left + 1)  # Read a chunk of at most 4096 bytes

            chunk = read_chunk(file, left, chunk_size)
            if compare_chunks(chunk, target):
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid

        # Check if the target is at the left boundary
        if left == file_size:
            return file_size

        # Read the chunk at the left boundary and compare with the target
        chunk = read_chunk(file, left, 4096)
        if compare_chunks(chunk, target):
            return left + len(chunk.decode().splitlines()[0].encode())
        else:
            return left

# Example usage:
print(binary_search_file("myfile.txt", b"2 by"))
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading the File:**
   - We open the file in binary mode (`'rb'`) to read it as bytes.
   - We get the file size and seek to the beginning of the file.

2. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - We maintain a binary search loop with `left` and `right` pointers.
   - We calculate the middle point `mid` and read a chunk of bytes from the file starting at `left` and of size `chunk_size`.
   - We compare the chunk with the target using the `compare_chunks` function.

3. **Chunk Comparison:**
   - The `compare_chunks` function decodes the chunks, splits them into lines, and compares the first line of each chunk.
   - This ensures that we are comparing the lines lexicographically.

4. **Finding the Insertion Point:**
   - After the binary search loop, we check if the target is at the left boundary.
   - If the target is not found, we read the chunk at the left boundary and compare it with the target to find the exact position.

5. **Returning the Position:**
   - The function returns the position of the target or the insertion point.

### Example Usage:
The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with a file path and a target byte string. The function returns the byte position of the target or the insertion point.

This approach ensures that the binary search is performed in O(log(n)) operations, where n is the number of lines in the file. The actual number of operations depends on the size of the file and the chunk size used for reading. [end of text]
