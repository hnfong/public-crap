Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

No, there is no input that will lead to the output "Done". The reason is that the condition `x < math.inf` will always be true because `math.inf` represents positive infinity. The value of `x` will never be equal to or greater than positive infinity, so the loop will run indefinitely without reaching a termination condition. 

Therefore, the program will run forever (or until the program is manually terminated) without printing "Done". 

Note that it's possible to modify the code to avoid an infinite loop. For example, one could replace the condition `x < math.inf` with a condition like `x < 10000` or `x < 10**10`, depending on the expected range of values for `x`. Alternatively, one could add a counter that limits the number of iterations of the loop, or add a keyboard interrupt signal to allow the user to terminate the program manually. 

Examples of inputs that would result in an infinite loop (i.e. would not lead to the output "Done") include any positive number, as well as any negative number with an absolute value smaller than the initial value of `x` (i.e. 0.0). For instance, if the user enters 1.0 as the input, the loop will continue to increment `x` by 1.0 indefinitely, never reaching a termination condition. Similarly, if the user enters -0.5 as the input, the loop will continue to increment `x` by -0.5 indefinitely, never reaching a termination condition.
