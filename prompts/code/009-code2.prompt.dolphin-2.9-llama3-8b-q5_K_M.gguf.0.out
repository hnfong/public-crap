Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a file directly, we can use the bisect module in Python, which provides support for maintaining a list in sorted order without having to sort the list after each insertion.

First, we need to read the file and load its contents into memory. We can do this by opening the file and reading its lines into a list:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
```

Next, we can use the bisect_left function from the bisect module to perform the binary search:

```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    pos = bisect.bisect_left(lines, target)
    return pos
```

The bisect_left function returns the insertion point for the target in the sorted list, or the position where the target would be inserted if it were not already in the list. This is equivalent to performing a binary search on the list.

Here's the complete function:

```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    pos = bisect.bisect_left(lines, target)
    return pos
```

This function will return the position of the target in the file, or the insertion point if the target is not found. The time complexity of this operation is O(log n), as requested.<|im_end|>
