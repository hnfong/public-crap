You're right, directly performing binary search on a file line by line would be inefficient.  

Here's why and how to achieve the desired O(log(n)) complexity:

**Why Direct Line-by-Line Binary Search Doesn't Work Well**

* **Sequential Access:**  Files are typically accessed sequentially. Reading a line, then jumping back to a different line for comparison would involve a lot of disk seeks, making it extremely slow.

**The Solution: In-Memory Sorting**

The key is to bring a portion of the file into memory and sort it.  Here's a breakdown of how to do this efficiently:

1. **Read in Chunks:** Read the file in chunks of a reasonable size (e.g., 1024 lines).

2. **Sort Each Chunk:** Sort each chunk in memory using a fast sorting algorithm like Timsort (Python's built-in `sorted()` function uses Timsort).

3. **Merge Sorted Chunks:**  Merge the sorted chunks together to create a single sorted in-memory representation of the file.

4. **Binary Search:** Now that you have a sorted in-memory data structure, you can perform a standard binary search on it.

**Python Implementation**

```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    """
    Performs a binary search on a sorted text file.

    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the sorted text file.
        target (str): The name to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The index of the target name in the file, or the insertion point.
    """

    data = []
    chunk_size = 1024  # Adjust as needed

    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        while True:
            chunk = [line.strip() for line in f.readlines(chunk_size)]
            if not chunk:
                break  # End of file

            chunk.sort()  # Sort each chunk in memory
            data.extend(chunk)

    return bisect.bisect_left(data, target)  # Binary search using bisect_left

# Example usage
file_path = 'names.txt'
target_name = 'Alice'
position = binary_search_file(file_path, target_name)
print(f"Target '{target_name}' found at position: {position}")
```

**Explanation:**

* **`bisect_left`:** The `bisect_left` function from Python's `bisect` module efficiently performs a binary search and returns the index where the `target` should be inserted to maintain sorted order.

* **Chunk Size:** The `chunk_size` variable controls how much data is read into memory at a time. Experiment with different values to find the optimal balance between memory usage and performance.

* **Memory Management:** Be mindful of memory usage, especially for very large files. You might consider using techniques like memory mapping or streaming algorithms if memory becomes a constraint.
