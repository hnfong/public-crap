## Binary Search on a Sorted Text File

While binary search traditionally works on sorted arrays in memory, we can adapt it to work on a sorted text file by leveraging the file's sequential nature. 

Here's how:

1. **Seek to the Middle:** Open the file and calculate the middle position. Use the `seek()` method to jump to this position.

2. **Read a Chunk:** Read a chunk of text from the file starting at the middle position. The size of this chunk should be large enough to potentially contain the target, but not so large as to be inefficient.

3. **Search the Chunk:** Perform a linear search within the read chunk to find the target.

4. **Adjust Search Range:**
   - If the target is found, return its byte position.
   - If the target is smaller than the first line in the chunk, adjust the search range to the first half of the file and repeat steps 1-4.
   - If the target is larger than the last line in the chunk, adjust the search range to the second half of the file and repeat steps 1-4.

5. **Repeat:** Continue this process of halving the search range until the target is found or the search range becomes empty.

**Python Implementation:**

```python
import os

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    """
    Performs a binary search on a sorted text file.

    Args:
        file_path (str): Path to the sorted text file.
        target (bytes): The target bytes to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The byte position of the target, or the insertion point.
    """
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        file_size = os.fstat(f.fileno()).st_size
        left = 0
        right = file_size

        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            f.seek(mid)
            chunk_size = 1024  # Adjust chunk size as needed
            chunk = f.read(chunk_size)

            # Linear search within the chunk
            if target in chunk:
                return f.tell()  # Return the current position

            # Adjust search range
            if target < chunk.split(b'\n')[0]:
                right = mid
            else:
                left = mid + chunk_size

    return left  # Insertion point


# Example usage
file_path = "myfile.txt"
target = b"2 by"
position = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
print(f"Target found at byte position: {position}")
```

**Note:**

- This implementation uses a fixed chunk size. You can adjust this based on the file size and expected target length.
- The linear search within the chunk can be optimized further using techniques like Rabin-Karp or Boyer-Moore if performance is critical.
- This approach assumes the file is truly sorted lexicographically.
