Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

Performing a binary search directly on a text file can be a bit tricky because files are not inherently random access structures like arrays or lists. However, we can still achieve this by leveraging the file's ability to seek to specific positions and read from there. The key is to use the file's `seek` method to jump to the middle of the file and read lines around that position to determine which half of the file to search next.

Here's a step-by-step approach to perform a binary search on a text file:

1. **Determine the File Size**: First, determine the size of the file in bytes.
2. **Binary Search Logic**: Use binary search logic to narrow down the search range. At each step, calculate the middle position in bytes, seek to that position, and read the line starting from there.
3. **Adjust Search Range**: Compare the target with the line read from the file. If the target is less than the line, adjust the search range to the left half. If the target is greater, adjust the search range to the right half.
4. **Handle Edge Cases**: Ensure that the search handles cases where the target is not found, returning the insertion point.

Here's the Python function implementing this logic:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    def read_line_at_position(file, position):
        file.seek(position)
        # Move to the start of the line if we are not at the start of the file
        if position != 0:
            file.readline()  # Skip the partial line
        return file.readline().strip()

    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        low, high = 0, file.seek(0, 2)  # high is the size of the file in bytes

        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            mid_line = read_line_at_position(file, mid)

            if mid_line < target:
                low = file.tell()  # Move low to the start of the next line
            elif mid_line > target:
                high = mid  # Move high to the current position
            else:
                return mid_line  # Target found

        # If we exit the loop, low is the insertion point
        return low

# Example usage:
# position = binary_search_file('names.txt', 'John')
# print(position)
```

### Explanation:
- **`read_line_at_position` Function**: This helper function seeks to a given position in the file and reads the line starting from that position. If the position is not at the start of a line, it reads and discards the partial line to ensure it starts reading from the beginning of a line.
- **Binary Search Loop**: The main loop performs the binary search. It calculates the middle position, reads the line at that position, and adjusts the search range based on the comparison with the target.
- **Insertion Point**: If the target is not found, the loop exits with `low` being the position where the target should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

This approach ensures that the search is performed in O(log(n)) operations, where n is the number of lines in the file. [end of text]
