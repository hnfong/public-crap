Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Q1. The eventual output of the given Python program will be `inf`. 

Here's why: In IEEE 754 floating-point representation, there is a maximum value that can be represented, which is approximately 1.7976931348623157e+308. When `x` reaches this value, adding 1.0 to it will result in `inf` (infinity), because the result cannot be represented exactly in the floating-point format. Therefore, the loop will terminate, and `inf` will be printed.

Q2. The eventual output of the given Python program will also be `inf`. 

Here's why: Similar to the previous case, when `x` grows exponentially, it will eventually exceed the maximum value that can be represented in the IEEE 754 floating-point format. At that point, the result of the multiplication will be `inf`, and the loop will terminate, printing `inf`.

Q3. Yes, there are inputs that will lead to the output "Done". 

Here are two examples of such inputs:

1. `inc = 0.0`: In this case, the loop will run indefinitely, but since `x` will never change, it will never reach `inf`, and the program will not terminate. However, if you manually stop the program, you will see the output "Done".

2. `inc = -1.0`: In this case, `x` will decrease by 1.0 in each iteration, and since it starts at 0.0, it will never reach `inf`. The loop will run indefinitely, but again, if you manually stop the program, you will see the output "Done".

Note that these examples are a bit contrived, as they rely on the program being manually stopped or running indefinitely. In general, it's not recommended to write programs that rely on manual intervention or infinite loops. [end of text]
