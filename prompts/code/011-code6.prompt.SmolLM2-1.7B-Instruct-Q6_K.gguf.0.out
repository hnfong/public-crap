Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Yes, there are inputs that can lead to the output "Done". Here are two examples:

1. Inputting a very large number:

```
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

In this case, the input number is very large, and the loop will continue to increment `x` until it reaches infinity.

2. Inputting a negative number:

```
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

In this case, the input number is negative, and the loop will continue to increment `x` until it reaches infinity.

However, it's worth noting that the program will not actually reach infinity, because the `float(input("Enter a number"))` will always return a finite number. But the loop will continue to increment `x` until it reaches a value that is greater than the input number, which is infinity.

To avoid this issue, you could add a condition to check if the input number is infinity before entering the loop:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
if math.isinf(inc):
    print("Infinity is not a valid input")
else:
    while x < math.inf:
        x += inc
    print("Done")
