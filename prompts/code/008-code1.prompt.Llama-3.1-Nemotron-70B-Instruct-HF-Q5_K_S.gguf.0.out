Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

**Bubble Sort Implementation**
================================

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """
    Sorts an array in ascending order using Bubble Sort.

    Args:
        arr (list): The input list to be sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted list.
    """
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n-1):
        # Create a flag that will allow the function to terminate early if there's nothing left to sort
        swapped = False
        for j in range(n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                # Swap values
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
                swapped = True
        # If no two elements were swapped in the inner loop, the list is sorted
        if not swapped:
            break
    return arr

# Example usage:
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
print("Original array:", arr)
print("Sorted array:", bubble_sort(arr))
```

**Merge Sort Implementation**
==========================

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    """
    Sorts an array in ascending order using Merge Sort.

    Args:
        arr (list): The input list to be sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted list.
    """
    # Base case: If the array has 1 or fewer elements, it's already sorted
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr

    # Split the array into two halves
    mid = len(arr) // 2
    left_half = arr[:mid]
    right_half = arr[mid:]

    # Recursively sort both halves
    left_half = merge_sort(left_half)
    right_half = merge_sort(right_half)

    # Merge the sorted halves
    return merge(left_half, right_half)


def merge(left, right):
    """
    Merges two sorted lists into a single sorted list.

    Args:
        left (list): The first sorted list.
        right (list): The second sorted list.

    Returns:
        list: The merged sorted list.
    """
    merged = []
    left_index = right_index = 0

    # Merge smaller elements first
    while left_index < len(left) and right_index < len(right):
        if left[left_index] <= right[right_index]:
            merged.append(left[left_index])
            left_index += 1
        else:
            merged.append(right[right_index])
            right_index += 1

    # If there are remaining elements in either half, append them
    merged.extend(left[left_index:])
    merged.extend(right[right_index:])

    return merged

# Example usage:
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
print("Original array:", arr)
print("Sorted array:", merge_sort(arr))
```

**Algorithm Discussion and Comparison**
=====================================

### **Bubble Sort**

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   **Best-case:** O(n) - When the input list is already sorted.
    *   **Average-case:** O(n^2)
    *   **Worst-case:** O(n^2) - When the input list is reverse sorted.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1) - Only a single additional memory space is required for the temporary swap.
*   **Stability:** Stable - Maintains the relative order of equal elements.
*   **Use Cases:** Bubble sort is not suitable for large data sets due to its high time complexity. However, it can be useful for:
    *   Small data sets or nearly sorted lists (due to its best-case O(n) performance).
    *   Limited resources (e.g., embedded systems) where simplicity and low overhead are crucial.

### **Merge Sort**

*   **Time Complexity:**
    *   **Best-case:** O(n log n)
    *   **Average-case:** O(n log n)
    *   **Worst-case:** O(n log n)
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n) - Requires additional space for the merged array.
*   **Stability:** Stable - Preserves the relative order of equal elements.
*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Large data sets - Merge sort's efficient time complexity makes it suitable for big data.
    *   External sorting - Its ability to handle partial sorting and merging makes it ideal for sorting data that doesn't fit into memory.
    *   Multi-threaded or distributed environments - Merge sort can be easily parallelized, taking advantage of multiple CPU cores or nodes.

**Comparison Summary:**

| **Criteria** | **Bubble Sort** | **Merge Sort** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Time Complexity** | O(n^2) (avg/worst), O(n) (best) | O(n log n) (all cases) |
| **Space Complexity** | O(1) | O(n) |
| **Stability** | Stable | Stable |
| **Suitable For** | Small/nearly sorted data, limited resources | Large data sets, external sorting, parallel environments |

**Choose:**

*   **Bubble Sort** for extremely small or nearly sorted datasets where simplicity is key.
*   **Merge Sort** for general-purpose sorting, especially with large datasets or when stability and efficiency are crucial. [end of text]
