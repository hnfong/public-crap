To perform a binary search on a file directly, we can use the `seek()` method to move the file pointer to a specific position in the file. We can then read a line from the file and compare it to the target value. If the target value is less than the current line, we move the file pointer to the middle of the current range and repeat the process. If the target value is greater than the current line, we move the file pointer to the middle of the current range and repeat the process. We continue this process until we find the target value or reach the end of the file.

Here's a Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        start = 0
        end = f.seek(0, 2)  # move to the end of the file
        while start <= end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            f.seek(mid)
            # skip to the next line if we're in the middle of a line
            if mid != 0 and f.read(1) != b'\n':
                f.readline()
            line = f.readline()
            if line == b'':
                return end  # target is greater than all lines in the file
            if line < target:
                start = f.tell()
            else:
                end = f.tell() - len(line)
                if line == target:
                    return end
        return start  # target is not in the file, return the insertion point
```

This function takes a file path and a target value as input, and returns the byte position of the target value in the file, or the insertion point if the target value is not in the file. The function uses the `seek()` method to move the file pointer to the middle of the current range, and then reads a line from the file using the `readline()` method. If the current line is less than the target value, the function updates the start of the range to the current position. If the current line is greater than or equal to the target value, the function updates the end of the range to the current position minus the length of the current line. If the current line is equal to the target value, the function returns the current position minus the length of the current line. If the function reaches the end of the file without finding the target value, it returns the end of the file as the insertion point.

The time complexity of this function is O(log(n)), where n is the number of lines in the file. This is because the function performs a binary search on the file, which has a time complexity of O(log(n)). The space complexity of this function is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of extra space to store the start and end positions of the current range. [end of text]
