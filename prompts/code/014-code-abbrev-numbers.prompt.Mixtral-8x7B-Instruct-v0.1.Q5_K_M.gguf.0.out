Here's a coding task. Please read the requirements carefully as it may contain some nuance.

You are required to write a function that takes in an integer. The output should be a string that roughly represents the number in compact, human readable form. for example, input/output pairs may be:

- 2 => 2
- 800 => 0.8k
- 9385832 => 9.4M

The idea is to represent the number with a couple significant digits and give the order of magnitude. The output string should be less than 4 characters if at all possible.

You may use any popular and reasonable programming language. Make sure to handle all edge cases you can think of.
 [/INST] Here is a Python function that meets the requirements:
```
def compact_number_string(n: int) -> str:
    if n < 0:
        return '-' + compact\_number\_string(-n)

    if n < 1000:
        return str(n)

    if n < 10_000:
        return f"{n / 1000:.1f}k"

    if n < 100_000_000:
        return f"{n / 1000_000:.1f}M"

    if n < 10_000_000_000:
        return f"{n / 1000_000_000:.1f}B"

    return f"{n / 1000_000_000_000:.1f}T"
```
This function first checks if the input number is negative, and if so, it returns the negative of the absolute value of the number.

If the input number is less than 1000, it simply returns the number as a string.

If the input number is between 1000 and 10,000, it returns the number divided by 1000 and formatted with 1 decimal place, followed by the letter "k".

If the input number is between 10,000 and 100,000,000, it returns the number divided by 1,000,000 and formatted with 1 decimal place, followed by the letter "M".

If the input number is between 100,000,000 and 10,000,000,000, it returns the number divided by 1,000,000,000 and formatted with 1 decimal place, followed by the letter "B".

If the input number is 10,000,000,000 or greater, it returns the number divided by 1,000,000,000,000 and formatted with 1 decimal place, followed by the letter "T".

This function handles edge cases such as negative input, and it uses a series of if statements to handle different ranges of input values. It also uses the `f` string syntax to format the output string with the correct number of decimal places and the correct order of magnitude label. [end of text]
