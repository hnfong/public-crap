Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Remember to answer all the questions

Q1.

I'll answer all three questions.

**Q1.**

In IEEE 754 floating-point representation, the maximum value that can be represented is `inf` (infinity). When you add a finite value to `inf`, the result is still `inf`. Therefore, the program will run indefinitely, and the value of `x` will never change.

The eventual output of the program is `inf`.

**Q2.**

In IEEE 754 floating-point representation, the maximum value that can be represented is `inf`. When you multiply a finite value by a small positive value (in this case, `1.001`), the result is still `inf`. Therefore, the program will run indefinitely, and the value of `x` will never change.

The eventual output of the program is `inf`.

**Q3.**

The program will run indefinitely if the input `inc` is a small positive value. This is because the loop condition `x < math.inf` will always be true, and the value of `x` will never change.

Here are two examples of inputs that will lead to the output "Done":

1. `inc = 1.0`: In this case, the loop will run indefinitely, and the value of `x` will never change. Therefore, the program will print "Done" immediately.
2. `inc = 1e-323`: In this case, the loop will run for a very long time, but it will eventually terminate because the value of `x` will exceed `math.inf`. The program will print "Done" after a very long time.

Note that the value of `inc` should be very small, but not exactly zero, to ensure that the loop runs indefinitely. If `inc` is exactly zero, the loop will terminate immediately. [end of text]
