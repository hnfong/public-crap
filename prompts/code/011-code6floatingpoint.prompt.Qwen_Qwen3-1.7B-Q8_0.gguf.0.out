Let's analyze each question assuming IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic.

---

### **Q1.**

```python
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

**Answer:**

This loop will **never terminate** because `math.inf` is not a finite value in IEEE 754. The condition `x < math.inf` is always true for finite `x`, so the loop will run indefinitely.

**Output:** The program will **infinite loop** and never print anything.

---

### **Q2.**

```python
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

**Answer:**

This loop will also **never terminate** for the same reason as Q1. The condition `x < math.inf` is always true for finite `x`, so the loop will run indefinitely.

**Output:** The program will **infinite loop** and never print anything.

### **Q3.**

```python
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

**Answer:**

This program will **terminate** if the input `inc` is **zero** or **negative**.

#### **Examples:**

1. **Input: `inc = 0.0`**  
   - `x += inc` does nothing, so the loop never runs.  
   - Output: `"Done"`

2. **Input: `inc = -1.0`**  
   - `x` decreases by 1.0 each iteration.  
   - Eventually, `x` will reach `math.inf` (but not before).  
   - Output: `"Done"`

**Note:** The loop will terminate **only if the increment is zero or negative**, because the loop condition `x < math.inf` will eventually become false.

---

### **Summary:**

- **Q1:** Infinite loop, program does not terminate.
- **Q2:** Infinite loop, program does not terminate.
- **Q3:** Termination occurs if `inc` is zero or negative. [end of text]
