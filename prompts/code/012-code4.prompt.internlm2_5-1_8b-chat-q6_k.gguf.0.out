What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)

assistant
The program will print the value of `x` after it has been incremented by 1.0 in each iteration of the while loop until `x` becomes greater than or equal to the maximum value that can be represented by a float in Python, which is `float('inf')`. 

In this case, the maximum value that can be represented by a float in Python is `float('inf')`, which is approximately 1.7976931348623157e+308. 

Therefore, the program will print the value of `x` after it has been incremented by 1.0 in each iteration of the while loop until `x` becomes greater than or equal to `float('inf')`. [end of text]
