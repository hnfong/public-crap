Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Yes, there are two examples of inputs that will lead to the output "Done".

The first example is:

```
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < 0:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

In this case, the program will keep asking for a number until it reaches 0, which is a valid input.

The second example is:

```
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < 0:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

In this case, the program will keep asking for a number until it reaches 0, which is not a valid input. The `input()` function in Python returns a string, so the program will not be able to handle the case where the user enters a negative number.

However, if you want to handle the case where the user enters a negative number, you can use a try-except block to catch the `ValueError` exception that is raised when the user enters a negative number:

```
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < 0:
    x += inc
    print("Done")
```

This will catch the `ValueError` exception and print an error message instead of crashing the program. [end of text]
