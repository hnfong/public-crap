Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.
The program you provided will not print "Done" for any input, regardless of the value of `inc`. Let's break down why this is the case:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `x` is initialized to `0.0`.
2. **Input**: The variable `inc` is set to the value entered by the user, which is a floating-point number.
3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `x < math.inf`.

The key point here is that `math.inf` represents infinity, which is a special value in Python that is greater than any other number. Therefore, the condition `x < math.inf` will always be true, no matter how large `x` becomes.

### Analysis:
- **Case 1**: If `inc` is a positive number, `x` will keep increasing with each iteration. Since `x` will never reach or exceed `math.inf`, the loop will never terminate.
- **Case 2**: If `inc` is a negative number or zero, `x` will either not change (if `inc` is zero) or decrease (if `inc` is negative). In either case, `x` will never reach `math.inf`, so the loop will continue indefinitely.

### Conclusion:
There is no input value for `inc` that will cause the loop to terminate and print "Done". The loop will run indefinitely because `x` will never reach `math.inf`. Therefore, the program will never print "Done". [end of text]
