Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

assistant
```python
from bisect import bisect_left
import os

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    """
    Performs a binary search on a text file containing names sorted in lexicographical order
    and returns the position of the target or the insertion point.
    
    :param file_path: Path to the text file
    :param target: The name to search for
    :return: The position of the target or the insertion point
    """
    
    file_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Define a function to retrieve lines from the current position in the file
        def line_reader(pos, n):
            file.seek(pos)
            return [next(file) for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Initial bounds of the search
        low = 0
        high = file_size
        
        # Determine the average line length to estimate positions
        sample_lines = line_reader(0, 100)
        avg_line_len = sum(len(line) for line in sample_lines) / len(sample_lines)
        
        # Perform binary search
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            mid_pos = low + int((high - low) * (mid / file_size))
            mid_line = line_reader(mid_pos, 1)[0].strip()
            
            if mid_line == target:
                return mid
            elif mid_line < target:
                low = mid_pos + len(mid_line)
            else:
                high = mid_pos
        
        return low // avg_line_len

# Test the function
file_path = 'names.txt'  # Assume names.txt is a text file with one name per line sorted lexicographically
target = 'Smith'
position = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
print(f"Target found at position: {position}")
```

Note: This solution assumes that the file contains one name per line and is sorted in lexicographical order. The position returned is an estimation based on the average line length in the file and may not match the exact line number due to variable line lengths. Adjustments may be needed based on the specific file format and requirements. Also, the returned position is not a line number but a byte position in the file which could then be used to find the line number if needed.
