What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The program will enter an infinite loop and never terminate. The variable `x` is being multiplied by `1.001` in each iteration, so it will never reach `math.inf` and the loop will continue indefinitely.
<|im_end|>
