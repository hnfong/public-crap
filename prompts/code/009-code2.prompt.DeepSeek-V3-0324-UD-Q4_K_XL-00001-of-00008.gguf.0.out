To perform a binary search on a text file directly, we need to efficiently navigate through the file without loading the entire file into memory. The key idea is to use file seeking and reading operations to simulate the binary search process on the lines of the file.

### Approach
1. **Initial Setup**: Open the file in binary mode to handle byte positions accurately.
2. **Binary Search**: 
   - **Low and High Pointers**: Start with `low` at the beginning of the file (0) and `high` at the end of the file (file size).
   - **Mid Calculation**: For each iteration, calculate the mid position between `low` and `high`. 
   - **Reading Line at Mid**: Move to the mid position and read a line from there. Since mid might not be at the start of a line, we need to read until the next newline to get a complete line.
   - **Comparison**: Compare the read line with the target. Adjust `low` or `high` based on the comparison, similar to standard binary search.
3. **Termination**: The loop terminates when `low` exceeds `high`. The position where `low` ends up is the insertion point or the position of the target if found.

### Solution Code
```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        low = 0
        file.seek(0, 2)  # Move to the end to get the file size
        high = file.tell() - 1  # high is the last byte position
        
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            file.seek(mid)
            # Move to the beginning of the current line (after the next newline)
            # Unless mid is 0, then it's the start of the file
            if mid != 0:
                file.readline()  # This moves to the start of the next line
            line_start = file.tell()
            line = file.readline()
            if not line:
                # Handle case where mid is at or beyond the last line
                break
            current_line = line.strip()
            # Compare the current line with the target
            if current_line < target:
                low = file.tell()  # Move low to after this line
            elif current_line > target:
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                return line_start  # Found the target, return its start position
        return low
```

### Explanation
1. **File Handling**: The file is opened in binary mode to ensure accurate byte positioning.
2. **Binary Search Setup**: The initial `low` is set to the start of the file (0), and `high` is set to the last byte position in the file.
3. **Mid Calculation**: For each iteration, the mid position is calculated. The file pointer is moved to this position.
4. **Line Reading**: Since the mid position might not be at the start of a line, the code reads from mid to the next newline to ensure a complete line is read. The actual line starts at the position after the newline following mid.
5. **Comparison**: The read line is compared with the target. If the line is lexicographically smaller than the target, the search continues in the upper half; otherwise, it continues in the lower half.
6. **Termination**: The loop exits when `low` exceeds `high`. The value of `low` at this point indicates the insertion position or the position of the target if found.

This approach efficiently narrows down the search space by half in each iteration, adhering to the O(log n) time complexity requirement. The solution handles large files without loading them entirely into memory, making it memory efficient. [end of text]
