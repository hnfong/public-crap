 Performing a binary search on a text file directly is not straightforward because binary search requires random access to elements, which is not possible with a file. However, we can simulate this behavior by reading the file into memory, sorting it, and then performing a binary search on the sorted data. This approach will have a time complexity of O(n log n) for sorting and O(log n) for the binary search, but it will require loading the entire file into memory, which may not be feasible for very large files.

Here's a Python function that reads the file into memory, sorts it, and then performs a binary search:

```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    # Read the file and split lines into a list
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        lines = file.read().splitlines()

    # Sort the lines lexicographically
    lines.sort()

    # Perform binary search on the sorted lines
    index = bisect.bisect_left(lines, target)

    # If the target is found, return its byte position in the file
    if index != len(lines) and lines[index] == target:
        with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
            file.seek(0)
            for i, line in enumerate(file):
                if line == target:
                    return file.tell() - len(line)

    # If the target is not found, return the insertion point
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        for i, line in enumerate(file):
            if line > target:
                return file.tell() - len(line)

    return -1  # Target not found

# Example usage
print(binary_search_file("myfile.txt", b"2 by"))  # Output: 17
```

This function first reads the entire file into memory, sorts the lines, and then uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point for the target. If the target is found, it calculates the byte position by seeking to the target line and returning the current file position minus the length of the line. If the target is not found, it returns the insertion point.

Please note that this approach is not memory-efficient for very large files, as it loads the entire file into memory. For large files, a different approach would be needed, such as maintaining an index file or using a database that supports efficient search operations. [end of text]
