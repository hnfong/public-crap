Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Remember to answer all the questions

Q1.

assistant
The eventual output of the first Python program is `inf`. This is because the loop will continue to add `1.0` to `x` until `x` is no longer less than `math.inf`. Since `math.inf` represents positive infinity, `x` will eventually become `inf` after a large number of iterations.

Q2.
The eventual output of the second Python program is also `inf`. This is because the loop will continue to multiply `x` by `1.001` until `x` is no longer less than `math.inf`. Since `1.001` is greater than `1`, `x` will eventually become `inf` after a large number of iterations.

Q3.
Yes, there are inputs that will lead to the output "Done". For example, if the user enters `0.0` as the input, the loop will never execute and the program will immediately print "Done". Another example is if the user enters a negative number, such as `-1.0`. In this case, the loop will execute once, but `x` will become negative after the first iteration and will no longer be less than `math.inf`, so the loop will terminate and the program will print "Done".
