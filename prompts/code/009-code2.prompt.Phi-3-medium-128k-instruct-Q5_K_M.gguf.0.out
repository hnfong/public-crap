 Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").
 To perform a binary search on a text file directly, we can follow these steps:

1. Open the file and read its contents.
2. Split the contents into a list of lines.
3. Perform a binary search on the list of lines.
4. Return the position of the target or the insertion point.

Here's a Python function that implements the above steps:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    # Open the file and read its contents
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.read().splitlines()

    # Perform a binary search on the list of lines
    left, right = 0, len(lines) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        line = lines[mid]

        # Compare the target with the current line
        if line == target:
            return mid
        elif line < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    # If the target is not found, return the insertion point
    return left
```

This function reads the file and splits its contents into a list of lines. Then, it performs a binary search on the list of lines, comparing the target with the current line. If the target is found, the function returns the position of the target. If the target is not found, the function returns the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

The time complexity of this function is O(log(n)), where n is the number of lines in the file. This is because the binary search algorithm divides the search space in half at each step, resulting in a logarithmic time complexity.
