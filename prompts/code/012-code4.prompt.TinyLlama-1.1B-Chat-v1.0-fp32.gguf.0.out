What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
Output: 1
```

In this example, the program first calculates the value of x, which is 0.0. Then, it while loops until x reaches 1.0, which is the value of the expression `x += 1.0`. The `print(x)` statement prints the current value of x, which is 1.0. Once x reaches 1.0, the while loop ends, and the output is printed.</s>
