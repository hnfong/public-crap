Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Remember to answer all the questions

Q1.

assistant
The eventual output of the first program is an infinite loop. The variable `x` is set to 0.0, and in each iteration of the loop, it is incremented by 1.0. Since floating-point numbers cannot precisely represent all real numbers, `x` will never exactly reach `math.inf`, causing the loop to continue indefinitely.

Q2. The eventual output of the second program is also an infinite loop. Here, `x` starts at 1.0, and in each iteration, it is multiplied by 1.001. As multiplication by a number slightly greater than 1 accumulates error in the floating-point representation, `x` will keep increasing but never reach `math.inf`.

Q3. Yes, there are inputs that will lead to the output "Done". If the input `inc` is a non-positive number, the loop will not execute at all, and the program will immediately print "Done". Here are two examples of such inputs:

1. `inc = 0.0` - This will set the increment to zero, so `x` will remain at 0.0, and the loop condition will never be met, printing "Done" directly.
2. `inc = -1.0` - This will decrement `x` by 1.0 in each iteration. Since `x` starts at 0.0, it will become negative after the first iteration, causing the loop condition `x < math.inf` to be false, and the program will print "Done". [end of text]
