Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a text file directly, we can use the `bisect` module in Python, which provides support for maintaining a list in sorted order without having to sort the list after each insertion.

Here's a Python function that performs a binary search on a text file using the `bisect` module:
```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()

    # Convert lines to a list of strings
    names = [line.strip() for line in lines]

    # Perform binary search
    index = bisect.bisect_left(names, target)

    if index != len(names) and names[index] == target:
        return index
    else:
        return -1
```
This function reads the lines from the file into a list, converts the list to a list of strings, and then performs a binary search using the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module. The `bisect_left` function returns the insertion point for the target in the sorted list, which is the index where the target should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

The time complexity of this function is O(log(n)), where n is the number of lines in the file. This is because the binary search algorithm reduces the search space by half in each iteration, resulting in a logarithmic time complexity.

Note that this function assumes that the file is sorted in lexicographical order. If the file is not sorted, the function will not work correctly.

Also, this function returns the insertion point for the target, not the position of the target in the file. If you want to find the position of the target in the file, you can modify the function to return the index of the target in the list of lines, instead of the insertion point.

Here's an example usage of the function:
```python
file_path = 'names.txt'
target = 'John'
position = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
if position != -1:
    print(f'Found {target} at position {position}')
else:
    print(f'{target} not found in file')
```
This will search for the name 'John' in the file 'names.txt' and print the position of the name if it is found, or a message indicating that the name was not found. [end of text]
