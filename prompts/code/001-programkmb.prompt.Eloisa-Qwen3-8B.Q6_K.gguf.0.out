<think>
Okay, I need to write a Java program that reads a string from standard input, extracts numbers with optional suffixes (like k, K, m, M, g, G), converts them to their base values (kilo=1024, mega=1024^2, etc.), sums them up, and then displays the total sum along with the sum in kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes, each to one decimal place.

First, I should think about how to parse the input. The input can have multiple lines and numbers with commas as thousand separators. So, I need to split the input into tokens that represent numbers with possible suffixes.

I'll start by reading all the input lines and concatenating them into a single string. Then, I can use regular expressions to find all the number-suffix patterns.

The regular expression should match numbers that might have commas (as thousand separators) and then an optional suffix. The suffix can be lowercase or uppercase. So, the pattern could be something like:

- Match optional whitespace
- Match a number that can have commas (but not at the start)
- Match an optional suffix (k, K, m, M, g, G)
- Match optional whitespace

But I need to be careful with the commas. The number part should allow commas as thousand separators, but not as decimal points. So, the number part should be something like \d{1,3}(,\d{3})*, which matches numbers with commas separating groups of three digits.

Wait, but the number might also have a decimal point, like 1.5G. So, the number part should allow for optional decimal points. So, the regex for the number part could be:

- Optional sign (but the problem doesn't mention negative numbers, so maybe skip that)
- Optional decimal point with digits
- Or digits with optional commas
- Or a combination of digits, commas, and a decimal point

Actually, the input example has 1.5G, which is a decimal number with a suffix. So, the number part can have a decimal point. So, the regex for the number should be something like:

- Optional sign (but probably not needed)
- A sequence of digits, possibly with commas, and then an optional decimal point followed by more digits, or a decimal point followed by digits, or just digits with commas.

This might get complicated. Maybe I can split the input into tokens that are either numbers with commas or numbers with decimal points, and then check for suffixes.

Alternatively, I can use a regex that matches the entire pattern: a number (with optional commas and decimal point) followed by an optional suffix.

Let me think of a regex pattern that captures the number and the suffix. For example:

Pattern: ([-+]?\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*)(?:\.?\d+)?([kKmMgG])?

Wait, that might not be right. Let me break it down:

- [-+]? : optional sign
- \d{1,3} : 1 to 3 digits
- (?:,\d{3})* : zero or more commas followed by three digits
- (?:\.?\d+)? : optional decimal point and one or more digits
- ([kKmMgG])? : optional suffix

But this might not capture numbers like 1,234.56K correctly. Let me test this pattern.

Wait, the number part should be something like \d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})* which matches numbers with commas, and then optionally a decimal part. So, the full pattern could be:

Pattern: ([-+]?\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*\.?\d*)?([kKmMgG])?

But this might not handle the decimal part correctly. Maybe I should use a more flexible approach.

Another approach is to split the input into tokens based on non-numeric characters, but that might be error-prone.

Alternatively, I can use a regex that matches the entire number-suffix pattern. Let me try:

Pattern: ([-+]?\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*\.?\d*)([kKmMgG])?

But this might not capture the decimal part correctly. For example, 1.5G would be matched as 1.5 and G. But what about numbers like 1,234.56K? The regex would match 1,234.56 and K.

But the problem is that the number part can have commas and a decimal point. So, the regex should allow for commas as thousand separators and a decimal point for fractional parts.

So, the number part can be:

- Optional sign
- Optional part with digits and commas (but not at the start)
- Optional decimal point and digits

But how to structure this in regex?

Maybe:

Pattern: ([-+]?\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*)(?:\.?\d+)?([kKmMgG])?

Wait, this would match numbers like 1,234.56K as 1,234.56 and K. But the first part is \d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})* which matches 1,234, and then the optional decimal part is .56, so the entire number is 1,234.56.

But the problem is that the regex might not capture the decimal part correctly if there's no comma. For example, 1.5G would be matched as 1.5 and G.

But in Java, the regex engine might not handle this correctly because the decimal part is optional and might be confused with the comma part.

Alternatively, I can use a regex that matches the entire number, including commas and decimal points, and then check for the suffix.

Another idea: split the input into words, and for each word, check if it ends with a suffix (k, K, m, M, g, G). Then, extract the numeric part before the suffix.

But the numeric part can have commas and a decimal point. So, for each token, I can remove the suffix and parse the remaining string as a number, handling commas and decimal points.

This might be easier. So, the steps would be:

1. Read all input lines and concatenate into a single string.
2. Split the string into tokens (words) based on whitespace and punctuation.
3. For each token, check if it ends with one of the suffixes (k, K, m, M, g, G).
4. If it does, extract the numeric part (everything before the suffix) and parse it as a double, handling commas as thousand separators.
5. Convert the numeric value to the base value (kilo, mega, etc.) based on the suffix.
6. Sum all the converted values.

But how to split the input into tokens? The input can have multiple lines and various punctuation. Maybe I can split on any non-alphanumeric character except for commas and periods, but that might be messy.

Alternatively, I can use a regex to find all occurrences of numbers with optional suffixes. Let me try to create a regex that matches the entire pattern.

The pattern should match:

- Optional sign (but probably not needed)
- A number that can have commas as thousand separators and a decimal point
- Optional suffix (k, K, m, M, g, G)

So, the regex could be:

Pattern: ([-+]?\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*\.?\d*)([kKmMgG])?

But this might not capture the decimal part correctly. Let me test with some examples.

For "1.5G", the regex would match "1.5" and "G".

For "1,234.56K", it would match "1,234.56" and "K".

But what about "123456789"? That's a number without commas or suffix. The regex would match "123456789" and no suffix, but the problem says to extract numbers followed by optional suffixes. So, numbers without suffixes should be treated as base units (probably kilobytes? Or maybe the problem expects them to be treated as base units, but the example input doesn't have such cases. Wait, the example input has numbers with suffixes, but the problem says "numbers followed by optional suffixes", so numbers without suffixes should be treated as base units (probably kilobytes? Or maybe the base unit is bytes, and the suffixes are for kilo, mega, etc. Wait, the problem says "converts them to their base value (kilo=1024, M=1024*1024, etc.)", so the base value is the value without the suffix. So, if there's no suffix, the number is in base units (probably bytes? Or maybe the base unit is kilobytes? Wait, the example output shows the total sum in bytes, then in kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes. So, the base unit is bytes, and the suffixes are for kilo, mega, etc. So, a number without a suffix is in bytes.

Wait, the problem says: "extracts all numbers followed by optional suffixes (k, K, m, M, g, G), converts them to their base value (kilo=1024, M=1024*1024, etc.)"

So, the base value is the value without the suffix. For example, 1.5G is converted to 1.5 * 1024^3 bytes. If there's no suffix, the number is in bytes.

So, the regex should match numbers with optional suffixes. So, the pattern should be:

Pattern: ([-+]?\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*\.?\d*)([kKmMgG])?

But this would match numbers without suffixes as well, but in that case, the suffix part is empty. So, I can capture the entire number and then check if there's a suffix.

So, the regex can be:

Pattern: ([-+]?\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*\.?\d*)([kKmMgG])?

Then, for each match, the first group is the number string, and the second group is the suffix (or empty).

But the problem is that the number string might have commas and a decimal point. So, I need to parse that string into a double, handling commas as thousand separators.

So, the steps would be:

1. Read all input lines and concatenate into a single string.
2. Use a regex to find all matches of the pattern.
3. For each match:
   a. Extract the number string and the suffix.
   b. Parse the number string into a double, replacing commas with nothing.
   c. If there's a suffix, multiply the number by the corresponding factor (kilo=1024, mega=1024^2, etc.).
   d. Add the result to the total sum.
4. After processing all matches, calculate the total sum in bytes, then convert to kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes, each to one decimal place.
5. Print the results.

Now, the regex pattern. Let me define it properly.

The number part should allow for optional sign, but the problem doesn't mention negative numbers, so I can skip the sign. But to be safe, I can include it.

The number part can have commas as thousand separators and a decimal point. So, the regex for the number part is:

\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*\.?\d*

But this might not handle numbers like 123.456 correctly. Wait, the \d* at the end allows for optional digits after the decimal point. So, 123.456 would be matched as 123.456.

But what about numbers like 1,234.567? The regex would match 1,234.567.

But the problem is that the regex might not capture the decimal part correctly if there's no comma. For example, 1.5 would be matched as 1.5.

So, the regex for the number part is:

\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*\.?\d*

But this might not match numbers like 123456789 (without commas) because the regex requires at least one group of digits (1-3 digits) followed by optional commas and then digits. So, 123456789 would be matched as 123,456,789 if the regex is \d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*, but with the decimal part, it's \d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*\.?\d*.

Wait, the regex \d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})* matches numbers with commas, but for numbers without commas, it would match the first 1-3 digits, and then the rest would be part of the decimal part? No, because the decimal part is optional and comes after the comma part.

Actually, the regex \d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})* matches numbers with commas, but for numbers without commas, it would match the first 1-3 digits, and then the rest of the digits would be part of the decimal part if there's a decimal point. But that's not correct. For example, the number 123456789 would be matched as 123,456,789 if the regex is \d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*, but if there's no comma, it would match 123 and then the rest would be part of the decimal part if there's a decimal point. But in the case of 123456789, there's no decimal point, so the regex would match 123 and then the rest would be unmatched.

So, this regex is not suitable for numbers without commas. Therefore, I need a different approach.

Alternative approach: split the input into tokens, and for each token, check if it contains a suffix. Then, extract the numeric part and parse it.

So, the steps:

1. Read all input lines and concatenate into a single string.
2. Split the string into tokens based on whitespace and punctuation. But how to split? Maybe split on any non-alphanumeric character except for commas and periods, but that might be too broad.

Alternatively, use a regex to split on any non-digit, non-period, non-comma, non-sign character. But that might not be reliable.

Another idea: use a regex to find all occurrences of numbers with optional suffixes. The number can be:

- Optional sign
- Optional part with digits and commas (but not at the start)
- Optional decimal point and digits
- Optional suffix

But this is getting complicated.

Maybe I can use a regex that matches the entire pattern, including the number and suffix, and then parse the number part.

Let me try this regex:

Pattern: ([-+]?\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*\.?\d*)([kKmMgG])?

But as discussed, this might not handle numbers without commas correctly.

Wait, the problem says the input can contain multiple lines and numbers with commas as thousand separators. So, numbers without commas are also possible, like 123456789 or 123456.789.

So, the regex should handle both cases.

Maybe I can use a regex that matches numbers with or without commas and decimal points, and then check for the suffix.

Another approach: use a regex to match the entire pattern, and then parse the number part by replacing commas with nothing and then parsing as a double.

So, the regex can be:

Pattern: ([-+]?\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*\.?\d*)([kKmMgG])?

But this might not match numbers without commas. For example, 123456789 would be matched as 123,456,789 if the regex is \d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*, but if there's no comma, it would match 123 and then the rest would be part of the decimal part if there's a decimal point. But in the case of 123456789, there's no decimal point, so the regex would match 123 and then the rest would be unmatched.

So, this regex is not suitable for numbers without commas.

Alternative regex for the number part:

\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*|\d+\.?\d*

This would match either a number with commas or a number without commas (with optional decimal point).

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should split the input into tokens and then process each token.

Let me try this approach:

1. Read all input lines and concatenate into a single string.
2. Split the string into tokens using a regex that splits on any non-alphanumeric character except for commas and periods. But this might not be reliable.

Alternatively, use a regex to find all occurrences of numbers with optional suffixes. The number can be:

- Optional sign
- Optional part with digits and commas (but not at the start)
- Optional decimal point and digits
- Optional suffix

But I'm stuck on the regex.

Maybe I can use a regex that matches the entire pattern, including the number and suffix, and then parse the number part by replacing commas with nothing and then parsing as a double.

But in the case of 123456789, there's no decimal point, so the regex would match 123 and then the rest would be unmatched.

So, this regex is not suitable for numbers without commas.

Alternative regex for the number part:

\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*|\d+\.?\d*

This would match either a number with commas or a number without commas (with optional decimal point).

So, the full regex would be:

Pattern: ([-+]?(?:\d{1,3}(?:,\d{3})*|\d+\.?\d*))([kKmMgG])?

But this is getting too complex. Maybe I should use a different approach.

Let me think of the problem in terms of processing each token. I can split the input into tokens based on whitespace and punctuation, then for each token, check if it ends with a suffix. If it does, extract the numeric part and parse it.

So, the steps:

1. Read all input lines and concatenate into a single string.
2. Split the string into tokens using a regex that splits on any non-alphanumeric character except for commas and periods. But this might not be reliable.

Alternatively, use a regex to split on any character that is not a digit, period, or comma, but that would split on letters and other characters, which is not desired.

Another idea: use a regex to find all occurrences of numbers with optional suffixes. The number can be:

- Optional sign
- Optional part with digits and commas (but not at the start)
- Optional decimal point and digits
- Optional suffix

But I'm stuck on the regex.
