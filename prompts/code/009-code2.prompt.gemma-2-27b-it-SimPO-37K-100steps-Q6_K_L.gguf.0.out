Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

## Binary Search on a Sorted Text File

Performing binary search directly on a sorted text file leverages its ordered nature to efficiently locate a target name or determine its insertion point with **O(log n)** complexity, where 'n' is the number of names in the file.

**Algorithm:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Open the file in read mode (`'r'`).
   - Set `left` pointer to 0 (start of file) and `right` pointer to the estimated last line number (file size / average line length).

2. **Iteration:**
   - While `left <= right`:
     - Calculate `mid` index: `mid = (left + right) // 2`.
     - **Seek to line `mid`:** Use `file.seek(offset_of_line_mid)` to position the file pointer at the beginning of the `mid`-th line.
     - **Read and compare:** Read the line at `mid` and compare the name with the `target`.
       - **Match:** If equal, return `mid` (target found).
       - **Target precedes `mid` name:** Set `right = mid - 1`.
       - **Target follows `mid` name:** Set `left = mid + 1`.

3. **Insertion Point:** If the loop completes without a match, `left` points to the correct insertion position for the `target`. Return `left`.

**Python Implementation:**

```python
import os

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    """Performs binary search on a sorted text file for a target name.

    Args:
        file_path (str): Path to the sorted text file.
        target (str): Name to search for.

    Returns:
        int: Index (line number, 0-based) of the target if found, 
             otherwise the insertion point (bisect_left).
    """
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        file_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)
        avg_line_length = 20  # Estimate, adjust if needed
        right = file_size // avg_line_length - 1  # Approximate last line index
        left = 0

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            offset = mid * avg_line_length  # Approximate offset for mid line
            file.seek(offset)
            line = file.readline().strip()
            if line == target:
                return mid
            elif line < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return left  # Insertion point
```

**Explanation:**

- **File Handling:** Opens the file in read mode (`'r'`) using `with open(...)` for automatic closure.
- **Estimation:** Calculates `right` based on file size and estimated average line length for initial boundary. Adjust `avg_line_length` for accuracy.
- **Seeking:** Uses `file.seek(offset)` to efficiently jump to the beginning of the `mid`-th line.
- **Comparison:** Compares the read `line` with the `target` and adjusts `left` or `right` accordingly.
- **Insertion Point:** Returns `left` when the loop ends, indicating the correct insertion position.

**Key Points:**

- **Efficiency:** Achieves O(log n) complexity due to halving the search space in each iteration.
- **Direct File Access:** Avoids loading the entire file into memory, making it suitable for large files.
- **Estimation:** The `avg_line_length` estimation improves performance but might require tuning for varying file structures.
- **Error Handling:** Consider adding checks for empty files or invalid target formats for robustness. [end of text]
