Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

## Python Implementations:

**Bubble Sort:**

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
  n = len(arr)
  for i in range(n):
    # Flag to optimize - if no swaps occur, the list is sorted
    swapped = False
    for j in range(0, n-i-1):
      if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
        arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
        swapped = True
    if not swapped:
      break
  return arr

# Example usage
numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
sorted_numbers = bubble_sort(numbers)
print("Sorted array:", sorted_numbers)
```

**Merge Sort:**

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
  if len(arr) <= 1:
    return arr
  mid = len(arr) // 2
  left_half = merge_sort(arr[:mid])
  right_half = merge_sort(arr[mid:])
  return merge(left_half, right_half)

def merge(left, right):
  merged = []
  i = j = 0
  while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
    if left[i] < right[j]:
      merged.append(left[i])
      i += 1
    else:
      merged.append(right[j])
      j += 1
  merged.extend(left[i:])
  merged.extend(right[j:])
  return merged

# Example usage
numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
sorted_numbers = merge_sort(numbers)
print("Sorted array:", sorted_numbers)
```

## Algorithm Discussion and Comparison:

**Bubble Sort:**

* **Concept:** Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The largest element "bubbles" to the end of the list in each pass.
* **Time Complexity:**
    * **Best Case:** O(n) - If the list is already sorted, only one pass is needed.
    * **Average Case:** O(n^2)
    * **Worst Case:** O(n^2)
* **Space Complexity:** O(1) - It sorts in-place.
* **Advantages:** Simple to understand and implement.
* **Disadvantages:** Inefficient for large lists due to its quadratic time complexity.

**Merge Sort:**

* **Concept:** Divides the list into smaller sublists, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted sublists back together.
* **Time Complexity:**
    * **Best Case:** O(n log n)
    * **Average Case:** O(n log n)
    * **Worst Case:** O(n log n)
* **Space Complexity:** O(n) - Requires additional space for temporary storage during merging.
* **Advantages:** Efficient for large lists due to its logarithmic time complexity. Stable sort (preserves the relative order of equal elements).
* **Disadvantages:** More complex to implement than bubble sort. Requires additional memory space.

**Comparison:**

* **Efficiency:** Merge sort is significantly more efficient than bubble sort for large lists due to its O(n log n) time complexity.
* **Space Complexity:** Bubble sort is more space-efficient as it sorts in-place, while merge sort requires additional memory.
* **Implementation Complexity:** Bubble sort is simpler to implement, while merge sort is more complex.
* **Stability:** Merge sort is a stable sort, while bubble sort is not.


In general, **merge sort is the preferred choice for sorting large lists** due to its efficiency. However, **bubble sort might be suitable for small lists or educational purposes** due to its simplicity.
