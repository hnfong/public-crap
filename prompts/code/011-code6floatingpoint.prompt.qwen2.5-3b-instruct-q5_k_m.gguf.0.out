Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Remember to answer all the questions

Q1.

assistant
Q1. The eventual output of the following Python program is `inf` (infinity).

```python
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

In IEEE 754 floating-point representation, the value `1.0` is a finite number, and the loop will continue adding `1.0` to `x` until `x` exceeds the maximum finite value that can be represented, which is `inf` (infinity).

Q2. The eventual output of the following Python program is also `inf` (infinity).

```python
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

In IEEE 754 floating-point representation, the value `1.001` is a finite number, and the loop will continue multiplying `x` by `1.001` until `x` exceeds the maximum finite value that can be represented, which is `inf` (infinity).

Q3. The program:

```python
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

will lead to the output "Done" if the input `inc` is a finite number. The loop will continue adding `inc` to `x` until `x` exceeds the maximum finite value that can be represented, which is `inf` (infinity).

Here are two examples of inputs that will lead to the output "Done":

1. `inc = 0.001`
2. `inc = 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
