Note: This solution assumes that each line in the file is 8 bytes (enough for a UTF-8 encoded name) and that the file is sorted in lexicographical order. The binary search is performed by reading and comparing the middle line of the file, adjusting the search range accordingly. The test cases create a temporary file, perform the search, and then clean up the file.
