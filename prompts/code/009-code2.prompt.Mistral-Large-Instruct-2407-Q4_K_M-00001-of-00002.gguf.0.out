 To perform a binary search directly on a file, we need to be able to efficiently seek to different positions in the file and read lines from those positions. The key challenge is that lines in a file are not of fixed length, so we need to handle variable-length lines correctly.

Here's a step-by-step approach to implement the `binary_search_file` function:

1. **Open the file in binary mode**: This allows us to seek to specific byte positions.
2. **Determine the file size**: This helps in setting the initial search range.
3. **Binary search logic**: Use a binary search algorithm to narrow down the search range.
4. **Reading lines**: When seeking to a specific byte position, read the line starting from that position.
5. **Comparison**: Compare the read line with the target to decide the next step in the binary search.

Here's the implementation of the `binary_search_file` function:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        # Get the size of the file
        f.seek(0, 2)  # Move to the end of the file
        file_size = f.tell()

        # Initialize the search range
        low, high = 0, file_size

        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            f.seek(mid)

            # Read the line starting from the mid position
            # We need to read the next line correctly
            line = b''
            while True:
                f.seek(mid)
                byte = f.read(1)
                if byte == b'\n' or byte == b'':
                    break
                line = byte + line
                mid -= 1

            # Read the actual line starting from the current position
            line = f.readline()

            if line < target:
                low = f.tell()
            else:
                high = mid

        return low

# Example usage
file_path = "myfile.txt"
target = b"2 by"
position = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
print(position)  # Should print 17
```

### Explanation:

1. **Opening the file in binary mode**: `with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:`
2. **Determining the file size**: `f.seek(0, 2)` moves the cursor to the end of the file, and `f.tell()` gives the size of the file.
3. **Binary search logic**: We initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to the file size. The loop continues until `low` is no longer less than `high`.
4. **Reading lines**: We seek to the middle position (`mid`) and read the line starting from that position. We handle the case where the middle position might be in the middle of a line by reading backwards until we find the start of the line.
5. **Comparison**: We compare the read line with the target. If the line is less than the target, we update `low` to the current position. Otherwise, we update `high` to `mid`.

This approach ensures that we perform the binary search directly on the file with at most O(log(n)) operations, where n is the number of lines in the file. [end of text]
