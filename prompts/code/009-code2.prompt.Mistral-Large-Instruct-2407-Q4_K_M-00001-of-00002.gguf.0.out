 To perform a binary search on a file directly, you need to be able to access specific lines in the file without reading the entire file into memory. This can be achieved by using file pointers and seeking to specific positions in the file. Here's a step-by-step approach to implement the `binary_search_file` function:

1. **Determine the File Size**: Get the total number of lines in the file.
2. **Binary Search Logic**: Implement the binary search algorithm to find the target or the insertion point.
3. **Seek and Read**: Use file pointers to seek to specific lines and read them.

Here's the Python code to achieve this:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    import os

    def get_line_count(file_path):
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            return sum(1 for _ in f)

    def read_line_at(file_path, line_number):
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            for current_line_number, line in enumerate(f):
                if current_line_number == line_number:
                    return line.strip()
        return None

    line_count = get_line_count(file_path)
    left, right = 0, line_count - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        mid_line = read_line_at(file_path, mid)

        if mid_line == target:
            return mid
        elif mid_line < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return left  # Insertion point

# Example usage:
# file_path = 'path_to_your_file.txt'
# target = 'target_name'
# position = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
# print(position)
```

### Explanation:

1. **get_line_count(file_path)**:
   - This function counts the total number of lines in the file by iterating through the file once.

2. **read_line_at(file_path, line_number)**:
   - This function reads a specific line from the file by iterating through the file until it reaches the desired line number.

3. **binary_search_file(file_path, target)**:
   - This function performs the binary search. It initializes the `left` and `right` pointers to the start and end of the file, respectively.
   - It then enters a loop where it calculates the middle index (`mid`) and reads the line at that index using `read_line_at`.
   - Depending on whether the middle line is equal to, less than, or greater than the target, it adjusts the `left` and `right` pointers accordingly.
   - If the target is found, it returns the index. If the loop exits without finding the target, it returns the insertion point (`left`).

### Notes:
- This implementation assumes that the file is not too large to be read line-by-line multiple times. For very large files, more efficient seeking methods might be required.
- The `read_line_at` function is not optimized for large files as it reads the file from the beginning each time. For better performance, you might need to implement a more sophisticated method to seek directly to the desired line. [end of text]
