[INST] Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").
[/INST] 1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We need to perform a binary search on a text file containing names sorted in lexicographical order.
   - The goal is to find the position of a target name or the insertion point if the target is not found.
   - The search should be done directly on the file with at most \(O(\log n)\) operations.

2. **Approach**:
   - Since the file is sorted, we can use binary search to efficiently find the target.
   - We need to read the file in chunks to avoid loading the entire file into memory.
   - We will use the `seek` method to move the file pointer and the `readline` method to read lines.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Open the file and determine its size.
   - Use binary search to narrow down the search range.
   - Read the middle line of the current range and compare it with the target.
   - Adjust the search range based on the comparison.

Here is the Python function `binary_search_file`:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Get the size of the file
        file.seek(0, 2)  # Move to the end of the file
        file_size = file.tell()

        # Initialize the search range
        low, high = 0, file_size

        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2

            # Move to the middle position
            file.seek(mid)

            # Read the next line
            file.readline()  # Skip the current line as it might be incomplete
            line = file.readline()

            if not line:
                # If no line is read, adjust the high pointer
                high = mid
                continue

            # Compare the line with the target
            current_name = line.strip()

            if current_name == target:
                # Found the target, return the position
                return mid
            elif current_name < target:
                # Target is in the upper half
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                # Target is in the lower half
                high = mid

        # If the target is not found, return the insertion point
        return low

# Example usage:
# position = binary_search_file('names.txt', 'John')
# print(position)
```

### Explanation:
1. **File Size Determination**:
   - `file.seek(0, 2)` moves the file pointer to the end.
   - `file.tell()` gives the size of the file.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to the file size.
   - Calculate the middle position `mid`.
   - Use `file.seek(mid)` to move to the middle position.
   - Read the next line after the middle position to ensure a complete line is read.
   - Compare the read line with the target and adjust the search range accordingly.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If no line is read (`line` is `None`), adjust the `high` pointer.
   - If the target is found, return the position.
   - If the target is not found, return the insertion point.

This approach ensures that the file is read in chunks, and the search is performed in \(O(\log n)\) time complexity.
