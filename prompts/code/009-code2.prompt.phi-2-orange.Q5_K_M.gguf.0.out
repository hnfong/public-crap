Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a text file with names sorted in lexicographical order directly, you need to read the file line by line and perform the binary search on each line. This way, you can reduce the number of operations required to find the target. The binary search can be performed using the `bisect_left` function from the Python's built-in `bisect` module.

Here's a Python function `binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that performs binary search on the file:

```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()
    positions = [line.index(target) for line in lines if target in line]
    return bisect.bisect_left(positions, 0) if positions else None
```

This function opens the file, reads all lines into a list `lines`, finds the positions of the target in each line using a list comprehension, and finally performs a binary search on the positions list using `bisect.bisect_left`.

Keep in mind that this approach may not work correctly if the names in the file contain spaces, as it performs a direct comparison of strings. If you want to compare names with spaces, you can use the `split` function to split each name into parts and then compare them. Alternatively, you can use the `fnmatch` module to filter out names containing spaces before performing the binary search.

Also, since the file is read line by line, the time complexity of this function is O(n * log(m)), where n is the number of lines in the file and m is the average length of each line (excluding spaces). This makes the overall time complexity O(n * log(n)) for the file read and O(log(n)) for the binary search. This is acceptable for a small file with a large number of names, but for very large files, you might want to consider an alternative approach like an index file or an in-memory sorted list.
