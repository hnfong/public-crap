Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Bubble Sort:
Bubble sort is a simple comparison-based algorithm. It works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Here is a python implementation of bubble sort.

```python
def bubble_sort(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if nums[j] > nums[j+1] :
                nums[j], nums[j+1] = nums[j+1], nums[j]
    return nums
```

Merge Sort:
Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by dividing the list into two halves, sorting them separately, and then merging them back together. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

Here is a python implementation of merge sort.

```python
def merge_sort(nums):
    if len(nums) > 1:
        mid = len(nums) // 2
        left_half = nums[:mid]
        right_half = nums[mid:]

        merge_sort(left_half)
        merge_sort(right_half)

        i = j = k = 0

        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
                nums[k] = left_half[i]
                i = i + 1
            else:
                nums[k] = right_half[j]
                j = j + 1
            k = k + 1

        while i < len(left_half):
            nums[k] = left_half[i]
            i = i + 1
            k = k + 1

        while j < len(right_half):
            nums[k] = right_half[j]
            j = j + 1
            k = k + 1

    return nums
```

Comparison:
Both algorithms sort a list of elements, but they do so in different ways. Bubble sort is a simple algorithm that is easy to understand and implement, but it is not very efficient. Its worst-case time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the list.

Merge sort, on the other hand, is a more complex algorithm, but it is much more efficient than bubble sort. Its worst-case time complexity is O(n log n), which is much better than bubble sort.

Another difference between the two algorithms is their space complexity. Bubble sort requires additional space for temporary variables, so its space complexity is O(1), which is much smaller than merge sort's space complexity of O(n).

In terms of simplicity and efficiency, bubble sort is inferior to merge sort. However, bubble sort is easier to understand and implement, which can be an advantage in certain situations.
