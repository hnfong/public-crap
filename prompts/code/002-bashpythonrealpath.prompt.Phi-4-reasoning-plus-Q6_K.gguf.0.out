We are asked: "Complete the realpath() function: ...". The code snippet is:

```
function realpath() {
    # implement with python
    python3 -c <fill_in_this>
}

set -x
my_real_path=$(realpath "$0")
echo "The real path of this script is $my_real_path"
```

We need to complete the function. The function is supposed to compute the real path of a file. The code snippet is a shell function that calls python3 with a command line argument. The code snippet is incomplete. We need to fill in the python code that computes the real path of a file. The function is called "realpath" and it takes one argument "$0", which is the script's path. The code snippet is:

```
function realpath() {
    # implement with python
    python3 -c <fill_in_this>
}
```

We need to fill in the python code that computes the real path. The python code should be something like:

```
import os, sys
print(os.path.realpath(sys.argv[1]))
```

But careful: The code snippet is "python3 -c <fill_in_this>" so we need to fill in the code inside the quotes. The code should be a valid python code snippet that uses sys.argv[1] to get the file path and then prints the result of os.path.realpath. But note that the code snippet is "python3 -c <fill_in_this>" so we need to fill in the code inside the quotes. The code snippet is:

```
function realpath() {
    # implement with python
    python3 -c "import os, sys; print(os.path.realpath(sys.argv[1]))"
}
```

But careful: The code snippet is in a shell script. The function is defined in a shell script. The code snippet is:
