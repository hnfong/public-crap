We are asked: "Complete the realpath() function: ...". The code snippet is:

```
function realpath() {
    # implement with python
    python3 -c <fill_in_this>
}

set -x
my_real_path=$(realpath "$0")
echo "The real path of this script is $my_real_path"
```

We need to complete the function. The function is supposed to use python3 to compute the real path of a file. The code snippet is a shell function that calls python3 with a command line argument. The code snippet is incomplete. We need to fill in the python code that computes the real path of the file. The file is passed as argument "$0" to the function. So the python code should compute the absolute path of the file, resolving symlinks. We can use os.path.realpath in python. So the code should be something like:

```
import os, sys
print(os.path.realpath(sys.argv[1]))
```

But careful: The function is defined as "function realpath() { ... }" and then "my_real_path=$(realpath "$0")". So the python code should be executed with python3 -c "import os, sys; print(os.path.realpath(sys.argv[1]))" and then the argument is "$0". But note that "$0" is the script file name. But if the script is symlinked, then realpath should resolve it. But the code is "python3 -c <fill_in_this>" so we need to fill in the python code. So the answer is:

```
function realpath() {
    python3 -c "import os, sys; print(os.path.realpath(sys.argv[1]))" "$1"
}
```
