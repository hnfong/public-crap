Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

The program will lead to the output "Done" if the input value for `inc` is such that the loop condition `x < math.inf` is never met. This can happen if `inc` is zero, because adding zero to `x` will not change its value, and the loop will continue indefinitely without ever reaching `math.inf`.

Here are two examples of inputs that will lead to the output "Done":

1. **Input:** `0.0`
   - If `inc` is `0.0`, the loop condition `x < math.inf` will always be true because `x` will never change from `0.0`. The loop will continue indefinitely, but since there is no explicit exit condition other than the loop condition, the program will eventually terminate due to a timeout or other external factors, but it will not print "Done" because the loop condition is never met.

2. **Input:** `-1.0`
   - If `inc` is `-1.0`, the loop condition `x < math.inf` will also always be true because `x` will decrease with each iteration, but it will never reach `math.inf`. The loop will continue indefinitely, and the program will eventually terminate due to a timeout or other external factors, but it will not print "Done" because the loop condition is never met.

In both cases, the loop condition `x < math.inf` is never met, and the program will not print "Done" because the loop will continue indefinitely. [end of text]
