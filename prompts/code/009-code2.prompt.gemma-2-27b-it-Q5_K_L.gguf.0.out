You're right, performing a true binary search directly on a file requires careful handling due to the sequential nature of file access. We can't directly jump to the middle byte like we would in an array.

Here's a breakdown of the approach and a Python implementation:

**Understanding the Challenge**

* **Sequential Access:** Files are typically accessed sequentially. To read a specific byte, we often need to read all preceding bytes.
* **Line Boundaries:** We need to find the start of lines to compare strings, not just arbitrary byte positions.

**The Strategy**

1. **Approximate Midpoint:** We'll use file size to estimate the midpoint.

2. **Read Lines Around Midpoint:** Read lines around the estimated midpoint until we find a line that's lexicographically less than or equal to our target, and the next line is greater.

3. **Adjust Search Range:** Based on the comparison, we narrow down the search range (either the first half or the second half of the file).

4. **Repeat:** Repeat steps 1-3 until we find the target or the search range becomes empty.

**Python Implementation**

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        file_size = f.seek(0, 2)  # Get file size
        left = 0
        right = file_size

        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            f.seek(mid)

            # Find the start of the line containing 'mid'
            f.seek(f.tell() - (f.tell() % 1) - 1, 0)  # Go back to the beginning of the line

            line = f.readline().strip()

            if line <= target:
                left = f.tell()
            else:
                right = f.tell()

        return left

# Example usage
file_path = "myfile.txt"
target = b"2 by"
position = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
print(f"Target found at byte position: {position}")
```

**Explanation**

* **File Size:** We use `f.seek(0, 2)` to get the file size efficiently.
* **Midpoint Calculation:** We calculate the midpoint byte position.
* **Line Finding:** We use `f.tell() % 1` to determine the byte offset within the current line and then backtrack to the beginning of the line.
* **Comparison:** We compare the line with the target.
* **Range Adjustment:** We update `left` or `right` based on the comparison.

**Important Considerations**

* **Line Endings:** This code assumes consistent line endings (e.g., newline characters). Adjust if your file uses different line endings.
* **Large Files:** For extremely large files, you might want to consider buffering to improve performance.
* **Encoding:** Ensure the file encoding matches the encoding used for the `target` string.
