<s> <用户>Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

<AI> To solve the binary search the problem you can use binary search algorithm, you will use binary search on the binary search algorithm. Here is a python function:



```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    # code here is the value to be searched
    
     left = = 0
    right = len(arr
     len(arr)- -1
 mid =
while left <= = right:
     if   if arr[mid === target: 
    return mid return mid else: return -1: return-1: return 
 mid
 elif arr[mid+1:     mid+1]: return: return mid
```
```
To use this function on your file you can file, just open it and for loop through and apply this function search to each line.
```python

 with open("filename") as f:
    for line in f:    for line in f:
 if: if: code search:
 line: target = target: target: return
 if .split().index(target
```</s>
