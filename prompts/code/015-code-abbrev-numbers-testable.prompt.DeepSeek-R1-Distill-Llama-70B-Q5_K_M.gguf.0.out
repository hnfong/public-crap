Okay, I need to write a Python function called abbrev_num that takes an integer and returns a string representing it in a compact, human-readable form. The output should be less than 4 characters if possible. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I should understand the examples given. For instance, 2 stays as "2". 8180 becomes "8.2K", but wait, that's 4 characters. Oh, but the note says that if possible, it should be less than 4. So maybe in some cases, it's allowed to be 4, but we try to make it as short as possible.

Wait, the example for 74581 is "75K" which is 3 characters. So the function should round to the nearest K, M, etc., and choose the largest possible unit so that the number of digits is minimized.

So the steps I need to take are:

1. Determine the appropriate unit (like K for thousand, M for million, etc.) based on the size of the number.
2. Round the number to the nearest significant digit(s) based on the unit, ensuring the total length is under 4 characters.
3. Format the string accordingly, possibly with one decimal place if needed.

Let me think about the units. The units are K (10^3), M (10^6), B (10^9), T (10^12), etc. But for this problem, maybe we only need to handle up to a certain point, but I'll assume that the function should handle any integer.

So first, I need to find the largest unit such that when the number is divided by the unit's value, the result is at least 1. For example, 8180 is 8.18 thousand, so K is appropriate.

Once the unit is determined, I need to round the number to one or two significant digits. Wait, but the output should be as short as possible. So for numbers that can be represented with one digit plus the unit, that's better. For example, 1000 is 1K, which is 2 characters. But 1500 is 1.5K, which is 4 characters. Wait, but 1500 could be rounded to 2K, making it 2K (2 characters). So perhaps the function should round to the nearest unit if that results in fewer characters.

Wait, but the example given for 8180 is 8.2K, which is 4 characters. So perhaps the function allows up to one decimal place if it's necessary to represent the number accurately without exceeding the character limit.

Wait, the note says that for 74581, the output is "75K" instead of "74.5K" because the latter is 5 characters. So the function should prefer rounding to the nearest higher unit if that allows the string to be shorter.

So the approach is: find the largest possible unit such that when the number is divided by the unit, the result can be represented in a way that the total string is as short as possible, preferably under 4 characters.

So the steps I need to take:

1. Determine the magnitude of the number. For example, find the highest power of 1000 that is less than or equal to the number.

2. Once the unit is determined, divide the number by the unit to get a scaled value.

3. Round this scaled value to the nearest 0.1, 0.5, or 1, depending on what allows the string to be the shortest.

Wait, perhaps the scaled value should be rounded to one significant digit if possible, but if that's not possible without losing too much precision, then use two digits.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should represent the number with up to two significant digits, but if the first digit is a 1, maybe it can be represented as a single digit with the next unit. For example, 1000 is 1K, not 1.0K.

Wait, but 1000 is exactly 1K, so that's straightforward. But for 1500, it's 1.5K, which is 4 characters. Alternatively, rounding to 2K would make it 2K, which is 2 characters. So perhaps the function should check whether rounding to the nearest unit (without decimal) would result in a shorter string.

So the plan is:

- For a given number, find the largest unit (like K, M, etc.) such that the number is at least 100 in that unit (e.g., 100K is 100,000, which is 10^5, but perhaps the units are in thousands, millions, etc.)

Wait, perhaps the units are in powers of 1000. So the units are 10^3, 10^6, 10^9, etc.

So first, I'll create a list of units, each with their corresponding divisor and suffix. For example:

units = [
    (10**12, 'T'),
    (10**9, 'B'),
    (10**6, 'M'),
    (10**3, 'K'),
    (1, '')
]

Wait, but for numbers less than 1000, we just return the number as a string.

So the process is:

- Iterate through the units in descending order of magnitude.
- For each unit, if the number is greater than or equal to the unit's divisor, then we use that unit.
- Once the unit is selected, divide the number by the unit's divisor to get the scaled value.
- Then, determine how to represent this scaled value with the least number of digits, ensuring the total string length is under 4.

So for the scaled value, we can represent it as an integer if possible, or with one decimal place.

But how to decide whether to round to the nearest integer or to one decimal place.

Wait, the goal is to have the output string as short as possible, preferably under 4 characters.

So for example:

- If the scaled value is 8.18, then 8.2K is 4 characters. But if we round to 8K, that's 2 characters, which is better. But wait, 8.18 is closer to 8 than 9, so perhaps we should round to 8K.

Wait, but the example given for 8180 is 8.2K. So perhaps the function is supposed to show one decimal place when the number is not a multiple of the unit.

Hmm, perhaps the function should represent the number with up to two significant digits, but if the first digit is 1, it can be represented as a single digit with the next higher unit.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the possible cases.

Case 1: The number is less than 1000. Return as is.

Case 2: The number is between 1000 and 999999. Use K.

Case 3: Between 1e6 and 999,999,999: use M.

And so on.

Once the unit is determined, the scaled value is number / unit_divisor.

Now, the scaled value can be represented in different ways:

- If the scaled value is an integer, then just use that integer followed by the unit. E.g., 2000 becomes 2K.

- If the scaled value has a fractional part, we can represent it with one decimal place, but only if it doesn't make the string too long.

Wait, but the output should be as short as possible. So for example, 1500 is 1.5K (4 characters) or 2K (2 characters). Which is better? According to the note, 74581 becomes 75K (3 characters) instead of 74.5K (5). So the function prefers rounding to the nearest higher unit if it results in a shorter string.

So perhaps the approach is:

For the scaled value, round it to the nearest integer, and see if that gives a shorter string. If so, use that. Otherwise, use one decimal place.

Wait, but how to decide when to round up or down.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should represent the number with one significant digit if possible, otherwise two.

Wait, perhaps the function should format the number to have up to two significant digits, but without trailing zeros after the decimal. So for example:

- 8180 / 1000 = 8.18 → 8.2K (4 characters)
- 74581 / 1000 = 74.581 → rounded to 75K (3 characters)
- 9385832 / 1e6 = 9.38532 → 9.4M (4 characters)

So the function rounds to one decimal place if the scaled value is between 1.0 and
