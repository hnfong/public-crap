Okay, I need to write a Python function called abbrev_num that takes an integer and returns a string representing it in a compact, human-readable form. The output should be as short as possible, preferably under 4 characters. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, I should understand the examples given. For instance, 2 stays as "2". 8180 becomes "8.2K", but wait, that's 4 characters. Oh, but the note says that if the input is 74581, the output should be "75K" instead of "74.5K" because the latter is 5 characters. So the priority is to keep it under or equal to 4 characters.

So the function needs to find the largest possible unit (like K, M, etc.) such that when the number is divided by that unit, the result can be represented with at most two significant digits, possibly with a decimal, but the total length should not exceed 4 characters.

Wait, but the examples show that sometimes it's just one digit plus a decimal and a unit. Like 8.2K is 4 characters. So the maximum allowed is 4, so the function should aim for that.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Determine the magnitude of the number. For example, numbers >=1000 are in K (thousands), >=1,000,000 are in M (millions), etc.

2. Find the appropriate unit (like K, M, G, etc.) based on the number's size.

3. Divide the number by the unit to get a value.

4. Round this value to one or two significant digits, ensuring that the total string length doesn't exceed 4 characters.

Wait, but how do I decide whether to use one or two digits before the decimal? For example, 8180 is 8.18K when divided by 1000. So rounded to one decimal place, it's 8.2K, which is 4 characters. But if the number is 74581, dividing by 1000 gives 74.581, which would round to 74.6K, but that's 5 characters. So instead, we round to 75K, which is 3 characters.

So the approach is to find the largest unit such that when the number is divided by the unit, the result can be represented with up to two significant digits, but the total string length (including the unit) is <=4.

Wait, but how do I handle this? Maybe I should consider the possible units in order from largest to smallest, and for each, check if the resulting string is within 4 characters.

Alternatively, perhaps the steps are:

- For a given x, find the highest possible unit (like K, M, etc.) such that x >= unit.

- Then, compute x / unit, and round it to the appropriate number of significant digits so that when combined with the unit, the total length is <=4.

But how to determine the number of significant digits.

Wait, let's think about the maximum possible digits before the unit. The output can be up to 4 characters, including the unit. So for example, if the unit is 'K', which is 1 character, then the number part can be up to 3 characters. So the number part can be up to 3 digits, but perhaps with a decimal.

Wait, but 3 digits would be 3 characters, plus the unit is 1, total 4. So for example, 999K is 4 characters. But if the number is 1000, it's 1K, which is 2 characters.

Wait, but 1000 is 1K, which is 2 characters. So perhaps the function should represent it as compactly as possible.

So the plan is:

1. Determine the appropriate unit (like K, M, G, etc.) based on the size of x.

2. For each possible unit, starting from the largest possible, check if the number divided by the unit can be represented in a way that the total string is <=4 characters.

3. Once the unit is found, format the number divided by the unit to the minimal number of digits needed, rounding as necessary.

But how to find the unit.

Let me list the units and their corresponding values:

- K: 10^3 (1000)
- M: 10^6 (1,000,000)
- G: 10^9 (1,000,000,000)
- T: 10^12, etc.

So for a given x, we can find the largest unit where x >= unit_value.

But wait, for x=500, it's less than 1000, so no unit is used. So the output is just the number as a string.

So the steps could be:

- If x < 1000: return str(x)
- Else, find the largest unit where x >= unit_value.
- Then, compute x / unit_value.
- Round this value to the appropriate number of significant digits so that when combined with the unit, the total length is <=4.

But how to determine the number of significant digits.

Wait, the maximum allowed is 4 characters. So for example, if the unit is 'K' (1 character), the number part can be up to 3 characters. So the number part can be up to 3 digits, but perhaps with a decimal.

Wait, but 3 digits would be 3 characters, plus the unit is 1, total 4. So for example, 999K is 4 characters.

But if the number is 1234, then 1.234K is 5 characters, which is too long. So we need to round it to 1.2K (4 characters) or 1.3K, but wait, 1234 is 1.234 thousand, which would round to 1.2K if rounded to one decimal place, but that's 4 characters.

Wait, but 1234 is 1.234K, which is 5 characters. So we need to represent it as 1.2K, which is 4.

Alternatively, perhaps we can represent it as 1.2K, but that's 4 characters.

Wait, but 1234 is 1.234K, which is 5 characters. So we need to round it to one decimal place, making it 1.2K, which is 4.

But wait, 1234 is 1.234K, which is 5 characters. So the function should round it to 1.2K, which is 4.

So the approach is: for the number divided by the unit, we need to represent it with as few digits as possible, but ensuring that the total length is <=4.

So perhaps the number part can be up to 3 characters, including a decimal point if needed.

Wait, but 3 characters for the number part. So for example:

- 1.2K is 3 characters for the number part (1, ., 2) plus K is 4 total.

- 12K is 2 characters for the number part plus K is 3 total.

So the function needs to format the number part to fit within 3 characters, possibly using a decimal.

So the steps are:

1. For x < 1000: return str(x)

2. Else, find the largest unit (K, M, etc.) where x >= unit_value.

3. Compute value = x / unit_value.

4. Determine how to format 'value' such that the string representation is as short as possible, but when combined with the unit, the total is <=4.

So for 'value', we can have:

- If value is >=10, then we can represent it as an integer, e.g., 12K.

- If value is between 1 and 10, we can represent it with one decimal place if needed, e.g., 8.2K.

- If value is less than 1, but that's not possible because we've already chosen the largest unit where x >= unit_value.

Wait, no. For example, x=500, unit is nothing. x=1500, unit is K, value is 1.5.

So for value, the possible cases are:

- value >=100: but that's not possible because we've chosen the largest unit. For example, if x is 1,000,000, then unit is K (1000), value is 1000, but that's not possible because the next unit is M (1e6). So perhaps I made a mistake in the unit selection.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The units are K=1e3, M=1e6, G=1e9, etc
