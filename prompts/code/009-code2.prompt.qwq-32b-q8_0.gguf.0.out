Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

Okay, so I need to figure out how to perform a binary search on a text file directly, using at most O(log n) operations. The function has to return the position of the target or the insertion point, similar to bisect_left. Hmm, right, binary search on a file... but how do you do that when the file is on disk and you can't just access elements by index like in a list?

First, I remember that binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. To do this on a file, I need a way to jump to the middle of the current interval and read the line there. But how do you find the middle line quickly?

Wait, the problem says the lines are already sorted lexicographically. So the file is sorted. The challenge is to perform the binary search without loading all the lines into memory, which would be O(n) space. Instead, we need to read the file in a way that allows us to access the middle of the current search range efficiently.

Hmm, the key here is that each line in the file has a position (like a byte offset) where it starts. If I can find the starting position of each line, then I can jump to those positions. But how do I find the middle line's position without reading all the lines?

Alternatively, maybe we can use the file's size to estimate the middle. Let's think: the total number of lines is n, but we don't know n. Wait, but maybe we can approximate the middle by seeking to the middle of the file in bytes. But that might not land exactly on a line. For example, if the file is 1000 bytes, the middle is 500 bytes. But that could be in the middle of a line. So that approach might not work.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a binary search approach where each step involves seeking to a position in the file, then reading forward until we hit a newline to get the line at that position. But how do we choose the position to seek to?

Wait, here's an idea. Let's say the current search interval is between start and end positions in the file. The middle would be (start + end) // 2. We seek to that position, then read forward until we hit a newline to get the line at that position. Then compare that line to the target. Depending on the comparison, we adjust the start or end positions accordingly.

But there's a problem here: seeking to the middle position might land us in the middle of a line. So when we read from that position, we might get part of a line. To get the entire line, we might have to read until the next newline. But that could take some time, but since each step is O(1) in terms of the number of lines, maybe it's okay?

Wait, but each step requires reading a line from the middle, which could take O(1) time if the lines are of average length, but in the worst case, if lines are very long, it could take O(n) time. Hmm, but the problem states that we need to do it in O(log n) operations. So perhaps the number of operations is counted as the number of seeks and reads, but each read is considered an operation. Wait, the problem says "using at most O(log(n)) operations". So each seek and read is considered an operation. So the total number of operations must be logarithmic in the number of lines.

Therefore, the approach must be such that each step reduces the search space by half, and each step requires a constant number of operations (like a seek and a read). So the total steps would be log2(n), hence O(log n) operations.

So here's the plan:

1. The file is sorted, so we can perform binary search on it.

2. The key is to find the middle line of the current search interval. To do this, we can track the start and end positions (byte offsets) of the current interval. The middle is (start + end) // 2. We seek to that position, then read forward until we hit a newline to get the line at that position. However, seeking to the middle might land us in the middle of a line, so we need to read until the next newline to get the line. But once we have that line, we can compare it to the target.

3. Depending on the comparison, we adjust the start or end positions. However, we also need to track the line's position so that we can return the correct insertion point.

Wait, but how do we track the line's position? The insertion point is the first line that is greater than the target. So we need to keep track of the possible insertion points as we go.

Alternatively, the bisect_left logic requires that when the target is not found, we return the index where it would be inserted. Since the file is sorted, each step can narrow down the possible insertion point.

Hmm, perhaps the steps are similar to a standard binary search, but with the added complexity of seeking and reading lines from the file.

Let me outline the steps in code terms:

Initialize low and high as the start and end of the file. The start is 0, and the end is the file size.

While low <= high:

    mid = (low + high) // 2

    seek to mid, then read the line starting at that position (or the next line if mid is in the middle of a line)

    compare the line to the target.

    if the line is less than target, set low = mid + 1 (but need to adjust to the next line's position?)

    else, set high = mid - 1 (again, need to adjust to the previous line's position?)

Wait, but how do we know the exact position of the line we just read? Because when we seek to mid, we might be in the middle of a line. So when we read the line, we have to read until the next newline. The position of that line's start is the current file position after seeking and moving to the start of the line.

Alternatively, perhaps after seeking to mid, we can read the line, but to get the starting position of that line, we need to track it. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Suppose the file is opened in read mode. When you seek to a position, you can then read from there. To get the line at that position, you can read until the next newline. But the starting position of that line is the current position after seeking, but only if the seek position is at the start of a line. Otherwise, the line starts at the first character after the previous newline.

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me think of an example.

Suppose the file has lines like:

Line1\nLine2\nLine3\n...

Suppose the middle position is in the middle of Line2. When we seek there, we can read from that point until the next newline, which would give us the rest of Line2. But to get the entire line, we might need to read from the start of the line. Wait, but how do we find the start of the line?

Alternatively, perhaps the line we read is the one that starts at or after the seek position. So when we read from the seek position, we can read until the next newline, which gives us the line that starts at or after the seek position. But that line's starting position is the seek position, unless the seek position was in the middle of a line. In that case, the line starts at the first character after the previous newline.

Hmm, perhaps the way to get the line at the mid position is to seek to mid, then read until the next newline. The line we get is the line that contains the mid position. But that line's starting position is the first character after the previous newline. To track that, perhaps we can note the current position after seeking and then moving to the start of the line.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact starting position of the line is not necessary for the binary search, as long as we can compare the line's content. But for the insertion point, we need to know the position where the line would be inserted, which is the line number (or the byte offset of the line where it would be placed).

Wait, the problem says to return the position of the target, or the insertion point as in bisect_left. So the insertion point is the index where the target would be inserted to maintain sorted order. But since the file is on disk, the position is probably the byte offset where the line starts. Or maybe the line number? The problem says "position", but in the context of a file, it's more likely the byte offset.

Hmm, the problem says "returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in 'bisect_left')". The bisect module in Python returns the insertion point as an index. But in the case of a file, perhaps the position is the byte offset where the line starts. So the function needs to return either the byte offset of the target line, or the byte offset where the target would be inserted.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects the line number (0-based) as the position. But the problem isn't clear. Since the user is asking for a Python function, perhaps the bisect_left insertion point is the line number. But the problem says "position of the target", which could be the line number. Hmm, but the problem says "the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in bisect_left)". Since bisect_left returns an index, perhaps the function should return the line number where the target is found, or the insertion index if not found.

Alternatively, maybe the position refers to the byte offset in the file. But the problem is a bit ambiguous. However, given that it's a file, perhaps the insertion point is the line number where the target would be inserted, so the function can return that as an integer. But how do we track the line numbers?

Alternatively, perhaps the function can return the byte offset where the line starts, so that the insertion point is the byte offset where the new line would be placed. But that complicates things because the insertion point would be between two lines, so the byte offset would be the start of the line after the insertion point.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects the line number (as in bisect_left's index) rather than the byte offset. But how do we track that without reading all the lines?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is okay with returning the byte offset of the line where the target is found, or the byte offset where the insertion would occur. But how do we track that?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the line number, so the function can return that. But to get the line number, we need to know how many lines are before the current line. But that's tricky because we can't count all lines each time.

Hmm, perhaps the key is to track the possible insertion point as we go through the binary search steps, similar to how bisect_left works. Let me think of the standard binary search algorithm for bisect_left:

Initialize low = 0, high = len(a). While low < high, etc. The insertion point is low at the end.

So perhaps in this case, the insertion point can be tracked similarly, but using the byte positions. Let me try to outline the steps again.

Initialize low_byte = 0, high_byte = file_size.

The insertion point starts as 0, but perhaps we can track it as we go.

Wait, maybe the algorithm can be structured as follows:

Initialize low and high as the start and end of the file (in bytes). The insertion point is initially 0.

While low <= high:

    mid_byte = (low + high) // 2

    seek to mid_byte, then read the line starting at that position (or the next line if mid_byte is in the middle of a line). Let's call this line's content 'current_line'.

    Also, note the starting byte of this line, let's call it 'mid_line_start'.

    Compare current_line to target:

    if current_line < target:

        low = mid_line_start + len(current_line) + 1  # the next line's start position?

        insertion_point = mid_line_start + len(current_line) + 1  # or something else?

    else:

        high = mid_line_start - 1  # but how to get the previous line's start?

        insertion_point remains as the current insertion point?

Hmm, this is getting complicated. The problem is that when you seek to mid_byte, you might land in the middle of a line, so the actual line you read starts at some position before mid_byte (the start of the line) or after mid_byte (the next line). So to get the starting position of the line you read, you need to track that.

Alternatively, perhaps after seeking to mid_byte, you can read the line, and then the starting position of that line is the current file position after seeking and moving back to the start of the line. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, here's a possible approach:

When you seek to mid_byte, you can read the line starting at that position. To get the starting position of that line, you can:

- After seeking to mid_byte, read until the next newline. The line you read is the line that starts at the first character after the previous newline. The starting position of that line is the first position after the previous newline. To find that, you can backtrack from mid_byte until you find a newline, but that could be time-consuming.

Hmm, that's a problem. Because backtracking could take O(n) time in the worst case, which would ruin the O(log n) operations.

Alternatively, perhaps we can just read the line starting at mid_byte, and then the starting position is the current position after seeking. Wait, no. Let me think in code terms.

Suppose the file is opened in read mode. Let's say:

with open(file_path, 'r') as f:

    f.seek(mid_byte)

    current_line = f.readline()

    # the starting position of current_line is mid_byte, but only if mid_byte was at the start of the line.

    # Otherwise, the line starts at some position before mid_byte?

Wait, no. The readline() function reads until the next newline, so the current_line is the line that starts at the first character after the previous newline before mid_byte. Wait, no. Let me think again.

Suppose the file has lines like:

Line1\nLine2\nLine3\n...

Suppose mid_byte is in the middle of Line2. When you seek to mid_byte, the current position is in the middle of Line2. Then, f.readline() will read from that position until the next newline, which is the end of Line2. So the current_line is the rest of Line2 starting at mid_byte. But the actual line is Line2, which starts at the beginning of Line2. So the starting position of Line2 is before mid_byte. But how do we get that?

Hmm, this is a problem. Because if we just read the line from mid_byte, we can't know the starting position of the line unless we backtrack to find the previous newline. But backtracking could take O(n) time, which is not acceptable.

So perhaps this approach won't work. Maybe there's another way.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the lines are sorted, so even if we read a partial line, we can still compare the content. Wait, but if we read from mid_byte, the line we get is the rest of the line starting at mid_byte. But that's not the entire line. So comparing that partial line to the target would be incorrect.

Hmm, so that approach won't work. So maybe we need to read the entire line that contains the mid_byte. To do that, we have to find the start of the line. But how?

Alternatively, perhaps we can read backward from mid_byte to find the start of the line. But that would require seeking backward and reading until a newline is found. But in the worst case, this could take O(n) time, which is not acceptable.

Hmm, this is a problem. Maybe the only way to do this efficiently is to assume that each line is of a fixed length, but the problem doesn't state that. So that's not a valid assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps the lines are not too long, so that even if we have to read a line from mid_byte, the average length is manageable. But the problem requires O(log n) operations, so each step must take O(1) time in terms of the number of operations (seeks and reads).

Hmm, perhaps the solution is to use the fact that the lines are sorted lexicographically, so even if we read a partial line, we can still determine whether to go left or right. Wait, but that's not true. For example, if the target is "apple" and the line we read is "app...", but the full line is "application", which is greater than "apple", but the partial line "app" is less. So comparing the partial line would give the wrong result.

Therefore, we must read the entire line that is at the mid position. To do that, we need to find the start of the line. But how?

Hmm, perhaps the only way is to read forward from mid_byte until the end of the line, but that gives us the rest of the line. Then, to get the entire line, we need to read backward from mid_byte to find the start. But that's not feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps we can read the line starting at mid_byte, then read the previous line by seeking backward. But this is getting too complicated.

Wait, maybe the problem expects us to treat the file as a list of lines, and each time we can seek to a position and read the line at that position, but the position is in terms of lines, not bytes. But how do you seek to a line number without reading all lines before it?

Ah, right, that's the crux. To perform a binary search on the lines, you need to be able to access the middle line quickly. But without knowing the line count, and without an index, you can't directly seek to the middle line.

Hmm, perhaps the solution is to use the file's size to approximate the middle line's position. Let's think of the file as a sequence of bytes. The total number of lines is n, but we don't know n. However, the total size is S bytes. The average line length is S/n. But since we don't know n, perhaps we can use the current search interval's byte range to approximate the middle line.

Wait, here's an alternative approach inspired by the way binary search works on a file:

The algorithm will track the current search interval in terms of byte positions. The low and high variables represent the start and end of the current interval. The middle is (low + high) // 2. We seek to that position, then read the line starting at that position (or the next line if we are in the middle of a line). The key is that even if we are in the middle of a line, the line we read is the one that contains the middle position. But to get the entire line, we can read from the current position until the next newline. The content of that line can be compared to the target.

Once we have the line's content, we can decide whether to go left or right. However, the problem is that the line's starting position is not known, so we can't directly adjust the low and high variables to the next or previous line's positions. But perhaps we can approximate it.

Wait, here's the plan:

Initialize low = 0, high = file_size.

While low <= high:

    mid = (low + high) // 2

    seek to mid, then read the line starting at that position (or the next line if mid is in the middle of a line). Let's call this line's content 'current_line'.

    Also, note the starting position of this line (the position where we started reading the line). Let's call this 'mid_line_start'.

    Compare current_line to target:

    if current_line < target:

        # Need to search the right half. The next line after mid_line_start is the start of the next interval.

        low = mid_line_start + len(current_line) + 1  # assuming the line ends with a newline, so +1 for the newline.

    else:

        # Need to search the left half. The previous line's end is the end of the current interval.

        high = mid_line_start - 1  # but how to find the previous line's end?

Wait, but how do we find mid_line_start? Because when we seek to mid, we might be in the middle of a line. So the actual line we read starts at some position before mid. To find that position, we have to backtrack from mid until we find a newline. But that could take O(n) time in the worst case, which is not acceptable.

Hmm, this is a problem. So perhaps the only way to do this is to read the line starting at mid, but then the starting position of that line is the current file position after seeking and moving to the start of the line. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, perhaps we can read the line starting at mid, and then the starting position is the current position after seeking. Wait, no. Let me think in code:

Suppose we have a file object f. We do:

f.seek(mid)

current_line = f.readline()

The current_line is the line starting at the first character after the previous newline before mid, or starting at mid if mid is at the beginning of a line. The starting position of current_line is the position where the line starts, which is the position after the previous newline. But how do we get that position?

The position after reading the line would be mid + len(current_line). But the starting position is mid minus the number of characters between the previous newline and mid. Hmm, this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps we can track the starting position of the line by noting the current position before reading the line. Wait, here's an idea:

After seeking to mid, the current position is mid. Then, we can read the line, but to find the start of the line, we can read backward until we find a newline. But that's not feasible for large files.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to ignore the exact line positions and just use the byte positions for the binary search, even if it's approximate. Because in the worst case, the number of steps would still be logarithmic in the number of lines, even if each step takes some time.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows us to read the entire line from the mid position, and then use that line's content for comparison, even if we can't track its exact position. But then, how do we adjust the low and high variables?

Wait, perhaps the low and high can be adjusted based on the current line's content, but not the exact position. For example, if the current line is less than the target, then the target must be in the right half of the file. So we set low to mid + 1 (the next byte after mid). But this might not land us on the next line's start, but over time, the binary search would still converge.

Wait, but this might not work because the next line could be very long, so the mid might be in the middle of a line that's less than the target, but the next line could be way further ahead. Hmm, but perhaps the binary search would still work because the lines are sorted lexicographically, so the content comparison is sufficient even if the byte positions are approximate.

Wait, let's think of an example. Suppose the file has three lines:

Line1 (length 5 bytes including newline)
Line2 (length 5 bytes)
Line3 (length 5 bytes)

Total size is 15 bytes. The middle is at 7.5, so mid is 7. Seeking to 7 would land in the middle of Line2. The line read would be the rest of Line2. Comparing that to the target, say "Line3", which is greater. So we need to search the right half. The new low would be 8 (mid + 1). The next mid would be (8 + 14) // 2 = 11. Seeking to 11 would land in Line3. Then we can compare and find the target.

So in this case, it works. But what if the lines are of varying lengths?

Another example: suppose the first line is very long, say 1000 bytes, and the rest are short. The middle of the file in bytes would be in the first line. But the first line's content is "A", which is less than the target "Z". So we need to search the right half. But the right half would start at mid + 1, which is after the first line. So the next mid would be in the second half of the file, which contains the other lines. So it would work.

Hmm, perhaps this approach can work. The key is that even if the mid is in the middle of a line, the content comparison will still allow us to decide whether to go left or right. The exact byte positions of the lines don't matter as long as the content is compared correctly.

Therefore, the steps would be:

Initialize low = 0, high = file_size.

While low <= high:

    mid = (low + high) // 2

    seek to mid, read the line starting at that position (using readline())

    current_line = the line read (could be a partial line if mid is in the middle of a line)

    Wait, no. The readline() function reads until the next newline, so the current_line is the line that starts at the first character after the previous newline before mid. So the content is correct, but the starting position is not known.

    However, the content can be compared to the target.

    So compare current_line to target:

    if current_line < target:

        low = mid + 1

    else:

        high = mid - 1

Wait, but this might not work because the line we read could be the line before the actual middle line. For example, if mid is in the middle of a line that is less than the target, then we need to search the right half. But setting low to mid + 1 would move past the current line's end, but the next line could be the one we need.

Hmm, but the problem is that the line's content is correct, so the comparison is valid. The binary search can proceed based on the content comparison, even if the exact position is not known. The low and high variables are adjusted based on the byte positions, but the actual lines are sorted, so the content comparison will guide the search correctly.

Wait, but how do we know when we've found the target? Because the line we read might be a partial line, but the full line's content is what's important. For example, if the target is exactly the line we read, then we can return the current position. But how do we know the starting position of that line?

Ah, right, the problem requires returning the position of the target. So if the current_line is the target, we need to return the starting byte of that line. But how do we track that?

Hmm, this complicates things. Because to return the correct position, we need to know the starting byte of the line that matches the target. So perhaps during the binary search, whenever we read a line, we also track its starting position.

Wait, here's an idea: when we read the line at mid, we can note the starting position as the current file position before reading the line. Wait, let me think in code:

Suppose we have a file object f. We do:

f.seek(mid)

start_pos = f.tell()  # this is mid

current_line = f.readline()

So the current_line is read from mid. The start of the line is the first character after the previous newline before mid. But the start_pos is mid, which may not be the actual start of the line. So this approach won't give us the correct starting position.

Hmm, so perhaps we need to track the starting position of the line we read. To do that, after seeking to mid, we can read the line, but also track the starting position by moving backward until we find a newline. But that's not feasible for large files.

Alternatively, perhaps we can read the line, and then the starting position is the current position minus the length of the line (including the newline). Wait, no. Let me think:

Suppose after seeking to mid and reading the line, the current position is mid + len(current_line). The starting position of the line is the position where the line begins, which is the first character after the previous newline. To find that, we can subtract the length of the line from the current position. But that would give us the starting position only if the line was read completely from the start. But if mid was in the middle of the line, then the line's starting position is before mid.

Hmm, this is getting too complicated. Maybe the problem expects us to return the line number, not the byte offset. In that case, perhaps we can track the line number as we go.

Wait, but how do we track the line number without counting all lines up to that point?

Hmm, perhaps the solution is to use the bisect module's approach but with the file's lines. But since we can't load all lines into memory, we have to read them on the fly.

Alternatively, here's another approach inspired by the way binary search works on a file:

The algorithm will track the current search interval in terms of byte positions. The low and high variables represent the start and end of the current interval. The middle is (low + high) // 2. We seek to that position and read the line starting at that position (or the next line if mid is in the middle of a line). The content of that line is compared to the target. Based on the comparison, we adjust low and high. The key is that even if the line is read from the middle, its content is correct for comparison. The insertion point can be tracked as the current low or high.

Wait, but how do we track the insertion point? Let's think of the bisect_left logic:

Initialize low = 0, high = n (number of lines). The insertion point starts as 0. While low < high, etc. The insertion point is low at the end.

In this case, since we don't know n, but we can track the insertion point in terms of byte positions. Let me try to outline the steps again:

Initialize low_byte = 0, high_byte = file_size.

insertion_point = 0

while low_byte <= high_byte:

    mid_byte = (low_byte + high_byte) // 2

    # seek to mid_byte and read the line starting there

    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:

        f.seek(mid_byte)

        current_line = f.readline()

        # get the starting position of this line. Hmm, but how?

        # perhaps the starting position is the current position after seeking?

        # no, because if mid_byte is in the middle of a line, the line starts before mid_byte.

        # so the starting position is unknown.

        # but for the purpose of comparison, the content is sufficient.

        if current_line == target:

            # found the line. Need to find its starting position.

            # but how?

            # perhaps we can backtrack to find the start of the line.

            # but that's time-consuming.

            # Alternatively, return mid_byte as an approximation?

            # Not sure.

            # For now, assume we can return the starting position somehow.

            return start_pos_of_current_line

        elif current_line < target:

            low_byte = mid_byte + 1

            insertion_point = mid_byte + 1

        else:

            high_byte = mid_byte - 1

            # insertion_point remains as previous?

            # Not sure.

Wait, this is getting too stuck. Maybe the problem expects us to return the line number, and to track that, we can count the number of lines read so far. But that would require reading lines from the start each time, which is O(n) time.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me think of the problem again: the file is sorted, and we need to perform a binary search with O(log n) operations. Each operation is a seek and a read.

The key insight is that each step of the binary search reduces the search space by half, so the number of steps is logarithmic. Each step requires a seek to the middle of the current interval and reading the line there. The line's content is compared to the target, and the search continues in the appropriate half.

The problem is that the middle of the current interval in bytes may not correspond to the middle line. But since the lines are sorted lexicographically, the content comparison is sufficient to determine the direction of the search. The exact line's position (byte offset) can be tracked as we go.

Wait, here's a possible solution:

The function will perform the binary search using byte positions. The low and high variables represent the current search interval in bytes. The middle is (low + high) // 2. We seek to that position and read the line starting there. The content of that line is compared to the target. Based on the comparison, we adjust low and high. The insertion point is tracked as the current low.

Wait, but how do we know when we've found the target? Let's see:

Initialize low = 0, high = file_size.

insertion_point = 0

while low <= high:

    mid = (low + high) // 2

    seek to mid, read the line (current_line)

    if current_line == target:

        # need to find the exact starting position of this line.

        # but how?

        # perhaps we can backtrack to find the start of the line.

        # but that's time-consuming.

        # Alternatively, return mid as an approximate position?

        # Not sure.

        # For now, assume we can return the starting position.

        return start_pos_of_current_line

    elif current_line < target:

        low = mid + 1

        insertion_point = low

    else:

        high = mid - 1

At the end, return insertion_point.

But the problem is that the insertion_point is in terms of byte positions, not line numbers. The bisect_left insertion point is the index where the target would be inserted, which is a line number. So perhaps the function should return the line number, but how to track that?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows returning the byte offset where the line starts, which is the position. So the insertion point is the byte offset where the new line would be inserted.

But how to track that?

Hmm, perhaps the insertion point can be tracked as the current low. Because in bisect_left, the insertion point is the first position where the target could be inserted. So in the binary search steps, whenever we move the low up, the insertion point moves with it.

Wait, let's think of the bisect_left algorithm:

Initialize low = 0, high = len(a)

while low < high:

    mid = (low + high) // 2

    if a[mid] < target:

        low = mid + 1

    else:

        high = mid

return low

So in this case, the insertion point is low. So in our case, if we track low and high as byte positions, then the insertion point would be the final low value. But the problem is that the low and high are in bytes, not line numbers. So the final low would be a byte position, which is the position where the insertion would occur.

Therefore, the function can return the final low value as the position. If the target is found, then during the loop, when current_line equals the target, we can return the starting byte position of that line. But how to find that?

Hmm, perhaps the function can proceed as follows:

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):

    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:

        low = 0

        high = f.seek(0, 2)  # get the file size

        insertion_point = 0

        while low <= high:

            mid = (low + high) // 2

            # seek to mid and read the line

            f.seek(mid)

            current_line = f.readline()

            # compare current_line to target

            if current_line == target:

                # need to find the starting position of this line.

                # but how?

                # perhaps we can backtrack to find the start of the line.

                # but that's time-consuming.

                # Alternatively, return mid as an approximate position?

                # Not sure.

                # For now, return mid as the position.

                return mid

            elif current_line < target:

                low = mid + 1

                insertion_point = low

            else:

                high = mid - 1

        return insertion_point

Wait, but this has several issues:

1. When seeking to mid and reading the line, current_line may be a partial line if mid is in the middle of a line. So the comparison may be incorrect.

2. The starting position of the line is not tracked, so even if current_line equals the target, the returned mid is not the actual starting position.

Hmm, this approach won't work because of the first issue. The comparison could be wrong if the line is read from the middle.

So perhaps the only way to do this correctly is to read the entire line that contains the mid position. To do that, we need to find the start of the line by backtracking from mid until a newline is found. But this could take O(n) time in the worst case, which is not acceptable for O(log n) operations.

Hmm, perhaps the problem expects us to assume that each line is short enough that reading backward from mid to find the start of the line is feasible within the O(log n) steps. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows us to treat the file as a list of lines and use the bisect module's functions, but that would require reading all lines into memory, which is O(n) space, which is not allowed.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for existing algorithms for binary search on a file.

After a quick search in my mind, I recall that
