What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
assistant
The output of the program is:

25.09999999999997

The loop continues until x becomes greater than math.inf, which is positive infinity. The variable x starts at 1.0 and is multiplied by 1.001 in each iteration of the loop, causing it to increase rapidly. The loop stops when x becomes greater than math.inf, at which point the program prints the value of x.
