Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

---

Remember to answer all the questions

Q1.

assistant
The eventual output of the program is `inf`. This is because the loop continues indefinitely as `x` is always incremented by `1.0`, which is less than `math.inf`. Therefore, `x` never reaches `math.inf`, and the loop keeps running. When the loop finally ends, it prints the value of `x`, which is `inf`.

Q2. The eventual output of the program is approximately `1.000249`. This is because the loop continues indefinitely as `x` is always multiplied by `1.001`, which is slightly greater than `1`. Therefore, `x` grows without bound. However, due to the limited precision of floating-point arithmetic, the value of `x` will eventually become so large that it effectively behaves like infinity. In this case, the output is approximately `1.000249`.

Q3. The program will output "Done" if the input value for `inc` is `0.0`. This is because the loop condition is `x < math.inf`, and with an increment of `0.0`, `x` will never reach `math.inf`. Another possible input is any very small positive number, such as `1e-20`. With such an input, the loop will still run indefinitely, but due to the extremely small increment, it will take a very long time for `x` to reach a value that is effectively considered as `math.inf`.
