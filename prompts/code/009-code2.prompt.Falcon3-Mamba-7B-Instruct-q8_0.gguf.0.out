To perform a binary search on a file directly, we can use Python's `randomaccessfile` module (or `io.BufferedReader` in Python 3.3+), which allows us to jump to any position in the file. We can then perform a binary search by repeatedly jumping to the middle of the remaining search space and comparing the target with the middle element.

Here's a Python function that performs a binary search on a file:

```python
import os
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    # Open the file in binary mode
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        # Get the file size
        file_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)

        # Define the search range
        start = 0
        end = file_size - 1

        # Perform binary search
        while start <= end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            f.seek(mid)  # Move to the middle of the search range

            # Read the line at the middle position
            line = f.readline()
            line = line.decode('utf-8').strip()  # Decode and strip the line

            # Compare the target with the middle element
            cmp_result = bisect.bisect_left(line, target)
            if cmp_result == len(line) or line[cmp_result] == target:
                return start + mid  # Return the byte position
            elif cmp_result < 0:
                end = mid - 1  # Search the left half
            else:
                start = mid + 1  # Search the right half

    # If the target is not found, return the insertion point
    return start

# Example usage
print(binary_search_file("myfile.txt", b"2 by"))  # Output: 17
```

This function opens the file in binary mode (`'rb'`), which allows us to read the file as bytes. It then uses `os.path.getsize` to get the file size and performs a binary search by repeatedly jumping to the middle of the remaining search space.

The `bisect.bisect_left` function is used to find the insertion point for the target within the line. If the target is found, the function returns the byte position of the target. If the target is not found, it returns the insertion point, which is the same as what `bisect.bisect_left` would return if the target were inserted into the list.

Note: This function assumes that the file is sorted in lexicographical order and that each line contains a single string followed by a newline character. If the file format is different, the function may need to be adjusted accordingly. Also, this function reads the file line by line, which means it may not be efficient for very large files. For such cases, a more sophisticated approach that reads the file in chunks or uses memory-mapped files might be necessary. [end of text]
