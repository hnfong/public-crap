To perform a binary search on a file directly, we can use a technique called "binary search on disk". This approach allows us to leverage the sorted nature of the file to perform a binary search without loading the entire file into memory. The idea is to repeatedly divide the file into halves and read the middle element until we find the target or determine the insertion point.

Here's how you can implement the `binary_search_file` function:

```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    """
    Perform a binary search on a file containing sorted names.
    
    Args:
    file_path (str): Path to the file containing sorted names.
    target (str): The target name to search for.
    
    Returns:
    int: The position of the target in the file, or the insertion point.
    """
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Read the first and last lines to determine the range
        first_line = file.readline().strip()
        last_line = file.readline().strip()
        file.seek(0)  # Reset file pointer to the beginning
        
        # Use bisect_left to find the insertion point
        index = bisect.bisect_left(file, target, key=lambda line: line.strip())
        
        # Close the file
        file.close()
        
        # Return the index
        return index

# Example usage:
# Assuming 'names.txt' contains sorted names, one per line
# print(binary_search_file('names.txt', 'target_name'))
```

### Explanation:
1. **Reading the First and Last Lines**: We read the first and last lines of the file to determine the range of the binary search. This helps us understand the lexicographical bounds of the file.
2. **Using `bisect_left`**: The `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module is used to find the insertion point for the target in the file. This function performs a binary search and returns the index where the target should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
3. **File Handling**: We open the file once, read the first and last lines, and then use `bisect_left` to perform the search. After the search, we close the file to free up resources.
4. **Return Value**: The function returns the index where the target is found or the insertion point if the target is not present.

This approach ensures that we perform at most O(log(n)) operations, where n is the number of lines in the file, making it efficient for large files. [end of text]
