We are asked: "Here's a coding task. Please read the requirements carefully as it may contain some nuance." The task: "You are required to write a function that takes in an integer. The output should be a string that roughly represents the number in compact, human readable form. for example, input/output pairs may be:

- 2 => 2
- 8180 => 8.2K
- 9385832 => 9.4M

The idea is to represent the number with a couple significant digits and give the order of magnitude.

The output string should be <= 4 characters if at all possible.
So if the input is 74581, output should be "75K" (rounded to nearest K) instead of "74.5K" since the latter is 5 characters which exceed the 4 character limit.

You should use python to write the function. The function should be defined as def abbrev_num(x):. Only write the function. Do not write the main program or test cases."

We need to produce a function that takes an integer x and returns a string that is a compact representation. The examples: 2 => "2", 8180 => "8.2K", 9385832 => "9.4M". Also, if input is 74581, output should be "75K" (rounded to nearest K) instead of "74.5K" because that would be 5 characters. So the function should produce a string that is at most 4 characters if possible. The function should use significant digits and order of magnitude. The function should be defined as def abbrev_num(x):.

We need to consider the following: The function should produce a string that is a compact representation of the number. The examples: if x is less than 1000, then just return the number as a string. But if x is 8180, then we want to produce "8.2K". But if x is 74581, then we want to produce "75K" because "74.5K" is 5 characters. So the rounding should be done such that the output string is <= 4 characters if possible. But what does "if at all possible" mean? It means that if the number is such that rounding to one decimal place would produce a string with 5 characters, then we should round to the nearest integer instead. But wait, let's check: For 8180, if we round to nearest integer, we get "8K" which is 2 characters, but that might not be as accurate as "8.2K"? But the example says 8180 => "8.2K". So maybe the rule is: if the number is less than 1000, just return the number as a string. For numbers >= 1000, we want to choose the appropriate suffix: K for thousands, M for millions, etc. But then we want to choose the number of significant digits such that the output string is <= 4 characters if possible. But the examples: 8180 => "8.2K" is 4 characters. But if we try to produce "8.2K", that's 4 characters. But if we try to produce "8.2K" for 9385832, that's 4 characters as well. But if we try to produce "9.4M" for 9385832, that's 4 characters. But if we try to produce "74.5K" for 74581, that's 5 characters, so we want to round to "75K" which is 3 characters. So the rule is: if rounding to one decimal place yields a string that is 5 characters or more, then round to the nearest integer instead. But wait, what if rounding to one decimal place yields a string that is exactly 4 characters? Then we use that. But what if rounding to one decimal place yields a string that is less than 4 characters? That is possible if the number is small. But then we want to produce a string that is as accurate as possible while not exceeding 4 characters. But the problem says "The output string should be <= 4 characters if at all possible." So if the number is such that rounding to one decimal place would produce a string that is 5 characters, then we should round to the nearest integer. But what if rounding to one decimal place produces a string that is 4 characters? Then we use that. But what if rounding to one decimal place produces a string that is 3 characters? Then we might want to consider if we can add a decimal point to get more precision? But the requirement says "roughly represents the number in compact, human readable form" and "The idea is to represent the number with a couple significant digits and give the order of magnitude." So maybe the idea is: if the number is less than 1000, just return the number as a string. Otherwise, determine the order of magnitude suffix: K for thousands, M for millions, etc. Then compute the scaled value = x / (1000**order). Then decide how many significant digits to show. The examples: 8180 becomes 8.2K, which is 8.2. That is 2 significant digits? Actually, 8.2 has two significant digits. 9385832 becomes 9.4M, which is 9.4. That is 2 significant digits. But 74581 becomes 75K, which is 75, i.e. 2 significant digits but no decimal point. But wait, why would we choose 2 significant digits sometimes and sometimes 1? Let's analyze: For 8180, if we try to use 2 significant digits, we get 8.2K. For 9385832, 2 significant digits gives 9.4M. For 74581, 2 significant digits gives 7.5K, but that's 3 characters? Actually, 7.5K is 4 characters? Let's check: "7.5K" is 4 characters. But the requirement says if the input is 74581, output should be "75K" (rounded to nearest K) instead of "74.5K" since the latter is 5 characters which exceed the 4 character limit. Wait, why "74.5K" would be 5 characters? Let's check: "74.5K" is 5 characters. But "7.5K" is 4 characters. So maybe the idea is: if rounding to one decimal place yields a string that is 5 characters, then round to the nearest integer. But then why would "7.5K" be 4 characters? Let's check: "7.5K" is 4 characters. But the example says 74581 should output "75K", not "7.5K". Let's recalc: 74581 / 1000 = 74.581. Rounding to one decimal place gives 74.6, which is 5 characters if we include the decimal point? Let's check: "74.6K" is 5 characters. But if we round to the nearest integer, we get 75, which is 2 digits, and then add "K" gives "75K", which is 3 characters. But wait, why did they mention "74.5K" in the example? They said: "So if the input is 74581, output should be '75K' (rounded to nearest K) instead of '74.5K' since the latter is 5 characters which exceed the 4 character limit." So they are comparing "74.5K" vs "75K". But why would one get "74.5K"? Let's check: if we use 2 significant digits, then 74581 / 1000 = 74.581, rounding to 2 significant digits: The first two digits are "74", but then the next digit is 5, so rounding would yield "75"? But then if we want to show one decimal place, we might get "74.6K" if rounding to one decimal place. But the example says "74.5K" is 5 characters, but "74.6K" is also 5 characters. Let's check: "74.6K" is 5 characters. But they said "74.5K" is 5 characters. Possibly they are using a different rounding method? Let's recalc: 74581 / 1000 = 74.581. If we want to round to one decimal place, normally we would get 74.6 (because 74.581 rounds to 74.6, not 74.5). But the example says "74.5K" is 5 characters, which is not the correct rounding to one decimal place. Let's check: maybe they want to round to the nearest 10? Because 74581 is closer to 75000 than to 74000, so rounding to the nearest 10 gives 75000, and then divided by 1000 gives 75, so "75K". But then why would we ever show a decimal point? Let's re-read the problem statement: "The idea is to represent the number with a couple significant digits and give the order of magnitude." That suggests that we want to show maybe 1 or 2 significant digits. But then the requirement "The output string should be <= 4 characters if at all possible." means that if rounding to one decimal place would produce a string that is 5 characters, then we should round to the nearest integer instead. So the algorithm might be: if x < 1000, return str(x). Otherwise, determine the order of magnitude: for thousands, use suffix "K", for millions, "M", etc. Let's denote factor = 10^(3*order) where order is such that x/factor is between 100 and 1000 maybe? But then we want to choose the number of significant digits such that the string length is <= 4. The string length is computed as len(str(rounded_value)) + len(suffix). We want that to be <= 4 if possible. But we want to show as many significant digits as possible while not exceeding 4 characters. But the examples: For 8180, if we try to show 2 significant digits, we get "8.2K" which is 4 characters. For 9385832, 2 significant digits gives "9.4M" which is 4 characters. For 74581, 2 significant digits would give "7.5K" if we round to one decimal place, but that's 4 characters. But the example says "75K" is the desired output, not "7.5K". Let's recalc: 74581 / 1000 = 74.581. If we want 2 significant digits, normally we would round to 75 (if rounding to nearest integer) or 74.6 if rounding to one decimal place. But which one is correct? Let's check: if we want to show 2 significant digits, the first two digits of 74.581 are "74", but then the next digit is 5, so rounding would yield "75" if rounding to the nearest integer. But if we want to show one decimal place, we would get "74.6", which is 5 characters. But maybe the rule is: if the scaled value is >= 100, then we want to show no decimal point because that would exceed 4 characters. Let's check: For 74581, scaled value is 74.581, which is two digits before the decimal point. If we add a decimal point and one digit after, that would be 5 characters ("74.6K" or "74.5K"). But if we round to the nearest integer, we get "75K", which is 3 characters. But wait, what about 8180? 8180 / 1000 = 8.18, which is one digit before the decimal point. If we round to the nearest integer, we get "8K", which is 2 characters, but that loses precision. So maybe the rule is: if the scaled value is less than 100, then show one decimal place, otherwise show no decimal point. Let's test: For 8180, scaled value is 8.18, which is less than 100, so show one decimal place: round(8.18, 1) gives 8.2, so "8.2K". For 9385832, scaled value is 9.385832, which is less than 100, so show one decimal place: round(9.385832, 1) gives 9.4, so "9.4M". For 74581, scaled value is 74.581, which is less than 100, so by that rule, we would show one decimal place: round(74.581, 1) gives 74.6, which is 5 characters ("74.6K"). But the requirement says we want "75K" instead. So maybe the rule is: if rounding to one decimal place yields a string that is 5 characters or more, then round to the nearest integer. But wait, "74.6K" is 5 characters, but "74.5K" is also 5 characters. But the example specifically says "74.5K" is 5 characters, not "74.6K". Possibly they are using a different rounding method: maybe they are rounding to the nearest 10 in the thousands place if the number is 74581. Let's try to understand: 74581 is closer to 75000 than to 74000, so rounding to the nearest 10 thousand gives 75000, and then divided by 1000 gives 75, so "75K". But then what about 8180? 8180 is closer to 8200 than to 8100, so rounding to the nearest hundred gives 8200, divided by 1000 gives 8.2, so "8.2K". And 9385832 is closer to 9400000 than to 9300000, so rounding to the nearest 100000 gives 9400000, divided by 1000000 gives 9.4, so "9.4M". So maybe the rule is: choose the unit such that the scaled value is between 1 and 100, but then round to the nearest 10 if the scaled value is 10 or more? Let's check: For 8180, scaled value is 8.18, which is less than 10, so we want one decimal place. For 9385832, scaled value is 9.385832, which is less than 10, so one decimal place. For 74581, scaled value is 74.581, which is between 10 and 100, so maybe we want to round to the nearest 10? That would yield 75 (if rounding to nearest 10, 74.581 rounds to 75, because 74.581 is closer to 75 than to 74, but wait, rounding to nearest 10 normally means rounding to the nearest multiple of 10, but 74.581 is closer to 75 than to 70? Actually, rounding to nearest 10: 74.581 would round to 75 if we consider tens digit rounding? But normally rounding to nearest 10: 74.581 would round to 75 if we round normally? Let's check: 74.581 is closer to 75 than to 70? Actually, 74.581 - 70 = 4.581, and 75 - 74.581 = 0.419, so yes, it rounds to 75. But then what about numbers like 1234? 1234 / 1000 = 1.234, which is less than 10, so we want one decimal place: round(1.234, 1) gives 1.2, so "1.2K". But what if the scaled value is between 100 and 1000? For example, 1,234,567 is 1,234.567, which is between 100 and 1000, so maybe we want to round to the nearest 10? That would yield 1,235, but then divided by 1000 gives 1.235, but that's 5 characters if we show one decimal place? Let's check: "1.2M" is 4 characters, but "1.235M" is 6 characters. But maybe we want to show no decimal if the scaled value is 100 or more. Let's check: For 1,234,567, scaled value is 1234.567, which is between 100 and 1000, so maybe we want to round to the nearest integer? That would yield 1235, and then "1.2M" if we want to show one significant digit? But then that loses precision. Alternatively, maybe we want to choose the number of significant digits based on the length of the scaled value string. The requirement "The output string should be <= 4 characters if at all possible" means that if we can represent the number in 4 or fewer characters, we should do so. The maximum length allowed is 4 characters. So we want to choose the unit (K, M, B, etc.) and the number of significant digits such that the total length (digits + decimal point if any + suffix) is <= 4. And we want to maximize the number of significant digits while still being within 4 characters. Let's denote scaled = x / (1000**order) where order is chosen such that scaled is between 1 and 1000 maybe? But then the number of digits in scaled (if we show no decimal) is floor(log10(scaled)) + 1. But if we want to show one decimal place, then the string length is floor(log10(scaled)) + 2 (if there's a decimal point and one digit after). But we want to choose the best representation that is <= 4 characters. Let's consider possible orders:

For x < 1000, we simply return str(x) (which is <= 3 digits, so that's fine).

For x >= 1000, we consider orders: K (thousands), M (millions), B (billions), etc. We want to choose the order such that the scaled value is as large as possible while still allowing a representation with <= 4 characters. But the examples: 8180 -> order K, scaled = 8.18, representation "8.2K" is 4 characters. 9385832 -> order M, scaled = 9.385832, representation "9.4M" is 4 characters. 74581 -> order K, scaled = 74.581, representation "74.6K" would be 5 characters if we show one decimal place, so we choose integer rounding: "75K" is 3 characters. But wait, why would we choose integer rounding for 74581? Because if we try to show one decimal place, we get "74.6K" which is 5 characters. But what if we try to show no decimal? That would be "75K" if we round to nearest integer. But then what if the scaled value is less than 10? For 8180, scaled = 8.18, if we show no decimal, that would be "8K", which is 2 characters, but that loses precision. But maybe we want to show one decimal place if it doesn't exceed 4 characters. So the rule might be: if scaled < 10, then show one decimal place. If scaled is between 10 and 100, then check if showing one decimal place would exceed 4 characters. Let's check: if scaled is between 10 and 100, then the number of digits before the decimal is 2. If we add a decimal and one digit after, that's 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 characters exactly. But wait, "74.6K" is 5 characters because 74 is two digits, plus a decimal point, plus 6 is one digit, plus K is one digit, total 5. But if scaled is between 10 and 100, then the number of digits before the decimal is 2, so if we add a decimal and one digit after, that's 2+1+1 = 4 characters. But in our example, 74.581, if we round to one decimal place, we get 74.6, which is 4 characters, not 5. Let's count: "74.6K": digits: '7', '4', '.', '6', 'K' = 5 characters. Wait, I'm counting: "74.6K" has 5 characters. But the requirement says the output string should be <= 4 characters if at all possible. So maybe we want to avoid the decimal point if it causes the string to be 5 characters. Let's recalc: For 8180, scaled = 8.18, if we show one decimal place, that gives "8.2K", which is 4 characters. For 9385832, scaled = 9.385832, one decimal gives "9.4M", which is 4 characters. For 74581, scaled = 74.581, one decimal gives "74.6K", which is 5 characters. But wait, why is "74.6K" 5 characters? Let's count: '7' '4' '.' '6' 'K' = 5. So maybe the rule is: if the scaled value is 10 or greater, then we want to round to the nearest integer instead of showing a decimal point, because that would yield a string with 3 or 4 characters. But then what if the scaled value is less than 10? For 8180, scaled = 8.18, rounding to nearest integer gives "8K", which is 2 characters, but that loses precision. But maybe we want to show one decimal place if it doesn't exceed 4 characters. So the rule might be: if scaled < 10, then show one decimal place; if scaled >= 10, then show no decimal (i.e., round to nearest integer). But let's test: For 8180, scaled = 8.18, which is < 10, so show one decimal: round(8.18, 1) gives 8.2, so "8.2K". For 9385832, scaled = 9.385832, which is < 10, so show one decimal: round(9.385832, 1) gives 9.4, so "9.4M". For 74581, scaled = 74.581, which is >= 10, so show no decimal: round(74.581) gives 75, so "75K". That fits the examples.

But what about numbers that are borderline? For example, if x = 1000 exactly, then scaled = 1.0, which is < 10, so we show one decimal: round(1.0, 1) gives 1.0, so "1.0K". But maybe we want "1K" instead? But the requirement doesn't specify that. It says "roughly represents the number" and "couple significant digits". It might be acceptable to show "1.0K" if it's within 4 characters. But "1.0K" is 4 characters. But maybe we want to drop trailing zeros? The examples don't show that. They show "8.2K" and "9.4M". They don't show "1.0K". But maybe we want to show one decimal if it's less than 10, but if the decimal is .0, we might want to drop it. But the requirement doesn't specify that explicitly. It just says "roughly represents the number" and "couple significant digits". I think it's safe to show one decimal if scaled < 10, but if the decimal part is .0, we might want to show just the integer part. But the examples: 8180 becomes "8.2K", not "8K". So they want one decimal digit if it's less than 10. But what if the scaled value is exactly 10? For example, x = 10000, scaled = 10.0, which is not < 10, so we would show no decimal, so "10K". That is 3 characters, which is fine.

What if x = 9999, scaled = 9.999, which is < 10, so show one decimal: round(9.999, 1) gives 10.0, but then that would be "10.0K", which is 5 characters. But maybe we want to choose a different order in that case? Let's check: 9999 is less than 10000, so order K is appropriate. But if we show one decimal, we get "10.0K" which is 5 characters. But maybe we want to round to the nearest integer in that case? But then "10K" is 3 characters, but that might not be as accurate? But the requirement says "if at all possible" the output string should be <= 4 characters. So if rounding to one decimal would exceed 4 characters, then we should round to the nearest integer. So maybe the rule is: if scaled < 10, then show one decimal, but if rounding to one decimal would produce a string length of 5 or more, then show no decimal. But wait, how do we decide that? Let's consider the length of the string if we show one decimal: Let scaled_rounded = round(scaled, 1). Then convert it to string with one decimal formatting, e.g., format(scaled_rounded, ".1f"). The length of that string (without the suffix) is len(str_val). Then add 1 for the suffix. We want that to be <= 4. So if len(str_val) + 1 <= 4, then we use that representation. Otherwise, use integer rounding: str(int(round(scaled))) and then add suffix. But wait, what if scaled is less than 10? For example, 8180: scaled = 8.18, round to one decimal gives "8.2", length 3, plus suffix "K" gives 4, so that's acceptable. For 9385832: scaled = 9.385832, round to one decimal gives "9.4", length 3, plus suffix "M" gives 4, acceptable. For 74581: scaled = 74.581, round to one decimal gives "74.6", length 4, plus suffix "K" gives 5, so not acceptable, so then use integer rounding: round(74.581) gives 75, length 2, plus suffix "K" gives 3, acceptable. But what about a borderline case: x = 9999, scaled = 9.999, round to one decimal gives "10.0" (because 9.999 rounds to 10.0 with one decimal, I think, because 9.999 rounds to 10.0 if rounding to one decimal, because the hundredths digit is 9, so it rounds up to 10.0). That string "10.0" has length 4, plus suffix "K" gives 5, so then we would use integer rounding: round(9.999) gives 10, string "10", length 2, plus suffix "K" gives 3, so output "10K". But is that acceptable? It might be less precise, but it meets the 4 character limit.

But what if x is such that scaled is between 10 and 100? For example, x = 12345, scaled = 12.345, round to one decimal gives "12.3", length 4, plus suffix "K" gives 5, so then use integer rounding: round(12.345) gives 12, string "12", length 2, plus suffix "K" gives 3, so output "12K". But maybe we want to show one decimal if possible? But the requirement says "if at all possible" the output string should be <= 4 characters. So if one decimal would exceed 4 characters, then we use integer rounding. But wait, what if x = 1234, scaled = 1.234, round to one decimal gives "1.2", length 3, plus suffix "K" gives 4, so that's acceptable. So the rule is: if scaled < 10, use one decimal formatting; if scaled >= 10, then check if formatting with one decimal would yield a string length of 5 or more. But wait, what if scaled is between 10 and 100? Then the number of digits before the decimal is 2. If we add a decimal and one digit after, that's 2+1+1 = 4 characters, which is acceptable. But our example 74581: scaled = 74.581, which is between 10 and 100, so that would normally yield "74.6" which is 4 characters, plus suffix "K" gives 5. So why is that not acceptable? Because the requirement says the output string should be <= 4 characters if at all possible. So maybe the rule is: if the scaled value has more than 2 digits before the decimal, then we should not include a decimal point because that would push the total length over 4. Let's analyze: For scaled value, let integer_part = floor(scaled). The number of digits in integer_part is d = len(str(integer_part)). Then if we want to show one decimal, the total length would be d + 2 (one for the decimal point and one for the decimal digit) plus 1 for the suffix = d + 3. We want d + 3 <= 4, which means d <= 1. So if the integer part has 1 digit, then showing one decimal is acceptable (gives 1+2+1=4). But if the integer part has 2 digits, then showing one decimal gives 2+2+1=5, which is too many. If the integer part has 3 digits, then showing one decimal gives 3+2+1=6, etc. So the rule becomes: if scaled < 10 (i.e., integer part has 1 digit), then show one decimal; otherwise, show no decimal (i.e., round to nearest integer). Let's test: For 8180, scaled = 8.18, integer part is 8 (1 digit), so show one decimal: "8.2K". For 9385832, scaled = 9.385832, integer part is 9 (1 digit), so show one decimal: "9.4M". For 74581, scaled = 74.581, integer part is 74 (2 digits), so show no decimal: round(74.581) gives 75, so "75K". For 9999, scaled = 9.999, integer part is 9 (1 digit), so show one decimal: round(9.999, 1) gives 10.0, but wait, 10.0 has integer part "10" which is 2 digits, but we are formatting with one decimal always if scaled < 10. But 9.999 is actually almost 10, so rounding to one decimal might yield "10.0". But then the integer part "10" has 2 digits, so that would be 2+2+1=5 characters. But wait, but 9.999 is not < 10, it's almost 10. But if we check scaled < 10, then 9.999 < 10 is true, so we would format as one decimal. But then the result "10.0" is 4 characters? Let's count: "10.0" is 4 characters, plus suffix "K" is 5. So that would be 5 characters, which is not allowed. So maybe we need to check: if rounding to one decimal yields a string where the integer part has more than 1 digit, then instead use integer rounding. But what if scaled is exactly 9.5? That would round to 9.5, which is fine because integer part is 9. But if scaled is 9.99, rounding to one decimal gives 10.0, which is not acceptable because integer part becomes "10". So maybe the rule is: if scaled < 10, then check if round(scaled, 1) is less than 10. But if it rounds to 10 or more, then use integer rounding. But what if scaled is 9.95? That rounds to 10.0, which is not acceptable. But maybe we want to show one decimal if possible, but if it causes the integer part to become 10 or more, then we use integer rounding. But what if scaled is 9.95? Then integer part of round(scaled, 1) is 10, which is 2 digits, so then we use integer rounding: round(9.95) gives 10, which is "10", length 2, plus suffix "K" gives 3, so output "10K". But then we lose the decimal precision. But maybe that's acceptable because the requirement is to have <= 4 characters if possible.

Let's test with a few examples:
- x = 2: x < 1000, so just return "2".
- x = 8180: x >= 1000, choose order K because 8180/1000 = 8.18, which is < 100? Actually, we need to choose the order such that the scaled value is between 1 and 100 maybe? But what if x is 1,234,567? Then 1,234,567 / 1000 = 1234.567, which is >= 100, so we want to use M maybe? Let's think: We want the suffix to be K if x < 1,000,000, M if x < 1,000,000,000, etc. But the examples: 9385832 -> "9.4M". So the rule for suffix: if x < 1e3: no suffix, if 1e3 <= x < 1e6: suffix "K", if 1e6 <= x < 1e9: suffix "M", if 1e9 <= x < 1e12: suffix "B", etc. But wait, what about 74581? 74581 is less than 1e6, so suffix "K". And 8180 is less than 1e6, so suffix "K". And 9385832 is less than 1e9, so suffix "M". That seems to be the pattern.

So algorithm:
def abbrev_num(x):
    if x < 1000:
         return str(x)
    # Determine suffix and factor
    suffixes = ["K", "M", "B", "T"]  # maybe extend if needed
    factor = 1000
    order = 0
    while x >= 1000 and order < len(suffixes):
         x /= 1000.0
         order += 1
    # Now x is the scaled value.
    # Decide formatting: if scaled value < 10, then try one decimal formatting, but check if rounding to one decimal yields integer part length > 1.
    scaled = x  # already scaled
    # Option 1: one decimal formatting
    one_decimal = format(scaled, ".1f")
    # But if the integer part of one_decimal (i.e., before the decimal point) has more than 1 digit, then that representation would be too long.
    # Let's check: if one_decimal[0] is digit, then integer part is one_decimal.split('.')[0]. But careful: if one_decimal is something like "10.0", then integer part is "10", which has length 2.
    int_part = one_decimal.split('.')[0]
    if len(int_part) == 1:
         # then one decimal representation is acceptable if total length (len(one_decimal) + 1 for suffix) <= 4.
         rep = one_decimal + suffixes[order-1]  # order-1 because order is 1-indexed for suffixes? Actually, if order==1, suffixes[0] is "K".
         if len(rep) <= 4:
              return rep
         else:
              # fallback to integer rounding
              rep_int = str(int(round(scaled)))
              return rep_int + suffixes[order-1]
    else:
         # integer rounding representation
         rep_int = str(int(round(scaled)))
         return rep_int + suffixes[order-1]

But wait, what if scaled is exactly 9.95, then one_decimal = "10.0", int_part = "10", length 2, so we go to else, and then rep_int = str(int(round(9.95))) = "10", so output "10K". That is acceptable.

But what if scaled is 8.2, then one_decimal = "8.2", int_part = "8", length 1, so we use that, output "8.2K". That fits.

But what if scaled is 74.581, then one_decimal = "74.6", int_part = "74", length 2, so we use integer rounding, which gives "75K". That fits.

But what if scaled is 1.234, then one_decimal = "1.2", int_part = "1", so output "1.2K". That is 4 characters, acceptable.

But what if scaled is 9.999, then one_decimal = "10.0", int_part = "10", length 2, so we use integer rounding, which gives "10K". That is 3 characters, acceptable.

But what if scaled is 0. something? That won't happen because x is an integer and if x < 1000, we already returned x.

But what if x is exactly 1000? Then while loop: x becomes 1.0, order becomes 1, suffix "K". Then scaled = 1.0, one_decimal = "1.0", int_part = "1", length 1, so output "1.0K". That is 4 characters. But maybe we want "1K" instead? The requirement doesn't specify that trailing zero after decimal should be dropped. But maybe we want to drop trailing zeros if they are not significant? The examples don't show that. They show "8.2K" and "9.4M". They don't show "1.0K". But maybe it's acceptable.

Alternatively, we could check if the formatted string ends with ".0" and then remove it. But the requirement says "roughly represents the number" and "couple significant digits". It might be more aesthetically pleasing to drop the trailing zero if it's not needed. But the examples don't show that explicitly. However, the example "2 => 2" suggests that if the number is an integer and doesn't need a decimal, we just output the integer. For consistency, maybe we want to drop trailing zeros in the decimal representation if they are not needed. But then "8.2K" is fine, "9.4M" is fine, "1.0K" would become "1K", which is 2 characters, which is even better. But then what about a case like 1.23? That would become "1.2K" if we drop the trailing zero? But then we lose one significant digit. But the requirement says "a couple significant digits", so maybe 1 significant digit is enough if it's less than 10? But the examples: 8180 becomes "8.2K", which is 2 significant digits. 9385832 becomes "9.4M", which is 2 significant digits. 74581 becomes "75K", which is 2 significant digits. So maybe the rule is: if scaled < 10, show one decimal digit, but if that one decimal digit is .0, then drop it. But then what if scaled is 1.0 exactly? Then we want "1K", not "1.0K". But then what if scaled is 1.23? Then one decimal digit rounding gives "1.2", which is fine. But what if scaled is 1.235? Then one decimal digit rounding gives "1.2" (if rounding normally, 1.235 rounds to 1.2 because the next digit is 5? Actually, 1.235 rounds to 1.2 if rounding to one decimal place? Let's check: 1.235, the hundredths digit is 3, so it rounds down to 1.2, but if we wanted two significant digits, maybe we want "1.2" anyway. But then we are not using two significant digits, we are using one decimal place. But the requirement says "a couple significant digits", which might imply 2 significant digits if possible. But then for numbers less than
