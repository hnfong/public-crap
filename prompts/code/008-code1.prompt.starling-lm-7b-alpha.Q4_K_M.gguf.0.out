Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Here are the two sorting algorithms you requested:

Bubble Sort:
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1] :
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
```

Merge Sort:
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left_half = arr[:mid]
        right_half = arr[mid:]

        merge_sort(left_half)
        merge_sort(right_half)

        i = j = k = 0

        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
                arr[k] = left_half[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right_half[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        while i < len(left_half):
            arr[k] = left_half[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1

        while j < len(right_half):
            arr[k] = right_half[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
```

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2) in the worst case, where n is the number of items being sorted.

Merge sort, on the other hand, is a divide and conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, recursively calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves. The time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n) in the worst case, which is much better than bubble sort for large lists.

In summary, while bubble sort is simpler to implement, merge sort is more efficient for larger lists.
