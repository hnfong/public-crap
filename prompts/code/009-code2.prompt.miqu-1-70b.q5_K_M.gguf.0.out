 Performing a binary search on a file directly, without loading the entire file into memory, can be done by reading and comparing only a few lines at a time. This approach is useful when dealing with large files that cannot fit into memory. Here's a step-by-step process to perform binary search on a file:

1. Open the file in read mode.
2. Initialize the start and end pointers to the first and last line numbers, respectively.
3. Calculate the middle index using the formula: `mid = (start + end) // 2`.
4. Read the line at the middle index and compare it with the target value.
5. If the target value is equal to the middle value, return the index.
6. If the target value is less than the middle value, update the end pointer to `mid - 1` and repeat steps 3-6.
7. If the target value is greater than the middle value, update the start pointer to `mid + 1` and repeat steps 3-6.
8. If the target value is not found and the start pointer is greater than the end pointer, return the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

Here's a Python function that implements the above steps:

```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        start = 0
        end = 0
        while True:
            end += 1
            file.seek(0, 2)  # Move the file pointer to the end of the file
            current_size = file.tell()  # Get the current size of the file
            file.seek(max(0, current_size - (current_size // 2 ** end)))  # Move the file pointer to the middle of the file
            line = file.readline().strip()
            if not line:
                break

        mid = 0
        while start < end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            file.seek(max(0, (current_size - (current_size // 2 ** mid))))
            line = file.readline().strip()
            if line == target:
                return mid
            elif line < target:
                start = mid + 1
            else:
                end = mid

        return bisect.bisect_left(list(range(start, end)), target) if start <= end else None
```

This function uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the insertion point when the target value is not found. Note that this function assumes the input file is sorted lexicographically.

The time complexity of this function is O(log(n)), where n is the number of lines in the file. This is because the binary search algorithm reduces the search space by half in each iteration, resulting in logarithmic time complexity. [end of text]
