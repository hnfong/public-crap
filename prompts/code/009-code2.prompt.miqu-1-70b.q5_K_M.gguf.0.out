Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a file directly, we can use a similar approach to binary search on an in-memory list, but we need to modify it to handle the file I/O operations. Here is how we can do it:

1. Open the file and remember the current position.
2. Seek to the middle of the file and read a line.
3. Compare the target with the line read.
   - If the target is less than the line, seek to the middle of the first half of the file and continue the binary search in the first half.
   - If the target is greater than the line, seek to the middle of the second half of the file and continue the binary search in the second half.
   - If the target is equal to the line, return the current position.
4. If the target is not found and the size of the search space is 1, return the current position as the insertion point.

Here is a Python function that implements the above algorithm:

```python
import bisect
import os

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        length = os.path.getsize(file_path)
        start = 0
        end = length
        while start < end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            f.seek(mid)
            line = f.readline().strip()
            if not line:
                return bisect.bisect_left(f, target)
            if line < target:
                start = mid + 1
            elif line > target:
                end = mid
            else:
                return mid
        return bisect.bisect_left(f, target)
```

Note that this function uses the `bisect` module to find the insertion point when the target is not found. The `bisect_left` function returns the insertion point such that all elements before it are less than or equal to the target, and all elements after it are greater than the target.

Also, note that the time complexity of this algorithm is O(log(n)) because each iteration reduces the search space by half, and the file I/O operations do not affect the time complexity because the number of disk accesses is proportional to the number of iterations.
