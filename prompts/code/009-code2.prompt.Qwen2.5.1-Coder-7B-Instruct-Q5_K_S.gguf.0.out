Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a text file where the lines are sorted in lexicographical order, we need to adapt the traditional binary search algorithm to work with file I/O operations. The key is to read only the necessary parts of the file, rather than loading the entire file into memory. This allows us to achieve the desired O(log(n)) complexity.

Here's a step-by-step explanation and the implementation of the `binary_search_file` function:

1. **Open the File**: We open the file in read mode.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - Calculate the middle index of the current range of lines.
   - Read the middle line from the file.
   - Compare the middle line with the target.
   - Adjust the search range based on the comparison:
     - If the middle line is equal to the target, return the middle index.
     - If the middle line is less than the target, move the lower bound up.
     - If the middle line is greater than the target, move the upper bound down.

3. **Handle Edge Cases**: If the target is not found, return the insertion point, which is the position where the target would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

Here's the implementation of the `binary_search_file` function:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        low = 0
        high = len(file) - 1
        
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            file.seek(0)
            for _ in range(mid):
                file.readline()
            mid_line = file.readline().strip()
            
            if mid_line == target:
                return mid
            elif mid_line < target:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        
        return low

# Example usage:
# Assuming 'sorted_names.txt' is a file with names sorted lexicographically
# print(binary_search_file('sorted_names.txt', 'Alice'))
```

### Explanation:
- **File Reading**: We use `file.seek(0)` to reset the file pointer to the beginning of the file and `file.readline()` to read lines one by one. This is efficient because it avoids loading the entire file into memory.
- **Loop**: The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, which indicates that the target is not present in the file.
- **Insertion Point**: If the target is not found, the function returns `low`, which is the correct insertion point for the target.

This approach ensures that we perform the binary search directly on the file, maintaining the O(log(n)) complexity while keeping memory usage minimal. [end of text]
