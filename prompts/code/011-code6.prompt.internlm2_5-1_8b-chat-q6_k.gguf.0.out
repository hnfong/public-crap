Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

The program you've provided is a simple program that uses a while loop to increment a variable `x` by a constant `inc` until `x` is greater than or equal to infinity. However, the program does not have any logic to handle inputs other than infinity. 

In Python, the `math.inf` constant represents infinity. If you run the program with any non-infinity value for `inc`, the program will always print "Done" because the loop will never terminate.

Here are two examples of inputs that will lead to the output "Done":

1. Inputting a non-infinity value for `inc`:

```
Enter a number: 1.0
```

In this case, the program will increment `x` by 1.0 and then print "Done".

2. Inputting a negative value for `inc`:

```
Enter a number: -1.0
```

In this case, the program will decrement `x` by 1.0 and then print "Done". [end of text]
