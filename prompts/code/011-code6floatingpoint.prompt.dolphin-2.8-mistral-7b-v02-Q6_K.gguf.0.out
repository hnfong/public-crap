Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

---

Remember to answer all the questions

Q1.
 
<|im_start|> assistant
The eventual output of the first program is `inf` (infinity). This is because the program is continuously adding 1.0 to x, which will eventually cause x to become greater than any finite number and approach infinity.

Q2.

The eventual output of the second program is also `inf`. This is because the program is continuously multiplying x by 1.001, which will cause x to approach infinity.

Q3.

Yes, there are inputs that will lead to the output "Done". For example, if the input is 1.0, the program will increment x by 1.0 each time, and when x becomes greater than any finite number, the program will reach the condition `x < math.inf` and print "Done". Another example is if the input is 0.1, the program will increment x by 0.1 each time, and when x becomes greater than any finite number, the program will reach the condition `x < math.inf` and print "Done".
