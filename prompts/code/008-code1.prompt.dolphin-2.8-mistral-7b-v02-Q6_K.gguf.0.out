Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Sure, here's a simple implementation of the bubble sort and merge sort in Python:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    # Traverse through all array elements
    for i in range(n):

        # Last i elements are already in place
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):

            # traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1
            # Swap if the element found is greater
            # than the next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1] :
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

# Testing the function
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]

bubble_sort(arr)

print ("Sorted array is:")
for i in range(len(arr)):
    print ("%d" %arr[i])
```

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:

        # Finding the mid of the array
        mid = len(arr) // 2

        # Dividing the array elements
        L = arr[:mid]

        # into 2 halves
        R = arr[mid:]

        merge_sort(L)

        merge_sort(R)


        i = j = k = 0

        # Copy data to temp arrays L[] and R[]
        while i < len(L) and j < len(R):
            if L[i] < R[j]:
                arr[k] = L[i]
                i+=1
            else:
                arr[k] = R[j]
                j+=1
            k+=1

        # Checking if any element was left
        while i < len(L):
            arr[k] = L[i]
            i+=1
            k+=1

        while j < len(R):
            arr[k] = R[j]
            j+=1
            k+=1

# Testing the function
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]

merge_sort(arr)

print ("Sorted array is:")
for i in range(len(arr)):
    print ("%d" %arr[i])
```

Bubble Sort:
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order. It is an in-place comparison-based algorithm. Bubble sort has a worst-case and average complexity of O(n^2) where n is the number of items being sorted. Bubble sort is not a suitable choice for large data sets, but it is useful for small data sets and teaching purposes.

Merge Sort:
Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the unsorted list into N sublists, each containing one element, and then repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. The algorithm's worst-case time complexity is O(n log n), where n is the number of items being sorted. Merge Sort is an efficient, stable sorting algorithm and is suitable for large data sets.

Comparison:
- Time Complexity: Bubble Sort has a worst-case and average complexity of O(n^2), while Merge Sort has a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n).
- Space Complexity: Both algorithms have O(n) space complexity, since they require extra space to store the temporary values.
- Stability: Merge Sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that the relative order of equal elements is preserved. Bubble Sort is not stable.
- Efficiency: Bubble Sort is not efficient for large data sets, while Merge Sort is efficient for large data sets.
- In-place: Bubble Sort is an in-place algorithm, meaning that it does not require additional memory space. Merge Sort is not an in-place algorithm, as it requires additional space to store the temporary values.<|im_end|>
