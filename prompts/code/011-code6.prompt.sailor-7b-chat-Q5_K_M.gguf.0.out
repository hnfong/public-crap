Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Yes, if you enter the following values for `inc` (input) the output will be "Done": 
1. inc = 2.0
2. inc = 3.14159
3. inc = 9.80665<|im_end|>
