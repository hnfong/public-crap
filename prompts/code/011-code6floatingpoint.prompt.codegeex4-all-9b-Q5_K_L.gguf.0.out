Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Remember to answer all the questions

Q1.

Q1. The program will eventually output `inf` (infinity). This is because the `while` loop will continue to increment `x` by `1.0` indefinitely, and since `1.0` is a finite number, `x` will never reach infinity. However, the `while` loop will eventually terminate when `x` becomes too large to be represented as a floating point number, and Python will return `inf` to indicate that the value is too large.

Q2. The program will eventually output `inf` (infinity). This is because the `while` loop will continue to multiply `x` by `1.001` indefinitely, and since `1.001` is a finite number, `x` will never reach infinity. However, the `while` loop will eventually terminate when `x` becomes too large to be represented as a floating point number, and Python will return `inf` to indicate that the value is too large. The results are the same as the results above because the increment or multiplication factor is still a finite number.

Q3. Yes, there are inputs that will lead to the output "Done". For example, if the user enters `0.0`, the `while` loop will never execute because `x` is already equal to `0.0`. Another example is if the user enters a very small number, such as `1e-300`, the `while` loop will execute a very large number of times before `x` becomes too large to be represented as a floating point number, and the program will output "Done". However, if the user enters a number that is too large, such as `1e300`, the `while` loop will never terminate because `x` will become too large to be represented as a floating point number, and the program will not output "Done".
