Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a sorted text file, we need to read the file line by line and maintain a sorted list of names. This way, we can use binary search on the list of names. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Read the file line by line.
2. Maintain a sorted list of names.
3. Use binary search to find the target name.

Here's the Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    # Helper function to perform binary search on the sorted list of names
    def binary_search(sorted_names, target):
        left, right = 0, len(sorted_names) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if sorted_names[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif sorted_names[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return left

    # Read the file and initialize the sorted list of names
    sorted_names = []
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            name = line.strip()
            sorted_names.append(name)
            sorted_names.sort()  # Maintain the sorted order

    # Perform binary search
    return binary_search(sorted_names, target)

# Example usage
file_path = 'sorted_names.txt'
target = 'John'
position = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
print(f"The target '{target}' is at position {position} in the sorted list.")
```

### Explanation:
1. **Binary Search Helper Function**: The `binary_search` function is a standard binary search algorithm that works on a sorted list. It returns the index of the target if found, or the insertion point if the target is not found.
2. **Reading and Sorting**: The file is read line by line, and each line is stripped to remove any leading or trailing whitespace. The names are appended to the `sorted_names` list, and the list is sorted after each insertion to maintain the sorted order.
3. **Binary Search on Sorted List**: The `binary_search` function is called with the sorted list of names and the target name. It returns the index where the target should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

### Note:
- The file is read and processed in a single pass, which is efficient for large files.
- The file is read line by line, and each line is processed to maintain the sorted order. This ensures that the list of names remains sorted throughout the process.
- The binary search is performed on the sorted list of names, which allows us to find the target in O(log(n)) time.

This approach ensures that we can perform a binary search on the sorted names in the file efficiently. [end of text]
