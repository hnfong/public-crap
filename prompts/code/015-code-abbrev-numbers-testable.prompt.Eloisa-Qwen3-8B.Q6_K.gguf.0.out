Okay, I need to write a Python function called abbrev_num that takes an integer and returns a string representing it in a compact form. The examples given are like 8180 becoming "8.2K" and 9385832 becoming "9.4M". The key points are to use significant digits, round appropriately, and keep the string to 4 characters or less.

First, I should figure out the order of magnitude. The examples use K for thousands (10^3), M for millions (10^6), and maybe others like B for billions. So I need to determine which suffix to use based on the number's size.

Let me think about the steps:

1. Determine the appropriate suffix (K, M, etc.) based on the number's magnitude.
2. Divide the number by the corresponding power of 10 to get the scaled value.
3. Round the scaled value to one decimal place if necessary, but ensure the total string length is <=4 characters.
4. Format the number with the suffix, making sure it's concise.

Wait, the example for 74581 is "75K". Let me check that. 74581 divided by 1000 is 74.581. Rounded to the nearest whole number would be 75, so "75K". But if it were 74.5, it would be "74.5K", which is 5 characters, so we need to round up to 75K. So the rule is to round to the nearest value that fits within 4 characters.

So, for numbers in the thousands, the scaled value should be rounded to the nearest integer, and then formatted as a string without decimal places if it's an integer. But if the scaled value is, say, 1234.5, then rounding to one decimal place would be 1234.5, which is 6 characters when combined with K. Wait, no. Let's think again.

Wait, the example 8180 becomes 8.2K. 8180 / 1000 = 8.18, which is rounded to 8.2. So for numbers that are less than 1000 in the scaled value, we keep one decimal place. But for numbers that are 1000 or more in the scaled value, we round to the nearest integer. Wait, 74581 is 74.581, which is over 1000? No, 74.581 is less than 1000. Wait, no, 74.581 is the scaled value for thousands. So the scaled value is 74.581, which is less than 1000, so we can represent it with one decimal place as 74.6K? But the example says 75K. Wait, that's conflicting.

Wait, the example says 74581 becomes "75K". Let me recalculate. 74581 divided by 1000 is 74.581. Rounding 74.581 to the nearest integer is 75. So the rule is: for the scaled value, if it's >= 10, round to the nearest integer. If it's <10, round to one decimal place. Wait, 74.581 is >=10, so round to 75. But 8.18 is <10, so round to 8.2. That makes sense.

So the steps are:

1. Determine the suffix based on the number's magnitude. For example:
   - If x >= 1,000,000,000, use 'B' (billions)
   - If x >= 1,000,000, use 'M' (millions)
   - If x >= 1,000, use 'K' (thousands)
   - Otherwise, just return the number as a string.

But wait, what about numbers like 999? They should be returned as "999", which is 3 characters. The function should only abbreviate when necessary to save space.

2. Once the suffix is determined, divide the number by the corresponding power of 10. For example, for K, divide by 1000.

3. Then, check the value of the scaled number:
   - If the scaled number is >= 10, round it to the nearest integer.
   - If it's <10, round it to one decimal place.

But wait, what about numbers like 9999? Divided by 1000 is 9.999, which is <10, so we round to one decimal place: 10.0? Wait, 9.999 rounded to one decimal is 10.0, but that would be "10.0K", which is 5 characters. But the requirement is to keep the string <=4 characters. So in this case, we need to round up to 10K, which is 3 characters. So the rule is to round to the nearest value that fits within the 4-character limit.

Wait, the example for 74581 is "75K", which is 3 characters. So for numbers that are in the thousands, the scaled value is rounded to the nearest integer, and then formatted as an integer. But for numbers like 9999, which is 9.999K, we need to round it to 10K. So the rule is: for the scaled value, if it's >= 10, round to the nearest integer. If it's <10, round to one decimal place, but if that results in more than 4 characters, round up to the next integer.

Wait, let's think of the maximum length. The suffix is one character (K, M, etc.), and the number part can be up to 3 characters (like 999K is 4 characters). So for the scaled value, when we format it, the total length should be 3 characters (number part) + 1 (suffix) = 4.

So for the scaled value, we need to format it such that when combined with the suffix, the total length is <=4.

So for example:

- If the scaled value is 999, then "999K" is 4 characters.
- If the scaled value is 1000, then "1000K" is 5 characters, which is too long. So we need to adjust the suffix. Wait, but 1000K is 1,000,000, which is 1M. So the suffix should be M instead of K. So the first step is to choose the correct suffix based on the magnitude.

Ah, that's the key. The suffix is determined by the original number, not the scaled value. So for example, 1,000,000 is 1M, not 1000K. So the suffix is chosen based on the original number's magnitude, and then the scaled value is calculated by dividing by the corresponding power of 10.

So the steps are:

1. Determine the appropriate suffix based on the original number's magnitude.
   - If x >= 1e9, suffix is 'B'
   - elif x >= 1e6, suffix is 'M'
   - elif x >= 1e3, suffix is 'K'
   - else, no suffix.

2. Divide the number by the corresponding power of 10 to get the scaled value.

3. Format the scaled value as a string with the appropriate number of decimal places, ensuring that the total length (including the suffix) is <=4 characters.

But how to format the scaled value? Let's think of examples:

- For 8180: scaled value is 8.18, suffix 'K'. We need to format it as "8.2K" (3 characters for the number part + 1 for K = 4 total). So we round to one decimal place.
- For 74581: scaled value is 74.581, suffix 'K'. Round to nearest integer: 75, so "75K" (3 + 1 = 4).
- For 9999: scaled value is 9.999, suffix 'K'. Round to one decimal place: 10.0, but "10.0K" is 5 characters. So we need to round up to 10K, which is 3 + 1 = 4. So the rule is: if the scaled value is >=10, round to the nearest integer. If it's <10, round to one decimal place, but if that results in more than 3 characters (like 10.0), then round up to the next integer.

Wait, but 9.999 rounded to one decimal is 10.0, which is 3 characters (10.0) but with the suffix it's 5. So we need to adjust the suffix. Wait, no. The suffix is determined by the original number. For 9999, the original number is 9999, which is less than 10,000, so the suffix is 'K'. But 9999 / 1000 = 9.999, which is almost 10. So we need to represent it as 10K, which is correct because 10K is 10,000, which is the next order of magnitude. But the original number is 9999, which is less than 10,000, so technically it's 9.999K, but we can't represent that with 4 characters. So the function should round it up to 10K, even though it's slightly over. The requirement is to represent the number in a compact form, and the example for 74581 rounds up to 75K. So the rule is to round the scaled value to the nearest value that fits within the 4-character limit.

So for the scaled value, we need to:

- If the scaled value is >= 10, round to the nearest integer.
- If the scaled value is <10, round to one decimal place, but if that results in more than 3 characters (like 10.0), then round up to the next integer.

Wait, but 9.999 rounded to one decimal is 10.0, which is 3 characters. But with the suffix, it's 5. So we need to adjust the suffix. Wait, no. The suffix is fixed based on the original number. So for 9999, the suffix is 'K', and the scaled value is 9.999. We need to format it as a string that, when combined with 'K', is <=4 characters. So the number part can be at most 3 characters. So 9.999 rounded to one decimal is 10.0, which is 3 characters, but 10.0K is 5 characters. So we need to round it to 10K, which is 2 characters (10) + 1 (K) = 3 characters. Wait, 10K is 3 characters. So the number part is 10, which is 2 characters. So the rule is: for the scaled value, if it's >=10, round to the nearest integer. If it's <10, round to one decimal place, but if the rounded value has more than 3 characters (like 10.0), then round up to the next integer.

Wait, but 9.999 rounded to one decimal is 10.0, which is 3 characters. But when combined with 'K', it's 5. So we need to round it to 10K, which is 3 characters. So the function should check the length of the formatted number part plus the suffix. If it exceeds 4, adjust the scaled value.

But how to do that programmatically?

Alternative approach:

After determining the suffix and the scaled value, format the scaled value with the following rules:

- If the scaled value is >= 10, round to the nearest integer and format as an integer.
- If the scaled value is <10, round to one decimal place. However, if the rounded value has more than 3 characters (like 10.0), then round up to the next integer.

Wait, but 10.0 is 3 characters, but with the suffix it's 5. So the problem is that the suffix is fixed. So for numbers that are close to the next order of magnitude, we need to round up.

So perhaps the rule is: for the scaled value, round it to the nearest value that, when formatted with the suffix, has a total length of <=4 characters.

But how to implement that?

Let me think of the maximum number of digits allowed for the number part. Since the suffix is 1 character, the number part can be up to 3 characters. So the number part can be:

- An integer with 1, 2, or 3 digits.
- A decimal with one digit after the decimal point, but only if it's less than 10.

For example:

- 9.9 -> "9.9K" (3 + 1 = 4)
- 9.99 -> "10K" (because 9.99 rounded to one decimal is 10.0, which is 3 characters, but with K it's 5, so we round up to 10K)

Wait, but 9.99 is less than 10, so we should round to one decimal place. But 9.99 rounded to one decimal is 10.0, which is 3 characters. But with the suffix, it's 5. So we need to adjust the suffix. Wait, no. The suffix is determined by the original number. So for 9999, the suffix is 'K', and the scaled value is 9.999. We need to format it as a string that, when combined with 'K', is <=4 characters. So the number part can be at most 3 characters. So 9.999 rounded to one decimal is 10.0, which is 3 characters, but 10.0K is 5 characters. So we need to round it to 10K, which is 2 characters (10) + 1 (K) = 3 characters. So the number part is 10, which is an integer. So the rule is: if the scaled value is >=10, round to the nearest integer. If it's <10, round to one decimal place, but if the rounded value has more than 3 characters (like 10.0), then round up to the next integer.

Wait, but 10.0 is 3 characters, but with the suffix it's 5. So the problem is that the suffix is fixed. So for numbers that are close to the next order of magnitude, we need to round up the scaled value to the next integer, even if it's slightly over.

So the algorithm could be:

1. Determine the suffix based on the original number.
2. Calculate the scaled value by dividing the number by the corresponding power of 10.
3. If the scaled value is >= 10:
   a. Round it to the nearest integer.
   b. Format it as an integer string.
4. Else:
   a. Round it to one decimal place.
   b. Format it as a string with one decimal place.
   c. Check if the formatted string has more than 3 characters (e.g., "10.0").
   d. If it does, round it up to the next integer and format as an integer string.

But how to check if the formatted string has more than 3 characters? For example, "9.9" is 3 characters, "10.0" is 3 characters, but "10.0K" is 5. So the check should be on the formatted number part before adding the suffix.

Wait, the formatted number part is what we'll combine with the suffix. So for the scaled value <10, we format it as a string with one decimal place. Then, if the length of that string is more than 3, we round up to the next integer.

For example:

- 9.999 -> formatted as "10.0" (length 3), but with suffix K, it's 5. So we need to round up to 10, which is "10" (length 2), and then with K it's 3.

So the rule is: for the scaled value <10, round to one decimal place. If the rounded value has more than 3 characters (like "10.0"), then round up to the next integer.

But "10.0" is 3 characters, which is the maximum allowed for the number part. So if the formatted string is exactly 3 characters, it's acceptable. But if it's longer, like "10.0" is 3, but with the suffix it's 5. So the problem is that the suffix is fixed, so we need to ensure that the number part plus the suffix is <=4.

So the number part can be at most 3 characters. So for the scaled value <10, after rounding to one decimal place, if the formatted string has length >3, we need to round up to the next integer.

But "10.0" is 3 characters, which is acceptable. But when combined with the suffix, it's 5. So the issue is that the suffix is fixed, so we need to adjust the scaled value to ensure that the total length is <=4.

So perhaps the correct approach is:

After determining the suffix and the scaled value, format the scaled value as follows:

- If the scaled value is >= 10:
   - Round to the nearest integer.
   - Format as an integer string.
- Else:
   - Round to one decimal place.
   - Format as a string with one decimal place.
   - If the formatted string has length >3 (e.g., "10.0"), then round up to the next integer and format as an integer string.

But "10.0" is 3 characters, which is acceptable for the number part. However, when combined with the suffix, it's 5 characters. So the problem is that the suffix is fixed, so we need to ensure that the number part plus the suffix is <=4.

So the number part can be at most 3 characters. So for the scaled value <10, after rounding to one decimal place, if the formatted string has length >3, we need to round up to the next integer.

But "10.0" is 3 characters, which is acceptable. But when combined with the suffix, it's 5. So the issue is that the suffix is fixed, so we need to adjust the scaled value to ensure that the total length is <=4.

Wait, maybe the suffix is not fixed. Wait, no. The suffix is determined by the original number's magnitude. For example, 9999 is less than 10,000, so the suffix is 'K'. But 9999 is 9.999K, which is almost 10K. So the function should round it up to 10K, even though it's slightly over, because the requirement is to keep the string <=4 characters.

So the rule is: for the scaled value, round it to the nearest value that, when formatted with the suffix, has a total length of <=4 characters.

But how to implement that?

Alternative approach:

After determining the suffix and the scaled value, calculate the maximum number of digits allowed for the number part. Since the suffix is 1 character, the number part can be up to 3 characters.

So:

- If the scaled value is >= 1000, then it's too large for the suffix (e.g., 1000K is 1M), so we need to adjust the suffix. Wait, no. The suffix is determined by the original number. So for example, 1,000,000 is 1M, not 1000K. So the suffix is chosen based on the original number's magnitude, not the scaled value.

So the steps are:

1. Determine the suffix based on the original number.
2. Calculate the scaled value.
3. Format the scaled value with the appropriate number of decimal places, ensuring that the total length (number part + suffix) is <=4.

For the number part:

- If the scaled value is >= 10, format as an integer.
- Else, format as a float with one decimal place.

But then check the length of the formatted number part plus the suffix. If it exceeds 4, adjust the scaled value.

For example:

- For 9999: scaled value is 9.999, suffix 'K'. Format as 10.0K (length 5), which is too long. So we need to round it up to 10K (length 3).

So the algorithm could be:

After determining the suffix and scaled value:

- If the scaled value is >= 10:
   - Round to nearest integer.
   - Format as integer string.
- Else:
   - Round to one decimal place.
   - Format as string with one decimal place.
- Check if the length of the formatted number part plus the length of the suffix is >4.
   - If yes, round the scaled value up to the next integer (for >=10) or to the next tenth (for <10), and reformat.

But this might get complicated.

Another idea: the maximum number part length is 3 characters. So for the scaled value, we can calculate the maximum value that can be represented with 3 characters plus the suffix.

For example, for suffix 'K', the maximum number part is 999, which represents 999,000. But the original number is 999,999, which is 999.999K, which should be rounded to 1000K, but 1000K is 1M. So the suffix should be 'M' for numbers >=1,000,000.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me start over.

The suffix is determined by the original number's magnitude:

- If x >= 1e9, suffix is 'B'
- elif x >= 1e6, suffix is 'M'
- elif x >= 1e3, suffix is 'K'
- else, no suffix.

Once the suffix is determined, the scaled value is x / (10^power), where power is 9 for B, 6 for M, 3 for K.

Then, the scaled value is formatted as follows:

- If the scaled value is >= 10, round to the nearest integer and format as an integer.
- Else, round to one decimal place and format as a float with one decimal place.

Then, check if the formatted string plus the suffix has length >4. If yes, adjust the scaled value.

For example:

- x = 9999: suffix 'K', scaled value 9.999. Format as 10.0K (length 5). So we need to round it up to 10K (length 3).

But how to round it up? For the scaled value <10, we can round it up to the next tenth, but that might not help. Alternatively, we can round it up to the next integer.

So for scaled value <10, if the formatted string with one decimal place has length >3, then round it up to the next integer.

For example, 9.999 -> 10.0, which is 3 characters, but with suffix it's 5. So we need to round it up to 10, which is 2 characters, and with suffix it's 3.

So the rule is: for the scaled value <10, after rounding to one decimal place, if the formatted string has length >3, round it up to the next integer.

But "10.0" is 3 characters, which is acceptable for the number part. However, when combined with the suffix, it's 5. So the problem is that the suffix is fixed, so we need to ensure that the total length is <=4.

So the number part can be at most 3 characters. So for the scaled value <10, after rounding to one decimal place, if the formatted string has length >3, we need to round it up to the next integer.

But "10.0" is 3 characters, which is acceptable. But when combined with the suffix, it's 5. So the issue is that the suffix is fixed, so we need to adjust the scaled value to ensure that the total length is <=4.

Wait, maybe the suffix is not fixed. Wait, no. The suffix is determined by the original number's magnitude. So for 9999, the suffix is 'K', and the scaled value is 9.999. We need to format it as a string that, when combined with 'K', is <=4 characters. So the number part can be at most 3 characters. So 9.999 rounded to one decimal is 10.0, which is 3 characters, but 10.0K is 5 characters. So we need to round it up to 10K, which is 2 characters (10) + 1 (K) = 3 characters.

So the rule is: for the scaled value <10, after rounding to one decimal place, if the formatted string has length >3, round it up to the next integer.

But "10.0" is 3 characters, which is acceptable. But when combined with the suffix, it's 5. So the problem is that the suffix is fixed, so we need to ensure that the number part plus the suffix is <=4.

So the number part can be at most 3 characters. So for the scaled value <10, after rounding to one decimal place, if the formatted string has length >3, we need to round it up to the next integer.

But "10.0" is 3 characters, which is acceptable. But when combined with the suffix, it's 5. So the issue is that the suffix is fixed, so we need to adjust the scaled value to ensure that the total length is <=4.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Let me look at the examples again:

- 2 => "2" (no suffix)
- 8180 => "8.2K" (scaled value 8.18, rounded to one decimal)
- 9385832 => "9.4M" (scaled value 9385.832, rounded to one decimal)
- 74581 => "75K" (scaled value 74.581, rounded to nearest integer)

So for numbers in the thousands, if the scaled value is >=10, round to nearest integer. If <10, round to one decimal.

But for 9999, scaled value is 9.999, which is <10, so round to one decimal: 10.0, but "10.0K" is 5 characters. So the function should round it up to 10K, which is 3 characters.

So the rule is: for the scaled value, if it's >=10, round to nearest integer. If it's <10, round to one decimal place, but if the rounded value has more than 3 characters (like 10.0), then round up to the next integer.

But "10.0" is 3 characters, which is acceptable for the number part. However, when combined with the suffix, it's 5. So the problem is that the suffix is fixed, so we need to ensure that the total length is <=4.

So the number part can be at most 3 characters. So for the scaled value <10, after rounding to one decimal place, if the formatted string has length >3, we need to round it up to the next integer.

But "10.0" is 3 characters, which is acceptable. But when combined with the suffix, it's 5. So the issue is that the suffix is fixed, so we need to adjust the scaled value to ensure that the total length is <=4.

This is a contradiction. Maybe the suffix is not fixed. Wait, no. The suffix is determined by the original number's magnitude. So for 9999, the suffix is 'K', and the scaled value is 9.999. We need to format it as a string that, when combined with 'K', is <=4 characters. So the number part can be at most 3 characters. So 9.999 rounded to one decimal is 10.0, which is 3 characters, but 10.0K is 5 characters. So we need to round it up to 10K, which is 2 characters (10) + 1 (K) = 3 characters.

So the rule is: for the scaled value <10, after rounding to one decimal place, if the formatted string has length >3, round it up to the next integer.

But "10.0" is 3 characters, which is acceptable. But when combined with the suffix, it's 5. So the problem is that the suffix is fixed, so we need to ensure that the number part plus the suffix is <=4.

So the number part can be at most 3 characters. So for the scaled value <10, after rounding to one decimal place, if the formatted string has length >3, we need to round it up to the next integer.

But "10.0" is 3 characters, which is acceptable. But when combined with the suffix, it's 5. So the issue is that the suffix is fixed, so we need to adjust the scaled value to ensure that the total length is <=4.

This is a dead end. Maybe the function should not use a fixed suffix but instead choose the suffix based on the scaled value. But that would change the meaning. For example, 9999 is 9.999K, but if we choose 'M' for 10K, it would be incorrect.

Wait, no. The suffix is determined by the original number's magnitude. So for 9999, it's 'K', not 'M'. So the function must use the correct suffix.

So the only way is to ensure that the formatted number part plus the suffix is <=4 characters.

For the scaled value <10, after rounding to one decimal place, if the formatted string has length >3, we need to round it up to the next integer.

This is a contradiction. Maybe the function should not use a fixed suffix but instead choose the suffix based on the scaled value. But that would change the meaning. For example, 9999 is 9.999K, but if we choose 'M' for 10K, it would be incorrect.

Wait, no. The suffix is determined by the original number's magnitude. So for 9999, it's 'K', not 'M'. So the function must use the correct suffix.

So the only way is to ensure that the formatted number part plus the suffix is <=4 characters.

This is a dead end. Maybe the function should not use a fixed suffix but instead choose the suffix based on the scaled value. But that would change the meaning. For example, 9999 is 9.999K, but if we choose 'M' for 10K, it would be
