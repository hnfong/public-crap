What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The given Python program is an infinite loop because the condition `x < math.inf` will always be true since `math.inf` is positive infinity. Therefore, the program will never print anything and will keep running indefinitely. The eventual output of this program is never reached.
