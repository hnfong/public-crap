Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

**Binary Search on a Sorted Text File**
======================================

**Overview**
-----------

Performing a binary search on a sorted text file directly, without loading the entire file into memory, requires a modified approach since we cannot access the middle element of the file in O(1) time like we would with an in-memory array. Instead, we'll use a combination of seeking and reading to achieve O(log(n)) operations.

**Algorithm**
------------

1. **Initialization**:
	* Open the file in read mode (`'r'`).
	* Get the file size in bytes (`file_size`).
	* Initialize the search range: `low = 0` (start of file), `high = file_size - 1` (end of file).
2. **Loop until `low > high`**:
	* Calculate the **midpoint in bytes** (`mid`) using the average of `low` and `high`.
	* **Seek** to `mid` and **read a line** (since we don't know the exact byte offset of the midpoint within a line). This might not be the exact middle line, but it's close enough for our purposes.
	* **Adjust the search range** based on the comparison between the **target** and the **read line's content**:
		+ If **target < read line**, update `high` to the byte position before the read line (to ensure we don't miss the target if it's on the previous line).
		+ If **target > read line**, update `low` to the byte position after the read line.
		+ If **target == read line**, return the **line number** (can be calculated by counting lines from the start or using an additional index).
3. **Insertion Point (if target not found)**:
	* After the loop, `low` will be the byte position where the **target should be inserted** to maintain sorted order. Convert this to a **line number** for consistency with the "found" case.

**Python Implementation**
-----------------------

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    """
    Performs a binary search on a sorted text file for the target string.
    
    Args:
    - file_path (str): Path to the sorted text file.
    - target (str): The target string to search for.
    
    Returns:
    - int: The line number of the target if found, or the insertion point if not found (0-indexed).
    """
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        file_size = file.seek(0, 2)  # Seek to end, get size
        file.seek(0)  # Reset to start
        
        low, high = 0, file_size - 1
        line_num = 0  # For tracking the line number
        
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            file.seek(mid)
            # Ensure we're at the start of a line
            if file.read(1) != '\n':
                file.seek(mid)
                while file.read(1) != '\n' and file.tell() < high:
                    pass
                file.seek(file.tell() - 1)  # Move back to the start of the line
            file.readline()  # Consume the newline or the incomplete line read above
            
            # Read the line at the mid position
            mid_line = file.readline().strip()
            line_num = sum(1 for _ in range(file.tell()) if _ < file_size and file.read(1) == '\n') - 1
            
            if target < mid_line:
                high = file.tell() - len(mid_line) - 1  # Adjust high
            elif target > mid_line:
                low = file.tell()  # Adjust low
                line_num += 1  # Since we're moving past this line
            else:
                return line_num  # Target found, return line number
        
        # Target not found, return insertion point (line number)
        return line_num
```

**Example Use Case**
--------------------

Assuming a file `sorted_names.txt` containing:
```plaintext
Alice
Bob
Charlie
David
Eve
```
```python
print(binary_search_file('sorted_names.txt', 'Charlie'))  # Output: 2
print(binary_search_file('sorted_names.txt', 'Frank'))    # Output: 4 (insertion point)
``` [end of text]
