What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The program will enter an infinite loop and never terminate. The variable `x` will keep increasing by 1.0 indefinitely, and the condition `x < math.inf` will always be true. Therefore, the program will never reach the `print(x)` statement and will not output anything.
<|im_end|>
