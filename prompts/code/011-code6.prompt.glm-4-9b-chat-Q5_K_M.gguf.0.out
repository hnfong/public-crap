Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

The program you've provided is designed to increment the value of `x` by a user-defined increment (`inc`) until `x` reaches or exceeds `math.inf`, which represents infinity in Python. The output "Done" will be printed once `x` reaches infinity.

Here are two examples of inputs that will lead to the output "Done":

1. **Input:** `1`
   - **Explanation:** Incrementing `x` by `1` will eventually lead to `x` reaching infinity.

2. **Input:** `0.1`
   - **Explanation:** Incrementing `x` by `0.1` will also eventually lead to `x` reaching infinity, albeit at a slower rate than with `1`.

Both of these inputs will cause the program to run indefinitely until `x` reaches infinity, at which point the program will print "Done". It's important to note that the program will not terminate on its own, as it is designed to run indefinitely until the condition `x < math.inf` is no longer true. Therefore, the output "Done" will be printed at the end of an infinite loop. In practice, this means the program will never actually print "Done" because it will keep running indefinitely. However, for the purpose of this exercise, we assume that the program will print "Done" once `x` reaches infinity, even though it will never happen in reality.
