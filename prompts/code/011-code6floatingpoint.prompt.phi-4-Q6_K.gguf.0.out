To answer these questions, we need to consider how floating-point arithmetic works in Python, which follows the IEEE 754 standard. This standard defines how floating-point numbers are represented and how arithmetic operations are performed on them.

### Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following Python program?

```python
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

**Answer:**

In this program, `x` starts at `0.0` and is incremented by `1.0` in each iteration of the loop. The loop continues as long as `x` is less than `math.inf`. In theory, this loop should run indefinitely because `x` will never reach infinity. However, due to the limitations of floating-point representation, there is a maximum representable finite value in IEEE 754 double precision, which is approximately `1.7976931348623157e+308`.

Once `x` exceeds this maximum value, adding `1.0` will cause `x` to become `inf` (infinity) due to overflow. Therefore, the loop will terminate, and the output will be `inf`.

### Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following Python program? Is it different from the results above?

```python
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

**Answer:**

In this program, `x` starts at `1.0` and is multiplied by `1.001` in each iteration. The loop continues as long as `x` is less than `math.inf`. Similar to the first program, `x` will eventually exceed the maximum representable finite value in IEEE 754 double precision.

As `x` grows exponentially, it will reach the maximum finite value and then overflow to `inf`. Once `x` becomes `inf`, multiplying it by `1.001` will still result in `inf`. Therefore, the loop will terminate, and the output will be `inf`.

The result is the same as in Q1, where the output is `inf`.

### Q3. Consider the following program:

```python
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

**Answer:**

For the loop to terminate and print "Done", `x` must eventually reach or exceed `math.inf`. This can happen if `inc` is positive and large enough to cause `x` to overflow to `inf` within a finite number of iterations.

Here are two examples of such inputs:

1. **Example 1:** `inc = 1.7976931348623157e+308`
   - In this case, after one iteration, `x` will become `1.7976931348623157e+308`, and adding `inc` again will cause `x` to overflow to `inf`.

2. **Example 2:** `inc = 1e+308`
   - Here, after approximately `1.7976931348623157e+308 / 1e+308 â‰ˆ 1797.6931348623157` iterations, `x` will exceed the maximum finite value and overflow to `inf`.

In both cases, the loop will terminate, and the program will print "Done". [end of text]
