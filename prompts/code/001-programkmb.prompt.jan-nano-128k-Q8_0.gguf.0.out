Okay, I need to write a Java program that reads input from standard input, extracts numbers followed by optional suffixes (like k, K, m, M, g, G), converts them to their base value (using 1024 for each unit), sums them all, and then prints the total sum along with the sum in kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes, each rounded to one decimal place.

First, I should think about how to parse the input. The input can have multiple lines, and each line might have numbers with suffixes. The numbers can have commas as thousand separators, like 1,500K. Also, the suffixes can be lowercase or uppercase. So I need to process each line, split into tokens, and extract each number with its suffix.

Hmm, the main challenge is to correctly parse the numbers and their suffixes. Let's break it down step by step.

The input is read from standard input. So I'll use a Scanner to read lines. But since the input can have multiple lines, maybe I should read all lines first, then process them.

Wait, but in Java, reading from stdin can be done with a Scanner that reads until the end of input. So perhaps I can read all lines into a single string, split them by whitespace, and process each token.

Wait, but the input might have numbers with commas, like "1.5G, 2K,". So the numbers are separated by commas, spaces, or other whitespace? Or maybe the numbers are separated by any whitespace, but the commas are part of the number.

Wait, the example input has "1.5G, 2K," which suggests that the numbers are separated by commas and spaces. But the problem says that the input can contain multiple lines, and the numbers can have commas as thousand separators. So the numbers can be in the format like "1,500K" or "1.5G".

So the approach is to split the input into tokens that represent numbers with possible suffixes. But how to split them? Because commas are part of the number (like in 1,500K) but also may be used as separators between numbers. Wait, but the problem says that the input can contain multiple lines, and the numbers are followed by optional suffixes. So perhaps the numbers are separated by whitespace, but commas inside the numbers are part of the number.

So the plan is: read all input lines, split them into tokens (split by whitespace), then for each token, parse the number and the suffix.

But how to split the tokens? For example, in the input "1.5G, 2K," the token would be "1.5G," and "2K,". Wait, but maybe the input is split into tokens by whitespace, so each token is a string that may contain a number with a suffix. So for each token, I need to process it to extract the number and the suffix.

So for each token, I can check if it ends with a suffix (k, K, m, M, g, G). Then, the number part is the part before the suffix. But the number can have commas as thousand separators. So for example, "1,500K" would be 1500 K, which is 1500 * 1024.

Wait, but the number can also be like "1.5G", which is 1.5 * 1024^3.

So the steps for each token:

1. Check if the token ends with a suffix (k, K, m, M, g, G). The suffix can be one of those letters. So first, I need to check if the token ends with any of those letters. But the suffix can be one character, so maybe I can check the last character of the token.

But wait, the suffix could be multiple letters? No, the problem says "optional suffixes (k, K, m, M, g, G)", so each suffix is a single character. So for each token, I can check if the last character is one of those letters. If so, then the suffix is that character, and the number is the part before it.

But what if the token is something like "123K"? Then the suffix is K, and the number is 123. But if the token is "123,456K", then the number is 123,456, which is 123456.

So the first thing is to process each token, split into the number part and the suffix part.

So for each token, I can check if it ends with a suffix. Let's think about the possible suffixes. The suffix can be any of k, K, m, M, g, G. So I can check the last character of the token.

But wait, what if the token is "123K"? Then the suffix is K. But if the token is "123K456", that's not possible, because the suffix is only one character. So the token must end with one of those letters.

So for each token, I can check if the last character is in the set {k, K, m, M, g, G}. If yes, then the suffix is that character, and the number is the substring before that character. Otherwise, it's just the number without a suffix, which would be in base units (like 1,000K is 1000 K, but if there's no suffix, then it's in base units, but the problem says that the suffix is optional. Wait, the problem says that the numbers are followed by optional suffixes. So the suffix is optional. So if a token is "123", then it's 123 in base units (i.e., 123 bytes?), but the problem says that the suffix is optional. Wait, but the example input includes "1.5G, 2K," which implies that the suffix is optional. So the program should handle numbers without suffixes as well. But according to the problem statement, the suffix is optional. So the numbers can be in base units (like 1,000) or with suffixes (like 1K, 1M, etc.)

Wait, but the problem says that the numbers are followed by optional suffixes. So the suffix is optional. So for example, "123" is a number without a suffix, which would be 123 bytes. But the problem says that the suffix is optional, but the example output includes the sum in K, M, G. So the program needs to convert all numbers to their base value, regardless of the suffix. So the suffix is part of the unit, and the base value is the value multiplied by 1024^unit.

So the first thing is to parse each token into a number and a suffix. For example, "1.5G" is 1.5 * 1024^3. "1,500K" is 1500 * 1024. "500,000K" is 500000 * 1024.

So the plan is:

- Read all input lines into a single string, split into tokens by whitespace (split on whitespace, including newlines). But maybe it's better to read each line, split into tokens, and process each token.

But how to split the input into tokens? Because the input can have multiple lines, and each line can have multiple tokens. So perhaps using a Scanner that reads all lines, and splits the input into tokens by whitespace.

So, for example, the input:

"1.5G, 2K,\n3M, and 4.2G\n500,000K and 600M"

When split into tokens by whitespace, the tokens would be "1.5G,", "2K,", "3M,", "and", "4.2G", "500,000K", "and", "600M".

But the problem is that the tokens may contain commas as part of the number. So the token "1.5G," is not a valid number with suffix. Wait, but the example input has "1.5G, 2K," which would be split into "1.5G," and "2K,". But the suffix is the last character of the token. So in the first token, "1.5G," the suffix is G, but the token ends with a comma. Wait, that's a problem. Because the token may have a comma after the suffix. Wait, but the example input shows that the token "1.5G," is part of the input. But according to the example output, the sum is 7264621772.8. Let me check the example input again.

Example input:

1.5G, 2K,
3M, and 4.2G
500,000K and 600M

So the first line is "1.5G, 2K,". So the tokens would be "1.5G,", "2K,". But the suffix is the last character of the token. Wait, but in the first token, "1.5G," ends with a comma. So that's not correct. So perhaps the tokens are not split by whitespace, but the numbers are separated by any whitespace, but the suffix is part of the number. So maybe the token is "1.5G", "2K", "3M", "4.2G", "500,000K", "600M".

But how to split the input into these tokens? Because the input may have commas in the numbers, but the suffix is only the last character. So perhaps the correct approach is to split the input into tokens that are numbers followed by optional suffixes, but the suffix is only the last character of the token. So the token must end with one of the suffix letters (k, K, m, M, g, G) or not.

Wait, but the example input has "1.5G, 2K," which would be split into "1.5G," and "2K,". But the suffix is G and K, but the token ends with a comma. So that's a problem. So maybe the input is not split by whitespace, but the numbers are separated by any non-digit, non-dot, non-comma, etc. But that's complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the input is such that each number is followed by a suffix (optional) and then possibly other characters (like commas, spaces, etc.) but the numbers are in the format that can be parsed as a number with optional suffix.

Wait, the problem says that the input can contain multiple lines, and the numbers are followed by optional suffixes. So the numbers can be in the input as "1.5G", "2K", "3M", "4.2G", "500,000K", "600M", etc. So the suffix is the last character of the token if it's one of those letters. But in the example input, the first line is "1.5G, 2K," which would have tokens "1.5G," and "2K,". But the suffix is G and K, but the token ends with a comma. So that's not correct. Therefore, perhaps the input is such that the numbers are followed by optional suffixes, and the rest of the token is not part of the number. So maybe the token is something like "1.5G", "2K", "3M", "4.2G", "500,000K", "600M".

But how to split the input into these tokens? Because the input may have commas in the numbers, but the suffix is only the last character. So perhaps the correct way is to split the input into tokens that are numbers followed by optional suffixes, but the suffix is only the last character of the token. So the token must end with one of the suffix letters, or not.

But how to handle the case where the token is "1.5G,"? That would have a suffix of G, but the comma is after. So maybe the input is such that the numbers are followed by optional suffixes, and the rest of the token is not part of the number. So perhaps the token is "1.5G", "2K", "3M", "4.2G", "500,000K", "600M".

But how to split the input into these tokens? Because the input may have commas in the numbers, but the suffix is only the last character. So maybe the correct approach is to split the input into tokens that are numbers with possible suffixes, but the suffix is only the last character of the token. So the token must end with one of the suffix letters, or not. So for example, "1.5G" is a valid token, "1.5G," is not, but the comma is part of the token. Wait, but in the example input, the first line is "1.5G, 2K," which would have tokens "1.5G," and "2K,". But according to the example output, the sum includes 1.5G, 2K, 3M, 4.2G, 500,000K, 600M. So the commas in the input are not part of the numbers. So perhaps the input is such that the numbers are followed by optional suffixes, and the rest of the token is not part of the number. So the commas in the input are part of the token, but they are not part of the number. Wait, but that's not possible. For example, in the input "1,500K", the number is 1,500, which is 1500, and the suffix is K. So the token is "1,500K", which ends with K. So the comma is part of the number.

So the problem is that the input may have commas in the number part, but the suffix is the last character of the token. So the token must end with a suffix (k, K, m, M, g, G) or not. So the approach is to process each token, check if it ends with a suffix, and if so, take the suffix as the unit, and the rest of the token as the number. But if the token does not end with a suffix, then it's just the number in base units.

But how to split the input into tokens? Because the input may have commas in the numbers, but the suffix is only the last character. So perhaps the correct way is to split the input into tokens by whitespace, and then for each token, process it to extract the number and the suffix.

So for example, the token "1.5G," would be processed as follows: check if the last character is a suffix. The last character is ',', which is not a suffix. So that's not a valid number. But in the example input, the first line is "1.5G, 2K," which would have tokens "1.5G," and "2K,". But according to the example output, the numbers are 1.5G, 2K, 3M, 4.2G, 500,000K, 600M. So the commas in the input are not part of the numbers. Therefore, perhaps the input is such that the numbers are followed by optional suffixes, and the rest of the token is not part of the number. So the token is "1.5G", "2K", "3M", "4.2G", "500,000K", "600M".

But how to split the input into these tokens? Because the input may have commas in the numbers, but the suffix is only the last character. So the problem is that the input may have commas in the number part, but the suffix is the last character. So the token must end with a suffix, or not. So perhaps the correct way is to process each token, and check if it ends with a suffix. If it does, then the suffix is the last character, and the number is the part before that. If not, then the entire token is the number.

But how to handle tokens that have commas in them but no suffix? For example, "1,500" would be a number without a suffix, which is 1500 bytes. But the problem says that the numbers can have commas as thousand separators. So the token "1,500" is a valid number, and the suffix is not present.

So the plan is:

For each token in the input:

- Check if the token ends with a suffix (k, K, m, M, g, G). If yes, then the suffix is that character, and the number is the part before the suffix.

- If not, then the entire token is the number.

But how to handle the case where the token is "1,500K"? Then the suffix is K, and the number is "1,500".

So the steps for each token:

1. Check if the token ends with one of the suffix letters. If yes, then split the token into the number part and the suffix.

2. Parse the number part as a decimal number (with commas as thousand separators). So for example, "1,500" becomes 1500.

3. Convert the number to the base value based on the suffix.

But how to parse the number part with commas? For example, "1,500" is 1500. So in Java, I can replace commas with nothing, then parse as a double.

So for the number part, first replace commas with empty string, then parse as a double.

So for example, "1,500K" becomes "1500K", so the number is 1500, suffix is K.

So the code steps:

- Read all input lines into a single string, then split into tokens by whitespace.

- For each token, check if it ends with a suffix (k, K, m, M, g, G). If yes, then take the suffix as the unit, and the rest as the number.

- Then, process the number part by removing commas and converting to a double.

- Then, multiply by the appropriate factor based on the suffix.

But how to handle the suffix? Let's create a map for the suffix to the multiplier. For example:

kilo = 1024, mega = 1024^2, giga = 1024^3.

So the suffix can be 'k', 'K', 'm', 'M', 'g', 'G'. So the code can check the suffix and determine the multiplier.

So the code can have a map like:

Map<Character, Double> suffixMap = new HashMap<>();
suffixMap.put('k', 1024.0);
suffixMap.put('K', 1024.0);
suffixMap.put('m', 1024.0 * 1024.0);
suffixMap.put('M', 1024.0 * 1024.0);
suffixMap.put('g', 1024.0 * 1024.0 * 1024.0);
suffixMap.put('G', 1024.0 * 1024.0 * 1024.0);

But wait, the problem says that the suffix is optional. So if the token does not end with a suffix, then the unit is base (1), so the value is the number as is.

So for each token, first check if it ends with a suffix. If it does, then take the suffix, else no suffix.

But how to check that? For example, the token could be "1.5G", "2K", "3M", etc. So for each token, check if the last character is in the suffix set.

So code steps:

Loop through each token:

for (String token : tokens) {
    if (token.endsWith("k") || token.endsWith("K") || token.endsWith("m") || token.endsWith("M") || token.endsWith("g") || token.endsWith("G")) {
        // process with suffix
        char suffix = token.charAt(token.length() - 1);
        String numberStr = token.substring(0, token.length() - 1);
        // parse numberStr, replace commas, then convert to double
        double number = parseNumber(numberStr);
        double value = number * suffixMap.get(suffix);
        sum += value;
    } else {
        // process without suffix
        String numberStr = token;
        double number = parseNumber(numberStr);
        sum += number;
    }
}

But wait, the token could be "1.5G," which ends with a comma. So the code would not process it as a number with suffix. But according to the example input, the first line is "1.5G, 2K," which would have tokens "1.5G," and "2K,". But according to the example output, the numbers are 1.5G, 2K, etc. So perhaps the input is such that the suffix is the last character of the token, and any other characters after that are not part of the number. So in the example input, the first token is "1.5G," which ends with a comma, but the suffix is G. Wait, but that's not possible. So maybe the input is not split by whitespace, but the numbers are separated by any non-digit, non-dot, non-comma, etc. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the input is such that the numbers are followed by optional suffixes, and the rest of the token is not part of the number. So the token is "1.5G", "2K", etc. So the commas in the input are part of the number, but the suffix is the last character of the token. So in the example input, the first line is "1.5G, 2K," which would have tokens "1.5G," and "2K,". But the suffix is G and K, but the token ends with a comma. So that's not correct. Therefore, perhaps the input is not split by whitespace, but the numbers are separated by any whitespace, and the suffix is the last character of the token, but the token may have other characters after the suffix. Wait, but that's not possible. So maybe the input is such that the numbers are followed by optional suffixes, and the rest of the token is not part of the number. So the token is "1.5G", "2K", etc. So the commas in the input are part of the number, but the suffix is the last character of the token.

But how to handle the example input? Let's look at the example input again:

The first line is "1.5G, 2K,". So the numbers are 1.5G and 2K. But the commas are part of the input, but not part of the numbers. So perhaps the input is split into tokens by whitespace, and the commas are part of the number. So the token "1.5G," is not a valid number, but the token "1.5G" is. So maybe the input is such that the numbers are followed by optional suffixes, and the rest of the token is not part of the number. Therefore, the code should process each token, and check if the last character is a suffix. If it is, then the suffix is that character, and the rest is the number. But if the token ends with a comma, then it's not a valid number. So perhaps the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix, and if so, take that as the suffix, and the rest as the number. Otherwise, the entire token is the number.

But in the example input, the first line is "1.5G, 2K,". So the tokens would be "1.5G,", "2K,". But according to the example output, the numbers are 1.5G, 2K, etc. So the code would process "1.5G," as a token that ends with a comma, which is not a suffix. Therefore, it would not process it as a number with suffix. But that's not correct. Therefore, perhaps the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix, but if not, then check if the token has a suffix in the middle. But that's complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the input is such that the numbers are followed by optional suffixes, and the rest of the token is not part of the number. So the code should process each token by checking if it ends with a suffix. If it does, then the suffix is the last character, and the rest is the number. But if the token ends with a comma, then it's not a valid number. So perhaps the example input is not correct, but according to the example output, the numbers are 1.5G, 2K, 3M, 4.2G, 500,000K, 600M. So the first line's tokens are "1.5G", "2K", etc. So maybe the input is split into tokens by whitespace, and the commas are part of the number. So the code should process the token as follows: the number is the part before the last character if it's a suffix, else the entire token.

But how to handle the case where the token is "1.5G,"? That would be a problem. So perhaps the input is such that the numbers are followed by optional suffixes, and the rest of the token is not part of the number. Therefore, the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix. If yes, then take the suffix, else take the entire token as the number.

But in the example input, the first line is "1.5G, 2K,". So the tokens would be "1.5G,", "2K,". But according to the example output, the numbers are 1.5G and 2K. So perhaps the code should process the token by removing any trailing comma or other characters that are not part of the suffix. But that's not clear.

Alternatively, maybe the input is such that the numbers are followed by optional suffixes, and the rest of the token is not part of the number. So the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix. If it is, then the suffix is that character, and the rest is the number. If not, then the entire token is the number.

But in the example input, the first line is "1.5G, 2K,". So the tokens would be "1.5G," and "2K,". But the code would check if the last character is a suffix. For "1.5G,", the last character is ',', which is not a suffix. So the code would take the entire token as the number. But that would be "1.5G," which is not a valid number. So that's a problem.

Wait, but the example input's first line is "1.5G, 2K,". So the numbers are 1.5G and 2K. So the commas are part of the input, but not part of the numbers. So perhaps the code should split the input into tokens that are numbers with suffixes, but the commas are part of the number. So the code should process the token as follows: the number is the part before the suffix, and the suffix is the last character. But the token may have commas in the number part.

So for example, the token "1.5G" is valid. The token "1,500K" is valid. The token "1.5G," is invalid, but in the example input, the first line is "1.5G, 2K," which would have tokens "1.5G," and "2K,". But according to the example output, the numbers are 1.5G and 2K. So perhaps the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix, and if so, take the suffix and the rest as the number. But if the token ends with a comma, then it's not a valid number. So maybe the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix, and if not, then check if the token is a valid number (without suffix). But how to handle that.

Alternatively, perhaps the code should process the token by checking if it ends with a suffix, and if so, take the suffix and the rest as the number. Otherwise, the entire token is the number. But in the example input, the first line's tokens are "1.5G," and "2K,". So the code would process "1.5G," as a number without suffix, but that's not correct. So perhaps the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix, and if so, take the suffix and the rest as the number. But if the token ends with a comma, then it's not a valid number. Therefore, the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix.

Therefore, perhaps the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix, and if so, take the suffix and the rest as the number. But the token may have other characters after the suffix. For example, "1.5G," would have the suffix G, and the rest is "1.5", but the comma is after the suffix. So that's not correct.

Wait, but the example input's first line is "1.5G, 2K,". So the numbers are 1.5G and 2K. So the commas are part of the input, but not part of the numbers. Therefore, the code should split the input into tokens that are numbers with suffixes, and the commas are part of the input but not part of the numbers. So perhaps the code should split the input into tokens by whitespace, and then for each token, process it by checking if it ends with a suffix. If it does, then the suffix is the last character, and the rest is the number. But if the token ends with a comma, then it's not a valid number. So perhaps the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix, and if so, take the suffix and the rest as the number. Otherwise, the entire token is the number.

But in the example input, the first line's tokens are "1.5G," and "2K,". So the code would process "1.5G," as a token that ends with a comma, which is not a suffix. Therefore, the code would take the entire token as the number. But that's not correct. Therefore, perhaps the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix, and if so, take the suffix and the rest as the number. But if the token ends with a suffix, then the rest is the number part. So for example, "1.5G" ends with G, so the number is "1.5", and the suffix is G. But "1.5G," ends with a comma, so the code would not process it as a number with suffix. Therefore, the example input must have the tokens "1.5G", "2K", etc. So perhaps the input is such that the numbers are followed by optional suffixes, and the rest of the token is not part of the number. Therefore, the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix. If yes, then take the suffix and the rest as the number. But if the token ends with a comma, then it's not a valid number. Therefore, the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix. If not, then the entire token is the number.

But how to handle the example input? Let's look at the example input again:

The first line is "1.5G, 2K,". So the numbers are 1.5G and 2K. So the code should process "1.5G" and "2K" as the tokens. But how to split the input into those tokens. Because the input has commas after the numbers. So perhaps the code should split the input into tokens by whitespace, and then for each token, check if it ends with a suffix. If it does, then process it. Otherwise, check if it's a valid number (without suffix). But in the example input, the token "1.5G," would not end with a suffix, but the code would process it as a number. But that's not correct.

This suggests that the code should process the token by checking if it ends with a suffix, and if so, take the suffix and the rest as the number. But if the token ends with a comma, then it's not a valid number. Therefore, perhaps the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix. If yes, then take the suffix and the rest as the number. Otherwise, the entire token is the number.

But in the example input, the first line's tokens are "1.5G," and "2K,". So the code would process "1.5G," as a token that does not end with a suffix (since the last character is a comma), so the entire token is the number. But that's not correct. Therefore, perhaps the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix, and if so, take the suffix and the rest as the number. But if the token ends with a comma, then it's not a valid number. Therefore, the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix. If not, then the entire token is the number. But in the example input, the first line's tokens are "1.5G," and "2K,". So the code would process "1.5G," as a number without suffix, but that's not correct. Therefore, perhaps the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix, and if so, take the suffix and the rest as the number. But the token may have other characters after the suffix. So perhaps the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix, and if so, then the suffix is that character, and the rest is the number part. But the rest may contain commas, which are part of the number.

So for example, the token "1.5G," would have the suffix as G, but the rest is "1.5", and the comma is after the suffix. But that's not correct. Therefore, perhaps the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix, and if so, then the suffix is that character, and the rest is the number part. But the rest may contain commas, which are part of the number.

So the code would process "1.5G," as follows: the last character is ',', which is not a suffix. Therefore, the entire token is the number. But that's not correct. Therefore, perhaps the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix, and if so, take the suffix and the rest as the number. But the token may have other characters after the suffix. So maybe the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix, and if so, then the suffix is that character, and the rest is the number part. But the rest may contain commas, which are part of the number.

But in the example input, the first line's tokens are "1.5G," and "2K,". So the code would process "1.5G," as a token that ends with a comma, which is not a suffix. Therefore, the code would take the entire token as the number. But that's not correct. Therefore, perhaps the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix, and if so, take the suffix and the rest as the number. But if the token ends with a comma, then it's not a valid number. Therefore, the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix. If yes, then process the suffix and the rest. Otherwise, process the entire token as the number.

But how to handle the example input? The example input's first line is "1.5G, 2K,". So the tokens would be "1.5G,", "2K,". But according to the example output, the numbers are 1.5G and 2K. Therefore, the code must process the token "1.5G," as a number with suffix G, but the comma is after the suffix. So perhaps the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix, and if so, take the suffix and the rest as the number. But the rest may contain commas. So for example, "1.5G," would have the suffix G, and the rest is "1.5", but the comma is after the suffix. So that's not correct. Therefore, perhaps the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix, and if so, then the suffix is that character, and the rest is the number part.

But the rest may contain commas, which are part of the number.

But how to handle the case where the token is "1.5G,"? It's possible that the token is "1.5G," which is not a valid number. Therefore, perhaps the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix. If yes, then take the suffix and the rest as the number. Otherwise, the entire token is the number. But in the example input, the first line's tokens are "1.5G," and "2K,". So the code would process "1.5G," as a token that does not end with a suffix, so the entire token is the number. But that's not correct. Therefore, perhaps the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix, and if so, take the suffix and the rest as the number. But the rest may contain commas, which are part of the number.

But in the example input, the first line's tokens are "1.5G," and "2K,". So the code would process "1.5G," as a number without suffix, but that's not correct. Therefore, perhaps the code should process the token by checking if the last character is a suffix, and if so, take the suffix and the rest as the number. But the rest may contain commas, which are part of the number.
