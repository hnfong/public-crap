To perform a binary search on a file directly, we need to read the file in chunks rather than loading the entire file into memory. This approach ensures that we only read the necessary parts of the file, maintaining an efficient search process.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to perform a binary search on a file:

1. **Open the File**: Open the file in read mode.
2. **Binary Search Logic**: Implement the binary search logic, but instead of accessing elements by index, read the file at specific byte positions.
3. **Seek and Read**: Use the `seek()` method to move the file pointer to the desired position and read the line at that position.
4. **Compare and Adjust**: Compare the target with the read line and adjust the search range accordingly.
5. **Return the Result**: Return the position where the target should be inserted if it is not found.

Here's the Python function to perform this binary search:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Get the total number of lines in the file
        file.seek(0, 2)  # Move the cursor to the end of the file
        file_size = file.tell()
        file.seek(0)  # Move the cursor back to the beginning of the file

        # Initialize the search range
        low, high = 0, 0
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            for current, l in enumerate(f):
                pass
            high = current + 1

        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2

            # Move the file pointer to the mid position
            file.seek(0)
            for _ in range(mid):
                file.readline()

            # Read the line at the mid position
            mid_line = file.readline().strip()

            if mid_line == target:
                return mid
            elif mid_line < target:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid

        return low

# Example usage:
# Assuming 'names.txt' is a file with names sorted in lexicographical order
# result = binary_search_file('names.txt', 'John')
# print(result)
```

### Explanation:
1. **File Handling**: The file is opened in read mode. We first move the file pointer to the end to determine the file size, then back to the beginning to start reading.
2. **Line Counting**: We count the total number of lines in the file to set the initial `high` value for the binary search range.
3. **Binary Search Loop**: We perform the binary search by calculating the middle index (`mid`). We then move the file pointer to the `mid` position by reading lines sequentially.
4. **Comparison**: We read the line at the `mid` position and compare it with the target. Depending on the comparison, we adjust the `low` and `high` values.
5. **Return**: If the target is found, we return its position. If not, we return the insertion point (`low`).

This approach ensures that we only read the necessary parts of the file, maintaining an efficient search process with at most O(log(n)) operations. [end of text]
