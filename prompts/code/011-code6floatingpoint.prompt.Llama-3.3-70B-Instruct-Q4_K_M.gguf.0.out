Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

## Step 1: Understanding the IEEE 754 Floating Point Representation
IEEE 754 floating point representation is a standard for representing floating-point numbers in computers. It has a specific format that includes a sign bit, exponent, and mantissa. The key aspect relevant to the given problem is that it has a maximum representable value, often referred to as `inf` (infinity), which is a special value that represents a number larger than any other number.

## Step 2: Analyzing the First Python Program
The first program starts with `x = 0.0` and increments `x` by `1.0` in each iteration of the while loop, as long as `x` is less than `math.inf`. Given the nature of floating-point arithmetic, as `x` grows, the increment of `1.0` becomes less significant compared to the magnitude of `x`. However, due to the way floating-point numbers are represented, there is a maximum value that can be represented, beyond which the increment operation will not change the value of `x` because the increment is smaller than the smallest representable difference at that scale.

## Step 3: Determining the Eventual Output of the First Program
The loop will continue until `x` reaches the maximum representable finite value, at which point adding `1.0` will not change `x` because the result of the addition would exceed the maximum representable value, causing `x` to become `inf`. Once `x` becomes `inf`, the loop condition `x < math.inf` will be false, and the loop will terminate. The eventual output of the program will be `inf`.

The final answer is: $\boxed{inf}$ [end of text]
