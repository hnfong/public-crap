What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)

assistant
The output of the given Python program is:

1.001

This is because the value of `x` is initially set to 1.0, and the loop continues to multiply `x` by 1.001 until `x` exceeds the infinity value. The loop terminates when `x` is no longer less than infinity. [end of text]
