Bubble Sort:
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.

Here's a Python implementation of bubble sort:
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        swapped = False
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
                swapped = True
        if not swapped:
            return arr
    return arr
```

Merge Sort:
Merge sort is a sorting technique based on the divide-and-conquer paradigm. The algorithm consists of recursively dividing the unsorted list into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the two halves into a single sorted list.

Here's a Python implementation of merge sort:
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left_half = arr[:mid]
        right_half = arr[mid:]

        merge_sort(left_half)
        merge_sort(right_half)

        i = j = k = 0

        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
                arr[k] = left_half[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right_half[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        while i < len(left_half):
            arr[k] = left_half[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1

        while j < len(right_half):
            arr[k] = right_half[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
    return arr
```

Comparison:
1. Complexity: Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which makes it inefficient for large data sets. Merge sort, on the other hand, has a time complexity of O(n log n), which is significantly faster for large data sets.
2. Stability: Both bubble sort and merge sort are stable sorting algorithms, meaning that they preserve the relative order of elements with equal values.
3. Space Complexity: Bubble sort has a space complexity of O(1), which means it uses a constant amount of additional memory space. Merge sort has a space complexity of O(n), as it uses additional memory for the merging process.
4. Adaptability: Neither bubble sort nor merge sort is adaptive. They perform the same number of comparisons and swaps regardless of whether the input list is nearly sorted or randomly ordered.
5. Implementation: Bubble sort is simple to implement and is often used as an introductory sorting algorithm. Merge sort, while not overly complex, is slightly more difficult to implement due to its recursive nature.

In summary, while both algorithms are stable, merge sort is generally preferred over bubble sort due to its superior time complexity. Bubble sort is only preferable for small data sets or as an educational tool.</s>
