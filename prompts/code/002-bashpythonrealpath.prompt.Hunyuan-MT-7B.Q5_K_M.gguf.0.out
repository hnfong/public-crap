Here is the completed realpath() function using Python:

```python
def realpath():
    return os.path.realpath()

set -x
my_real_path=$(realpath "$0")
echo "The real path of this script is $my_real_path"
```

Explanation:
The realpath() function uses the os.path.realpath() function in Python to get the real path of the current script. The os.path.realpath() function returns the absolute path of the file or directory that is called. In this case, it returns the absolute path of the script that is being executed. [end of text]
