<Thought>
Alright, I need to write a Python function named `abbrev_num` that takes an integer and returns a string representing the number in a compact, human-readable form. The examples provided are:

- 2 => "2"
- 8180 => "8.2K"
- 9385832 => "9.4M"

The key requirements are:

1. **Compact Representation**: The output string should be less than 4 characters if possible.
2. **Order of Magnitude**: Represent the number with a couple of significant digits and indicate the order of magnitude (K for thousands, M for millions, etc.).
3. **Rounding**: Round the number to the nearest thousand, million, etc., and ensure the output string does not exceed 4 characters.

First, I'll consider the different orders of magnitude:

- **K**: Thousands (10^3)
- **M**: Millions (10^6)
- **B**: Billions (10^9)
- **T**: Trillions (10^12)

Given that the output string should be less than 4 characters, I need to determine the appropriate magnitude based on the input number. For example:

- If the number is less than 1000, it can be represented as is.
- If it's between 1000 and 999,999, abbreviate it with 'K'.
- If it's between 1,000,000 and 999,999,999, abbreviate it with 'M'.
- And so on.

Next, I'll think about how to implement the rounding:

- For 'K', divide the number by 1000 and round to one decimal place.
- For 'M', divide by 1,000,000 and round to one decimal place.
- For 'B', divide by 1,000,000,000 and round to one decimal place.
- For 'T', divide by 1,000,000,000,000 and round to one decimal place.

I also need to handle edge cases:

- Numbers exactly at the boundary (e.g., 1,000,000 should be '1.0M').
- Very large numbers that might exceed the 4-character limit even after abbreviating (e.g., 1,000,000,000 should be '1.0B').

Now, I'll outline the steps for the function:

1. **Determine the Order of Magnitude**:
   - Calculate the exponent of 10 that the number falls into.
   - Map the exponent to the corresponding abbreviation ('K', 'M', 'B', 'T').

2. **Calculate the Rounded Value**:
   - Divide the number by 10 raised to the exponent.
   - Round the result to one decimal place.

3. **Construct the Output String**:
   - Combine the rounded value with the abbreviation.

4. **Ensure the Output is Less Than 4 Characters**:
   - If the abbreviation is longer than necessary (e.g., '1.0K' is 4 characters), consider removing the decimal part to keep it under 4 characters.

5. **Handle Edge Cases**:
   - Ensure that numbers exactly at the boundary are correctly abbreviated.
   - Ensure that very large numbers are abbreviated appropriately without exceeding the 4-character limit.

I'll also think about potential errors or exceptions:

- **Negative Numbers**: The problem doesn't specify how to handle negative numbers. For simplicity, I'll assume the input is always a positive integer.
- **Non-integer Inputs**: The problem specifies that the input is an integer, so I don't need to handle non-integer types.

Finally, I'll proceed to write the function in Python, ensuring that it adheres to the specified requirements and handles the outlined scenarios appropriately.

```python
def abbrev_num(x):
    if x < 1000:
        return str(x)
    abbreviations = ['K', 'M', 'B', 'T']
    for i, abbr in enumerate(abbreviations):
        if x < 1000 ** (i + 2):
            break
    scaled = round(x / (1000 ** i), 1)
    if scaled >= 10:
        scaled = round(x / (1000 ** i), 0)
    return f"{scaled}{abbr}"
```
