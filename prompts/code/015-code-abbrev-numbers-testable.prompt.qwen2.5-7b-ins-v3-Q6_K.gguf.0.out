<Thought>
Alright, I need to write a Python function named `abbrev_num` that takes an integer and returns a string representing the number in a compact, human-readable form. The examples provided are:

- 2 => "2"
- 8180 => "8.2K"
- 9385832 => "9.4M"

The key requirements are:

1. **Compact Representation**: The output string should be as short as possible, ideally <= 4 characters.
2. **Order of Magnitude**: The string should indicate the order of magnitude (K for thousands, M for millions, etc.).
3. **Significant Digits**: Use a couple of significant digits, rounding appropriately.

First, I'll consider the different orders of magnitude and how to map them:

- **K**: Thousands (10^3)
- **M**: Millions (10^6)
- **B**: Billions (10^9)
- **T**: Trillions (10^12)

Given that the output string should be <= 4 characters, I need to decide how many significant digits to include based on the magnitude:

- For **K**, rounding to one decimal place seems reasonable.
- For **M**, rounding to one decimal place should also work.
- For **B** and **T**, rounding to one decimal place might make the string too long, so perhaps rounding to the nearest whole number would be better.

Next, I'll think about the steps the function needs to perform:

1. **Determine the Order of Magnitude**:
   - Check if the number is >= 1,000,000,000,000 (1 trillion) → use 'T'
   - Else, check if >= 1,000,000,000 → use 'B'
   - Else, check if >= 1,000,000 → use 'M'
   - Else, check if >= 1,000 → use 'K'
   - Else, return the number as is.

2. **Calculate the Appropriate Value**:
   - For 'K', divide by 1,000 and round to one decimal place.
   - For 'M', divide by 1,000,000 and round to one decimal place.
   - For 'B', divide by 1,000,000,000 and round to one decimal place.
   - For 'T', divide by 1,000,000,000,000 and round to one decimal place.
   - For numbers < 1,000, return the number as is.

3. **Format the Output**:
   - Combine the rounded value with the appropriate suffix.

Now, considering edge cases:

- **Numbers Exactly at the Threshold**: For example, 1,000,000 should be represented as '1.0M'.
- **Very Large Numbers**: Ensure that the function handles numbers like 1,000,000,000,000 correctly.
- **Negative Numbers**: The problem doesn't specify handling negative numbers, so I'll assume all inputs are positive integers.
- **Zero**: Should return '0' as is.

I'll also think about the implementation:

- Use a loop or a series of `if-elif-else` statements to determine the magnitude.
- Use the `round()` function to round the appropriate value.
- Use string formatting to combine the rounded number with the suffix.

Finally, I'll write the function ensuring it adheres to the <= 4 character limit for the output string.

```python
def abbrev_num(x):
    if x >= 1e12:
        return f"{round(x / 1e12, 1)}T"
    elif x >= 1e9:
        return f"{round(x / 1e9, 1)}B"
    elif x >= 1e6:
        return f"{round(x / 1e6, 1)}M"
    elif x >= 1e3:
        return f"{round(x / 1e3, 1)}K"
    else:
        return str(x)
```
