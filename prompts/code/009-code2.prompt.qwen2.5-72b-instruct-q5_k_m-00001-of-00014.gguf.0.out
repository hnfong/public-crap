Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a text file directly, we need to treat the file as a sorted array of lines. The key challenge is that we cannot directly access the middle element of the file as we would in an array, because files are typically accessed sequentially. However, we can use a combination of file seeking and line reading to achieve this.

Here's a step-by-step approach to perform a binary search on a text file:

1. **Determine the number of lines in the file**: This is necessary to set the initial bounds for the binary search.
2. **Seek to the middle of the file**: Use file seeking to move to the approximate middle of the file.
3. **Read the line at the current position**: Read the line to compare it with the target.
4. **Adjust the search bounds**: Based on the comparison, adjust the search bounds and repeat the process.

Here is the Python function `binary_search_file` that implements this approach:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    def get_line_at_position(file, pos):
        file.seek(pos)
        file.readline()  # Skip any partial line
        return file.readline()

    def count_lines(file):
        with open(file, 'r') as f:
            return sum(1 for _ in f)

    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        num_lines = count_lines(file_path)
        low, high = 0, num_lines

        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            file.seek(0)
            for _ in range(mid):
                file.readline()
            mid_line = file.readline().strip()

            if mid_line == target:
                return mid
            elif mid_line < target:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid

        return low  # Return the insertion point if the target is not found

# Example usage:
file_path = 'names.txt'
target = 'John'
position = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
print(f"Position of '{target}': {position}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **`get_line_at_position`**: This helper function seeks to a specific position in the file and reads the next complete line.
2. **`count_lines`**: This helper function counts the number of lines in the file.
3. **Main function**:
   - Open the file and count the number of lines.
   - Initialize the search bounds `low` and `high`.
   - Perform the binary search:
     - Calculate the middle index `mid`.
     - Seek to the beginning of the file and read up to the `mid` line.
     - Compare the middle line with the target.
     - Adjust the search bounds based on the comparison.
   - If the target is found, return its position.
   - If the target is not found, return the insertion point.

This approach ensures that the binary search is performed in O(log(n)) operations, where n is the number of lines in the file. [end of text]
