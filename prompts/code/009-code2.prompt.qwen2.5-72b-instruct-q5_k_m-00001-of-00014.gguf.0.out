To perform a binary search on a text file directly, we need to treat the file as a sequence of lines and use a binary search algorithm to find the target line. The key challenge is that we cannot directly access the middle of the file in constant time, as we can with an array. Instead, we need to seek to the middle of the file and then read from there to find the start of the line.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Seek to the middle of the file**: Use the `seek` method to move to the middle of the file.
2. **Find the start of the line**: Read backwards to find the start of the line.
3. **Compare the line with the target**: Read the line and compare it with the target.
4. **Adjust the search range**: Based on the comparison, adjust the search range and repeat the process.

Here's the Python function `binary_search_file` that implements this approach:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    def find_start_of_line(file, pos):
        # Move to the position
        file.seek(pos)
        # Read backwards to find the start of the line
        while pos > 0:
            file.seek(pos - 1)
            if file.read(1) == b'\n':
                break
            pos -= 1
        return pos

    def read_line(file, pos):
        file.seek(pos)
        return file.readline().strip()

    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        # Get the file size
        file.seek(0, 2)
        file_size = file.tell()
        
        # Initialize the search range
        low = 0
        high = file_size
        
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            mid_pos = find_start_of_line(file, mid)
            mid_line = read_line(file, mid_pos)
            
            if mid_line == target:
                return mid_pos
            elif mid_line < target:
                low = mid_pos + len(mid_line) + 1
            else:
                high = mid_pos
        
        # If the target is not found, return the insertion point
        return low

# Example usage
file_path = "myfile.txt"
target = b"2 by"
position = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
print(position)  # Output should be 17
```

### Explanation:

1. **find_start_of_line**: This helper function moves the file pointer to the start of the line at the given position. It reads backwards until it finds a newline character.
2. **read_line**: This helper function reads the line starting from the given position.
3. **binary_search_file**:
   - **Initialize the search range**: `low` is 0 and `high` is the file size.
   - **Binary search loop**: Calculate the middle position, find the start of the line at that position, and read the line.
   - **Compare the line with the target**: If the line matches the target, return the position. If the line is less than the target, adjust the lower bound. If the line is greater than the target, adjust the upper bound.
   - **Return the insertion point**: If the target is not found, return the position where it should be inserted.

This approach ensures that the binary search is performed in O(log(n)) operations, where n is the number of lines in the file. [end of text]
