Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Sure, here's a simple implementation of bubble sort and merge sort in Python:

```python
# Bubble Sort
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
  
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1] :
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

# Merge Sort
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr)//2
        L = arr[:mid]
        R = arr[mid:]
        merge_sort(L)
        merge_sort(R)
        i = j = k = 0
  
        while i < len(L) and j < len(R):
            if L[i] < R[j]:
                arr[k] = L[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = R[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1
  
        while i < len(L):
            arr[k] = L[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1
  
        while j < len(R):
            arr[k] = R[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
```

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst-case time complexity is quite high at O(n^2).

Merge Sort, on the other hand, is a divide and conquer algorithm that splits the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves. The merge() function is used for merging two halves. The time complexity of Merge Sort is O(nLogn) in all 3 cases (worst, average and best) as merge sort always divides the array into two halves and takes linear time to merge two halves. 

In terms of space complexity, Bubble Sort is more efficient as it only requires constant O(1) space, while Merge Sort requires O(n) space due to the recursive nature of the algorithm. 

Therefore, for large data sets, Merge Sort would be a better choice due to its efficiency, but for small data sets or data sets that need to be constantly sorted, Bubble Sort might be a better choice due to its simplicity and lower space complexity.
