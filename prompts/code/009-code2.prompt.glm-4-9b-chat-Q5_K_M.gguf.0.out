To perform a binary search on a file with lines containing names sorted in lexicographical order, you can't directly read the entire file into memory because the file might be too large. Instead, you'll need to read the file line by line, keeping track of the current position and the range of lines you've read so far.

Here's a step-by-step approach to implement the `binary_search_file` function:

1. Open the file and read the first line to get the starting point.
2. Initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to represent the current range of lines you've read. Initially, `low` is 0 and `high` is 1 (since you've read the first line).
3. Calculate the middle index `mid` as the average of `low` and `high`.
4. Read the line at index `mid` and compare it with the target.
5. If the line at `mid` is equal to the target, return the index `mid`.
6. If the line at `mid` is less than the target, update `low` to `mid + 1`.
7. If the line at `mid` is greater than the target, update `high` to `mid - 1`.
8. Repeat steps 3-7 until `low` is greater than `high`.
9. If the target is not found, return the insertion point (as in "bisect_left"), which is `low`.

Here's the Python function implementing the above approach:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    low = 0
    high = 1
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Read the first line to get the starting point
        first_line = file.readline().strip()
        if first_line == target:
            return 0
        elif first_line > target:
            return 0  # The target is before the first line

        # Read the second line if it exists
        second_line = file.readline().strip()
        if second_line == target:
            return 1
        elif second_line < target:
            low = 1
        else:
            high = 1

        # Perform binary search on the file
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            file.seek(0)  # Reset file pointer to the beginning
            for _ in range(mid):
                file.readline()  # Skip lines up to mid
            line = file.readline().strip()
            if line == target:
                return mid
            elif line < target:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid

    # If the target is not found, return the insertion point
    return low

# Example usage:
# position = binary_search_file('names.txt', 'Alice')
# print(position)
```

This function assumes that the file is not empty and that all lines are non-empty. It also assumes that the file is readable and that the names are separated by whitespace. The function uses `file.seek(0)` to reset the file pointer to the beginning before reading each line, which allows us to read the file line by line without loading the entire file into memory.
