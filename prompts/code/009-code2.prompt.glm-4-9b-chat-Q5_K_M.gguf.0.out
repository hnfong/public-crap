Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a file directly, you can't read the entire file into memory, as that would defeat the purpose of using a binary search, which is to handle large datasets efficiently. Instead, you'll need to read the file line by line. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the file and read the first line.
2. Compare the target with the first line.
3. If the target is less than the first line, the target must be in the first half of the file. If the target is greater, it must be in the second half.
4. Close the current file and open the half that contains the target.
5. Repeat the process on the new file, but this time you only need to consider the first half of the new file.
6. Continue this process until you find the target or determine that it's not in the file.

Here's a Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    def search_in_file(file_path, target, start, end):
        if start > end:
            return start  # Insertion point

        mid = (start + end) // 2
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            f.seek(mid * len(target))
            mid_line = f.readline().strip()

        if target == mid_line:
            return mid
        elif target < mid_line:
            return search_in_file(file_path, target, start, mid - 1)
        else:
            return search_in_file(file_path, target, mid + 1, end)

    # Open the file and read the first line to determine the size of the file
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        first_line = f.readline().strip()
        file_size = len(first_line)

    # Perform the binary search
    return search_in_file(file_path, target, 0, file_size - 1)

# Example usage:
# position = binary_search_file('names.txt', 'Alice')
# print(position)
```

This function assumes that each line in the file is the same length as the first line. If the lines are of varying lengths, you would need to adjust the `f.seek(mid * len(target))` line to seek to the correct position in the file. This could be done by reading the file and keeping track of the cumulative lengths of the lines. However, this would complicate the function and potentially increase the time complexity. If the lines are of varying lengths, it might be more efficient to use a different approach, such as keeping the file size in memory or using a database.
