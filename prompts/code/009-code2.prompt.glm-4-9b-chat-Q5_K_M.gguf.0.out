To perform a binary search on a file directly, we need to read the file in chunks and compare the chunks with the target string. Since we are dealing with a text file, we need to consider the encoding of the file and the way the lines are separated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to implement the `binary_search_file` function:

1. Open the file in binary mode to ensure we're reading the bytes correctly.
2. Determine the size of the file to know when to stop reading.
3. Calculate the middle position of the file and read the corresponding chunk.
4. Compare the chunk with the target string.
5. If the chunk is less than the target, discard the lower half of the file and repeat the process on the upper half.
6. If the chunk is greater than the target, discard the upper half of the file and repeat the process on the lower half.
7. If the chunk is equal to the target, return the byte position of the chunk.
8. If the target is not found and we've read the entire file, return the insertion point (byte position where the target would be inserted).

Here's the Python function implementing the above approach:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    def read_chunk(file, position, chunk_size):
        file.seek(position)
        return file.read(chunk_size)

    def find_target_in_chunk(chunk, target):
        chunk_str = chunk.decode('utf-8', errors='ignore')
        lines = chunk_str.splitlines()
        for i, line in enumerate(lines):
            if line.startswith(target):
                return True, i
        return False, None

    chunk_size = 1024  # Adjust chunk size as needed
    file = open(file_path, 'rb')
    file_size = file.tell()  # Get the current position (start of the file)
    low, high = 0, file_size

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        chunk = read_chunk(file, mid, chunk_size)
        found, index = find_target_in_chunk(chunk, target)
        if found:
            # We found the target, now find the exact byte position
            file.seek(mid)
            for _ in range(index):
                file.readline()  # Skip lines until we reach the target line
            return file.tell()  # Return the byte position of the target
        elif index is not None:
            # The target is not in the current chunk, but we know it's in the upper half
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            # The target is not in the current chunk, and we don't know where it is
            high = mid

    file.close()
    return low  # Return the insertion point

# Example usage:
position = binary_search_file("myfile.txt", b"2 by")
print(position)  # Should print 17
```

Please note that this function assumes that the file is encoded in UTF-8 and that the lines are separated by newline characters (`\n`). If the file uses a different encoding or line separator, you will need to adjust the `decode` method and the line splitting accordingly. [end of text]
