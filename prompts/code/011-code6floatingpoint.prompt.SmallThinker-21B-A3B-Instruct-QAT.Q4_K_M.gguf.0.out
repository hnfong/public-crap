### Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```python
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

**Answer:**  
The program will **not** terminate and will **not** produce an output. In Python, `math.inf` is a special floating-point value representing positive infinity. The loop condition `x < math.inf` is always true because `x` is a finite floating-point number (e.g., `0.0`, `1.0`, `2.0`, etc.), and `math.inf` is greater than any finite value. The loop will run indefinitely, and the program will never reach the `print(x)` statement.  

**Final Answer:**  
The program will **not terminate** and **no output** will be produced.

### Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```python
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

**Answer:**  
The program will **not terminate** and **no output** will be produced. Similar to Q1, the loop condition `x < math.inf` is always true because `x` is a finite floating-point number (e.g., `1.0`, `1.001`, `1.002001`, etc.), and `math.inf` is greater than any finite value. The loop will run indefinitely, and the program will never reach the `print(x)` statement.  

**Final Answer:**  
The program will **not terminate** and **no output** will be produced.  
**Is it different from the results above?**  
No, the behavior is the same as in Q1. The loop condition is always true, and the program does not terminate.

### Q3. Consider the following program:

```python
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

**Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.**

**Answer:**  
Yes, there are inputs that will lead to the output "Done". The loop will terminate if the value of `x` eventually reaches `math.inf`. However, in IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic, `math.inf` is a special value that cannot be reached by finite additions. But if the input `inc` is **negative**, the loop will terminate immediately because `x` starts at `0.0` and is incremented by a negative value, making `x` negative. In this case, the loop condition `x < math.inf` is false, and the program prints "Done".  

**Examples of such inputs:**  
1. `inc = -1.0`  
   - `x` becomes `-1.0`, `-2.0`, etc., and the loop terminates.  
2. `inc = -0.5`  
   - `x` becomes `-0.5`, `-1.0`, etc., and the loop terminates.  

**Final Answer:**  
Yes, inputs like `inc = -1.0` or `inc = -0.5` will lead to the output "Done". [end of text]
