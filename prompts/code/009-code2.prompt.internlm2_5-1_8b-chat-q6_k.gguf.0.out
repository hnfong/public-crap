Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

Here is a Python function that performs a binary search on a file and returns the position of the target, or the insertion point:

```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        names = [line.strip() for line in file]

    # Sort the names in lexicographical order
    names.sort()

    # Perform binary search
    position = bisect.bisect_left(names, target)

    return position
```

In this function, we first open the file and read all the lines into a list of names. We then sort the names in lexicographical order using the `sort()` method.

Next, we use the `bisect_left()` function from the `bisect` module to perform a binary search on the names list. The `bisect_left()` function returns the insertion point for the target element in the list, or the position where the target element would be inserted if it were already in the list.

Finally, we return the position of the target element.

Note that this implementation assumes that the names in the file are sorted in lexicographical order. If the names are not sorted, the `sort()` method will not be necessary. [end of text]
