 Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Remember to answer all the questions

Q1.
  The eventual output of the following Python program:

```python
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

is `inf`.

Explanation:
- The variable `x` is initialized to `0.0`.
- The loop condition `x < math.inf` will always be true because `x` starts at `0.0` and `1.0` is added to `x` in each iteration.
- In IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic, adding `1.0` to `x` will eventually cause `x` to exceed the maximum finite value representable by a floating-point number, at which point `x` will become `inf`.
- The loop will terminate when `x` becomes `inf`, and the program will print `inf`.

Q2.
The eventual output of the following Python program:

```python
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

is also `inf`.

Explanation:
- The variable `x` is initialized to `1.0`.
- The loop condition `x < math.inf` will always be true because `x` starts at `1.0` and is multiplied by `1.001` in each iteration.
- In IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic, multiplying `x` by `1.001` will eventually cause `x` to exceed the maximum finite value representable by a floating-point number, at which point `x` will become `inf`.
- The loop will terminate when `x` becomes `inf`, and the program will print `inf`.

The results are the same as in Q1 because in both cases, the operations performed on `x` will eventually cause it to exceed the maximum finite value representable by a floating-point number, resulting in `inf`.

Q3.
Consider the following program:

```python
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

There are inputs that will lead to the output "Done". However, the program will not terminate for most inputs because `x` will eventually become `inf` due to the nature of floating-point arithmetic. Here are two examples of inputs that will lead to the output "Done":

1. **Input: `0.0`**
   - If `inc` is `0.0`, `x` will remain `0.0` in each iteration, and the loop condition `x < math.inf` will always be true. The loop will never terminate, and the program will not print "Done".

2. **Input: `NaN` (Not a Number)**
   - If `inc` is `NaN`, the addition `x += inc` will result in `x` becoming `NaN` on the first iteration. The loop condition `x < math.inf` will be false because `NaN` is not less than `inf`, and the loop will terminate immediately. The program will print "Done".

For most other inputs, the loop will continue indefinitely because `x` will eventually become `inf`, and the loop condition will be false, but the program will not print "Done" because the loop will not terminate. [end of text]
