x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)

The program uses a `while` loop to repeatedly add 1.0 to the variable `x` until it becomes equal to positive infinity. However, in Python, floating-point numbers have a limited precision, and they cannot represent infinity directly. As a result, the loop will continue indefinitely without changing the value of `x`. Eventually, the program will need to be terminated manually.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>
