Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

The given program will print "Done" only if the loop `while x < math.inf:` terminates. This loop will only terminate if `inc` is a negative number or zero, because adding a negative number or zero to `x` will not make `x` approach infinity.

Here are two examples of inputs that will lead to the output "Done":

1. **Input: -1**
   - With `inc` set to -1, `x` will decrease with each iteration, eventually causing the loop to terminate.

2. **Input: 0**
   - With `inc` set to 0, `x` will remain 0 throughout the loop, and the loop will terminate immediately since `x` is not less than `math.inf`.

Here is the modified program with comments for clarity:

```python
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

For both inputs (-1 and 0), the loop will terminate, and the program will print "Done".
