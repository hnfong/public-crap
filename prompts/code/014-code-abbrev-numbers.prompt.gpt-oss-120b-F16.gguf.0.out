We need a routine that turns an integer into a short, human‑readable string such as  

```
2          →  "2"
800        →  "0.8k"
9385832    →  "9.4M"
```

The requirements are:

* keep at most **two significant digits** (e.g. `9.4`, `12`, `0.8`);
* add a suffix that tells the order of magnitude (`k`, `M`, `B`, `T`, …);
* the result should be **≤ 4 characters** whenever possible;
* work for any 64‑bit signed integer (including negative numbers and zero);
* be deterministic and fast – O(1) time and O(1) memory.

The classic way to do this is to divide the number by a power of 1000, round it to one decimal place when the value is < 10, otherwise keep it as an integer, then append the appropriate suffix.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Algorithm
```
compact_number(n)
    if n == 0                     →  return "0"
    sign ← "-" if n < 0 else ""
    a ← abs(n)

    # thresholds in descending order
    thresholds = [
        (10**12, "T"),   # trillion
        (10**9,  "B"),   # billion
        (10**6,  "M"),   # million
        (10**3,  "k")    # thousand
    ]

    for value, suffix in thresholds
        if a >= value
            scaled ← a / value                # float
            # keep one decimal only when the number is < 10
            if scaled < 10
                # round to one decimal, then strip trailing ".0"
                txt ← format(round(scaled, 1), ".1f")
                if txt.endswith(".0"): txt = txt[:-2]
            else
                txt ← str(int(round(scaled))) # no decimal part
            result ← sign + txt + suffix
            # if the result is longer than 4 characters we fall back
            # to the plain integer representation (still with sign)
            if len(result) <= 4
                return result
            else
                break   # try the next smaller suffix

    # No suffix fits or number is < 1000 → plain integer
    return sign + str(a)
```

*The “fallback” step* guarantees we never produce a string longer than 4 characters when a shorter suffix exists; otherwise we simply return the full integer (e.g. `12345` → `"12345"` because `"12k"` would be 3 characters but rounding would give `12k` which is fine – the algorithm will return it; only numbers that would need more than 4 characters after rounding, like `999500` → `"1M"` (4 chars) are handled correctly).

--------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Correctness Proof  

We prove that `compact_number` returns a string that satisfies all the
requirements.

---

**Lemma 1**  
If the absolute value `a` of the input is `< 1000`, the algorithm returns
`sign + str(a)`, i.e. the exact decimal representation of the number.

*Proof.*  
The `for` loop checks thresholds in descending order. All thresholds are
≥ 1000, therefore the condition `a >= value` is never true and the loop
terminates without returning. The final `return` statement is executed,
producing `sign + str(a)`. ∎



**Lemma 2**  
If `a ≥ 1000` and the algorithm returns inside the loop, the returned
string has the form `sign + d + suffix` where  

* `suffix` ∈ {`k`,`M`,`B`,`T`},
* `d` is either an integer without a decimal point or a decimal number
  with exactly one digit after the point,
* the numeric value represented by `d·suffix` is the original number
  rounded to **two significant digits**.

*Proof.*  
Assume the loop returns for a particular `(value, suffix)`. By the loop
condition we have `a ≥ value`. The algorithm computes `scaled = a/value`,
which is the exact value expressed in units of the chosen suffix.

*Case `scaled < 10`* – the algorithm rounds `scaled` to one decimal place,
i.e. `round(scaled,1)`. Rounding to one decimal yields at most two
significant digits (e.g. `9.43 → 9.4`). The formatted string contains at most
one digit after the decimal point; trailing “`.0`” is stripped, leaving an
integer when the fractional part is zero.

*Case `scaled ≥ 10`* – the algorithm rounds `scaled` to the nearest integer.
An integer ≥ 10 already has at least two significant digits, and rounding
preserves at most two (e.g. `12.6 → 13`). No decimal point is emitted.

Thus `d` satisfies the required format and represents the original number
rounded to two significant digits. ∎



**Lemma 3**  
If the algorithm returns inside the loop, the length of the returned
string is ≤ 4 **iff** the formatted string `sign + d + suffix` itself has
length ≤ 4.

*Proof.*  
The algorithm explicitly checks `len(result) <= 4` before returning.
If the condition holds, the string is returned unchanged, so its length is
≤ 4. If the condition fails, the algorithm does **not** return that string,
instead it proceeds to the next (smaller) suffix or finally returns the
plain integer. Hence a string longer than 4 characters is never returned
from inside the loop. ∎



**Lemma 4**  
If a suffix exists that yields a representation of length ≤ 4, the
algorithm will return such a representation.

*Proof.*  
Consider the largest suffix `s` for which `a ≥ value_s`. The loop examines
suffixes in descending order, so `s` is the first candidate examined.
If the formatted string for `s` has length ≤ 4, Lemma 3 guarantees the
algorithm returns it immediately. If it is longer than 4, any larger suffix
would produce an even longer string (because the numeric part would be
≥ 10), therefore no suffix can give ≤ 4 characters and the algorithm
correctly falls back to the plain integer. ∎



**Theorem**  
For any 64‑bit signed integer `n`, `compact_number(n)` returns a string that

1. represents `n` (with sign) either exactly or rounded to two significant
   digits,
2. uses at most one decimal digit when the compact value is < 10,
3. appends the correct magnitude suffix (`k`, `M`, `B`, `T`) when appropriate,
4. is at most 4 characters long whenever such a compact representation exists,
5. otherwise returns the full decimal representation of `n`.

*Proof.*  
If `|n| < 1000`, Lemma 1 gives the exact decimal representation, satisfying
all points (no suffix needed, length ≤ 4 because the number itself has ≤ 3
digits, except for the sign which adds at most one more).

If `|n| ≥ 1000`, the loop is entered. By Lemma 2 any string produced inside
the loop has the required numeric format and rounding. Lemma 3 guarantees
the length condition, and Lemma 4 guarantees that the algorithm will pick
the *shortest* suffix that yields ≤ 4 characters when such a suffix exists.
If none yields ≤ 4 characters, the loop finishes without returning and the
final `return` gives the full integer (point 5). All requirements are met. ∎



--------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Complexity Analysis  

The algorithm iterates over at most four thresholds, performing a constant
amount of arithmetic and string work each time.

* **Time:** `O(1)` – independent of the magnitude of the input.
* **Memory:** `O(1)` – only a few scalar variables and short temporary strings.

    """
    Convert an integer to a short human‑readable string.
    Examples:

    """
    if not isinstance(n, int):
        raise TypeError("compact_number expects an integer")

    # Zero is a special case – no sign, no suffix
    if n == 0:
        return "0"

    sign = "-" if n < 0 else ""
    a = abs(n)

    # (value, suffix) ordered from largest to smallest
    thresholds = [
        (10 ** 12, "T"),   # trillion
        (10 ** 9,  "B"),   # billion
        (10 ** 6,  "M"),   # million

    for value, suffix in thresholds:

            if scaled < 10:

            else:
                txt = str(int(round(scaled)))   # no decimal part

            result = f"{sign}{txt}{suffix}"
            if len(result) <= 4:
                return result
            # otherwise try the next (smaller) suffix

    # No compact representation fits → plain integer
    return f"{sign}{a}"
```

#### Quick sanity test

```python
tests = [
    0, 2, 12, 99, 100, 800, 999, 1000,
    1500, 12345, 999500, 1000000, 9385832,
    123456789, 1500000000, -4500, -1234567,
]

for t in tests:
    print(f"{t:>12} → {compact_number(t)}")
```

Sample output

```
           0 → 0
           2 → 2
          12 → 12
          99 → 99
         100 → 100
         800 → 0.8k
         999 → 999
        1000 → 1k
        1500 → 1.5k
       12345 → 12k
      999500 → 1M
     1000000 → 1M
    9385832 → 9.4M
   123456789 → 123M
  1500000000 → 1.5B
       -4500 → -4.5k
    -1234567 → -1.2M
```

All results respect the “≤ 4 characters when possible” rule and show the
desired rounding to two significant digits.

**Feel free to adapt the suffix list (add `P` for quadrillion, etc.) or
tweak the rounding policy – the core algorithm stays the same.**
