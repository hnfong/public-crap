 What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
 The output of the given Python program is:

inf

Explanation:
The program initializes the variable x with a value of 1.0. Then, it enters a while loop that continues as long as x is less than infinity (math.inf). Inside the loop, x is multiplied by 1.001 in each iteration.

Since 1.001 is greater than 1, the value of x will keep increasing in each iteration. Eventually, x will become so large that it exceeds the maximum value that can be represented by a float in Python, which is approximately 1.8e308. At this point, x will be assigned the value of infinity (math.inf).

When the loop condition (x < math.inf) is no longer satisfied, the loop terminates, and the program prints the value of x, which is now infinity (inf).
