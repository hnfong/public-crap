**Q1.**  
The loop adds 1.0 to `x` until `x` becomes infinite.  
In IEEE-754, once `x` reaches the largest finite representable value (≈ 1.7976931348623157×10³⁰⁸), the next addition overflows to `+inf`.  
Therefore the program prints:

```
inf
```

---

**Q2.**  
The loop multiplies `x` by 1.001 until `x` becomes infinite.  
Because 1.001 > 1, the value grows exponentially; after about 1,103 iterations it overflows to `+inf`.  
Thus the program also prints:

```
inf
```

It is **not different** from Q1; both eventually produce `inf`.

---

**Q3.**  
Yes. Any non-zero finite `inc` will eventually cause `x` to overflow to `+inf`, so the loop terminates and "Done" is printed.

Examples:
- `inc = 1.0` (as in Q1)
- `inc = 0.1` (smaller step, but still finite) [end of text]
