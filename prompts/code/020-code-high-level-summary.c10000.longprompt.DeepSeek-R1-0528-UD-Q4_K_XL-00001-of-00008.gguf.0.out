We are given a source code file that is part of a dictionary application. The main purpose of this file is to handle the parsing, validation, and representation of dictionary entries (definitions) and their components (such as examples, pronunciations, and tags). 

At a high level, the code does the following:

1. **Tag Handling**: It defines a system for tagging dictionary entries with metadata. Tags include things like part of speech (e.g., noun, verb), labels (e.g., slang, vulgar), synonyms, antonyms, reference links, and image links. The code provides aliases for these tags (e.g., "詞性" is an alias for "pos") and ensures that only recognized tags are used.

2. **Definition Parsing**: It parses a string that represents a dictionary entry (a definition) into a structured format. The definition string is expected to contain tags (like `(pos:名詞)`) and one or more explanations. The parser extracts the tags and splits the explanations into individual items.

3. **Multilingual Support**: The code supports multiple languages for explanations and examples. Each explanation or example can be provided in several languages (like Cantonese, English, etc.). The system can parse and serialize these multilingual components.

4. **Validation**: It includes validation for the tags and the structure of the input. For example, it checks that required tags (like part of speech) are present and that the values for certain tags (like URLs for references and images) are in the correct format.

5. **Serialization and JSON Conversion**: The parsed definitions and their components can be converted back to a string format (serialization) or to a JSON structure for easier data interchange.

6. **Pronunciation Handling**: The code can parse and generate representations of written words along with their pronunciations (in Jyutping, a romanization system for Cantonese). It also includes functionality to automatically generate pronunciations for words when not provided.

7. **Formatting for Display**: It provides functions to format explanations and examples for web display, including creating hyperlinks for terms that are present in the dictionary (using a `#term` syntax) and handling ruby text (annotations for pronunciation).

8. **Error Handling**: The code defines custom exceptions for various error conditions (like ambiguous pronunciations, invalid tags, missing items) to provide meaningful feedback.

9. **Utility Functions**: It includes helper functions for language detection, part-of-speech mapping, and label validation.

In summary, this file is a core component of a Cantonese dictionary system that processes and structures dictionary entries, ensuring they are correctly tagged, validated, and formatted for display or further processing. It handles multilingual content and pronunciations, and it provides mechanisms to convert between different representations (text, structured objects, JSON).

This file provides the core functionality for a multilingual Cantonese dictionary system. At a high level, it handles:

1. **Dictionary Entry Processing**:  
- Parses and structures dictionary definitions from text input  
- Extracts metadata tags (like part-of-speech, labels, synonyms)  
- Supports multiple languages for definitions and examples  

2. **Content Validation**:  
- Enforces required tags and valid values for dictionary entries  
- Checks pronunciation validity using Jyutping romanization  
- Detects illegal characters and formatting errors  

3. **Multilingual Support**:  
- Handles translations for definitions and example sentences  
- Supports Cantonese, English, and other languages  
- Automatically detects languages in mixed-content entries  

4. **Data Transformation**:  
- Converts dictionary entries between different formats:  
  - Human-readable text  
  - Structured JSON  
  - HTML for web display  
- Generates pronunciation annotations (ruby text) for Chinese characters  

5. **Utility Functions**:  
- Automatically generates pronunciations for Chinese words  
- Creates hyperlinks between related dictionary entries  
- Provides shortcuts for common grammatical terms and labels  

The system serves as the backbone for dictionary operations, enabling creation, validation, and display of entries while handling the complexities of Cantonese language features and multilingual content. [end of text]
