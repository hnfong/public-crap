To perform a binary search on a file directly, we need to read the file in chunks rather than loading the entire file into memory. This approach ensures that we only use \(O(\log(n))\) operations, where \(n\) is the number of lines in the file.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to achieve this:

1. **Determine the File Size**: First, we need to know the size of the file to calculate the midpoints for the binary search.
2. **Read the Midpoint**: For each iteration of the binary search, we need to read the line that is at the midpoint of the current search range.
3. **Compare the Target**: Compare the target with the midpoint line to decide whether to search in the left or right half of the file.
4. **Repeat**: Continue this process until the target is found or the search range is reduced to zero.

Here is the Python function `binary_search_file` that implements this logic:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        file_size = file.seek(0, 2)  # Get the size of the file
        file.seek(0)  # Reset the file pointer to the beginning

        low, high = 0, file_size

        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            file.seek(mid)
            file.readline()  # Move to the start of the next line
            mid_line = file.readline()

            if not mid_line:
                high = mid
            elif mid_line < target:
                low = file.tell()
            elif mid_line > target:
                high = mid
            else:
                return file.tell() - len(mid_line)

        return low

# Example usage:
# Assuming the file "myfile.txt" contains the lines as specified in the example
# result = binary_search_file("myfile.txt", b"2 by")
# print(result)  # Should print the byte position of "2 by"
```

### Explanation:

1. **File Size Calculation**: `file.seek(0, 2)` moves the file pointer to the end of the file, and `file.tell()` returns the current position, which is the file size.
2. **Binary Search Loop**: The loop continues until `low` is no longer less than `high`.
3. **Midpoint Calculation**: `mid = (low + high) // 2` calculates the midpoint.
4. **Reading the Midpoint Line**: `file.seek(mid)` moves the file pointer to the midpoint. `file.readline()` reads the current line (which might be incomplete if `mid` is in the middle of a line) and then reads the next complete line.
5. **Comparison**: The midpoint line is compared with the target. If it's less, we search in the right half; if it's greater, we search in the left half.
6. **Return Value**: If the target is found, the function returns the byte position of the target. If not, it returns the insertion point.

This function ensures that we only read necessary parts of the file, making it efficient for large files. [end of text]
