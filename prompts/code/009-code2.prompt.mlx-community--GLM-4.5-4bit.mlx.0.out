==========
To perform a binary search on a text file with lexicographically sorted names, we need to efficiently navigate the file without loading all its contents into memory. The key challenge is to access arbitrary lines in the file with O(1) time complexity, which is typically not possible with standard file operations. However, we can approximate this by using file seeking and line counting.

### Approach
1. **File Size Estimation**: Determine the total number of lines in the file. This can be done by reading the file once and counting the lines, but this is O(n) and not acceptable for large files. Instead, we can use binary search on the file's byte offsets to estimate the number of lines.
2. **Binary Search on Lines**: Perform a binary search on the lines of the file by:
   - **Seeking to a Midpoint**: Calculate a midpoint in the file based on byte offsets, then adjust to the start of the nearest line.
   - **Reading the Line**: Read the line at the adjusted midpoint.
   - **Comparison**: Compare the line with the target to determine whether to search the left or right half of the file.
3. **Adjusting Search Space**: Adjust the search space (low and high byte offsets) based on the comparison until the target is found or the search space is exhausted.

### Solution Code
```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Helper function to get the line at a given byte offset
        def get_line_at_offset(offset):
            file.seek(offset)
            if offset > 0:
                # Move to the start of the line if not at the beginning
                file.readline()  # discard partial line
            return file.readline().strip()
        
        low = 0
        # Get the file size to set the initial high
        file.seek(0, 2)  # move to end of file
        high = file.tell()  # get file size in bytes
        
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            line = get_line_at_offset(mid)
            if not line:  # EOF or empty line
                high = mid
                continue
            if line < target:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
        
        # After loop, low is the insertion point
        # Now, find the line number (position) of low
        # We need to count how many lines are before low
        file.seek(0)
        line_count = 0
        current_pos = 0
        while current_pos < low:
            line = file.readline()
            if not line:
                break
            current_pos = file.tell()
            line_count += 1
        
        # Check if the line at low is the target
        file.seek(low)
        if low > 0:
            file.readline()  # discard partial line
        line = file.readline().strip()
        if line == target:
            return line_count
        else:
            return line_count  # insertion point
```

### Explanation
1. **Helper Function `get_line_at_offset`**: This function seeks to a given byte offset in the file, adjusts to the start of the next line (if not at the beginning), and reads the line. This ensures we always read complete lines.
2. **Binary Search Setup**: The binary search is initialized with `low` at 0 and `high` at the end of the file. The loop continues until `low` and `high` converge.
3. **Midpoint Calculation**: For each midpoint, the line is read and compared with the target. If the line is less than the target, the search moves to the right half; otherwise, it moves to the left half.
4. **Finding Insertion Point**: After the loop, `low` points to the byte offset where the target should be inserted. The code then counts the number of lines before this offset to determine the line number (position) of the insertion point.
5. **Target Check**: The line at the insertion point is checked against the target. If it matches, the line number is returned; otherwise, the insertion point (line number) is returned.

This approach efficiently narrows down the search space using binary search on byte offsets, ensuring O(log n) operations while minimizing file reads. The final line count step ensures the correct position is returned, whether the target is found or not.
