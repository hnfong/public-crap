To perform a binary search on a file, we need to read the file into memory and then perform the search. However, since the file is sorted in lexicographical order, we can use a binary search algorithm to find the target string.

Here's a Python function that does this:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()

    low = 0
    high = len(lines) - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        mid_line = lines[mid].decode('utf-8').strip()
        mid_line_bytes = mid_line.encode('utf-8')

        if mid_line_bytes == target:
            return mid * (len(lines[0]) + 1)  # return the position of the target
        elif mid_line_bytes < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    return low  # return the insertion point
```

Here's an explanation of the code:

1. We open the file in binary mode (`'rb'`) and read all lines into memory using `readlines()`.
2. We initialize the `low` and `high` variables to the start and end of the list of lines, respectively.
3. We enter a while loop that continues until `low` is greater than `high`.
4. In each iteration, we calculate the middle index `mid` using the formula `(low + high) // 2`.
5. We decode the middle line from bytes to a string using `decode('utf-8')` and strip any trailing newlines using `strip()`.
6. We encode the middle line back to bytes using `encode('utf-8')` to compare it with the target.
7. If the middle line matches the target, we return the position of the target by multiplying the middle index by the length of each line plus one (to account for the newline character).
8. If the middle line is less than the target, we update `low` to `mid + 1`.
9. If the middle line is greater than the target, we update `high` to `mid - 1`.
10. If the loop ends without finding the target, we return the insertion point, which is the value of `low`.

Note that this implementation assumes that the file is sorted in lexicographical order and that the target is a substring of a line in the file. If the file is not sorted or the target is not a substring of a line, the function may not work correctly.

Also, keep in mind that reading the entire file into memory may not be suitable for large files. In that case, you may want to consider using a more memory-efficient approach, such as reading the file line by line and using a binary search algorithm on the lines as you read them. [end of text]
