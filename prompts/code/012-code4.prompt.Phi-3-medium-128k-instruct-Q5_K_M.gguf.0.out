 What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
 The eventual output of the given Python program is `inf`.

Explanation:
The program initializes a variable `x` with the value `0.0`. Then, it enters a while loop that continues as long as `x` is less than `math.inf`. Inside the loop, `x` is incremented by `1.0` in each iteration.

Since `math.inf` is a special floating-point value that represents infinity, the loop will never terminate because `x` will never reach `math.inf`. Therefore, the loop will keep incrementing `x` indefinitely.

Finally, when the loop exits, the program prints the value of `x`, which is `inf`.
