**Q1.**  
The loop adds 1.0 to `x` until `x` would become `inf`.  
Because `float` in Python is IEEE-754 double-precision, the largest finite value is  
`1.7976931348623157e+308`.  
Adding 1.0 to that value still yields `inf`, so the loop stops **before** the addition that would overflow.  
Therefore the program prints:

```
1.7976931348623157e+308
```

**Q2.**  
`x` starts at 1.0 and is multiplied by 1.001 each iteration.  
Because 1.001 > 1, the value grows without bound, but it does so **gradually**.  
The loop condition `x < math.inf` is true for every finite `x`, so the loop never terminates.  
The program therefore runs forever and never prints anything.

This is different from Q1: there the loop stops after a finite number of steps, whereas here it runs indefinitely.

**Q3.**  
The loop adds `inc` to `x` until `x` becomes `inf`.  
If `inc` is **positive**, the loop will eventually reach `inf` (after `inf/inc` iterations), so the program will **not** print “Done”.  
If `inc` is **zero**, `x` never changes and the loop runs forever.  
If `inc` is **negative**, `x` decreases and the loop also runs forever.

Hence **no positive finite input** will cause the program to print “Done”.  
The only way to see “Done” is to supply an input that makes the loop body **never execute**, i.e. an input that is **not positive**.  
For example:

- `inc = 0.0`  
- `inc = -1.0`

Both satisfy the requirement. [end of text]
