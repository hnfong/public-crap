User: Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.


Assistant: 1) If a user enters `0.1`, the loop will continue indefinitely because `x` is incremented by `0.1` in each iteration of the loop. Therefore, there is no stopping condition, so the output will be "Done".

2) If a user enters `1000000`, the loop will also continue indefinitely because `x` is incremented by `1000000` in each iteration of the loop. Again, there is no stopping condition, so the output will be "Done".
