Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

Binary search works on the principle of divide and conquer. It works on the assumption that the list or array is sorted. Binary search works by repeatedly dividing the sorted list in half. If the target value is less than the item in the middle of the list, then the left half of the list is updated to the left half, and the middle value is discarded. If the target value is greater than the item in the middle of the list, then the right half of the list is updated to the right half, and the middle value is discarded. This process continues until the target value is found or the list is empty.

To perform binary search on a file, we can read the file line by line. Each line is a name sorted in lexicographical order. The first name in the file is the smallest name in the list. We can use binary search to find the position of the target name in the list. We can read the first name in the file and compare it with the target name. If they are equal, we return the position. If the target name is less than the first name, we need to perform binary search on the right half of the list. If the target name is greater than the first name, we need to perform binary search on the left half of the list. We can continue this process until the target name is found or the list is empty.

Here is a Python function that performs binary search on a file:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    names = []
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        for line in f:
            names.append(line.strip())
    names.sort()
    left, right = 0, len(names) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if names[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif names[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return left
```

In this function, we first read the file and store the names in a list. We sort the list in ascending order. Then we initialize the left and right pointers to 0 and the length of the list minus 1, respectively. We enter a while loop that continues until the left pointer is greater than the right pointer. Inside the loop, we calculate the middle index as the average of the left and right pointers. If the name at the middle index is equal to the target name, we return the middle index. If the name at the middle index is less than the target name, we update the left pointer to the middle index plus 1. If the name at the middle index is greater than the target name, we update the right pointer to the middle index minus 1. After the loop ends, if the target name is not found in the list, we return the value of the left pointer, which is the insertion point.
