This source code file appears to be a Python implementation of a multilingual dictionary and explanation system. The primary functionality of the code is to parse and generate explanations in multiple languages, including English, Chinese, and other languages. The code uses a combination of regular expressions, string manipulation, and a dictionary of language-specific rules to achieve this.

### Key Components of the Code

1. **Definition Class:** This class represents a single explanation or example in a multilingual context. It has methods to serialize the explanation and generate HTML output.

2. **Example Class:** This class represents a single example sentence in a multilingual context. It has methods to serialize the example and generate HTML output.

3. **Explanation Class:** This class represents a single explanation in a multilingual context. It has methods to serialize the explanation and generate HTML output.

4. **MultilingualFormat Class:** This class is a base class for multilingual examples and explanations. It provides a common interface for parsing and generating multilingual content.

5. **Example and Explanation Serialization:** These methods serialize the explanation and example into a JSON-like format that can be easily converted to and from JSON.

6. **MultilingualExample and MultilingualExplanation:** These classes represent a single explanation or example in a multilingual context. They provide methods to serialize the explanation and generate HTML output.

7. **MultilingualFormat:** This class is a base class for multilingual examples and explanations. It provides a common interface for parsing and generating multilingual content.

8. **Example and Explanation Serialization:** These methods serialize the explanation and example into a JSON-like format that can be easily converted to and from JSON.

9. **MultilingualFormat:** This class is a base class for multilingual examples and explanations. It provides a common interface for parsing and generating multilingual content.

### High-Level Functionality

1. **Parsing:** The code uses regular expressions to parse the input text and extract the language and content of each example or explanation.

2. **Generating:** The code generates HTML output by converting the parsed content into a multilingual format. It uses the `MultilingualFormat` class to handle the translation and formatting of the content.

3. **Serialization:** The code serializes the explanation and example into a JSON-like format that can be easily converted to and from JSON.

4. **HTML Output:** The code generates HTML output by converting the serialized content into a multilingual format. It uses the `MultilingualFormat` class to handle the translation and formatting of the content.

### Example Usage

1. **Loading the Dictionary:** The code uses a dictionary of language-specific rules to handle the translation of the input text.

2. **Generating Explanations:** The code generates explanations in multiple languages by parsing the input text and extracting the language and content of each example or explanation.

3. **Generating HTML Output:** The code generates HTML output by converting the parsed content into a multilingual format. It uses the `MultilingualFormat` class to handle the translation and formatting of the content.

### Implementation Details

- **Regular Expressions:** The code uses regular expressions to parse the input text and extract the language and content of each example or explanation.

- **Language Specific Rules:** The code uses language-specific rules to handle the translation of the input text. This includes rules for handling jyutping, cjk characters, and other language-specific features.

- **Multilingual Format:** The code uses the `MultilingualFormat` class to handle the translation and formatting of the input text. This class provides a common interface for parsing and generating multilingual content.

- **Serialization:** The code uses the `json` module to serialize the explanation and example into a JSON-like format that can be easily converted to and from JSON.

- **HTML Output:** The code generates HTML output by converting the serialized content into a multilingual format. It uses the `MultilingualFormat` class to handle the translation and formatting of the content.
