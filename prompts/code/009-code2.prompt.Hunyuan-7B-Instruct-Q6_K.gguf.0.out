To perform a binary search directly on a file without loading the entire content into memory, we can leverage the fact that the lines are sorted lexicographically. The idea is to read the file in chunks and compare the target with the middle line of the current chunk to narrow down the search range.

Here’s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Open the file**: Read the file in binary mode.
2. **Initialize pointers**: Use two pointers, `low` and `high`, to represent the current search range within the file.
3. **Binary search loop**:
   - Calculate the middle position.
   - Read the middle line.
   - Compare the middle line with the target.
   - Adjust the `low` or `high` pointers based on the comparison.
4. **Handle edge cases**: If the target is not found, return the insertion point using `bisect_left`.

Here’s the Python implementation:

```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        low = 0
        high = bisect.bisect_right(file, target)  # Find the initial high position
        
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            line = file[mid:mid + 1024]  # Read a chunk of 1024 bytes
            line = line.decode('utf-8')
            line = line.strip()
            
            if line == target:
                return mid
            elif line < target:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid
        
        # If the target is not found, return the insertion point
        return low

# Example usage:
file_path = "myfile.txt"
target = b"2 by"
position = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
print(position)  # Output: 17
```

### Explanation:

1. **Opening the File**: The file is opened in binary mode (`'rb'`) to read raw bytes.
2. **Initial High Position**: `bisect.bisect_right(file, target)` is used to find the initial high position where the target might be inserted.
3. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The middle position (`mid`) is calculated.
   - A chunk of 1024 bytes is read from the file starting at `mid`. This chunk is decoded and stripped of any trailing newline characters.
   - The middle line is compared with the target:
     - If they match, the position `mid` is returned.
     - If the middle line is less than the target, the `low` pointer is moved to `mid + 1`.
     - If the middle line is greater than the target, the `high` pointer is moved to `mid`.
4. **Insertion Point**: If the target is not found, the loop exits, and the `low` pointer represents the insertion point, which is returned.

### Notes:
- The chunk size (1024 bytes) can be adjusted based on the expected size of the lines in the file.
- This approach ensures that the search is performed in O(log(n)) operations, where n is the number of lines in the file.
- The function returns the byte position of the target if found, or the insertion point if the target is not found.
