**Explanation:**

1.  **HTML Structure:** We create a basic HTML table with a `<table>` tag.  The `<table>` tag is the standard way to create a table in HTML.
2.  **JavaScript:** We use JavaScript to create a simple table.  The `id` attribute is used to identify the table element.
3.  **Table Rendering:**  The `innerHTML` attribute is used to display the table.  The `id` attribute is used to identify the table element.
4.  **Table Rendering:**  The `<table>` tag is then rendered, and the `<thead>` and `<tbody>` tags are used to structure the table.
