**Q1.** What (if any) is the eventual output of the following Python program?

```python
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

**Answer:**  
The program will **not terminate** and will run indefinitely. Here's why:

- The variable `x` starts at `0.0`.
- In each iteration of the loop, `x` is incremented by `1.0`.
- The loop condition is `x < math.inf`, which is always true because `math.inf` represents positive infinity.
- Since `x` is a floating-point number and the loop condition is always true, the loop will continue to run forever.
- Therefore, the `print(x)` statement will **never be executed**, and the program will **not output anything**.

**Output:** **No output (the program runs indefinitely).**

**Q2.** What (if any) is the eventual output of the following Python program? Is it different from the results above?

```python
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

**Answer:**  
This program will **also not terminate** and will run indefinitely. Here's why:

- The variable `x` starts at `1.0`.
- In each iteration, `x` is multiplied by `1.001`, which increases its value.
- The loop condition `x < math.inf` is always true because `math.inf` is positive infinity.
- Since `x` is a floating-point number and the loop condition is always true, the loop will continue to run forever.
- Therefore, the `print(x)` statement will **never be executed**, and the program will **not output anything**.

**Output:** **No output (the program runs indefinitely).**

**Note:** The output is **the same** as in Q1 — the program does not terminate and does not print anything.

**Q3.** Consider the following program:

```python
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

**Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.**

**Answer:**  
Yes, there are inputs that will lead to the output `"Done"`. The program will terminate when the loop condition `x < math.inf` becomes false. This can happen if `inc` is **negative** or **zero**, because then `x` will either stay the same or decrease, eventually making the loop condition false.

### Examples of valid inputs:

1. **Input: `0.0`**  
   - `inc = 0.0`  
   - In each iteration, `x += 0.0` does not change the value of `x`.  
   - So `x` remains `0.0`, and the loop condition `x < math.inf` is always true.  
   - **Wait — this would still run indefinitely.**  
   - **Correction:** If `inc = 0.0`, the loop will **not terminate** because `x` is always `0.0`, and `0.0 < math.inf` is true.  
   - So this input **does not** lead to the output `"Done"`.

2. **Input: `-1.0`**  
   - `inc = -1.0`  
   - In each iteration, `x` decreases by 1.0.  
   - Eventually, `x` will become negative and the loop condition `x < math.inf` will still be true.  
   - However, the loop will **not terminate** because `x` will never reach `math.inf`.  
   - So this input **also does not** lead to the output `"Done"`.

### Correct examples that **do** lead to the output `"Done"`:

1. **Input: `-1.0`**  
   - Wait — this is the same as above. Let's correct this.

   **Correct example 1:**  
   - **Input: `-1.0`**  
   - `x` starts at `0.0`.  
   - In each iteration, `x` decreases by 1.0.  
   - After 1 iteration: `x = -1.0`  
   - After 2 iterations: `x = -2.0`  
   - This will continue indefinitely, so the loop will **not terminate**.

   **Correct example 2:**  
   - **Input: `0.0`**  
   - As discussed, this will not terminate.

   **Correct example 3:**  
   - **Input: `-1.0`**  
   - This is the same as above.

   **Correct example 4:**  
   - **Input: `-1.0`**  
   - This is the same as above.

   **Wait — this is not working. Let's think again.**

   The loop will **only terminate** if `x` becomes **greater than or equal to `math.inf`**, which is **not possible** with a finite `inc`. So the loop **will never terminate**.

   **Conclusion:**  
   The loop will **never terminate** because `x` is a floating-point number and `math.inf` is positive infinity. The loop condition `x < math.inf` is always true, so the loop will run forever.

   **Therefore, there is **no** input that will lead to the output `"Done"`.**

   **Final Answer:**  
   No, there are **no inputs** that will lead to the output `"Done"`. The loop will always run indefinitely because `x < math.inf` is always true. [end of text]
