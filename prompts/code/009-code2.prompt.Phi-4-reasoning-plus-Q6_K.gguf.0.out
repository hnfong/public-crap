We are asked: "Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function def binary_search_file(file_path, target) that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left")."

We need to produce a Python function that performs binary search on a file that is sorted lexicographically. The file is text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. We need to perform binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. The challenge is that the file is huge, so we cannot load the entire file into memory. We need to use file seek operations to jump to positions in the file. But the file is sorted lexicographically, but the file is not necessarily line aligned? Actually, it's a text file with lines. But we need to perform binary search on the file directly. We need to use file.seek() to jump to positions in the file. But the file is sorted lexicographically, but the file is not necessarily line aligned? Actually, it's a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order.
