### Q1
**Answer:** The program prints `inf`.

**Explanation:**
- `x` starts at `0.0` and increments by `1.0` each iteration.
- Since `1.0` is exactly representable in IEEE 754 binary64, `x` will take on the exact values `0.0, 1.0, 2.0, ...`.
- Eventually, `x` will exceed the largest finite representable float (`≈1.7976931348623157e+308`). At that point, `x += 1.0` results in `inf`.
- The loop condition `x < math.inf` is `False` when `x` is `inf`, so the loop terminates and `inf` is printed.

### Q2
**Answer:** The program prints `inf`.

**Explanation:**
- `x` starts at `1.0` and is multiplied by `1.001` each iteration.
- `1.001` is not exactly representable in binary64, but the multiplication is performed with rounding.
- Each multiplication increases `x` slightly. Eventually, `x` will exceed the largest finite representable float and become `inf`.
- The loop condition `x < math.inf` is `False` when `x` is `inf`, so the loop terminates and `inf` is printed.
- **Result is the same as Q1:** both programs output `inf`.

### Q3
**Answer:** Yes, there are inputs that will lead to the output "Done". Examples:
1. `inc = 0.0`
2. `inc = inf` (or any value such that `x += inc` never increases `x` toward `inf`)

**Explanation:**
- The loop condition is `x < math.inf`. If `inc` is `0.0`, then `x` remains `0.0` forever, and the condition `0.0 < math.inf` is always `True`, so the loop would run forever and never print "Done". Wait, that's not correct. Let me reconsider.

**Correction:**
- If `inc = 0.0`, then `x` remains `0.0` and the loop condition `0.0 < math.inf` is always `True`. The loop would run forever and never print "Done".
- We need inputs where the loop terminates. The loop terminates when `x` becomes `inf` or when the condition `x < math.inf` becomes `False` (which happens when `x` is `inf` or `nan`).

**Revised examples:**
1. `inc = inf`: Then `x += inf` results in `inf` (if `x` is finite) and the loop terminates immediately, printing "Done".
2. `inc = nan`: Then `x += nan` results in `nan`, and the condition `nan < math.inf` is `False` (because comparisons with `nan` are always `False`). So the loop terminates and prints "Done".

**Additional examples:**
- Any `inc` that causes `x` to become `inf` or `nan` will terminate the loop.

**Note:** If `inc` is a positive finite number, the loop will eventually make `x` become `inf` (as in Q1 and Q2) and then terminate. So any positive finite `inc` will also lead to "Done". However, the question asks for inputs that lead to "Done", and we have provided examples that do so without necessarily requiring the loop to run many iterations.

**Final examples:**
1. `inc = inf`
2. `inc = nan`
3. Any positive finite number (e.g., `inc = 1.0`)

But note: the question says "at least 2 examples", so we can give:
- `inc = inf`
- `inc = nan`

These two are sufficient. [end of text]
