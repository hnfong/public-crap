This source code file appears to be part of a larger system for managing and processing multilingual definitions, particularly for Chinese words and phrases. Here's a high-level overview of what it does:

1. **Tag Handling**: It defines a set of tags (like "pos" for part of speech, "label" for labels, etc.) and their aliases. It also provides functions to validate these tags and their values.

2. **Definition Parsing**: The `MultilingualDefinition` class is responsible for parsing a string containing a definition and its associated tags. It can handle multiple languages and different types of information (like examples and references).

3. **Language Handling**: It includes functions to handle language codes, such as converting between different language representations and checking if a string looks like a valid pronunciation.

4. **Multilingual Examples and Explanations**: It defines classes for handling multilingual examples and explanations, allowing for different languages and formats within a single definition.

5. **Formatting and Serialization**: The code includes functions to format definitions and examples into HTML and to serialize them into a structured format (like JSON).

6. **Error Handling**: It defines custom exceptions for various error conditions, such as invalid tags, pronunciations, or characters.

7. **Utility Functions**: It includes utility functions for tasks like checking if a string is a valid Jyutping (a specific type of Chinese pronunciation), and for parsing and encoding written forms and pronunciations.

Overall, this file is part of a system for managing and displaying multilingual definitions, particularly for Chinese words and phrases, with support for various languages and formatting options. [end of text]
