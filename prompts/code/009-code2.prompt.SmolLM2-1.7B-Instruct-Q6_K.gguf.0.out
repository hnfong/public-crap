Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a text file with names sorted in lexicographical order, we can use a modified binary search algorithm that takes advantage of the fact that the file contains names in sorted order. Here's a Python function that implements this:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    """
    Performs a binary search on a text file with names sorted in lexicographical order.

    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the text file.
        target (str): The target name to search for.

    Returns:
        int: The position of the target name in the file, or the insertion point if not found.
    """
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        names = f.readlines()

    # Convert each name to lowercase and sort them
    names = [name.strip().lower() for name in names]
    names.sort()

    # Perform binary search
    low, high = 0, len(names) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if names[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif names[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    # If the target is not found, return the insertion point
    return low
```

This function opens the file, reads all the names into a list, converts them to lowercase, sorts them, and then performs a binary search. If the target name is found, its position is returned. If not, the insertion point is returned, which is the position where the target name should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

Note that this function assumes that the file contains only names, and that the names are separated by newlines. It also assumes that the file is not too large, as it reads the entire file into memory.

Here's an example usage of the function:

```python
file_path = 'names.txt'
target = 'John'
position = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
print(position)
```

This will print the position of the target name in the file, or the insertion point if not found. [end of text]
