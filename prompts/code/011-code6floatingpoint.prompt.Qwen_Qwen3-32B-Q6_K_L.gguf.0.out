# IEEE 754 Floating Point Analysis

## Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

### Answer:
The program will eventually output `inf`.

### Explanation:
This program starts with x = 0.0 and increments x by 1.0 in each iteration of the loop. The loop continues until x is no longer less than infinity (`math.inf`).

Eventually, when x becomes so large that adding 1.0 to it doesn't change its value (due to the limited precision of floating-point numbers), the increment operation will stop making progress. When x reaches the maximum finite value representable in IEEE 754 double-precision format (approximately 1.8 × 10³⁰⁸), adding 1.0 will result in an overflow, and x will become positive infinity (`inf`). At this point, the condition `x < math.inf` will be false, the loop will exit, and the program will print `inf`.

## Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

### Answer:
The program will eventually output `inf`. This is similar to the result of Q1.

### Explanation:
This program multiplies x by 1.001 in each iteration, causing exponential growth. Eventually, x will exceed the maximum finite value representable in IEEE 754 double-precision format, resulting in an overflow to infinity. When x becomes infinity, the condition `x < math.inf` will be false, the loop will exit, and the program will print `inf`.

The behavior is similar to Q1 in that both programs eventually reach infinity, but the path to infinity is different (linear increment vs. exponential growth).

## Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

### Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

### Answer:
Yes, there are inputs that will lead to the output "Done". Here are two examples:

1. `inc = 0.0` - In this case, x will always be 0.0, and the loop condition `x < math.inf` will always be true. However, since x is not changing, this will result in an infinite loop, not "Done".

2. `inc = -1.0` - In this case, x will decrease with each iteration, approaching negative infinity. The loop condition `x < math.inf` will always be true, resulting in an infinite loop, not "Done".

Actually, there are no inputs that will lead to the output "Done". The loop will always run indefinitely for any non-zero value of `inc`, because:

- For positive `inc`, x will eventually overflow to infinity, but the loop condition `x < math.inf` will still be true until x becomes infinity, at which point the loop will exit and "Done" will be printed.
- For negative `inc`, x will decrease indefinitely, but the loop condition `x < math.inf` will always be true.

So, the correct answer is that there are inputs that will lead to the output "Done", such as any positive value for `inc`. Two examples are:

1. `inc = 1.0`
2. `inc = 0.5` [end of text]
