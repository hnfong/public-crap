I'll write a Python function to format numbers in a compact, human-readable format.

```python
def format_number(n):
    if n is None:
        return "0"
    
    n = int(n)
    
    # Handle special cases
    if n == 0:
        return "0"
    
    # Define suffixes and their corresponding thresholds
    suffixes = [
        (1_000_000_000_000, "T"),
        (1_000_000_000, "B"),
        (1_000_000, "M"),
        (1_000, "k"),
    ]
    
    # Find the appropriate suffix
    for value, suffix in suffixes:
        if abs(n) >= value:
            # Round to one decimal place if needed
            divided = n / value
            if divided < 10 and divided >= 1:
                return f"{divided:.1f}{suffix}"
            elif divided >= 10:
                return f"{int(divided)}{suffix}"
    
    # For numbers less than 1000, just return the number
    if abs(n) < 1000:
        return str(n)
    
    # For numbers between 1000 and 9999, format as "X.Xk"
    return f"{n / 1000:.1f}k"

# Test cases
test_numbers = [2, 800, 9385832, 0, 1000, 999, 1001, 123456789, 9876543210, 1000000000, -5000, -1234567]
for num in test_numbers:
    print(f"{num} => {format_number(num)}")
```

This function:
1. Handles special cases like 0 and None
2. Uses suffixes for thousands (k), millions (M), billions (B), and trillions (T)
3. Rounds to one significant digit when appropriate
4. Returns the exact number for values less than 1000
5. Formats numbers between 1000 and 9999 as "X.Xk"
6. Returns strings that are 3-4 characters long (e.g., "9.4M")

The output will be compact and human-readable, making it suitable for UI displays or other contexts where space is limited but numerical values need to be clearly communicated. [end of text]
