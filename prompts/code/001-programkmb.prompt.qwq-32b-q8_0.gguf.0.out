<think>
Okay, I need to write a Java program that reads a string from standard input, extracts numbers with possible suffixes like k, m, g, and converts them to their base values. Then sum all those values and display the total in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes. Let's think about how to approach this.

First, the input is a string from stdin. So I'll read that using BufferedReader. Then, I need to parse the string to find all the numbers with their suffixes. The numbers can have commas as thousand separators, so I need to remove those commas first before converting to a number.

Hmm, regular expressions might be the way to go here. The pattern should match numbers that may have commas and an optional suffix. Let's see: something like \d+(?:,\d+)*(?:\.\d+)?[kKmMgG]?

Wait, maybe the regex should capture the number part and the suffix part. So groups would help here. The regex could be something like ([\d,]+(?:\.\d+)?)([kKmMgG])? to capture the number and the suffix. But also, there might be numbers without a suffix, like 500,000K is part of the example, but also 500,000K is with a suffix. Wait, the example input includes "500,000K" which is a number with a comma and a suffix. So the regex needs to capture numbers with commas, decimals, and an optional suffix.

Alternatively, perhaps split the string into tokens, but that might be tricky. Using a regex to find all matches would be better. Let me think of the regex again. The number can have commas, like 1,000, so replace commas first before parsing. Wait, but the suffix comes after, so maybe first extract the entire token, then process each token.

So the plan is:

1. Read the entire input string.
2. Split into tokens using a regex that matches the number parts with possible suffixes.
3. For each token, process it:
   a. Remove commas from the numeric part.
   b. Check if there's a suffix (k, m, g, case-insensitive).
   c. Convert the numeric part to a double.
   d. Multiply by the appropriate factor (1 for no suffix, 1024 for K, 1024^2 for M, 1024^3 for G).
   e. Add to the total sum.
4. After processing all tokens, compute the total in bytes, then convert to K, M, G by dividing by 1024 each step.
5. Output the results with appropriate formatting.

Wait, but the example output shows that 1.5G is converted to 1.5 * 1024^3, right? Let me check the example input and output. The first example input has 1.5G and 4.2G, so total G part is 5.7G. The output's G line is 6.0 G, which suggests that the total is 5.7G, but when converted to bytes, then divided by 1024^3, it's 5.7, but in the output it's 6.0. Wait, maybe I need to check the example again.

Wait the example output shows:

7264621772.8 (total in bytes)
7094357.0 K (divided by 1024)
6928.0 M (divided by 1024^2)
6.0 G (divided by 1024^3)

Let me see: 7264621772.8 divided by 1024^3 (which is 1073741824) equals approximately 6.76, but the output shows 6.0. Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Wait the example input includes "1.5G, 2K, 3M, and 4.2G" and "500,000K and 600M".

Let me compute the total:

First part:

1.5G = 1.5 * 1024^3 = 1.5 * 1073741824 = 1610612736

2K = 2 * 1024 = 2048

3M = 3 * 1024^2 = 3 * 1048576 = 3145728

4.2G = 4.2 * 1073741824 = 4.2 * 1073741824 = let's see, 4 * 1073741824 is 4294967296, plus 0.2*1073741824 = 214748364.8 → total 4509715660.8

Adding those: 1610612736 + 2048 = 1610614784; plus 3145728 → 1613760512; plus 4509715660.8 → total so far 6123476172.8?

Wait, maybe I need to recalculate all parts:

Wait first part:

1.5G → 1.5 * 1024^3 = 1.5 * 1073741824 = 1610612736

2K → 2 * 1024 = 2048 → total so far 1610614784

3M → 3 * 1024^2 → 3 * 1048576 = 3,145,728 → total now 1610614784 + 3,145,728 = 1613,760,512

4.2G → 4.2 * 1073741824 = 4.2 * 1,073,741,824 → let's compute 4 * 1,073,741,824 = 4,294,967,296; 0.2 * 1,073,741,824 = 214,748,364.8 → total 4,509,715,660.8 → adding to previous total (1,613,760,512 + 4,509,715,660.8) → 6,123,476,172.8?

Then the second part:

500,000K → 500,000 * 1024 = 512,000,000

600M → 600 * 1024^2 → 600 * 1,048,576 = 629,145,600 → adding those to the total:

Total so far after first part: 6,123,476,172.8

Adding 512,000,000 → 6,635,476,172.8

Adding 629,145,600 → total 7,264,621,772.8 → which matches the example's first line. So that's correct.

Then the second line is 7,264,621,772.8 divided by 1024 → 7,094,357.0 (since 7,264,621,772.8 / 1024 = 7094357.0 exactly?)

Wait 7,264,621,772.8 divided by 1024: 7,264,621,772.8 / 1024 = 7094357.0 (since 7094357 * 1024 = 7,264,621, 772.8? Let me see 7094357 * 1024: 7094357 * 1000 = 7,094,357,000; 7094357 * 24 = 169, 064, 568 → total 7,263,421,568? Hmm maybe I should trust the example's output.

Anyway, the program needs to process each token correctly.

So steps for the code:

Read the input line(s) as a single string.

Use a regex to find all tokens that match the pattern of numbers with optional suffixes.

The regex pattern could be something like:

([\\d,]+(?:\\.\\d+)?)([kKmMgG])?

This would capture the number part (including commas and decimal) and the suffix (if present).

Wait, but the number can have a decimal part, like 1.5G. So the first group is the numeric part, which can have commas and a decimal point. The second group is the suffix.

Once we have each token, process each part:

For the numeric part:

- Remove commas: replace all commas with empty strings.

- Convert to a double. So "1,000.5" becomes "1000.5" → 1000.5.

Then, check the suffix:

- If no suffix, then the value is the number * 1 (so just the number).

- If the suffix is 'k' or 'K', multiply by 1024.

- 'm' or 'M' → 1024^2 (1048576).

- 'g' or 'G' → 1024^3 (1073741824).

So for each token, compute the value and add to the total.

Once all tokens are processed, the total is the sum in bytes.

Then, to display the sum in K, M, G:

sumK = total / 1024

sumM = total / (1024*1024)

sumG = total / (1024*1024*1024)

But since the output requires two decimal places, we need to format them properly.

Wait the example output shows:

7264621772.8 → which is exactly the total.

7094357.0 K → which is 7264621772.8 / 1024 = 7094357.0 exactly.

6928.0 M → 7264621772.8 / (1024^2) → 7264621772.8 / 1048576 = 6928.0 exactly?

Wait 1024^2 is 1,048,576. 7,264,621,772.8 divided by that is 7,264,621,772.8 / 1,048,576 = let's see:

1,048,576 * 6928 = 1,048,576 * 6000 = 6,291,456,000; 1,048,576 * 928 = ?

Well, 1,048,576 * 900 = 943,718,400; 1,048,576 * 28 = 29,360,128 → total 943,718,400 + 29,360,128 = 973,078,528 → total 6,291,456,000 + 973,078,528 = 7,264,534,528. Adding the remaining 88,244.8 (since 7,264,621,772.8 - 7,264,534,528 = 87,244.8?), maybe I'm miscalculating. Anyway, the example shows 6928.0, so it's exact.

Similarly, the G value is 7264621772.8 / (1024^3) → 7264621772.8 / 1073741824 = 6.768? Wait the example shows 6.0 G. Wait that can't be right. Wait the example output's last line is 6.0 G. Wait that must be a mistake? Or perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait let me recalculate the total:

The total is 7,264,621,772.8 bytes.

Divided by 1024^3 (1,073,741,824) gives:

7,264,621,772.8 / 1,073,741,824 = let's see:

1,073,741,824 * 6 = 6,442,450,944

Subtract that from total: 7,264,621,772.8 - 6,442,450,944 = 822,170,828.8

Divide by 1,073,741,824: 822,170,828.8 / 1,073,741,824 ≈ 0.766. So total is 6.766... which would round to 6.77, but the example shows 6.0. Wait that's conflicting. Wait the example output shows 6.0 G. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the example's input?

Wait the example input includes "500,000K and 600M".

Wait 500,000K is 500,000 * 1024 = 512,000,000 bytes.

600M is 600 * 1024^2 → 600 * 1,048,576 = 629,145,600.

Adding all parts:

First part:

1.5G → 1.5 * 1024^3 = 1,610,612,736

2K → 2048 → total so far 1,610,614,784

3M → 3,145,728 → total 1,613,760,512

4.2G → 4.2 * 1,073,741,824 = 4,509,715,660.8 → total after first part: 1,613,760,512 + 4,509,715,660.8 = 6,123,476,172.8

Second part:

500,000K → 512,000,000 → total now 6,635,476,172.8

600M → 629,145,600 → total 7,264,621,772.8 → correct.

Then total / 1024^3 is 7,264,621,772.8 / 1,073,741,824 = let's compute:

1,073,741,824 × 6 = 6,442,450,944

Subtract from total: 7,264,621,772.8 - 6,442,450,944 = 822,170,828.8

Divide by 1,073,741,824: 822,170,828.8 / 1,073,741,824 ≈ 0.766. So total is 6.766... which would be 6.77 when rounded to two decimal places. But the example shows 6.0. Wait that's a problem. Wait the example output's last line is 6.0 G. That suggests that perhaps the example is wrong, or I misunderstood the problem.

Wait looking back at the example output:

The example output given is:

7264621772.8

7094357.0 K

6928.0 M

6.0 G

Hmm, so the G value is exactly 6.0. That implies that the total is exactly 6 * 1024^3 = 6,442,450,944. But according to the input, the total is 7,264,621,772.8, which is higher. So there must be a mistake here. Wait maybe I made a mistake in the input parsing?

Wait let me recheck the example input:

The input is:

"1.5G, 2K, 3M, and 4.2G\n500,000K and 600M"

Wait the second line has "500,000K" which is 500,000 * 1024 = 512,000,000.

But 500,000K is 500 thousand K, so 500,000 * 1024 = 512,000,000.

Wait but 500,000K is 500 thousand K, so 500,000 * 1024 = 512,000,000.

But 500,000K is 500,000 * 1024 → yes.

Wait adding all parts:

First part:

1.5G → 1.5 * 1024^3 = 1,610,612,736

2K → 2048 → total 1,610,614,784

3M → 3,145,728 → total 1,613,760,512

4.2G → 4.2 * 1024^3 → 4.2 * 1,073,741,824 = 4,509,715,660.8 → total after first part: 1,613,760,512 + 4,509,715,660.8 = 6,123,476,172.8

Second part:

500,000K → 512,000,000 → total now 6,635,476,172.8

600M → 600 * 1024^2 → 600 * 1,048,576 = 629,145,600 → total becomes 6,635,476,172.8 + 629,145,600 = 7,264,621,772.8 → correct.

So the total is indeed 7,264,621,772.8 bytes.

Divided by 1024^3 (1,073,741,824) gives 7,264,621,772.8 / 1,073,741,824 = let's compute:

Let me compute 1,073,741,824 × 6.768 → 1,073,741,824 × 6 = 6,442,450,944; 1,073,741,824 × 0.768 = ?

0.768 × 1,073,741,824 = 1,073,741,824 × 0.7 = 751,619,276.8; 0.068 × 1,073,741,824 = 72,  let's see 1,073,741,824 × 0.06 = 64,424,509.44; 0.008 × 1,073,741,824 = 8,589,934.592 → total 64,424,509.44 + 8,589,934.592 = 73,014,444.032 → so total 0.768 is 751,619,276.8 + 73,014,444.032 = 824,633,720.832 → adding to 6,442,450,944 gives 7,267,084,664.832 → which is more than the total. Hmm, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Alternatively, perhaps the example output is rounded to one decimal place? Wait the example shows 6.0 G, which is exactly 6.0. So maybe the problem requires truncating or rounding to one decimal place? Or perhaps the example has a typo. Alternatively, maybe I misunderstood the suffix multipliers.

Wait the problem says:

"kilo=1024, M=1024*1024, etc."

So K is 1024, M is 1024^2, G is 1024^3. So the calculation is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the example output is wrong, but I have to follow the problem's example. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait let me compute 7,264,621,772.8 divided by 1024^3:

1024^3 = 1024 * 1024 * 1024 = 1,048,576 * 1024 = 1,073,741,824.

7,264,621,772.8 / 1,073,741,824 = let's do this division:

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 7,264,621,772.8 / 1,073,741,824 ≈ 7264.6217728 / 1073.741824 ≈ let's see:

1073.741824 × 6.768 = ?

Wait 1073.741824 × 6 = 6442.450944

1073.741824 × 0.768 = ?

0.7 * 1073.741824 = 751.6192768

0.068 * 1073.741824 = 72, 0.06 * 1073.741824 = 64.42450944; 0.008 * 1073.741824 = 8.589934592 → total 64.42450944 + 8.589934592 = 73.014444032 → total 751.6192768 + 73.014444032 = 824.633720832 → total 6442.450944 + 824.633720832 = 7267.084664832 → which is higher than 7264.6217728. So the actual value is less than 6.768.

Wait 1073.741824 × 6.76 = ?

Let me compute 6.76 × 1073.741824:

6 × 1073.741824 = 6442.450944

0.76 × 1073.741824 = ?

0.7 × 1073.741824 = 751.6192768

0.06 × 1073.741824 = 64.42450944 → total 751.6192768 + 64.42450944 = 816.04378624 → total 6442.450944 + 816.04378624 = 7258.49473024 → which is close to 7264.6217728.

The difference is 7264.6217728 - 7258.49473024 = 6.12704256 → so 6.76 + (6.12704256 / 1073.741824) → approximately 6.76 + 0.0057 → ~6.7657.

So the total in G is approximately 6.7657, which would be 6.77 when rounded to two decimal places. But the example shows 6.0. That's a discrepancy. Maybe the example is wrong, but I have to follow the problem's example. Alternatively, perhaps I misunderstood the problem's requirements.

Wait looking back at the problem statement's example output:

The last line is "6.0 G". So perhaps the problem requires truncating to one decimal place? Or maybe the example has a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the suffix multipliers are different. Wait the problem says "kilo=1024, M=1024*1024, etc." So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the example's input is different? Let me recheck the example input:

The example input is:

"1.5G, 2K, 3M, and 4.2G\n500,000K and 600M"

Wait the second line has "500,000K" which is 500 thousand K, so 500,000 * 1024 = 512,000,000.

But maybe the input is "500,000K" which is 500,000 K → 500,000 * 1024 = 512,000,000.

Wait adding all parts:

Total is 7,264,621,772.8 bytes.

Divided by 1024^3 gives 6.7657 → but the example shows 6.0. So perhaps the example is wrong, but I have to proceed as per the problem's example.

Alternatively, maybe the problem requires that the G value is the total divided by 1024^3, but rounded to the nearest integer? But the example shows one decimal place. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the regex pattern. Let me think again about the code.

The code steps:

Read the entire input as a string.

Use a regex to find all tokens. The regex should match numbers with optional suffixes.

The regex pattern could be something like:

\\b(\\d+(?:,\\d+)*(?:\\.\\d+)?)([kKmMgG])?\\b

But maybe better to use a pattern that captures the number part and the suffix.

Alternatively, perhaps the regex is:

([\\d,]+(?:\\.\\d+)?)([kKmMgG])?

But this might match parts of the string that are not intended. For example, in "1.5G", it would capture "1.5" and "G".

But commas are part of the number, so the first group is the numeric part with commas and decimals.

Once the tokens are extracted, process each one.

Now, in code:

We can use Pattern and Matcher.

The regex pattern could be:

String regex = "(\\d+(?:,\\d+)*(?:\\.\\d+)?)([kKmMgG])?";

But need to account for possible leading or trailing spaces, but the regex should capture the number and suffix.

Wait, perhaps the regex should be:

\\b(\\d+(?:,\\d+)*(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\s*([kKmMgG])?\\b

But maybe it's better to split on non-numeric and non-suffix characters, but that's complicated.

Alternatively, the regex can be:

([\\d,]+(?:\\.\\d+)?)([kKmMgG])?

But this might capture parts like "1.5G" as group1 "1.5" and group2 "G".

But also, numbers without suffixes would have group2 as null.

So in code:

Pattern p = Pattern.compile("([\\d,]+(?:\\.\\d+)?)([kKmMgG])?");

Then, for each match:

String numberPart = matcher.group(1);

String suffix = matcher.group(2);

Then process numberPart by removing commas and converting to double.

Then, based on suffix, multiply by the appropriate factor.

Now, code steps:

Read the input:

BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

String input = reader.readLine();

Wait, but the input may have multiple lines. The example input has two lines. So perhaps read all lines until EOF.

So:

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

String line;

while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {

    sb.append(line).append(" ");

}

String input = sb.toString().trim();

Then process the input string.

Then, the regex:

Pattern p = Pattern.compile("([\\d,]+(?:\\.\\d+)?)([kKmMgG])?");

Matcher m = p.matcher(input);

double total = 0;

while (m.find()) {

    String numStr = m.group(1);

    String suf = m.group(2);

    // process numStr: remove commas

    String cleanNum = numStr.replace(",", "");

    double num = Double.parseDouble(cleanNum);

    // determine the multiplier

    double multiplier = 1;

    if (suf != null) {

        char c = Character.toLowerCase(suf.charAt(0));

        switch(c) {

            case 'k': multiplier = 1024; break;

            case 'm': multiplier = 1024*1024; break;

            case 'g': multiplier = 1024*1024*1024; break;

        }

    }

    total += num * multiplier;

}

Then, after processing all tokens, compute the sums:

double sumK = total / 1024;

double sumM = total / (1024*1024);

double sumG = total / (1024*1024*1024);

Then, output the results with two decimal places.

But the example output shows one decimal place for the first line (7264621772.8), but two for the others. Wait the example output:

7264621772.8 → one decimal

7094357.0 K → one decimal (but written as .0)

6928.0 M → same

6.0 G → one decimal.

Hmm, so perhaps all outputs should be formatted to one decimal place.

Wait the example shows:

The first line is 7264621772.8 → one decimal.

The second line is 7094357.0 → one decimal.

Third: 6928.0 → one decimal.

Fourth: 6.0 → one decimal.

So the format should be with one decimal place.

So in code, use:

System.out.printf("%.1f%n", total);

System.out.printf("%.1f K%n", sumK);

System.out.printf("%.1f M%n", sumM);

System.out.printf("%.1f G%n", sumG);

Wait but in the example, the first line is exactly 7264621772.8, which is one decimal. The others have .0, which is also one decimal.

So that's the format.

Now, testing the code with the example input:

The code should process each token correctly.

Now, possible edge cases:

- Numbers without suffixes (e.g., "500" → 500 bytes).

- Numbers with commas but no suffix: "1,000" → 1000 bytes.

- Suffixes in uppercase: "2K" and "2k" both treated the same.

- Decimal numbers with suffixes: "1.5G".

- Numbers with both commas and decimals: "1,000.5K
