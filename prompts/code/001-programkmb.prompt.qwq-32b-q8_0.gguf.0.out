<think>
Okay, I need to write a Java program that reads input from standard input, processes all numbers with possible suffixes, converts them to their base values, sums them up, and then outputs the total in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes. Let me think through the steps.

First, the input can have multiple lines, so I'll read all lines until end of input. Maybe using a Scanner to read from System.in. The input might have commas as thousand separators, so I need to handle those. Also, the numbers can have suffixes like k, K, m, etc. So I need to parse each number along with its suffix.

The plan is to process each line, split into tokens, and for each token, check if it's a number with a possible suffix. The regular expression might help here. Maybe something like \d+(?:,\d+)?(?:\.\d+)?[kKmMgG]?

Wait, the numbers can have commas as thousand separators, like 500,000K. So the number part can be like 1,234.5 or 1234567. So the regex should match numbers with commas and optional decimal parts, followed by an optional suffix.

Hmm, perhaps the regex pattern should be something like:

([\\d,]+(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\s*([kKmMgG])?

Wait, but the suffix is optional. Wait, no, the suffix is optional? Wait the problem says "numbers followed by optional suffixes". So the suffix is optional. Wait, but in the example input, there's 500,000K which has a suffix, but also 500,000 without a suffix? Wait the example input includes "500,000K and 600M". So the numbers without suffixes would be treated as bytes. So the suffix is optional. So the regex should capture the number part and the suffix part (if present).

So the regex should match a number (with commas and decimal) followed by an optional suffix (case-insensitive). So the regex could be:

\\b(\\d+(?:,\\d+)*(?:\\.\\d+)?)([kKmMgG])?\\b

Wait, but maybe the suffix is at the end of the token. So perhaps the regex can be:

\\b(\\d+(?:,\\d+)*(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\s*([kKmMgG])?\\b

Hmm, but maybe it's better to split the string into tokens and process each token. Alternatively, use a regex to find all occurrences of the pattern.

Alternatively, using a regex to find all matches of the pattern. Let me think of the regex pattern again.

The number part can have commas as thousand separators, so like 1,234.5 or 123456. The suffix is optional, but if present, it's one of k/K/m/M/g/G.

So the regex pattern could be:

\\b(\\d+(?:,\\d+)*(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\s*([kKmMgG])?\\b

Wait, but the suffix is optional. So the group for the suffix is optional. So the regex would capture the number part (group 1) and the suffix (group 2 if present).

So, using a Pattern and Matcher to find all such occurrences in the input.

Once I have each number and its suffix, I need to parse the number, remove commas, convert to a double, then multiply by the appropriate factor based on the suffix.

The factors are:

- no suffix: 1 (so bytes)
- k/K: 1024
- m/M: 1024^2 (1048576)
- g/G: 1024^3 (1073741824)

So for each match:

1. Parse the number string, replacing commas with nothing, then convert to double.

2. Determine the suffix (case-insensitive). If no suffix, use 1.

3. Multiply the number by the factor to get the value in bytes.

Sum all these values.

Once the total is calculated, then we need to present the sum in bytes, kilobytes (divided by 1024), megabytes (divided by 1024^2), gigabytes (divided by 1024^3), each to one decimal place.

Wait, but the output requires the total in bytes, then the same total converted to each unit. So the total is the sum in bytes, then when converted to kilobytes, it's total / 1024, etc.

So the steps are:

- Read all input into a single string (or process line by line, but perhaps read all lines first).

- Use regex to find all number-suffix pairs.

- For each pair, compute the value in bytes and add to the total.

Once the total is known, compute the values in each unit:

sumK = total / 1024

sumM = total / (1024*1024)

sumG = total / (1024*1024*1024)

Then, format each of these to one decimal place.

Now, handling the regex:

The regex should capture all instances of numbers with optional suffixes. The problem says "numbers followed by optional suffixes", so the suffix must come right after the number, possibly with whitespace? Like in the example input, "2K," has the suffix followed by a comma. So the regex should account for possible trailing non-alphanumeric characters, but the suffix is only the letter.

Wait, the example input has "1.5G, 2K," so the suffix is followed by a comma. So the regex should capture the suffix even if there's a comma after it. So the regex should look for the suffix immediately after the number, ignoring any following characters except the suffix.

Hmm, perhaps the regex should be designed to capture the number and suffix even if there are other characters after. So the regex should match the number and suffix as a group, regardless of what comes after.

Alternatively, the regex can be written to match the number part and the suffix part, even if there are other characters after. So the regex can be:

\\b(\\d+(?:,\\d+)*(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\s*([kKmMgG])?

But the suffix is optional. Wait, no, the suffix is optional. Wait, the problem says "optional suffixes", so the suffix may or may not be present. So the regex should capture the suffix if it exists.

Wait, the regex should capture the number and the suffix (if present). So the regex can be:

\\b(\\d+(?:,\\d+)*(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\s*([kKmMgG])?\\b

Wait, but the suffix is optional. So the second group is optional. So the regex would have group 1 as the number, group 2 as the suffix (if present).

So, in code, for each match:

- group 1 is the number string (like "1.5", "2", "3M" no, wait no, the suffix is in group 2. Wait, no, the number part is group 1, and the suffix is group 2 if present.

Wait, let me think again. The regex is:

(\\d+(?:,\\d+)*(?:\\.\\d+)?) -> group 1 is the numeric part (with commas and decimal)

([kKmMgG])? -> group 2 is the suffix (if present)

So, for "1.5G", group1 is "1.5", group2 is "G".

For "500,000K", group1 is "500,000", group2 is "K".

For "500,000" (without suffix), group1 is "500,000", group2 is null.

So that's correct.

Now, processing each match:

First, parse the number string. Replace commas with empty, then parse as a double.

Then, check if group2 is present. If yes, get the suffix character (case-insensitive), then compute the multiplier.

So code steps:

Initialize total as a double.

Read all input into a string.

Use Pattern and Matcher:

Pattern p = Pattern.compile("\\b(\\d+(?:,\\d+)*(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\s*([kKmMgG])?\\b");

Wait, but the \\b is for word boundaries. Maybe that's okay, but perhaps the regex can be adjusted to capture numbers even if they are part of a larger string. Alternatively, perhaps the regex can be adjusted to not use word boundaries, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the regex can be written as:

"(\\d+(?:,\\d+)*(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\s*([kKmMgG])?"

But then it might match parts of other numbers. Hmm, perhaps better to use the word boundaries to ensure that the number is a whole token.

Alternatively, perhaps the regex can be adjusted to match any occurrence of the number followed by an optional suffix, regardless of surrounding characters. But that might be tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the regex can be written as:

"(\\d+(?:,\\d+)*(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\s*([kKmMgG])?"

But then, in cases like "123k456", it would match "123" with suffix "k", but the "456" would be part of another match. Hmm, but the problem states that the numbers are followed by optional suffixes, so perhaps the input is such that the numbers are properly separated. But the regex should capture all valid number-suffix pairs.

Alternatively, perhaps the regex can be written as:

"(\\d+(?:,\\d+)*(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\s*([kKmMgG])?"

But then, in the example input like "1.5G, 2K,", the "1.5G" would be matched as group1 "1.5", group2 "G", then "2K" as group1 "2", group2 "K".

The commas after are okay because the regex doesn't require anything after.

Hmm, perhaps the word boundaries are not necessary. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the regex can be written as:

"(\\d+(?:,\\d+)*(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\s*([kKmMgG])?"

But then, in cases like "abc123k", it would match "123" with suffix "k". But the problem says the input can contain multiple lines, but the numbers are to be extracted wherever they are. So perhaps the regex is okay.

Alternatively, perhaps the regex should be written as:

"(\\d+(?:,\\d+)*(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\s*([kKmMgG])?"

But then, the suffix is optional. Wait, no, the suffix is optional. Wait, the second group is [kKmMgG], but the ? makes it optional. Wait no, the group is ([kKmMgG])? so the entire suffix is optional. So the regex can match numbers with or without suffixes.

Wait, but the suffix is optional, so the regex can match numbers without suffixes. So that's correct.

So the regex is okay.

Now, in code:

Read all input into a single string. Because the input can have multiple lines, so using a Scanner and reading line by line, appending to a buffer.

Wait, but in Java, to read all input, perhaps:

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

String input = scanner.useDelimiter("\\A").next();

That's a common way to read all input at once.

Then, create the pattern and matcher.

Then, loop over all matches.

For each match:

- group1 is the number string (like "1.5", "500,000")

- group2 is the suffix (like "G", "K", or null)

Process the number:

String numberStr = matcher.group(1);

numberStr = numberStr.replace(",", "");

double number = Double.parseDouble(numberStr);

Then, check if there is a suffix:

String suffix = matcher.group(2);

if (suffix != null) {

    char c = suffix.charAt(0);

    switch (Character.toLowerCase(c)) {

        case 'k':

            number *= 1024;

            break;

        case 'm':

            number *= 1024 * 1024;

            break;

        case 'g':

            number *= 1024 * 1024 * 1024;

            break;

        default:

            // shouldn't happen, since regex ensures it's k/m/g

    }

} else {

    // no suffix, so it's already in bytes, so no change

}

Wait, no. Wait, the suffix determines the unit. For example, "2K" is 2 * 1024 bytes. So the number is in the unit of the suffix. So the code above is correct: the number is multiplied by the factor to get bytes.

Wait, the suffix is the unit. So for example, "1.5G" is 1.5 * 1024^3 bytes. So yes, the code is correct.

So adding this number to the total.

Once all matches are processed, the total is the sum in bytes.

Then, compute the values for K, M, G:

double sumK = total / 1024;

double sumM = total / (1024 * 1024);

double sumG = total / (1024 * 1024 * 1024);

Then, format each to one decimal place.

The output should be:

First line: total (to one decimal)

Second line: sumK with "k"

Third: sumM with "M"

Fourth: sumG with "G"

Each formatted to one decimal place, with trailing .0 if needed, but one decimal.

So, using DecimalFormat:

DecimalFormat df = new DecimalFormat("#.0");

But need to make sure that it doesn't add unnecessary trailing zeros. Wait, the example output shows "7094357.2 k" which has one decimal. So the format should be to one decimal place, with one digit after the decimal.

Alternatively, using String.format with "%.1f".

Yes, perhaps using String.format is better.

So:

System.out.println(String.format("%.1f", total));

System.out.println(String.format("%.1f k", sumK));

System.out.println(String.format("%.1f M", sumM));

System.out.println(String.format("%.1f G", sumG));

Wait, but the first line is just the total in bytes, which is a double. So for example, in the sample input, the total is 7264621772.8, which is exactly one decimal.

Wait, but when you do total / 1024, that could be a number with more decimals, but we need to round to one decimal place.

Wait, the problem says "to one decimal place". So we need to format each to one decimal, rounding as necessary.

So using String.format with "%.1f" is correct.

Now, putting all together.

Now, code structure:

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Read all input into a string

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        String input = scanner.useDelimiter("\\A").next();

        scanner.close();

        // Compile the regex pattern

        Pattern p = Pattern.compile("(\\d+(?:,\\d+)*(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\s*([kKmMgG])?");

        Matcher m = p.matcher(input);

        double total = 0.0;

        while (m.find()) {

            String numberStr = m.group(1);

            numberStr = numberStr.replace(",", "");

            double number = Double.parseDouble(numberStr);

            String suffix = m.group(2);

            if (suffix != null) {

                char c = suffix.charAt(0);

                switch (Character.toLowerCase(c)) {

                    case 'k':

                        number *= 1024;

                        break;

                    case 'm':

                        number *= 1024 * 1024;

                        break;

                    case 'g':

                        number *= 1024 * 1024 * 1024;

                        break;

                }

            }

            total += number;

        }

        // Compute the other values

        double sumK = total / 1024;

        double sumM = sumK / 1024;

        double sumG = sumM / 1024;

        // Alternatively:

        // double sumK = total / 1024;

        // double sumM = total / (1024*1024);

        // double sumG = total / (1024*1024*1024);

        // Either way is okay, but the first way is more efficient.

        // Now format and print.

        System.out.printf("%.1f%n", total);

        System.out.printf("%.1f k%n", sumK);

        System.out.printf("%.1f M%n", sumM);

        System.out.printf("%.1f G%n", sumG);

    }

}

Wait, but in the code above, when the suffix is present, the number is multiplied by the factor to get bytes. So the total is in bytes. Then, sumK is total / 1024, which is correct.

Wait, but in the code above, when the suffix is 'k', the number is multiplied by 1024 (so becomes bytes). So the total is in bytes. So yes.

Testing with the example input:

Sample input:

1.5G, 2K,

3M, and 4.2G

500,000K and 600M

Let's compute each term:

1.5G → 1.5 * 1024^3 = 1.5 * 1073741824 = 1610612736

2K → 2 * 1024 = 2048

3M → 3 * 1024^2 = 3 * 1048576 = 3145728

4.2G → 4.2 * 1073741824 = 4.2 * 1073741824 = let's see: 4 * 1073741824 = 4294967296, plus 0.2 * 1073741824 = 214748364.8 → total 4509715660.8

500,000K → 500000 * 1024 = 512000000

600M → 600 * 1048576 = 629145600

Adding all these:

1610612736 + 2048 = 1610614784

+3145728 → 1613760512

+4509715660.8 → total so far 1613760512 + 4509715660.8 = 6123476172.8

+512000000 → 6635476172.8

+629145600 → 7264621772.8 → which matches the sample output's first line.

So the code should work.

Wait, but in the code, when the suffix is 'k', the number is multiplied by 1024 (so becomes bytes). So the code is correct.

Now, the regex: does it capture all the numbers?

In the example input:

"1.5G" → group1 is "1.5", group2 "G".

"2K" → group1 "2", group2 "K".

"3M" → group1 "3", group2 "M".

"4.2G" → group1 "4.2", group2 "G".

"500,000K" → group1 "500,000", group2 "K".

"600M" → group1 "600", group2 "M".

Yes, all are captured.

Another test case: "500,000" (no suffix) → group2 is null, so it's 500000 bytes.

So the code should handle that.

Now, what about numbers with commas and decimals, like "1,234.56k"?

The regex would capture "1,234.56" as group1, and "k" as group2. Replacing commas gives "1234.56", multiplied by 1024 → correct.

Edge cases: numbers like "1234" (no suffix) → added as 1234 bytes.

What about a number like "12k3"? The regex would capture "12" with suffix "k", then the "3" would be part of another match? Not sure, but the problem states that the input is such that numbers are followed by optional suffixes, so perhaps such cases are not part of the input. The regex is designed to capture the number and suffix as per the problem's spec.

Another possible issue: numbers like "123,45" (with comma but no decimal). The regex allows that via the (?:,\\d+)* part. So "123,45" becomes 12345 when commas are removed.

Now, the code uses the regex without word boundaries. Let me see if that's okay.

Suppose the input has "abc123kxyz". The regex would match "123" with suffix "k".

But the problem says to extract all numbers followed by optional suffixes, so that's correct.

Another case: "12kK" → the suffix is "k", but the next "K" is part of the suffix? No, because the regex captures the first suffix. Wait, the regex is (\\d+...)([kKmMgG])? So the suffix is the first letter after the number. So in "12kK", the suffix is "k", and the "K" is part of the rest of the string. So the code would process "12" with "k" suffix, and the "K" is not part of a number.

So that's okay.

Now, the code uses the regex as written. Let me check the regex again.

The regex is:

"(\\d+(?:,\\d+)*(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\s*([kKmMgG])?"

Wait, the group2 is optional because of the ? after the ([kKmMgG]). Wait no, the group is ([kKmMgG])? → the entire group is optional. So the suffix can be present or not.

Wait, the regex is:

(\\d+(?:,\\d+)*(?:\\.\\d+)?) → group1 (the number part)

\\s* → any whitespace between number and suffix

([kKmMgG])? → group2 (the suffix, optional)

So the entire suffix part (including the possible whitespace) is optional.

Wait, but the suffix can be directly after the number, like "123k".

The regex allows that because the \\s* can be zero spaces.

So the regex is okay.

Now, in code, when group2 is null, it means no suffix, so the number is in bytes.

Now, the code uses the switch on the suffix's lowercase character.

Yes.

Now, the code uses the total variable as a double. Since the numbers can be large (like gigabytes), but Java's double can handle that up to certain limits. Since 1 gigabyte is about 1e9, so 1e12 is manageable as a double. The sample output's total is ~7e9, which is okay.

Now, the formatting with String.format.

The first line is total, which is in bytes, formatted to one decimal.

The second line is sumK = total / 1024 → which is kilobytes, formatted to one decimal.

Third line is sumM = sumK / 1024 → which is megabytes.

Fourth line is sumG = sumM / 1024 → gigabytes.

Alternatively, the code could compute sumM as total/(1024*1024), but the way it's written is okay.

Testing with the sample input:

Total is 7264621772.8

sumK = 7264621772.8 / 1024 = 7094357.2 (exactly, since 1024 * 7094357.2 = 7264621772.8)

sumM = 7094357.2 / 1024 = 6928.1 (since 1024 * 6928.1 = 7094358.4, but perhaps due to rounding)

Wait, let me compute:

7094357.2 divided by 1024:

7094357.2 / 1024 = 7094357.2 / 1024 ≈ 6928.1 (exactly?)

Let me compute 1024 * 6928.1 = 6928.1 * 1024 = 6928 * 1024 + 0.1 * 1024 = 7093248 + 102.4 = 7093350.4. Hmm, but the actual value is 7094357.2 / 1024 = 7094357.2 / 1024 = let's see:

7094357.2 divided by 1024:

1024 × 6928 = 1024 × 6900 = 7,037, 280 (wait, 1024 × 6928 = 6928 × 1000 + 6928 × 24 = 6,928,000 + 166,272 = 7,094,272. Then 7,094,272 + 0.2 × 1024 = 7,094,272 + 204.8 = 7,094,476.8. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Anyway, the sample output shows 6928.1 M, so the code's calculation must be correct.

The code uses the division and the formatting to one decimal, so it should be okay.

Now, the code uses the regex correctly, and the rest of the logic is correct.

Now, the code must be in a single file, so the class must be public class Main.

Yes, the code above is correct.

Wait, but in the code, the regex is written as:

Pattern p = Pattern.compile("(\\d+(?:,\\d+)*(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\s*([kKmMgG])?");

Wait, the regex is missing the backslashes for the Java string. Oh right! Because in Java, the string must have the backslashes escaped.

Ah, right! I made a mistake here. The regex in Java must have the backslashes doubled.

So the correct regex string is:

"(\\d+(?:,\\d+)*(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\s*([kKmMgG])?"

Wait, let me re-express the regex properly in Java:

The regex in Java should be written as:

"(\\d+(?:,\\d+)*(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\s*([kKmMgG])?"

Wait, let's see:

The original regex is:

\d+(?:,\d+)*(?:\.\d+)?\s*([kKmMgG])?

But in Java, each backslash must be doubled. So the Java string should be:

"(\\d+(?:,\\d+)*(?:\\.\\d+)?)\\s*([kKmMgG])?"

Yes.

So in the code, the pattern is correctly written with the doubled backslashes.

Yes, so the code is correct.

Another possible issue: the regex may match numbers that are part of other words. For example, "abc123kdef" would match "123" with suffix "k". But according to the problem statement, the input is such that numbers are followed by optional suffixes, so this is acceptable.

Thus, the code should work.
