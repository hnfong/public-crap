 Performing a binary search directly on a text file requires some additional steps compared to a binary search on a sorted list in memory. The basic idea is to use the `seek()` method to move the file pointer to the middle of the file, read a block of data, and then determine if the target value is in that block. Depending on the result, you then move the file pointer to the middle of the appropriate half of the file and repeat the process.

Here's a Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        size = os.path.getsize(file_path)
        left, right = 0, size - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            f.seek(mid)
            prev_byte = f.read(1)
            is_eol = prev_byte in (b'\n', b'\r')
            if is_eol and mid > 0:
                f.seek(mid - 1)
                prev_byte = f.read(1)
            current_byte = f.read(1)
            if is_eol and not current_byte:
                # End of file reached, target not found
                return None
            if not is_eol and not current_byte:
                # End of line reached, move to the next line
                f.seek(mid + 1)
                continue
            if prev_byte < current_byte:
                # We're at the beginning of a line
                line_start = mid
            block = f.read(4096).decode('utf-8', 'ignore').strip().split('\n')
            for i, line in enumerate(block):
                if line == target:
                    # Target found, return the byte position
                    return mid + len(line.encode('utf-8')) + i
                if line > target:
                    # Target is in the first half
                    right = mid - 1
                    break
                # Target is in the second half
                left = mid + 1 + i
                if mid + 1 + i >= size:
                    # Target not found, return the insertion point
                    return left
```

This function uses the `os.path.getsize()` method to get the size of the file in bytes, and then performs a binary search by seeking to the middle of the file and reading a block of data. It uses the `decode()` method to convert the block from bytes to a string, and then splits the string into lines. It then checks each line to see if it matches the target, and adjusts the `left` and `right` indices accordingly.

Note that this function assumes that the lines in the file are separated by newline characters (`\n` or `\r\n`), and that the file is encoded in UTF-8. If your file uses a different line separator or encoding, you'll need to modify the function accordingly.

Also note that this function returns `None` if the target is not found in the file. If you want to return the insertion point instead, you can modify the function to return `left` when the end of the file is reached. [end of text]
