Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Q1. The eventual output of the following Python program is `inf` (infinity).

```python
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

Explanation: In IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic, the `inf` (infinity) value is the result of adding a finite number to itself repeatedly until it exceeds the maximum finite value that can be represented. In this program, `x` starts at `0.0` and is incremented by `1.0` in each iteration of the loop. Since `1.0` is a finite number, adding it to itself repeatedly will eventually exceed the maximum finite value, resulting in `inf`. The loop condition `x < math.inf` will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate, printing `inf`.

Q2. The eventual output of the following Python program is also `inf` (infinity), but it is different from the results above in terms of how it reaches infinity.

```python
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

Explanation: In this program, `x` starts at `1.0` and is multiplied by `1.001` in each iteration of the loop. Since `1.001` is greater than `1.0`, multiplying it by itself repeatedly will cause `x` to grow without bound, eventually exceeding the maximum finite value that can be represented, resulting in `inf`. The loop condition `x < math.inf` will no longer be true, and the loop will terminate, printing `inf`.

Q3. The program will lead to the output "Done" if the input `inc` is `0.0`. This is because adding `0.0` to `x` in each iteration of the loop will not change the value of `x`. Therefore, the loop condition `x < math.inf` will always be true, and the loop will continue indefinitely. However, since the loop does not contain any operations that would cause the program to terminate prematurely, the program will run indefinitely and never print "Done". Another input that would lead to the output "Done" is any negative number, as adding a negative number to `x` will eventually make `x` less than `0.0`, causing the loop condition `x < math.inf` to become false and the loop to terminate.
