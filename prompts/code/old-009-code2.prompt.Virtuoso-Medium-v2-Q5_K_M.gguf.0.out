To perform a binary search on a file directly, we can use the `seek()` method to move the file pointer to a specific position in the file. We can then read a line from the file and compare it to the target. If the line is less than the target, we move the file pointer to the middle of the remaining lines and repeat the process. If the line is greater than the target, we move the file pointer to the middle of the previous lines and repeat the process. We continue this process until we find the target or reach the end of the file.

Here's a Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        # Get the size of the file
        f.seek(0, 2)
        size = f.tell()
        f.seek(0)

        # Initialize the search range
        low = 0
        high = size - 1

        # Perform binary search
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            f.seek(mid)

            # Skip to the next line if we're in the middle of a line
            if mid != 0 and f.read(1) != '\n':
                f.readline()

            # Read the line and compare to the target
            line = f.readline().strip()
            if line == target:
                return f.tell() - len(line) - 1
            elif line < target:
                low = f.tell()
            else:
                high = mid - 1

        # Return the insertion point if the target is not found
        return low
```

This function takes a file path and a target string as input, and returns the position of the target in the file, or the insertion point if the target is not found. The function uses the `seek()` method to move the file pointer to the middle of the search range, and then reads a line from the file using the `readline()` method. If the line is less than the target, the function updates the search range to the upper half of the file. If the line is greater than the target, the function updates the search range to the lower half of the file. The function continues this process until it finds the target or reaches the end of the file.

The time complexity of this function is O(log(n)), where n is the number of lines in the file. This is because the function performs a binary search on the file, which has a time complexity of O(log(n)). The space complexity of the function is O(1), since it only uses a constant amount of extra space to store the search range and the file pointer. [end of text]
