<think>Okay, I need to write a Python function called make_string that takes an integer and converts it into a compact string like "0.8k" or "9.4M". Let's think about how to approach this.

First, the examples given: 800 becomes 0.8k. Wait, 800 is 800,000 when converted to thousands. So 800 divided by 1000 is 0.8. Then 9385832 divided by 1,000,000 (which is million) is 9.385832, which rounds to 9.4M. So the pattern is to divide the number by a certain power of ten (like 10^3 for k, 10^6 for M, etc.), then round it to two significant digits, and append the suffix.

So the steps are:

1. Determine the appropriate suffix (like k, M, B for billion?), but the examples use k and M. Wait, the examples are k (thousand) and M (million). So the standard abbreviations. So the suffixes would be for thousand (10^3), million (10^6), billion (10^9), etc. But need to check what the user expects. The problem says "any popular and reasonable programming language", but the examples use k and M. So the standard SI-like prefixes but for the thousand. Like:

- 10^3 → k
- 10^6 → M
- 10^9 → B (billion)
- 10^12 → T (trillion), etc.

But maybe the problem expects up to certain levels. Let's proceed with the common ones.

So the plan is to find the highest power of 1000 (or 10^3) that the number can be divided by to get a number that can be represented with two significant digits. Wait, but perhaps the approach is to group the number into thousands, millions, billions, etc., and then represent it with two significant digits plus the suffix.

But how to decide which suffix to use. For example, for numbers >= 1,000,000, we use M. For numbers between 1000 and 1,000,000, use k. For numbers less than 1000, just the number itself.

Wait, but 800 is 0.8k. Wait, 800 is 800, which is 800. So when divided by 1000, it's 0.8. So the suffix is k (thousand). So the approach is to find the largest possible suffix (like M, then k) such that when the number is divided by the corresponding 10^3 exponent, it's at least 1. Because if the number is 1500, then 1.5k. But if the number is 1000, it's 1k. But if the number is 999, then it's 999, not 0.999k. Wait, but in the example, 800 becomes 0.8k. So 800 is 800, which is 0.8 * 1000. So the code must check for numbers >= 1000, and then find the appropriate suffix.

Wait, perhaps the way to approach this is to find the highest power of 1000 such that when the number is divided by that power, the result is >= 1. Then, we can represent it with two significant digits and the suffix.

Wait, for example:

Take 800. The possible exponents are 3 (10^3). 800 / 1000 = 0.8. But 0.8 is less than 1. So maybe the code is looking for the highest exponent where the number divided by that exponent is >= 1. So for 800, the highest exponent is 1000 (10^3), but 800/1000 is 0.8 <1. So perhaps the code uses exponents in the order of 10^3, 10^6, etc., and finds the first exponent where the number divided by it is >= 1. Then, use that exponent. Wait, but 800 is 0.8k. So perhaps the code uses exponents starting from the largest possible (like 10^3, 10^6, etc.), and for each, checks if the number is >= that exponent. Then, the suffix is determined by the exponent.

Wait, perhaps the code should find the largest exponent (like 1e3, 1e6, 1e9, etc.) such that the number is >= exponent. Then, divide the number by that exponent, round to two significant digits, and append the suffix.

Wait, let's test this logic with the examples.

Example 1: 2. The number is 2. The exponents would start from 1e3 (1000). 2 < 1000, so move to lower exponents. The next is 1 (1e0). 2 >=1. So divide by 1, which is 2. So output is "2".

Example 2: 800. The exponents are 1e3 (1000). 800 <1000. Next exponent is 1e0 (1). 800 >=1. Wait, but that would give 800/1 = 800, which would be "800", but the example expects "0.8k". So this approach is incorrect.

Hmm. So perhaps the code should find the largest exponent such that when the number is divided by the exponent, the result is >=1. So for 800, the exponents would be 1e3 (1000). 800/1000 = 0.8 <1. So next exponent is 1e3 * 1e3 = 1e6? No. Wait, perhaps the exponents are 1e3, 1e6, 1e9, etc. So for 800, the largest exponent where the number divided by it is >=1 is 1e3? No, 800/1e3 is 0.8. So that's less than 1. So perhaps the code uses exponents in the order of 1e3, 1e6, etc., but for each exponent, check if the number is >= exponent. If not, then proceed to the next lower exponent. Wait, but 800 is less than 1e3 (1000). So the code would check 1e3: 800 <1e3. Then check 1e2 (100). 800 >=100. So divide by 1e2 (100) → 8. Then append the suffix for 1e2? But 1e2 is 100, which is 10^2. So the suffix would be 'hundred'? But that's not standard. So perhaps the code is looking for exponents that are multiples of 1e3. So exponents are 1e3, 1e6, 1e9, etc. So for 800, the code would check 1e3 (1000). 800 <1000. So next is 1e6 (1,000,000). 800 <1e6. So proceed to lower exponents? But perhaps the code is looking for the largest exponent that is <= the number. Wait, perhaps the code should find the highest exponent (like 1e3, 1e6, etc.) such that the number is >= exponent. Then, divide the number by that exponent and append the suffix.

Wait, let's take 800. The exponents are 1e3 (1000). 800 <1000. So the next lower exponent is 1e2 (100). 800 >=100. So divide by 100 → 8. Then append the suffix for 1e2. But what suffix is that? 1e2 is 100, which is 10^2. But the standard suffixes are for 1e3 (k), 1e6 (M), 1e9 (B), etc. So perhaps
