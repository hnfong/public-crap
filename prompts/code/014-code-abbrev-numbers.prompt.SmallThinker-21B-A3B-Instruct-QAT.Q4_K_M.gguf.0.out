To solve this problem, we need to convert an integer into a compact, human-readable string format that represents the number with a few significant digits and its order of magnitude. The output should be as concise as possible, ideally under 4 characters.

### Approach
1. **Special Case Handling**: If the input number is 0, directly return "0".
2. **Determine Order of Magnitude**: Calculate the order of magnitude (k) by finding the largest power of 10 that is less than or equal to the absolute value of the input number.
3. **Adjust Number**: Divide the input number by 10 raised to the power of k to get a value between 1 and 10.
4. **Format the Output**: Round the adjusted number to one decimal place and format it to ensure it has exactly one decimal digit. Combine this with the appropriate order of magnitude suffix (k, M, B, T, etc.) to form the final string.

### Solution Code
```python
import math

def compact_number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return "0"
    abs_n = abs(n)
    k = int(math.log10(abs_n))
    if k < 0:
        k = 0
    adjusted = abs_n / (10 ** k)
    rounded = round(adjusted, 1)
    if rounded == int(rounded):
        rounded_str = f"{int(rounded)}"
    else:
        rounded_str = f"{rounded:.1f}"
    suffix = ""
    if k >= 12:
        suffix = "T"
    elif k >= 9:
        suffix = "B"
    elif k >= 6:
        suffix = "M"
    elif k >= 3:
        suffix = "k"
    else:
        suffix = ""
    return f"{rounded_str}{suffix}"
```

### Explanation
1. **Special Case Handling**: The function immediately returns "0" if the input is 0.
2. **Order of Magnitude Calculation**: Using logarithms, we determine the largest power of 10 that fits within the absolute value of the input number. This helps in identifying the appropriate order of magnitude.
3. **Adjustment and Rounding**: The input number is divided by 10 raised to the calculated order of magnitude to bring it into the range [1, 10). This adjusted number is then rounded to one decimal place to ensure it is concise.
4. **Suffix Determination**: Based on the order of magnitude, the appropriate suffix (k, M, B, T) is appended to the rounded number. This ensures the output is compact and readable.

This approach efficiently converts large numbers into a compact form, making them easier to read and understand while adhering to the constraint of keeping the output under 4 characters when possible. [end of text]
