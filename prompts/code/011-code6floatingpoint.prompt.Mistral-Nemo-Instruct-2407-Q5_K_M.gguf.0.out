Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Remember to answer all the questions

Q1.
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The eventual output of the first Python program is `inf`. This is because in IEEE 754 floating point representation, there is a value `inf` (infinity) that represents the result of division or arithmetic operation where the result is too large to represent. In this case, the loop continues until `x` becomes `inf`.

Q2.
<|im_end|>
