Here's a possible implementation of the realpath() function using Python:

```bash
function realpath() {
    python3 -c "from pathlib import Path; print(Path($1).resolve())"
}
```

This implementation uses the `pathlib` module in Python to resolve the absolute path of the input file or directory. The `Path` object is created with the input argument, and the `resolve()` method is called on it to get the absolute path.

Here's how you can use the `realpath()` function in your script:

```bash
set -x
my_real_path=$(realpath "$0")
echo "The real path of this script is $my_real_path"
```

This script will print the real path of the script that is currently being executed.

Note that the `set -x` command is used to enable debugging output, so you can see the command being executed and its arguments.
