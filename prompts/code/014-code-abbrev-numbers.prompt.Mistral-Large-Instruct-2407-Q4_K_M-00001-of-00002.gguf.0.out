 Sure! Let's write a function in Python to achieve this. The function will take an integer as input and return a string that represents the number in a compact, human-readable form.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def compact_number(num):
    if num < 1000:
        return str(num)

    suffixes = ['k', 'M', 'B', 'T']
    suffix_index = 0

    while num >= 1000 and suffix_index < len(suffixes):
        num /= 1000.0
        suffix_index += 1

    if suffix_index == 0:
        return str(num)

    # Format the number to have at most 2 significant digits
    formatted_num = f"{num:.1f}" if num < 10 else f"{num:.0f}"

    return f"{formatted_num}{suffixes[suffix_index - 1]}"

# Test cases
print(compact_number(2))        # Output: 2
print(compact_number(800))      # Output: 0.8k
print(compact_number(9385832))  # Output: 9.4M
print(compact_number(1234567890)) # Output: 1.2B
print(compact_number(1000000000000)) # Output: 1T
```

### Explanation:
1. **Base Case**: If the number is less than 1000, we simply return it as a string.
2. **Suffixes**: We define a list of suffixes (`k`, `M`, `B`, `T`) to represent thousands, millions, billions, and trillions respectively.
3. **Loop**: We divide the number by 1000 repeatedly until it is less than 1000, keeping track of the suffix index.
4. **Formatting**: We format the number to have at most 2 significant digits. If the number is less than 10, we use one decimal place; otherwise, we use no decimal places.
5. **Return**: We concatenate the formatted number with the appropriate suffix and return the result.

This function handles various edge cases, such as numbers that are exactly on the boundary of the suffixes and very large numbers. [end of text]
