Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

---

Remember to answer all the questions

Q1.

assistant
Q2.

Yes, the program will output "Done" if the user enters a number less than infinity.

Q3.

Yes, the program will output "Done" if the user enters a number less than infinity.

Note: The program is designed to keep asking the user for input until they enter a number less than infinity. [end of text]
