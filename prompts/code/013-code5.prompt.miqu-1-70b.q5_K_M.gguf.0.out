What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The given program will not produce any output, as it will enter an infinite loop. The `math.inf` represents positive infinity in Python, and the `while` loop condition will always be `True` as long as `x` is less than infinity. Even though `x` is getting closer to infinity with each iteration, it will never actually reach infinity, causing the loop to continue indefinitely.

In summary, the program will not terminate, and it won't print any output.
