To perform a binary search on a file containing names in lexicographical order, we can treat the file as a sorted list of names. The function `binary_search_file` will read the file, sort the names, and then perform a binary search on the sorted list.

Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    """
    Perform a binary search on a file containing names in lexicographical order.
    Returns the index of the target, or the insertion point (as in bisect_left).
    
    Args:
        file_path (str): Path to the text file containing sorted names.
        target (str): The name to search for.
    
    Returns:
        int: The index of the target, or the insertion point (bisect_left style).
    """
    # Read the file and extract the names
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        names = [line.strip() for line in file]

    # Sort the names (though the file is already sorted, this is a safeguard)
    names.sort()

    # Binary search implementation
    low = 0
    high = len(names) - 1
    insertion_point = 0

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if names[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif names[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    # If not found, return the insertion point
    return insertion_point
```

### Example Usage:

```python
# Assume the file 'names.txt' contains:
# Alice
# Bob
# Charlie
# David

print(binary_search_file('names.txt', 'Bob'))  # Output: 1
print(binary_search_file('names.txt', 'Eve'))  # Output: 3
```

### Notes:
- The file must be sorted lexicographically.
- The function assumes that the file is read and sorted, which is a common approach for binary search on a file.
- The `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module can be used as a more efficient alternative, but this implementation is straightforward and clear.

Let me know if you'd like to integrate this with `bisect` or optimize further! [end of text]
