<Thought>
Alright, I need to write a complete single-file Java program that reads a string from standard input, processes it to extract numbers with optional suffixes (k, K, m, M, g, G), converts these numbers to their base values based on the suffixes provided, calculates the sum of these values, and then prints out the total sum along with the sum converted to kilobytes (K), megabytes (M), and gigabytes (G), all formatted to one decimal place.

First, I'll need to handle reading input from standard input. In Java, I can use `BufferedReader` wrapped around `System.in` to read the input line by line. Since the input can contain multiple lines, I'll read until there's no more input.

Next, I need to extract numbers followed by optional suffixes. The suffixes are k, K, m, M, g, G. I'll need to identify these patterns in the input string. Regular expressions might be useful here to match numbers followed by these suffixes. I'll have to ensure that the regex correctly captures the number and the suffix, even if there are commas as thousand separators.

Once I have the numbers with their respective suffixes, I need to convert them to their base values. The base values are:
- k and K: 1024
- m and M: 1024 * 1024
- g and G: 1024 * 1024 * 1024

I'll need to map these suffixes to their corresponding multipliers. I'll have to handle both lowercase and uppercase suffixes, so my mapping should account for both cases.

After converting each number to its base value, I'll sum all these values. I'll need to ensure that the sum is accurate, especially since some of the numbers might be quite large.

Finally, I need to print out the total sum along with the sum converted to K, M, and G, each formatted to one decimal place. I'll have to calculate these conversions by dividing the total sum by the base values for K, M, and G respectively.

I also need to handle potential edge cases, such as:
- Input lines that don't contain any valid numbers.
- Numbers without any suffix.
- Non-numeric values that might be present in the input.
- Ensuring that the program doesn't crash if unexpected input is provided.

To make the program production-ready, I'll need to ensure that it's robust, handles exceptions gracefully, and provides meaningful error messages if something goes wrong. I'll also need to make sure that the program is efficient, especially if dealing with very large inputs.

Additionally, I'll need to ensure that the program adheres to good coding practices, such as proper variable naming, commenting where necessary, and following Java conventions.

Alright, time to start coding. I'll begin by setting up the main method, reading the input, processing each line, extracting and converting the numbers, summing them up, and then printing the results.
