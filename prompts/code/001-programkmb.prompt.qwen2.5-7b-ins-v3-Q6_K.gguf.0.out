<Thought>
Alright, I need to write a complete single-file Java program that reads a string from standard input, processes it to extract numbers followed by optional suffixes like k, K, m, M, g, G, converts these numbers to their base values, sums them up, and then prints the total sum along with the sum converted to kilobytes (K), megabytes (M), and gigabytes (G). The program should handle numbers with commas as thousand separators and support both lowercase and uppercase suffixes. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll need to read input from the standard input. In Java, I can use `BufferedReader` wrapped around `System.in` to read the input string. I'll need to ensure that the input is properly read and parsed.

Next, I need to extract all numbers followed by optional suffixes. The suffixes are k, K, m, M, g, G. I'll have to use a regular expression to match these patterns. The regex should capture numbers that may have commas and optional suffixes.

Once I have the numbers with their respective suffixes, I need to convert them to their base values. The base values are:
- k and K: 1024
- m and M: 1024 * 1024
- g and G: 1024 * 1024 * 1024

I'll need to parse the numbers, remove the commas, and then apply the appropriate multiplier based on the suffix.

After converting all the numbers to their base values, I'll sum them up. I'll have to ensure that the sum is accurate, especially since we're dealing with large numbers and floating-point precision.

Finally, I need to print the total sum along with the sum converted to K, M, and G. I'll have to format the output to match the example output, ensuring that the numbers are displayed with the correct number of decimal places.

I also need to handle edge cases, such as:
- Input strings with no numbers or invalid formats.
- Numbers without any suffix.
- Multiple consecutive commas.
- Very large numbers that might cause overflow.

To make the program production-ready, I'll need to ensure that it's robust, handles exceptions gracefully, and provides meaningful error messages if something goes wrong.

Additionally, I'll consider using Java's standard library methods to keep the program within the specified constraints. I'll avoid using any external libraries or frameworks.

Let me start drafting the code structure:

1. Import necessary packages from `java.*`.
2. Create a `main` method.
3. Read input from `System.in` using `BufferedReader`.
4. Use regex to extract numbers with optional suffixes.
5. Parse and convert each number to its base value.
6. Sum all the converted numbers.
7. Format and print the total sum and the sum in K, M, and G.

I'll need to be careful with the regex pattern to ensure it correctly captures numbers with commas and optional suffixes. Also, I'll have to handle the conversion from strings to numbers, ensuring that commas are removed and the correct suffix multipliers are applied.

Testing the program with the provided examples will be crucial to ensure it behaves as expected. I'll need to run multiple test cases, including those with commas, different suffixes, and large numbers.

Alright, time to put this into code.
