Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").
To perform a binary search on a text file where each line contains a name sorted lexicographically, you can follow these steps:

1. **Open the file**: You need to open the file and read its contents.
2. **Binary Search Algorithm**: Implement the binary search algorithm to search for the target name.
3. **File Position Tracking**: Since you need to perform binary search directly on the file, you need to keep track of the current position in the file.

### Steps to Implement Binary Search on a File:

1. **Read the file in binary mode**: This allows you to seek to specific positions in the file.
2. **Determine the file size**: This helps in calculating the mid-point during binary search.
3. **Binary Search Logic**: Implement the binary search logic, but instead of reading the entire file into memory, read only the necessary parts of the file.

### Python Implementation:

Here's a Python function that performs binary search directly on the file:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        file.seek(0, 2)  # Seek to the end of the file to get the file size
        file_size = file.tell()
        low, high = 0, file_size

        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            file.seek(mid)
            file.readline()  # Move to the beginning of the next line
            line = file.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()

            if line == "":
                high = mid  # If we've reached the end of the file, adjust high
            else:
                if line < target:
                    low = mid + 1
                else:
                    high = mid

        # At this point, low is the insertion point
        return low

# Example usage:
file_path = 'sorted_names.txt'
target = 'Alice'
position = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
print(f"The target '{target}' should be inserted at position {position}.")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Opening the File**: The file is opened in binary mode (`'rb'`) to allow seeking to specific positions.
2. **File Size Calculation**: The file size is determined by seeking to the end of the file and using `tell()` to get the current position (which is the size of the file).
3. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - **Mid Calculation**: The mid-point is calculated as the average of `low` and `high`.
   - **Reading the Line**: The file pointer is moved to the mid-point, and the next line is read. This ensures that you are reading the line that starts at or after the mid-point.
   - **Comparison**: The line is compared with the target. Depending on the comparison, the search space is adjusted accordingly.
   - **Insertion Point**: Once the loop exits, `low` represents the insertion point where the target should be inserted.

### Notes:

- **Efficiency**: The algorithm operates in O(log(n)) time complexity, where n is the number of lines in the file.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles cases where the target is not found by returning the insertion point.
- **File Handling**: The file is read in binary mode to allow seeking and reading specific parts of the file efficiently.

This approach allows you to perform a binary search directly on a large file without loading the entire file into memory, making it suitable for very large datasets. [end of text]
