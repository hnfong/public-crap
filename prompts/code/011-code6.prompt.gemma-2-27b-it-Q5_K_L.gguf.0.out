Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

You're right to be curious about this!  Here's the breakdown:

**The Problem:**

The code is designed to continuously add the `inc` value to `x`. Since `math.inf` represents positive infinity, the `while` loop's condition (`x < math.inf`) will *always* be true. This means the loop will run forever, and the program will never reach the "Done" output.

**Inputs That Won't Work:**

* **Any positive number:** Adding a positive number to `x` will make `x` larger, ensuring the condition `x < math.inf` remains true.
* **Zero:** Adding zero won't change `x`, so the condition will still be true.

**The Catch:**

There's no input that will cause the loop to terminate naturally. The program is stuck in an infinite loop.

**To Fix It:**

You'd need to modify the loop's condition or introduce a way to break out of the loop under certain circumstances. For example:

```python
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number: "))
limit = float(input("Enter a limit: "))  # Ask for a limit

while x < limit:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Now, the loop will stop when `x` reaches the user-specified `limit`.
