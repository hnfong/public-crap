Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a text file with lines containing names sorted in lexicographical order, we can follow these steps:

1. Open the file and read the first line to get the initial range of the search.
2. Read the middle line of the file to get the current guess.
3. Compare the current guess with the target name.
4. If the current guess is equal to the target, return the current position.
5. If the current guess is greater than the target, update the upper bound of the search range to the current position minus one.
6. If the current guess is less than the target, update the lower bound of the search range to the current position plus one.
7. Repeat steps 2-6 until the target is found or the search range is exhausted.
8. If the target is not found, return the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

Here's the implementation of the `binary_search_file` function in Python:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Read the first line to get the initial range of the search
        first_line = file.readline().strip()
        lower_bound = 0
        upper_bound = sum(1 for line in file)

    # Reset the file pointer to the beginning of the file
    file.seek(0)

    while lower_bound <= upper_bound:
        # Calculate the middle position
        middle = (lower_bound + upper_bound) // 2

        # Read the middle line
        file.seek(middle * len(first_line))
        current_guess = file.readline().strip()

        # Compare the current guess with the target
        if current_guess == target:
            return middle
        elif current_guess > target:
            upper_bound = middle - 1
        else:
            lower_bound = middle + 1

    # If the target is not found, return the insertion point
    return lower_bound
```

This implementation assumes that the file is not too large to fit into memory. If the file is too large, we can modify the implementation to read and compare lines in chunks instead of reading the entire file at once.
