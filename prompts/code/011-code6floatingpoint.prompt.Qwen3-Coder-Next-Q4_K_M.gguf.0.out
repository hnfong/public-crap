Let's analyze each question under IEEE 754 floating-point semantics.

---

**Q1.**  
```python
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

- `math.inf` is positive infinity (`+∞`).
- Starting from `x = 0.0`, we repeatedly add `1.0`.
- In IEEE 754 double-precision (Python's default `float`), adding finite numbers to finite numbers yields finite numbers *until overflow occurs*.
- However, in practice, `x += 1.0` will keep increasing `x` — but **double-precision floats have a maximum finite value**, `max_float ≈ 1.7976931348623157e308`.
- Once `x` exceeds `max_float`, the next addition `x + 1.0` will overflow to `+∞` (since `1.0` is negligible compared to the magnitude, and rounding rules push it to infinity).
- Specifically, when `x` reaches `max_float`, adding `1.0` may or may not overflow depending on rounding mode, but eventually, after enough steps, `x` will become `inf`.
- Once `x == math.inf`, the loop condition `x < math.inf` becomes `False`, and the loop exits.
- Then `print(x)` outputs `inf`.

✅ **Answer Q1:**  
The program prints `inf`.

**Q2.**  
```python
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

- Here, `x` starts at `1.0` and is multiplied by `1.001` each iteration — exponential growth.
- Again, `x` grows until it exceeds `max_float`, then overflows to `+∞`.
- Once `x == math.inf`, `x < math.inf` is `False`, loop exits.
- `print(x)` outputs `inf`.

✅ **Answer Q2:**  
The program also prints `inf`.  
**Is it different?** No — same output: `inf`.  
The *path* differs (linear vs. exponential growth), but the eventual overflow to `inf` and termination is identical.

**Q3.**  
```python
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

We want inputs (`inc`) such that the loop *terminates* and `"Done"` is printed.

The loop terminates only if `x` eventually becomes `≥ math.inf`, i.e., `x` overflows to `+∞`.  
But note: if `inc` is **non-positive**, the behavior changes drastically.

Let’s consider cases:

- **`inc > 0` (finite positive)**:  
  As in Q1/Q2, `x` increases monotonically and eventually overflows to `+∞`, so loop exits → `"Done"` prints.

- **`inc = 0.0`**:  
  Then `x += 0.0` → `x` stays `0.0` forever.  
  Loop condition `0.0 < math.inf` is always `True` → infinite loop → `"Done"` never prints.

- **`inc < 0` (negative)**:  
  Then `x` decreases: `x = 0.0, inc, 2·inc, 3·inc, ...` → goes toward `-∞`.  
  In IEEE 754, when a negative number underflows beyond the most negative finite value, it becomes `-inf`.  
  Once `x == -math.inf`, the condition `x < math.inf` is still `True` (since `-∞ < +∞`), so the loop continues forever — no `"Done"`.

Wait! But what about **`inc = math.inf`**?  
- `inc = float('inf')`  
- Then `x = 0.0 + inf = inf`  
- Loop condition: `inf < inf` → `False` → loop exits → `"Done"` prints.

Similarly, **`inc = -math.inf`**?  
- `x = 0.0 + (-inf) = -inf`  
- Condition: `-inf < inf` → `True` → loop continues: `-inf + (-inf) = -inf` → stuck in infinite loop.

So safe inputs that cause termination:

1. Any **finite positive** `inc > 0` (e.g., `inc = 1.0`, `inc = 0.0001`)  
   → eventually overflows to `+∞`, loop exits.

2. `inc = math.inf`  
   → `x = 0.0 + inf = inf`, loop exits immediately.

3. Also: `inc = float('nan')`?  
   - `x += nan` → `x = nan`  
   - Comparison `nan < inf` is `False` (all comparisons with `nan` are `False`)  
   → loop exits → `"Done"` prints!  
   ✅ Yes! NaN comparisons are always false.

So examples:

- `inc = 1.0` → finite positive → overflow → `"Done"`
- `inc = float('inf')` → `x` becomes `inf` → `"Done"`
- `inc = float('nan')` → `x` becomes `nan`, `nan < inf` is `False` → `"Done"`

✅ **Answer Q3:**  
Yes, there are inputs that cause `"Done"` to print.

**Two examples:**
1. `inc = 1.0` (finite positive) — eventually overflows to `inf`.
2. `inc = float('inf')` — `x` becomes `inf` immediately.

*(Bonus: `inc = float('nan')` also works, since `nan < inf` is `False`.)*

### Final Answers:

**Q1:** Prints `inf`  
**Q2:** Prints `inf` — same as Q1  
**Q3:** Yes. Examples: `inc = 1.0`, `inc = float('inf')` (or `inc = float('nan')`) [end of text]
