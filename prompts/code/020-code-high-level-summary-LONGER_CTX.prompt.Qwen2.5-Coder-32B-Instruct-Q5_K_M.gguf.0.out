This source code file is part of a software system that processes and manages definitions for words, particularly in a multilingual context, likely for a dictionary or a similar application. Here's a high-level overview of what it does:

1. **Tag Handling**: The file defines a set of tags that can be associated with word definitions, such as part of speech, labels, synonyms, antonyms, references, and images. It also includes logic to handle aliases for these tags.

2. **Validation**: It includes validation functions to ensure that the tags and their values are correct and conform to expected formats.

3. **Parsing**: The file contains logic to parse strings that contain word definitions and associated tags. It extracts the tags and their values and organizes them in a structured way.

4. **Serialization**: It provides methods to convert the structured data back into a serialized string format, which can be stored or transmitted.

5. **Multilingual Support**: The system supports multiple languages for explanations and examples, allowing for definitions to be provided in different languages.

6. **Error Handling**: It includes error handling for various issues that might arise during parsing and validation, such as invalid tags or values.

7. **Utility Functions**: The file includes utility functions for tasks such as determining the language of a text, checking if a string looks like Jyutping (a romanization system for Cantonese), and formatting text for HTML output.

8. **Data Models**: It references data models for words and their written forms, which are used to check the existence of words and to generate links to other words in the dictionary.

Overall, this file is responsible for managing the structure, validation, and serialization of word definitions in a multilingual dictionary application. [end of text]
