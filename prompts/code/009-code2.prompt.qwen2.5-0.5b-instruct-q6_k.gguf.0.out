To perform a binary search on a file directly using at most O(log(n)) operations, we can follow these steps:

1. Read the first line of the file.
2. Read the next line of the file.
3. Compare the target with the first line.
4. If the target is less than the first line, move to the next line.
5. If the target is greater than the first line, move to the next line.
6. If the target is equal to the first line, return its position.
7. If the target is not found, return the insertion point.

Here's the Python function `binary_search_file(file_path, target)`:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    # Read the first line of the file
    first_line = file_path.readline()
    
    # Read the next line of the file
    next_line = file_path.readline()
    
    # Compare the target with the first line
    if target < first_line:
        return first_line.find(target)
    elif target > first_line:
        return next_line.find(target)
    
    # If the target is equal to the first line, return its position
    if target == first_line:
        return first_line.find(target)
    
    # If the target is not found, return the insertion point
    return next_line.find(target)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Reading the first line**: We read the first line of the file using `file_path.readline()`.
2. **Reading the next line**: We read the next line of the file using `file_path.readline()`.
3. **Comparing the target with the first line**: We compare the target with the first line. If the target is less than the first line, we return the position of the first line. If the target is greater than the first line, we return the position of the next line.
4. **If the target is equal to the first line**: We return the position of the first line if the target is equal to the first line.
5. **If the target is not found**: We return the position of the next line if the target is not found.

This approach ensures that we perform at most O(log(n)) operations, as required by the problem statement. [end of text]
