To perform a binary search on a file directly using at most O(log(n)) operations, we can use a combination of Python's built-in functions and the `bisect` module. The `bisect` module provides a convenient way to perform binary search on sorted lists. Here's a Python function that performs a binary search on a file:

```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    # Open the file in read mode
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Read the first line of the file
        line = file.readline()
        # Convert the line to a list of characters
        chars = list(line)
        # Perform binary search on the list of characters
        index = bisect.bisect_left(chars, target)
        # Return the index of the target or the insertion point
        return index
```

This function works as follows:

1. It opens the file in read mode using `open(file_path, 'r')`.
2. It reads the first line of the file using `file.readline()`.
3. It converts the line to a list of characters using `list(line)`.
4. It uses `bisect.bisect_left(chars, target)` to perform the binary search on the list of characters.
5. It returns the index of the target or the insertion point.

This approach ensures that the binary search is performed in O(log(n)) time, where n is the number of characters in the file. The `bisect` module is used to perform the binary search, which is efficient for large files. [end of text]
