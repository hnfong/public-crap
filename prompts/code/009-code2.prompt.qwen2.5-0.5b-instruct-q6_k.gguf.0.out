Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a file directly, we can use a binary search tree (BST) to store the names in a sorted order. This allows us to perform binary search operations in logarithmic time. Here's how you can implement this:

1. **Create a Binary Search Tree**: Insert the names into the BST.
2. **Binary Search**: Perform binary search on the BST to find the target or the insertion point.

Here's the Python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)`:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    # Step 1: Create a Binary Search Tree
    bst = BST()
    
    # Step 2: Insert the names into the BST
    for line in file_path:
        bst.insert(line)
    
    # Step 3: Perform binary search on the BST
    return bst.search(target)
```

### Explanation:

1. **BST Creation**: We create a `BST` object to store the names in a sorted order. The `BST` class is a simple implementation of a binary search tree.

2. **File Reading**: We read the file line by line into the `bst`.

3. **Binary Search**: We use the `search` method of the `BST` object to find the target or the insertion point. The `search` method returns the index of the target if found, or `None` if not found.

### Example Usage:

```python
# Example file path
file_path = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry", "fig", "grape", "honeydew", "kiwi", "lemon", "mango", "nectarine", "orange", "peach", "plum", "quince", "raspberry", "strawberry", "tangerine", "watermelon"]

# Target name to search for
target = "peach"

# Perform binary search
result = binary_search_file(file_path, target)

# Print the result
print(f"Target '{target}' found at index: {result}")
```

This approach ensures that the binary search operation is performed in logarithmic time, making it efficient for large files. [end of text]
