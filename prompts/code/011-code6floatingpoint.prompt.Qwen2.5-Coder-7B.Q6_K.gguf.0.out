Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Q1.
The program will eventually output infinity (math.inf) because the value of x will keep increasing by 1.0 in each iteration of the while loop until it reaches infinity.

Q2.
The program will eventually output infinity (math.inf) as well, but it will take longer to reach infinity compared to the previous program. The value of x will keep increasing by a factor of 1.001 in each iteration of the while loop until it reaches infinity. This is because the increment is smaller than 1.0, so it takes more iterations to reach infinity.

Q3.
Yes, there are inputs that will lead to the output "Done". For example, if the user enters a negative number as the increment, the value of x will keep decreasing and eventually become negative. Since the condition x < math.inf is still true, the loop will continue until the user enters a positive number as the increment. Another example is if the user enters a very small positive number as the increment, the value of x will take a very long time to reach infinity, so the loop may never terminate and the program may run indefinitely.
