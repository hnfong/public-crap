Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Q1.

Q1. The eventual output of the following Python program is not defined, as it will run indefinitely without stopping. The loop will continue to execute as long as `x` is less than `math.inf`, and since `x` is incremented by `1.0` each iteration, it will never reach `math.inf` (which is the largest value representable in IEEE 754 floating point). Therefore, the program will not reach the `print(x)` statement unless it is interrupted by the user or the Python environment.

```python
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

Q2. The eventual output of the following Python program will also not be reached in a finite amount of time for the same reason as the first question: the loop will run indefinitely. However, the value of `x` will increase with each iteration, making it progressively closer to `math.inf`. The multiplication by `1.001` ensures that `x` is always slightly larger than its previous value, but it will still never reach `math.inf`. Thus, the `print(x)` statement will not be executed unless the program is interrupted.

```python
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

Q3. For the third program:

```python
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

The output "Done" will be printed if the value entered for `inc` is such that, when added to `x`, it never reaches or exceeds `math.inf` within the limits of floating-point precision. Given the nature of IEEE 754 floating point, any finite value for `inc` will eventually lead to `x` exceeding `math.inf` due to the cumulative effect of additions, because the precision of floating-point numbers is not infinite. However, there are cases where the loop will appear to run indefinitely due to the limitations of floating-point precision:

1. If `inc` is entered as `0.0`, the loop will not progress, and "Done" will be printed immediately.
2. If `inc` is entered as a very small positive number close to the machine epsilon (the smallest value such that `1.0 + eps > 1.0`), the loop could run for a very long time before `x` exceeds `math.inf` due to the cumulative effect of additions. In practice, this could be a number like `1e-20` or smaller, depending on the precision of the Python environment.

It's important to note that due to the finite precision of floating-point numbers, adding a very small increment to `x` will eventually lead to a situation where the value of `x`, when rounded to the nearest representable floating-point number, will exceed `math.inf`. However, for very small increments, this could take an impractically long time to occur, effectively making the program appear to run indefinitely within the constraints of a practical execution environment.
