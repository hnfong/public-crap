This source code file appears to be a part of a large project that deals with processing and analyzing Chinese language texts, specifically Cantonese. 

The file is responsible for parsing and processing Chinese text data, including parts of speech, labels, and pronunciations. It seems to be designed to work with a specific format of text data that includes explanations and examples in multiple languages.

The file provides functions and classes for:

1. Parsing and validating the input text data, including checking for correct syntax and formatting.
2. Extracting and processing parts of speech, labels, and pronunciations from the text data.
3. Creating objects to represent explanations and examples, including multilingual examples with multiple languages.
4. Formatting the text data into a human-readable format, including HTML and JSON representations.

The file also includes error handling and validation mechanisms to ensure that the input data is correct and consistent. It appears to be designed to work within a larger project that involves natural language processing and machine learning tasks. [end of text]
