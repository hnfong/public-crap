Okay, I need to figure out how to perform a binary search directly on a text file that's already sorted lexicographically. The goal is to do this in O(log n) operations. Hmm. Let's think.

So, binary search works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. But normally, you'd need to access the middle element, which in a file requires reading that line. But if the file is too big to load into memory, we can't just read all the lines at once. Wait, the problem says the lines are sorted, but how is the file structured? Each line is a name, and they're in order. So each line is a separate entry.

The challenge is to read the file without loading all lines into memory. So we need to find a way to determine which part of the file to read next, based on the current position. But how do we handle the middle element when we can't just jump to a random position in the file? Because files are sequential, you can't just skip ahead. Wait, but maybe the file is stored in a way that allows us to read a certain number of lines at a time. Or perhaps we can use the file's size to calculate the position.

Wait, maybe the file is stored as a regular text file, where each line is separated by a newline character. So the first step would be to get the total number of lines in the file. That way, we can know the upper and lower bounds for the binary search. But how do we get the total number of lines without reading the entire file? Well, we can read the file once to count the lines, but that would take O(n) time, which is not acceptable if the file is huge. Wait, but the problem says to use at most O(log n) operations. So maybe the initial step of counting the lines is allowed? Or perhaps the problem assumes that we can get the file size, but in reality, for a text file, the number of lines isn't the same as the file size because of varying line lengths and possible trailing newlines. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is simplified, and we can assume that each line is exactly one character, but that's not realistic. So perhaps the approach is to first read the entire file to get the number of lines, but that would take O(n) time. But the problem says to perform the binary search in O(log n) operations. So perhaps the initial step of getting the file size is considered acceptable, even if it's O(n), because the binary search itself is O(log n). Wait, but the problem says "using at most O(log n) operations". So maybe the initial step of counting the lines is part of the O(log n) process? That doesn't make sense. Because counting the lines would require reading the entire file, which is O(n). So perhaps the problem expects that we can somehow perform the binary search without knowing the file size in advance? Or maybe the file is stored in a way that allows us to calculate the position, like each line is stored in a fixed-length block, but that's not standard.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more about the algorithm, assuming that we can read a certain number of lines from the file starting at a given offset. For example, in Python, if we can read lines in chunks, or perhaps read a line at a given position. But in reality, in a regular text file, you can't just jump to a line number directly. Unless the file is structured with each line being exactly one character, but that's not the case here. So maybe the problem is expecting a theoretical approach where we can access the k-th line directly, which would be possible in some hypothetical file system. But in practice, that's not how files work. So perhaps the problem is assuming that we can read the middle line by seeking to the middle position in the file. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting that the binary search is implemented in such a way that each step requires reading a line from the file, and each read operation is O(1), but the total number of reads is O(log n). So the algorithm would proceed by checking the middle line, then adjust the search range based on the comparison, similar to standard binary search, but each time reading a line from the file. But how do we handle the fact that we can't just jump to the middle line in the file? Because in reality, you can't do that unless you know the exact position of each line.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the lines are stored in a way that allows us to calculate their positions. For example, each line is stored with a known length. But in reality, lines can have varying lengths. So maybe the problem is abstracting away the details of the file and focusing on the algorithm. So the key is to perform the binary search steps, each time reading a line from the current midpoint of the search range, and then adjusting the search range accordingly. The main point is that each step requires one read operation (assuming that reading a line is O(1)), and the number of steps is O(log n). So the algorithm would be similar to standard binary search, but instead of having an array, you read the line at the current mid position each time.

So the steps would be:

1. Determine the low and high boundaries (initially 0 and n-1, where n is the number of lines in the file). But to get n, we need to read the entire file first, which is O(n). But the problem says to use O(log n) operations. Hmm. So perhaps the problem allows us to first read the entire file to get the list of lines, but that would require O(n) time and space, which is not feasible for very large files. But the problem says "using at most O(log n) operations", which probably refers to the number of read operations. So maybe the initial step of reading the entire file is allowed, but that's O(n) time. But perhaps the problem is expecting that the binary search itself is O(log n) steps, each involving a read. So perhaps the code would first read the entire file into a list, then perform a standard binary search. But that would require O(n) space. But the problem says "perform a binary search on the file directly", implying that we shouldn't read the entire file into memory. So perhaps the correct approach is to read the file once to get the size, then perform the binary search steps by reading the necessary lines as needed. But how to get the size without reading the entire file?

Wait, in Python, the file object has a method called seek() and tell(). So perhaps we can first read the end of the file to get the size. For example, we can move the file pointer to the end, then backtrack to count lines. But that would require reading the entire file again. Alternatively, perhaps we can read the file once, keeping track of the number of lines as we go. But that would require reading the entire file, which is O(n) time. But the problem says to use O(log n) operations. So maybe the problem is expecting that the code first reads the entire file into memory, which is O(n), but then the binary search is O(log n). But the problem says "using at most O(log n) operations", which might refer to the number of read operations. So perhaps the code is allowed to read the entire file once (O(n)), but then the binary search is O(log n). But the problem says "perform a binary search on the file directly", which suggests that we don't read the entire file into memory. So perhaps the approach is to read the file in chunks, or to perform the binary search by reading lines as needed, without storing all lines in memory.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting that the code uses the standard binary search algorithm, but instead of having an array, it reads the lines from the file at each step. So the code would start with low=0 and high= some maximum (maybe the file size minus one). But how to get the high value without reading the entire file? So perhaps the code first reads the entire file to get the list of lines, then performs the binary search. But that would require O(n) space. But the problem says "using at most O(log n) operations", which might refer to the number of read operations. So perhaps the code is allowed to read the entire file once (which is O(n)), but then the binary search is O(log n) steps. But the problem says "using at most O(log n) operations", which might mean that the total number of read operations is O(log n). So perhaps the code can't read the entire file first. So how to proceed?

Wait, perhaps the code can read the file once, but during the binary search steps, only read the necessary lines. For example, the code can first read the entire file to get the list of lines, but that's O(n) time. But the problem says to perform the binary search in O(log n) operations. So maybe the code is allowed to read the entire file once, but the binary search steps are O(log n). But the problem says "using at most O(log n) operations", which probably refers to the number of read operations. So perhaps the code can read the entire file once (which is O(n)), but then the binary search is O(log n) steps. But that's conflicting. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the code
