To perform a **binary search on a text file directly**, we need to:

1. **Read the file in lexicographical order** (as given).
2. **Perform a binary search on the lines** of the file.
3. **Return the byte position** of the target line, or the **insertion point** (as in `bisect_left`).

### Key Points:
- The file is already sorted lexicographically.
- We need to **search for the target byte string** in the file.
- We will **not load the entire file into memory**, but instead **read lines one by one** during the binary search.
- We will **keep track of the byte position** of each line.

### Python Function Implementation

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    """
    Perform a binary search on a text file that is sorted lexicographically.
    Returns the byte position of the target, or the insertion point (as in bisect_left).
    """
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        lines = []
        byte_positions = []
        line_number = 0
        while True:
            line = f.readline()
            if not line:
                break
            lines.append(line)
            byte_positions.append(f.tell())
            line_number += 1

    # Binary search on the lines
    left = 0
    right = len(lines) - 1
    result = 0

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        line = lines[mid]
        # Compare the line with the target (byte string)
        # Use the 'compare' logic similar to bisect_left
        if line < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
            result = mid  # Update result to the current index

    # The result is the index of the insertion point
    # Return the byte position of the line at 'result'
    return byte_positions[result]
```

### Example Usage

Given the file:

```
1 I go to school
2 by bus
foo bar
hello world
zoo zoo zoo
```

The byte positions of the lines are:

- Line 0: `b'1 I go to school\n'` → byte position 0
- Line 1: `b'2 by bus\n'` → byte position 17
- Line 2: `b'foo bar\n'` → byte position 34
- Line 3: `b'hello world\n'` → byte position 51
- Line 4: `b'zoo zoo zoo\n'` → byte position 68

So, `binary_search_file("myfile.txt", b"2 by")` should return **17**, which is the byte position of the line containing `"2 by"`.

---

### Notes:
- This implementation **does not load the entire file into memory**, but reads it line by line.
- It uses the **byte comparison** to find the target.
- The function returns the **byte position** of the line where the target is found, or the **insertion point** if not found.

Let me know if you'd like to modify the function to return the line itself or handle edge cases like empty files. [end of text]
