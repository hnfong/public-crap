To perform a binary search on a text file directly, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the file in binary mode and seek to the middle of the file. This can be done using the `os` and `io` libraries in Python.
2. Read the middle line and compare it with the target. If the target is less than the middle line, seek to the left half of the file. If the target is greater than the middle line, seek to the right half of the file. Repeat this process until the target is found or the file is exhausted.
3. Keep track of the number of steps taken to find the target. This will give you the position of the target in the file.
4. If the target is not found in the file, return the insertion point, which is the position where the target should be inserted to maintain the lexicographical order. This can be done using the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` library in Python.

Here's a Python function that implements the above steps:

```python
import os
import io
from bisect import bisect_left

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        f.seek((os.fstat(f.fileno()).st_size >> 1) - 1)  # Seek to the middle of the file
        while True:
            line = f.readline().decode('utf-8').strip()  # Read the middle line
            steps = f.tell()  # Keep track of the number of steps taken
            if line == target:  # If the target is found, return its position
                return steps
            elif line < target:  # If the target is less than the middle line, seek to the left half of the file
                f.seek(f.tell() - len(line.encode('utf-8')) - 1)
            else:  # If the target is greater than the middle line, seek to the right half of the file
                f.seek(f.tell() + len(line.encode('utf-8')))
    return bisect_left(file, target)  # If the target is not found, return the insertion point
```

This function uses binary search to find the target in the file, and the `bisect_left` function to find the insertion point if the target is not found. The time complexity of this function is O(log(n)), where n is the number of lines in the file.

Note: This function assumes that the file is sorted in lexicographical order and that the target is a string.

Here's an example usage of the function:

```python
file_path = 'names.txt'  # Replace with the path to your file
target = 'Alice'  # Replace with the target name
position = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
print(f'The position of "{target}" in the file is: {position}')
```

This will print the position of the target in the file, or the insertion point if the target is not found.
