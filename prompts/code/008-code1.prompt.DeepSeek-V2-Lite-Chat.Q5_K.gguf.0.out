User: Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.


Assistant: 1. Bubble Sort:
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Here's a Python implementation of Bubble Sort:

```python
def bubble_sort(numbers):
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(0, len(numbers) - i - 1):
            if numbers[j] > numbers[j+1]:
                numbers[j], numbers[j+1] = numbers[j+1], numbers[j]
    return numbers

numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
print(bubble_sort(numbers))
```

2. Merge Sort:
Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945. It breaks the input into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges them. 

Here's a Python implementation of Merge Sort:

```python
def merge_sort(numbers):
    if len(numbers) > 1:
        mid = len(numbers) // 2
        left = numbers[:mid]
        right = numbers[mid:]

        # Recursive call on each half
        merge_sort(left)
        merge_sort(right)

        # Two iterators for traversing the two halves
        i = 0
        j = 0

        # Iterator for the main list
        k = 0

        while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
            if left[i] < right[j]:
                numbers[k] = left[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                numbers[k] = right[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        # For all the remaining values
        while i < len(left):
            numbers[k] = left[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1

        while j < len(right):
            numbers[k] = right[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1

numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
merge_sort(numbers)
print(numbers)
```

Comparison:
1. Bubble sort is simple and easy to understand, but it's not suitable for large datasets due to its high computational complexity (O(n^2)).

2. Merge sort is more efficient than bubble sort, with a complexity of O(n log n) in all cases (worst, average, and best). However, it requires additional space to perform the merging operation.

3. Bubble sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it doesn't require extra space beyond what's necessary to store the list itself. Merge sort, on the other hand, requires extra space equal to the original list size for the merging process.

4. Bubble sort can be optimized by stopping the algorithm if in a sweep, no swaps are made. However, this is not possible in the case of merge sort.
