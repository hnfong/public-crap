Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Bubble Sort: Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. It's simple to understand, efficient for small data sets, but not as efficient as other sorting algorithms like quicksort or mergesort, especially when the list is already partially sorted.

```python
def bubbleSort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1] :
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```
Merge Sort: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves. It's a recursive algorithm and the worst-case time complexity is O(n log n) and the average and best-case time complexity is O(n log n). Merge Sort is not as efficient as the Bubble Sort, but it is easy to understand and can be used for small to medium-sized datasets.

```python
def mergeSort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr)//2
        left_half = arr[:mid]
        right_half = arr[mid:]

        mergeSort(left_half)
        mergeSort(right_half)

        i = 0
        j = 0
        k = 0
        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
                arr[k] = left_half[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right_half[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        while i < len(left_half):
            arr[k] = left_half[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1

        while j < len(right_half):
            arr[k] = right_half[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
    return arr
```
Compare Bubble Sort and Merge Sort:

- Bubble Sort is simple and easy to implement, but it's not as efficient as Merge Sort.
- Merge Sort is a more complex algorithm, but it's more efficient for large datasets.
- Bubble sort is slow for small to medium-sized datasets, while Merge sort is faster for large datasets.

In conclusion, Bubble sort is easy to implement and understand, but it's not as efficient as Merge sort. Merge sort is a more efficient algorithm for large datasets, but it's a bit complex to understand and implement.
