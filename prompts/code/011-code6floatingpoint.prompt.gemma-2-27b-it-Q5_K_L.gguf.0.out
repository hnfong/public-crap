Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Here are the answers to your questions about IEEE 754 floating-point behavior in Python:

**Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following Python program?**

```python
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

**A1:** The eventual output of this program will be **infinity (`inf`)**.

* **Explanation:**  IEEE 754 floating-point numbers have a limited range.  As you repeatedly add 1.0 to `x`, it will eventually reach the largest representable finite floating-point number.  At that point, adding 1.0 will cause `x` to overflow and become `inf`.

**Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following Python program? Is it different from the results above?**

```python
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

**A2:** The eventual output of this program will also be **infinity (`inf`)**.

* **Explanation:** While this program uses multiplication instead of addition, the effect is similar. Multiplying by 1.001 repeatedly causes `x` to grow exponentially. Eventually, it will exceed the largest representable finite floating-point number and overflow to `inf`.

**Q3. Consider the following program:**

```python
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

**Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples if possible.**

**A3:** Yes, there are inputs that will lead to the output "Done".

* **Explanation:** The loop will continue as long as `x` is less than infinity. If the `inc` value is small enough, `x` will never reach infinity within a reasonable timeframe (or ever, due to the limitations of floating-point representation).

**Examples of inputs that will lead to "Done":**

1. **`inc = 1e-300` (a very small positive number):**  Adding such a tiny increment to `x` will cause it to increase extremely slowly. It's highly unlikely that `x` will ever reach infinity.

2. **`inc = -1.0` (a negative number):** In this case, `x` will decrease with each iteration. It will eventually become negative and continue decreasing indefinitely, never reaching infinity.
