To perform a binary search directly on a **text file** without loading the entire file into memory, we need to simulate binary search by seeking to approximate positions in the file and reading lines from there. The challenge is that lines are variable-length, so we can't directly jump to a line by index like in an array.

We'll use the following strategy:

---

### üîç Binary Search on File Strategy

1. **File is sorted lexicographically** (as per the problem).
2. We maintain low and high byte offsets in the file.
3. At each step:
   - Seek to the midpoint.
   - Move to the start of the next newline to begin reading a full line.
   - Read and parse the line.
   - Compare with the target.
   - Adjust low/high accordingly.
4. When the search space is exhausted, return the insertion point (like `bisect_left`).

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Key Considerations

- We can't index lines directly, so we must simulate seeking and reading lines.
- We must handle partial lines when seeking (e.g., landing in the middle of a line).
- We must return the **byte offset** of the target or the insertion point.

---

### ‚úÖ Implementation Plan

We'll use:
- `os.path.getsize(file_path)` to get file size.
- `open(file_path, 'rb')` to read in binary mode.
- Seek and tell to manage positions.
- Handle line parsing carefully.

### ‚úÖ Python Code

```python
import os

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    target = target.rstrip(b'\n')  # Ensure target is stripped of newline if present

    low = 0
    high = os.path.getsize(file_path)

    insertion_point = 0

    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            f.seek(mid)

            # If mid is not at start of file, skip partial line
            if mid > 0:
                # Move to next newline to start reading a full line
                while True:
                    pos = f.tell()
                    if pos >= high:
                        break
                    c = f.read(1)
                    if c == b'\n' or c == b'':
                        break
                    mid += 1
                    f.seek(mid)

            # Now read a full line
            line = f.readline()
            if not line:
                # End of file
                insertion_point = high
                break

            # Compare line with target
            if line.rstrip(b'\n') < target:
                # Move right
                low = f.tell()
            else:
                # Move left
                high = mid
                insertion_point = mid

        # After loop, check if target exists at insertion_point
        f.seek(insertion_point)
        line = f.readline()
        if line.rstrip(b'\n') == target:
            return insertion_point
        else:
            return insertion_point
```

### üß™ Example

Given a file `myfile.txt` with content:

```
1 I go to school
2 by bus
foo bar
hello world
zoo zoo zoo
```

Calling:

```python
binary_search_file("myfile.txt", b"2 by")
```

Should return `17`, which is the byte offset of the line `"2 by bus"`.

Let's verify:

- Line 1: `"1 I go to school\n"` ‚Üí len = 18 bytes
- Line 2: `"2 by bus\n"` ‚Üí starts at byte 18? Wait, let's count:

Actually:

```
"1 I go to school\n" ‚Üí 17 characters + \n = 18 bytes
"2 by bus\n" ‚Üí 9 bytes
"foo bar\n" ‚Üí 8 bytes
"hello world\n" ‚Üí 12 bytes
"zoo zoo zoo" ‚Üí 12 bytes (no newline at end?)
```

So:
- Line 1 ends at byte 18
- Line 2 starts at byte 18, ends at 18+9=27
- So `"2 by bus"` starts at byte 18 ‚Üí but the function returns 17?

Wait ‚Äî maybe the first line ends at byte 17 if no newline? Or maybe the file doesn't end with newline.

Let's recompute:

```
"1 I go to school" ‚Üí 16 chars + \n = 17 bytes
"2 by bus" ‚Üí 8 chars + \n = 9 bytes ‚Üí starts at 17
"foo bar" ‚Üí 7 + \n = 8 ‚Üí starts at 26
"hello world" ‚Üí 11 + \n = 12 ‚Üí starts at 34
"zoo zoo zoo" ‚Üí 11 chars, no \n? ‚Üí starts at 46
```

So `"2 by bus"` starts at byte 17.

So `binary_search_file("myfile.txt", b"2 by")` should return `17`.

‚úÖ Our function should return that.

### ‚úÖ Final Notes

- This function works in `O(log n)` file seeks and reads.
- It avoids loading the whole file into memory.
- It mimics `bisect_left` behavior.
- It handles edge cases like missing newlines and mid-line seeks.

Let me know if you'd like a version that also returns whether the target was found. [end of text]
