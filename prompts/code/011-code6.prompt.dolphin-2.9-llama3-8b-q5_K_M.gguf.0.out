Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

This program is attempting to increment the value of `x` by the value of `inc` indefinitely until `x` surpasses positive infinity (`math.inf`). As such, it will never reach a point where `x` is no longer less than `math.inf`. Therefore, no inputs will lead to the output "Done" in this case.

The code contains a logical error. If `x` is initially 0.0 and `inc` is a positive number, then it will keep on incrementing `x` by `inc`, but `x` will never surpass `math.inf`. The condition `x < math.inf` will always remain true, and the loop will continue indefinitely.<|im_end|>
