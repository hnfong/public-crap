Let’s analyze each question under the assumption of **IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic**, which is what Python uses for `float`.

---

### **Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following Python program?**

```python
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

#### ✅ Answer:
**The program will eventually print `inf` (infinity).**

#### 🧠 Explanation:

- `x` starts at `0.0`.
- In each iteration, `x += 1.0` adds 1.0 to `x`.
- Due to **IEEE 754 finite precision**, after a certain number of additions, `x` will eventually reach the **maximum finite float value**, which is `float('inf')` — specifically, `1.7976931348623157e+308` (approximately).

- However, **once `x` becomes `inf`**, the condition `x < math.inf` becomes **false** (since `inf < inf` is `False`), so the loop terminates.

- But wait — **what is printed?** The program prints `x` after the loop ends, which is now `inf`.

> 💡 **Important note**: In IEEE 754, `inf` is a **representable value**, and `x` will become `inf` after adding 1.0 enough times to exceed the maximum finite float. The exact number of iterations is `floor(1.7976931348623157e+308)`, which is astronomically large — but finite.

> ✅ So yes, the program **does terminate**, and prints `inf`.

---

### **Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following Python program? Is it different from the results above?**

```python
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

#### ✅ Answer:
**The program will eventually print `inf`.**

#### 🧠 Explanation:

- `x` starts at `1.0`.
- Each iteration multiplies `x` by `1.001`, so it grows exponentially: `1.001^1`, `1.001^2`, etc.
- The maximum finite float is still `~1.7976931348623157e+308`.
- The number of multiplications needed to reach `inf` is roughly `log(1.7976931348623157e+308) / log(1.001)`, which is about `log(1.7976931348623157e+308) / 0.0009995 ≈ 308 / 0.0009995 ≈ 308,000`.

- So, after about 308,000 iterations, `x` will exceed `float('inf')`, and the loop terminates.

- The program prints `x`, which is now `inf`.

> ✅ So, **same output as Q1**: `inf`.

> ❗ But wait — is it *exactly* the same? Technically, yes — both programs print `inf`. But the **reasons** are different: Q1 adds 1.0 repeatedly (linear growth), Q2 multiplies by 1.001 (exponential growth). However, both eventually overflow to `inf` and print `inf`.

### **Q3. Consider the following program:**

```python
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

#### ❓ Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples.

#### ✅ Answer:
**Yes, there are inputs that will lead to the output "Done".**

#### 🧠 Explanation:

The loop will terminate when `x` becomes `inf`, which happens when `x += inc` causes `x` to exceed the maximum finite float.

- If `inc` is **positive**, then `x` will grow and eventually overflow → loop terminates → prints "Done".

- If `inc` is **zero**, then `x` remains `0.0` forever → loop condition `x < inf` is always true → **loop never terminates** → **never prints "Done"**.

- If `inc` is **negative**, then `x` will decrease (become more negative), but `x < inf` is always true for any finite `x` — so loop **never terminates** → **never prints "Done"**.

> ✅ So, **only positive `inc` values** will eventually cause overflow to `inf` and terminate the loop.

#### 📌 Examples:

1. `inc = 1.0` → same as Q1 → eventually `x` becomes `inf` → prints "Done".

2. `inc = 0.1` → `x` increases by 0.1 each time → after ~1.7976931348623157e+307 iterations, `x` becomes `inf` → prints "Done".

> ✅ So, **any positive float `inc`** will work.

#### ❗ What about very small `inc`?

Even `inc = 1e-308` will eventually cause `x` to grow to `inf`, because:

- The maximum finite float is ~1.7976931348623157e+308.
- So, number of steps = `1.7976931348623157e+308 / 1e-308 = 1.7976931348623157e+616` — which is **way beyond** the number of bits in a float, but **still finite**.

> ✅ So, even tiny positive `inc` values will eventually cause overflow.

#### ❗ What about `inc = 0.0` or `inc = -1.0`?

- `inc = 0.0`: `x` never changes → loop runs forever → **never prints "Done"**.
- `inc = -1.0`: `x` decreases → `x` becomes negative → `x < inf` is always true → loop runs forever → **never prints "Done"**.
