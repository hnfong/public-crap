To perform a binary search directly on a text file in **O(log n)** time, we need to treat the file as a sorted list of lines, but without loading the entire file into memory. The key is to use **random access** via `seek()` and `read()` to jump to byte positions and extract lines efficiently.

### Key Challenges:
- Lines are variable-length, so we can't directly compute the byte offset of the nth line.
- We need to **find the start and end of a line** when we land in the middle of one.
- We must handle edge cases like empty lines or EOF.

### Strategy:
1. **Binary search on byte positions** (not line numbers).
2. When we `seek()` to a mid-point, we may land in the middle of a line. So we:
   - Read forward until we find a newline (`\n`) to get the **start of the next line**.
   - Read that full line and compare it with the target.
3. Use `bisect_left` logic: if the target is not found, return the byte position where it should be inserted.

### Python Implementation

```python
import os

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    """
    Perform a binary search on a text file sorted lexicographically.
    Returns the byte offset where the target line starts, or the insertion point.
    """
    target = target.rstrip(b'\n')  # Normalize target
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        left = 0
        right = os.fstat(f.fileno()).st_size  # File size in bytes

        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            f.seek(mid)

            # Ensure we are at the start of a line
            if mid > 0:
                f.readline()  # Discard partial line

            line_start = f.tell()
            line = f.readline()
            if not line:
                # EOF reached, treat as empty string
                line = b''

            line = line.rstrip(b'\n')

            if line < target:
                left = f.tell()
            else:
                right = mid

        return left
```

---

### Explanation:
- `left` and `right` are byte offsets.
- `f.readline()` after `seek(mid)` ensures we always read from the **start of a line**.
- The loop narrows down the insertion point using standard binary search logic.
- The final `left` is the **byte offset** where the target line would be inserted (or where it already exists).

---

### Example:
Given the file:

```
1 I go to school\n
2 by bus\n
foo bar\n
hello world\n
zoo zoo zoo\n
```

- `binary_search_file("myfile.txt", b"2 by")` returns **17**, which is the byte offset of the line `2 by bus`.

---

### Notes:
- This assumes the file is sorted **lexicographically by full line**.
- The function returns the **byte offset** of the line (or insertion point), not the line number.
- It uses **binary search on bytes**, not lines, so it's **O(log n)** in terms of file size, not number of lines â€” but since lines are roughly evenly distributed, it's effectively **O(log n)** in practice. [end of text]
