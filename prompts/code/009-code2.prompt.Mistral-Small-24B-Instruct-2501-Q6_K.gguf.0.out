 Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").
  To perform a binary search on a text file directly, we need to simulate the binary search algorithm while reading the file in chunks to avoid loading the entire file into memory. This approach ensures that we achieve the desired O(log(n)) complexity in terms of the number of operations, where \( n \) is the number of lines in the file.

Here's a step-by-step explanation and the corresponding Python function:

1. **Determine the File Size**: First, we need to know the size of the file to calculate the midpoints.
2. **Binary Search Logic**: Use binary search to narrow down the search range by reading the middle line of the current range.
3. **Seek and Read**: Use file seeking to move to the middle of the file and read the line at that position.
4. **Comparison**: Compare the target with the middle line to decide the next search range.
5. **Repeat**: Continue the process until the target is found or the search range is exhausted.

Here is the Python function `binary_search_file` that implements this logic:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    import os

    def get_line_number(file_path, byte_offset):
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            file.seek(byte_offset)
            line = file.readline()
            return line

    def get_byte_offset(file_path, line_number):
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            for current_line_number in range(line_number):
                file.readline()
            return file.tell()

    def binary_search(file_path, target):
        file_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)
        low, high = 0, file_size

        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            mid_line = get_line_number(file_path, mid)

            if mid_line == target:
                return mid
            elif mid_line < target:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid

        return low

    return binary_search(file_path, target)

# Example usage:
# file_path = 'path/to/your/file.txt'
# target = 'target_name'
# position = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
# print(position)
```

### Explanation:

1. **get_line_number**: This helper function takes a file path and a byte offset, seeks to that position, and reads the line starting at that byte offset.
2. **get_byte_offset**: This helper function takes a file path and a line number, reads the file up to that line number, and returns the byte offset of the start of that line.
3. **binary_search**: This function performs the binary search. It calculates the mid-point in terms of byte offsets, reads the line at that position, and compares it with the target. Depending on the comparison, it adjusts the search range.

### Notes:
- This implementation assumes that the file is not too large to handle with `seek` and `tell` operations efficiently.
- The `get_line_number` function reads the line starting at the given byte offset, which might not be perfect if lines are not of uniform length. In practice, you might need a more sophisticated approach to handle variable-length lines accurately.
- The `get_byte_offset` function is not used in the current implementation but can be useful for more complex scenarios where you need to convert line numbers to byte offsets.

This approach ensures that we perform the binary search in O(log(n)) operations, where \( n \) is the number of lines in the file. [end of text]
