Alright, I need to create a JavaScript poker game that can run locally in a browser, using only vanilla JavaScript. The game should be a standard poker game for a single player. The requirements are quite specific: no network requests, must be self-contained, and the code should be concise with minimal indentation to save tokens. Additionally, the output must be in HTML, embedding the JavaScript within a `<script>` tag, and the very first line should be `<!DOCTYPE html><html>`.

First, I'll start by setting up the basic HTML structure. I'll need a `<head>` section where I'll include the necessary meta tags and a `<body>` section where the game will reside. Since the game is single-player and runs locally, I don't need any external resources or network requests, so I can keep the HTML straightforward.

Next, for the JavaScript part, I'll need to handle the game logic. A standard poker game involves dealing cards, managing the player's hand, and determining the winner based on the hand's strength. However, since it's a single-player game, I'll need to simulate the dealer's actions and perhaps provide some feedback or outcomes based on the player's hand.

To keep the code concise and reduce indentation, I'll aim for a clean and efficient structure. I'll use event listeners to handle user interactions, such as dealing cards or checking the hand's strength. I'll also need to manage the game state, keeping track of the player's hand, the community cards, and the current round's status.

Since the game must run locally, I'll ensure that all assets, such as card images or styles, are included within the HTML file or are accessible from the local filesystem. I'll avoid using any external libraries or frameworks to keep the dependencies minimal.

Finally, I'll test the game thoroughly to ensure that all functionalities work as expected without any network issues. I'll make sure that the game is responsive and provides a smooth user experience, even though it's a simple implementation.

Overall, the key is to balance functionality with conciseness, ensuring that the game is both playable and efficient, adhering strictly to the provided requirements.
