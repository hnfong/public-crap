Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Remember to answer all the questions

Q1.

Q1. The eventual output of the first Python program is undefined. The reason is that the while loop condition `x < math.inf` is always true because `math.inf` represents positive infinity, and `x` is initially set to 0.0. Since `x` is being incremented by 1.0 in each iteration, it will never reach infinity, but the loop will continue indefinitely. Therefore, the program will not terminate and will not produce an output.

Q2. The eventual output of the second Python program is also undefined for the same reason as the first program. The loop condition `x < math.inf` is always true, and `x` is being multiplied by 1.001 in each iteration. This multiplication will not cause `x` to reach infinity, but the loop will continue indefinitely, and the program will not terminate or produce an output.

Q3. There are inputs that will lead to the output "Done". The program will terminate when `x` reaches or exceeds `math.inf`. This can happen if the increment `inc` is large enough such that `x + inc` reaches infinity in a finite number of iterations. Here are two examples of such inputs:

1. If the user enters `inc = 1e308`, then after approximately 2^53 iterations, `x` will reach infinity, and the program will print "Done".
2. If the user enters `inc = 1e309`, then after approximately 2^53 iterations, `x` will reach infinity, and the program will print "Done".

Note that the exact number of iterations needed to reach infinity will depend on the specific implementation of the floating-point arithmetic in the Python interpreter. However, the above examples demonstrate that there are inputs that will cause the program to terminate successfully.
