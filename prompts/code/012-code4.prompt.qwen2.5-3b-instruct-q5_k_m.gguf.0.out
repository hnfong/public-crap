What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)

The given Python program attempts to print the value of `x` after an infinite loop. However, the loop will never terminate because `math.inf` (infinity) is not a finite number, and the condition `x < math.inf` will always be true.

Here is a breakdown of the program:

1. `x = 0.0` initializes `x` to 0.0.
2. `while x < math.inf:` starts an infinite loop because `math.inf` is not a finite number.
3. `x += 1.0` increments `x` by 1.0 in each iteration.
4. `print(x)` prints the current value of `x` after each iteration.

Since the loop is infinite, `x` will keep increasing without bound. Therefore, the output will be a very large number, but it will never be printed because the program will continue running indefinitely.

In practice, this program will run until the system runs out of resources or the program is manually stopped. The exact value of `x` when the program is stopped is not determinable without knowing the exact stopping point.

Here is the code for reference:

```python
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

The output will be a very large number, but it will not be printed. [end of text]
