To perform a binary search on a text file with names sorted lexicographically, we need to access specific lines in the file without reading the entire file into memory. This can be achieved by first determining the length of each line and then calculating the byte offsets for the middle elements during the binary search process.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Determine the total number of lines in the file**: This can be done by reading the file once and counting the lines.
2. **Calculate the byte offsets for each line**: This involves reading the file again to record the starting byte position of each line. This allows us to seek to any line directly.
3. **Perform binary search using byte offsets**: For each middle index calculated during the binary search, use the precomputed byte offsets to seek to the correct position in the file and read the line for comparison.

### Python Function Implementation

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Step 1: Count the total number of lines
        file.seek(0, 2)  # Move to the end of the file
        file_size = file.tell()
        file.seek(0)
        
        # Binary search to find the number of lines
        low = 0
        high = file_size
        line_count = 0
        while low < high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            file.seek(mid)
            # Move to the start of the line
            if mid > 0:
                file.seek(mid - 1)
                while file.read(1) != '\n' and file.tell() > 0:
                    file.seek(file.tell() - 2)
            # Read the line
            line = file.readline().strip()
            if line:
                line_count = (file.tell() - mid)  # Approximate line length
                high = mid
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        
        # Now, perform binary search on the lines
        low = 0
        high = line_count - 1
        result = -1
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            # Seek to the start of the mid line
            file.seek(0)
            for _ in range(mid):
                file.readline()
            line = file.readline().strip()
            if line < target:
                low = mid + 1
            elif line > target:
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                return mid  # Found the target
        
        # If not found, return the insertion point (bisect_left)
        return low
```

### Explanation

1. **Counting Lines**: The initial part of the function counts the number of lines in the file by seeking to the end and then using a binary search to estimate the number of lines. This is a bit tricky because we don't know the line lengths beforehand.
2. **Binary Search on Lines**: Once we have an estimate of the number of lines, we perform a standard binary search. For each middle index, we seek to the start of that line (by reading lines sequentially up to that point) and compare the line with the target.
3. **Insertion Point**: If the target is not found, the function returns the position where the target should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, similar to `bisect_left`.

### Note

This approach assumes that the file is small enough that reading lines sequentially up to the middle index during each binary search step is feasible. For very large files, a more efficient method would involve precomputing the byte offsets for each line, but this would require an additional pass through the file to build an index. The provided solution is a balance between simplicity and efficiency for moderate-sized files. [end of text]
