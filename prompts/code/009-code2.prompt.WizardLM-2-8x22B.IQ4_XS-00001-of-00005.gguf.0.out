 To perform a binary search on a file directly, we need to be able to access random positions in the file efficiently. This is because a binary search algorithm requires us to jump to the middle of the current search interval, read the data at that position, and then decide whether to continue searching in the first half or the second half of the file.

However, files are not like arrays in memory; they are sequences of bytes, and finding the middle of a text file is not straightforward because lines can have variable lengths. To efficiently perform a binary search, we would need to have fixed-size records or some form of indexing that allows us to quickly locate the middle line.

Since the problem statement does not mention such an index, we will have to make some assumptions. We will assume that the file is not too large to fit into memory, which allows us to read the entire file into memory and perform the binary search there. If the file were too large to fit into memory, we would need to create an external index or use a database system designed for this kind of operation.

Here's a Python function that reads the file into memory and performs a binary search on the lines of the file:

```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    # Read the file into memory
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        lines = f.readlines()

    # Convert byte lines to strings for comparison
    lines = [line.strip() for line in lines]

    # Perform a binary search on the list of lines
    target_bytes = target if isinstance(target, bytes) else target.encode('utf-8')
    index = bisect.bisect_left(lines, target_bytes)

    # Find the byte position of the target or insertion point
    pos = 0
    for i, line in enumerate(lines):
        if i == index:
            break
        pos += len(line) + 1  # +1 for the newline character

    # Adjust for the case where the target is at the beginning of the file
    if index == 0:
        return pos

    # If the target was not found, index points to the insertion point
    # Adjust pos to point to the beginning of the line where the target should be inserted
    if index == len(lines):
        return pos + len(lines[-1]) + 1  # +1 for the newline character
    else:
        return pos

# Example usage:
position = binary_search_file("myfile.txt", "2 by")
print(position)  # Should print the byte position where "2 by" would be inserted
```

This function reads the entire file into memory, which may not be efficient for very large files. It then performs a binary search on the list of lines in memory. The `bisect_left` function is used to find the insertion point for the target, and the byte position is calculated by summing the lengths of the lines preceding the insertion point.

Please note that this implementation assumes that the file is encoded in UTF-8 and that the newline characters are one byte long (as in ASCII). If the file uses a different encoding or has multi-byte newline characters (such as `\r\n` in Windows), the function would need to be adjusted accordingly. [end of text]
