 Performing a binary search on a file with sorted lines is similar to performing a binary search on a sorted list in memory, but with the added complexity of file I/O. The key is to seek to different positions in the file rather than accessing elements by index as you would in a list.

Here's a Python function that implements binary search on a file:

```python
import os

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    # Get the size of the file
    file_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)
    
    # Initialize the start and end pointers
    start = 0
    end = file_size
    
    # Perform binary search
    while start < end:
        # Calculate the middle position
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        mid_char = '\n' if mid == 0 else file_path.read(mid, 1)
        
        # Seek to the middle position in the file
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            file.seek(mid)
            # Read the line at the middle position
            line = file.readline()
            
            # If the line is empty, it means we are at the start of the file or a line boundary
            if not line.strip() or file.tell() == 0:
                # Move the start pointer to the next line
                start = file.tell()
                continue
            
            # Compare the target with the middle line
            if line < target:
                start = file.tell()
            elif line > target:
                end = mid
            else:
                # Found the target, return the position
                return file.tell() - len(line)
        
        # Adjust the search range
        if start == end:
            break
    
    # If not found, return the insertion point
    return start

# Example usage:
# Assuming 'names.txt' is a file with sorted names, one per line
# position = binary_search_file('names.txt', 'John Doe\n')
# print(position)
```

This function works by seeking to the middle of the file and reading the line at that position. Depending on the comparison between the read line and the target, it adjusts the search range accordingly. The search continues until the target is found or the search range cannot be narrowed further.

The function returns the position in the file where the target should be inserted, which is the same as the `bisect_left` function in Python's `bisect` module.

Please note that this function assumes that the file is not being modified by another process while the search is in progress. Concurrent file access could lead to race conditions and incorrect results. Additionally, the function assumes that each line in the file is terminated by a newline character (`\n`), which is standard for Unix-like systems. If the file uses a different line ending (e.g., `\r\n` for Windows), you may need to adjust the line reading logic accordingly. [end of text]
