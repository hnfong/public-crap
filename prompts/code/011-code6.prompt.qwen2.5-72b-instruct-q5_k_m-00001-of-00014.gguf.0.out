Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

The given program will only print "Done" if the loop terminates. However, the loop condition `while x < math.inf:` will always be true because `math.inf` represents positive infinity, and `x` will keep increasing by `inc` indefinitely. Therefore, the loop will never terminate for any finite positive value of `inc`.

However, there are a few edge cases to consider:

1. **If `inc` is 0**:
   - If the user inputs `0`, then `x` will never change, and the loop will run indefinitely because `x` will always be `0.0`, which is less than `math.inf`.

2. **If `inc` is a negative number**:
   - If the user inputs a negative number, `x` will keep decreasing and will never reach or exceed `math.inf`. Therefore, the loop will also run indefinitely.

3. **If `inc` is `math.inf`**:
   - If the user inputs `math.inf`, then `x` will be incremented by `math.inf` in the first iteration, making `x` equal to `math.inf`. The loop condition `x < math.inf` will then be false, and the loop will terminate. The program will print "Done".

4. **If `inc` is `NaN` (Not a Number)**:
   - If the user inputs `NaN`, then `x` will be incremented by `NaN` in the first iteration. Since `NaN` is not less than `math.inf`, the loop condition will be false, and the loop will terminate. The program will print "Done".

### Examples of Inputs that Lead to "Done":
1. **Input: `math.inf`**
   - After the first iteration, `x` will be `math.inf`, and the loop will terminate.
   - Output: "Done"

2. **Input: `NaN`**
   - After the first iteration, `x` will be `NaN`, and the loop will terminate.
   - Output: "Done"

These are the only inputs that will lead to the output "Done" because they cause the loop condition to become false in the first iteration. [end of text]
