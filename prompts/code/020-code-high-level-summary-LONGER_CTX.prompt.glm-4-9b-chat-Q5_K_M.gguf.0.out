This source code file appears to be part of a larger system that deals with the parsing and representation of multilingual definitions and examples. Here's a high-level overview of what it does:

1. **Parsing Definitions**: The code defines a `MultilingualDefinition` class that can parse strings containing definitions of words or phrases in multiple languages. It can handle tags that indicate the part of speech, labels, and other metadata.

2. **Handling Tags and Labels**: The code defines a set of recognized tags and labels, such as "pos" for part of speech, "label" for labels like "cuss word" or "slang", and "sim" for similar words. It also provides validation functions for these tags.

3. **Storing and Retrieving Information**: The code allows for the storage and retrieval of definitions, examples, and explanations in multiple languages. It provides methods to serialize and deserialize these objects into different formats, such as JSON.

4. **Formatting and Display**: The code includes functions to format explanations and examples for display, such as converting references to words into clickable links.

5. **Language Handling**: The code includes functions to handle language codes and determine the language of a given string.

6. **Error Handling**: The code includes custom exception classes for handling errors such as invalid jyutping, missing items, and illegal characters.

Overall, this code seems to be part of a system that could be used to build a dictionary or a language learning tool, providing definitions, examples, and explanations of words and phrases in multiple languages.
