To solve this problem, we need to convert a given integer into a compact, human-readable string representation with at most 4 characters. The solution involves rounding the number to the nearest significant digits and appending an appropriate suffix (like 'K' for thousands, 'M' for millions, etc.) while ensuring the total string length does not exceed 4 characters.

### Approach
1. **Determine the Suffix**: Based on the magnitude of the number, decide the appropriate suffix. For example:
   - Numbers less than 1000 do not require a suffix.
   - Numbers between 1000 and 999,999 are represented in thousands (suffix 'K').
   - Numbers between 1,000,000 and 999,999,999 are represented in millions (suffix 'M').
   - Numbers 1,000,000,000 and above are represented in billions (suffix 'B').

2. **Scale the Number**: Divide the number by the base value (1000 for thousands, 1,000,000 for millions, etc.) to get a floating-point value.

3. **Format the Number**: 
   - If the number is less than 1000, return it as a string without any decimal places.
   - For larger numbers, we need to format the scaled value to have at most 3 digits (including the integer part and possibly one decimal digit) to ensure the total string length (including the suffix) is at most 4 characters.
   - Check if the scaled value rounded to the nearest integer has 3 digits. If so, we cannot have a decimal point as it would exceed the 4-character limit (e.g., 123K is 4 characters, but 123.4K is 6). Therefore, we should round to the nearest integer and represent without a decimal.
   - If the scaled value has 2 integer digits, we can have one decimal digit (e.g., 9.4M is 3 characters which is within the limit). However, if rounding to one decimal digit results in 3 integer digits (e.g., 99.9 rounded to 100), we should adjust to avoid the decimal point.

4. **Rounding and Conversion**: 
   - For numbers requiring a suffix, first round the scaled value to one decimal place. Then check the length of the integer part. If the integer part has 3 digits, we round to the nearest integer and return without decimal. If the integer part has 2 digits, we check if the rounded value with one decimal digit would still have 2 integer digits. If so, we return with one decimal digit. However, if the rounded value becomes 100.0 or more, we adjust the magnitude (e.g., 1000K becomes 1M).

### Solution Code
```python
def abbrev_num(x):
    if x < 1000:
        return str(x)
    elif x < 1000000:
        n = x / 1000.0
        rounded = round(n, 1)
        if rounded >= 1000:
            return abbrev_num(1000000)
        if rounded.is_integer():
            return str(int(rounded)) + 'K'
        s = str(rounded)
        if len(s) > 4:
            rounded = round(n)
            if rounded >= 1000:
                return '1M'
            return str(int(rounded)) + 'K'
        return s.replace('.', '') + 'K' if len(s) == 3 and s[-1] == '0' else s.rstrip('0').rstrip('.') + 'K'
    elif x < 1000000000:
        n = x / 1000000.0
        rounded = round(n, 1)
        if rounded >= 1000:
            return abbrev_num(1000000000)
        if rounded.is_integer():
            return str(int(rounded)) + 'M'
        s = str(rounded)
        if len(s) > 4:
            rounded = round(n)
            if rounded >= 1000:
                return '1B'
            return str(int(rounded)) + 'M'
        return s.replace('.', '') + 'M' if len(s) == 3 and s[-1] == '0' else s.rstrip('0').rstrip('.') + 'M'
    else:
        n = x / 1000000000.0
        rounded = round(n, 1)
        if rounded >= 1000:
            return '1000B'
        if rounded.is_integer():
            return str(int(rounded)) + 'B'
        s = str(rounded)
        if len(s) > 4:
            rounded = round(n)
            if rounded >= 1000:
                return '1000B'
            return str(int(rounded)) + 'B'
        return s.replace('.', '') + 'B' if len(s) == 3 and s[-1] == '0' else s.rstrip('0').rstrip('.') + 'B'
```

### Explanation
1. **Handling Small Numbers**: For numbers less than 1000, simply return the string representation of the number.
2. **Thousands (K)**: For numbers between 1000 and 999,999, scale by 1000. Round to one decimal place. If the rounded value is an integer, return without decimal. Check if the string representation exceeds 4 characters; if so, round to the nearest integer. Adjust if the rounded value reaches 1000 (then it should be represented as 1M).
3. **Millions (M) and Billions (B)**: Similar to thousands but scale by 1,000,000 and 1,000,000,000 respectively. The same checks for string length and rounding are applied to ensure the output does not exceed 4 characters.
4. **String Formatting**: For numbers with one decimal digit, remove trailing zeros and the decimal point if unnecessary to save characters. For example, 8.0K becomes 8K.

This approach ensures that the output string is compact and human-readable, adhering to the 4-character constraint while accurately representing the number's magnitude. [end of text]
