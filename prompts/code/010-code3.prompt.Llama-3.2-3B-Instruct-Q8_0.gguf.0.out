The intended purpose of the given Python function is to partition the input list `a` into three parts: elements less than or equal to the first element `p`, elements greater than `p`, and the first element itself.

Here's a review of the code:

1.  The function is recursive, which can be inefficient for large lists due to the overhead of recursive function calls. It's better to use iteration instead.

2.  The function does not handle the case where the input list is empty. It should return an empty list in this case.

3.  The function does not handle the case where the input list contains non-comparable elements (e.g., non-numeric elements). It should either convert all elements to a comparable type or handle this case explicitly.

4.  The function does not handle the case where the input list contains duplicate elements. It should either remove duplicates or handle this case explicitly.

5.  The function does not have a docstring, which makes it harder for users to understand its purpose and usage.

Here's a revised version of the function in Rust:

```rust
fn partition(a: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    if a.is_empty() {
        return vec![];
    }

    let mut p = a[0];
    let mut less_than_p = vec![];
    let mut greater_than_p = vec![];

    for x in a.iter().skip(1) {
        if x <= p {
            less_than_p.push(*x);
        } else {
            greater_than_p.push(*x);
        }
    }

    less_than_p.push(p);
    less_than_p.append(&mut greater_than_p);

    less_than_p
}
```

This Rust version of the function uses iteration instead of recursion, handles the edge case of an empty input list, and uses the `iter()` method to iterate over the input vector. It also uses the `push()` method to add elements to the `less_than_p` and `greater_than_p` vectors. The `append()` method is used to combine the two vectors into a single vector. The function returns the partitioned vector.

Note that this Rust version assumes that all elements in the input vector are comparable (i.e., they can be compared using the `<` operator). If the input vector contains non-comparable elements, you would need to modify the function accordingly. [end of text]
