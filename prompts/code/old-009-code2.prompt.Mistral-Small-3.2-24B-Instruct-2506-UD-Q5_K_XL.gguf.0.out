To perform a binary search on a file directly, we need to read the file in chunks rather than loading the entire file into memory. This approach is efficient for large files as it minimizes memory usage. Here's a step-by-step discussion and the corresponding Python function:

### Approach
1. **Open the File**: Open the file in read mode.
2. **Determine File Size**: Get the size of the file to manage the reading process.
3. **Binary Search**: Implement the binary search algorithm, but instead of accessing elements by index, we will read specific lines from the file based on the current search range.
4. **Read Lines Efficiently**: For each step in the binary search, read the line at the middle position of the current search range. This involves seeking to the appropriate position in the file and reading the line.
5. **Compare and Adjust Range**: Compare the target with the middle line to adjust the search range (high or low).
6. **Return Result**: Once the search is complete, return the position where the target is found or the insertion point.

### Solution Code
```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Get the total number of lines in the file
        file.seek(0, 2)  # Seek to the end of the file
        file_size = file.tell()
        file.seek(0, 0)  # Seek back to the beginning of the file

        low = 0
        high = count_lines(file_path) - 1

        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            # Seek to the mid line
            line_position = find_line_position(file, mid)
            file.seek(line_position)
            current_line = file.readline().strip()

            if current_line == target:
                return mid
            elif current_line < target:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1

        return low

def count_lines(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        count = 0
        for _ in file:
            count += 1
        return count

def find_line_position(file, line_number):
    position = 0
    current_line = 0
    while current_line < line_number:
        file.seek(position)
        line = file.readline()
        if not line:
            break
        position = file.tell()
        current_line += 1
    return position
```

### Explanation
1. **count_lines**: This helper function counts the total number of lines in the file by iterating through each line once. This is necessary to set the initial high bound for the binary search.
2. **find_line_position**: This helper function finds the byte position of a specific line in the file. It seeks to the start of the file and reads each line until it reaches the desired line number, keeping track of the current position.
3. **binary_search_file**: This function performs the binary search:
   - It opens the file and initializes the low and high bounds for the search.
   - In each iteration of the binary search, it calculates the middle position, seeks to the corresponding line, and reads the line.
   - It compares the read line with the target to adjust the search range.
   - If the target is found, it returns the line number; otherwise, it returns the insertion point (low) where the target should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

This approach ensures that the binary search is performed efficiently with O(log(n)) operations, and it handles large files by reading only necessary parts of the file into memory. [end of text]
