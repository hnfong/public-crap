Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

The program is designed to continuously add the input number `inc` to the variable `x` until `x` becomes greater than `math.inf`. However, it is important to note that `math.inf` is not a real number, it is a special constant that represents positive infinity. It is not possible to add a finite number to `math.inf` because `math.inf` is not a number that can be changed.

Therefore, it is not possible to input a number that will make `x` greater than `math.inf` and thus make the program stop. The loop will run indefinitely without reaching `x` greater than `math.inf`.

However, if the input is a very large number, the program may run for a very long time before exceeding the maximum limit of the data type `float`. For example:

1. If the input is `1e308`, the program will run for a very long time before exceeding the maximum limit of `float`.

2. If the input is `1e309`, the program will run for even longer before exceeding the maximum limit of `float`.

Please note that the above inputs are not guaranteed to cause the program to stop, as the maximum limit of `float` is not known beforehand.
