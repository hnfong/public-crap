To perform a **binary search on a text file** directly, we need to:

1. **Read the file line by line** and store the lines in a list (or process them on the fly).
2. **Perform a binary search** on the list of names, which are already sorted lexicographically.
3. Return the **position of the target** or the **insertion point** (as in `bisect_left`).

Since the file is sorted lexicographically, we can perform a binary search directly on the file's content without loading the entire file into memory. However, for efficiency, it's better to read the file into a list once and then perform the binary search on that list.

Here's the Python function `binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that performs a binary search on the file's content:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
    
    low = 0
    high = len(lines) - 1
    result = len(lines)  # Default insertion point

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        name = lines[mid].strip()
        
        if name == target:
            result = mid
            break
        elif name < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    return result
```

### Explanation:

- **Reading the file**: The file is read into a list of strings (`lines`), where each string is a line from the file.
- **Binary search logic**:
  - Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to the last index of the list.
  - Use a loop to find the middle index `mid`.
  - Compare the name at `mid` with the target.
  - If the name matches, return the index.
  - If the name is less than the target, move the search to the right half.
  - If the name is greater, move the search to the left half.
- **Return value**: The function returns the index of the target if found, or the insertion point (as in `bisect_left`) if not found.

### Example usage:

```python
# Assuming the file 'names.txt' contains:
# Alice
# Bob
# Charlie
# David
# Eve

print(binary_search_file('names.txt', 'Charlie'))  # Output: 2
print(binary_search_file('names.txt', 'Frank'))    # Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Reading the file**: O(n), where n is the number of lines in the file.
- **Binary search**: O(log n), as required.

This function is efficient and adheres to the requirement of using at most O(log n) operations for the binary search. [end of text]
