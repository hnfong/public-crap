What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
The output of the following Python program will be `inf`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Initialization**: `x` is initialized to `1.0`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `x < math.inf`.
3. **Loop Body**: Inside the loop, `x` is multiplied by `1.001`.

Initially, `x` is `1.0`. Each iteration of the loop multiplies `x` by `1.001`, which means `x` grows exponentially. Eventually, `x` will exceed any finite value and reach `math.inf` (infinity).

When `x` reaches `math.inf`, the condition `x < math.inf` will be false, and the loop will terminate.

The final value of `x` will be `inf`, which is printed out.

So, the output of the program is:

```
inf
