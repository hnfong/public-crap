**Q1.**

In IEEE 754 floating-point representation, the maximum finite value that can be represented is approximately 1.7976931348623157e+308. This value is often referred to as `float('inf')` in Python, but it's not exactly infinity. It's the largest finite value that can be represented.

When `x` reaches this maximum value, adding 1.0 to it will not change its value, because the result would exceed the maximum representable value. In IEEE 754, this operation is defined to produce the same maximum value, not infinity.

Therefore, the loop will eventually terminate when `x` reaches the maximum finite value, and the output will be approximately `1.7976931348623157e+308`.

**Note:** The actual output might be slightly different due to rounding errors, but it will be very close to this value.
