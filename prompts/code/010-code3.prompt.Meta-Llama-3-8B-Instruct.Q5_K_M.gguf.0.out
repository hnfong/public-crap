Consider the following python code:

```
def s(a):
    if len(a) <= 1: return a
    p = a[0]
    l = [x for x in a[1:] if x <= p]
    r = [x for x in a[1:] if x > p]
    return l + [p,] + r
```

What is its intended purpose? Then, please review the code, focusing on mistakes (if any), coding style, efficiency, and any other implementation details that may be of note. Finally, write a new function with all your suggested fixes/improvements, but in the Rust language (not in python).

The intended purpose of this function is to sort an array by inserting a pivot element into its correct position. The pivot element is the first element of the array, and the array is then divided into two parts: elements less than the pivot and elements greater than the pivot. The function recursively sorts these two parts and then combines them with the pivot in the middle.

The code has several issues:

1. It does not handle duplicate values correctly. If there are duplicate values in the array, the function may not correctly partition the array into two parts.

2. It uses list comprehensions which are not the most efficient way to create lists in Python. It would be better to use the append method to add elements to the list.

3. The function does not handle arrays with more than one element correctly. For arrays with more than one element, it does not recursively sort the subarrays.

4. The function does not handle arrays with less than two elements correctly. For arrays with less than two elements, it should return the array as it is, since it is already sorted.

5. The function does not handle arrays with an empty array correctly. For arrays with an empty array, it should return an empty array.

Here is a new function in Rust that addresses these issues:

```rust
fn sort_by_pivot(a: &mut [i32]) {
    if a.len() <= 1 {
        return;
    }
    let p = a[0];
    let mut l = 0;
    let mut r = a.len() - 1;
    let mut i = 1;
    while i <= r {
        if a[i] <= p {
            l += 1;
            a.swap(l, i);
            i += 1;
        } else {
            r -= 1;
            a.swap(i, r);
        }
    }
    a.swap(l, 0);
    let mut left = &mut a[..l];
    let mut right = &mut a[(l + 1)..];
    sort_by_pivot(left);
    sort_by_pivot(right);
}
```

This function sorts the array by recursively partitioning the array around the pivot element. It uses the swap method of the slice type to move elements to their correct positions. The left and right parts of the array are then recursively sorted.
