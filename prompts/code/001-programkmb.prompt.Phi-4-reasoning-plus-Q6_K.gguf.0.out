We are asked: "Task: write a complete single-file Java program using only the standard library (can only import packages in the java.* namespace). The spec for the program is as follows: ...". The program reads a string from standard input (can contain multiple lines), extracts all numbers followed by optional suffixes (k, K, m, M, g, G), converts them to their base value (kilo=1024, M=1024*1024, etc.), calculates their sum, and prints the total sum as well as the sum in kilobytes (K), megabytes (M), and gigabytes (G) to one decimal place.

The program handles numbers with commas as thousand separators and supports both lowercase and uppercase suffixes.

Example input:
```
1.5G, 2K,
3M, and 4.2G
500,000K and 600M
```
Example output:
```
7264621772.8
7094357.2 k
6928.1 M
6.8 G
```

We need to produce a complete single-file Java program that uses only standard library packages (only java.* packages allowed). We need to produce a production-ready code. We need to produce a complete program that reads from standard input, extracts numbers with optional suffixes, converts them to base value, calculates sum, and prints the total sum as well as the sum in kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes to one decimal place.

Let's analyze the problem:

We need to read input from standard input. The input can contain multiple lines. We need to extract all numbers with optional suffixes. The numbers can have commas as thousand separators. The suffixes are: k, K, m, M, g, G. The conversion factors: k or K means kilobyte = 1024 bytes, m or M means megabyte = 1024*1024 bytes, g or G means gigabyte = 1024*1024*1024 bytes. But the problem statement says "extracts all numbers followed by optional suffixes (k, K, m, M, g, G), converts them to their base value (kilo=1024, M=1024*1024, etc.)". Wait, check: "k, K" means kilobyte? But then "M" means megabyte? But then "G" means gigabyte? But the problem statement says "k, K, m, M, g, G" but then "kilo=1024, M=1024*1024, etc." So the conversion factors are: if suffix is k or K, then multiply by 1024. If suffix is m or M, then multiply by 1024*1024. If suffix is g or G, then multiply by 1024*1024*1024. But wait, the problem statement says "extracts all numbers followed by optional suffixes (k, K, m, M, g, G)". But then "k, K" are ambiguous: sometimes "k" stands for kilobyte, but sometimes "k" stands for thousand. But the problem statement says "k, K, m, M, g, G" and then "kilo=1024, M=1024*1024, etc." So it's not thousand separators, it's binary multiples. So we assume that if there's no suffix, then it's just a number with no multiplier? But the problem statement says "extracts all numbers followed by optional suffixes", so maybe the number might not have a suffix? But the example input always has a suffix. But the problem statement says "optional suffixes", so maybe sometimes the number might not have a suffix. But then what is the base unit? Possibly bytes? But the problem statement says "converts them to their base value (kilo=1024, M=1024*1024, etc.)". It might be that if there's no suffix, then it's just the number itself. But the problem statement says "extracts all numbers followed by optional suffixes", so maybe the suffix is optional. But then the conversion factors: if suffix is k or K, then multiply by 1024. If suffix is m or M, then multiply by 1024*1024. If suffix is g or G, then multiply by 1024*1024*1024. But then what if there's no suffix? Possibly then it's just the number itself. But the problem statement says "extracts all numbers followed by optional suffixes", so maybe the suffix is optional. But then the conversion factors: if no suffix, then it's just the number itself. But the problem statement says "converts them to their base value", which might be interpreted as "converts them to bytes" if they have a suffix. But then the output is printed as "total sum" and then "sum in kilobytes (K)", "sum in megabytes (M)", "sum in gigabytes (G)". So the total sum is in bytes. And then the conversion to kilobytes is total sum / 1024, etc.

Wait, check the example: Input: "1.5G, 2K, 3M, and 4.2G 500,000K and 600M". Let's compute: 1.5G = 1.5 * 1024^3 = 1.5 * 1073741824 = 1610612736 bytes? Let's compute: 1.5 * 1073741824 = 1610612736. Then 2K = 2 * 1024 = 2048 bytes. Then 3M = 3 * 1024^2 = 3 * 1048576 = 3145728 bytes. Then 4.2G = 4.2 * 1073741824 = 4513884800? Let's compute: 4.2 * 1073741824 = 4513884800? Let's check: 4 * 1073741824 = 4294967296, plus 0.2 * 1073741824 = 214748364.8, so total = 4294967296 + 214748364.8 = 4509715660.8, but wait, let's recalc precisely: 4.2 * 1073741824 = 4.2 * 1073741824 = 451,388,4800? Let's recalc: 1073741824 * 4 = 4294967296, 1073741824 * 0.2 = 214748364.8, so sum = 4294967296 + 214748364.8 = 4509715660.8. But the example output total sum is 7264621772.8. Let's sum: 1.5G (1610612736) + 2K (2048) + 3M (3145728) + 4.2G (4509715660.8) = 1610612736 + 2048 = 1610614784, plus 3145728 = 1613760512, plus 4509715660.8 = 6123476172.8? That doesn't match. Let's recalc carefully:

Wait, the example input is:
"1.5G, 2K,
3M, and 4.2G
500,000K and 600M"

So there are 6 numbers:
1. 1.5G
2. 2K
3. 3M
4. 4.2G
5. 500,000K
6. 600M

Let's compute each:
1. 1.5G = 1.5 * 1024^3 = 1.5 * 1073741824 = 1610612736 bytes.
2. 2K = 2 * 1024 = 2048 bytes.
3. 3M = 3 * 1024^2 = 3 * 1048576 = 3145728 bytes.
4. 4.2G = 4.2 * 1073741824 = 4513884800? Let's recalc: 4.2 * 1073741824 = 4.2 * 1073741824 = 4513884800? Let's do multiplication: 1073741824 * 4 = 4294967296, plus 0.2 * 1073741824 = 214748364.8, so total = 4294967296 + 214748364.8 = 4509715660.8. So 4.2G = 4509715660.8 bytes.
5. 500,000K = 500000 * 1024 = 512000000 bytes? Let's compute: 500000 * 1024 = 512000000 bytes.
6. 600M = 600 * 1048576 = 629145600 bytes.

Now sum them:
Sum = 1610612736 + 2048 = 1610614784
+ 3145728 = 1613760512
+ 4509715660.8 = 6123476172.8
+ 512000000 = 6635476172.8
+ 629145600 = 7264621772.8

Yes, that matches the example output total sum: 7264621772.8 bytes.

Then the output lines:
First line: total sum in bytes: 7264621772.8
Second line: sum in kilobytes: total sum / 1024 = 7264621772.8 / 1024 = 7094357.2 (because 7094357.2 * 1024 = 7264621772.8? Let's check: 7094357.2 * 1024 = 7094357.2 * 1024 = 7264621772.8 exactly, yes.)
Third line: sum in megabytes: total sum / (1024^2) = 7264621772.8 / 1048576 = 6928.1 (because 6928.1 * 1048576 = 7264621772.8, yes.)
Fourth line: sum in gigabytes: total sum / (1024^3) = 7264621772.8 / 1073741824 = 6.8 (because 6.8 * 1073741824 = 730, etc. Let's check: 6.8 * 1073741824 = 730, etc. Actually 6.8 * 1073741824 = 730, etc. Let's compute: 6 * 1073741824 = 6442450944, plus 0.8 * 1073741824 = 858993459.2, sum = 730, etc. Actually 6442450944 + 858993459.2 = 730, etc. Let's compute exactly: 6442450944 + 858993459.2 = 730, etc. Let's do: 6442450944 + 858993459.2 = 730, etc. Actually, let's compute: 6442450944 + 858993459.2 = 730, etc. I'll recalc: 1073741824 * 6.8 = 1073741824 * 6 = 6442450944, plus 1073741824 * 0.8 = 858993459.2, sum = 730, etc. Wait, let's compute: 6442450944 + 858993459.2 = 730, etc. Actually, 6442450944 + 858993459.2 = 730, etc. Let's compute precisely: 6442450944 + 858993459.2 = 730, etc. I'll do: 6442450944 + 858993459.2 = 730, etc. Let me compute: 6442450944 + 858993459.2 = 730, etc. Actually, let me compute: 6442450944 + 858993459.2 = 730, etc. I'll do: 6442450944 + 858993459.2 = 730, etc. I'll trust the given output: 6.8 G.

So the conversion factors are:
- If suffix is k or K: multiply by 1024.
- If suffix is m or M: multiply by 1024^2.
- If suffix is g or G: multiply by 1024^3.
- If no suffix, then it's just the number itself (or maybe treat as bytes? But the problem statement says "optional suffixes", so maybe if no suffix, then it's just the number itself, i.e., bytes).

But the problem statement says "extracts all numbers followed by optional suffixes", so maybe the number might not have a suffix. But then the conversion factor for no suffix is 1. But the problem statement says "converts them to their base value (kilo=1024, M=1024*1024, etc.)". The phrase "base value" might be ambiguous. But I'll assume that if there's no suffix, then it's just the number itself (i.e., bytes). But then the output is printed as total sum in bytes, then in kilobytes, megabytes, gigabytes. But the problem statement says "prints the total sum as well as the sum in kilobytes (K), megabytes (M), and gigabytes (G) to one decimal place." So the first line is the sum in bytes, second line is sum in kilobytes, third line is sum in megabytes, fourth line is sum in gigabytes.

We need to extract numbers from the input string. The input string can contain multiple lines. We need to use regex to match numbers with optional suffixes. The numbers can have commas as thousand separators. So the regex should allow optional commas in the integer part. But careful: The number might be like "500,000K". We need to remove commas before parsing. But we can use regex that matches digits with optional commas. But then we need to remove commas from the matched string. But also the number might be a decimal number, e.g., "1.5G". So the regex should allow optional decimal point and digits after decimal point. But also the number might be like "3M" with no decimal point. But also the number might be like "2K" with no decimal point. But also the number might be like "600M" with no decimal point. But also the number might be like "500,000K" with commas. So the regex pattern: We want to match something like: optional sign? But probably not negative numbers. The problem doesn't mention negative numbers. So we assume positive numbers. So pattern: ([0-9,]+(\.[0-9]+)?)([kKmMgG])? But careful: The suffix is optional. But also the number might not have a suffix. But then the conversion factor is 1. But the problem statement says "optional suffixes", so yes.

But also the input might have extra spaces, punctuation, etc. So we can use a regex that finds all occurrences of a pattern that is: one or more digits, possibly with commas, optionally followed by a decimal point and one or more digits, then optionally followed by one of the suffix letters k, K, m, M, g, G. But careful: The suffix letter should be captured as a separate group. But also the number might be like "1.5G" where the suffix is attached to the number. But also the number might be like "500,000K" where the suffix is attached. But also the number might be like "600M" where the suffix is attached.

We can use a regex like: "([0-9,]+(?:\\.[0-9]+)?)([kKmMgG])?" But careful: The suffix group is optional. But then we need to check if the suffix is present. But then we need to remove commas from the numeric part. But also the number might be like "1.5G" where the decimal point is present. But then we can use Double.parseDouble after removing commas.

But careful: The input might have multiple lines. So we can read the entire input from standard input using something like: use a Scanner reading System.in, then use scanner.useDelimiter("\\A") to read the entire input as one string, or use BufferedReader to read lines and then join them. But the problem says "reads a string from standard input (can contain multiple lines)". So we can use something like: 
BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
String line;
while((line = br.readLine()) != null) { sb.append(line).append("\n"); }
Then input = sb.toString();

Then use Pattern and Matcher to find all matches.

We need to sum the values in bytes. So we'll have a double totalBytes = 0. For each match, parse the numeric part (remove commas), then parse as double. Then check if there's a suffix. If suffix is present, then multiply by appropriate factor:
- if suffix is 'k' or 'K': multiply by 1024.
- if suffix is 'm' or 'M': multiply by 1024^2.
- if suffix is 'g' or 'G': multiply by 1024^3.
- if no suffix, then factor is 1.

But wait, the problem statement says "converts them to their base value (kilo=1024, M=1024*1024, etc.)". It might be that if there's no suffix, then it's already in bytes. But maybe the intended behavior is that if there's no suffix, then it's just the number itself. But the problem statement says "optional suffixes", so yes.

After summing, we need to print:
Line 1: total sum in bytes with one decimal place.
Line 2: total sum in kilobytes (i.e., total sum / 1024) with one decimal place, appended with " k".
Line 3: total sum in megabytes (i.e., total sum / (1024^2)) with one decimal place, appended with " M".
Line 4: total sum in gigabytes (i.e., total sum / (1024^3)) with one decimal place, appended with " G".

But wait, check the example: The first line is "7264621772.8" (bytes). The second line is "7094357.2 k". The third line is "6928.1 M". The fourth line is "6.8 G". So yes.

We need to format the output with one decimal place. We can use System.out.printf with format specifiers.

Edge cases: If no numbers are found, then total sum is 0. But then output lines would be "0.0", "0.0 k", "0.0 M", "0.0 G". But the problem doesn't specify what to do if no numbers are found. But we can assume that input always has at least one number.

We need to use only java.* packages. So we can only import java.util, java.io, java.text maybe, but not java.util.regex? But java.util.regex is in the java.* namespace? Actually, java.util.regex is not in java.* because it's in java.util. Wait, the problem says "can only import packages in the java.* namespace". That means we can only import packages that start with "java." but not "javax." or others. But java.util.regex is in the java.util package, which is not allowed because it's not in java.*? Wait, check: "java.*" means packages that start with "java." So java.util.regex is allowed because it's in java.util, but wait, the problem says "can only import packages in the java.* namespace". That means we can import java.util.regex because it's in java.util, but wait, "java.util" is not "java.*"? Actually, "java.util" is a subpackage of java, but the problem says "can only import packages in the java.* namespace". That means we can import java.util.regex because it's in java.util, but wait, "java.util" is not "java.*"? Actually, "java.util" is a subpackage of java, but the problem says "can only import packages in the java.* namespace", which means packages that start with "java." So java.util.regex qualifies because it starts with "java."? Actually, "java.util.regex" starts with "java.util", which is not "java."? Wait, the problem says "can only import packages in the java.* namespace". That means we can only import packages that are in the java.* namespace, i.e., packages that start with "java." So java.util.regex is allowed because it starts with "java."? Actually, "java.util.regex" does not start with "java."? It starts with "java.util.regex", but the rule "java.*" means any package that starts with "java." So "java.util.regex" does start with "java." because "java.util.regex" starts with "java."? Let's check: "java.util.regex" - the prefix is "java.", so it's allowed. So we can import java.util.regex.

We can also import java.io and java.util. But we are not allowed to import any other packages. But we can use java.util.Scanner, java.util.regex.Pattern, java.util.regex.Matcher, java.io.BufferedReader, java.io.InputStreamReader, etc.

We need to produce a complete single-file program. So we need a public class, e.g., "Main", with a main method.

I'll produce a class named "Main" with a main method.

Plan:
- Use BufferedReader to read entire input.
- Build a string that contains the entire input.
- Use Pattern and Matcher to find matches.
- For each match, get group(1) as the numeric part, group(2) as the suffix (if any).
- Remove commas from the numeric part.
- Parse the numeric part as a double.
- Determine multiplier based on suffix:
  if suffix is null, multiplier = 1.
  if suffix equals "k" or "K", multiplier = 1024.
  if suffix equals "m" or "M", multiplier = 1024 * 1024.
  if suffix equals "g" or "G", multiplier = 1024 * 1024 * 1024.
- Add the value (number * multiplier) to total sum.
- After processing all matches, compute kilobytes = total sum / 1024, megabytes = total sum / (1024^2), gigabytes = total sum / (1024^3).
- Print the results with one decimal place. Use System.out.printf with format specifiers.

Corner: The input might have multiple lines, so we need to join them. But careful: The input might have newline characters. But that's fine.

Regex: We want to match numbers that might have commas. The pattern: "([0-9,]+(?:\\.[0-9]+)?)([kKmMgG])?" But careful: The suffix group is optional. But then if the suffix is present, it must be immediately after the number. But what if there is whitespace between? The problem says "extracts all numbers followed by optional suffixes", so the suffix should be immediately attached to the number? But the example "500,000K" has no space between the number and the suffix. But what if there is a space? The problem statement says "followed by optional suffixes", so I assume the suffix is immediately after the number with no intervening non-digit characters. But the input might have punctuation. But we can assume that the number and suffix are contiguous. But what if there is a comma after the suffix? Possibly not.

I can use regex: "([0-9,]+(?:\\.[0-9]+)?)([kKmMgG])?" This should match. But careful: The group for suffix is optional. But then if the suffix is not present, group(2) will be null. But then we need to check if group(2) is not null.

I need to compile the pattern with Pattern.compile. Then use matcher.find() in a loop.

Edge: The input might have multiple matches. We sum them.

After summing, we print the results.

I need to format the output with one decimal place. Use System.out.printf with "%.1f\n" etc.

I need to produce a complete program.

I'll produce a class named "Main" with a main method.

I'll produce code:

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        // Read entire input from standard input
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line;
        while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
            sb.append(line).append("\n");
        }
        String input = sb.toString();

        // Define regex pattern to match numbers with optional suffix
        // Pattern explanation:
        // ([0-9,]+(?:\\.[0-9]+)?) matches the numeric part (with optional commas and optional decimal fraction)
        // ([kKmMgG])? optionally matches one of the suffix letters
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("([0-9,]+(?:\\.[0-9]+)?)([kKmMgG])?");
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(input);

        double totalBytes = 0.0;
        while (matcher.find()) {
            String numberPart = matcher.group(1);
            // Remove commas
            String cleanNumber = numberPart.replace(",", "");
            double value = Double.parseDouble(cleanNumber);
            String suffix = matcher.group(2);
            double multiplier = 1.0;
            if (suffix != null) {
                switch (suffix.charAt(0)) {
                    case 'k':
                    case 'K':
                        multiplier = 1024.0;
                        break;
                    case 'm':
                    case 'M':
                        multiplier = 1024.0 * 1024.0;
                        break;
                    case 'g':
                    case 'G':
                        multiplier = 1024.0 * 1024.0 * 1024.0;
                        break;
                    default:
                        // Should not happen
                        break;
                }
            }
            totalBytes += value * multiplier;
        }

        double kilobytes = totalBytes / 1024.0;
        double megabytes = totalBytes / (1024.0 * 1024.0);
        double gigabytes = totalBytes / (1024.0 * 1024.0 * 1024.0);

        // Print results with one decimal place
        System.out.printf("%.1f%n", totalBytes);
        System.out.printf("%.1f %c%n", kilobytes, 'k');
        System.out.printf("%.1f %c%n", megabytes, 'M');
        System.out.printf("%.1f %c%n", gigabytes, 'G');
    }
}

But wait, check the output formatting: The example output lines are:
7264621772.8
7094357.2 k
6928.1 M
6.8 G

So the first line is just the number with one decimal place, no unit. The second line is the kilobyte value with one decimal place followed by a space and then "k". The third line is the megabyte value with one decimal place followed by a space and then "M". The fourth line is the gigabyte value with one decimal place followed by a space and then "G".

I need to check: The problem statement says "prints the total sum as well as the sum in kilobytes (K), megabytes (M), and gigabytes (G) to one decimal place." But the example output uses lowercase "k" for kilobytes, uppercase "M" for megabytes, and uppercase "G" for gigabytes. But the problem statement says "k, M, G" but the example output: second line "7094357.2 k", third line "6928.1 M", fourth line "6.8 G". So the kilobyte unit is lowercase "k", megabyte unit is uppercase "M", gigabyte unit is uppercase "G". But the problem statement said "k, K, m, M, g, G" but then said "kilo=1024, M=1024*1024, etc." So maybe the intended conversion is: if suffix is k or K, then it's kilobytes, but then when printing the sum in kilobytes, we use lowercase "k". But then if suffix is m or M, then it's megabytes, but then when printing the sum in megabytes, we use uppercase "M". And if suffix is g or G, then it's gigabytes, but then when printing the sum in gigabytes, we use uppercase "G". But then what about if there's no suffix? Then it's bytes, and we don't print a unit. So that's consistent with the example.

I need to check: The program should sum all numbers (converted to bytes) and then print the total sum in bytes, then in kilobytes, then in megabytes, then in gigabytes. So that's correct.

I need to check: The regex: "([0-9,]+(?:\\.[0-9]+)?)([kKmMgG])?" might match numbers that are not intended. But what if the number is like "1,000" with a comma? It will match "1,000" and then group(1) is "1,000", group(2) is null. That is fine.

I need to check: The regex might also match numbers that are part of a larger number if there are multiple numbers in a line. But that's fine.

I need to check: The regex might match numbers with a trailing suffix letter that is attached to the number. But what if there is a punctuation immediately after the number? The regex as written will not match if there's a space between the number and the suffix. But the problem statement says "followed by optional suffixes", so I assume the suffix is immediately attached to the number with no intervening non-digit characters. But what if there is a space? The problem statement says "extracts all numbers followed by optional suffixes", so maybe the suffix is always attached. But the example input "3M, and 4.2G" has no space between "3M" and the comma. But "and" is a word. So it's fine.

I need to check: The regex might also match numbers that are part of a larger word if not careful. But it's anchored to digits and optional decimal. It should be fine.

I need to check: The regex might match numbers with a trailing suffix letter that is attached to the number. But what if the number is like "500,000K" then group(1) is "500,000" and group(2) is "K". That works.

I need to check: The regex might match numbers with a decimal point. That works.

I need to check: The regex might match numbers with a comma in the integer part. That works.

I need to check: The regex might match numbers with a comma in the fractional part? But the pattern "([0-9,]+)" will match digits and commas, but if there is a comma in the fractional part, it might be problematic. But the problem statement says "handles numbers with commas as thousand separators", so the commas should only appear in the integer part, not in the fractional part. But what if the input is "1,000.50K"? That might be ambiguous because the comma is in the integer part. But our regex "([0-9,]+)" will match "1,000.50" if there's no separation between the comma and the decimal point? Actually, our regex is "([0-9,]+(?:\\.[0-9]+)?)". This means: one or more digits or commas, then optionally a group that is a literal dot followed by one or more digits. But if the input is "1,000.50K", then group(1) will be "1,000.50" because the comma is included in the [0-9,]+ part. But then the decimal part is ".50". But then the comma is not removed because it's in the integer part. But then when we call replace(",", ""), it will remove the comma, resulting in "1000.50". That is correct.

But what if the input is "1.000,50K" with a comma as the decimal separator? The problem statement says "handles numbers with commas as thousand separators", so it's likely that the comma is only used as a thousand separator, not as a decimal separator. So we assume that the decimal separator is always a period. So that's fine.

I need to check: The regex might match numbers that are not intended if there is a comma in the fractional part. But I'll assume input is well-formed.

I need to check: The program should be production-ready. So I need to handle exceptions maybe. But the problem doesn't require exception handling. But I can let exceptions propagate.

I need to check: The program should be a single file. So I'll produce a single file with a public class named "Main".
