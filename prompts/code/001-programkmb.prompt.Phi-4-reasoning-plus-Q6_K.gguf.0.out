We are asked: "Task: write a complete single-file Java program using only the standard library (can only import packages in the java.* namespace). The spec for the program is as follows: This program reads a string from standard input, extracts all numbers followed by optional suffixes (k, K, m, M, g, G), converts them to their base value (kilo=1024, M=1024*1024, etc.), calculates their sum, and prints the total sum as well as the sum in kilobytes (K), megabytes (M), and gigabytes (G). The program handles numbers with commas as thousand separators and supports both lowercase and uppercase suffixes.

Example input:
```
1.5G, 2K, 3M, and 4.2G
500,000K and 600M
```
Example output:
```
7264621772.8
7094357.0 K
6928.0 M
6.0 G
```

We need to produce a complete single-file Java program that uses only standard library (java.* packages). We need to read from standard input. The program should extract all numbers with optional suffixes. The suffixes are: k, K, m, M, g, G. The conversion factors: kilo = 1024, M = 1024*1024, G = 1024*1024*1024. The program should sum them up in base units (bytes). Then print the total sum as a decimal number with one decimal place? The sample output: "7264621772.8" is printed with one decimal place. Then print the sum in kilobytes (K), megabytes (M), and gigabytes (G). The sample output: "7094357.0 K", "6928.0 M", "6.0 G". Let's check: The input: "1.5G, 2K, 3M, and 4.2G" and "500,000K and 600M". Let's compute: 1.5G = 1.5 * 1024^3 = 1.5 * 1073741824 = 1610612736.0 bytes, 4.2G = 4.2 * 1073741824 = 4513886784.8? Wait, let's recalc: 4.2 * 1073741824 = 451,388,678.4? Let's recalc: 1073741824 * 4.2 = 1073741824 * 4 = 4294967296, plus 0.2 * 1073741824 = 214748364.8, so total = 4294967296 + 214748364.8 = 450,971,0660.8? Wait, let's recalc carefully: 1.5 * 1073741824 = 1610612736.0, 4.2 * 1073741824 = 4513886784.8, 2K = 2 * 1024 = 2048, 3M = 3 * 1024^2 = 3 * 1048576 = 3145728, 500,000K = 500000 * 1024 = 512000000, 600M = 600 * 1048576 = 629145600. Sum = 1610612736.0 + 4513886784.8 + 2048 + 3145728 + 512000000 + 629145600 = Let's sum: 1610612736.0 + 4513886784.8 = 6124499520.8, then add 2048 gives 6124501568.8, then add 3145728 gives 6127647296.8, then add 512000000 gives 6637647296.8, then add 629145600 gives 7266792896.8. But sample output is 7264621772.8. Let's recalc carefully: Possibly the sample input is "1.5G, 2K, 3M, and 4.2G" and "500,000K and 600M". Let's recalc each:
1.5G = 1.5 * 1024^3 = 1.5 * 1073741824 = 1610612736.0
4.2G = 4.2 * 1073741824 = 4513886784.8
2K = 2 * 1024 = 2048
3M = 3 * 1024^2 = 3 * 1048576 = 3145728
500,000K = 500000 * 1024 = 512000000
600M = 600 * 1048576 = 629145600

Now sum: 1610612736.0 + 4513886784.8 = 6124499520.8, then add 2048 = 6124501568.8, then add 3145728 = 6127647296.8, then add 512000000 = 6637647296.8, then add 629145600 = 7266792896.8. But sample output is 7264621772.8, which is 217117.0 less. Let's check: maybe the conversion for M is 1024*1024? That is 1048576. For G, it's 1024*1024*1024 = 1073741824. For K, it's 1024. So our conversion is correct. Let's check the sample input: "1.5G, 2K, 3M, and 4.2G" and "500,000K and 600M". Possibly the sample input is two lines. But the sample output: "7264621772.8" is the sum in bytes. Let's recalc: maybe the sample input is "1.5G, 2K, 3M, and 4.2G" on one line and "500,000K and 600M" on the next line. But our sum is 7266792896.8. The difference is 217117.0. Let's check if maybe the comma in "500,000K" should be interpreted as a thousand separator, so "500,000" becomes 500000, which is what we did. Alternatively, maybe the sample input is "1.5G, 2K, 3M, and 4.2G" and "500,000K and 600M" but the sample output is different. Let's recalc each carefully with high precision arithmetic:
1.5 * 1073741824 = 1610612736.0 exactly.
4.2 * 1073741824 = 4513886784.8 exactly.
2 * 1024 = 2048 exactly.
3 * 1048576 = 3145728 exactly.
500000 * 1024 = 512000000 exactly.
600 * 1048576 = 629145600 exactly.
Sum = 1610612736.0 + 4513886784.8 = 6124499520.8, plus 2048 = 6124501568.8, plus 3145728 = 6127647296.8, plus 512000000 = 6637647296.8, plus 629145600 = 7266792896.8.
So our sum is 7266792896.8, not 7264621772.8. The difference is 217117.0. Let's check if maybe the conversion for M is 1000*1000 instead of 1024*1024? But the spec says kilo=1024, M=1024*1024, etc. But maybe the sample output is using decimal conversion (1K=1000, 1M=1000000, 1G=1000000000) instead of binary conversion? Let's check: if we use decimal conversion: 1.5G = 1.5 * 1000000000 = 1500000000, 4.2G = 4200000000, 2K = 2000, 3M = 3000000, 500,000K = 500000000, 600
