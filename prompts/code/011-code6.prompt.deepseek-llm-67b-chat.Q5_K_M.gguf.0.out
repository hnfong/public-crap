Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

No, there are no inputs that will lead to the output "Done" because the program uses the mathematical infinity (math.inf) as a stopping condition in the while loop. The program will keep incrementing x indefinitely, and the loop will never end. Therefore, the print statement "Done" will never be executed.
