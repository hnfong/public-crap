To solve this problem, we need to convert a given integer into a compact, human-readable string representation. The goal is to represent the number with a couple of significant digits and indicate the order of magnitude (like k for thousand, M for million, etc.), while keeping the output string as short as possible, ideally under 4 characters.

### Approach
1. **Understand the Requirements**: The function should take an integer and return a string. The output should be compact, using suffixes like 'k', 'M', etc., for large numbers. The output should have at most 4 characters if possible.
2. **Identify the Orders of Magnitude**: We need to handle different scales: thousands (k), millions (M), billions (B), etc. Each order of magnitude is 1000 times the previous.
3. **Determine the Suffix**: For a given number, we determine the appropriate suffix by checking how many groups of 1000 the number can be divided into. For example:
   - Numbers less than 1000 are returned as is.
   - Numbers between 1000 and 999,999 are represented in thousands with suffix 'k'.
   - Numbers between 1,000,000 and 999,999,999 are represented in millions with suffix 'M'.
   - Similarly for billions (B) and beyond.
4. **Format the Number**: For numbers that require a suffix, we convert the number to the corresponding higher unit (e.g., divide by 1000 for thousands). We then format this value to have one decimal place if necessary, but we must ensure the total string length is within 4 characters. For instance:
   - 800 becomes 0.8k (which is 4 characters) but note that 0.8k is acceptable.
   - However, if the number is exactly 1000, it becomes 1k (2 characters).
5. **Significant Digits**: We need to show one or two digits before the decimal and one digit after if needed, but always aiming for brevity. For example, 9385832 becomes 9.4M (3 characters).
6. **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases such as zero, negative numbers, very large numbers (beyond trillions), and numbers that round up to the next unit (e.g., 999999 might become 1000k, but we should represent it as 1M).

### Solution Code
```python
def compact_number(n):
    if n == 0:
        return "0"
    
    abs_n = abs(n)
    sign = '-' if n < 0 else ''
    
    if abs_n < 1000:
        return sign + str(abs_n)
    
    units = ['', 'k', 'M', 'B', 'T', 'P', 'E', 'Z', 'Y']
    unit_index = 0
    num = float(abs_n)
    
    while num >= 1000 and unit_index < len(units) - 1:
        num /= 1000.0
        unit_index += 1
        
    # Format the number to have at most 3 digits total (including the decimal part) to aim for 4 characters including the sign and unit?
    # But note: the requirement is less than 4 characters if possible. So we need to check the length.
    
    # If the number is an integer in the new unit, we can output without decimal.
    if num.is_integer():
        formatted_num = str(int(num))
    else:
        # We want to have one decimal digit, but if that makes the string too long, we might need to adjust?
        formatted_num = f"{num:.1f}"
        # Sometimes rounding might cause .0, so check again.
        if formatted_num.endswith('.0'):
            formatted_num = formatted_num[:-2]
    
    # Now, the string is sign + formatted_num + units[unit_index]
    result = sign + formatted_num + units[unit_index]
    
    # Check if the length is more than 4? Then we might need to truncate further.
    # But note: the requirement says "less than 4 characters if at all possible".
    # So if the result is more than 4, we might remove the decimal.
    if len(result) > 4:
        # Try without decimal
        if '.' in formatted_num:
            # Check if rounding up helps?
            integer_part = int(round(num))
            if integer_part >= 1000 and unit_index < len(units) - 1:
                integer_part /= 1000.0
                unit_index += 1
                # Format again without decimal if possible?
                if integer_part.is_integer():
                    new_formatted = str(int(integer_part))
                else:
                    new_formatted = f"{integer_part:.1f}"
                    if new_formatted.endswith('.0'):
                        new_formatted = new_formatted[:-2]
                result = sign + new_formatted + units[unit_index]
            else:
                # Otherwise, just take the integer part?
                integer_value = int(num)
                # But if integer_value is 1000, we need to promote?
                if integer_value >= 1000:
                    integer_value /= 1000
                    unit_index += 1
                    result = sign + str(int(integer_value)) + units[unit_index]
                else:
                    result = sign + str(integer_value) + units[unit_index]
        # If the result is still too long, we might have to use integer.
    # Special case: if the number is negative and the string is too long, we might need to adjust.
    
    # However, for the given examples, we don't expect too long, but for very large numbers we might.
    # Alternatively, we can ensure that the number part is at most 3 digits.
    # Let's ensure the total length is <=4 by possibly rounding to integer.
    if len(result) > 4:
        # Try to round to integer
        rounded = round(num)
        if rounded >= 1000 and unit_index < len(units)-1:
            rounded /= 1000
            unit_index += 1
        if rounded.is_integer():
            result = sign + str(int(rounded)) + units[unit_index]
        else:
            result = sign + str(rounded) + units[unit_index]
    
    return result
```

### Explanation
1. **Handling Zero and Negative Numbers**: The function first checks if the input is zero or negative. For negatives, it adds a minus sign to the result.
2. **Small Numbers**: Numbers less than 1000 are returned as strings without any suffix.
3. **Large Numbers**: For numbers 1000 and above, the function determines the appropriate unit (k, M, etc.) by repeatedly dividing by 1000 until the number is below 1000 or until it runs out of units.
4. **Formatting**: The number is formatted to have one decimal digit if it isn't an integer. If the formatted string with the unit exceeds 4 characters, it attempts to round the number to an integer and adjust the unit if necessary to stay within the length constraint.
5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles cases where rounding might push the number to the next unit (e.g., 999999 becomes 1000k, which is then converted to 1M).

This approach ensures that the output is as compact as possible while remaining human-readable, adhering to the constraint of keeping the string length under 4 characters where feasible. [end of text]
