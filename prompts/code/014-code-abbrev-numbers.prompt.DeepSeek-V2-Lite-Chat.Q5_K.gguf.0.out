User: Here's a coding task. Please read the requirements carefully as it may contain some nuance.

You are required to write a function that takes in an integer. The output should be a string that roughly represents the number in compact, human readable form. for example, input/output pairs may be:

- 2 => 2
- 800 => 0.8k
- 9385832 => 9.4M

The idea is to represent the number with a couple significant digits and give the order of magnitude. The output string should be less than 4 characters if at all possible.

You may use any popular and reasonable programming language. Make sure to handle all edge cases you can think of.
