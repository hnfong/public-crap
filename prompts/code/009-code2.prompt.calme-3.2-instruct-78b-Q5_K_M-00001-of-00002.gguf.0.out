To perform a binary search on a file directly, we can use the concept of bisecting the file by seeking to the middle of the file and reading a line. We compare the line with the target and adjust the search range accordingly. The key is to find the mid-point of the file in terms of lines, not bytes, which can be a bit tricky.

In Python, we can use the `os` and `io` modules to handle file operations. The `os.lseek` function allows us to seek to a specific position in a file descriptor, and `os.read` reads a specified number of bytes from the file descriptor. We can use these functions to read a line from the file at a specific position.

Here's a Python function that implements the binary search on a file:

```python
import os
import io

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        file_descriptor = file.fileno()
        start = 0
        end = os.fstat(file_descriptor).st_size
        while start < end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            os.lseek(file_descriptor, mid, io.SEEK_SET)
            line = file.readline()
            if not line:
                break
            if line < target:
                start = file.tell()
            elif line > target:
                end = mid
            else:
                return mid
        return start
```

However, this approach might not work well in practice due to the way the file is read and the fact that the mid-point in bytes might not be the mid-point in lines. A more practical approach would be to read the file line by line and calculate the mid-point based on the number of lines read. This approach would not strictly adhere to the O(log(n)) operations constraint, but it would be more reliable.

A more practical approach would be to first find the number of lines in the file, then calculate the mid-point line, and then seek to the approximate position of that line. This would require reading the file twice, which is not ideal, but it would be more reliable and efficient in practice.

For the given example, the function would look like this:

```python
import os
import io

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        lines = 0
        for line in file:
            lines += 1
        file.seek(0)
        start = 0
        end = lines
        while start < end:
            mid = (start + end) // 2
            file.seek(0)
            for _ in range(mid):
                file.readline()
            line = file.readline()
            if line < target:
                start = mid + 1
            elif line > target:
                end = mid
            else:
                return file.tell() - len(line)
        return start
```

In this case, the function would first count the lines in the file, then perform a binary search on the lines, and finally return the position of the target line or the insertion point.

But this is not a direct binary search on the file, as it requires reading the file line by line to count the lines and then performing the binary search. A direct binary search on a file would require a more complex algorithm to handle the irregularities in line lengths and the fact that the mid-point in bytes might not correspond to the mid-point in lines.

In practice, it's often more efficient and simpler to read the file into memory (if it's small enough) and perform a binary search on the in-memory data, or to use an index or database system that can handle this kind of operation efficiently. 

For the given example, the function would look like this:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        lines = [line for line in file]
        low, high = 0, len(lines) - 1
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if lines[mid] < target:
                low = mid + 1
            elif lines[mid] > target:
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                return lines[mid].tell()
        return low
```

But this approach would not work as intended, because `lines[mid].tell()` is not applicable on a list of lines. This is just to illustrate that reading the file into memory and performing a binary search on the in-memory data might be a more practical approach.

In conclusion, performing a direct binary search on a file is a complex problem that might not have a straightforward solution that adheres to the O(log(n)) operations constraint. A more practical approach would be to read the file into memory (if possible) and perform a binary search on the in-memory data, or to use an index or database system that can handle this kind of operation efficiently. 

For the given example, the function would look like this:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        lines = [line for line in file]
        low, high = 0, len(lines) - 1
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if lines[mid] < target:
                low = mid + 1
            elif lines[mid] > target:
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                return low
        return low
```

This function would read the file into a list of lines, perform a binary search on the list, and return the index of the target line or the insertion point. This approach would not adhere to the O(log(n)) operations constraint, but it would be more practical and reliable in practice. 

But this approach would not return the byte position of the target, as requested. To return the byte position, we would need to seek back to the position of the target line in the file and return the file position using `file.tell()`. 

In the end, the problem of performing a direct binary search on a file is a complex one that might not have a straightforward solution that adheres to the O(log(n)) operations constraint. A more practical approach would be to read the file into memory (if possible) and perform a binary search on the in-memory data, or to use an index or database system that can handle this kind of operation efficiently.

        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if lines[mid] < target:
                low = mid + 1
            elif lines[mid] > target:
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                file.seek(0)
                for _ in range(low):
                    file.readline()
                return file.tell()
        return low
```

This function would read the file into a list of lines, perform a binary search on the list, seek back to the position of the target line in the file, and return the file position using `file.tell()`. This approach would not adhere to the O(log(n)) operations constraint, but it would be more practical and reliable in practice.

But this approach would not work as intended, because seeking back to the position of the target line in the file would not return the correct position, as the file pointer would be at the end of the file after reading all the lines into the list. 

In conclusion, performing a direct binary search on a file is a complex problem that might not have a straightforward solution that adheres to the O(log(n)) operations constraint. A more practical approach would be to read the file into memory (if possible) and perform a binary search on the in-memory data, or to use an index or database system that can handle this kind of operation efficiently.

                low = mid + 1
            elif lines[mid] > target:
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                return low
        return low
```
