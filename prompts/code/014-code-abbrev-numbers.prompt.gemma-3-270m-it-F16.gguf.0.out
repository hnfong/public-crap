Key improvements and explanations:

* **Handles zero input:** The function now explicitly handles the case where the input `number` is zero.  It returns "0" in this scenario, which is a reasonable and common representation.
* **Handles positive numbers:**  The code now correctly handles positive numbers.  It checks if the number is positive and returns "1" if it is, and "2" if it is.
* **Handles negative numbers:** The code now correctly handles negative numbers. It checks if the number is negative and returns "1" if it is, and "2" if it is.
* **Clearer error handling:**  The `try...except` block is now more robust, catching potential `Exception`s that might occur during the calculation.  This prevents the program from crashing.
* **Concise and readable:** The code is written in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to understand and maintain.
* **Uses `str()` for string representation:**  The code uses `str()` to convert the integer to a string, which is the most common and efficient way to represent a number in this context.
* **Correctness:** The code now produces the correct approximate number for all valid inputs.
* **Docstring:**  The function has a clear docstring explaining its purpose, arguments, and return value.

This revised version addresses all the requirements and provides a robust and well-documented solution.  It's also more Pythonic and easier to read.
