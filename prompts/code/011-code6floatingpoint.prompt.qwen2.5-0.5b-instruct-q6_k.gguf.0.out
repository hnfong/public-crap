Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Remember to answer all the questions

Q1.

assistant
To determine the eventual output of the given Python program, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Initialization**: `x = 0.0`
2. **While loop**: `while x < math.inf`
3. **Increment**: `x += 1.0`
4. **Increment again**: `x += 1.001`
5. **Termination**: `print(x)`

Let's break down the loop:

- The loop starts with `x = 0.0`.
- The loop continues until `x` is less than `math.inf`.
- Inside the loop, `x` is incremented by `1.0`.
- Then, `x` is incremented by `1.001`.
- The loop continues until `x` is less than `math.inf`.

The loop will continue indefinitely because `x` is always less than `math.inf` (which is a very large number). Therefore, the loop will never terminate.

**Final output**: `Done`
