What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)

assistant
The eventual output of the given Python program is:

```
0.0
```

This is because the program is attempting to calculate the value of `x` using the mathematical constant `math.inf`, which is greater than `math.inf`. The program will keep asking for input until `x` reaches the value of `math.inf`, at which point it will stop asking for input and print the value of `x`. [end of text]
