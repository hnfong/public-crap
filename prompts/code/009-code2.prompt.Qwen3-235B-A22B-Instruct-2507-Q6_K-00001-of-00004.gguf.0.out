To perform a **binary search on a text file** containing **lexicographically sorted lines**, we want to find the **byte position** of a target line (or where it would be inserted), **without loading the entire file into memory**.

We assume:
- Each line is terminated by a newline (`\n`).
- Lines are sorted in lexicographical (dictionary) order by their full content (including leading characters like `"1 "` or `"2 "`).
- We are searching for a **prefix** of a line ‚Äî i.e., we want to find the first line that is **lexicographically >= target**, which matches the behavior of `bisect_left`.

We cannot do traditional array-based binary search because we don't have random access to lines ‚Äî but we **can** use **binary search over byte offsets** in the file, using file seeking and reading around the middle to locate line boundaries.

### ‚úÖ Key Ideas

1. **Binary search on byte range [0, file_size]**
2. At each step:
   - Seek to a midpoint byte offset.
   - Read forward to find the next complete line (to avoid splitting lines).
3. Compare the line with the target.
4. Adjust search range accordingly.
5. Always return the **byte offset where the target line starts**, or where it should be inserted.

We use:
- `file.seek(offset)` to jump in the file.
- Read chunks to find newline boundaries.
- Handle edge cases: beginning/end of file, empty lines, etc.

### üöÄ Algorithm Outline

- Use `bisect_left` logic over byte offsets.
- Find line boundaries using `\n`.
- Only compare the **start of the line** with the `target` (as bytes).
- Return the **byte offset** of the matching or insertion line.

### ‚úÖ Python Implementation

```python
import os

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    """
    Perform binary search on a text file with sorted lines.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the file.
        target: bytes, the target string to search for (prefix match as in bisect_left)
    
    Returns:
        int: The byte offset of the first line >= target.
    """
    if not isinstance(target, bytes):
        raise ValueError("Target must be bytes")

    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        # Get file size
        f.seek(0, os.SEEK_END)
        file_size = f.tell()

        left, right = 0, file_size

        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            f.seek(mid)

            # If mid is not at start of file, move to beginning of next line
            if mid != 0:
                # Read one byte to check if we're in the middle of a newline
                f.readline()  # This consumes up to the end of the current line

            # Now read the next full line (or until EOF)
            line = f.readline()

            # If we reached EOF, it means we're at a point where no line exists
            if not line:
                # Backtrack to find the last line
                right = mid
                continue

            # Compare line with target
            if line >= target:
                # The current line is >= target, so answer is at mid or to the left
                right = mid
            else:
                # Current line < target, so we need to go right
                left = mid + 1

        return left
```

### üîç Example

Given the file `myfile.txt`:

```
1 I go to school\n
2 by bus\n
foo bar\n
hello world\n
zoo zoo zoo\n
```

Byte layout:
```
Offset 0:  '1 I go to school\n'        ‚Üí 17 bytes
Offset 17: '2 by bus\n'                ‚Üí 9 bytes
Offset 26: 'foo bar\n'                 ‚Üí 8 bytes
...
```

So:
```python
binary_search_file("myfile.txt", b"2 by")
```
We expect it to return **17**, because the line `"2 by bus\n"` starts at offset 17 and is the first line ‚â• `"2 by"`.

Let‚Äôs verify how the algorithm works:
- It searches byte offsets.
- When it lands near offset 17, it reads the line starting there.
- Compares `b"2 by bus\n" >= b"2 by"` ‚Üí True.
- So it moves `right = mid`, eventually converging to 17.

‚úÖ Correct.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- This function returns the **byte offset where a matching or succeeding line starts**, not the line content.
- It assumes lines are sorted **as bytes**, not decoded strings. If file is UTF-8, this is fine as long as sorting was done byte-wise.
- It does **O(log n)** file seeks and reads, each read being small (a few lines at most), so total I/O is **O(log N)** operations (in terms of system calls), though data read is slightly more due to line buffering.

### ‚úÖ Test It

You can test with:

```python
# Create test file
with open("myfile.txt", "wb") as f:
    f.write(b"1 I go to school\n2 by bus\nfoo bar\nhello world\nzoo zoo zoo\n")

print(binary_search_file("myfile.txt", b"2 by"))  # Should print 17
```

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

This function efficiently performs **binary search on a sorted text file** using only **O(log N)** seeks and reads, returning the **byte position** where the target line is found or should be inserted ‚Äî just like `bisect_left`. [end of text]
