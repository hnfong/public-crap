What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The output of the python program is:
1.0
```

This code demonstrates how to use the `math` module to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. The function `gcd()` is a built-in function in Python that takes two arguments, and returns the greatest common divisor. The `while` loop iterates over all possible values of x, starting from 1 and then multiplying the value by 1.001 until the GCD is reached. The `print()` function is used to display the result of the calculation.
