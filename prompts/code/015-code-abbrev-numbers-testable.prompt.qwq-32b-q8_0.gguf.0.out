Okay, I need to write a Python function called abbrev_num that takes an integer and returns a string representing it in a compact, human-readable form. Let's see the examples again. Like 8180 becomes 8.2K, and 9385832 becomes 9.4M. The key points are to use a couple of significant digits and keep the output to 4 characters or less. 

Hmm, the first thing I should think about is the order of magnitude. So the units are K for thousands, M for millions, B for billions, maybe T for trillions? Wait, what's the upper limit here? The problem doesn't specify, but the examples go up to M. Let's see, maybe we can have a list of the suffixes along with their thresholds. Like, for each suffix, we divide the number by the corresponding value and then format it.

Let me think of the steps. The function should process the number as follows:

1. Determine the appropriate suffix based on the size of the number. For example:
   - If the number is less than 1,000, just return the number as a string.
   - 1,000 to 999,999 → K
   - 1,000,000 to 999,999,999 → M
   - 1,000,000,000 and up → B? Or maybe even higher like T? The examples don't go beyond M, but maybe the problem expects up to B. Let me check the examples again. The third example is 9.4M for 9,385,832 which is under a million? Wait, 9,385,832 is over a million. Wait, 1 million is 1,000,000. So 9 million would be 9,000,000. So the example given is 9,385,832 which is ~9.4 million. So the M is correct. So perhaps the suffixes are K, M, B, T, etc. But the problem says "roughly" and "couple of significant digits". 

2. Once the suffix is determined, we need to divide the number by the corresponding value (like 1000 for K) and then round it to an appropriate number of digits so that the total string length is <=4.

Wait, the output must be <=4 characters. Let's see examples:

- 8180 → 8.2K (4 characters)
- 74581 → 75K (3 characters)
- 9385832 → 9.4M (4 characters)

So the format depends on how many digits we can show. Let's think of possible cases:

For numbers under 1000: just the number as a string. So that's straightforward.

For numbers in the thousands (like 8180):

Divide by 1000 → 8.18. To get 8.2K, which is 4 characters. So here, we need one decimal place. But how do we decide when to have a decimal?

Wait, the key is to have the total length (number part + suffix) be at most 4. Let's see:

The suffix takes 1 character (like K, M, etc). So the numeric part must be 3 characters at most. For example, "9.4" is 3 characters plus the K gives 4. 

So the numeric part can be up to 3 characters. So possible formats could be:

- If the number divided by the suffix's base is less than 10, then we can have one decimal place. Like 8.2 (3 chars) plus K → 4.

Wait, let's think of different cases:

Case 1: The number is between 1,000 and 9,999. For example, 8180 → 8.2K (4 chars). So here, 8.2 is three characters. So the format is one digit before decimal, one after, plus the K. 

Another example: 9999 → 10K (since 9999/1000 is ~9.999, which rounds to 10. So "10K" is 3 characters. Wait, but 10K is 3 characters (digits plus suffix). So that's okay.

Wait, but how do we decide when to round to an integer or keep a decimal?

The idea is to have the numeric part plus the suffix be at most 4 characters. So the numeric part can be 1, 2, or 3 digits (including decimals). Let's think of possible scenarios:

Suppose the value after division is X. We need to represent X in such a way that when combined with the suffix, the total length is <=4.

Possible options:

- If X is >= 10, then we can only have an integer part. For example, 10K (3 chars) is okay. 100 would be 100 → but that's over 1000, so maybe 100K? Wait, no, 100K is 5 characters. Wait, no, 100K would be 5, which is over. Wait, perhaps when X is over 10, we need to round to the nearest 10? Like 100 becomes 100 → but that's 3 digits plus the suffix? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to find the appropriate suffix (like K, M, etc) and then format the number divided by that suffix's value to have up to two significant digits, but ensuring the total length is 4 or less.

Alternatively, here's a possible approach:

We can have a list of the suffixes along with their divisor. For example:

suffixes = [ (1000, 'K'), (1e6, 'M'), (1e9, 'B'), (1e12, 'T') ]

We can loop through these suffixes in order from largest to smallest (or the other way?), and find the first one where the number is >= that divisor. Wait, no, perhaps we need to start from the highest possible suffix and see if the number is big enough. Wait, perhaps the order should be from largest to smallest so that we pick the highest possible suffix. For example, if the number is 1e9, then it's in the billions, so we use 'B'.

Wait, let's think of the steps:

1. Determine which suffix to use. For example, if the number is 9,385,832, then it's over a million, so we use 'M' (divisor 1e6). 

2. Divide the number by the divisor to get the value. For 9,385,832 / 1e6 = 9.385832.

3. Now, we need to format this value so that when combined with the suffix, the total length is <=4.

The key is to format the value in such a way that the string representation (without the suffix) plus the suffix is 4 characters or less.

So for the value 9.385832, the formatted string would be "9.4" (3 characters) plus "M" → total 4.

Another example: 74581 → 74.581 → divided by 1000 gives 74.581 → but the suffix is K. So 74.581 → but we need to format it so that the total is 4 characters. "74.5" would be 4 characters (74.5K is 5, which is over). Wait, no, the suffix is K, so the numeric part plus the K must be <=4. So 74.5 would be 5 characters (74.5K is 5, which is over). So in that case, the example says the output should be "75K". So that's 3 characters (75 plus K is 3? Wait, 75 is two digits, plus K is 3 total. So that's okay. So how do we get there?

The original number is 74581. Divided by 1000 is 74.581. To get to 75K, we round to the nearest 1 (so 75), then the string is "75" + "K" → 3 characters. So that's acceptable.

So the approach here is to round the value to an appropriate number of digits so that the total length is okay.

Hmm, so the problem is to find the right number of digits to display so that the total length is <=4.

Let me think of possible cases for the value (after division by the divisor):

Case 1: value < 10 → can have one decimal place. For example, 8.2 → "8.2" (3 chars) plus suffix → total 4.

Case 2: value between 10 and 99 → can have zero decimal places. So "10" → 2 chars plus suffix → 3 total. 

Wait, 10K is 3 characters. That's okay. 

If the value is 99.9, then rounding to 100 would be 3 digits, but that would be 100K (5 characters). Wait, but 99.9 is less than 100. So perhaps when the value is between 10 and 99.9, we can just take the integer part, but that might lose precision. Alternatively, maybe we can have one decimal place only if it allows the total to stay under 4.

Wait, let's think of 99.9 → 99.9 would be 4 characters (99.9 + K → 5? No, the value is 99.9, so the string would be "99.9" which is 5 characters (including the decimal and digits). So that's too long. So in that case, we need to round to the nearest integer. So 99.9 becomes 100 → but then "100" plus K would be 5 characters. Which is over. So that's a problem. Wait, but maybe the value is 99.9, so the original number is 99,900. So 99.9K → but that's 5 characters. So that's over. So how do we handle that?

Hmm, perhaps in such cases, we need to round to the nearest 10, so that the number can be represented as two digits. Like 99.9 → 100 → but that's three digits. Hmm, maybe the approach is to always round to the nearest 10 when the value is over 10, so that the numeric part can be two digits. Wait, but that might not always be possible. Let me think of possible strategies.

Alternatively, here's a possible algorithm:

Once the suffix is determined, compute the value (number / divisor). Then, decide how to format it so that the total length is <=4.

The maximum allowed length for the numeric part is 3 (since the suffix is 1 character, 3+1=4).

So the numeric part can be up to 3 characters. So possible options:

- If the value is >= 100 → then the numeric part would be "100" (3 digits) plus the suffix → 4 characters. But 100 would be 100, but that's 3 digits. Wait, but 100 would be 100, but that's 3 digits. So "100" + "K" → 4 characters? Wait, "100K" is 5 characters. Oh right, so that's a problem. So if the value is 100, then the numeric part is 3 digits, plus the suffix gives 4? Wait, no, 100 is three digits, plus the suffix (like K) would be 4 characters total? Wait, 100K is 5 characters. So that's over. So that's a problem. So how do we handle numbers that when divided by the divisor are over 100?

Wait, perhaps the suffixes are only up to a certain point. For example, if the number is 100,000, then divided by 1000 gives 100 → which would need to be represented as "100K" (5 characters). Which is over the limit. So that's a problem. So perhaps the function can't handle numbers that when divided by the divisor are over 100? Or maybe the suffixes are chosen such that the value is under 1000? Wait, perhaps the suffixes are chosen so that the value is less than 1000. Let me think again.

Wait, the suffixes are K (10^3), M (10^6), B (10^9), T (10^12). So for example, if the number is 1,000,000,000 (1 billion), then divided by 1e9 gives 1 → "1B" (2 characters). That's okay. If the number is 1,234,567,890 → divided by 1e9 is 1.23456789 → which can be formatted as "1.2B" (4 characters). 

But if the number is 1,234,567,890,000 (1.23456789 trillion), then divided by 1e12 gives 1.23456789 → "1.2T" (4 characters). 

But what about a number like 999,999,999 (about 1 billion). Divided by 1e9 is 0.999999999 → so the suffix would be B, but the value is less than 1. So we would have "1.0B"? Wait, but that's 4 characters. Wait, 0.999999999 would round to 1.0, so "1.0B" is 5 characters. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, maybe in that case, the suffix is M instead of B? Because 999,999,999 is less than 1e9 (which is 1,000,000,000). So the suffix would be M (since it's 999,999,999 → divided by 1e6 is 999.999999 → so the suffix is M. Then the value is ~999.999999 → which would need to be formatted as "1K" (since 999.999999 is almost 1000, so rounded to 1000 → "1K"? Wait, but that's a different suffix. Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to choose the largest possible suffix such that the value is at least 1. So for 999,999,999, the largest suffix where the value is >=1 is M (since 999,999,999 / 1e6 is ~999.999999, which is over 1). So the suffix is M, and the value is ~999.999999. So how to format that? The value is 999.999999 → which is almost 1000. So rounding to the nearest 10 would give 1000 → but then the value would be 1000, which divided by 1e6 would be 1, so the suffix would be B? Wait, no, because 1000 * 1e6 is 1e9. So perhaps in this case, the suffix should be B, but the value is 0.999999999, which is less than 1. So that's a problem. 

Hmm, perhaps the way to handle this is to choose the suffix such that the value is between 1 and 1000. Wait, but that might not always be possible. Alternatively, the suffix is chosen as the first one where the number is >= that divisor. So for example, the suffixes are ordered from largest to smallest. Let me think of the steps again:

The steps for the function could be:

1. If the number is less than 1000, return it as a string.

2. Else, iterate through the suffixes in order from largest to smallest (like T, B, M, K) and find the first suffix where the number is >= the divisor for that suffix. 

Wait, no, perhaps the order should be from the smallest to largest? Wait, no, to find the largest possible suffix. For example, for 1e9, the largest suffix is B. So the order should be from largest to smallest. Let me think of the suffix list as:

suffixes = [ (1e12, 'T'), (1e9, 'B'), (1e6, 'M'), (1e3, 'K') ]

Then, for a given number, we check each suffix in order. The first one where the number >= divisor is the one we use. 

Once the divisor and suffix are chosen, compute the value = number / divisor.

Now, we need to format the value into a string such that the total length (value_str + suffix) is <=4.

So the problem is how to format the value into a string of length 3 or less (since adding the suffix gives 4).

Possible approaches for formatting:

- If the value is >= 100 → then we can only have the first digit plus a '0' and a '0'? Like 100 → "100" → but that's 3 digits, plus the suffix would be 4 characters. Wait, "100K" is 5 characters. So that's over. So that's a problem. 

Hmm, so perhaps when the value is >= 100, we need to round it to the nearest 100, and then represent it as "1K" (if the suffix is K, but that would be a different suffix). Wait, maybe in that case, the suffix should be the next higher one. 

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when the value is over 100, the current suffix is not the best. Let me think of an example. Suppose the number is 1,234,567 (1.234567 million). The divisor is 1e6, so the value is 1.234567. So formatted as "1.2M" (4 characters). That's okay. 

Another example: 999,999 → 0.999999 million → which would be "1.0M" (5 characters). Wait, that's over. So how to handle that? 

Wait, 999,999 divided by 1e6 is 0.999999, which is less than 1. So the suffix would not be M, but K. Because 999,999 is less than 1e6. So the divisor would be 1e3 (K), so the value is 999.999. So then, the value is 999.999 → which is almost 1000. So how to format that? 

The value is 999.999 → which is 999.999. To format into 3 characters (so that plus K is 4). 

Possible options:

- Round to the nearest 10 → 1000 → but that would be 1000, which divided by 1e3 is 1000 → but that would require the suffix to be K, so "1000" → but that's 4 digits plus K → 5 characters. Not allowed. 

Hmm, so perhaps in this case, the value is 999.999 → which is 999.999. To format into 3 characters, perhaps we can do "1K" (since 999.999 is almost 1000 → so rounded to 1000, but then the suffix would be K, so "1K" → 2 characters plus K → 3 total. Wait, but 1000 is exactly 1K. So the value is 999.999 → which is just under 1000. So rounding to the nearest 100 would give 1000 → but then the value is 1000, so the suffix would be K, and the formatted string would be "1K" (since 100.0 would be 100, but 1000/1000 is 1 → "1K"). 

Ah, that's a better approach. So in this case, the value is 999.999 → which is 999.999. So when divided by 1e3 (the K suffix), the value is 999.999. To format this into 3 characters, perhaps we can round to the nearest 10, so 1000 → but that would be 1000, so the value is 1000 → which would be "1K" (since 1000 / 1000 is 1 → "1K"). 

So the key is to round the value to an appropriate number of digits so that the string representation is within the 3-character limit for the numeric part.

So the algorithm for formatting the value is:

- Determine the maximum number of digits allowed for the numeric part (3 characters).

- The numeric part can be:

   a) If the value is >= 100 → then we can only have one digit (since 100 is three digits, but that would require the suffix to be the next higher one? Wait, no. Wait, if the value is 100, then the numeric part is "100" (3 digits) plus the suffix → total 4 characters. But "100K" is 5 characters. Wait, that's a problem. So perhaps when the value is >= 100, we need to round it to the nearest 100 and then use the next higher suffix. 

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of the steps again:

Once the suffix is chosen (like K, M, etc), the value is number / divisor. 

We need to format the value into a string such that the total length (value_str + suffix) is <=4.

So the value_str must be at most 3 characters long.

So possible options for formatting the value:

Case 1: value < 10 → can have one decimal place. For example, 8.2 → "8.2" (3 characters).

Case 2: 10 <= value < 100 → can have no decimal places. So "12" (2 characters) or "99" (2 characters).

Case 3: value >= 100 → must be rounded to the nearest 100, and then represented as "100" → but that's 3 characters. But then the total would be 4 (e.g., "100K" → 5 characters). Wait, that's a problem. So perhaps when the value is >= 100, we need to round it to the nearest 100 and then use the next higher suffix. 

Wait, for example, if the value is 100 (divided by 1e3 → so the suffix is K), then the value is 100 → which would be "100" → but that's 3 characters plus K → 4 total? Wait, "100K" is 5 characters. So that's over. So that's not allowed. 

Hmm, so perhaps when the value is >= 100, we need to use the next higher suffix. For example, if the current suffix is K (divisor 1e3), and the value is 100 → then the number is 100 * 1e3 = 1e5 → which is 100,000. But 1e5 is 100,000 → which is 100 thousand. But 100,000 can be represented as 0.1 million (since 1e6 is a million). So the suffix would be M, and the value is 0.1 → which would be "0.1M" (4 characters). 

Ah, that's better. So the key is to choose the highest possible suffix so that the value is less than 1000. Because if the value is 1000, then it would be 1000 * divisor, which would be the next higher suffix. 

Wait, so the suffix selection must be such that the value is less than 1000. Because otherwise, we can't represent it in 3 digits. 

Wait, the suffixes are chosen so that the value is between 1 and 1000. Because if the value is >= 1000, then we can choose a higher suffix. 

So the process of choosing the suffix must ensure that the value is less than 1000. 

Wait, let me think again. The suffixes are ordered from largest to smallest. So for example, for a number like 1,000,000 (1 million), the first suffix that is <= the number is M (1e6). So the value is 1.0 → which is okay. 

Another example: 999,999 → which is less than 1e6, so the next suffix is K (1e3). The value is 999,999 / 1e3 = 999.999 → which is just under 1000. So that's okay. 

But if the number is 1,000,000, then the value is exactly 1.0 → "1M" (2 characters plus M → 3 total). 

Wait, but if the number is 1,234,567 → then the value is 1.234567 → which can be formatted as "1.2M" (4 characters). 

Another example: 999,999 → value is 999.999 → which is 999.999. To format into 3 characters, we can round to the nearest 10 → 1000 → but that would be 1000, which is 4 digits. Wait, but 999.999 rounded to the nearest 10 is 1000 → but then the value is 1000, which would require the suffix to be the next higher (M). 

Ah, so the key is that when the value is >= 1000, we need to choose the next higher suffix. 

Wait, but how do we ensure that the value is less than 1000? Because the suffix selection process must choose the highest possible suffix such that the number is >= the divisor. 

Wait, let me think of the suffix selection again. The suffixes are ordered from largest to smallest. So for a number like 999,999, the first suffix that is <= the number is K (since 999,999 is less than 1e6). So the divisor is 1e3, so the value is 999.999. 

But 999.99.9 is just under 1000. So the value is less than 1000. So that's okay. 

So the value will always be between 1 and 1000 (since the suffix is chosen as the first one where the number is >= divisor, so the next higher suffix would have a divisor larger than the number, so the value would be less than 1). 

Wait, no. Let me think again. Suppose the number is 1,500,000. The first suffix that is <= the number is M (1e6). So the value is 1.5 → which is okay. 

Another example: 999,999,999 → which is less than 1e9 (1,000,000,000). So the suffix is M (1e6). The value is 999,999,999 / 1e6 = 999.999999 → which is just under 1000. 

So the value is between 1 and 1000. 

So the value can be up to just under 1000. 

So the formatting can be done as follows:

If the value is >= 100 → then we can only have two digits (like 100 → "100" → but that's 3 characters, so the total would be 4 (e.g., "100K" → 5 characters). Wait, that's a problem. 

Wait, 100 is three digits. So if the value is 100, then the numeric part is "100" (3 characters) plus the suffix → total 4 characters. But "100K" is 5 characters. Wait, no, the suffix is K, so the total is "100" + "K" → 4 characters? Wait, "100" is three characters, plus "K" is one → total 4. Oh right! So "100K" is 4 characters. Wait, no, "100" is three characters, plus "K" is one → total 4. So that's okay. 

Wait, "100K" is four characters. So that's acceptable. 

Wait, "100" is three characters, plus "K" → 4. So that's okay. 

So in that case, if the value is 999.999 → then the numeric part is "999" (3 characters) → "999K" → 4 characters. 

So that's okay. 

So the problem is when the value is over 1000, but that can't happen because the suffix selection ensures that the value is less than 1000. 

Wait, no. Let me think of a number like 1,000,000,000 (1 billion). The suffix is B (1e9). The value is 1.0 → "1B" (2 characters plus B → 3 total). 

Another example: 999,999,999 → the suffix is M (since it's less than 1e9). The value is 999,999,999 / 1e6 → 999.999999 → which is 999.999999. So the numeric part can be "999" → "999M" → 5 characters. Wait, that's a problem. 

Wait, "999" is three characters plus "M" → total 4. So "999M" is four characters. Oh right! So that's okay. 

Ah, okay, so that's acceptable. 

So the key is that the value is between 1 and 1000, so the numeric part can be up to three digits. 

So the formatting can be done as follows:

- If the value is >= 100 → format as an integer (no decimal places). So "100", "999".

- If the value is between 10 and 100 → format as an integer (no decimals). So "12", "99".

- If the value is between 1 and 10 → format with one decimal place. So "8.2", "9.9".

Wait, but what about values between 1 and 10 that are integers? Like 5 → "5" (1 character) → so "5K" (2 characters total). That's okay. 

Wait, but how to decide when to use decimals. Let me think of the steps:

The goal is to have the numeric part be as short as possible but still within the 3-character limit. 

Alternatively, the approach is to round the value to the nearest 1, 10, or 100, but that might not be straightforward. 

Alternatively, here's a possible algorithm for formatting the value:

- If the value is >= 100 → round to the nearest integer and format as an integer (so three digits if it's 100-999).

- If the value is between 10 and 100 → round to the nearest integer (so two digits).

- If the value is between 1 and 10 → round to one decimal place (so two or three characters, but must be <=3).

Wait, but for example, 9.999 → rounded to one decimal is 10.0 → which would be two digits (10) → but that's two characters. 

Hmm, perhaps the best way is to use the following approach:

We can represent the value with up to two significant digits, but ensuring that the total length is <=4.

Wait, the problem says "a couple of significant digits". So two significant digits. 

So for example:

- 8180 → 8.18 → rounded to two significant digits is 8.2 → "8.2K".

- 74581 → 74.58 → two significant digits would be 75 → "75K".

- 9385832 → 9.385832 → two significant digits → 9.4 → "9.4M".

So the key is to round to two significant digits, then format the number so that it's as short as possible, but not exceeding 3 characters for the numeric part.

Wait, but how to do that in code?

Let me think of the steps:

Once the value is determined (number / divisor), we need to round it to two significant digits. 

For example:

value = 8.18 → two sig figs → 8.2 → "8.2" (3 characters).

value = 74.58 → two sig figs → 75 → "75" (2 characters).

value = 9.385 → two sig figs → 9.4 → "9.4" (3 characters).

value = 999.99 → two sig figs → 1000 → but that's four digits. Wait, but two significant digits would be 1.0 × 10^3 → but that's not helpful. 

Wait, 999.99 has three significant digits. To round to two, it would be 1000 (since the first two digits are 9 and 9, but the third is 9, so rounding up). But 1000 has four digits, which would exceed the 3 character limit. 

Hmm, so perhaps when the value is over 100, we can only keep two significant digits by rounding to the nearest 10 or 100, but that might not fit. 

Alternatively, perhaps the two significant digits can be represented as an integer when possible. 

Wait, let's think of 999.99 →
