Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Remember to answer all the questions

Q1.

Here are the answers to your questions, keeping in mind the limitations of IEEE 754 floating-point representation:

**Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?**

```python
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

**Output:**  This program will likely never terminate and produce an output.  Here's why:

* **Infinity Representation:**  `math.inf` in Python represents positive infinity. It's not a true mathematical infinity but a very large floating-point number.
* **Floating-Point Precision:** Due to the finite precision of IEEE 754, there will always be a tiny gap between consecutive representable floating-point numbers.  

Even though you're adding 1.0 repeatedly, `x` will never actually reach `math.inf`. It will get arbitrarily close but never quite equal.

**Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?**

```python
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

**Output:** This program will likely also never terminate and produce a definite output.

* **Exponential Growth:**  Multiplying by 1.001 repeatedly causes exponential growth.  However, due to floating-point precision limitations, `x` will eventually reach a point where further multiplication results in essentially no change.

**Q3. Consider the following program:**

```python
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

**Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.**

**Yes**, there are inputs that will lead to the output "Done". Here's why:

* **Zero or Negative `inc`:** If the user enters `inc` as 0 or a negative number, `x` will either remain at 0 or decrease. Since `x` will never reach `math.inf`, the loop will eventually terminate, and "Done" will be printed.

**Examples:**

1.  `inc = 0`
2.  `inc = -0.5`
