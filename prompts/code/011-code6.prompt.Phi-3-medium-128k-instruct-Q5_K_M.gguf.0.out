 Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.
 Yes, there are inputs that will lead to the output "Done". The program will keep incrementing the value of `x` by the value of `inc` until `x` is no longer less than `math.inf`. Since `math.inf` is a representation of infinity, the loop will never terminate if `inc` is a positive number. However, if `inc` is a negative number or zero, the loop will terminate.

Here are two examples of such inputs:

1. Enter a number: -1
   In this case, `inc` will be -1.0. The loop will terminate after the first iteration because `x` will be incremented by -1.0, making it 0.0, which is not less than `math.inf`.

2. Enter a number: 0
   In this case, `inc` will be 0.0. The loop will terminate immediately because `x` will not be incremented, and it is already equal to `math.inf`.

Note that if you enter a positive number, the loop will never terminate, and the program will keep running indefinitely.
