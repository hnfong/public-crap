Here's a Python solution to the problem:

```python
def compact(n):
    if n == 0:
        return "0"
    elif n < 1000:
        return str(n)
    else:
        magnitude = 0
        while n >= 1000:
            magnitude += 1
            n /= 1000
        return "{:.1f}{}".format(n, "kMGTPEZ"[magnitude])
```

This function first checks if the input number is zero. If it is, it returns the string "0". If the number is less than 1000, it simply returns the number as a string. Otherwise, it enters a loop that calculates the magnitude of the number (i.e., the power of 1000 that the number is a multiple of). It then uses this magnitude to determine which character from the string "kMGTPEZ" to append to the end of the string representation of the number.

The function uses the format method of strings to format the number with one significant figure and the appropriate character. The result is a string that represents the number in a compact, human-readable form, as required by the problem statement.

This solution should handle all edge cases you can think of, as it correctly handles zero, numbers less than 1000, and numbers greater than or equal to 1000.
