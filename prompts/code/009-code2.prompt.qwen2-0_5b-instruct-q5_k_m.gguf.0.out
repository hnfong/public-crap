Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

assistant
```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    """
    Searches for a target in a sorted file and returns its position.
    
    Args:
    file_path: A string representing the file path to the text file.
    target: A string representing the target name to search for.
    
    Returns:
    An integer representing the position of the target in the sorted file.
    """
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Read the file line by line and check if the target name matches
        for line in file:
            parts = line.split()
            if parts == sorted(parts):
                # Use bisect_left to find the insertion point
                index = bisect.bisect_left(parts, target)
                return index
    # If target is not found, return -1
    return -1

# Example check function to verify the correctness of the solution
def check_solution():
    assert binary_search_file("names.txt", "John") == 1, "Test case 1 failed"
    assert binary_search_file("names.txt", "Smith") == 0, "Test case 2 failed"
    assert binary_search_file("names.txt", "Kane") == 4, "Test case 3 failed"
    print("All test cases passed!")

check_solution()
```

This solution uses the `bisect` module in Python to find the insertion point of a target name in a sorted file. It reads the file line by line, splits each line into parts, and checks if the target part is in the correct order. The `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module is used to find the insertion point, which is then returned. The check function provides examples of how to use the solution and verify its correctness.
