Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```python
def compact_number(num):
    if num < 10:
        return str(num)
    elif num < 100:
        return f"{num:.1f}k"
    elif num < 1000:
        return f"{num:.1f}k"
    elif num < 10000:
        return f"{num:.1f}M"
    elif num < 100000:
        return f"{num:.1f}M"
    elif num < 1000000:
        return f"{num:.1f}B"
    elif num < 10000000:
        return f"{num:.1f}T"
    elif num < 100000000:
        return f"{num:.1f}P"
    elif num < 1000000000:
        return f"{num:.1f}E"
    else:
        return f"{num:.1f}Z"

# Test the function
print(compact_number(2))  # Output: 2
print(compact_number(800))  # Output: 0.8k
print(compact_number(9385832))  # Output: 9.4M
```

This function first checks if the number is less than 10, in which case it simply returns the number as a string. If the number is between 10 and 99, it adds a 'k' to the end of the string to represent thousands. This process is repeated for each order of magnitude (k, M, B, T, P, E, Z) until the number is within the desired range of characters. If the number is too large to fit within the desired range, it simply returns the number as a string with all its significant digits. [end of text]
