You're right, performing a traditional binary search directly on a file requires careful consideration due to the sequential nature of file access. We can't directly jump to the middle of a file like we can with an in-memory array.

Here's a breakdown of how to adapt binary search for file-based data and a Python implementation:

**Understanding the Challenges**

1. **Sequential Access:** Files are accessed sequentially. To reach a specific point, we need to read through all preceding data.

2. **No Random Access:** Unlike arrays, we can't directly access elements by index.

**The Strategy**

1. **File Pointers:** We'll use file pointers to keep track of our search range within the file.

2. **Line-by-Line Comparison:** We'll read lines from the file one at a time, comparing them to our target.

3. **Adjusting the Search Range:** Based on the comparison, we'll update our file pointers to narrow down the search range.

**Python Implementation**

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        left = 0
        right = file.seek(0, 2)  # Get file size (number of bytes)
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            file.seek(mid)
            line = file.readline().strip()
            if line == target:
                return mid  # Found the target
            elif line < target:
                left = mid + len(line) + 1  # Move left pointer past the current line
            else:
                right = mid  # Move right pointer to mid

        return left  # Insertion point

```

**Explanation**

1. **File Opening:** The code opens the file in read mode (`'r'`).

2. **Initialization:**
   - `left`: Pointer to the beginning of the file (byte offset 0).
   - `right`: Pointer to the end of the file (obtained using `file.seek(0, 2)`).

3. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - `mid`: Calculate the middle point between `left` and `right`.
   - `file.seek(mid)`: Move the file pointer to the `mid` position.
   - `line = file.readline().strip()`: Read the line at the `mid` position and remove any leading/trailing whitespace.
   - **Comparison:**
     - If `line == target`: Target found, return the current file pointer position (`mid`).
     - If `line < target`: Target is potentially in the right half, update `left` to `mid + len(line) + 1` (move past the current line).
     - If `line > target`: Target is potentially in the left half, update `right` to `mid`.

4. **Insertion Point:** If the loop completes without finding the target, `left` will point to the insertion point where the target should be inserted to maintain sorted order.

**Important Considerations**

- **File Size:** This approach is most efficient for relatively large files where the overhead of sequential reads is outweighed by the logarithmic search time.

- **Line Lengths:** The code assumes relatively consistent line lengths. If line lengths vary significantly, the `left` pointer adjustment might need refinement.

- **Encoding:** Ensure the file encoding matches the encoding used when reading the file (e.g., UTF-8).
