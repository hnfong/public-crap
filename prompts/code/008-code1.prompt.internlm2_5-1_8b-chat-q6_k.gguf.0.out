Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Sure, here are the implementations of bubble sort and merge sort in Python:

Bubble Sort:
```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr
```

Merge Sort:
```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left_half = arr[:mid]
        right_half = arr[mid:]

        merge_sort(left_half)
        merge_sort(right_half)

        i = j = k = 0

        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
                arr[k] = left_half[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right_half[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        while i < len(left_half):
            arr[k] = left_half[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1

        while j < len(right_half):
            arr[k] = right_half[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1

    return arr
```

Now let's discuss the two algorithms and compare them:

Bubble Sort:
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case.

Merge Sort:
Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, sorts them separately, and then merges them. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case. Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm, meaning that it maintains the relative order of equal elements in the sorted output.

In terms of performance, merge sort is generally faster than bubble sort for large datasets. However, bubble sort can be useful for small datasets or for educational purposes due to its simplicity. [end of text]
