Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Sure, here are two implementations of sorting algorithms - bubble sort and merge sort. 

```python
def bubble_sort(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        for j in range(i+1, len(lst)):
            if lst[i] > lst[j]:
                lst[i], lst[j] = lst[j], lst[i]

    return lst

def merge_sort(lst):
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return lst

    mid = len(lst) // 2
    left = lst[:mid]
    right = lst[mid:]
    
    left = merge_sort(left)
    right = merge_sort(right)

    return merge(left, right)

```

### Merge Sort
Merge sort is a stable sorting algorithm. It is an efficient algorithm with a time complexity of O(n log n). It divides the input array into two sub-arrays, sorts them independently, and then merges them back together to produce the final sorted output.

### Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping two adjacent elements if they are out of order. It has a time complexity of O(n^2), which means it becomes less efficient as the input size increases.

### Comparison:
Both algorithms are effective in their own ways, but Merge Sort is generally considered to be more efficient for larger inputs. In terms of stability, Merge Sort is a stable sort, meaning that the original order of equal elements is preserved. Bubble Sort, on the other hand, is not a stable sort. Therefore, if the input array contains any equal elements, the output may be different from the input, depending on the order in which the equal elements were encountered during the sorting process.<|im_end|>
