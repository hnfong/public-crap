What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)

The program will run indefinitely and will not produce any output. This is because `math.inf` is a special value that represents infinity, and `x` will never reach infinity.

In Python, `while` loops will continue to execute as long as the condition is true. In this case, the condition is `x < math.inf`, which will always be true because `x` will never reach infinity. Therefore, the loop will run indefinitely, and the `print(x)` statement will never be reached.

It's worth noting that if you try to run this program, it will likely consume all available CPU resources and may cause your system to become unresponsive. It's generally not a good idea to write programs that intentionally enter an infinite loop!
