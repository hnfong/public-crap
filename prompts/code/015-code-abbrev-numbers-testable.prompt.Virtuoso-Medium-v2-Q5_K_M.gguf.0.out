```python
def abbrev_num(x):
    if x < 1000:
        return str(x)
    units = ['K', 'M', 'B', 'T']
    for i, unit in enumerate(units):
        if x < 1000**(i+1):
            return f"{round(x / 1000**i, 1)}{unit}" if i == 0 else f"{round(x / 1000**i, 1):.1f}{unit}"
    return f"{round(x / 1000**len(units), 1)}{units[-1]}"
```

This function first checks if the input number is less than 1000, in which case it simply returns the number as a string. If the number is larger, it iterates through a list of units ('K', 'M', 'B', 'T') and checks if the number is less than the next power of 1000. If so, it formats the number with one decimal place and appends the appropriate unit. If the number is larger than the largest unit, it formats the number with one decimal place and appends the largest unit. The function uses f-strings for formatting and the round function to round the number to one decimal place. The if statement inside the for loop ensures that the number is formatted with one decimal place only if the unit is 'K', otherwise it formats the number with one decimal place and removes trailing zeros. This ensures that the output string is always <= 4 characters. [end of text]
