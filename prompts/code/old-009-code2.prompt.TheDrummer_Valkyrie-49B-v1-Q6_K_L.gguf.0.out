To perform a binary search on a text file directly with at most O(log(n)) operations, we can use the following approach:

1.  **Estimate the total number of lines**: Open the file and read the total number of lines. This can be done by reading the file line by line until the end is reached, counting the lines. This operation takes O(n) time but only needs to be done once.

2.  **Perform binary search**:
    *   Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to the total number of lines minus 1.
    *   While `low` is less than or equal to `high`:
        *   Calculate the middle index `mid` as `(low + high) // 2`.
        *   Seek to the `mid`-th line in the file and read it.
        *   Compare the line with the target:
            *   If the line is less than the target, set `low` to `mid + 1`.
            *   If the line is greater than the target, set `high` to `mid - 1`.
            *   If the line is equal to the target, return `mid` as the position of the target.
    *   If the loop ends without finding the target, return `low` as the insertion point.

Here is a Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    """
    Perform a binary search on a text file with lines sorted in lexicographical order.

    Args:
    file_path (str): The path to the text file.
    target (str): The target name to search for.

    Returns:
    int: The position of the target if found, or the insertion point if not found.
    """
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Estimate the total number of lines
        total_lines = sum(1 for _ in file)
        file.seek(0)  # Reset the file pointer to the beginning

        low = 0
        high = total_lines - 1

        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            # Seek to the mid-th line and read it
            for _ in range(mid):
                file.readline()
            line = file.readline().strip()

            if line < target:
                low = mid + 1
            elif line > target:
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                return mid

        return low
```

**Example usage:**

Suppose we have a text file `names.txt` containing the following lines:

```
Alice
Bob
Charlie
David
Eve
```

We can search for the name "David" using the `binary_search_file` function:

```python
position = binary_search_file('names.txt', 'David')
print(position)  # Output: 3
```

If we search for a name that is not in the file, the function will return the insertion point:

```python
insertion_point = binary_search_file('names.txt', 'Frank')
print(insertion_point)  # Output: 4
```

This approach allows us to perform a binary search on a text file directly with at most O(log(n)) operations, where n is the total number of lines in the file. The key idea is to estimate the total number of lines and then use binary search to find the target or determine the insertion point. [end of text]
