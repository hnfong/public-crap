What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)

assistant
The output of the given Python program is:

Infinity

This is because the value of `x` is greater than infinity, so the program will keep asking for input until it reaches the value of infinity. The `while` loop will continue to execute indefinitely, and the program will print `Infinity` until the user enters a non-negative value. [end of text]
