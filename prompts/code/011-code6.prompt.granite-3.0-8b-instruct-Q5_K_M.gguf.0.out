Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Yes, there are inputs that will lead to the output "Done". Here are two examples:

1. If you input a positive number, such as 1, the program will keep adding that number to x until it reaches infinity. However, since x starts at 0, it will never actually reach infinity, but it will keep adding the number to x indefinitely.
2. If you input a negative number, such as -1, the program will keep subtracting that number from x until it reaches negative infinity. However, since x starts at 0, it will never actually reach negative infinity, but it will keep subtracting the number from x indefinitely.

In both cases, the program will never reach the condition `x < math.inf` because x will never be less than infinity. Therefore, the output "Done" will never be printed.
