We are going to perform a binary search on a sorted text file.
 Steps:
 1. Open the file and read all the lines into a list? But note: the file might be very large, so we don't want to read all lines into memory at once.
 2. Instead, we can use the file as a sequence and perform binary search by seeking to the appropriate byte positions.

 However, note: the problem says the lines are sorted in lexicographical order. We are searching for a target string (b"2 by").

 We cannot read the entire file into memory if it's too large. So we need to:
   - Find the total size of the file (number of bytes) to know the boundaries.
   - But note: we are searching for a string that might be split across lines? The problem says the lines are sorted, so we assume the target is a complete line.

 Approach:
   We can treat the file as an array of lines, but without loading all lines. We can use the fact that the lines are sorted and the file is a sequence.

   Steps for binary search on a file:
   a. Open the file and get the total number of bytes (or the last byte position) to set the high boundary.
   b. We need to be able to read a line given a starting position. We can use `seek` and `readline` but note that `readline` might read partial lines if we are not careful.

   However, note: the file is sorted by lines, so each line is in order. We can do:

   Let low = 0, high = total_bytes (but note: we are dealing with lines, so we might want to consider the entire file as a list of lines, but without loading them all).

   We can define a function to read the line at a given position (by seeking to that position and reading until the newline). But note: the target might be split across two lines? 
   The problem says the lines are sorted, so we are searching for a complete line. We assume the target is a complete line.

   But note: the example target is b"2 by", which is a complete line.

   However, the problem says "or the insertion point", so if the target is not found, we return the position where it would be inserted.

   Steps:

   1. Open the file in binary mode to be able to seek by bytes.
   2. Get the total size of the file (in bytes).
   3. We'll set low = 0, high = total_size (but note: the last line doesn't have a newline at the end? We have to be cautious).

   But note: the file might not have a newline at the end of the last line. We are going to consider the entire file as a list of lines, and the lines are separated by newline characters.

   We can do:

   - We'll consider the entire file as a sequence of lines, each line ending with a newline (except possibly the last one). But the problem doesn't specify, so we must handle the case where the last line might not have a newline.

   However, the problem says the lines are sorted in lexicographical order. We can assume that the file is stored with each line ending by a newline, but we should check the last line.

   Alternatively, we can read the entire file and then split by newline? But that would load the entire file into memory, which we want to avoid.

   We need a way to read a line from a given position without reading the entire file.

   Let's define a helper function: `get_line_start_end(file, pos)`
        This function will return the start and end byte positions of the line that contains the byte at position `pos`.

   How?
        - We can seek to `pos` and then read until we find a newline (to get the end of the line) and then go backwards to find the start of the line.

   But note: we are doing binary search, so we need to compare the target string with the entire line (as a string) at a given position.

   Steps for helper function:

        def get_line_start_end(file, pos):
            file.seek(pos)
            # Read the current line from the current position until the end of the line (newline)
            # But we don't know the length of the line, so we can read until we find a newline.
            # However, we are in binary mode, so we can read until we hit a b'\n' or the end of the file.

            # First, let's read the current line to the end (until newline or EOF)
            current = file.readline()
            # But note: readline returns a string in text mode, but we are in binary mode so we get bytes.
            # We are going to use the current position to find the start of the line.

            # Now, we need to go back to the beginning of the line. We can use the fact that the line starts at the beginning of the file or at a newline.
            # We can move backwards until we find a newline or the beginning of the file.

            # However, we don't want to read the entire file backwards. We can use the current position and then move backwards until we find a newline.

            # Let's get the current position after reading the line.
            end_pos = file.tell()
            # Now, we need to find the start of the line. We can move backwards until we find a newline or the beginning of the file.
            start_pos = pos
            # We are going to move backwards until we find a newline or the beginning of the file.
            while start_pos > 0:
                # We are going to check the character at start_pos-1 (if it exists) to see if it's a newline.
                file.seek(start_pos - 1)
                # Read one character backwards? But we are in binary mode, so we can read one byte.
                prev_char = file.read(1)
                if prev_char == b'\n':
                    break
                start_pos -= 1
            else:
                # If we reached the beginning and didn't find a newline, then the line starts at 0.
                start_pos = 0

            # But note: the above method might be inefficient if we are at the beginning of the file and the line is very long? 
            # Actually, we are only moving backwards until we find a newline, which is the start of the line. However, the start of the line is the beginning of the file or the last newline before the current position.

            # However, we must consider that the file might not have a newline at the beginning. But the first line starts at 0, so we are okay.

            # But note: the above method for finding the start of the line is not entirely correct because we are reading one byte at a time and then moving backwards. 
            # We are actually reading the newline character and then setting start_pos to the position after that newline. But note: the newline is at start_pos-1, so the line starts at start_pos-1+1? 
            # Actually, we break when we find a newline at start_pos-1, so the line starts at start_pos (the position we were at initially) and the newline is at start_pos-1.

            # Let me correct: We are starting at `pos` and then we want to find the start of the line. We are moving backwards until we find a newline. The start of the line is the position right after that newline.

            # But note: the above code moves backwards until it finds a newline, and then sets start_pos to the original `pos`? Actually, no: we are moving backwards and updating start_pos until we find a newline.

            # Actually, the above code does:
            #   We start at `pos` and then we set start_pos = pos, then we go to start_pos-1 and check if it's a newline. If it is, then we break and the line starts at start_pos (which is the original pos). 
            #   But if we don't find a newline, we keep decreasing start_pos until we hit 0.

            # However, we are reading the entire line from `pos` to the end of the line (which we did with readline). Then we set the end_pos to the current position (which is the end of the line). 
            # Then we move backwards from `pos` (the original position) until we find a newline, and then we set the start of the line to `pos` (the original) and the end to `end_pos` (the current).

            # But wait, we are reading the line from `pos` and then the file pointer moves to the end of that line. Then we want to get the start of the line, which is the position of the newline plus one? 
            # Actually, the line starts at the position after the newline that precedes it (or at 0 if it's the first line). So we are doing:

            #   We are at `pos` (the position we were given). We read the line and then the file pointer is at the end of the line (without the newline? Actually, in binary mode, readline includes the newline if present).

            #   According to the Python docs for `readline` in binary mode: 
            #       "Read until (but not including) the delimiter, which defaults to b'\n' (a newline). The I/O operation may return any number of bytes including zero, and if the file ends before the delimiter is reached, the delimiter is not returned."
            #   So if the line ends without a newline, then readline returns the entire line without the trailing newline.

            #   But note: the file is sorted by lines, so we assume each line is terminated by a newline? The example file has newlines.

            #   However, the problem does not specify, so we must be cautious.

            #   Let's assume the file uses b'\n' to separate lines. Then the helper function should work.

            #   But note: the above helper function does not account for the fact that the line we read might be the first line (so no newline at the beginning). We are starting at `pos` and then reading the line, then we try to find the start of the line by going backwards until we find a newline.

            #   This is correct because the first line starts at 0 and there is no newline before it.

            #   However, we are reading the entire line from `pos` and then we are going to use that line for comparison. We must be cautious because the line might extend to the end of the file (if there's no newline at the end).

            #   We can adjust: if we are at the end of the file, then the line is from `start_pos` to the end.

            #   But note: the helper function above does not handle the case where the line we are reading is the last line and there's no newline at the end. We are reading until the newline or EOF, so if there's no newline, then the line we read is from `pos` to the end of the file.

            #   Then, when we try to find the start of the line, we are going backwards until we find a newline. If we don't find one, then the start is 0? Actually, no: we are starting at `pos` and going backwards until we hit the beginning or a newline. So if `pos` is at the beginning, then we break at 0.

            #   However, we must note that the file might not have a newline at the end of the last line. So the last line is from the last newline (or beginning) to the end of the file.

            #   This helper function returns the start and end of the line that contains the byte at `pos`. But note: the line might be the entire file if there's no newline? Then we are reading the entire file and then we are going to set the start to 0 and the end to the end of the file.

            #   But wait, we are reading the line from `pos` and then the file pointer moves to the end of that line (which might be the end of the file). Then we try to find the start by going backwards until we find a newline. If we don't find one, then the start is 0 and the end is the end of the file.

            #   This is acceptable.

            #   However, note: the helper function above does not work if the target is at the beginning of the file and we are at position 0. We are reading the line from 0, then we try to go back to -1, which is invalid. So we must adjust.

            #   Let's rewrite the helper function to be safe:

            #   We are going to read the line from `pos` and then set the end position. Then we are going to find the start of the line by moving backwards until we find a newline or the beginning.

            #   But note: we cannot seek to a negative position. So we must check that `pos` is not 0.

            #   Alternatively, we can do:

            #   We are going to read the line from `pos` and then set the end position. Then we are going to set the start position to `pos` and then move backwards until we find a newline or the beginning.

            #   However, we are already at `pos` and we read the line, so we are at the end of the line. Then we want to find the start of the line, which is the position of the newline that precedes it (or 0 if none).

            #   We can do:

            #       start_pos = pos
            #       while start_pos > 0:
            #           start_pos -= 1
            #           file.seek(start_pos)
            #           # Check if the character at start_pos is a newline? But note: we are at the beginning of the line if we find a newline at start_pos-1, but then we are at the newline character at start_pos-1, so we want to set the start of the line to start_pos (the newline) and then the actual start is start_pos+1? 
            #           # Actually, we want the start of the line to be the position after the newline. So if we find a newline at position `p`, then the line starts at `p+1`.

            #   But note: we are reading the line from `pos` and then we are at the end of the line. We want to find the start of the line, which is the beginning of the line (the first non-newline character after a newline or the beginning of the file).

            #   Let me change the helper function:

            #   We are going to read the line from `pos` and then set the end position. Then we are going to find the start of the line by moving backwards until we find a newline or the beginning.

            #   However, we are at the end of the line. We can do:

            #       start_pos = pos
            #       while start_pos > 0:
            #           file.seek(start_pos - 1)
            #           if file.read(1) == b'\n':
            #               start_pos = start_pos - 1 + 1   # because the newline is at start_pos-1, so the line starts at start_pos-1+1 = start_pos
            #               Actually, we want the start of the line to be the position after the newline. So if we find a newline at `start_pos-1`, then the line starts at `start_pos` (the current position) and the newline is at `start_pos-1`. But note: we are at `start_pos` (the original) and then we move backwards to `start_pos-1` and read a newline. Then we set the start of the line to `start_pos` (the original) and the end to the end of the line we read.

            #   Wait, that doesn't change the start_pos. We are breaking when we find a newline, but we are not adjusting the start_pos to be the beginning of the line.

            #   Let me clarify: The line we are reading is from `pos` to the end of the line (without the newline if it's the last line). The start of the line is the position right after the newline that comes before it (or 0 if it's the first line). So if we find a newline at `start_pos-1`, then the start of the line is `start_pos` (the current position) and the newline is at `start_pos-1`. But note: we are at `start_pos` (the current position) and we are going to set the start of the line to `start_pos` (the current position) and the end to the end of the line we read.

            #   However, the above code does not set the start of the line to the beginning of the line. It sets `start_pos` to the original `pos` and then moves backwards until it finds a newline, but then it doesn't adjust the start_pos to be the beginning of the line.

            #   Actually, the above code is flawed. We are reading the line from `pos` and then we are at the end of the line. Then we want to find the start of the line, which is the beginning of the line (the first character of the line). We can do:

            #       We are at `pos` (the position we were given). We read the line and then the file pointer is at the end of the line (without the newline if it's the last line). Then we want to find the start of the line by moving backwards until we find a newline or the beginning.

            #       Let start_byte = pos
            #       Then, we move backwards until we find a newline. But note: the newline is the separator, so the line starts at the position after the newline.

            #       We can do:

            #           file.seek(pos)
            #           # We are going to read the line from pos, but we don't want to lose the current position? We already did readline, so we are at the end.

            #       Alternatively, we can read the line without moving the file pointer? We can use `peek` but that doesn't help.

            #   Let's change the approach for the helper function:

            #   We are going to read the entire file and split by newline? But that would load the entire file, which we don't want.

            #   Another approach: we can use the `file.seekable()` to check if we can seek, and then we can read the entire file in chunks? But that would be inefficient.

            #   Alternatively, we can use the `mmap` module to map the file into memory, but then we are loading the entire file.

            #   Since the problem says the file is sorted and we want to do binary search with O(log n) operations, we must avoid loading the entire file.

            #   We can do:

            #       We are going to read the file in binary mode and then use the fact that the lines are separated by b'\n'. We can find the total number of lines by counting the newlines and then adding one for the last line.

            #   But note: we don't want to count the lines because that would require reading the entire file.

            #   We can do a binary search by:

            #       low = 0
            #       high = total_bytes - 1   (but we don't know the total_bytes until we open the file)

            #   However, we can get the total_bytes by `os.path.getsize(file_path)` or by `file.seek(0,2)`.

            #   Let me propose a different method:

            #   We can use the `file.seek` and `file.tell` to navigate, but we need to know the length of each line? Not exactly, but we can read a line by reading until we hit a newline.

            #   We can do:

            #       low = 0
            #       high = total_bytes   (we consider the entire file as a list of lines, and the last line goes from the last newline to the end)

            #   But note: the binary search is on the lines, not on the bytes. We are comparing the target string with the entire line (as a string). So we need to read the entire line (which might be long) but we are only doing O(log n) such reads.

            #   Steps for binary search:

            #       We are going to search for the target string in the lexicographical order of the lines.

            #       We can set:
            #           low = 0
            #           high = total_bytes   (meaning the position just after the last byte)

            #       Then, while low < high:
            #           mid = (low + high) // 2
            #           # Get the line that contains the byte at mid
            #           start, end = get_line_start_end(file, mid)
            #           line = file.read(end - start + 1)   # but note: we are at the end of the line, so we need to seek to start and then read until end.
            #           # Compare the target string with the line (as a string, but note: the file is in bytes mode, so we are comparing bytes)

            #       However, note: the helper function above returns the start and end of the line. But we are reading the line from the current position (which is the end of the line) so we need to reset the file pointer? 

            #   We must be cautious: the file pointer is moving as we read. We can use the helper function to get the start and end, then seek to the start and read the line.

            #   Revised helper function:

            #       def get_line_start_end(file, pos):
            #           # We are going to find the start of the line that contains the byte at `pos`
            #           # First, we need to know the total size? We don't, but we can seek to pos and then move backwards until we find a newline or the beginning.
            #           # We are going to set the file pointer to pos and then move backwards until we find a newline.
            #           # But note: we cannot change the file pointer if we are going to use it for the binary search? We are going to use the same file object, so we must save the current position.

            #           # We are going to save the current position and then move backwards to find the start.
            #           current_pos = file.tell()
            #           file.seek(pos)
            #           start_pos = pos
            #           # We are going to move backwards until we find a newline or the beginning.
            #           while start_pos > 0:

            #           else:
            #               start_pos = 0

            #           # Now, we need to find the end of the line. We are at start_pos (the beginning of the line) and we want to move forward until we hit a newline or the end of the file.
            #           file.seek(start_pos)
            #           end_pos = start_pos
            #           while end_pos < total_bytes:   # we don't have total_bytes here, but we can get it by file.seek(0,2) and then file.tell()? But we are in the middle of the file.
            #               file.seek(end_pos)
            #               if file.read(1) == b'\n':
            #                   break
            #               end_pos += 1
            #           else:
            #               end_pos = total_bytes   # if we reach the end of the file without finding a newline, then the line goes to the end.

            #           # But note: we don't know total_bytes until we open the file and get the size. We can get total_bytes by file.seek(0,2) and then file.tell() at the beginning.

            #           # However, we are inside the helper function and we don't have total_bytes. We can pass total_bytes to the helper function? Or we can get it once outside.

            #   Alternatively, we can get the total_bytes once and then use it in the helper function.

            #   Let's do:

            #       total_bytes = file.seek(0,2)   # this returns the total size in bytes, but note: the file might not have a newline at the end, so the last line goes from the last newline to the end.

            #   But note: the file might be empty.

            #   We can do:

            #       total_bytes = file.seek(0,2)
            #       if total_bytes == 0:
            #           return (0,0)

            #   Then, in the helper function, we can use total_bytes.

            #   However, note: the file pointer is at 0 after we seek(0,0). We must save the current position.

            #   Let me restructure:

            #       We are going to open the file and get the total_bytes first.

            #       Then, we set low = 0, high = total_bytes (meaning the high boundary is the end of the file, and we are considering the entire file as a list of lines).

            #       Then, we do binary search by:

            #           while low < high:
            #               mid = (low + high) // 2
            #               # Get the line that contains the byte at mid
            #               start, end = get_line_start_end(file, mid, total_bytes)
            #               # Now, we are at the end of the file? We need to reset the file pointer to the beginning of the file? Or we can use the helper function to return the start and end and then read the line without moving the pointer too much.

            #   But note: the helper function above moves the file pointer. We need to be able to read the line without affecting the binary search state too much? Actually, we are going to do multiple reads, so we must reset the file pointer to the beginning of the file after each read? That would be inefficient.

            #   Alternatively, we can design the helper function to not move the file pointer (except for the necessary seeks) and then return the start and end without reading the entire line.

            #   We can do:

            #       def get_line_start_end(file, pos, total_bytes):
            #           # We are given the file object and the total_bytes, and we are at position `pos`
            #           # We want to find the start and end of the line that contains the byte at `pos`
            #           # First, find the start of the line by moving backwards until we find a newline or the beginning.
            #           start_pos = pos
            #           while start_pos > 0:
            #               file.seek(start_pos - 1)
            #               if file.read(1) == b'\n':
            #                   break
            #               start_pos -= 1
            #           else:
            #               start_pos = 0

            #           # Now, find the end of the line by moving forward until we find a newline or the end of the file.
            #           end_pos = start_pos
            #           while end_pos < total_bytes:
            #               file.seek(end_pos)
            #               if file.read(1) == b'\n':
            #                   break
            #               end_pos += 1
            #           else:
            #               end_pos = total_bytes

            #           # But note: we are now at end_pos (the position of the newline or the end of the file). We need to reset the file pointer to the original position? 
            #           # Actually, we are going to read the line from start_pos to end_pos, but then we are going to use the file pointer for the next comparison. 
            #           # We must reset the file pointer to the original position? Or we can leave it and then in the binary search we are going to use the same file object and we are going to read the line again? 

            #   This is getting messy. We are doing O(log n) reads, but each read might require moving the file pointer a lot and then resetting it? 

            #   Alternatively, we can read the entire line in the helper function and then return it, but then we are reading the entire line and we don't want to do that if the line is very long.

            #   But note: the problem says we are allowed to do at most O(log n) operations, and each operation is a read of a line (which might be long). However, the total number of lines is n, and we are doing O(log n) iterations, so we are reading O(log n) lines. But if each line is very long, then the total data read might be O(n) in the worst case? 

            #   Example: if we have 1000 lines, and each line is 1000 bytes, then we are reading 10 lines (log2(1000) is about 10) and the total data read is 10*1000 = 10000 bytes, which is acceptable.

            #   But if the lines are very long and we are doing binary search on a file with many lines, then the total data read might be large. However, the problem does not specify the line length, so we assume that reading a line is acceptable because we are only doing O(log n) reads.

            #   So let's do:

            #       We are going to read the entire file once to get the total_bytes and then split the file into lines by reading each line? But that would be O(n) reads.

            #   We must stick to the binary search without reading the entire file.

            #   Revised plan:

            #       We are going to do a binary search on the byte positions, but we are going to read the entire line (from start to end) for the mid position. We are allowed to do O(log n) reads, and each read is a line (which might be long). 

            #       Steps:

            #           1. Open the file and get the total_bytes.
            #           2. Set low = 0, high = total_bytes.
            #           3. While low < high:
            #               mid = (low + high) // 2
            #               # Get the line that contains the byte at mid
            #               start, end = get_line_start_end(file, mid, total_bytes)
            #               # Now, we are at the end of the line (end_pos) in the file. We need to read the entire line from start to end.
            #               file.seek(start)
            #               line = file.read(end - start + 1)
            #               # Compare the target string with the line (as a string, but note: the file is in bytes, so we are comparing bytes)
            #               if line == target:
            #                   return start   # or the position of the first byte of the line? But note: the problem returns the (byte) position of the target, which is the start of the line.
            #               elif line < target:
            #                   low = end + 1   # because the line is less than target, so we move to the next line
            #               else:
            #                   high = start - 1

            #       But note: the comparison is lexicographical, and we are comparing bytes. The target is given as bytes (b"2 by").

            #       However, what if the target is not found? We return the insertion point, which is the position where the target would be inserted. In bisect_left, we return the index of the first element that is not less than the target. But note: we are returning the start of the line (the byte position) for the found case.

            #       We are to return the insertion point (the byte position) as in bisect_left.

            #       In the binary search, if we are searching for a target that is not found, we return the position of the first byte of the line where the target would be inserted.

            #       But note: the insertion point is the position where the target would be inserted to maintain sorted order. In the file, that would be the start of the line at that position.

            #       However, the problem says "or the insertion point (as in 'bisect_left')", meaning the position of the first byte of the line where the target would be inserted.

            #       But note: the bisect_left returns the index (position) in the list where the target would be inserted. In our case, the list is the lines, and the index is the byte position of the first byte of that line.

            #       So we are returning the start of the line for the insertion point.

            #       However, the above binary search does not exactly mimic bisect_left because:

            #           We are comparing the entire line (which is a string) with the target (which is a string). But note: the lines are sorted in lexicographical order, and the target is a string that is the same as one of the lines.

            #       But what if the target is not found? We are returning the start of the line where the target would be inserted. However, note that the insertion point might be in the middle of a line? 

            #       Actually, the insertion point is defined as the position in the list (the list of lines) where the target would be inserted. Since the list is the lines, and each line is a string, the insertion point is the start of the line.

            #       But note: the file is a sequence of bytes, and we are returning the byte position (start) of the line. That is the insertion point.

            #       However, the above binary search does:

            #           if line == target: return start
            #           elif line < target: low = end + 1
            #           else: high = start - 1

            #       This is correct for bisect_left? 

            #       Example: 
            #           lines = [b'1 I go to school', b'2 by bus', b'foo bar', b'hello world', b'zoo zoo zoo']
            #           We are searching for b'2 by'

            #           The first line is less than target, so we move low to the end of the first line + 1.
            #           Then we compare the next line (which is the second line) and if it's equal we return its start.

            #       But note: the target might be split across two lines? We are assuming the target is a complete line.

            #       Also, note: the file might have multiple lines with the same content? Then we return the first occurrence.

            #       However, the problem says the lines are sorted, so if there are duplicates, they are adjacent. We are returning the first occurrence.

            #       But note: the example file does not have duplicates.

            #   However, there is a problem: the helper function `get_line_start_end` must be able to handle the case where the target is found in the middle of a line? 

            #   The problem says the lines are sorted, so we are comparing entire lines. But note: the target might be a substring of a line? 

            #   The problem says: "returns the (byte) position of the target", meaning the first byte of the target in the file? But note: the example returns 17, which is the start of the line containing "2 by".

            #   But wait, the example file:

            #       1 I go to school
            #       2 by bus
            #       foo bar
            #       hello world
            #       zoo zoo zoo

            #   The target is b"2 by", which is the entire second line. So we are returning the start of that line.

            #   However, the problem says "or the insertion point", so if the target is not found, we return the start of the line where it would be inserted.

            #   But note: the insertion point is the start of the line, not the position within the line.

            #   So the function should return the start of the line (the byte position) for both found and insertion point.

            #   However, the above binary search does not work if the target is found in the middle of a line? Because we are comparing entire lines.

            #   The problem says the lines are sorted, so we are only concerned with entire lines. We are not searching for a substring within a line.

            #   But note: the example target is a complete line.

            #   So we assume the target is a complete line.

            #   However, what if the target is not a complete line? Then we are comparing a string that is shorter than the line? 

            #   The problem says: "names sorted in lexicographical order", and the example target is a complete line. We are to return the insertion point (the start of the line) for the target.

            #   But note: the bisect_left in the list of lines would compare the entire line. So if the target is a prefix of a line, then the line is greater than the target? 

            #   Example: 
            #       lines = [b'apple', b'banana', b'apricot']
            #       target = b'ap'
            #       Then, in bisect_left, we would compare b'ap' with the first line: b'apple' > b'ap'? Actually, no: lexicographical comparison is done by the entire string. But note: the bisect_left is defined on the list of strings, and the comparison is done
