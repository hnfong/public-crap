What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)

The eventual output of the given Python program is `inf`.

Here's why:

- The `while` loop will continue to execute indefinitely as long as the condition `x < math.inf` is true.
- Since `math.inf` is a mathematical constant representing infinity, the loop will never terminate.
- As a result, the program will print `inf` as the final output.

Note that this program is not a typical use case for a `while` loop, as it's designed to run indefinitely and never terminate. It's more of a demonstration of the behavior of the `math.inf` constant. [end of text]
