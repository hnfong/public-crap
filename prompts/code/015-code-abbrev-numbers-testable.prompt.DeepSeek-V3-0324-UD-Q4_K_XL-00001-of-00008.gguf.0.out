Here's the Python function `abbrev_num(x)` that meets your requirements:

```python
def abbrev_num(x):
    if x < 1000:
        return str(x)
    suffixes = ['K', 'M', 'B', 'T']  # K for thousand, M for million, etc.
    magnitude = 0
    while x >= 1000 and magnitude < len(suffixes) - 1:
        x /= 1000.0
        magnitude += 1
    # Round to nearest and check if decimal is needed
    rounded = round(x, 1)
    if rounded.is_integer() or len(f"{int(rounded)}") + 1 + len(suffixes[magnitude-1]) > 4:
        return f"{int(rounded)}{suffixes[magnitude-1]}"
    else:
        return f"{rounded}{suffixes[magnitude-1]}".replace(".0", "")
```

The function handles numbers by:
1. Returning the number as-is if it's below 1000
2. For larger numbers, finding the appropriate magnitude (thousands, millions, etc.)
3. Rounding to 1 decimal place and checking if the result can be represented within 4 characters
4. Removing the decimal if it's .0 or if including it would exceed 4 characters [end of text]
