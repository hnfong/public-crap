<think>Okay, I need to write a Java program that reads a string from standard input, processes it to extract numbers followed by suffixes like k, K, m, M, etc., converts them to their base values (like kilo is 1024), sums them up, and then outputs the total in K, M, G with one decimal place. Also, handle commas as thousand separators and both uppercase and lowercase suffixes.

First, let's break down the steps. The program needs to:

1. Read input from stdin. So probably using System.in. Maybe read the entire input as a string.

2. Extract all the numbers followed by optional suffixes. The numbers can have commas (like 500,000K) and can be in the form like 1.5G. So the regex pattern needs to capture the number part (including possible commas and decimal points) and the suffix.

Wait, but commas are thousand separators. So maybe first, remove all commas from the string before processing. Or process them as part of the number parsing.

Hmm. So perhaps first, process the input string by removing commas. Or maybe when parsing, ignore commas. Wait, but the numbers could be like 1,500.5K. Wait, but in the example input, there's "500,000K" which becomes 500000K. So commas are thousand separators. So the number part (before the suffix) can have commas, which we need to remove before parsing as a double.

So step 1: process the input string by replacing commas with empty string. Then split into tokens? Or use a regex to find all the patterns that match the numbers followed by optional suffixes.

The regex pattern for the numbers and suffixes. Let's think. The number can be something like:

- 1.5G → the number is 1.5, followed by G.

- 2K → 2 followed by K.

- 3M → 3 followed by M.

- 500,000K → after removing commas, 500000K.

So the regex should capture the number (which can have optional decimal points) and the suffix (case-insensitive). So the pattern would be something like:

([+-]?\d+\.?\d*)([kKmMgG])?

Wait, but the suffix is optional? Wait, the problem says "extracts all numbers followed by optional suffixes". So the suffix is optional? Or is the suffix required? Wait, the example input has entries like "2K," which implies that the suffix is part of the number. So the numbers are followed by suffixes. So the suffix is part of the number. So the pattern is a number (which can have a decimal part) followed by an optional suffix (k, K, m, M, g, G). Wait, no. The suffix is optional? Or is it required? Let me check the problem statement again.

The task says: "extracts all numbers followed by optional suffixes (k, K, m, M, g, G)". So the suffix is optional. Wait, but in the example input, all the numbers have a suffix. So maybe the suffix is optional. But perhaps the numbers without a suffix are considered as bytes (no suffix). But the problem says "followed by optional suffixes", which implies that the suffix is optional. So the regex should capture numbers that may or may not have a suffix.

Wait, but the problem says "extracts all numbers followed by optional suffixes (k, K, m, M, g, G)". So the numbers are followed by optional suffixes. So the suffix is optional. So the regex should match a number (like 1.5) followed by an optional suffix (k, K, etc.), but perhaps the suffix is required? Because in the example input, all entries have a suffix. Hmm. Let me check the example input again.

In the example input, each number is followed by a suffix. So perhaps the suffix is required. Wait, the problem says "optional suffixes". So maybe the suffix can be present or not. But in the example, they are present. So perhaps the code should handle numbers with or without suffixes. For example, a number like 500 would be considered as 500 bytes. But according to the note, the suffixes are k, K, m, M, g, G. So if a number has no suffix, it's treated as bytes (no multiplier). But the problem says "followed by optional suffixes", which implies that the suffix is optional. So the code should process numbers with or without suffixes.

Wait, but the problem says "extracts all numbers followed by optional suffixes (k, K, m, M, g, G)". So the suffix is optional. So the regex should capture numbers that may have a suffix (like 1.5G) or no suffix (like 123). But then, how to handle numbers without suffixes. For example, 123 would be 123 bytes. But the problem says to convert them to their base value. Wait, the base value for k is 1024, m is 1024*1024, etc. So perhaps the suffixes correspond to multipliers. So the code needs to process the suffixes and apply the corresponding multiplier.

So the plan is:

For each token in the input (after processing), extract the number and the suffix. Then convert the number to the base value (like for K, multiply by 1024, for M multiply by 1024^2, etc.). Then sum all these values.

So first, process the input string by removing commas. Then split into tokens? Or use a regex to find all occurrences of numbers followed by optional suffixes.

But the numbers can be in the format like 1.5G, which is a decimal. So the regex pattern needs to capture the number (including possible decimal points) and the suffix (case-insensitive).

So the regex pattern could be something like:

(\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+)([kKmMgG]?) 

But perhaps that's not sufficient. Let's think. The number can be like 1.5, 2, 3.0, .5 (but maybe the input doesn't have leading decimals). But the problem says "numbers", which can have decimal points. So the regex should capture numbers like 1.5, 2, 3.1415, etc.

So the regex pattern for the number part would be something like:

([+-]?(?:\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+)(?:[eE][+-]?\d+)?)

But perhaps the problem doesn't require scientific notation. The example input has numbers like 1.5G, 2K, etc. So maybe the numbers are in the format of decimal numbers (like 1.5) followed by optional suffixes.

So the regex can be:

(\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+)([kKmMgG]?) 

But perhaps we can use a more precise pattern. Let's see. The number can be:

- Integer: 2 → 2

- Decimal with digits before and after: 1.5 → 1.5

- Decimal with only digits after: .5 → .5 (but maybe the input doesn't have this? The example input has 500,000K which becomes 500000K. So perhaps the code should handle numbers with commas, which are stripped first. So first, replace all commas in the input string with empty string. Then process the string to find all the numbers followed by optional suffixes.

So step 1: read the input string, replace commas with empty string. Then process the string to find all the numbers and suffixes.

So the code would first read the input, remove commas, then use a regex to find all matches of the pattern.

So the regex pattern would be:

([+-]?\d+\.?\d*)([kKmMgG]?) 

But perhaps the sign is allowed? The problem says "numbers", but the example input doesn't have negative numbers. The problem statement doesn't mention handling negatives. So perhaps the code can assume that numbers are positive. So the
