<think>Okay, I need to write a Java program that reads a string from standard input, processes it to extract numbers followed by suffixes like k, K, m, M, etc., converts them to their base values (like kilo is 1024), sums them up, and then outputs the total in different units. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the program should read the input. Since it's from standard input, I can use Scanner class. But wait, the input might have commas as thousand separators. Oh right, the note says to handle numbers with commas. So when parsing the numbers, I need to remove commas first. Maybe replace commas with empty strings before parsing as a double.

Next, extracting the numbers and their suffixes. The task says to extract all numbers followed by optional suffixes. So the pattern would be something like a number (which can have decimals) followed by a suffix (k/K/m/M/g/G). But how to capture that in a regular expression?

The regular expression needs to match a number (like \d+\.?\d* or similar) followed by an optional suffix. Let's think: the number can be something like 1.5G, which has a decimal point. So the pattern for the number part should allow optional decimal and fractional digits. Then the suffix is a single character (case-insensitive) from k, m, g. Wait, the suffixes are k (kilo?), m (mega?), g (giga?). Wait, according to the note, the suffixes correspond to kilo=1024, M=1024*1024 (so M is mega?), etc. Wait the note says: k is kilo (1024), M is 1024*1024 (so that's mega?), but the example input has 3M which would be 3*1024^2. Let me check the example:

In the first example input: 3M. The output sum in M is 6928.0. Let's see: 3M would be 3 * 1024^2 = 3*1048576 = 3145728. But in the output, the sum for M is 6928.0. Wait, the first example's output sum is 7264621772.8. Let's see:

The input is 1.5G, 2K, 3M, and 4.2G. Let's compute each:

1.5G: G is gigabytes (assuming here that G is 1024^3). So 1.5 * 1024^3 = 1.5 * 1073741824 = 1610612736.

2K: 2 * 1024 = 2048.

3M: 3 * 1024^2 = 3*1048576 = 3145728.

4.2G: 4.2 * 1024^3 = 4.2 * 1073741824 = 4504315662.48.

Summing these: 1610612736 + 2048 = 1610614784; +3145728 = 1613760512; +4504315662.48 = 6118076174.48? Wait, but the example output is 7264621772.8. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the suffixes. Wait the note says: k is kilo (1024), M is 1024*1024 (so M is mega?), but perhaps the suffixes are:

k/K = 1024^1 (kilo)

m/M = 1024^2 (mega)

g/G = 1024^3 (giga)

Wait, but the note says "kilo=1024, M=1024*1024, etc." So M is 1024 squared. So the suffixes are:

k/K: 1024^1

m/M: 1024^2

g/G: 1024^3

Wait, but that's not the usual. Usually, M is 10^6, but here according to the note, M is 1024*1024. So the suffixes are:

k/K: 1024

m/M: 1024^2

g/G: 1024^3

So the suffix to multiplier mapping would be:

k or K → 1024^1

m or M → 1024^2

g or G → 1024^3

Wait, but the note says "kilo=1024, M=1024*1024, etc." So yes. So the suffixes are:

k/K → 1024^1

m/M → 1024^2

g/G → 1024^3

So for example, 1.5G would be 1.5 * 1024^3 = 1.5 * 1073741824 = 1610612736.

But in the first example input, the sum is 7264621772.8. Let's compute each term:

1.5G → 1.5 * 1024^3 = 1.5 * 1073741824 = 1610612736

2K → 2 * 1024 = 2048

3M → 3 * 1024^2 = 3 * 1048576 = 3145728

4.2G → 4.2 * 1024^3 = 4.2 * 1073741824 = 4504315662.48

Summing these:

1610612736 + 2048 = 1610614784

1610614784 + 3145728 = 1613760512

1613760512 + 4504315662.48 = 6118076174.48? But the example output is 7264621772.8. Wait, that's a discrepancy. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check again.

Wait 1.5G is 1.5 * 1024^3. 1024^3 is 1073741824. 1.5 * 1073741824 = 1610612736.

4.2G is 4.2 * 1073741824 = 4504315662.48.

Adding 1.5G and 4.2G: 1610612736 + 4504315662.48 = 6114928398.48.

Then 2K is 2048, 3M is 3*1048576=3145728. Adding those: 2048 + 3145728 = 3147776
