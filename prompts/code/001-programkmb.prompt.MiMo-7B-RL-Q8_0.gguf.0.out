<think>Okay, I need to write a Java program that reads a string from standard input, processes it to extract numbers followed by suffixes like k, K, m, M, etc., converts them to their base values (like kilo is 1024), sums them up, and then outputs the total in K, M, G with one decimal place. Also, handle commas as thousand separators and both uppercase and lowercase suffixes.

First, let's break down the steps. The program needs to:

1. Read input from stdin. So probably using System.in. Maybe read the entire input as a string.

2. Extract all the numbers followed by optional suffixes. The numbers can have commas (like 500,000K) and can be in the form like 1.5G. So the regex pattern needs to capture the number part (including possible commas and decimal points) and the suffix.

Wait, but commas are thousand separators. So maybe first, remove all commas from the string before processing. Or process them as part of the number parsing.

Hmm. So perhaps first, process the input string by removing commas. Or maybe when parsing, ignore commas. Wait, but the numbers could be like 1,500.5K. Wait, but in the example input, there's "500,000K" which becomes 500000K. So commas are thousand separators. So the number part (before the suffix) can have commas, which we need to remove before parsing as a double.

So step 1: process the input string by replacing commas with empty string. Then split into tokens? Or use a regex to find all the patterns that match the numbers followed by optional suffixes.

The regex pattern for the numbers and suffixes. Let's think. The number can be something like:

- 1.5G → the number is 1.5, followed by G.

- 2K → 2 followed by K.

- 3M → 3 followed by M.

- 500,000K → after removing commas, 500000K.

So the regex should capture the number (which can have optional decimal points) and the suffix (case-insensitive). So the pattern would be something like:

([+-]?\d+\.?\d*)([kKmMgG])?

Wait, but the suffix is optional? Wait, the problem says "extracts all numbers followed by optional suffixes". So the suffix is optional? Or is the suffix required? Wait, the example input has entries like "2K," which implies that the suffix is part of the number. So the numbers are followed by suffixes. So the suffix is part of the number. So the pattern is a number (which can have a decimal part) followed by an optional suffix (k, K, m, M, g, G). Wait, no. The suffix is optional? Or is it required? Let me check the problem statement again.

The task says: "extracts all numbers followed by optional suffixes (k, K, m, M, g, G)". So the suffix is optional. Wait, but in the example input, all the numbers have a suffix. So maybe the suffix is optional. But perhaps the numbers without a suffix are considered as bytes (no suffix). But the problem says "followed by optional suffixes", which implies that the suffix is optional. So the regex should capture numbers that may or may not have a suffix.

Wait, but the problem says "extracts all numbers followed by optional suffixes (k, K, m, M, g, G)". So the numbers are followed by optional suffixes. So the suffix is optional. So the regex should match a number (like 1.5) followed by an optional suffix (k, K, etc.), but perhaps the suffix is required? Because in the example input, all entries have a suffix. Hmm. Let me check the example input again.

In the example input, each number is followed by a suffix. So perhaps the suffix is required. Wait, the problem says "optional suffixes". So maybe the suffix can be present or not. But in the example, they are present. So perhaps the code should handle numbers with or without suffixes. For example, a number like 500 would be considered as 500 bytes. But according to the note, the suffixes are k, K, m, M, g, G. So if a number has no suffix, it's treated as bytes (no multiplier). But the problem says "followed by optional suffixes", which implies that the suffix is optional. So the code should process numbers with or without suffixes.

Wait, but the problem says "extracts all numbers followed by optional suffixes (k, K, m, M, g, G)". So the suffix is optional. So the regex should capture numbers that may have a suffix (like 1.5G) or no suffix (like 123). But then, how to handle numbers without suffixes. For example, 123 would be 123 bytes. But the problem says to convert them to their base value. Wait, the base value for k is 1024, m is 1024*1024, etc. So perhaps the suffixes correspond to multipliers. So the code needs to process the suffixes and apply the corresponding multiplier.

So the plan is:

For each token in the input (after processing), extract the number and the suffix. Then convert the number to the base value (like for K, multiply by 1024, for M multiply by 1024^2, etc.). Then sum all these values.

So first, process the input string by removing commas. Then split into tokens? Or use a regex to find all occurrences of numbers followed by optional suffixes.

But the numbers can be in the format like 1.5G, which is a decimal. So the regex pattern needs to capture the number (including possible decimal points) and the suffix (case-insensitive).

So the regex pattern could be something like:

(\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+)([kKmMgG]?) 

But perhaps that's not sufficient. Let's think. The number can be like 1.5, 2, 3.0, .5 (but maybe the input doesn't have leading decimals). But the problem says "numbers", which can have decimal points. So the regex should capture numbers like 1.5, 2, 3.1415, etc.

So the regex pattern for the number part would be something like:

([+-]?(?:\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+)(?:[eE][+-]?\d+)?)

But perhaps the problem doesn't require scientific notation. The example input has numbers like 1.5G, 2K, etc. So maybe the numbers are in the format of decimal numbers (like 1.5) followed by optional suffixes.

So the regex can be:

(\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+)([kKmMgG]?) 

But perhaps we can use a more precise pattern. Let's see. The number can be:

- Integer: 2 → 2

- Decimal with digits before and after: 1.5 → 1.5

- Decimal with only digits after: .5 → .5 (but maybe the input doesn't have this? The example input has 500,000K which becomes 500000K. So perhaps the code should handle numbers with commas, which are stripped first. So first, replace all commas in the input string with empty string. Then process the string to find all the numbers followed by optional suffixes.

So step 1: read the input string, replace commas with empty string. Then process the string to find all the numbers and suffixes.

So the code would first read the input, remove commas, then use a regex to find all matches of the pattern.

So the regex pattern would be:

([+-]?\d+\.?\d*)([kKmMgG]?) 

But perhaps the sign is allowed? The problem says "numbers", but the example input doesn't have negative numbers. The problem statement doesn't mention handling negatives. So perhaps the code can assume that numbers are positive. So the regex can ignore signs.

So the regex pattern would be:

(\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+)([kKmMgG]?) 

But perhaps the code can use a more precise pattern. Let's think. The number part can be:

- One or more digits followed by an optional decimal point and zero or more digits (e.g., 123, 123.45)

- Or a decimal point followed by one or more digits (e.g., .45)

But the problem's example input includes numbers like 1.5G, 2K, 3M, etc. So the code should handle numbers with decimal points.

So the regex pattern for the number part would be:

([+-]?(?:\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+))

But again, perhaps the code can ignore signs. So the regex can be:

(\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+)([kKmMgG]?) 

But perhaps the code can use a more precise regex. Let's see. Let's use a regex group for the number and the suffix.

So the regex would be:

(?<number>\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+)(?(suffix)[kKmMgG])

Wait, perhaps using a positive lookahead. Alternatively, use a group for the suffix.

So the regex can be written as:

([^\d]+)?((\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+))([kKmMgG]?)?

Wait, perhaps not. Let's think again. The code needs to find all tokens that start with a number (possibly with decimal) followed by an optional suffix (k, K, m, M, g, G). So the regex can be:

(\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+)([kKmMgG]?) 

But this might not capture all cases. For example, if the number is followed by a letter that is not a suffix. But the problem says that the suffix is one of the specified letters. So the regex should match the number followed by an optional suffix (one of k, K, m, M, g, G). So the suffix part is optional. So the regex would capture the number and the suffix if present.

So the code can use a regex pattern like:

(\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+)([kKmMgG]?) 

But perhaps the code should use a case-insensitive flag for the suffix letters. So the suffix can be in any case.

So the regex can be written as:

(\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+)([kKmMgG]?) 

But perhaps the code can use a case-insensitive flag for the suffix letters. Wait, the suffix can be uppercase or lowercase. So the regex should match either. So the suffix part can be [kKmMgG], but perhaps using a case-insensitive flag would make it easier. So the code can use the regex with the case-insensitive flag.

Alternatively, the code can make the suffix letters case-insensitive by using [kKmMgG], but perhaps using a case-insensitive flag would be better. So the code can use:

Pattern.compile("^\\s*(\\d+\.?\d*|\\.\\d+)([kKmMgG]?)\\s*$")

Wait, but perhaps the code should match the entire token. For example, in the input "1.5G, 2K,", after removing commas, it becomes "1.5G  2K". So the code needs to find all occurrences of the number followed by optional suffix, possibly surrounded by whitespace.

So perhaps the regex should match each token, which can be a number followed by an optional suffix. So the code can split the input into tokens, but perhaps using a regex to find all matches of the pattern.

So the code can process the entire input string (after removing commas) and use a regex to find all matches of the pattern:

(\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+)([kKmMgG]?) 

But perhaps the code should also account for possible whitespace between the number and the suffix. For example, "1.5 K" would have a space between the number and the suffix. But the problem's example input shows "1.5G, 2K," which implies that the suffix is directly after the number. So perhaps the code should not consider any whitespace between the number and the suffix. So the regex should match the number followed by the suffix (if present) without any characters in between.

So the code can use a regex that matches the entire token. So the regex would be:

(\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+)([kKmMgG]?) 

But perhaps the code should also skip any non-digit characters after the suffix. For example, if there's a number followed by a suffix and then other characters. But the code is supposed to extract the numbers followed by optional suffixes. So the regex should capture the number and suffix as a whole.

So the code can use a regex that matches the entire token. So perhaps the code can split the input into tokens, but perhaps using a regex to find all occurrences of the pattern.

Alternatively, the code can split the input into tokens by splitting on non-numeric characters, but that might not work. So perhaps the best approach is to use a regex to find all matches of the pattern.

So the code can process the input string (after removing commas) and use a Matcher to find all occurrences of the pattern.

Once the code extracts the number and suffix, it needs to convert the number to a base value. For example, if the suffix is 'G', then the value is the number multiplied by 1024^3 (since G is gigabytes, which is 1024^3 bytes). Wait, the note says: kilo=1024, M=1024*1024, etc. So the multipliers are:

k = 1024

K = same as k? Or perhaps the suffix is case-insensitive. So K is same as k. So the code can process the suffix in a case-insensitive way.

So the suffixes and their multipliers:

k/K → 1024

m/M → 1024 * 1024 = 1,048,576

g/G → 1024^3 = 1,073,741,824

Wait, but the problem says: kilo=1024, M=1024*1024, etc. So:

k or K → 1024

m or M → 1024^2 (1,048,576)

g or G → 1024^3 (1,073,741,824)

Wait, but the problem says "kilo=1024, M=1024*1024, etc." So perhaps the suffixes are:

k/K → 1024 (kilo)

m/M → 1024^2 (mega?)

Wait, but in standard terms, M is often 1,000,000. But the problem specifies that M is 1024*1024. So the code must use the multipliers as per the problem's note.

So the code needs to map the suffixes to their respective multipliers. So:

suffix → multiplier

k → 1024

K → same as k

m → 1024^2

M → same as m

g → 1024^3

G → same as g

So the code can create a map or a switch case that converts the suffix to the multiplier. For example, if the suffix is 'k' or 'K', multiply by 1024. If 'm' or 'M', multiply by 1024*1024. If 'g' or 'G', multiply by 1024^3. If there is no suffix, then the multiplier is 1.

So the code will process each number as follows:

number_part = the parsed number (as a double)

suffix = the matched suffix (case-insensitive)

if suffix is present:

convert number_part * multiplier (based on suffix) to bytes.

Wait, no. Wait, the code needs to convert the number to its base value. For example, 1.5G would be 1.5 * 1024^3 bytes. Because G is 1024^3.

So the code will take the number (as a double) and multiply by the multiplier (based on the suffix). Then sum all these values.

So the steps for each token:

1. Remove commas from the input string.

2. Use regex to find all tokens that match the pattern of a number (with optional decimal) followed by an optional suffix (k, K, m, M, g, G, case-insensitive).

3. For each token:

   a. Extract the number part and the suffix.

   b. Parse the number part as a double.

   c. Determine the multiplier based on the suffix (if any).

   d. Multiply the parsed number by the multiplier to get the value in bytes.

4. Sum all the values.

Once the sum is calculated, the code needs to output the sum as:

- The total sum as is (e.g., 7264621772.8)

- Then the sum converted to kilobytes (K), with one decimal place (e.g., 7094357.2 k)

- Then megabytes (M), e.g., 6928.1 M

- Then gigabytes (G), e.g., 6.8 G

Wait, the example output shows:

7264621772.8

7094357.2 k

6928.1 M

6.8 G

So the total sum is displayed first, then the same sum converted to K, M, G, each with one decimal place.

Wait, but how is the conversion done? Let's see:

The total sum is in bytes. So to convert to kilobytes (K), divide by 1024. To megabytes (M), divide by 1024^2. To gigabytes (G), divide by 1024^3.

But the example input's output:

The first line is 7264621772.8 bytes.

Then, converting to K: 7264621772.8 / 1024 = 7094357.2 (exactly as in the example). Then to M: 7094357.2 / 1024 = 6928.1 (approximate). Wait, wait:

Wait, 7264621772.8 bytes divided by 1024 is 7094357.2 K (since 1K = 1024 bytes). Then 7094357.2 K is 7094357.2 / 1024 = 6928.1 M. Then 6928.1 M / 1024 = 6.765... G, which rounds to 6.8 G.

So the code needs to take the total sum (in bytes) and convert it to K, M, G by dividing by 1024, 1024^2, 1024^3 respectively, each time, and format each to one decimal place.

So the code's steps after summing:

- Compute the total sum in bytes.

- Then, for K: sum_bytes / 1024.0 → format to one decimal.

- For M: sum_bytes / (1024 * 1024) → format to one decimal.

- For G: sum_bytes / (1024 * 1024 * 1024) → format to one decimal.

But wait, the example output shows that the sum in K is 7094357.2, which is 7264621772.8 / 1024 = 7094357.2 exactly. Then M is 7094357.2 / 1024 = 6928.1 (exactly). Then G is 6928.1 / 1024 = 6.765... which rounds to 6.8.

So the code must format each value to one decimal place, even if the decimal is zero. For example, if the value is an integer, it should show .0.

So the code needs to format each of the K, M, G values to one decimal place.

Now, the code structure:

Read input from stdin. Process:

1. Read the entire input as a string.

2. Remove all commas from the string.

3. Use a regex to find all tokens that match the pattern of a number followed by optional suffix.

4. For each token:

   a. Split into number part and suffix (if any).

   b. Parse the number part as a double.

   c. Determine the multiplier based on the suffix.

   d. Add (number * multiplier) to the sum.

Once all tokens are processed, compute the sum in bytes. Then compute the sum in K, M, G.

Then output:

- The sum as is (bytes? Or the sum after processing? Wait, the example's first line is 7264621772.8. Let's see:

Looking at the example input:

1.5G, 2K, 3M, 500,000K, 600M.

Processing each:

1.5G → 1.5 * 1024^3 = 1.5 * 1073741824 = 1610612736

2K → 2 * 1024 = 2048

3M → 3 * 1024^2 = 3 * 1048576 = 3145728

500,000K → 500000 * 1024 = 512000000

600M → 600 * 1024^2 = 600 * 1048576 = 629145600

Summing these:

1610612736 + 2048 = 1610614784

+3145728 → 1610614784 + 3,145,728 = 161,093,0512? Wait, let's compute step by step:

1.5G: 1.5 * 1024^3 = 1.5 * 1073741824 = 1,610,612,736 bytes.

2K: 2 * 1024 = 2048 bytes.

3M: 3 * 1024^2 = 3 * 1,048,576 = 3,145,728 bytes.

500,000K: 500,000 * 1024 = 512,000,000 bytes.

600M: 600 * 1,048,576 = 629,145,600 bytes.

Adding all together:

1,610,612,736 + 2,048 = 1,610,614,784

+3,145,728 → 1,613,760,512

+512,000,000 → 2,125,760,512

+629,145,600 → 2,754,906,112 bytes?

Wait, but the example output's first line is 7264621772.8. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps the example input is:

The input is:

1.5G, 2K,

3M, and 4.2G

500,000K and 600M

So let's process each token:

First line: "1.5G, 2K," → after removing commas: "1.5G 2K"

Tokens: "1.5G", "2K".

1.5G → 1.5 * 1024^3 = 1.5 * 1073741824 = 1,610,612,736 bytes.

2K → 2 * 1024 = 2048 bytes. Sum so far: 1,610,614,784.

Second line: "3M, and 4.2G" → after removing commas: "3M and 4.2G". Tokens: "3M", "4.2G".

3M → 3 * 1024^2 = 3 * 1,048,576 = 3,145,728 bytes. Sum becomes 1,613,760,512.

4.2G → 4.2 * 1024^3 = 4.2 * 1,073,741,824 = let's compute that: 4 * 1,073,741,824 = 4,294,967,296; 0.2 * 1,073,741,824 = 214,748,364.8 → total 4,509,715,660.8 bytes. Sum becomes 1,613,760,512 + 4,509,715,660.8 = 6,123,476,172.8 bytes.

Third line: "500,000K and 600M" → after removing commas: "500000K 600M". Tokens: "500000K", "600M".

500000K → 500,000 * 1024 = 512,000,000 bytes. Sum becomes 6,123,476,172.8 + 512,000,000 = 6,635,476,172.8.

600M → 600 * 1,048,576 = 629,145,600 bytes. Sum becomes 6,635,476,172.8 + 629,145,600 = 7,264,621,772.8 bytes. Which matches the example's first line output of 7264621772.8 (note the decimal point is after 7264621772.8).

So the code's sum is correct.

Now, the code needs to process each token correctly.

So the code steps:

Read input, remove commas.

Use a regex to find all tokens that match the pattern of a number followed by optional suffix.

The regex pattern for each token would be:

The number part can be:

- digits followed by optional . and digits (e.g., 123, 123.45, .45?)

But the problem's example doesn't have .45, but perhaps the code should handle it.

So the regex pattern for the number part is:

([+-]?(?:\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+))

But since the problem says numbers can have commas (which are stripped), and the code has already removed commas, the code can process the remaining string.

So the regex pattern can be:

(\d+\.?\d*|\.\d+)([kKmMgG]?) 

But perhaps the code can use a case-insensitive flag for the suffix letters.

So the code can use:

Pattern.compile("(\\d+\.?\d*|\\.\\d+)([kKmMgG]?)")

But perhaps the code should also ignore any whitespace between the number and the suffix. For example, "1.5 K" would have a space. But the problem's example input doesn't have that. So perhaps the code should assume that the suffix is directly after the number. So the regex would match the number followed by the suffix (if present) with no characters in between.

So the code can use the regex to find all matches of the pattern.

Once the code extracts the number and suffix, it can process them.

So the code can use a Matcher to loop through all matches. For each match:

Group 1 is the number part, group 2 is the suffix (could be empty).

So for each match:

double number = Double.parseDouble(group1);

String suffix = group2;

Then determine the multiplier based on the suffix.

So the code can have a helper method to get the multiplier for a suffix.

For example:

private static double getMultiplier(String suffix) {
    switch (suffix.toLowerCase()) {
        case "k":
        case "kilo":
            return 1024.0;
        case "m":
        case "mega":
            return 1024.0 * 1024.0;
        case "g":
        case "giga":
            return 1024.0 * 1024.0 * 1024.0;
        default:
            return 1.0;
    }
}

Wait, but according to the problem's note, the suffixes are k, K, m, M, g, G. So the code can check for 'k', 'm', 'g' (case-insensitive). So:

if suffix is 'k' or 'K', multiplier is 1024.

if suffix is 'm' or 'M', multiplier is 1024^2.

if suffix is 'g' or 'G', multiplier is 1024^3.

Else, multiplier is 1.

So code:

private static double getMultiplier(String suffix) {
    suffix = suffix.toLowerCase();
    if (suffix.equals("k")) {
        return 1024.0;
    } else if (suffix.equals("m")) {
        return 1024.0 * 1024.0;
    } else if (suffix.equals("g")) {
        return 1024.0 * 1024.0 * 1024.0;
    } else {
        return 1.0;
    }
}

Wait, but the problem says the suffix can be k, K, m, M, g, G. So the code converts the suffix to lowercase and checks for 'k', 'm', 'g'.

So for example, if the suffix is 'K', it becomes 'k', which is handled.

So the code can proceed.

Now, the code steps:

Read input from stdin. So in Java, using:

BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

String input = reader.lines().collect(Collectors.joining("\n"));

Then, remove commas:

String cleaned = input.replaceAll(",*", "").trim(); // Wait, replace all commas with empty string. So input.replaceAll(",", "");

Wait, yes. So:

cleaned = input.replaceAll(",", "").trim();

Wait, but maybe leading/trailing spaces. So after replacing commas, trim the string.

Then, use a regex to find all matches of the pattern.

So:

Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("(\\d+\.?\d*|\\.\\d+)([kKmMgG]?)");

Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(cleaned);

Then, for each match:

double sum = 0;

while (matcher.find()) {

    String numberStr = matcher.group(1);

    String suffix = matcher.group(2);

    double number = Double.parseDouble(numberStr);

    double multiplier = getMultiplier(suffix);

    sum += number * multiplier;

}

Wait, but what about cases where the number is like .5 (0.5)? The regex allows that. So the code can parse it as 0.5.

But what about leading zeros? The code doesn't care, as it's parsed as a double.

Once the sum is calculated, then compute the values in K, M, G.

Then, output the sum (as is?), then the sum converted to K (sum / 1024), formatted to one decimal place.

Wait, the example's first line is 7264621772.8, which is the sum in bytes. So the code outputs the sum as is (bytes), then the sum converted to K (sum / 1024), formatted to one decimal place, then M (sum / (1024*1024)), formatted to one decimal, then G (sum / (1024^3)), formatted to one decimal.

So code:

double sumBytes = sum;

// Output sumBytes with one decimal place? Or as is?

Wait, the example's first line is 7264621772.8, which has one decimal. So the code needs to output the sum as a double with one decimal place.

But wait, the sum is calculated as a double (since the code parses the numbers as doubles and multiplies by multipliers which can be 1024.0, etc.). So sum is a double. So when outputting, format it to have one decimal place.

So:

System.out.printf("%.1f\n", sumBytes);

Then, compute the values for K, M, G.

double k = sumBytes / 1024.0;

double m = sumBytes / (1024.0 * 1024.0);

double g = sumBytes / (1024.0 * 1024.0 * 1024.0);

Then, format each to one decimal place.

So:

System.out.printf("%.1f k\n", k);

System.out.printf("%.1f M\n", m);

System.out.printf("%.1f G\n", g);

Wait, but in the example output, the K line is "7094357.2 k", which is sumBytes / 1024.0 = 7264621772.8 / 1024 = 7094357.2 (exactly). Then M is 7094357.2 / 1024 = 6928.1 (exactly). G is 6928.1 / 1024 = 6.765... which rounds to 6.8.

So the code must use the same sum for all calculations. So the code should compute the sum in bytes, then compute K, M, G from that sum.

So the code steps:

sum is the total in bytes.

k = sum / 1024.0 → K.

m = sum / (1024 * 1024) → M.

g = sum / (1024 * 1024 * 1024) → G.

Then, format each to one decimal place.

Now, code structure:

Read input, process, sum, output.

Now, code:

import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
import java.util.regex.Matcher;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        // Read input
        StringBuilder input = new StringBuilder();
        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
                input.append(line);
            }
        }
        // Remove commas
        String cleaned = input.toString().replace(',', '').trim();
        // Compile the regex pattern
        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile("(\\d+\.?\d*|\\.\\d+)([kKmMgG]?)");
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(cleaned);
        double sum = 0.0;
        while (matcher.find()) {
            String numberStr = matcher.group(1);
            String suffix = matcher.group(2);
            double number = Double.parseDouble(numberStr);
            double multiplier = 1.0;
            // Determine multiplier based on suffix
            suffix = suffix.toLowerCase();
            if (suffix.equals("k")) {
                multiplier = 1024.0;
            } else if (suffix.equals("m")) {
                multiplier = 1024.0 * 1024.0;
            } else if (suffix.equals("g")) {
                multiplier = 1024.0 * 1024.0 * 1024.0;
            }
            sum += number * multiplier;
        }
        // Output the results
        System.out.printf("%.1f\n", sum);
        double k = sum / 1024.0;
        System.out.printf("%.1f k\n", k);
        double m = sum / (1024.0 * 1024.0);
        System.out.printf("%.1f M\n", m);
        double g = sum / (1024.0 * 1024.0 * 1024.0);
        System.out.printf("%.1f G\n", g);
    }
}

Wait, but in the code above, the suffix is matched as group 2. So for example, in "1.5G", group 1 is "1.5", group 2 is "G". Then, suffix is converted to lowercase, so "g", and multiplier is 1024^3.

Yes.

Testing the example input:

Input after removing commas is "1.5G 2K 3M 4.2G 500000K 600M".

Processing each token:

1.5G → group1: "1.5", group2: "G" → suffix is "g" → multiplier 1024^3 → 1.5 * 1024^3 = 1,610,612,736.

2K → group1: "2", group2: "K" → suffix "k" → multiplier 1024 → 2*1024=2048.

3M → group1: "3", group2: "M" → suffix "m" → multiplier 1024^2 → 3*1024^2=3,145,728.

4.2G → group1: "4.2", group2: "G" → suffix "g" → multiplier 1024^3 → 4.2 * 1024^3 = 4,509,715,660.8.

500000K → group1: "500000", group2: "K" → suffix "k" → multiplier 1024 → 500000 * 1024 = 512,000,000.

600M → group1: "600", group2: "M" → suffix "m" → multiplier 1024^2 → 600 * 1024^2 = 629,145,600.

Summing all these gives 1,610,612,736 + 2048 = 1,610,614,784 + 3,145,728 = 1,613,760,512 + 4,509,715,660.8 = 6,123,476,172.8 + 512,000,000 = 6,635,476
