Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

You're right to be cautious! This program has a potential issue. 

Here's why:

* **`math.inf` (infinity):**  The `while` loop condition `x < math.inf` will never be false because `math.inf` represents positive infinity.  No matter how large `x` gets, it will always be less than infinity.

* **Infinite Loop:** This means the loop will run forever, continuously adding `inc` to `x`.  The program will never reach the `print("Done")` statement.

**Examples of Inputs:**

Any number you enter for `inc` will result in an infinite loop. Here are two examples:

1. **`inc = 1.0`:**  `x` will keep increasing by 1, never reaching a point where it's no longer less than infinity.
2. **`inc = 0.1`:**  `x` will increase by 0.1 each time, still never reaching a point where it's no longer less than infinity.


**To fix this program, you'd need to:**

* **Set a finite limit:** Instead of comparing `x` to infinity, compare it to a specific, finite number. For example:

   ```python
   import math
   x = 0.0
   inc = float(input("Enter a number: "))
   limit = 100.0  # Or any other desired limit
   while x < limit:
       x += inc
   print("Done")
   ```
