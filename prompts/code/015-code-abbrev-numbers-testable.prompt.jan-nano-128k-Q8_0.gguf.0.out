Okay, I need to write a Python function called abbrev_num that takes an integer and returns a string representing it in a compact, human-readable form. The examples given are like 2 becomes "2", 8180 becomes "8.2K", and 9385832 becomes "9.4M". But the output string should be <=4 characters. So for 74581, it's "75K" instead of "74.5K" because that's 5 characters. 

First, I need to figure out how to determine the appropriate unit (K, M, G, etc.) and then format the number accordingly. Let's think about the steps.

The key is to find the largest unit that's appropriate for the number. For example, if the number is less than 1000, it's just the number. If it's between 1000 and 999,999, it's in thousands (K), and so on.

So the units are K (10^3), M (10^6), G (10^9), T (10^12), etc. But since the output needs to be up to 4 characters, maybe we need to check for each possible unit and see which one is the right one.

Let me think about the possible ranges:

- 0-999: just the number as a string.
- 1000-999,999: K, but need to round to two significant digits. Wait, but the example for 8180 is 8.2K. Wait, 8180 is 8.18K, which rounds to 8.2K. But 8180 is 8.18K, which is 8.18 thousand. So the function is supposed to round to the nearest hundred, maybe? Or to two significant digits?

Wait, the problem says "a couple significant digits" and "order of magnitude". So for numbers in the thousands, maybe we need to round to two significant digits. For example, 8180 is 8.18K, which would be rounded to 8.2K. But for numbers like 74581, which is 74.581K, but since the output must be <=4 characters, we can't have 74.5K (which is 5 characters). So instead, we need to round to two digits, but maybe that's not possible. Wait, 74581 is 74.581K. If we round to two significant digits, that would be 75K. Because 74.581 rounded to two significant digits is 75. So that's why the example says "75K".

So the approach is: for each number, find the appropriate unit (K, M, G, etc.), then divide the number by that unit's value, round to two significant digits, and then format the string with the unit.

But how to determine the unit? Let's think about the thresholds. For example:

- K is 10^3. So if the number is >= 1000, then we check if it's >= 10^6 (M) or not. Wait, but maybe we need to find the largest unit that's less than or equal to the number. Wait, no. For example, 9385832 is 9.385832 million, which is 9.4M when rounded to two significant digits. So the unit is determined by the highest power of 1000 that is less than or equal to the number.

Wait, but how to find that. Let's think of the possible units:

The units are K (10^3), M (10^6), G (10^9), T (10^12), etc. So for a number x, we can check which of these units is the appropriate one.

But perhaps the way to do this is to find the exponent of 1000 that is the largest such that 1000^exponent <= x. Then divide x by 1000^exponent and round to two significant digits.

But how to compute that exponent. Let's think of the steps:

For example, for x=8180:

x is 8180. Let's see:

1000^0 = 1 (so x is 8180, which is more than 1000^1 (1000) but less than 1000^2 (1,000,000). So the exponent is 1. Then divide by 1000^1 (1000) to get 8.18, then round to two significant digits. So 8.2, then append "K".

But for x=74581, which is 74.581 K. So the exponent is 1 (since 1000^1 is 1000, and 74581 is less than 1000^2 (1,000,000). So divide by 1000^1 (1000) to get 74.581. Then round to two significant digits. Wait, but 74.581 rounded to two significant digits is 75. So that's why the output is "75K".

But how to compute the exponent. Let's think of the possible exponents. Let's see:

We can start by checking if x is >= 1e6 (1,000,000) then use M. If it's >= 1e3 (1000) then use K. But for numbers less than 1e3, use nothing.

Wait, but for numbers like 1000, it's exactly 1K. So the function would return "1K".

But how to find the correct exponent. Let's think of the possible exponents as 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. For each exponent, the unit is 1000^exponent. So for example:

exponent 0: unit is 1 (no suffix)
exponent 1: K
exponent 2: M
exponent 3: G
exponent 4: T
and so on.

But the problem is that for numbers like 1000, the exponent is 1, but for numbers like 1000000, exponent is 2.

So the steps would be:

1. Determine the exponent (n) such that 1000^n <= x < 1000^(n+1). But wait, that's not exactly correct. Because for example, 1000^1 is 1000, and 1000^2 is 1,000,000. So if x is 1000, then n is 1. If x is 1,000,000, then n is 2. But if x is 999,999, then n is 1 (since 1000^1 is 1000, and 999,999 is less than 1000^2 (1,000,000). Wait, no. Wait 1000^1 is 1000, 1000^2 is 1,000,000. So for x=999,999, it's between 1000^1 and 1000^2. So the exponent is 1, but the value is 999.999 K. So the function would round that to two significant digits. But 999.999 is 1000 when rounded to two significant digits? Wait, no. Wait, 999.999 is 999.999, which is 999.999. If we round to two significant digits, that would be 1000. But that would be 1000 K, which is 1M. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, the problem says that the output should be a string that represents the number with a couple significant digits and the order of magnitude. So for example, 9385832 is 9.385832 million, which is 9.4M. So the idea is that the number is divided by the appropriate unit (like 1000^exponent) and then rounded to two significant digits. But the unit is chosen such that the value is in the range of 1 to 999.999... So for example, if the number is 1,000,000, then it's 1M. If it's 999,999, then it's 999.999 K, which would be rounded to 1000 K, but that's 1M. Wait, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe the exponent is determined by the highest power of 1000 that is less than or equal to the number. So for 999,999, the exponent is 1 (since 1000^1 is 1000, but 999,999 is less than that. Wait, no. Wait 1000^1 is 1000. So 999,999 is less than 1000^1? No, 999,999 is 999.999 thousand, which is less than 1000^1 (1000). So the exponent is 1, but the value is 999.999. So when we round to two significant digits, that would be 1000. So the output would be "1000K", but that's 5 characters. Wait, but that's not allowed. So maybe the exponent is determined by the highest power of 1000 that is less than or equal to the number. Wait, but that's not correct. Because for 999,999, the highest power of 1000 less than or equal to it is 1000^1 (1000) is 1000, but 999,999 is less than that. So the exponent would be 0? Wait, no. Because 1000^0 is 1. So that's not right.

Wait, maybe the exponent is determined by the largest n where 1000^n <= x. So for x=999,999, 1000^1 is 1000, which is larger than x. So the largest n is 0. But that would mean that the number is 999,999, which is 999.999 K. But that's not correct. Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the order of magnitude. For example, 1000 is 10^3, which is 1K. 1000000 is 10^6, which is 1M. So the exponent is the number of times you can divide by 1000 before the number is less than 1000. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Another approach: For the number x, find the largest exponent n such that x >= 1000^n. Then divide x by 1000^n, and round to two significant digits. But then, for example, if x is 999,999, then 1000^1 is 1000, which is less than 999,999? No, 1000^1 is 1000, which is less than 999,999? No, 999,999 is 999.999 thousand, which is 999.999 * 1000. So 1000^1 is 1000, which is less than 999,999? No, 1000^1 is 1000, which is less than 999,999? Wait, 999,999 is 999,999, which is larger than 1000. So the largest n where 1000^n <= x is 1, because 1000^1 is 1000, which is less than 999,999. Wait, no. Wait 1000^1 is 1000, which is less than 999,999. So the largest n is 1? Because 1000^2 is 1,000,000, which is larger than 999,999. So for x=999,999, the exponent is 1. Then x divided by 1000^1 is 999.999, which is 999.999 K. But when we round to two significant digits, that would be 1000 K, which is 1M. But that's not correct. Wait, but maybe the way to do it is to round to two significant digits, but if the value is 1000, then it's 1K, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe the problem is that the exponent is determined by the order of magnitude. For example, 1000 is 1K, 1000000 is 1M, 1000000000 is 1G, etc. So for numbers between 1000 and 999,999, the exponent is 1 (K). For numbers between 1,000,000 and 999,999,999, exponent is 2 (M). And so on.

But how to find the exponent. Let's think of the possible thresholds:

- If x < 1000: exponent is 0, no suffix.
- If x >= 1000 and x < 1,000,000: exponent is 1, suffix K.
- If x >= 1,000,000 and x < 1,000,000,000: exponent is 2, suffix M.
- If x >= 1,000,000,000 and x < 1,000,000,000,000: exponent is 3, suffix G.
- etc.

So for x=999,999, it's in the 1000^1 (1000) to 1000^2 (1,000,000) range. So exponent is 1, and the value is 999.999. So when we round to two significant digits, that would be 1000. So the output would be "1000K", but that's 5 characters. But according to the problem statement, the output should be <=4 characters. So that's a problem. Wait, but maybe the problem says that the output should be up to 4 characters, but in that case, how to handle numbers that would require more than 4 characters?

Wait, the example given for 74581 is "75K" which is 3 characters (75K). So for numbers that are in the K range, we need to round to two significant digits, but that would be two digits before the decimal point. Wait, but 74581 is 74.581 K. So if we round to two significant digits, that's 75 K. So the output is "75K".

But for 999,999, which is 999.999 K, rounding to two significant digits would be 1000 K, which is 1000K. But that's 5 characters. So that's not allowed. So perhaps the function should round to one significant digit if the number is in the K range, but that's not the case. Wait, the example for 8180 is 8.2K, which is two significant digits. So maybe the rule is that for numbers in the K range (1000^1), we can have two digits before the decimal point, but if that's more than 4 characters, then we need to adjust.

Wait, but the output must be <=4 characters. So for example, if the value after division is 1000, then the output would be "1K" (if we round to one significant digit) but that's not correct. Wait, no. Wait 1000 is 1K, but that's 1K. But if the value is 1000, then the number is exactly 1000, which is 1K. But if the value is 1000, then the string is "1K", which is 3 characters. So that's okay.

But for 999,999, the value is 999.999 K. So if we round to two significant digits, that would be 1000 K, which is 1K. But that's not correct. Wait, but 999.999 K is 999,999, which is 999.999 K. But if we round to two significant digits, that would be 1000 K, which is 1M. Wait, but that's not possible. Because 1000 K is 1,000,000, which is 1M. So perhaps the function should round to the nearest unit, but if the value is 1000, then it's 1M. So maybe the way to handle this is to check if the value after division is >= 1000, then we need to adjust the exponent again. Wait, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the function should round to two significant digits, but if the value is 1000 or more, then we need to use the next higher unit. Wait, but that's not possible. For example, if the value is 1000, then it's 1000 K, which is 1M. So perhaps the correct approach is to find the exponent such that the value after division is between 1 and 999.999... So that the value is in the range of 1 to 999.999... So that when we round to two significant digits, the string is 2 digits plus the unit, which would be 3 characters (like 75K). But if the value is 1000, then that would be 1000 K, which is 1M. So how do we handle that?

Wait, maybe the exponent is determined by the largest n where 1000^n <= x. Then, the value is x / 1000^n. Then, we need to round that value to two significant digits, but if the value is 1000, then we need to adjust the exponent again. Wait, but that's not possible. Because if x is 1,000,000, then 1000^2 is 1,000,000, so the value is 1, which is 1M. So the exponent is 2, and the value is 1. So the output is "1M".

But for x=999,999, the exponent is 1 (since 1000^1 is 1000, which is less than 999,999? No, 1000^1 is 1000, which is less than 999,999? Wait, 999,999 is 999,999, which is larger than 1000. So the exponent is 1, and the value is 999.999. So when we round to two significant digits, that would be 1000. So the value is 1000, which is 1000 K. But that's 1000 K, which is 1M. So perhaps the function should check if the value after division is >= 1000, then increase the exponent by 1 and adjust the value accordingly. But that seems like a recursive problem.

Alternatively, maybe the correct way is to find the exponent such that the value is in the range [1, 1000). So for example, for x=999,999, the exponent is 1, and the value is 999.999. So that's in the range [1, 1000). So then, we can round to two significant digits. But 999.999 rounded to two significant digits is 1000. So that would be 1000 K, which is 1M. But that's not correct. Wait, but 1000 K is 1,000,000, which is 1M. So if the value is 1000, then the exponent is 1, but the value is 1000, which is 1000 K. But that's 1M. So perhaps the function should not round to two significant digits if that would result in a value that is 1000 or more. Wait, but how to handle that.

Alternatively, maybe the function should round to two significant digits, but if the value is 1000 or more, then we need to adjust the exponent. But that's not straightforward.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find the exponent as the floor of log10(x) divided by 3. Because each exponent is a power of 1000, which is 10^3. So log10(x) / 3 gives the exponent. For example, x=8180: log10(8180) is about 3.912, divided by 3 is 1.304, so floor is 1. So exponent is 1. Then, the value is x / 1000^1 = 8.18, which is rounded to two significant digits as 8.2, then append K.

For x=74581: log10(74581) is about 4.872, divided by 3 is 1.624, floor is 1. So exponent is 1. Value is 74.581, rounded to two significant digits is 75, so "75K".

For x=999,999: log10(999999) is about 5.999999, divided by 3 is 1.999999, floor is 1. So exponent is 1. Value is 999.999, which is 999.999. Rounded to two significant digits is 1000. So the string would be "1000K", which is 5 characters. But that's not allowed. So how to handle that?

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the output should be <=4 characters. So in this case, "1000K" is 5 characters. So that's not acceptable. Therefore, perhaps the function should round to one significant digit if the value is 1000 or more. Wait, but that's not the case. For example, 9385832 is 9.385832 M, which is rounded to 9.4M. That's two significant digits. But 999,999 is 999.999 K, which is 999.999. If we round to two significant digits, that's 1000 K, which is 1M. So perhaps the function should check if the value after division is >= 1000, then adjust the exponent and the value accordingly.

But how to do that. Let me think of the steps again.

Let me think of the possible units and their thresholds:

- K: 1000^1 = 1000
- M: 1000^2 = 1,000,000
- G: 1000^3 = 1,000,000,000
- T: 1000^4 = 1,000,000,000,000
- etc.

So for x=999,999, the value is 999.999 K. But that's 999.999, which is 999.999. If we round to two significant digits, that's 1000. So the output would be "1000K", which is 5 characters. But that's not allowed. So perhaps the function should round to one significant digit if the value is 1000 or more. Wait, but that would be 1000 K, which is 1M. So maybe the function should check if the value is >= 1000, then increase the exponent by 1 and divide by 1000 again. But that's not possible. Because if the value is 1000, then the exponent is 1, but the value is 1000, which is 1000 K. But that's 1M. So perhaps the correct way is to find the exponent such that the value is between 1 and 1000, and then round to two significant digits. But how?

Alternatively, maybe the function should round to two significant digits, but if the value is 1000 or more, then it's represented as 1000 K, which is 1M. But that's not possible. So perhaps the function should not round to two significant digits in that case. Wait, but how to determine that.

Alternatively, maybe the function should round to two significant digits, but if the value is 1000 or more, then the unit is adjusted. For example, if the value is 1000, then it's 1000 K, which is 1M. So the function would need to check if the value is >= 1000, then adjust the exponent and the value again.

But that seems complicated. Let me think of the example where x is 999,999. The value is 999.999 K. So if we round to two significant digits, that's 1000 K. But that's 1000 K, which is 1M. So the function should output "1M" instead of "1000K". But how to detect that.

So perhaps the correct approach is to find the exponent n such that 1000^n <= x < 1000^(n+1). Then, the value is x / 1000^n. Then, we need to round this value to two significant digits, but if the value is 1000 or more, then we need to increase the exponent by 1 and adjust the value again.

Wait, but that's not possible. Because if x is 999,999, then 1000^1 is 1000, which is less than x. So the exponent is 1. Then, the value is 999.999. So if we round that to two significant digits, it's 1000. So then, the value is 1000, which is 1000 K. But that's 1,000,000, which is 1M. So the function should then check if the value is >= 1000, and if so, then the exponent is increased by 1, and the value is divided by 1000 again. But that would be a loop.

Alternatively, maybe the function should round to two significant digits, but if the value is 1000 or more, then the unit is adjusted. But how to do that.

Alternatively, perhaps the function should round to two significant digits, but then if the value is 1000 or more, then the unit is adjusted. For example, if the value is 1000, then it's 1000 K, which is 1M. So the function would need to check if the value is >= 1000, then the unit is adjusted.

But how to implement that. Let me think of the steps again.

Let me think of the possible exponents. For example, for x=999,999, the exponent is 1. The value is 999.999. Rounded to two significant digits is 1000. So the value is 1000, which is 1000 K. But that's 1,000,000, which is 1M. So the function should then check if the value is >= 1000, and if so, then the exponent is increased by 1, and the value is divided by 1000 again. But that would be a problem because the value is 1000, which is 1000 K. So the exponent is 1, but the value is 1000. So the function would then check if the value is >= 1000, which it is, so the exponent becomes 2, and the value is 1000 / 1000^1 = 1. So the output is "1M".

But how to do that in code. So the steps would be:

1. Find the exponent n such that 1000^n <= x < 1000^(n+1). But how to find that.

Alternatively, find the exponent as the floor of log10(x) / 3. For example, log10(999,999) is 5.999999, divided by 3 is 1.999999, floor is 1. So exponent is 1. Then, the value is x / 1000^1 = 999.999. Then, round to two significant digits. If the rounded value is >= 1000, then we need to increase the exponent by 1 and divide by 1000 again.

But how to do that in code. Let's think of the code steps.

First, find the exponent n. For example, for x=999,999, n is 1. Then, value = x / 1000^n. Then, round to two significant digits. If the rounded value is >= 1000, then we need to adjust n to n+1, and value is rounded value / 1000^(n+1). Wait, but that's not correct. Because if the value is 1000, then the exponent is 1, but the value is 1000. So the correct unit is M (1000^2). So the value is 1000 / 1000^1 = 1000, which is 1000 K. But that's 1M. So the function would need to check if the value is >= 1000, then adjust the exponent.

But how to do that. Maybe the code can be:

Compute the value after dividing by 1000^n, then round to two significant digits. Then, check if the rounded value is >= 1000. If yes, then the exponent is increased by 1, and the value is divided by 1000 again. But that would be a loop.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to round to two significant digits, but then if the value is 1000 or more, then the unit is adjusted. But how to do that.

Alternatively, maybe the function should round to two significant digits, but then if the value is 1000 or more, then the unit is adjusted. For example, if the value is 1000, then the unit is M, and the value is 1. So the output is "1M".

But how to find that. Let me think of the code steps.

Let me think of the possible units as a list. For example, units = ['K', 'M', 'G', 'T', ...], and the corresponding divisor is 1000^1, 1000^2, etc.

So for x, we can find the largest n where 1000^n <= x. Then, the value is x / 1000^n. Then, we need to round this value to two significant digits. But if the value is 1000 or more, then we need to adjust n to n+1, and the value is x / 1000^(n+1). But that's not possible because the original x is less than 1000^(n+1). Wait, but if x is 999,999, then n is 1, and the value is 999.999. Rounded to two significant digits is 1000. So then, the value is 1000, which is 1000 K. But that's 1,000,000, which is 1M. So the correct exponent is 2, and the value is 1. So the output is "1M".

So the code would need to check if the rounded value is >= 1000, then adjust the exponent.

But how to do that. Let me think of the code steps.

First, find the exponent n. Then, compute the value as x / 1000^n. Then, round to two significant digits. Then, check if the rounded value is >= 1000. If yes, then n is increased by 1, and the value is rounded value / 1000^(n+1). Wait, but that would be a problem. Because if the original x is 999,999, then after dividing by 1000^1, the value is 999.999. Rounded to two significant digits is 1000. Then, since 1000 is >= 1000, we increase n by 1 (so n becomes 2), and the value is 1000 / 1000^2 = 1000 / 1,000,000 = 0.001. Wait, that's not correct. Wait, no. Wait, if the original x is 999,999, then after dividing by 1000^1, the value is 999.999. Rounded to two significant digits is 1000. Then, the exponent is 2, and the value is 1000 / 1000^1 = 1000. Wait, no. Wait, the exponent is 2, so the divisor is 1000^2 = 1,000,000. So the value is 999,999 / 1,000,000 = 0.999999. Which is 0.999999, which would be rounded to 1.0, so the output is "1M".

But how to compute that. So the code would need to:

- Find the correct exponent n, then compute the value, round it to two significant digits, then check if the rounded value is >= 1000. If yes, then n is increased by 1, and the value is rounded value / 1000^(n+1). Wait, but that's not correct. Because the original x is 999,999, which is 999.999 K. Rounded to two significant digits is 1000 K. But that's 1,000,000, which is 1M. So the code would need to check if the rounded value is >= 1000, then adjust the exponent.

But how to do that in code. Let me think of the steps again.

Let me think of the code:

def abbrev_num(x):
    if x < 1000:
        return str(x)
    # find the exponent n
    n = 0
    while 1000**(n+1) <= x:
        n +=1
    # now, n is the largest exponent where 1000^n <= x
    # but wait, for example, x=999,999, 1000^1 is 1000, 1000^2 is 1,000,000. So 1000^2 is 1,000,000 which is larger than x. So the loop would stop at n=1. So the divisor is 1000^n = 1000^1 = 1000. So the value is x / 1000 = 999.999.

    # then, round to two significant digits. So how to do that.

    value = x / (1000 ** n)
    rounded_value = round(value, 2) ? No, that's not right. Because for example, 8180 / 1000 is 8.18, which is rounded to 8.2. But how to round to two significant digits.

Wait, rounding to two significant digits is different from rounding to two decimal places. For example, 8.18 rounded to two significant digits is 8.2. 74.581 rounded to two significant digits is 75. 999.999 rounded to two significant digits is 1000. So how to do that in Python.

The way to round to two significant digits is to use the round function with a certain number of decimal places, but that depends on the value. For example, if the value is 8.18, then two significant digits would be 8.2. If the value is 74.581, then two significant digits is 75. If the value is 1000, then two significant digits is 1000, but that's 4 characters. But the problem says that the output should be <=4 characters. So for 1000, the output would be "1000K", which is 5 characters. But that's not allowed. So perhaps the function should not round to two significant digits in that case.

Wait, but the problem says that the output should be <=4 characters. So for numbers that would require more than 4 characters, we need to adjust the rounding. For example, if the value is 1000, then the output is "1K" (but that's not correct). Wait, no. Because 1000 is 1000 K, which is 1M. So the function should adjust the exponent again.

So perhaps the correct approach is to find the exponent n such that the value after division is between 1 and 999.999... So that when we round to two significant digits, the string is 2 digits plus the unit, which is 3 characters. But if the value is 1000, then that's 1000 K, which is 1M. So the code needs to check if the value is >= 1000, then adjust the exponent.

But how to do that. Let me think of the code again.

Let me think of the steps:

1. Find the exponent n such that 1000^n <= x < 1000^(n+1). So for
