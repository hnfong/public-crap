Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Remember to answer all the questions

Q1.

assistant
Q1. The eventual output of the given Python program is "Done".

Explanation:
The program starts with `x = 0.0` and enters an infinite loop where it increments `x` by `1.0` in each iteration. Since `x` is initialized to `0.0`, the loop will continue indefinitely. The loop will continue until `x` exceeds `math.inf`, which is a very large number.

The output of the program will be "Done" when the loop terminates due to the program reaching `math.inf`.

Q2. The eventual output of the given Python program is different from the results above.

Explanation:
The program starts with `x = 1.0` and enters an infinite loop where it increments `x` by `1.001` in each iteration. Since `x` is initialized to `1.0`, the loop will continue indefinitely. The loop will continue until `x` exceeds `math.inf`, which is a very large number.

The output of the program will be "Done" when the loop terminates due to the program reaching `math.inf`.

Q3. Yes, there are inputs that will lead to the output "Done".

Explanation:
The program will output "Done" when the user enters a number that is less than `math.inf`. For example, if the user enters `100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
