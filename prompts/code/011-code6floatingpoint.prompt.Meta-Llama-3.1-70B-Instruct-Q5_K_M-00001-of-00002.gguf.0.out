Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

A nice set of questions about the quirks of floating-point arithmetic!

**Q1.**

The eventual output of the program will be `inf`.

Here's why: in IEEE 754 floating-point representation, the maximum finite value that can be represented is approximately 1.7976931348623157e+308. When `x` reaches this value, adding 1.0 to it will result in an overflow, and `x` will become `inf`. This is because the exponent of the floating-point representation is incremented until it reaches the maximum value, at which point the mantissa is set to 0 and the exponent is set to the maximum value, resulting in `inf`.

So, the loop will eventually terminate when `x` overflows to `inf`, and the program will print `inf`.
