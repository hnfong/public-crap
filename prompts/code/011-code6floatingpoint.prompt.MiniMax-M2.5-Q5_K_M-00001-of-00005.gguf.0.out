**Q1.** The loop starts with `x = 0.0` and adds `1.0` each iteration while `x < math.inf`. Since `1.0` is added repeatedly, `x` will keep growing: 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, … eventually reaching very large finite values, then finally reaching **inf**. Once `x` becomes `inf`, the condition `x < math.inf` is **False** (because `inf` is not less than `inf`), so the loop stops and prints `inf`.

**Output:** `inf`

**Q2.** The loop starts with `x = 1.0` and multiplies by `1.001` each iteration while `x < math.inf`. Each step makes `x` larger: 1.0, 1.001, 1.002001, … This will keep increasing and eventually overflow to `inf`. When a floating‑point value becomes too large to represent, it turns into `inf`. Once `x` is `inf`, the condition `x < math.inf` is false, the loop ends, and it prints `inf`.

**Output:** `inf`

**Is it different from Q1?** No – both programs eventually print `inf`. The paths are slightly different (addition vs. multiplication), but the end result is the same: the loop terminates when the value overflows to infinity.

---

**Q3.** The program adds `inc` to `x` repeatedly until `x` reaches infinity. We need inputs `inc` such that repeatedly adding `inc` to `0.0` eventually makes `x` become `inf`. This happens when the cumulative sum overflows to `inf`.

In IEEE‑754 binary64, the largest finite representable value is about `1.7976931348623157e+308`. Adding a positive `inc` repeatedly will eventually exceed this bound and become `inf`. So **any positive non‑zero `inc`** will eventually cause overflow (though for very small `inc` it may take an astronomically large number of iterations).

Examples:

1. `inc = 1.0` – after about `1.8e308` additions the sum overflows.
2. `inc = 1e-10` – still overflows after enough iterations (≈ `1.8e318` steps).

If `inc` is negative, `x` will go to `-inf` instead, but the condition `x < math.inf` remains true (since `-inf < inf`), so the loop never stops – it would run forever (or until manually interrupted). If `inc` is `0.0`, `x` stays `0.0` forever, so it also never terminates.

Thus, any **positive** (non‑zero) input will eventually cause the loop to exit and print `"Done"`. Two concrete examples:

- Enter `1.0`
- Enter `0.1`

Both will eventually overflow to `inf` and print `Done`. (The exact number of iterations differs, but the outcome is the same.) [end of text]
