This source code file is designed to handle and process multilingual definitions and examples, particularly for a dictionary or lexicon system. Here's a high-level overview of what it does:

1. **Tag and Label Management**: It defines various tags and labels that can be used to categorize and annotate entries in the dictionary. These tags and labels help in identifying parts of speech, synonyms, antonyms, references, images, and other attributes.

2. **Language Handling**: The code includes mechanisms to handle multiple languages, including detecting and processing language codes, and ensuring that text is correctly formatted and translated.

3. **Definition Parsing**: It parses strings that contain definitions and examples, extracting and validating tags, parts of speech, labels, and other metadata. It can handle multilingual content and ensure that the definitions are structured correctly.

4. **Error Handling**: The code defines several custom exceptions to handle specific errors related to invalid input, such as incorrect parts of speech, labels, or pronunciation formats.

5. **Serialization and Deserialization**: It provides methods to convert definitions and examples into serialized formats (like JSON) and back, making it easier to store and retrieve data.

6. **Grammar and Pronunciation Checking**: The code includes functionality to check the grammar of example sentences and validate pronunciations, ensuring that the entries are accurate and consistent.

7. **HTML Formatting**: It can format explanations and examples into HTML, making them suitable for display on a webpage. This includes handling special characters and ensuring that the output is safe from cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

8. **Multilingual Support**: The code supports multiple languages and can handle translations, ensuring that definitions and examples are available in different languages.

9. **Data Validation**: It validates the input data to ensure that it conforms to the expected formats and structures, raising errors when necessary.

In summary, this file is part of a system that manages and processes dictionary entries, ensuring that they are correctly tagged, translated, and formatted for display and storage. [end of text]
