To perform a binary search on a text file containing sorted names, we can leverage the fact that the file is sorted lexicographically. The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, which allows us to find the target name in \(O(\log(n))\) operations, where \(n\) is the number of lines in the file.

Here's how you can implement the `binary_search_file` function in Python:

1. **Open the file**: We'll open the file in read mode.
2. **Determine the number of lines**: We'll count the number of lines in the file to determine the range for the binary search.
3. **Binary search**: We'll perform the binary search by reading the appropriate line(s) from the file and comparing them with the target.
4. **Return the result**: If the target is found, return its position. If not, return the insertion point.

Here's the Python function:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Count the number of lines in the file
        num_lines = sum(1 for _ in file)
        
        # Initialize the search range
        low, high = 0, num_lines - 1
        
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            
            # Move the file pointer to the middle line
            file.seek(0)
            for _ in range(mid):
                file.readline()
            
            # Read the middle line
            line = file.readline().strip()
            
            if line == target:
                return mid
            elif line < target:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1
        
        # If the target is not found, return the insertion point
        return low

# Example usage:
# file_path = 'sorted_names.txt'
# target = 'John'
# position = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
# print(f"The position of '{target}' is {position}")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Counting Lines**: The line `num_lines = sum(1 for _ in file)` counts the number of lines in the file. This is done by iterating through the file and counting each line.

2. **Binary Search**:
   - **Initialization**: We initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to `num_lines - 1`.
   - **Mid Calculation**: `mid = (low + high) // 2` calculates the middle index.
   - **File Pointer Movement**: `file.seek(0)` resets the file pointer to the beginning, and `for _ in range(mid): file.readline()` moves the pointer to the `mid`-th line.
   - **Line Reading**: `line = file.readline().strip()` reads the `mid`-th line and strips any leading/trailing whitespace.
   - **Comparison**: We compare the read line with the target. If they match, we return the current index `mid`. If the line is less than the target, we search the right half by setting `low = mid + 1`. Otherwise, we search the left half by setting `high = mid - 1`.

3. **Insertion Point**: If the loop exits without finding the target, `low` will be the insertion point where the target should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

This approach ensures that we perform the binary search in \(O(\log(n))\) operations, where \(n\) is the number of lines in the file. [end of text]
