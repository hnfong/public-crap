What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)

model
This program will output **inf** (infinity). Here's why:

* **Infinite Loop:** The `while x < math.inf:` condition creates a loop that continues as long as `x` is less than infinity.
* **Gradual Increase:** Inside the loop, `x` is multiplied by 1.001 in each iteration. This causes `x` to grow exponentially, albeit very slowly.
* **Reaching Infinity:**  Because `x` constantly increases, it will eventually exceed the representable limits of floating-point numbers in Python. At this point, `x` effectively becomes `inf` (infinity), satisfying the loop condition and causing the loop to terminate.
* **Final Output:** The `print(x)` statement then outputs the final value of `x`, which is `inf`. [end of text]
