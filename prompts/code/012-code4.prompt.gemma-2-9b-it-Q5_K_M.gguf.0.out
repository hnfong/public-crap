What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)

model
This program will result in an **infinite loop** and never produce an output. Here's why:

* **`math.inf`:** This represents positive infinity. It's a concept, not a finite number.
* **`while x < math.inf:`:** This loop condition will *always* be true because `x` will never reach infinity.  
* **`x += 1.0`:** Inside the loop, `x` is continuously incremented by 1.

Since the loop condition is always met, the program will keep adding 1 to `x` forever, effectively running indefinitely.
