What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)

The program is supposed to print the value of x when it is less than infinity. But in Python, the `math.inf` is not less than any number, it's actually a special value in math that represents positive infinity.

So, when the while loop runs, x will start at 0.0, then 1.0, 2.0, ..., but it will never be less than `math.inf`. So, the while loop will never be exited. 

This will lead to an infinite loop, and since there is no break condition in the while loop, the program will keep running until the memory is exhausted, at which point it will crash.

Here is the fixed code:

```python
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
   x += 1.0
   print(x)
```

This code will print all the numbers from 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive, then stop, as x will be greater than or equal to `math.inf` when it is printed.

However, if you want the output to be `0.0`, you can add a condition to exit the loop when x is greater than 0:

```python
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf and x > 0:
   x += 1.0
   print(x)
```

This code will print all the numbers from 0.0 to 1.0 inclusive, then stop, as x will be greater than 0 when it is printed.
