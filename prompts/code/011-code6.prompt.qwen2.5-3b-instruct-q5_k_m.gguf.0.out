Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

The program will continue to increment `x` by `inc` until `x` is greater than or equal to infinity (`math.inf`). Since `math.inf` is a constant representing infinity, it is impossible to reach this condition with finite increments. Therefore, the program will never terminate based on the given logic.

However, if we interpret the question as asking for inputs that would cause the program to run for a long time (i.e., inputs that would make the program take a very long time to terminate), we can consider the following:

1. **Very small increment (`inc`)**: If `inc` is a very small positive number, the program will take a very long time to increment `x` by a significant amount. For example, if `inc = 1e-10`, the program will take a very long time to reach a value of `x` that is appreciably larger than 0.

2. **Zero increment (`inc`)**: If `inc` is zero, the program will never increment `x`, and thus will never terminate. This is not a valid input for the program.

Given these interpretations, here are two examples of inputs that would cause the program to run for a very long time:

1. **`inc = 1e-10`**: This is a very small positive number, and the program will increment `x` by this small amount repeatedly, taking a very long time to reach a value of `x` that is appreciably larger than 0.

2. **`inc = 0`**: This is zero, and the program will never increment `x`, leading to an infinite loop.

Since the program will never terminate with a finite `inc` (other than zero), the only valid interpretation is that the program will run indefinitely for very small positive increments. [end of text]
