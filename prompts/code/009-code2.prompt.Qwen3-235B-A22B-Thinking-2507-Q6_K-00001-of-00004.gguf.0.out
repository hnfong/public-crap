<think>
Okay, let's see. The problem is to perform a binary search on a text file where the lines are sorted lexicographically. The goal is to find the byte position of the target string or the insertion point, using O(log n) operations.

First, I need to understand how binary search works on a file. Normally, binary search on an array is straightforward because you can access any element in O(1) time. But with a file, especially a text file where lines can be of varying lengths, it's trickier because you can't directly jump to the nth line without reading through the previous lines.

Wait, but the problem says "using at most O(log(n)) operations". So the approach must involve seeking to certain byte positions in the file and reading lines around those positions to determine the correct half to search next.

Hmm. The key here is that the file is sorted lexicographically, so each line is in order. But since lines can be of different lengths, the middle of the file in terms of bytes isn't necessarily the middle line.

So the standard approach for binary searching a file is to treat the file as a sequence of lines, but since we can't index lines directly, we need a way to find the middle line efficiently.

Wait, but how do you find the middle line? For example, if the file has n lines, the middle line is at position n/2. But without knowing where each line starts, you can't jump directly to it.

Ah, but maybe we can use the file's byte positions. The idea is to perform binary search on the byte offsets of the file. Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps the approach is similar to the one used in the 'bisect' module but adapted for files. Let me think.

In a typical binary search for a sorted list, you have low and high indices. For a file, the 'indices' would be byte positions. But the problem is that the elements (lines) are variable-length, so the middle byte position may not correspond to the start of a line.

So the steps might be:

1. Determine the total size of the file to know the high byte position.

2. Use binary search on the byte range [0, file_size], but when checking a mid byte position, we need to find the start of the line that contains that mid position.

Wait, here's a common technique: when you seek to a byte position in the middle of the file, you might be in the middle of a line. So you need to scan forward and backward to find the start of the current line (i.e., the next newline after the mid point, or the previous newline before it).

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

- Start with low = 0, high = file_size.

- While low < high:

   - mid = (low + high) // 2

   - Seek to mid, then read forward to the next newline to get the start of the next line (so that we're at the beginning of a line).

   - Read that line.

   - Compare with target.

   - Adjust low or high based on comparison.

But how do we find the start of the line containing mid?

Wait, maybe when you seek to mid, you need to find the beginning of the line that mid is part of. So you might have to read backward until you find a newline (or the start of the file), then read forward to get the entire line.

But reading backward in a file is not straightforward because files are typically read sequentially. However, in Python, you can seek to a position and read backward by seeking to a previous position and reading a chunk.

Alternatively, when you seek to mid, you can read a few bytes before mid to find the previous newline, which marks the start of the current line.

For example, suppose mid is at position 100. You seek to max(0, 100 - some buffer), read a chunk, find the last newline in that chunk, then the start of the line is after that newline.

This way, you can determine the start of the line that contains the mid byte position.

Once you have the start of the line, you can read the entire line (until the next newline) and compare it with the target.

So the steps for each iteration would be:

1. Compute mid = (low + high) // 2.

2. Seek to mid, then find the start of the line containing mid.

3. Read the line starting at that position.

4. Compare the line with the target.

5. Adjust low or high accordingly.

But how to find the start of the line?

Let's think: when you seek to mid, you might be in the middle of a line. To find the start of that line, you need to look for the previous newline character. So you can seek to a position before mid (like mid - 100, but not less than 0), read a chunk, and find the last occurrence of '\n' in that chunk. The start of the line would be after that '\n'.

For example, if mid is 100, and the previous newline is at 85, then the line starts at 86.

Once you have the start position, you can seek to that position and read the line until the next newline.

This process allows you to get the line that contains the mid byte position.

Now, the binary search would proceed by comparing this line with the target.

If the line is less than the target, we need to search the part after this line.

If it's greater or equal, search the part before.

Wait, but how do we determine the next low or high?

Let's say the current line starts at 'start_pos' and ends at 'end_pos' (the position of the newline).

If the line is less than target, then the target must be after this line, so low = end_pos + 1.

If the line is >= target, then high = start_pos.

Wait, but in binary search for insertion point (bisect_left), we want the first position where the line is >= target.

So the standard bisect_left logic applies here.

But the challenge is translating the line positions into byte positions.

Another thing to consider: the file may not end with a newline. But the problem statement's example includes lines that end with newlines, like "1 I go to school\n", etc. So perhaps each line is terminated by a newline, except possibly the last line. But the problem says "lines that contain names", so maybe each line is a separate entry, and the file is properly formatted with newlines.

Assuming that each line ends with a newline character (like '\n'), except possibly the last line. But in the example given, the last line is "zoo zoo zoo", which in the example is written as a line, so perhaps it does have a newline. Wait, the example shows:

```
1 I go to school
2 by bus
foo bar
hello world
zoo zoo zoo
```

Each line is on its own, so in the file, each line is followed by a newline. So the file size would be the sum of each line's length plus 1 (for the newline), except maybe the last line. Wait, but in the example, the last line is "zoo zoo zoo", which in the code block is written as a line, so it's likely that the file has a newline at the end. But perhaps not. Hmm.

But regardless, the code needs to handle lines properly.

Now, back to the algorithm.

The binary search will work on the byte positions, but each comparison requires finding the line that starts at or before the mid byte.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the problem as finding the first line that is >= target. The insertion point is the byte position where the target would be inserted, which is the start of the first line >= target.

So the binary search is over the possible line start positions.

But how to find the line start positions without scanning the entire file?

The key insight is that during the binary search, when we pick a mid byte position, we can find the start of the line containing that mid position, then compare that line with the target. Based on the comparison, we adjust the search range.

Let's outline the steps:

1. Open the file in binary mode.

2. Get the file size (using seek(0, 2) to get the end).

3. Initialize low = 0, high = file_size.

4. While low < high:

   a. mid = (low + high) // 2

   b. Seek to mid, then find the start of the line (by looking for the previous newline).

   c. Read the line starting at that start position.

   d. Compare the line (without the newline) with the target.

   e. If line >= target: high = start_pos (since we need to look before this line)

   f. Else: low = end_pos (the position after the newline of this line)

5. Return low, which is the insertion point.

Wait, but how to find the start_pos and end_pos.

Let's think about step 4b and 4c.

When we seek to mid, we need to find the start of the line that mid is in.

For example, suppose the file is:

"abc\ndef\nghi\n"

Positions 0-2: abc, 3 is \n, 4-6: def, 7 is \n, etc.

If mid is 5, which is in the 'def' line (positions 4-6), then the start of the line is 4.

To find start_pos:

- Seek to mid, then read backward to find the previous newline.

But reading backward in a file is not straightforward. However, we can seek to a position before mid (like mid - 100, but not less than 0), read a chunk, and find the last newline in that chunk.

For example, if mid is 5, we might seek to 0 (if mid is small), read up to 5+1 bytes, find the last newline before 5.

Alternatively, seek to mid, then read a few bytes backward.

But in Python, files are seekable, so we can seek to a position and read.

Here's a way to find the start of the line containing mid:

- Seek to mid.

- Read a buffer of, say, 100 bytes before mid (but not before the start of the file), then look for the last occurrence of '\n' in that buffer.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is:

- Seek to mid.

- Read a chunk starting from max(0, mid - 100) to mid + 100 (but not beyond file size), then find the last newline before mid.

But this could be inefficient if lines are very long, but since we're doing O(log n) operations, and each operation reads a constant amount of data (like 200 bytes), the total I/O is O(log n) * O(1) = O(log n), which meets the requirement.

So, for a given mid:

1. Determine a start_offset = max(0, mid - 100)

2. Seek to start_offset.

3. Read a chunk of size (mid - start_offset) + 100 (to cover up to mid + 100, but not beyond file size).

4. Find the last occurrence of '\n' in the chunk before mid - start_offset.

Wait, perhaps more precisely:

The chunk is from start_offset to some end, but we need to find the last newline before mid.

Wait, the idea is to find the position of the newline that precedes mid. So in the chunk that includes from some point before mid up to mid, find the last '\n'.

For example, if mid is 100, and the previous newline is at 85, then the line starts at 86.

So steps:

- Read a buffer that starts at max(0, mid - buffer_size) and has length buffer_size * 2 (to cover mid and some after).

Wait, perhaps a buffer of 100 bytes before mid and 100 after.

But to find the start of the line containing mid, we need to find the last newline before mid.

So:

buffer = file.read(mid - start_offset + 100)  # not sure.

Alternatively, seek to max(0, mid - 100), read 200 bytes (or until end of file).

Then, in that buffer, find the last occurrence of '\n' that is before (mid - start_offset).

Wait, start_offset is max(0, mid - 100), so the buffer starts at start_offset.

The position of mid within the buffer is mid - start_offset.

We need to find the last '\n' in the buffer before (mid - start_offset).

Once found, the start of the line is start_offset + index_of_last_newline + 1.

If no newline is found (which would mean that mid is in the first line), then start_pos is 0.

Once start_pos is determined, seek to start_pos and read until the next newline to get the line.

Then compare the line (without the newline) with the target.

Now, for the binary search:

We want to find the first line that is >= target.

So during each iteration:

- If the current line >= target, we set high = start_pos (because the insertion point is at or before this line's start).

- Else, low = end_pos (the position after the newline of this line).

Wait, end_pos is start_pos + len(line) + 1 (for the newline). But if the line is the last line and there's no newline, then end_pos is file_size.

But assuming that each line ends with a newline, except possibly the last line.

But the problem statement's example includes lines that are separate, so perhaps each line ends with a newline. Let's assume that for simplicity.

So, for a line that starts at start_pos, the line content is up to the next '\n', so the end_pos is start_pos + len(line) + 1 (since the newline is part of the line's end).

Wait, the line in the file is "text\n", so the line's byte length is len("text") + 1.

So when we read the line, we read until '\n', and the end_pos is start_pos + len(line) (including the newline).

Wait, for example, "abc\n" starts at 0, ends at 3 (positions 0,1,2,3: 'a','b','c','\n'). So the line's end position is 4? No, position 3 is the newline. So the next line starts at 4.

So start_pos is 0, line is "abc\n", which is 4 bytes. So end_pos is start_pos + 4.

Thus, after this line, the next line starts at 4.

So in the binary search:

If current line < target, then we need to search after this line, so low = end_pos.

If current line >= target, high = start_pos.

This is similar to the standard bisect_left.

Now, putting this all together.

The function binary_search_file needs to:

- Open the file in binary mode.

- Get the file size.

- Initialize low = 0, high = file_size.

- While low < high:

   - mid = (low + high) // 2

   - Find start_pos of the line containing mid.

   - Read the line starting at start_pos.

   - Determine end_pos (start_pos + len(line)).

   - Compare line (without newline?) with target.

Wait, the line read from the file includes the newline. So when comparing, we need to compare the line without the newline, or including it?

The target is given as bytes, e.g., b"2 by". The lines in the file are like "2 by bus\n", so when comparing, we need to compare the target with the line up to the newline.

Wait, the example says binary_search_file("myfile.txt", b"2 by") should return 17.

Looking at the example file:

The lines are:

"1 I go to school\n" (length 16 + 1 = 17? Wait, let's count:

"1 I go to school" is 15 characters, plus \n is 16 bytes. So positions 0-15: 16 bytes.

Then "2 by bus\n" is 9 characters + \n = 10 bytes. So starts at 16, ends at 25 (16+10-1=25).

Wait, the example says that the target is b"2 by", and the return is 17.

Wait, the file content as given:

Line 1: "1 I go to school" followed by newline: let's count the bytes.

"1 I go to school" is 1 (char) + space + I + space + g + o + ... Let's see:

"1 I go to school" has:

1, space, I, space, g, o, space, t, o, space, s, c, h, o, o, l → 16 characters. So 16 bytes, plus \n is 17 bytes. So the first line is 17 bytes (positions 0-16).

Then the next line is "2 by bus\n". Let's count:

"2 by bus" is 8 characters (2, space, b, y, space, b, u, s), plus \n → 9 bytes. So starts at 17 (position 17 is '2'), ends at 17+9-1=25.

The target is b"2 by", which is 5 bytes (2, space, b, y). So in the file, the line starts with "2 by bus\n", so the target "2 by" is a prefix of the line.

The function should return the start position of the line that is >= target. Since "2 by bus" is >= "2 by", the insertion point is the start of this line, which is 17.

Yes, so the function returns 17.

So when comparing, we need to compare the target with the line (including the newline? Or not?).

Wait, the line in the file is "2 by bus\n", but the target is "2 by". So when comparing, the line's content up to the newline is "2 by bus", which is greater than "2 by".

So the comparison should be between the target and the line without the newline.

Wait, but the target may not include a newline. So when reading the line from the file, we read until the newline, then compare the target with the line content (without the newline).

Wait, but in the example, the target is b"2 by", and the line is "2 by bus", so "2 by" is a prefix. So "2 by" < "2 by bus", so the line is greater than the target.

Wait, but the problem says "returns the (byte) position of the target, or the insertion point (as in 'bisect_left')".

bisect_left returns the first position where the element can be inserted to maintain order. So if the target is present, it returns the first occurrence.

In the example, the target "2 by" is not a complete line, but the line "2 by bus" starts with it. So the insertion point for "2 by" would be the start of "2 by bus", since "2 by" comes before "2 by bus" lexicographically.

Wait, no: "2 by" is less than "2 by bus", because "2 by" is a prefix. So in lex order, "2 by" < "2 by bus".

Therefore, the insertion point for "2 by" would be before the line "2 by bus", but where?

Wait, the lines are sorted lex order. Let's list the lines in the example:

The example file:

1 I go to school

2 by bus

foo bar

hello world

zoo zoo zoo

Assuming each line is as written, with newlines.

So the lines in order are:

"1 I go to school\n", "2 by bus\n", "foo bar\n", etc.

Wait, but "1..." comes before "2...", which comes before "f...", etc.

Now, the target is "2 by". Let's compare with the lines.

The first line is "1 I go to school\n" → "1..." which is less than "2...".

The second line is "2 by bus\n" → "2 by bus".

The target "2 by" is less than "2 by bus", because "2 by" is a prefix.

So in the sorted list, "2 by" would come before "2 by bus".

Therefore, the insertion point is between the first line and the second line.

Wait, but the first line ends at position 16 (assuming 0-based), and the second line starts at 17.

Wait, let's calculate the exact positions.

Assuming the file is:

Line 1: "1 I go to school\n" → let's count the bytes.

"1 I go to school" is 15 characters (1, space, I, space, g, o, space, t, o, space, s, c, h, o, o, l → wait, 1 is one character, then space (1), I (1), space (1), g (1), o (1), space (1), t (1), o (1), space (1), s (1), c (1), h (1), o (1), o (1), l (1). Wait, that's 1 (1) + 1 (space) + 1 (I) + 1 (space) + 2 (go) + 1 (space) + 2 (to) + 1 (space) + 6 (school) → total 1+1+1+1+2+1+2+1+6= 16 characters. So "1 I go to school" is 16 bytes, plus \n is 17 bytes. So positions 0-16 (17 bytes).

Then line 2: "2 by bus\n" → "2 by bus" is 8 characters (2, space, b, y, space, b, u, s), plus \n → 9 bytes. So starts at 17, ends at 17+9-1=25.

So the target "2 by" (5 bytes: '2', ' ', 'b', 'y') would compare as follows:

The first line is "1...", which is less than "2...".

The second line starts with "2 by bus", which is greater than "2 by".

So the insertion point is at the start of the second line, which is 17. Hence, the function returns 17.

Ah, right. Because "2 by" is less than "2 by bus", so it should be inserted before the second line, which starts at 17.

Wait, no: insertion point is the position where you would insert the target to keep the list sorted. Since "2 by" comes before "2 by bus", the insertion point is at the start of the "2 by bus" line, which is 17.

Yes, because all lines before that are less than the target.

So the bisect_left would return the index of the first line >= target. In this case, the second line is the first one >= target, so the insertion point is the start of that line.

Therefore, when comparing the line (without newline) with the target, if line >= target, then we set high = start_pos.

Else, low = end_pos.

Now, back to the algorithm.

The key steps are:

For each mid in the binary search:

- Find the start of the line containing mid.

- Read that line (up to newline).

- Compare line (without newline) with target.

- Adjust low/high.

Now, implementing this in Python.

First, open the file in binary mode.

Get the file size:

with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:

    f.seek(0, 2)

    size = f.tell()

Then, low = 0, high = size.

While low < high:

    mid = (low + high) // 2

    f.seek(mid)

    # Find start of line containing mid

    # How?

    # Read some data around mid to find the previous newline.

    # Let's set a buffer size, say 100.

    buffer_size = 100

    start_offset = max(0, mid - buffer_size)

    f.seek(start_offset)

    # Read up to buffer_size * 2, but not beyond file size.

    chunk = f.read(mid - start_offset + buffer_size)

    # Now, find the last newline in chunk before (mid - start_offset)

    # pos_in_chunk is the position within chunk where mid is.

    pos_in_chunk = mid - start_offset

    # Look for the last '\n' in chunk[0:pos_in_chunk+1]

    # Because the newline could be at pos_in_chunk.

    # Find the rightmost '\n' before or at pos_in_chunk.

    newline_pos = chunk.rfind(b'\n', 0, pos_in_chunk + 1)

    if newline_pos == -1:

        # No newline found before mid, so this is the first line.

        start_pos = 0

    else:

        start_pos = start_offset + newline_pos + 1

    # Now, seek to start_pos and read the line.

    f.seek(start_pos)

    line = f.readline()

    # line includes the newline, if present.

    # Compare line (without newline) with target.

    # But target may not have a newline.

    # So compare target with line.rstrip(b'\n')

    # But need to be careful: if line ends with \r\n, but the problem says text file, which in Python 'rb' mode reads \n as is.

    # Assuming lines are separated by \n.

    line_content = line.rstrip(b'\n')

    if line_content >= target:

        high = start_pos

    else:

        # end_pos is start_pos + len(line)

        end_pos = start_pos + len(line)

        low = end_pos

After the loop, return low.

Wait, but what if the file does not end with a newline? For example, the last line may not have a newline. In that case, readline() would read until EOF, and line would not have a newline.

But in the comparison, line_content is line.rstrip(b'\n'), which would be the same as line if there's no newline.

But the target is compared as is.

This should handle both cases.

Now, testing this logic with the example.

Example file:

Lines:

"1 I go to school\n" (17 bytes: 0-16)

"2 by bus\n" (9 bytes: 17-25)

"foo bar\n" (8 bytes: 26-33)

"hello world\n" (12 bytes: 34-45)

"zoo zoo zoo\n" (12 bytes: 46-57)

Wait, let's calculate exact positions.

Assuming:

Line 1: "1 I go to school\n" → 16 characters + \n → 17 bytes. So starts at 0, ends at 16 (inclusive), next line starts at 17.

Line 2: "2 by bus\n" → 8 characters + \n → 9 bytes. Starts at 17, ends at 25 (17+9-1=25).

Line 3: "foo bar\n" → 7 +1=8 bytes. Starts at 26, ends at 33.

Line 4: "hello world\n" → 11 +1=12 bytes. Starts at 34, ends at 45.

Line 5: "zoo zoo zoo\n" → 11 +1=12 bytes. Starts at 46, ends at 57.

File size is 58 (since 57 is the last byte, 0-based, so size is 58).

Now, target is b"2 by".

We need to find the insertion point, which is 17.

Let's simulate the binary search.

Initial low=0, high=58.

First mid = (0+58)//2 = 29.

We seek to 29.

start_offset = max(0, 29-100) = 0.

Read chunk from 0 to 29+100, but since file size is 58, read up to 58.

But in code, we read mid - start_offset + buffer_size = 29 -0 +100=129, but file size is 58, so chunk is 58 bytes.

But pos_in_chunk is 29.

Looking for last \n before or at 29.

In the file, the newlines are at 16, 25, 33, 45, 57.

So at position 29, which is in line 3 ("foo bar\n" starts at 26, ends at 33).

The previous newline is at 25 (end of line 2).

So newline_pos in chunk (which is the entire file up to 58) at position 25.

start_offset is 0, so start_pos = 0 +25 +1 =26.

Read line starting at 26: "foo bar\n".

line_content is "foo bar".

Compare with target "2 by": "foo bar" > "2 by" (since 'f' > '2'), so high =26.

Now low=0, high=26.

mid =13.

start_offset = max(0,13-100)=0.

Read chunk from 0, up to 13+100, but file size is 58.

pos_in_chunk=13.

Looking for last \n before 13.

The newlines are at 16, which is after 13. So no newline before 13 in the chunk.

Thus, newline_pos is -1, start_pos=0.

Read line from 0: "1 I go to school\n".

line_content is "1 I go to school".

Compare with "2 by": "1..." < "2...", so low = end_pos =0 + len(line) =17.

Now low=17, high=26.

mid=(17+26)//2=21.

start_offset=21-100= max(0, -79)=0.

Read chunk from 0 to 21+100, but file size 58.

pos_in_chunk=21.

Looking for last \n before 21.

Newlines at 16 (line 1 ends), 25 (line 2 ends). 16 <21 <25.

So newline_pos=16.

start_pos=0+16+1=17.

Read line from 17: "2 by bus\n".

line_content="2 by bus".

Compare with target "2 by": "2 by bus" > "2 by", so high=17.

Now low=17, high=17. Loop ends. Return 17. Correct.

Yes, this works.

Another test case: target is "2 by bus".

We want to find the start of that line, which is 17.

In the comparison, line_content is "2 by bus", which equals the target (assuming target is b"2 by bus").

Wait, but the target in the example is b"2 by", but if target is b"2 by bus", then line_content equals target, so high=17, and returns 17.

Another case: target is "zoo zoo zoo", returns 46.

If target is "zoo zoo zoo zoo", which is larger than all lines, returns 58 (file size), which is the insertion point at the end.

Now, edge cases:

- Empty file: returns 0.

- File with one line: if target <= line, return 0; else return len(line).

Now, implementing this in Python.

Potential issues:

- When mid is at the very end of the file.

- When the file has no newlines (single line).

- When target is before the first line.

Let's code accordingly.

The buffer size: choosing 100 is arbitrary, but should be sufficient for most lines. However, if lines are longer than 100 bytes, this may not find the previous newline. For example, if a line is 200 bytes long, and mid is in the middle of it, then start_offset = mid -100, but the previous newline is before start_offset, so the chunk read won't include it, leading to start_pos being start_offset (0 in this case), which is wrong.

Ah, this is a problem. The buffer size needs to be large enough to cover the maximum line length. But the problem states that we need O(log n) operations, but if lines can be very long, then the buffer size would need to be O(n), which would make each operation O(n), leading to O(n log n) time.

But the problem says "using at most O(log(n)) operations". So perhaps the assumption is that each line is of bounded length, or that the buffer size is considered a constant.

But in reality, for the algorithm to work correctly regardless of line length, the buffer size should be dynamically adjusted. However, that complicates things.

Wait, but the problem says "using at most O(log(n)) operations". Each operation here is a seek and read of a constant amount of data. If lines can be very long, then finding the start of the line containing mid could require reading O(n) data, which would make the total time O(n log n), which is not acceptable.

But the problem statement probably assumes that line lengths are bounded by a constant, so that each step reads O(1) data.

Alternatively, the algorithm can handle arbitrary line lengths by reading backward until a newline is found.

But how?

For example, to find the start of the line containing mid:

- Seek to mid.

- Read backward in chunks until a newline is found or the start of the file is reached.

But reading backward in a file is not directly possible in Python's file objects, but you can seek to a previous position and read forward.

Here's a better approach to find the start of the line:

1. Seek to mid.

2. Read a small buffer (e.g., 1 byte) to check if mid is at a newline. But probably not helpful.

Alternative approach:

To find the start of the line containing mid:

- Seek to mid.

- Read backward one byte at a time until a newline is found or the start of the file is reached.

But this could be slow for very long lines.

However, in terms of big O, if lines can be O(n) in length, then this step is O(n), making the total time O(n log n), which violates the O(log n) operations requirement.

But the problem states "using at most O(log(n)) operations". So perhaps the intended solution assumes that each line can be read in O(1) time, which is not realistic, but for the sake of the problem, we can assume that the line containing mid can be found in O(1) time.

Alternatively, the problem considers each seek and read of a line as one operation, regardless of line length. But that's not standard.

Hmm. The problem says "using at most O(log(n)) operations". So each iteration of the binary search is one operation, and there are O(log n) iterations. Each operation may involve reading a line, which could be O(k) where k is the line length, but the problem counts it as one operation.

But the question says "operations", which in this context probably refers to the number of times you read from the file or seek, but the problem statement is a bit vague.

Assuming that each iteration reads a constant amount of data (like a few hundred bytes), then the total I/O is O(log n), which meets the requirement.

So, proceeding with the buffer size approach, but choosing a sufficiently large buffer. However, in code, we can't know the maximum line length, so perhaps the buffer size should be increased until a newline is found.

But that complicates the code.

Alternative idea: when seeking to mid, read backward in chunks until a newline is found.

Here's a way to find the start of the line:

def find_line_start(f, mid, file_size):

    # Seek to mid

    # Read backward to find the previous newline

    # Start from mid and go backward

    pos = mid

    buffer = bytearray()

    while pos > 0:

        # Read a chunk before pos

        chunk_size = min(100, pos)

        f.seek(pos - chunk_size)

        chunk = f.read(chunk_size)

        # Look for newline in chunk

        idx = chunk.rfind(b'\n')

        if idx != -1:

            return pos - (chunk_size - idx - 1)

        pos -= chunk_size

    return 0

But this is more robust.

Wait, let's think:

We want to find the last newline before mid.

Start from mid, and read backward in chunks.

For example, if mid is 1000, read from 900-1000, check for newline. If none, read 800-900, etc.

Once a newline is found, the start of the line is after that newline.

This way, even for very long lines, we can find the start.

But this could take O(k) time where k is the line length, but the problem allows O(log n) operations, assuming that each line is O(1) in length.

But given that the problem states O(log n) operations, perhaps the intended solution uses a fixed buffer size, assuming lines are not extremely long.

In the code, to handle arbitrary line lengths, we can read backward until we find a newline.

Here's how:

To find the start of the line containing mid:

- Set pos = mid.

- While pos > 0:

   - Read a chunk of, say, 100 bytes ending at pos.

   - Look for the last newline in the chunk.

   - If found, return the position after that newline.

   - Else, set pos -= 100.

- If pos <=0, return 0.

This way, even for long lines, we can find the start.

Implementing this in Python:

def find_line_start(f, mid, file_size):

    pos = mid

    while pos > 0:

        # Read a chunk of up to 100 bytes before pos

        chunk_size = min(100, pos)

        f.seek(pos - chunk_size)

        chunk = f.read(chunk_size)

        # Find the last newline in the chunk

        idx = chunk.rfind(b'\n')

        if idx != -1:

            # The newline is at pos - chunk_size + idx

            # The start of the line is after this newline

            return pos - chunk_size + idx + 1

        pos -= chunk_size

    return 0

This function will find the start of the line containing mid.

Let's test this with mid=21 (from earlier example).

pos starts at 21.

chunk_size = min(100,21)=21.

seek to 0, read 21 bytes.

chunk is the first 21 bytes of the file.

In the example, the first line is 17 bytes ("1 I go to school\n"), so the first 21 bytes include the first line (17 bytes) and the first 4 bytes of the second line ("2 by ").

The chunk is "1 I go to school\n2 by ".

rfind(b'\n') in this chunk would find the \n at position 16 (0-based in the chunk).

So idx=16.

return pos - chunk_size + idx +1 = 21 -21 +16 +1 = 17. Correct.

Another example: mid=13.

pos=13.

chunk_size=13.

read from 0-13.

chunk is "1 I go to scho" (assuming the first line is 17 bytes).

No newline in chunk (since the newline is at 16), so idx=-1.

pos becomes 13-13=0.

loop ends, return 0. Correct.

Another example: mid=16 (the newline of first line).

pos=16.

chunk_size=16.

read from 0-16.

chunk is "1 I go to school" (16 bytes, no newline).

idx=-1.

pos=16-16=0.

return 0. But the line starts at 0, which is correct.

Wait, but mid=16 is the newline character. The line containing mid is the first line, which starts at 0.

Yes.

Another example: mid=17 (start of second line).

pos=17.

chunk_size=17.

read from 0-17.

chunk includes the first line (17 bytes: "1 I go to school\n").

rfind(b'\n') is at 16.

return 17-17 +16 +1 = 17. Correct.

This function seems to work.

So integrating this into the binary search.

Now, the code steps:

Open the file, get size.

low=0, high=size.

while low < high:

    mid = (low + high) // 2

    start_pos = find_line_start(f, mid, size)

    f.seek(start_pos)

    line = f.readline()

    line_content = line.rstrip(b'\n')

    if line_content >= target:

        high = start_pos

    else:

        low = start_pos + len(line)

return low

Wait, end_pos is start_pos + len(line), because line includes the newline (if present). For example, if line is "abc\n", len(line) is 4, so end_pos is start_pos
