```python
def abbrev_num(x):
    if x < 1000:
        return str(x)
    elif x < 1000000:
        return f"{int(x/500+0.5)//2}K" if x % 500 > 250 else f"{int(x/1000)}K"
    elif x < 1000000000:
        return f"{int(x/500000+0.5)//2}M" if x % 500000 > 250000 else f"{int(x/1000000)}M"
    else:
        return f"{int(x/500000000+0.5)//2}B" if x % 500000000 > 250000000 else f"{int(x/1000000000)}B"
```

This function works by dividing the number by the appropriate order of magnitude (K, M, B) and rounding to the nearest significant digit. It checks if the remainder is greater than half the divisor to decide whether to round up or not. This ensures the output is as short as possible while still being human-readable. Note that this function does not handle negative numbers or non-integer inputs. [end of text]
