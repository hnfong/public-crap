<think>
We are to abbreviate numbers to a string with at most 4 characters.
 The abbreviations are: K for thousands, M for millions, B for billions, etc.
 We want to round to the nearest value (e.g., 8180 becomes 8.2K, but note that 8180 is 8.18 thousands, so rounded to one decimal place? However, note the requirement: the output string should be <=4 characters.

 Let's break down the examples:
   2 => "2" (1 character)
   8180 => "8.2K" (3 characters: '8', '.', '2', and then 'K' -> but wait, that's 4 characters: '8', '.', '2', 'K')
   9385832 => "9.4M" (3 characters: '9', '.', '4', and then 'M' -> 4 characters)

 However, note that the example 8180 is represented as "8.2K", which is 4 characters. Similarly, 9385832 is "9.4M", which is 4 characters.

 But what about rounding? We are to round to the nearest value, but also we must not exceed 4 characters.

 Steps:
 1. We'll determine the appropriate unit (K, M, B, etc.) based on the number of digits.
 2. We want to represent the number with at most 4 characters. So we can have:
    - 1 digit (like 2)
    - 2 digits (like 10)
    - 3 digits (like 100)
    - 4 digits (like 1000, but note 1000 is 1K, so we don't want to output 1000, we want to output 1K which is 2 characters? Actually, 1K is 2 characters, but the example 8180 is 4 characters because we are showing one decimal place and then K.

 However, note the requirement: the output string should be <=4 characters. So we can have up to 4 characters.

 Let's think about the rounding:
   We are to round to the nearest value, but we must choose the number of digits appropriately.

 Observation:
   The examples show that we are rounding to one or two significant digits, but note the unit is also part of the string.

   For numbers >= 1000 and < 10000000 (i.e., millions), we use K (thousands). But note 8180 is 8.18 thousands, so we round to one decimal place? However, if we round 8180 to the nearest thousand, we get 8000, which is 8K. But the example output is "8.2K", which is more precise.

   The requirement says "roughly", but also the example 8180 becomes 8.2K. So we are allowed to show one decimal place if needed to fit in 4 characters? Actually, note that 8K is 2 characters, but 8.2K is 4. So we are using one decimal place to get 4 characters.

   However, what if the number is 1234? Then we can write "1.2K" (4 characters) or "1K" (2 characters). But note the requirement is to represent the number in compact form. We are allowed to use up to 4 characters, so we can choose the representation that is most compact but still accurate.

   Let's define the units and the thresholds:
     K: 1000 to 9999999 (i.e., 10^3 to 10^7 - 1)
     M: 1000000 to 999999999999 (10^6 to 10^12 - 1)
     B: 1000000000 to 999999999999999999 (10^9 to 10^18 - 1)

   But note: the example 9385832 is about 9.38 million, so we round to one decimal place? Actually, 9385832 / 1000000 = 9.385832, which rounds to 9.4 million.

   However, we must be cautious because the requirement is for the string to be <=4 characters. So for numbers in the thousands, we can have:
        If the number is between 1000 and 99999, we can represent it in thousands with up to 3 digits (including one decimal) to keep the string <=4.

   Let's consider the maximum number of digits we can have in the integer part and the decimal part:

   We have two cases for the thousands (K) unit:
        - If the number is between 1000 and 99999, then we can represent it as a 3-digit number (without decimal) or 4-digit with one decimal? But note: 1000 is 1K (2 characters) and 9999 is 9.999K (which is 6 characters) but we are limited to 4.

   Actually, the example 8180 is represented as "8.2K", which is 4 characters. So we are allowed to use one decimal place for numbers that are not too big.

   We can break the K unit into two parts:
        - Numbers from 1000 to 99999: we can represent with up to 3 digits (if we use two decimal places, that would be 5 characters including the decimal and two digits, so we can only use one decimal place or no decimal place? Let's see: 
            Without decimal: 1 to 999 -> but 1000 is 1K, 9999 is 9.999K -> too long. So we can do:
            We want to show the number in thousands, and we want the string to be <=4 characters.

            Possibilities for K:
                - If the number is less than 10000, then we can show up to 3 digits (without decimal) or 4 digits with one decimal? But note: 10000 is 10K, which is 3 characters (if we write 10K, that's 3 characters). However, 10000 is the boundary for K and M? Actually, 10000 is 10K, but 1000000 is 1M.

            Let's define the boundaries more clearly:

            We'll use:
                K: 1000 to 999999 (i.e., 10^3 to 10^6 - 1) but note 1000000 is M.

            However, the example 8180 is 8.2K, which is 8180 / 1000 = 8.18 -> rounded to one decimal place is 8.2.

            But note: 1000000 is 1M, so the K unit goes up to 999999.

            Now, for numbers in the K unit, we want to represent them with at most 3 digits (if we use two digits, then we can have one decimal place to make it 4 characters). However, we must round appropriately.

            Steps for K:
                Let n = x / 1000.0
                We want to round n to the nearest tenth (one decimal place) if the integer part of n is less than 10, because if it's 10 or more, then we might need two digits without decimal (like 10K, 11K, etc.) and that would be 3 characters (two digits and K) or 4 if we have one decimal place? But note: 10K is 3 characters, and 10.0K is 4.

            However, the requirement is to have the string <=4 characters. So we can do:

            For K:
                If n < 10, then we can represent with one decimal place (so 4 characters: two digits, a decimal, one digit, and K -> but wait, 8.2K is 4 characters, but 8K is 2 characters. We want the most compact representation? Actually, the problem says "roughly", so we can choose the representation that is most compact but still accurate.

            But note: the example 8180 is 8.2K, which is 4 characters. What if we have 1000? We can write "1K" (2 characters) or "1.0K" (4 characters). The requirement doesn't specify the exact format, but it says "compact, human readable form". So we should use the minimal number of characters that still conveys the meaning.

            However, the problem says the output string should be <=4 characters. So we can use up to 4, but we are allowed to use less. But note: the example 2 is 1 character, which is acceptable.

            Let's define the rules:

            We'll consider the following units and their thresholds (in terms of the base unit, i.e., 1000 for K, 1000000 for M, etc.):

            Unit   | Threshold (lower bound) | Threshold (upper bound) | Example
            K       | 1000                    | 999999                 | 8180 -> 8.2K (4 chars)
            M       | 1000000                 | 999999999999           | 9385832 -> 9.4M (4 chars)

            But note: 1000000 is 1M, which is 2 characters. 1000000000 is 1B, which is 2 characters.

            How to decide the number of digits and decimal places?

            We want to represent the number with as few characters as possible, but we must not lose the meaning (i.e., rounding should be to the nearest unit, and the unit is chosen appropriately).

            We can do:

            Let's define the units and their factors:
                K: 1000
                M: 1000000
                B: 1000000000
                ... and so on.

            Steps:
            1. If x < 1000, then we just return str(x) (which is <=3 characters, but note 999 is 3, 1000 is the next unit).
            2. For x >= 1000, we divide by 1000 and then by 1000000, etc. to choose the unit.

            However, we must round the number appropriately and then format it to a string that is <=4 characters.

            Let's consider the rounding and formatting for each unit:

            For K (thousands):
                Let n = x / 1000.0
                We want to round n to the nearest integer if the fractional part is negligible? But note the example 8180: 8180/1000 = 8.18, which rounds to 8.2 (one decimal place) because 8.2K is 4 characters and 8K is 2, but 8.2K is more precise and still within 4.

            However, the problem says "rounded to nearest K", but note that 8180 is 8.18 thousands, which is closer to 8.2 than 8.1? Actually, 8.18 is exactly halfway between 8.1 and 8.2? Then we round up? But note: the example output is 8.2K.

            But wait, the example says "rounded to nearest K", but 8.18K is 8180, and the nearest K (thousand) would be 8000 or 9000? Actually, the unit is K meaning thousands, so we are rounding to the nearest thousand? Then 8180 rounded to the nearest thousand is 8000, which is 8K. But the example output is 8.2K.

            Let me re-read: "rounded to nearest K" in the example 8180 => 8.2K. But note: 8180 is 8.18 thousands, and if we round to the nearest tenth of a thousand (i.e., 100) then we get 8.2. However, the problem says "K" for thousands, so we are rounding to the nearest thousand? Then 8180 is 8.18 thousands, which is 8180/1000 = 8.18, and rounding to the nearest integer thousand would be 8000 (8K). But the example output is 8.2K.

            There seems to be a nuance: the example output is rounded to one decimal place, not to the nearest integer thousand.

            The requirement says: "the output string should be <= 4 characters if at all possible". So for 8180, if we output 8K (2 characters) that is acceptable. But the example output is 8.2K (4 characters). Why?

            Let me check the example: 8180 => 8.2K. The example does not say it's rounded to the nearest integer thousand, but to the nearest K (thousand) unit. However, note that 8.2K is 8200, which is closer to 8180 than 8K (8000) is? Actually, 8200 - 8180 = 20, and 8180 - 8000 = 180, so 8200 is closer. But wait, we are rounding 8180 to the nearest thousand: 8180 is between 8000 and 9000, and the midpoint is 8500. Since 8180 < 8500, it rounds down to 8000 (8K). 

            However, the example output is 8.2K, which is 8200. So that doesn't match.

            Let me clarify: the example says "rounded to nearest K", but note that 8180 is 8.18 thousands. The rounding to the nearest K (meaning the nearest multiple of 1000) would be 8000. But the example output is 8.2K, which is 8200. 

            Alternatively, maybe the example is rounding to the nearest 100 (i.e., two significant figures) and then appending K? But then 8180 rounded to two significant figures is 8200, which is 8.2K.

            The problem says: "compact, human readable form" and "a couple significant digits". So we are to round to a couple significant digits, but then we must also consider the unit.

            Let's define the significant digits: we want to show the number with 2 significant digits (unless the number is small enough to be represented with 1 significant digit and without a decimal point, then we use 1).

            Steps for formatting:

            We'll choose the unit based on the magnitude (K, M, B, etc.). Then we'll divide the number by the unit's factor (1000 for K, 1000000 for M) and then round to 2 significant digits? But note the example 2: 2 is less than 1000, so we don't use a unit. We just output "2".

            However, for numbers in the thousands, we want to round to 2 significant digits? Let's see:

            Example 8180: 
                8180 / 1000 = 8.18 -> round to 2 significant digits: 8.2 (because 8.18 has three significant digits, but we want two? Actually, 8.18 rounded to two significant digits is 8.2).

            Example 1000: 
                1000 / 1000 = 1.0 -> round to two significant digits: 1.0, but then we can write it as "1K" (2 characters) or "1.0K" (4 characters). We want the most compact, so we can drop the trailing zero? But note: the requirement is for the string to be <=4, so both are acceptable. However, the example 2 is just "2", so we are allowed to drop the decimal part if it's zero.

            But note: the example 8180 is given as "8.2K", so we are keeping one decimal place even if it's zero? Actually, no, because 8.2K doesn't have a trailing zero. We are rounding to two significant digits, which for 8.18 is 8.2.

            How to round to two significant digits?
                We can do: 
                    n = x / factor
                    Then round n to 2 significant digits.

            However, note that the factor is 1000 for K, so we are effectively rounding to two significant digits in the thousands place.

            But what about numbers that are exactly at the boundary? For example, 999999 is 999K, but if we round to two significant digits, we get 1.0M? Actually, 999999 is less than 1000000, so it's K. 999999 / 1000 = 999.999, which rounded to two significant digits is 1000, but that would be 1M. However, 1000 is the factor for M, so we are rounding to the next unit? That doesn't seem right.

            Let me re-think: We are to represent the number in compact form. We choose the unit such that the number is between 1 and 1000 (for K, M, etc.). Then we round to two significant digits, but if the rounded number is an integer (like 1000) then we switch to the next unit.

            Alternatively, we can do:

            We'll choose the unit based on the number of digits. Then we'll divide by the unit's factor and round to two significant digits, but if the rounded number is 1000 or more, then we use the next unit.

            However, note the example 9385832: 
                It is 9.385832 million, so we round to two significant digits: 9.4 million -> "9.4M"

            Steps:

            Let's define the units and their factors in a list, starting from the smallest (thousands) to the largest (billions, etc.). We can set a limit, say up to 10^18.

            We'll do:

            if x < 1000:
                return str(x)

            else:
                Let's find the unit: 
                    K: 1000
                    M: 1000000
                    B: 1000000000
                    T: 1000000000000
                    etc.

                We can determine the unit by the number of digits. But note: we are rounding to two significant digits, so we might have numbers that are in the thousands but very close to 1000 (like 999) which we already handled, and numbers that are in the thousands but very large (like 999999) which we might round to 1M.

            Actually, we can do:

            Let unit = ''
            Let factor = 1
            Let n = x

            We'll divide by factors until we get a number between 1 and 1000 (exclusive of 1000, because 1000 is the next unit). But note: we are rounding to two significant digits, so we might have numbers that are in the thousands but when divided by 1000, they are between 1 and 1000, but we want to round to two significant digits and then format appropriately.

            However, the requirement is to have the string <=4 characters. So we can have:

            - For numbers in the thousands (K) unit: 
                Let n = x / 1000.0
                We want to round n to two significant digits, but then we must format it without unnecessary zeros.

            How to round to two significant digits?
                We can use: 
                    rounded = round(n, -2)   # This rounds to the nearest multiple of 100, but note: significant digits are about the first two non-zero digits.

            Actually, we can do:

            We want to round to two significant digits, meaning we keep two digits from the left. For example, 8180 becomes 8200 (two significant digits: 8 and 2, then the rest rounded). But note: 8180 is 8.18 thousands, so we are rounding 8.18 to two significant digits: 8.2 (because 8.18 has three significant digits, and we round the third to two).

            Steps for rounding to two significant digits:

            Let n = x / factor   (factor is the unit factor, e.g., 1000 for K)

            We want to round n to two significant digits. We can do:

            if n >= 1000:
                Then we use the next unit (i.e., factor *= 1000, and then n = x / factor, and then round to two significant digits again)

            But note: we are already dividing by the factor of the current unit, and we want the number to be in the range [1, 1000) for the current unit. So we choose the unit such that the number is in [1, 1000) after division.

            Actually, we can do:

            Let's define a list of units: [('K', 1000), ('M', 1000000), ('B', 1000000000), ('T', 1000000000000), ...]

            Then, we find the largest unit factor that is <= x.

            Then, we divide x by that factor and round to two significant digits.

            Then, we format the rounded number as a string without unnecessary zeros, and append the unit.

            But note: the rounded number might be an integer (like 1000) but we are rounding to two significant digits, so if we get 1000, that means we should have used the next unit? Actually, we are rounding to two significant digits, so 1000 is 1.0 thousand? No, 1000 is 1 thousand, but we are representing in thousands, so 1000 is 1K. However, 1K is 2 characters, but 1000 is 4 characters. We want to represent 1000 as "1K", not "1000".

            So the rounding to two significant digits is done on the number after dividing by the unit factor, and then we format that number appropriately.

            How to round to two significant digits?

            We can do:

            Let n = x / factor   (factor is the unit factor, e.g., 1000)

            We want to round n to two significant digits. We can use:

            if n < 10:
                # Then we can have one digit and one decimal place (if needed) to show two significant digits? 
                # Actually, two significant digits for a number less than 10: we need to show two digits? But note, we are in the thousands unit, so n is between 0.001 and 10 (if x is between 1 and 9999999). But wait, we are in the thousands unit, so x is at least 1000, so n is at least 1.

                # So n is at least 1 and less than 10. We want two significant digits, so we round to one decimal place? But note: 1.2345 -> round to two significant digits: 1.2 (if we round to the nearest tenth) but wait, two significant digits for 1.2345 is 1.2.

                # We can round to the nearest tenth (i.e., one decimal place) for numbers in [1, 10). But note: 1.2345 rounded to two significant digits is 1.2, but 1.2345 is closer to 1.2 than 1.3? Actually, the rule for rounding to two significant digits is to look at the third significant digit. For 1.2345, the third significant digit is 3 (in the hundredths place) and the next digit is 4, which is >=5, so we round up the second significant digit (which is 2) to 3? Then 1.2345 becomes 1.23? But wait, two significant digits: we keep two digits and round the third.

                # Actually, two significant digits for 1.2345: 
                #   We look at the first two digits: 1 and 2. Then we look at the third digit (3) and the next one (4) to decide rounding. But note: 1.2345 has four significant digits. We want to round to two.

                # We can do: 
                #   n = round(n, 1)   # This rounds to one decimal place, but that is not two significant digits. For example, 1.2345 rounded to one decimal is 1.2, which is two significant digits.

                # But what about 9.99? We want to round to 10.0? But then 10.0 is 3 significant digits. Actually, we are rounding to two significant digits, so 9.99 becomes 10 (two significant digits). Then we have to check if 10 is >=1000? No, because we are in the thousands unit, so 10 means 10 * 1000 = 10000, which is still in the thousands unit? But wait, we are representing 10000 as 10K, which is 3 characters (if we write 10K) or 4 if we write 10.0K. But note: 10K is 3 characters, which is acceptable.

            Alternatively, we can use a different approach:

            We want to represent the number with up to 4 characters. We can break the number into two parts: the integer part and the fractional part, but we are limited by the unit.

            Let's define the units and their factors, and then for each unit, we divide the number by the factor and then format the result to have at most 3 digits (if integer) or 3 digits with one decimal (if fractional) but note the total string length must be <=4.

            Actually, we can do:

            We'll choose the unit such that the number is in the range [1, 1000) (for the unit factor). Then we round the number to two significant digits, but then we format it without trailing zeros and without decimal point if the fractional part is zero.

            Steps:

            Let units = [('K', 1000), ('M', 1000000), ('B', 1000000000), ('T', 1000000000000), ('Q', 1000000000000000), ('U', 1000000000000000000), ('X', 1000000000000000000000)]

            But note: the problem doesn't specify beyond billions, so we can set a limit. However, we must be cautious because the rounding might push the number to the next unit.

            We can do:

            if x < 1000:
                return str(x)

            else:
                # Find the unit
                unit_factors = [1000, 1000000, 1000000000, 1000000000000, 1000000000000000, 1000000000000000000, 1000000000000000000000]
                unit_names = ['K', 'M', 'B', 'T', 'Q', 'U', 'X']

                # We want the largest factor that is <= x
                # But note: we are rounding to two significant digits, so we might have to adjust.

                # Let's find the unit index: 
                #   We can do: 
                #       unit_index = 0
                #       while unit_factors[unit_index] < x:
                #           unit_index += 1
                #       Then the unit is unit_names[unit_index-1] and factor = unit_factors[unit_index-1]

                # But note: we want the unit such that the number is in [1, 1000) after division. So we should choose the unit with the factor being the largest power of 1000 that is <= x.

                # Actually, we can do:

                #   factor = 1000
                #   while x >= factor * 1000:
                #       factor *= 1000

                # Then the unit is the one corresponding to factor (but note: factor is 1000^k, and we have unit_factors as 1000, 1000000, ...)

                # Alternatively, we can use logarithms to determine the unit.

            Let me propose a simpler method:

            We'll divide the number by 1000 until it is less than 1000, but we want to keep track of the factor.

            Steps:

            factor = 1000
            unit = 'K'
            count = 0
            while x >= factor * 1000 and count < len(unit_factors)-1:
                factor *= 1000
                unit = unit_names[count]
                count += 1

            Then, we have n = x / factor

            Now, we want to round n to two significant digits. But note: we are allowed to use up to 4 characters, so we can format n as:

            If n is an integer (or very close to an integer) and we round it to two significant digits, we might get an integer. Then we can output without decimal.

            How to round to two significant digits?

            We can use: 
                n_rounded = round(n, -2)   # This rounds to the nearest multiple of 100, but that is not two significant digits.

            Let me define two significant digits: we want to keep two digits from the left, and then round the rest.

            Example: 
                n = 8.18 -> two significant digits: 8.2
                n = 999.999 -> two significant digits: 1000, but then we have to check if 1000 is the rounded value, then we should use the next unit? Actually, we are already in the unit that makes n in [1, 1000). So 999.999 is in [1, 1000) and we round it to two significant digits: 1000. But 1000 is the upper bound of the current unit? Then we should use the next unit.

            So we can do:

            We round n to two significant digits, but if the rounded value is 1000 or more, then we use the next unit.

            However, note that we are in the unit that makes n in [1, 1000). So if we round n to two significant digits and get 1000, that means we are at the boundary. We can then use the next unit.

            But note: the rounding to two significant digits for 999.999 is 1000, which is exactly 1000. So we can then set factor *= 1000 and unit to the next one, and then n = x / factor, which would be 1.0 (if x was 999999000) but wait, we are rounding 999.999 to 1000, then we are effectively rounding to the next unit.

            Alternatively, we can round n to two significant digits and then if the rounded value is 1000, we set it to 1 and then use the next unit? But that would be 1M for 999999, which is correct.

            So let's do:

            n_rounded = round(n, -2)   # This rounds to the nearest multiple of 100, but note: two significant digits might require a different rounding.

            Actually, we can use:

            We want to round to two significant digits. We can do:

            if n >= 1000:
                # Then we need to use the next unit, but note we are already in the unit that makes n < 1000, so this shouldn't happen.
                # So we adjust: we use the next unit and then divide again.
                factor *= 1000
                unit = unit_names[count]
                n = x / factor

            Then, we round n to two significant digits.

            But note: we are rounding n to two significant digits, and then we format it.

            How to round to two significant digits?

            We can use: 
                n_rounded = round(n / 10**(int(math.floor(math.log10(n))) - 1), 1) * 10**(int(math.floor(math.log10(n))) - 1)

            But that is complicated.

            Alternatively, we can use:

            We want to round to two significant digits, so we can do:

            order = math.floor(math.log10(n)) if n >= 1 else 0
            # But n is at least 1 because we are in the unit that makes x>=factor and factor is the unit factor, and we are in the unit that makes n>=1.

            Then, we round to the nearest 10^(order-1) or 10^(order-2) ? 

            Actually, we can do:

            We want to round to two significant digits, so we can express n as a number between 1 and 10, then multiply by 100 and round, then divide by 100 and then by 10^(order-1) to get the two significant digits.

            Example: n = 8.18
                order = floor(log10(8.18)) = 0
                Then we round to two significant digits: we can do: 
                    n_rounded = round(n * 10**(2-order)) / 10**(2-order)

            But order is 0, so 10**(2-0)=100, then n_rounded = round(8.18 * 100) / 100 = round(818) / 100 = 818/1
