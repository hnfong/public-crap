Answer all the following questions assuming IEEE 754 floating point

Q1. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program?

```
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
```

---

Q2. What (if any) is the eventual output of the following python program? Is it different from the results above?

```
import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
```

---

Q3. Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Are there inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

---

Remember to answer all the questions

Q1.

<|im_start|>assistant
The output of the first program is `inf`. This is because the `while` loop is checking if `x` is less than `math.inf`, which is always true. Therefore, the loop will continue indefinitely, and `x` will keep increasing by `1.0` in each iteration.

Q2.

The output of the second program is `1.001`. This is because the `while` loop is checking if `x` is less than `math.inf`, which is also always true. In each iteration, `x` is multiplied by `1.001`, so the value of `x` will keep increasing by `0.001` in each iteration.

Q3.

The inputs that will lead to the output "Done" are when the user enters a positive number for `inc` and when the value of `x` is greater than or equal to `math.inf`. 

Examples of such inputs are:

1. If the user enters `inc = 2`, the loop will continue indefinitely, and the output will be "Done".
2. If the user enters `inc = 0.5`, the loop will continue indefinitely, and the output will be "Done". [end of text]
