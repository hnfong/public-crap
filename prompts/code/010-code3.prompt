Consider the following python code:

```
def s(a):
    if len(a) <= 1: return a
    p = a[0]
    l = [x for x in a[1:] if x <= p]
    r = [x for x in a[1:] if x > p]
    return l + [p,] + r
```

What is its intended purpose? Then, please review the code, focusing on mistakes (if any), coding style, efficiency, and any other implementation details that may be of note. Finally, write a new function with all your suggested fixes/improvements, but in the Rust language (not in python).
