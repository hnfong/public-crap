Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Sure! Let's start with the Python implementations of Bubble Sort and Merge Sort.

### Bubble Sort Implementation

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Example usage
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
sorted_arr = bubble_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array is:", sorted_arr)
```

### Merge Sort Implementation

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left_half = arr[:mid]
        right_half = arr[mid:]

        merge_sort(left_half)
        merge_sort(right_half)

        i = j = k = 0

        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
                arr[k] = left_half[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right_half[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        while i < len(left_half):
            arr[k] = left_half[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1

        while j < len(right_half):
            arr[k] = right_half[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1

    return arr

# Example usage
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
sorted_arr = merge_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array is:", sorted_arr)
```

### Discussion and Comparison

#### Bubble Sort
- **Algorithm**: Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Best Case: O(n) (when the list is already sorted)
  - Average Case: O(n^2)
  - Worst Case: O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) (in-place sorting)
- **Stability**: Stable (does not change the relative order of equal elements)
- **Use Cases**: Suitable for small datasets or nearly sorted datasets.

#### Merge Sort
- **Algorithm**: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the list into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Best Case: O(n log n)
  - Average Case: O(n log n)
  - Worst Case: O(n log n)
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) (requires additional space for the temporary arrays used in merging)
- **Stability**: Stable (does not change the relative order of equal elements)
- **Use Cases**: Suitable for large datasets and is often used in external sorting (sorting data that doesn't fit into memory).

### Comparison
- **Efficiency**: Merge Sort is generally more efficient than Bubble Sort for large datasets due to its O(n log n) time complexity compared to Bubble Sort's O(n^2).
- **Space**: Bubble Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm, requiring only a constant amount of additional space, while Merge Sort requires additional space proportional to the size of the input.
- **Stability**: Both algorithms are stable, meaning they preserve the relative order of equal elements.
- **Simplicity**: Bubble Sort is simpler to implement but less efficient for large datasets. Merge Sort is more complex but more efficient.

In summary, while Bubble Sort is easier to understand and implement, Merge Sort is more efficient and suitable for larger datasets.
