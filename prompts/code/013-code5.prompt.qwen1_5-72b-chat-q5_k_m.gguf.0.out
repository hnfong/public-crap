What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)

This Python program runs an infinite loop because `x` keeps increasing towards but never reaches `math.inf`. The loop will continue running indefinitely, and the `print(x)` statement will not be executed unless the program is manually interrupted.

If you interrupt the program, you'll see the last value of `x` before the interruption, which will be a very large number close to but not reaching `math.inf`. Since the actual output depends on when you interrupt the program, it's not possible to provide a specific output.
