Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search directly on a text file containing names sorted in lexicographical order, you need to be able to efficiently access specific lines in the file. This can be achieved by using a combination of file seeking and reading. Here's a step-by-step approach to implement the `binary_search_file` function:

1. **Determine the File Size**: Get the total number of lines in the file.
2. **Binary Search**: Implement the binary search algorithm to find the target or the insertion point.
3. **Seek and Read**: Use file seeking to jump to specific lines and read them.

Here's the Python code to achieve this:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    import os

    def get_line_count(file_path):
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            return sum(1 for _ in f)

    def read_line(file, line_number):
        file.seek(0)
        for _ in range(line_number):
            file.readline()
        return file.readline().strip()

    line_count = get_line_count(file_path)
    low, high = 0, line_count - 1

    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            mid_line = read_line(f, mid)

            if mid_line == target:
                return mid
            elif mid_line < target:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1

        return low  # Insertion point

# Example usage:
# position = binary_search_file('names.txt', 'John')
# print(position)
```

### Explanation:

1. **get_line_count(file_path)**:
   - This function counts the total number of lines in the file by iterating through it once.

2. **read_line(file, line_number)**:
   - This function seeks to the beginning of the file and reads lines up to the specified `line_number`, then returns the content of that line.

3. **binary_search_file(file_path, target)**:
   - This function performs the binary search. It initializes `low` and `high` pointers to the start and end of the file, respectively.
   - It uses a while loop to perform the binary search, adjusting the `low` and `high` pointers based on the comparison of the middle line with the target.
   - If the target is found, it returns the index. If not, it returns the insertion point where the target would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

### Notes:
- This implementation assumes that the file is not too large to be read efficiently with `readline()`. For very large files, more sophisticated techniques might be needed to handle file I/O efficiently.
- The `read_line` function reads lines sequentially from the start of the file, which is not the most efficient way to access lines in a large file. For better performance, you might consider using a more advanced method to estimate line positions based on file offsets.
