Here is the function `abbrev_num(x)` that meets the requirements:

```python
def abbrev_num(x):
    if x < 1000:
        return str(x)
    elif 1000 <= x < 10000:
        return f"{x}/1000"
    elif 10000 <= x < 100000:
        return f"{x}/10000"
    elif 100000 <= x < 1000000:
        return f"{x}/100000"
    elif 1000000 <= x < 10000000:
        return f"{x}/1000000"
    elif 10000000 <= x < 100000000:
        return f"{x}/10000000"
    else:
        magnitude = int(math.log10(x))
        return f"{x} {str(magnitude)}M"
```

This function first checks if the number is within the range of 1000, 10000, 100000, etc. If it is, it returns the number divided by the corresponding power of 1000 as a string. If the number is larger, it calculates the order of magnitude (the number of zeros after the decimal point) using `math.log10(x)` and then returns the number followed by the order of magnitude in the format "XM".
