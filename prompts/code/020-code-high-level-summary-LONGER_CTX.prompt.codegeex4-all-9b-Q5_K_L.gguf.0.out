This source code file is a part of a dictionary project, specifically for the Cantonese language. It defines classes and functions to parse, validate, and format definitions of words in Cantonese. Here's a high-level overview of what it does:

1. **Tag Aliases and Validation**: It defines tag aliases and their corresponding canonical forms. It also sets up validation rules for different tags, such as part of speech (POS), labels, and references.

2. **Language Handling**: It includes functions to handle language codes and determine the current language. It also provides a mechanism to force strict language code validation.

3. **Definition Parsing**: It defines classes to parse and represent definitions of words. The `MultilingualDefinition` class can parse a string into a structured format, handling tags and items. It also includes error handling for invalid inputs.

4. **Example and Explanation Formatting**: It defines classes to handle examples and explanations in different languages. The `MultilingualExample` and `MultilingualExplanation` classes parse and format these elements, including support for HTML formatting.

5. **Serialization and JSON Conversion**: It provides methods to serialize definitions and convert them into JSON format, which can be useful for data exchange or storage.

6. **Problem Checking**: It includes a method to check for potential problems in definitions, such as invalid jyutping (Cantonese pronunciation) or grammar issues.

7. **Utility Functions**: It includes utility functions for parsing written forms and pronunciations, encoding them, and formatting explanations and examples.

Overall, this file is crucial for the dictionary project, providing the necessary tools to parse, validate, and format Cantonese word definitions, making them accessible and usable in various contexts.
