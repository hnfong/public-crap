 Here's a Python function that meets the requirements:

```python
def abbrev_num(x):
    if x < 1000:
        return str(x)
    
    prefixes = [(10**12, 'T'), (10**9, 'B'), (10**6, 'M'), (10**3, 'K')]
    
    for factor, prefix in prefixes:
        if x >= factor:
            num = float(x) / factor
            if num < 10:
                return f"{num:.1f}{prefix}"
            elif num < 100:
                return f"{num:.0f}{prefix}"
            else:
                # For very large numbers, just show the prefix with the power of 10
                power = len(str(int(num))) - 1
                return f"{num / (10 ** power):.1f}{prefix[0]}{power}"
    
    # If the number is too small to be abbreviated, just return it as a string
    return str(x)
```

This function will abbreviate numbers to a human-readable form with a maximum of 4 characters, rounding to the nearest thousand, million, billion, or trillion as appropriate. It also handles very large numbers by using powers of 10 with the appropriate prefix. [end of text]
