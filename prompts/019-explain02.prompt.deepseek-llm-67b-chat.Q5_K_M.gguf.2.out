The National People’s Congress is like a big team that helps make important decisions for all of the people living in China. It has lots of members, and they meet together to talk about things like how to spend money, what rules everyone should follow, and making sure everyone in China can live happily and safely. Just like you have your own team at school with teachers who help guide you, the National People’s Congress is a special group that helps take care of people living far away in China.
