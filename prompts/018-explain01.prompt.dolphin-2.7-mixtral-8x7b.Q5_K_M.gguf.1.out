Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

 Yo, listen up, it's time to drop some knowledge,
About the big bossman who controls the doe,
It's called the Federal Reserve, they hold the key,
To America's cash flow like a king of G.

They're in charge of money like Jay-Z's fame,
Settin' interest rates and playin' the game,
They want inflation low, but not too slow,
Balancin' it out, so we all can grow.

They print the green paper, then release it to the bank,
Bringing liquidity for business owners to thank,
Lendin' cash to big corporations and small,
Keeps the economy movin', like a ball in a hall.

They watch the market, they got their eyes on us all,
When things go south, they answer the call,
With their tools of policy, stimulus or tightening,
To keep our economic game smooth and right.

So next time you're spittin' rhymes about dough,
Remember who holds the power, don't let it go,
The Federal Reserve, they got your back,
Keeping America's economy on track.
