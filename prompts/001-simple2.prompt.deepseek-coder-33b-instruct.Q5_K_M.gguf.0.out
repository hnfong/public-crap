Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?



### Response:

Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties. It's abundant because its proper divisors (excluding itself) sum to more than 120. Another property is that its digital root (the recursive sum of the digits until a single digit remains) is 9, which also results in an abundance number. Lastly, it can be expressed as the product of three primes: 2^3 * 3 * 5.

Q2: To solve this equation, we use the quadratic formula x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac) ] / (2a). In our case, a = 1, b = -7 and c = -18. Thus, our equation is x^2 + 7x - 18 = 0. Substituting these values in the formula gives us:

x = [ 7 ± sqrt((-7)² - 4*1*(-18)) ] / (2*1)
  = [ 7 ± sqrt(49 + 72) ] / 2
  = [ 7 ± sqrt(121) ] / 2

Solving for x gives:
x = 3 and x = -6.5. However, as per the quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, the value of x must be a real number, so we can discard x = -6.5 because it's not a valid solution in the real number system. Therefore, x = 3 is our only real-number solution for this equation.

Q3: The train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h, and the distance between two cities is 200km. Divide these distances by the speed to find how many hours it takes for the train to cover one round trip. Then divide that time by 24 (the number of hours in a day) to get how many round trips the train can make within a full day.

The calculation would be: RoundTrips = (Distance / SpeedPerHour) / HoursInADay, which equals (200km / 60km/h) / 24hours = 1 rounded trip. Therefore, the train can only travel one round trip within a full day.
