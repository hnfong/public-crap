Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

The program you've provided has a loop that continues to add the input value to the variable `x` until `x` is less than positive infinity (`math.inf`). However, due to the way floating point numbers work in Python (and most programming languages), there is a limit to the precision of these numbers. 

This means that even though the loop condition is `x < math.inf`, the program will eventually stop increasing `x` once it reaches the maximum representable value for a floating point number, which is approximately `1.7976931348623157e+308`.

Therefore, any positive number less than or equal to the reciprocal of the maximum representable value will eventually result in the output "Done". For example, inputs of `1.0`, `0.1`, `0.000001`, etc., would all eventually lead to the output "Done".

However, it's important to note that for very small input values, it may take an extremely long time for the program to reach the maximum representable value and print "Done". For example, if the input is `1e-300`, it would take approximately `1.7976931348623157e+308` iterations of the loop to reach the maximum representable value. This could potentially cause the program to run for an impractically long time.
