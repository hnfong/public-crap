Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.


### Response:

The given program is designed to continuously add a user-defined increment `inc` to the variable `x` until it reaches infinity or beyond. However, due to the limitations of floating point precision in Python (and most programming languages), the value of `x` will not actually reach `math.inf`. Instead, it will eventually become too large to represent accurately, at which point adding more increments will not change its value.

For example, on my machine, if I input `1e200` as the increment, the variable `x` becomes `inf` after only 3 iterations:

```
Enter a number: 1e200
Done
```

If I input a smaller value, such as `1e-200`, it takes many more iterations for `x` to become `inf`:

```
Enter a number: 1e-200
Done
```

However, this still happens eventually. In fact, for any positive increment, the loop will eventually terminate with `x == inf`. This is because adding any nonzero number to infinity repeatedly will always result in infinity. Therefore, there are infinitely many inputs that will lead to the output "Done", including (but not limited to) `1e200` and `1e-200`.
