The National People Congress, or NPC for short, is like a big meeting where important people from all over China come together and make decisions about how the country should be run. Imagine it as a huge gathering of kids who get to choose what games they want to play at school. The grown-ups in charge listen to these kids' ideas and then decide which ones will work best for everyone. This way, the whole country can agree on important things like laws and rules that help make China a better place for all its people.
