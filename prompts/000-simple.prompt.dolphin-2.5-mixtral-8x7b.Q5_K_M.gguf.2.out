 Q1: 1+1=2
Q2: 6*7=42
Q3: 83*59=4877
Q4: 349*683=238097
Q5: 6043*7489=45152007
Q6: x = 5 (To solve for x, first subtract 7 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x: 3x = 15. Then divide both sides by 3: x = 5.)
Q7: 25% of 80 = 20
Q8: The final change is $15 (The shopkeeper gives back one 20 dollar bill, and keeps the other two along with the additional five dollar bill. So, in total, she keeps $40 and gives you $15 in change.)
Q9: The perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units is 20 units (Perimeter = side_length * 4)
Q10: Her mother has 4 children.
Q11: 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1 = 6 (To evaluate the expression, first perform the division: 12 รท 4 = 3. Then perform addition and subtraction from left to right: 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.)
Q12: They need 10 slices of birthday cake (Each guest would typically get two slices, so for 5 guests, it's 5 * 2 = 10 slices.)
Q13: The sale price is $20 (To find the discounted price, multiply the original price by the percentage discount. In this case, 25% of $25 equals $6.25. Then subtract the discount from the original price: $25 - $6.25 = $18.75.)
Q14: There are 105 minutes left until 6:30 PM (There are 60 minutes in an hour, so from 3:45 PM to 4:00 PM there are 15 minutes remaining. Then another hour and a half is left between 4:00 PM and 6:30 PM, which is 90 minutes.)
Q15: 6 taxis are needed (Each taxi can carry 4 passengers. So, divide the total number of people by the number of passengers each taxi can hold to find out how many taxis are required: 22 รท 4 = 5.5, but since you cannot have half a taxi, you need an additional taxi.)
Q16: The measure of the third angle is 87 degrees (The sum of the interior angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. So, 31 + 62 + x = 180. Add 31 and 62 to get 93 + x = 180. Subtract 93 from both sides of the equation: x = 87.)
