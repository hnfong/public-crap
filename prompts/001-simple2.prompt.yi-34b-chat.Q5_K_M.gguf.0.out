Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

The number 120 is significant for several reasons:

1. It is a composite number, as it is the product of two prime numbers: 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 2^3 × 3 × 5.
2. It is the smallest number that is divisible by all the numbers from 1 to 6: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
3. It is the sum of the first six prime numbers (2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13).
4. It is the number of distinct ways that 5 objects can be arranged, which is the basis for permutations. This is known as the factorial of 5, denoted as 5! = 120.
5. It is the number of degrees in a triangle's exterior angle, which is equal to the sum of the degrees in the two interior angles.
6. It is the number of minutes in two hours.

Interesting properties of 120 include:

- It is a semiperfect number, meaning the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself) is equal to 108, which is less than 120.
- It is a member of the amicable numbers pair with 18, because the sum of the divisors of 120 is equal to the sum of the divisors of 18, and vice versa.
- It is a Harshad number in base 10, meaning the sum of its digits (1 + 2 + 0 = 3) is a multiple of its value (120) when the digits are arranged in order.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula, which is:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)

In this equation, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

x = [7 ± sqrt((-7)^2 - 4(1)(-18))] / (2(1))

x = [7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)] / 2

x = [7 ± sqrt(121)] / 2

Since the square root of 121 is 11, we have:

x = [7 ± 11] / 2

This gives us two possible solutions:

x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9

and

x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

So, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

To find out how many round trips the train can make, we first need to determine how long it takes for one trip (from one city to the other and back). Since the distance between the cities is 200 km, and the average speed is 60 km/h, the time it takes to travel one way is:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours (rounded to two decimal places)

Since the round trip is twice the distance, the time for a round trip is:

Time for round trip = 2 × Time for one way = 2 × 3.33 hours = 6.66 hours

A full day is typically 24 hours. To find out how many round trips the train can make within a full day, we divide the total available time by the time for one round trip:

Number of round trips = Total available time / Time for round trip
Number of round trips = 24 hours / 6.66 hours ≈ 3.61 round trips

Since the train cannot make a fraction of a round trip, we need to consider the whole number of round trips. The train can make 3 complete round trips within 24 hours, with the remaining 0.61 round trip being incomplete.<|im_end|>
