Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22.
The solution to this equation is x = 15/3 or approximately 5 when rounded to the nearest whole number.

Q7: What is 25% of 80?
25% of 80 is 20.

Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me?
The shopkeeper should give you a change of $20 - $15 = $5.

Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units.
The formula for finding the perimeter of a square is 4 * side length, so the perimeter is 4 * 5 = 20 units.

Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have?
Her mother has 3 children.

Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1
According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we should do division and multiplication first before addition and subtraction. So, the expression becomes 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.

Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need?
Each guest needs one slice of cake, so they need 5 slices in total.

Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price?
The sale price is $25 - ($25 * 20/100) = $25 - $5 = $20.

Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM?
There are 2 hours and 45 minutes between 3:45 PM and 6:30 PM. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, that means there are 2 * 60 + 45 = 165 minutes until 6:30 PM.

Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people?
To find out how many taxis are needed, we divide the number of people by the capacity of each taxi and round up to the nearest whole number if necessary. So, 22 / 4 = 5.5, which means that 6 taxis are needed.

Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle?
In a triangle, the sum of the measures of all three angles should be 180 degrees. So, the measure of the third angle is 180 - (31 + 62) = 87 degrees.
