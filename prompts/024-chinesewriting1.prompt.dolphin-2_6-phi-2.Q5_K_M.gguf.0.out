The first five laws of the Chinese people are:
1. A person in China will never be hungry.
2. A person in China will never be cold.
3. A person in China will never be thirsty.
4. A person in China will never be sick.
5. A person in China will never be lonely.

The first law means that the Chinese government makes sure that all its people have enough food to eat. The second law means that the government makes sure that the air is warm enough, and people can wear warm clothes. The third law means that the government makes sure that people always have clean water to drink. The fourth law means that the government makes sure that hospitals and doctors are available to help people when they are sick. The fifth law means that the government makes sure that people have friends and family to talk to, and they can always find someone to play with.

These laws show that China wants its people to have a good life, and it works hard to make sure that everyone is happy and healthy.
