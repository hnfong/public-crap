Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.


### Response:

This is a tricky question as it depends on what the user inputs for the variable `inc`. If the user inputs a negative number, the while loop will never end. For example, if the user inputs -1 for inc, then `x` will be `-inf` after one iteration and the while loop would not terminate. 

If the user input is a positive number, the while loop will keep going until it reaches infinity, which means that it will never print out "Done". However, I can't think of an example where the user inputs a negative number for inc yet the program prints out "Done". If you have any thoughts or examples on this question, please let me know.
