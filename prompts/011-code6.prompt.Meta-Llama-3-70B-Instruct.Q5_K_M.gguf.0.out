Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

No, there are no inputs that will lead to the output "Done". 

The while loop condition is `x < math.inf`, which is always True because `math.inf` is positive infinity. Therefore, the loop will run indefinitely, and the program will never reach the `print("Done")` statement.

No matter what positive or negative number you enter as input, the loop will continue to increment `x` by that number indefinitely, and the program will never terminate.

For example, if you enter `1`, the loop will keep adding `1` to `x` and will never stop. If you enter `-1`, the loop will keep subtracting `1` from `x` and will never stop. In either case, the program will never reach the `print("Done")` statement.
