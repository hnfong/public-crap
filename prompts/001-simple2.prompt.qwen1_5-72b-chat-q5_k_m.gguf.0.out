Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

A1: The number 120 has several interesting properties and significances:
1. It is a highly composite number, having more factors (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120) than any number less than it.
2. It is the smallest number with exactly 11 divisors.
3. 120 is the product of the first four positive integers (1×2×3×4 = 120), making it a tetrahedral number.
4. In base 10, it is a Harshad number, divisible by the sum of its digits (1+2+0=3, and 120 is divisible by 3).
5. In a 12-hour clock, 120 minutes equates to 2 hours.

A2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can factor the quadratic expression:

x^2 - 9x + 2x - 18 = 0
(x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions for x:

x - 9 = 0 or x + 2 = 0
x = 9 or x = -2

So, the solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

A3: To calculate the number of round trips the train can make, we first find the time it takes for a single trip.

Single Trip Time = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 10/3 hours

Since a round trip involves traveling to one city and then back, we double this time for a round trip:

Round Trip Time = 2 * (10/3) hours = 20/3 hours

Now, we have 24 hours in a full day, so we divide this by the round trip time to get the number of round trips:

Number of Round Trips = Full Day Hours / Round Trip Time = 24 / (20/3)

Number of Round Trips = 24 * 3 / 20 = 36 / 20 = 1.8

However, a train cannot make a fraction of a trip, so it can make only complete round trips. Thus, the train can make 1 full round trip within a day.
