Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

A1: The number 120 has several interesting properties:

- It is a composite number, divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and of course, 120.
- It is a highly composite number, meaning it has more factors than any number less than itself.
- It is the smallest number with exactly 10 divisors (excluding 1 and itself).
- In base 10, 120 is a Harshad number, which means it is divisible by the sum of its digits (1 + 2 + 0 = 3, and 120 is divisible by 3).
- It is also a practical number because all smaller numbers can be expressed as sums of distinct divisors of 120.
- In mathematics, 120 appears in various contexts like the number of permutations in a group of 5 elements, or the number of degrees in a full rotation.

A2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can factor the quadratic expression:

(x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us two solutions for x:

x - 9 = 0 => x = 9
x + 2 = 0 => x = -2

So, the solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

A3: To find out how many round trips a train can make within a full day, we first need to calculate the time it takes for one round trip.

The distance between the two cities is 200 km each way, so for a round trip, it's 200 km + 200 km = 400 km.
With an average speed of 60 km/h, the travel time (excluding stops) for 400 km is:

Time = Distance / Speed = 400 km / 60 km/h = 20/3 hours ≈ 6.67 hours

Assuming a full day means 24 hours, we divide this by the time for one round trip to find out how many trips it can make:

Number of round trips = 24 hours / (6.67 hours/trip) ≈ 3.59

Since the number of trips must be an integer, the train can make 3 complete round trips within a day.
