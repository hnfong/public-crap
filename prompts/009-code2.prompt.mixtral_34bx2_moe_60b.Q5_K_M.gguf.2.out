Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a file directly using at most O(log(n)) operations, we need to first load all the names from the file into memory and sort them. Then, we can use a standard binary search algorithm to find the position of the target name or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

Here's an implementation of the `binary_search_file` function that does this:
```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    # Load all names from file into a list and sort them
    with open(file_path) as f:
        names = [line.strip() for line in f]
    names.sort()

    # Use the bisect module to perform binary search on the sorted list
    return bisect.bisect_left(names, target)
```
This function first reads all lines from the input file into a list of strings (`lines`) and strips any leading or trailing whitespace from each line using `line.strip()`. It then sorts the list of names using the built-in `sorted` function. Finally, it uses the bisect module's `bisect_left` function to perform binary search on the sorted list, returning the index where the target name should be inserted (or its position in the list if already present).

Note that this implementation assumes that the file can fit into memory and has a fixed size. If the file is too large to load into memory or changes frequently, more sophisticated techniques such as using an external sorting algorithm followed by binary search may need to be used instead.
