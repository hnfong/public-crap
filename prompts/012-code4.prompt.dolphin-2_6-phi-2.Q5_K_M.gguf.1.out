What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)

The Python program prints out "Infinity". 

This is because in Python, `math.inf` is an infinitive value which stands for 'Positive Infinity' and it's a constant that represents positive infinity. The `while` loop keeps on incrementing the variable x by 1.0 but as long as x is less than `math.inf`, it will keep going. When x becomes equal to or greater than `math.inf`, the `while` condition fails, and the loop ends. At this point, x holds the value of `math.inf`. The print statement outputs "x", which in this case, is also `math.inf`.
  
However, it's important to note that in many real-world use cases where you want to count up from zero (like generating a list of numbers), using `math.inf` could lead to strange or unexpected behavior. In those cases, it's usually better to simply use a value like `0.0` and increment it manually with `x += 1.0`.
