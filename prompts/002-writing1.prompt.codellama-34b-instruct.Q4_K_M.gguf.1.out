### Response:

There was once a young girl named Sarah. She was very lonely and had no one to talk to. One day, she heard about this thing called “love”. Sarah wanted to know more about it so she looked for information in her book. She read that love was the most beautiful feeling in the world. It made her heart feel warm inside, like a cloud on a pillow.

Sarah began to exaggerate love and started thinking of how much she loved everything around her: her cat, her dog, her grandma, etc. However, Sarah realized that this was not true love. She did not truly love anything but the feeling she got from thinking about how much she loved something.

One day, Sarah met a boy named Max. They started talking and Sarah found out he was going through hard times. He was sad and had no one to talk to. Sarah felt sorry for him and wanted to help. She asked him if they could be friends. They talked and became very close friends.

As time passed, Sarah and Max became best friends. They did everything together and always made sure to check in with each other every day. Sarah realized that true love was not about feeling warm inside when you think of someone. It was about being there for the person you love no matter what and making them feel safe.

Sarah and Max were very happy. Sarah had found a true friend who loved her no matter what and she loved him too. She realized that love was not something you felt, it was something you showed to others. And because she showed it to Max, she got it back in return.
