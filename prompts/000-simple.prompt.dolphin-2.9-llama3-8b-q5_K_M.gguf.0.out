Q1: 1+1=2
Q2: 6*7=42
Q3: 83*59=4907
Q4: 349*683=237847
Q5: 60,430*7,489=? (I am not sure, but I think the answer is a large number)
Q6: 3x + 7 = 22 --> x = 5.5
Q7: 25% of 80 = 0.25 * 80 = 20
Q8: The initial payment was $40 ($20 + $20), and an additional $5 was given, making it $45. The book costs $15, so the change should be $30 ($45 - $15).
Q9: The perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units is 20 units (4 * 5)
Q10: Katherine has three siblings (2 brothers and 1 sister), so her mother has 4 children.
Q11: Evaluate the expression: 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5
Q12: Since 5 guests have arrived, they would need 5 slices of birthday cake.
Q13: The original price of the shirt is $25, and it is on sale for 20% off. So, the sale price is $25 - (0.20 * $25) = $25 - $5 = $20.
Q14: From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM, there are 2 hours and 45 minutes. So, 2*60 + 45 = 135 minutes are left.
Q15: Since a taxi can carry 4 passengers and there are 22 people, we need 6 taxis (22 รท 4 = 5.5, rounded up to 6).
Q16: In a triangle, the sum of the angles is always 180 degrees. So, the third angle can be found by subtracting the sum of the two given angles (31 + 62) from 180, which is 87 degrees.<|im_end|>
