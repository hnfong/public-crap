What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)

<|im_start|>assistant
 The eventual output will be `math.inf` because the while loop continues to increment x by 1.0 until it reaches infinity, which is represented by math.inf in Python. So when the program prints x, it will print math.inf.
