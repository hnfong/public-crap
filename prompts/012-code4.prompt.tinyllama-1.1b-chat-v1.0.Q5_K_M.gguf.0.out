 <|im_start|>user
What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The program in the question above prompts the user to input a real number and calculates its sum using the built-in math module function. The user's input is stored in the variable x, and the while loop continues until x equals math.inf. The loop then prints the sum of x, which is computed using the addition operator (+). The program outputs the final sum of x.
