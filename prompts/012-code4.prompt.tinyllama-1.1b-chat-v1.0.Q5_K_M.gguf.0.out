What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The eventual output of the following Python program is:

```python
import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
    print(x)
```

Here, the program starts by setting `x` to a value of `0.0`, then iterates using a loop condition that ensures that `x` is greater than or equal to the current value of `math.inf`. The program continues until `x` equals `math.inf`, and finally prints the final `x` value, which represents the result of the iteration process.
