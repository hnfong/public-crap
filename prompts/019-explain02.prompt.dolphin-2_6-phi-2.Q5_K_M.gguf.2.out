Explain the role of China's National People Congress to a 5 year old child who lives in London.

The National People's Congress (NPC) is like a big group of people who make important decisions for a country, called China. Imagine if your class had to decide what games you will play during break time or when to have a picnic. You all would talk together and vote on the best idea, right? That's similar to what the NPC does! 

In London, you are in another big city with lots of people who also have their own rules and leaders. However, both your school class and the NPC are like groups where everyone shares their ideas and works together for the good of all. They talk about how to make things better, like schools, hospitals or roads, and decide on laws that everybody in the country must follow. So, even though you live far away in London, China's big group called the National People's Congress is still doing important work for their people.
