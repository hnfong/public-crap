Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.


### Response:

Yo, listen up, I got a story to tell,
About this crew called the Federal Reserve, they ringing your bell.
They ain't rappers, but they control the dough,
Making sure the economy don't sink low.

They set interest rates on loans and such,
Keeping inflation in check, that's their clutch.
When the economy's struggling, they lower the rate,
So people can borrow and invest without hate.

But if prices start to rise too fast,
They raise the rate, making cash a blast from the past.
They also regulate banks, keeping them in line,
Making sure they follow the rules, all the time.

And when things get really rough, like a financial storm,
They're the first responders, ready to perform.
They can print more money or provide liquidity,
To keep the economy from fatality.

So that's the Federal Reserve in a nutshell,
Working hard so our pockets don't smell.
They might not be on your playlist or in your crew,
But they're keeping the green flowing, that's true.
