Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties and significance:
1. It is an even number (0 mod 2 = 0) because its last digit is 0.
2. It is divisible by 6 (6 * 20 = 120).
3. It is a square number, as it can be represented as 10^2 or 12^2.
4. Its prime factors are 2, 2, 3, and 5 (2^3 * 3 * 5).
5. It has the form 120 + 30 + 6 + 1, which is a special property of numbers that ends with 1, called "unit digit properties." In this case, it is also divisible by 8 (8 * 15 = 120).
6. Its double factorial (the product of all odd integers up to 120) is 12, which is the smallest prime number greater than 4.

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can follow these steps:
1. Factorize the quadratic expression: (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0.
2. Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x: 
   a) x - 9 = 0 => x = 9
   b) x + 2 = 0 => x = -2
3. The solutions are x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: To find out how many round trips a train can make between two cities within a full day, we need to consider the time spent traveling and not in between. A round trip consists of traveling from one city to another and back. We know that the average speed is 60 km/h, and the distance between the two cities is 200 km.
1. Calculate the total travel time for a single round trip: Travel time = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h ≈ 3.33 hours.
2. Since there are 24 hours in a day, we can find out how many hours are not spent traveling by subtracting the travel time from the total number of hours in a day: Hours not traveled = Total hours - Travel time = 24 - 3.33 ≈ 20.67 hours.
3. Divide the number of hours not traveled by the round trip duration to get the number of round trips within a full day: Number of round trips = Hours not traveled / Round trip duration = 20.67 hours / 3.33 hours ≈ 6 round trips.
