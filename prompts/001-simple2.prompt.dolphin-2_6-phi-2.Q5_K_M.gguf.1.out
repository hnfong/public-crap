Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

A1: The number 120 is significant because it is divisible by all numbers from 1 to 10 (120 = 2^2 * 3 * 5). It is also called the "perfect number" because its proper divisors sum up to 120, which makes it a special kind of integer. Some interesting properties of 120 include being an even perfect number and having a square root that is not a whole number.

A2: To solve x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:

x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

x = (7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4 * 1 * (-18))) / (2 * 1)
x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± √121) / 2
x = (7 ± 11) / 2

This gives us two solutions:

x1 = (7 + 11) / 2 = 18 / 2 = 9
x2 = (7 - 11) / 2 = -4 / 2 = -2

So the solution to the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 is x = 9 and x = -2.

A3: To find how many round trips a train can make in a full day, we first need to determine its total travel time for one round trip. The distance between two cities is 200 km, and the train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h. Therefore, the time taken for one round trip is:

Time = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 10/3 hours

Since a full day has 24 hours, we can calculate how many times the train can make a round trip in a full day as follows:

Number of trips = Total time available / Time per trip = 24 hours / (10/3) hours ≈ 7.2 trips

However, since it is not possible to make a fraction of a trip, the train can only make 7 round trips within a full day.
