Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

 Yes, there are inputs that will lead to the output "Done". Here are two examples:

1. Input: `0.5`
   In this case, the loop will continue adding `0.5` to `x` each iteration until it reaches infinity. Since it takes an infinite number of iterations for `x` to reach infinity, the program will never print "Done". However, if you forcefully terminate the program (e.g., by closing the terminal or stopping the execution), the output will be "Done" as the last message before the program terminates.

2. Input: `-1`
   In this case, the loop will continue subtracting `1.0` from `x` each iteration until it reaches negative infinity. However, since it takes an infinite number of iterations for `x` to reach negative infinity, the program will never print "Done". Similar to the previous example, if you forcefully terminate the program (e.g., by closing the terminal or stopping the execution), the output will be "Done" as the last message before the program terminates.

Note that there are no inputs for which the loop will naturally end in a finite number of iterations without modifying the code, since `x` will always approach infinity or negative infinity for any positive or negative value inputted.
