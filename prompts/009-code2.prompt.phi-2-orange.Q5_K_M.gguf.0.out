Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search directly on a text file with names sorted lexicographically, you can read the file line by line and convert each line into a list of characters. This will allow us to treat each character as an integer value for comparison purposes. The target search will then be performed using this numeric representation, which is more efficient than searching in strings or lists directly since it reduces the complexity from O(n) to O(log n).

To achieve this with at most `O(log(n))` operations, we can modify the binary search algorithm as follows:

1. Read all lines of the file and store them in a list (each character in the line is considered as an integer value by treating it as ASCII value minus 'A' + 1).
2. Perform binary search on this list using the `bisect` module from Python's standard library or write your own implementation with at most two passes, each of which takes O(log n) time.
3. If a match is found in one pass, return its index directly as the position of the target character in the original text file. If no match is found in one pass, find the insertion point (`bisect_left` operation) for the target character. The first element after this insertion point will be the next line in the file where the target could potentially appear, and thus its index in the list can be returned directly.
4. Continue iterating through the lines until a match or insertion point is found.
5. If a match is found, return its position as the corresponding line number by adding the current line number to the offset due to the start of each line (which is `i * (len(chars[0]) + 1)`, where `i` is the current line number). If no match is found after iterating through all lines, return -1.

Here's a Python function implementing this approach:

```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        chars = [list(map(lambda c: ord(c) - ord('A') + 1, line.strip())) for i, line in enumerate(f)]
        i = bisect.bisect_left([char[0] for char in chars], target)
        while i < len(chars):
            if chars[i][0] == target:
                return i * (len(chars[0]) + 1) + list(map(lambda c: ord(c) - ord('A') + 1, chars[i].pop(0)))[0]
            elif chars[i][0] > target:
                target = chars[i][bisect.bisect_left([char[0] for char in chars[i:]], target)]
                i = bisect.bisect_left([char[0] for char in chars[:i]], target) + i
            else:
                break
        return -1
```

This function reads the file line by line, converts each character into an integer value, and then performs a binary search to find the target. If found, it returns the position of the target character in the original text file as the first element after the insertion point (which is the next line where the target could potentially appear). If no match is found, it returns -1.
