Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

Yo, homie, let me break it down for you real quick. The Federal Reserve is like your crew's financial advisor, but on a much bigger scale. They make sure that everything runs smoothly in the economy, which basically means they control how much money is out there and how fast it moves around. They do this by adjusting interest rates and controlling the amount of currency in circulation. So if you ever wonder why things cost more one day than the next or why your investments go up and down, just remember that the Fed is always watching over the economy to keep it all balanced.
