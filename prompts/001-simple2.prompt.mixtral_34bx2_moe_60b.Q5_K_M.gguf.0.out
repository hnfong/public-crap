Answers for all these questions are as follows:

Q1: The significance of the number 120 and some of its interesting properties include:
- It's the smallest number divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. This makes it a highly composite number.
- It is the product of the first 4 positive integers (1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24). So, in some ways, it's a "basic" product of early numbers.
- It has notable divisibility properties. For instance, all multiples of 120 are evenly divisible by 5 and 6, and many other smaller numbers.
- From the perspective of mathematics history, the number 120 plays an important role in geometry. In fact, a regular dodecahedron (a three-dimensional shape with twelve faces) has 12 vertices, each connected to 3 others by edges, for a total of 48 connections. And since a dodecahedron has 20 faces, it's clear that the number of connections is twice the number of faces - which just happens to be 120.
- It is also the sum of two cubes in two different ways: 5^3 + 1 = 121 and 4^3 − 1 = 64 − 1 = 63, so their sum equals 121 + 63 = 184, which equals 120.

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 using factoring, we are looking for two numbers that multiply to equal -18 and add up to -7. The pair of integers satisfying this is -9 and 2. So, we can factor the quadratic expression as (x-9)(x+2). Setting each factor to zero gives us x = 9 or x = -2, so our solution for the equation is x = 9 or x = -2.

Q3: The time it takes for one trip between the two cities is given by the distance over speed which equals 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours (rounding up to account for station time). So, within a full day of 24 hours, a train can make 7 trips: 24 hours / 3.33 hours per trip gives approximately 7 trips. It's important to note that round-trips are counted separately from one-way trips. Therefore, the number of round trips is half of this value which is 3.5. Since we can't make a half of a train journey, the number of possible full round trips in a day would be 3.
