Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

 To perform a binary search on a file directly, we need to read and parse the text file line by line. We can use Python's built-in `bisect` module to achieve this with O(log n) time complexity. Here's an example implementation:

1. Read the input file and split it into lines containing names.
2. Use the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the position of the target name within the list of names, or the insertion point if the name is not present.
3. Return the index of the found name or the insertion point.

Here's a sample Python implementation:

```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        names = [line.strip() for line in file]
        
    try:
        index = bisect.bisect_left(names, target)
        
    except ValueError:
        # Target name is not present in the list of names
        index = bisect.bisect_right(names, target) - 1
            
    return index
```

This implementation assumes that the input file has only one name per line and no duplicate names are allowed. If you have duplicates or more complex data structures in your file, you may need to modify this approach accordingly.<|im_end|>
