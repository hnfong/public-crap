 

### Instruction:

Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.


### Response:

No, this program will not output "Done" for any input because the loop is infinite and will continue running until an overflow occurs (if no exception is raised before then). This happens because the loop increments x by inc indefinitely without checking whether it has reached math.inf or exceeded it. Therefore, the loop will never terminate.
