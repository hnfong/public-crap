1+1=2
6*7=42
83*59=5067
349*683=234227
6443*7489=45479929
To solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22
Subtract 7 from both sides: 3x = 15
Divide by 3 on both sides: x = 5
25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20
The shopkeeper should give me $5 in change. The total amount I gave her was 2 * $20 + $5 = $45, and the cost of the book was $15. So she needs to return $45 - $15 = $30.
To find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units: 4 * 5 = 20 units
Katherine's mother has 2 brothers + 1 sister + Katherine = 4 children in total.
Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1
First, do the division: 12 รท 4 = 3
Now add and subtract from left to right: 3 + 3 - 1 = 5
Tom and his five guests need 6 slices of birthday cake (since each guest needs at least one slice).
A shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, so the discount amount is 0.20 * $25 = $5. The sale price is then $25 - $5 = $20.
There are 3 hours left until 6:30 PM, which is equal to 3 * 60 + 30 minutes = 180 minutes + 30 minutes = 210 minutes. So there are 210 minutes - 135 minutes (since it's 3:45 PM) = 75 minutes left.
A taxi can carry 4 passengers, so for a group of 22 people, they would need 22 / 4 = 5.5 taxis. Since you cannot have half a taxi, you would need 6 taxis in total.
The sum of two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees is 31 + 62 = 93 degrees. The measure of the third angle would be 180 - 93 = 87 degrees.
