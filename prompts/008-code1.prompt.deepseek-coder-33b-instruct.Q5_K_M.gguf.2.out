### Instruction:

Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.


### Response:

Here is the Python implementation of Bubble Sort:

```python
def bubbleSort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n-1):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
```

Here is the Python implementation of Merge Sort:

```python
def mergeSort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        mid = len(arr)//2
        Left_half = arr[:mid]
        Right_half = arr[mid:]
        
        mergeSort(Left_half)
        mergeSort(Right_half)
        
        i = 0
        j = 0
        k = 0
        
        while i < len(Left_half) and j < len(Right_half):
            if Left_half[i] < Right_half[j]:
                arr[k] = Left_half[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = Right_half[j]
                j += 1
                
            k += 1
        
        while i < len(Left_half):
            arr[k] = Left_half[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1
            
        while j < len(Right_half):
            arr[k] = Right_half[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
```

Discussion:

Bubble Sort and Merge Sort are both comparison-based sorting algorithms. However, they differ in their approach to the problem. Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no more swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted. It has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of items being sorted. This makes it inefficient for large data sets.

Merge Sort on the other hand uses the divide and conquer strategy. It works by recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems until they become simple enough to be solved directly, then combines their solutions back together to solve the original problem. Merge sort's time complexity is O(n log n) which makes it much more efficient for large datasets compared to bubble sort. However, its primary disadvantage is that it requires additional space in memory to store sub-arrays and thus has a higher space complexity of O(n).

Comparisons:

1. Bubble Sort vs Merge Sort: Merge sort's time complexity is always better than bubble sort's but if you prefer code simplicity, then bubble sort is the right choice because it requires less lines of code. But for large data sets, merge sort would be more efficient.

2. Bubble Sort vs Selection Sort: Both are simple algorithms and both require O(n^2) time to solve. However, bubble sort performs significantly better than selection sort due to fewer swaps in bubble sort (i.e., it is a 'swap heavy' algorithm while selection sort is a 'comparison heavy' algorithm).

3. Bubble Sort vs Quick Sort: Both have an average time complexity of O(n log n) but, quick sort has a better worst-case scenario which is more practical in real world scenarios whereas bubble sort performs well even for large datasets as it requires lesser number of comparisons and swaps.

4. Bubble Sort vs Insertion Sort: Both algorithms have a time complexity of O(n^2), but insertion sort works better than bubble sort in practice because it's more efficient with nearly sorted or small datasets, while bubble sort is less efficient for such cases. 

In conclusion, the choice between these two algorithms depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand (such as size of data set and stability), and there isn't a generally 'better' algorithm to choose due to their unique properties.
