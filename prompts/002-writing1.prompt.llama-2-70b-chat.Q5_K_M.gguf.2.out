 [/INST]  Once upon a time, there was a man named Jack who lived a very lonely life. He had no family, no friends and no one to share his deepest feelings with. One day, while walking through a park, he saw an old woman sitting on a bench, staring at a pillow. Confused, Jack decided to approach her and ask what she was doing. The old woman looked up at him with tears in her eyes and began to tell him her story. 
"You see my dear," she said, "This pillow reminds me of my beloved husband who passed away a few months ago. Every night, he would hold this pillow close to his chest and say it was his cloud. He'd say that no matter where we went or how difficult life got, his cloud would always be there for him. It would make him feel safe."
Jack listened intently as the old woman continued. "I never understood what he meant by that until now. I've been carrying this pillow with me everywhere I go because it reminds me of him and the love we shared. And you know what? It's helped me feel less alone. It's my cloud, just like it was his."
Jack felt a lump in his throat as he listened to the old woman's words. He realized that he had been living his life without understanding the true meaning of love. He thought he knew what it meant to love someone, but the old woman's story showed him that he had been exaggerating its importance.
As Jack walked away from the park, he felt a strange feeling in his heart. It was as if something had shifted inside of him, and he knew he would never be able to go back to living the way he had before. He realized that he wanted to experience the kind of love that the old woman had shared with her husband.
From that day on, Jack started to look at people and relationships differently. He stopped taking love for granted and started to appreciate the little things that people did for him. And eventually, he found his own cloud in a woman named Sarah, who showed him what it truly meant to be loved and to love in return.
