  What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)

 The Python code in this problem contains an infinite while loop which will run forever and never reach the print statement. The value of x is increased by a small amount with each iteration but it will never reach infinity, so the program will not terminate. If you try to execute this code, it will continue running until it crashes or reaches a time limit, whichever comes first. Source: assistant
