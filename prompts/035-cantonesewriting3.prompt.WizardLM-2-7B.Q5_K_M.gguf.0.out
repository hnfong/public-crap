ASSISTANT: 當然可以！以下是使用「暗諷」這個概念的10句廣東話例句，以及它們的英文翻譯：

1. 他表面上嘅「唔係諷人」，冇人知道咫最會暗算。 (He seems not to be a jester, but everyone knows he's actually the best at making subtle jabs.)
   英文: He appears not to be a jester, but everyone knows he's actually the best at subtle jibes.

2. 她問你咗事，係正經嘅問題，唔係咀咫暗諷。 (When she asks you something, it's a legitimate question, not an indirect dig at you.)
   英文: When she asks you a question, it's a sincere inquiry, not a subtle jab at you.

3. 你嫌他嘅「唔懂事」，其實佢喺暗示你嘅不夠耐心。 (You think he's naive, but he's actually subtly pointing out your lack of patience.)
   英文: You think he's naive, but he's actually subtly hinting at your lack of patience.

4. 佢嘅話話「我唔係負諷你」，冇人同感，你唔得諗。 (His way of saying "I'm not insulting you" leaves everyone with the same feeling, you just can't put it into words.)
   英文: His way of saying "I'm not insulting you" resonates with everyone, you just can't articulate it.

5. 彫幫你，係正嘅「好人」行為，佢其實喺暗示你嘫獨自。 (Helping you is a good deed, but he's actually subtly suggesting that you're acting alone.)
   英文: Helping you is a kind act, but he's actually subtly indicating that you're acting independently.

6. 唔要諗彫嘅「唔必須答問」，冇人諗到你喺背嘅「答得也竟唔太好」。 (Don't take it personally when he says "you don't have to answer," everyone can see that your answer was both necessary and not quite right.)
   英文: Don't take it personally when he says "you don't have to answer," everyone can see that your answer was both required and not entirely satisfactory.

7. 佢嘅「我喺正經嘅談話」，其實係喺暗示嘅你喫咗話多啲不切實際。 (When he says he's speaking seriously, he's actually subtly implying that you've said a lot of impractical things.)

8. 她嘅「我唔係諗你」，冇人同意，你係喫咗事多啲諸如。 (When she says she's not jabbing at you, everyone agrees, considering all that you've done.)
   英文: When she says she's not jabbing at you, everyone agrees, considering all that you've done.

9. 你嘅「我同唔同」，其實俾你喫咗「我同同」啲話同啲，唔係咁明顯嘅暗諷。 (Your "I'm neither with you nor against you" is actually a subtle way of saying "I'm completely with you," it's not as obvious as a direct jab.)
   英文: Your "I'm neither with you nor against you" is actually a subtle way of saying "I'm completely with you," it's not as obvious as a direct jab.
