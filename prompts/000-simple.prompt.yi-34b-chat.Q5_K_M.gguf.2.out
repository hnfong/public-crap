Q1: 1 + 1 = 2
Q2: 6 * 7 = 42
Q3: 83 * 59 = 4897
Q4: 349 * 683 = 238737
Q5: 6043 * 7489 = 4535327
Q6: Solve the equation: 3x + 7 = 22. I am not sure, but I think the answer is x = 6
Q7: What is 25% of 80? 0.25 * 80 = 20
Q8: I buy a book that costs $15. I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, but she does not have exact change. So I give her a an additional five dollar bill. What is the final change the shopkeeper should give me? The initial payment would be 2 * $20 + $5 = $45
However, since the book costs $15, the shopkeeper should give you back the difference: $45 - $15 = $30 in change.
Q9: Find the perimeter of a square with a side length of 5 units. Perimeter of a square is given by P = 4 * side length. So for a side length of 5 units, the perimeter would be P = 4 * 5 = 20 units.
Q10: Katherine has two brothers and a sister. How many children does her mother have? Since Katherine has two brothers and a sister, there are three siblings in total (including Katherine).
Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1. 3 + (12 รท 4) - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5
Q12: Tom is holding a birthday party. 5 guests have arrived. How many slices of birthday cake do they need? The number of slices needed is not specified, but assuming each guest gets one slice, and there are 5 guests, you would need 5 slices of cake.
Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, what is the sale price? The discount amount would be 20% of the original price: 0.20 * $25 = $5
So the sale price would be the original price minus the discount: $25 - $5 = $20
Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, how many minutes are left until 6:30 PM? There are (6:30 PM - 3:45 PM) = (6 hours + 30 minutes) - (3 hours + 45 minutes) = 2 hours and 45 minutes.
Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. How many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people? To find out how many taxis are needed, you divide the number of people by the capacity of each taxi: 22 people / 4 passengers per taxi = 5.5
Since you can't have half a taxi, you would need 6 taxis to accommodate 22 passengers, with one taxi carrying only two passengers (assuming no other taxis are available).
Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, what is the measure of the third angle? The sum of the three angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees. So if we have two angles that add up to 93 degrees (31 + 62), then the third angle must be 180 - 93 = 87 degrees.<|im_end|>

Please note that for some of these questions, especially those involving calculations with large numbers or complex equations, it's always good to double-check your work. If you are unsure about a particular answer, feel free to use a calculator or consult the relevant formulas and rules.<|im_end|>
