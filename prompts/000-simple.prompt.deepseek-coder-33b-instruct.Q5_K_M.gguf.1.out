### Response:

Q1: 1+1=2
Q2: 6*7=42
Q3: 83*59=4907
Q4: 349*683=236747
Q5: 6043*7489=45,491,787
Q6: Solve the equation: x = (22 - 7) / 3. The answer is 5.
Q7: 25% of 80 = 20
Q8: I give the shopkeeper a five dollar bill. So, her change to me should be $14, which means she owes me 6 dollars ($20 - $14) and one twenty-dollar bill. The total change is therefore 6 + 20 = $26.
Q9: Perimeter of a square with side length 5 units is: 5*4 = 20 units
Q10: A mother has 3 children, so if Katherine has two brothers and a sister, the mother would have 3+3=6 children.
Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + (12 * 4) - 1 = 15 + 48 - 1 = 62
Q12: A birthday party will need slices of cake for each guest, so with 5 guests they would need 5*8 = 40 slices.
Q13: The original price is $25 and a discount of 20% equals $25 * .20 = $5. So the sale price is $25 - $5 = $20.
Q14: There are 7 hours (15 minutes) until 6 PM, which means there are 450 minutes left. To get to 6:30 PM from 3:45 PM, there are 390 minutes. So, the remaining time is 450 - 390 = 60 minutes.
Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. With 22 people, 22 / 4 = 5.75 taxis are needed. Since you cannot have a fraction of a taxi, round up to the next whole number: 6 taxis are needed.
Q16: The measure of the third angle in a triangle where two angles are 31 and 62 degrees is 107.
