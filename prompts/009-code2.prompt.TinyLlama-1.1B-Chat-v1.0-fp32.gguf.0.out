Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a file, we can use the `bisect_left` function provided by the `bisect` module. This function works by dividing the search space into two halves and repeatedly bisecting each half until the target is found.

Here's a Python function that implements the `bisect_left` function to perform a binary search on a file:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path) as f:
        data = f.readlines()

    n = len(data)
    left = 0
    right = n - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if data[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif data[mid] > target:
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1

    # If no match was found, the target is not in the file
    return -1
```

This function takes a file path and a target value as input, and returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To use this function, simply call it on the file path and target value:

```python
target = 3
file_path = "file.txt"
result = binary_search_file(file_path, target)
if result == -1:
    print("Target not found.")
else:
    print("Target at position", result)
```

In this example, we use the `file_path` and `target` as input, and the binary search function returns the insertion point (as in "bisect_left") and prints the result.</s>
