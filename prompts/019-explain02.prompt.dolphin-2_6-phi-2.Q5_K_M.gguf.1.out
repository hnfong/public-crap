The National People's Congress is like the big boss of a really big country called China. Just like how your parents make decisions for your family, this group makes important decisions for the whole country and all the people living there. Imagine if everyone in your town came together to talk about what rules they want to make - that would be kind of like what the National People's Congress does, but with even more people and bigger choices! They help decide things like how the country will grow, how much money people should have, and many other important issues. This group is made up of lots of different people from all around China, just like your school has different kids who all work together to make learning fun. That's what the National People's Congress does - they help make sure that everyone in China is happy and safe, and that the country keeps getting better every day.
