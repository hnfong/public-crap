Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

 The given text file contains names sorted in lexicographical order. To perform a binary search on the file directly using at most O(log(n)) operations, we can use the `sorted` function to sort the list of names. After sorting, we can use a while loop and the bisect_left function from the bisect module in Python to find the target index.

Here's how you can implement the binary search function:

```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path) as file:
        for i, line in enumerate(file, 1):
            if line == target:
                return i - 1
        # Target not found in the list
        return bisect.bisect_left(file, target, start=0)
```

This function opens a file specified by `file_path` and reads each line to get the sorted names. It then checks if the target is present at the current index (i) using the `bisect_left` method from the bisect module. If it's not found, the function returns the position of the insertion point (as in "bisect_left"). Otherwise, it searches for the target from the next line and keeps updating the position until it finds the target or reaches the end of the file.<|im_end|>
