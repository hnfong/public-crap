Here's your answer for Q1: The number 120 has no fixed meaning in mathematics. However, it is significant because it is an irrational number, which means that its digits cannot be represented as decimal fractions of a whole number. For example, the square root of 120 is also an irrational number, but it can be represented as a decimal fraction.

For Q2, we can solve for x using the quadratic formula:
x = (-7/2) - (-18/6) / 7 = -5/3

So, the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 has only one real root. So, the number 120 is a positive integer.

For Q3: Assume that two trains travel at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. The time taken for each round trip can be calculated using the formula:
t = (x + y) / 2
where x and y are the distances from the starting city to the end city, and t is the number of days required to complete the journey. In our case, we have two cities and 1 day between them, so the distance between the two cities is 200km. So, t = (x + y) / 2 = (60 + 8) / 2 = 54 hours and minutes. This means that the number of round trips required is:
n = 1/((60+8)/(54hmin)) = 2/200
so, n=2.

So, we can expect to complete one round trip within a full day.
