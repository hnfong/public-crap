  What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
  Source: assistant

 The output of this Python program will be "inf" because the value of x keeps increasing in each iteration of the while loop, and it'll never reach a point where x < math.inf is no longer true. Therefore, the print statement will not execute, and the loop will continue running forever.  Source: assistant
