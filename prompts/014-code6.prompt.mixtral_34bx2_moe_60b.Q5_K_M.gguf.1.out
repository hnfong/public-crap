Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Yes, there are inputs that can lead to the output "Done" in this program. Any non-negative number entered as input will cause the loop to continue until x reaches infinity. Here are two examples:

1. Input: 0 (zero): In this case, `inc` is assigned the value of 0 and since it is a non-negative number, the loop continues indefinitely, incrementing `x` by 0 at each iteration until `x` reaches infinity. The output will be "Done" after an infinite number of iterations.

2. Input: 1 (one): Here, `inc` is assigned the value of 1 and since it is a non-negative number, the loop continues indefinitely incrementing `x` by 1 at each iteration until `x` reaches infinity. The output will be "Done" after an infinite number of iterations.
