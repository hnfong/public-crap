Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

We will use a binary search to perform this operation as it is efficient for large data sets and has an average time complexity of O(log n).

However, the challenge here lies in performing this operation on a file. We can read each line from the file into memory, sort them (in lexicographical order), and then iterate through the list to find our target. But doing this would result in a linear time complexity, which is not optimal given that we are aiming for at most O(log n) operations. 

A more efficient approach would be to use an iterator or generator to read the file line by line without loading all lines into memory. This way, we can iterate through the sorted lines in a binary search-like manner, comparing each line with the target until we find it or determine its insertion point (in "bisect_left").

Here's a Python function that achieves this:

```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        lines = sorted([line.strip() for line in file])
        index = bisect.bisect_left(lines, target)

        if index and lines[index] == target:
            return index
        elif index < len(lines):
            return index if lines[index] > target else index + 1
        else:
            return None
```
In this function:

- We open the file in read mode and read each line. We strip any leading or trailing whitespaces from the lines using `strip()`.
- The list of sorted lines is created using a list comprehension. 
- Using `bisect_left`, we find the insertion point for the target in this list. If `target` is present, it will return its index. If not, it will return either less than or equal to the length of the list (if the target is greater), or more than the length of the list (if the target is smaller).
- We then check if our found index and the value at that index are equal to the target. If they are, we return the index. Otherwise, we check whether the value at the found index is greater than the target. If it is, we return the insertion point. If not, we return None as our search has been unsuccessful.

Please note that this function assumes each line in your file only contains a single name with no spaces or special characters. Also, it assumes the file does not contain any empty lines and all names are sorted lexicographically. If these assumptions do not hold true for your specific case, you will need to adjust the function accordingly.
