### Instruction:

Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.


### Response:

Here's a Python implementation for both Bubble Sort and Merge Sort:

Bubble Sort:
```python
def bubble_sort(list):
    for i in range(len(list) - 1, 0, -1):
        for j in range(i):
            if list[j] > list[j + 1]:
                temp = list[j]
                list[j] = list[j + 1]
                list[j + 1] = temp
    return list
```
Merge Sort:
```python
def merge_sort(list):
    if len(list) <= 1:  # base case
        return list
    
    midpoint = int(len(list) / 2)
    left, right = merge_sort(list[:midpoint]), merge_sort(list[midpoint:])

    return merge(left, right)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    
    while len(left) != 0 and len(right) != 0:
        if left[0] < right[0]:
            result.append(left.pop(0))
            
        else: 
            result.append(right.pop(0))

    # append what's left in either list
    while len(left) != 0:
        result.append(left.pop(0))
    
    while len(right) != 0:
        result.append(right.pop(0))
        
    return result
```

Both sorting algorithms work by rearranging the positions of elements in a list to put them in an order, but they do it slightly differently. 

Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted.

Merge sort takes a different approach. It divides the unsorted list into N sublists (each with one element), then repeatedly merges these sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list. 

The main difference between the two algorithms lies in their computational complexity and efficiency: Bubble sort has a worst-case and average time complexity of O(n^2), making it inefficient for large lists, whereas merge sort has a time complexity of O(N log N) regardless of the input list. 

Merge sort also uses extra space proportional to the size of the input which can be an issue when dealing with larger data sets. Bubble Sort is simple and requires no additional memory apart from a few variables, making it more space efficient for large lists.

In conclusion, both algorithms have their unique advantages and disadvantages, and one might be preferred over another depending on specific conditions or requirements of the problem at hand.
