Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties. One of its most notable properties is that it is a perfect multiple of 12. It can be divided evenly by 12, with the result being a whole number (120 / 12 = 10). Additionally, 120 is a square number, as 12 * 12 = 144, and 120 is the first perfect square that is also divisible by 12.

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can factor it or use the quadratic formula. Factoring, we get (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0. Solving for x, we find two solutions: x = 9 and x = -2.

Q3: To calculate the number of round trips a train can make between two cities within a full day, we need to determine how long it takes for one round trip. First, we find the time it takes to travel one way: distance / speed = 200km / 60km/h = 10/3 hours. Since the train can travel in either direction, it can make two one-way trips in a day (assuming 24 hours). Thus, the number of round trips can be calculated as (2 one-way trips) * (1 round trip per one-way trip) = 2 round trips.<|im_end|>
