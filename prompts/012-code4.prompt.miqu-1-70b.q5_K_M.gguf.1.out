What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)


### Response:

The code will result in an infinite loop because it's impossible for a finite floating-point number to equal `math.inf` (positive infinity). The `print(x)` statement will never be reached, and no output will be produced.
