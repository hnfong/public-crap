The Chinese National People's Congress is like a big meeting where people from all over China come together to talk about important things for their country, just like how you and your friends discuss fun stuff at playtime! They make decisions on rules and laws that everyone in China should follow. It helps keep everything running smoothly and safely so the Chinese can live happily ever after!
