The question is about the early life of Chinese emperors, including their childhood and education. In Chinese history, there were several notable individuals who became emperor during their childhood or early youth. These rulers achieved power at a young age, often through political maneuvering and the support of their families. Their upbringing, education, and early experiences shaped them into capable leaders who would go on to rule for many years. Here are some examples of Chinese emperors who started their careers in their childhood:

1. Emperor Qin Shi Huang (221-210 BCE): He was born in 210 BCE in the State of Shu Han as Ying Zheng. At the age of 14, he was appointed Crown Prince and then King of Qin after his father's death. In 221 BCE, he declared himself the first emperor of China and established a centralized government.

2. Emperor Wu of Jin (265-280 CE): Born in 265 CE in the State of Eastern Wei, he was the fourth son of Sima Zhao, a powerful military general who later became regent for Emperor Hui. When Emperor Hui died without any surviving male heirs, Emperor Wu ascended to the throne at just 16 years old and ruled as Emperor Wu of Jin until his death at 27.

3. Emperor Taizu of Song (960-976 CE): Born in 960 CE in the state of Cai Prefecture, he was a descendant of the Zhou Dynasty royal family through his mother, Lady Feng. After the collapse of the Tang Dynasty, Emperor Taizu led the Song Dynasty to victory and established himself as the emperor at just 10 years old.

4. Emperor Gaozu of Tang (619-649 CE): He was born in 619 CE in the State of Yan, a tributary state of the Sui Dynasty. After Emperor Yang's death, his uncle Li Shimin seized power and established the Tang Dynasty. In 630 CE, at just 11 years old, he became emperor, marking the beginning of the Tang Dynasty.

5. Emperor Renzong of Song (1079-1125 CE): Born in 1079 CE, he was a posthumous name given to Emperor Huizong when he ascended the throne as the emperor of the Song Dynasty. He ruled from 1101 until his death at just 26 years old.

These are just a few examples of Chinese emperors who began their careers during their childhood or early youth. Their early experiences and education played a crucial role in shaping them into strong leaders who would go on to rule over vast empires for many years.
