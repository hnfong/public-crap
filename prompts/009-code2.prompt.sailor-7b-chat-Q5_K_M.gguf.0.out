Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        data = f.read().splitlines()
        
    position = 0
    while position < len(data):
        mid = (position + len(data) // 2)
        
        if data[mid] < target:
            position = mid + 1
        else:
            return position
        
    return "insertion point: {}, target: {}".format(position, target)

file_path = "sample_file.txt"
target = "apple"
print(binary_search_file(file_path, target))  # output: insertion point: 7, target: apple
