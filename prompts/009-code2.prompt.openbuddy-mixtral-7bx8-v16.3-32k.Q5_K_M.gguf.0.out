Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a text file directly using O(log(n)) operations, we need to design an algorithm that doesn't require loading the entire contents of the file into memory. Instead, we can use buffered reading and processing techniques to achieve this goal. Here is a high-level overview:

1. Open the input file (`file_path`) in binary mode for reading.
2. Read the first line from the file, which represents an element of our search space. We'll call it `start`.
3. Find the middle point between `start` and `target`, considering the lexicographical order:
   - If `start <= target`, set a new start index (`middle_index`) by calculating `(end_position + start_index) / 2`.
   - Otherwise, set `middle_index = end_position`, as we know that all elements after the current line are greater than or equal to `target`.
4. Read and compare lines around `middle_index` until you find a suitable position for `target` (if it exists in the file).
5. If the target is found, return its position. Otherwise, return the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").
6. Close the input file.

Here's a Python function that implements this algorithm:
```python
import os

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:  # Open in binary mode
        start = b''  # Initialize the first line buffer
        end_index = -1
        current_line_index = 0
        
        while True:
            byte = f.read(1)  # Read one byte at a time
            
            if not byte:
                break  # Reached EOF, exit the loop
            
            if byte == b'\n':
                current_line = start + byte  # Add newline character to end of line buffer
                yield current_line.decode('utf-8')  # Yield the decoded line as a string
                
                target_byte_index = binary_search(start, b'\n', target)  # Perform binary search on bytes
                if target_byte_index < len(current_line):
                    return current_line_index + target_byte_index  # Found the target or insertion point
                
                start = byte  # Update start index for next iteration
            else:
                start += byte  # Add bytes to line buffer if not a newline character
            
            end_index += len(byte)  # Keep track of current position in the file
            current_line_index += 1
```
This implementation assumes that the input text file is encoded in UTF-8. It reads and processes one byte at a time, updating the line buffer as necessary. The `binary_search()` function performs a binary search on bytes to find the position of the target or insertion point within the current line buffer.

To use this function for your specific task, you can define an appropriate `binary_search()` implementation that handles byte comparisons and returns the correct index when found or if not present in the file:
```python
def binary_search(start, end, target):
    start = 0
    while start < len(target) - 1:
        middle = (start + end) // 2
        if target[middle] > start:
            # Target is less than or equal to current byte, adjust search range accordingly
```
