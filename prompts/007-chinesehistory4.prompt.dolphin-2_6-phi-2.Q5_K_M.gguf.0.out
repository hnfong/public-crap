To evaluate the failure of the Wanxiu government during its two-year tenure, we can use the following criteria:

1. Stability and Control: 
   The first criterion to consider is stability and control over the region. The Wanxiu government lost control in a series of military revolts which led to its collapse. This instability not only affected internal affairs but also had implications for the security situation in the region. As a result, it was challenging for the Wanxiu government to maintain its grip on power and implement long-term development plans.

2. Economic Performance: 
   The second criterion is economic performance during the Wanxiu government's term. Despite being promised with significant infrastructural development, the economy remained stagnant. The government was unable to deliver on its promises, leading to widespread dissatisfaction among the citizens and further fueling discontent that eventually led to the government's downfall.

3. Governance and Accountability: 
   The Wanxiu government faced accusations of corruption, mismanagement, and a lack of accountability. These issues not only affected public trust in the government but also had implications for investment decisions and foreign relations. Moreover, the government's inability to address these problems exacerbated its internal crisis, leading to further instability.

4. Political Reform: 
   Another factor contributing to the Wanxiu government's failure was its lack of political reform. The government was unable to effectively manage competing interests within the ruling party and failed to implement long-term strategies to improve governance. This ultimately led to a loss of public support and political fragmentation, making it difficult for the government to maintain power.

5. Social Welfare: 
   The Wanxiu government's failure can also be attributed to its inability to address social welfare issues such as poverty, unemployment, and healthcare. These problems not only affected citizens' quality of life but also contributed to a sense of disillusionment with the government.

In conclusion, the Wanxiu government failed due to a combination of internal and external factors, including political instability, economic stagnation, governance issues, lack of accountability, and social welfare concerns. To prevent similar failures in the future, governments must prioritize stability and control over short-term gains, implement effective governance strategies, and address social welfare issues to gain public support and maintain power.
