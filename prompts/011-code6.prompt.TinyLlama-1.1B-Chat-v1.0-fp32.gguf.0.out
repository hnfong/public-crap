Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Sure! Here are two examples of inputs that will lead to the output "Done":

1. Enter a number: 4.0
2. Enter a number: 0.1

In both cases, the program will loop infinitely and eventually return the value `x = 4.0`. So, the program will output "Done".</s>
