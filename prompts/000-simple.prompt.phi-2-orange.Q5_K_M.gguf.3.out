Q1: 1+1=2
Q2: 6*7=42
Q3: 83*59=5237
Q4: 349*683=235417
Q5: 6043*7489=45252657
Q6: 3x + 7 = 22; Subtract 7 from both sides, so 3x = 15; Divide by 3, x = 5
Q7: 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20
Q8: The book costs $15, and I give the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, totaling 40 dollars. She does not have exact change, so she gives me an additional five-dollar bill. So the final change she should give me is 40 - 15 + 5 = 30
Q9: A square has 4 equal sides, so the perimeter P of a square with side length s is 4*s. Here, s=5 units; so the perimeter is 4*5 = 20 units
Q10: Katherine has 3 siblings (2 brothers + 1 sister). So her mother has 3+1 = 4 children
Q11: Evaluate the expression as follows: 3 + 12 ÷ 4 - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5
Q12: There are 5 guests, and they need one slice of cake each. So they need 5 slices of birthday cake
Q13: 20% off means a discount of 20/100 * $25 = $5; so the sale price is $25 - $5 = $20
Q14: From 3:45 PM to 6:30 PM, there are 1 hour and 45 minutes. So there are 60 + 45 = 105 minutes left until 6:30 PM
Q15: If a taxi can carry 4 passengers, then 22 people would need 22/4 = 5.5 taxis. Since you cannot have half of a taxi, you would need 6 taxis for a group of 22 people. 
Q16: The sum of the angles in any triangle is 180 degrees. So if we know two angles are 31° and 62°, then the third angle would be 180 - 31 - 62 = 77°
