Here are a couple sentences in both Cantonese and English. They are written by somebody who is a native Cantonese speaker, but not necessarily good in English. Review the English translations, keeping in mind it should be simple, fluent, written like a native speaker, and to the point. Rate the sentences on a scale of 1 to 5:

1: Sentence structure is confusing. Difficult to understand. Or have obvious grammatical mistakes.
2: Contains minor grammatical errors.
3: No ambiguity or mistakes, but might contain awkward phrases or expressions that sound unnatural to the native speaker.
4: Written fluently, without obvious flaws.
5: Excellent writing and style.


For example:

i. 啲貨咁好賣，唔使慌賺唔到錢喎。 The goods are selling so well, there's no need to fear that you cannot earn money.
ii. 美國每四年會舉行一次總統選舉。 The United States holds a presidential election every four years.

Expected output:

i. Rating: 3 ("there is no need to fear" can be better written as "you do not have to worry")
ii. Rating: 4 (no obvious flaws or problems)

Comments:
A. The phrase "你慌人哋唔等你咩？" could be translated more naturally as "Are you worried that others won't wait for you?" This is a more direct translation of the meaning conveyed in the Cantonese sentence.
C. The phrase "要靠大量浸淫" suggests that learning a language requires a lot of exposure and practice. A more natural way to express this in English would be: "The key is massive exposure to it," or as suggested above, "you need to immerse yourself in it extensively."
D. The translation provided for this sentence is accurate but could be made more fluent by rephrasing it slightly. For example: "Siu-san praised his girlfriend in front of his colleagues on how tender and kind she is." This expresses the idea that Siu-san was showing off his girlfriend's virtues to his coworkers.<|im_end|>
