Consider the following python code:

```
def s(a):
    if len(a) <= 1: return a
    p = a[0]
    l = [x for x in a[1:] if x <= p]
    r = [x for x in a[1:] if x > p]
    return l + [p,] + r
```

What is its intended purpose? Then, please review the code, focusing on mistakes (if any), coding style, efficiency, and any other implementation details that may be of note. Finally, write a new function with all your suggested fixes/improvements, but in the Rust language (not in python).

The code is intended to sort an array using quickSort algorithm. 

Let's go through the review:

Mistakes: There are no major mistakes in this code. However, there may be a potential for errors if passed an empty list or a single-element list as it does not handle these cases correctly. For such cases, it simply returns the original array, which might not be what we want (i.e., to sort them).

Coding Style: The code follows a clear and readable style with good use of comments and appropriate variable names. 

Efficiency: This code uses list comprehension which can make the program run more slowly because it creates new lists in each iteration, taking up additional memory space. This might not be noticeable for small arrays but could become inefficient as the size of the array increases.

In Rust language, we implement similar logic using recursion and slices without creating unnecessary intermediate lists: 
```rust
fn quick_sort(array: &mut Vec<i32>) {
    let len = array.len();
    _quick_sort(array, 0, (if len > 1) len - 1 else 0); // call recursive function if list has more than one element
}

fn _quick_sort(array: &mut Vec<i32>, low: usize, high: isize) {
    if low < high.abs() {
        let p = partition(array, low, high);  // Partitioning array elements
        _quick_sort(array, low, p - 1);   // Sort elements before partition
        _quick_sort(array, p + 1, high);  // sort elements after partition
    }
}

fn partition(arr: &mut Vec<i32>, low: usize, high: isize) -> usize {
    let pivot = arr[low as usize];   // Choosing the first element of array as pivot
    while low < high.abs() {         // While all elements are not sorted 
        while arr[low as usize] <= pivot && low < high.abs() { low += 1; }
        while arr[high as usize] > pivot { high -= 1; }
        if low < high {                     // Swap the two elements in array
            arr.swap(low as usize, high as usize);
        }
    }
    arr.swap((high + 1) as usize, low as usize);   // Swap pivot element with its correct position
    (high + 1) as usize                            // return the partition index
}
```
This code will sort an array of i32 numbers in-place using quickSort algorithm. The function `quick_sort` is used to call the recursive function `_quick_sort`, which handles all operations related to sorting and partitioning elements in the array. Partitioning operation itself happens in the function `partition`.
