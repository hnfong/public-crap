Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties:
- It's an even composite number.
- It's the smallest number divisible by all numbers from 1 to 6 (divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6).
- It is a Harshad number in decimal system because it is divisible by the sum of its digits (1+2+0=3, and 120/3 equals to 40).
- It's a highly composite number since it has more divisors than any other numbers with less than or equal to 120.
- Its divisors include: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60 and itself (120).

Q2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, you can use the quadratic formula which states that for an equation of form ax^2+bx+c=0, then the solutions are given by:
    x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2-4ac)] / (2a)
In this case a=1, b=-7 and c=-18. So the formula gives us two possible solutions:
    x = [ 7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4*1*(-18))] / (2*1)
    x = [ 7 ± sqrt(49+72)] / 2
    x = [ 7 ± sqrt(121)] / 2
    x = [ 7 ± 11] / 2
Therefore, the two solutions are x=6 and x=-13.

Q3: The train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between the two cities that are 200km apart. It takes (distance/speed) to travel from one city to another which is about: 200 / 60 = 3.3 hours for a single trip. Since there's 24 hours in a day and assuming negligible time at the stations, this means that it can make 24 / 3.3 (or approximately) ~7 trips within one full day. But since we are looking for round-trips not just one way trips, this implies that it makes about 7/2 = 3.5 round trip per a full day which is approximately 4 when considering whole rounds only. So the answer would be approximately 4 round-trips between those cities within a full day.
