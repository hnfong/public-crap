Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Yes, there are certain inputs that will lead to the output "Done". The condition `x < math.inf` is always true when the loop ends, which means the loop will always execute at least once, leading to the output "Done". 

Here are two examples:

1. If we input `0`, then the value of `inc` becomes 0 and the while loop starts with `x = 0`. Inside the while loop, `x += inc` is equivalent to `x = x + 0`, so `x` remains at its initial value of `0`. Thus, when `x < math.inf` is evaluated again after the first iteration, it will always be true, leading to the output "Done".

2. If we input a positive number as `inc`, such as `1`, then the while loop starts with `x = 0`. Inside the while loop, `x += inc` is equivalent to `x = x + 1`, so `x` becomes `1`. Thus, when `x < math.inf` is evaluated again after the first iteration, it will always be true, leading to the output "Done".

These are just two examples, there can be many other inputs that lead to the output "Done" for this program.
