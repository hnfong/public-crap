Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Bubble Sort Algorithm:
The Bubble Sort algorithm is a simple comparison-based sorting method that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Here's a Python implementation of bubble sort:

```python
def bubbleSort(arr):
    n = len(arr)

    # Traverse through all array elements
    for i in range(n-1):

        # Last i elements are already in place
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):

            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]

    return arr

# Test the function with an example list
print(bubbleSort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]))
```

Merge Sort Algorithm:
The Merge Sort algorithm is a Divide and Conquer approach to sorting. It divides the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted). Then it repeatedly merges these sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.

Here's a Python implementation of merge sort:

```python
def mergeSort(arr):

    # If array contains 1 or 0 elements, it's already sorted
    if len(arr) > 1:

        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left_half = arr[:mid]
        right_half = arr[mid:]

        # Recursively sort both halves
        mergeSort(left_half)
        mergeSort(right_half)

        i = j = k = 0

        # Merge sorted halves
        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
                arr[k] = left_half[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right_half[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1

        # Copy the remaining elements (if any)
        while i < len(left_half):
            arr[k] = left_half[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1

        while j < len(right_half):
            arr[k] = right_half[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1

    return arr

# Test the function with an example list
print(mergeSort([64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]))
```

Comparison between Bubble Sort and Merge Sort:

1. Time Complexity: 
   Bubble Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which means it gets slower as the size of the input increases. Merge Sort has a time complexity of O(n log n), making it much faster for large lists.

2. Space Complexity:
   Both Bubble Sort and Merge Sort have a space complexity of O(n). While both algorithms require extra memory to store temporary arrays during merging, Merge Sort does so less frequently than Bubble Sort due to its divide-and-conquer approach.

3. Stability:
   Bubble Sort is an unstable sort because it can change the relative order of equal elements. Merge Sort is a stable sort because it preserves the original relative order of equal elements.

4. Adaptability:
   Bubble Sort adapts well to small lists, while Merge Sort works best with large lists due to its efficient time complexity. However, Merge Sort's space complexity becomes an issue for very large lists.

In conclusion, Bubble Sort is a simple and easy-to-understand sorting algorithm but is not efficient for large data sets due to its high time complexity. On the other hand, Merge Sort is more complex but offers better performance on large lists with its logarithmic time complexity.
 Thus, when deciding between bubble sort and merge sort, it's important to consider factors like space complexity, adaptability, stability, and efficiency based on your specific requirements and constraints.
