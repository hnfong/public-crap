Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?



### Response:

Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties and significance in mathematics including being divisible by every positive integer less than or equal to its square root (which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30 and 40). It is also known as the "triangular number" because it can be represented as a triangular pattern of dots (1+2+3+...+10=55) or a triangle (4x3/2=6), which gives us the fact that 120 is the product of its factors, 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,15 and 20.

Q2: The given equation is a quadratic equation in standard form (ax^2 + bx + c = 0). To solve it, we first must find the values of 'a' (coefficient of x^2), which is -7, and 'b' (coefficient of x), which is 1.

The roots of this quadratic equation can be found using the formula:
x = [-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / (2a)

where a = -7, b = 1, and c = -18.
Plugging these values into the equation gives:

x = [1 ± sqrt((1)^2 - 4*(-7)*(-18))] / (2*(-7))
  = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 9 * 36)] / -14
  = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 324)] / -14
  = [1 ± sqrt(325)] / -14

This simplifies to:
x = (1 + sqrt(325)) / -14, and x = (1 - sqrt(325)) / -14.

However, we are only interested in positive values of x because distances cannot be negative. Thus, the solution is x = [1 + sqrt(325)] / 14.

Q3: The time it takes for a train to travel from one city to another is given by distance/speed. In this case, the distance between the two cities is 200km and the speed of the train is 60 km/h. Therefore, the time it takes to cover this distance is T = 200 / 60 = __3__ hours.

Since the train covers the same distance in both directions, there are 4 times that many round trips in a day, or __\boxed{12}\__.
