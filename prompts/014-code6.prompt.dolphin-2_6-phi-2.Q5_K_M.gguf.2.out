Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

The program is designed to keep adding the input number (inc) to the variable x, which is initialized as 0.0 and will continue indefinitely because it is less than math.inf. 

As long as the user enters a positive number for inc, the loop will not terminate because the condition `x < math.inf` is always true. For example:

1. If the user enters 1.0 as the input (inc), the program will keep adding 1.0 to 0.0 indefinitely and print "Done" never.

2. If the user enters a negative number as the input (inc), the loop will still run for positive numbers of inc, but it won't reach the desired output "Done". For example, if the user enters -1.0 as the input, the program will add 1.0 to 0.0 (-1.0) and then subtract 1.0 from the result (0.0), which is still less than math.inf. 

So, there are no inputs that will lead to the output "Done" in this specific program implementation. The output would only occur if the user enters a negative number as the input for inc, which would cause the loop to terminate after reaching -math.inf.
