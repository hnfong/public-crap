If a theory (either an axiom, or logic framework, or a combination of both) proves itself, do we call it "consistent" or "tautological"? Can you give some examples of such theories?

If a theory proves itself, it is considered "tautological," meaning the theory is true by definition or by virtue of its logical form. A theory is considered "consistent" if it cannot prove a contradiction, i.e., it does not prove both a statement and its negation to be true.

Examples of tautological theories:

1. Axiomatic systems: Some axiomatic systems, such as Peano Arithmetic, are designed to be self-evident or tautological in nature. Peano Arithmetic is a set of axioms that serve as the basis for the natural numbers and arithmetic. It is considered tautological because its axioms are self-evident and do not lead to contradictions.
2. First-order logic: First-order logic is a formal system used to express mathematical concepts. It is considered tautological because its logical rules are self-evident and do not lead to contradictions.
3. Classical propositional logic: Classical propositional logic is a system of formal logic that deals with the manipulation of propositions, which are statements that can be either true or false. It is considered tautological because its logical rules are self-evident and do not lead to contradictions.

Examples of consistent theories:

1. Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory (ZF): ZF is a widely accepted axiomatic set theory that does not prove itself. It is considered consistent because it has not been proven to lead to contradictions.
2. Euclidean geometry: Euclidean geometry is a system of geometric axioms and theorems that do not prove themselves. It is considered consistent because it has not been proven to lead to contradictions.
3. Second-order arithmetic: Second-order arithmetic is an extension of Peano Arithmetic that deals with sets of natural numbers. It is considered consistent because it has not been proven to lead to contradictions.

In summary, a theory that proves itself is tautological, while a theory that does not prove itself but also does not lead to contradictions is considered consistent.
