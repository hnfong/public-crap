Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Yes, there are input values for `inc` that will result in the program printing "Done". Here are two examples:

1. If you enter a positive number other than zero as `inc` (e.g., 0.5), the loop will continue until `x` becomes greater than or equal to infinity. This is because `inf` is an infinite value and it cannot be reached by adding any finite increment. In this case, the program would never terminate. However, if you input a positive number that is very large (e.g., 10^100), then the program will take a long time to execute but eventually print "Done" after reaching the value of `x` greater than or equal to infinity.

2. If you enter zero as `inc` (i.e., inc = 0.0), each iteration of the loop will not change the value of `x` since it is being incremented by 0. Therefore, the condition for terminating the while loop (`x < math.inf`) will always be false and the program would never print "Done". However, if you input a negative number other than zero as inc (e.g., -0.5), then `x` will decrease towards minus infinity, and it will never reach infinity, resulting in an infinite loop without printing "Done".
