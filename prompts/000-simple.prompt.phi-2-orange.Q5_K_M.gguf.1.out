A1: 1+1=2
A2: 6*7=42
A3: 83*59=4967
A4: 349*683=233187
A5: 6043*7489=44691217
A6: 3x + 7 = 22 => 3x = 15 => x = 5
A7: 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20
A8: The book costs $15, and the shopkeeper gives two 20 dollar bills and an additional five dollar bill, so the total she received is 2*20 + 5 = 45 dollars. Since I gave her 45 - 15 = 30 dollars, the final change she should give me is 30 dollars.
A9: The perimeter of a square with side length 5 units is 4 * 5 = 20 units.
A10: Katherine has three siblings (two brothers and one sister), so her mother must have three children.
A11: 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1 = 3 + 3 - 1 = 5
A12: If 5 guests have arrived, they need 5 slices of birthday cake each, so in total they need 5 * 1 slice = 5 slices of birthday cake.
A13: The original price is $25 and the shirt is on sale for 20% off, so the discount is 0.20 * 25 = $5. So the sale price is $25 - $5 = $20.
A14: There are 90 minutes in 1 hour, and 6 hours have passed until 6:30 PM, so there are 6*60 = 360 minutes. Since 3:45 PM has already passed, there are 360 - (3*60 + 45) = 225 minutes left until 6:30 PM.
A15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers, so we divide the number of people in the group by 4 to find out how many taxis are needed. 22 / 4 = 5 with a remainder of 2, so we need 5 full taxis and an additional one for the remaining 2 people, so 6 taxis are needed for a group of 22 people.
A16: The sum of two angles is 31 + 62 = 93 degrees. So the third angle in the triangle must be 180 - 93 = 87 degrees.
