Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Yes, it is possible for this program to produce the output "Done". Here are two examples:

1. If you enter `0` as input, then `inc = float(0)`, which evaluates to 0. In this case, the while loop will never be executed because x starts at 0 and does not change inside the loop (since it would always add a value of zero). Therefore, "Done" is printed immediately after entering the number.
2. Another example could be if you enter `1` as input, then `inc = float(1)`, which evaluates to 1. In this case, x starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time through the loop. The loop will continue until x reaches a value greater than or equal to math.inf (infinity). Since infinity is not reachable using floating-point arithmetic, the while loop condition `x < math.inf` remains true forever, so "Done" will never be printed and the program would run infinitely without producing an output of "Done".
