The National People's Congress (NPC) is like a very important meeting where adults from all over China come together to discuss and make decisions about how their country should be run. They are responsible for making laws, choosing leaders, and keeping track of what the government does with its money. It's sort of like when you and your friends decide who will get which toy or how long you'll play a game, but on a much bigger scale. So they work hard to make sure that China is a good place for everyone to live in.
