Here are the answers to each question with steps:

**Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.**

The number 120 is a highly composite number, which means it has a large number of divisors. Some of its interesting properties are:

* 120 is the smallest number that can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12.
* 120 is a abundant number, meaning that the sum of its proper divisors (excluding the number itself) is greater than the number.
* 120 is a highly totient number, which means it has a large number of solutions to the equation φ(x) = 120, where φ is Euler's totient function.
* 120 is the number of degrees in a straight angle.
* 120 is the sum of the internal angles of a hexagon (6 x 20 = 120).

**Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0**

To solve this quadratic equation, we can factor it:

x^2 - 7x - 18 = (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

This tells us that either (x - 9) = 0 or (x + 2) = 0.

Solving for x, we get:

x - 9 = 0 --> x = 9

x + 2 = 0 --> x = -2

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

**Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?**

Let's break this problem down step by step:

1. First, we need to find the time it takes for the train to make one round trip. The distance between the two cities is 200 km, and the train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h. Therefore, the time it takes for one way is:

Time = Distance / Speed = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours

Since it's a round trip, we need to multiply this time by 2:

Time for one round trip = 2 x 3.33 hours = 6.67 hours

2. Now, we need to find out how many round trips the train can make within a full day (24 hours). We can do this by dividing the total time by the time it takes for one round trip:

Number of round trips = Total time / Time for one round trip
= 24 hours / 6.67 hours
= 3.6

Since you can't make a fraction of a round trip, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the train can make 3 round trips within a full day.
