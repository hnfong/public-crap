Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Yes, there are certain inputs that would result in the program printing "Done". The `while` loop will only stop when the value of x is greater than or equal to infinity (`math.inf`), which can never happen with floating point numbers because they have a maximum limit for precision. However, if the input number ("inc") is 0, then the while-loop condition will be false from the beginning and the program will directly print "Done". If the input number is negative, it would also make x decrease instead of increase and eventually reach zero or become smaller than zero depending on how small the increment (negative value) is. For example:

Example 1: `inc = 0` - This would lead to outputting "Done" immediately because the while-loop condition will be false from the beginning, x won't change and remain zero which is less than infinity.

Example 2: `inc = -3.5` - If a negative number (such as -3.5) is entered, then x would decrease instead of increase. Let's say initially x is set to be 0. With each iteration, it will become more and more negative, and the while-loop condition won't reach infinity thus eventually leading to printing "Done".
