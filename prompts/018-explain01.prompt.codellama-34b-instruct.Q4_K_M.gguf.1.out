Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.


### Response:

Yo, listen here little homie, let me school you on the Fed.
The FED is like the boss man, he got control over the money and the debt. 
He can make or break a economy with one move. He got the power to print bills and coins, that's right! He can create wealth just by pressin a button. 
He can also lower interest rates, that means more money for the banks, so they can lend to folks. 
And if he don't like somethin, he can raise interest rates, then banks will have less money and people won't borrow as much.
So the FED is a big deal, he got the power to control the economy. That's it!
