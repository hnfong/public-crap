Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?



### Response:

Q1: The number 120 is a significant number because of its properties. It is twice 60, thrice 40, and five times 24. It is also half of 240, which is a multiple of the first 9 prime numbers, and it is divisible by all the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

Q2: The equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0 can be factored into (x - 6)(x + 3) = 0, which gives us x = 6 and x = -3 as the roots of the equation.

Q3: The average speed of the train is 60 km/h, so it covers a distance of 120 km in one hour. Since the two cities are 200 km apart, it takes 2 hours to travel between them. In total, the train can make 24 round trips between the two cities within a full day since 24 x 2 = 48 hours is less than 24 hours.
