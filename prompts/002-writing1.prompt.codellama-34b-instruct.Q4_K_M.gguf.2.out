### Response:

One day, a young girl was sitting on a fluffy pillow in the sky when she saw a beautiful cloud floating by. The cloud looked like a big ball of cotton candy and it sparkled in the sunlight. The little girl thought that the cloud looked so soft and inviting, so she decided to fly down from her pillow and hug it.

As soon as she reached out to hug the cloud, she was surprised when it started to shrink away from her! She tried again, but the cloud kept getting smaller and smaller no matter how hard she hugged it. 

The little girl got frustrated and thought that the cloud must be playing a trick on her. So, she decided to exaggerate her love for the cloud by hugging it even harder. 

But instead of shrinking away from her, the cloud suddenly grew bigger and bigger until it became as large as a house! The little girl was amazed that her love had made such a big difference in the size of the cloud. From then on, she loved the cloud even more and they lived happily ever after.
