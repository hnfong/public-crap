Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

Bubble Sort:

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name from the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to their appropriate positions within the list.

Here's a Python implementation of bubble sort:

```python
def bubble_sort(lst):
    n = len(lst)

    # Traverse through all array elements
    for i in range(n):
        # Last i elements are already in place
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
            if lst[j] > lst[j+1]:
                lst[j], lst[j+1] = lst[j+1], lst[j]

    return lst
```

Merge Sort:

Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by dividing the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted), then repeatedly merges these sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.

Here's a Python implementation of merge sort:

```python
def merge_sort(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:  # Base case for recursion
        return lst

    mid = len(lst) // 2
    left_list = merge_sort(lst[:mid])  # Recursive call to divide the list
    right_list = merge_sort(lst[mid:])  # Recursive call to divide the list

    return merge(left_list, right_list)  # Merge function to combine sorted lists

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i = j = 0

    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] <= right[j]:  # Compare elements and append smaller one to result
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1

    result += left[i:]  # Append any remaining elements from the left list
    result += right[j:]  # Append any remaining elements from the right list

    return result
```

Comparison between Bubble Sort and Merge Sort:

1. Time complexity: Bubble sort has a worst-case and average time complexity of O(n^2), while merge sort has a worst-case, average, and best case of O(n log n). This makes merge sort much more efficient than bubble sort for large datasets.
2. Space complexity: Merge sort requires additional space for merging sublists, which can be more significant than bubble sort's in-place sorting approach. However, the extra space is usually not an issue if you're using Python and don't need to modify the input array (as both implementations do).
3. Stability: Bubble sort is a stable algorithm that maintains the relative order of equal elements, while merge sort does not guarantee this property.
4. Adaptive efficiency: Merge sort performs better than bubble sort on nearly sorted lists due to its divide-and-conquer approach. This makes it more efficient for large datasets where most of the data is already in order or almost sorted.
5. Readability and maintainability: Bubble sort's simple, iterative nature can make it easier to understand and modify, but merge sort's recursion and merging steps might be more challenging for some people. However, both algorithms have a well-documented structure and are easy to read once you're familiar with them.
