Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.


### Response:

Both Bubble Sort and Merge Sort are sorting algorithms that take an array of unordered numbers, then sort them into ascending order by comparing adjacent elements and swapping their positions until all elements are sorted. However, the way these algorithms achieve this differs.

The main difference between Bubble Sort and Merge Sort is their approach to comparing adjacent elements. In Bubble Sort, we start from index 0 and compare each element at index i with its next neighbor at index i + 1. If a[i] is larger than a[i+1], they are swapped. This process continues until no more swaps are needed.

In Merge Sort, we divide the array into two halves (left and right) then compare the first elements of each half, a[0] with a[n/2]. We keep track of the smallest value between these two, then move on to comparing the second elements of each half and so on. If a[k] is smaller than a[n/2 + k], they are swapped.

The key difference lies in how Bubble Sort compares elements - by iterating through the entire array repeatedly until no more swaps are needed, while Merge Sort divides the array into subarrays and merges them together after each comparison. This results in a much faster runtime for Merge Sort (O(n log n)) than Bubble Sort (O(n^2)), especially with larger arrays.

Another benefit of Merge Sort is that it is a stable sort, meaning it preserves the order or equal elements - this is not true for Bubble Sort.

In conclusion, while both algorithms achieve the same result, they differ in their approach to comparing and swapping elements within an array. While Bubble Sort is simple to implement, Merge Sort offers much better runtime performance due to its ability to divide and conquer the input array.
