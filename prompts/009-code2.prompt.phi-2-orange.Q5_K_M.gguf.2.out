Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a file with names sorted lexicographically directly, we can follow these steps:

1. Read all lines from the text file and store them as elements in an array. While reading each line, convert it to lowercase (for case-insensitive sorting) and remove whitespace using string methods like `strip()`. Since strings are ordered lexicographically in Python, this will ensure our array remains sorted correctly.
2. Write a binary search function that takes the file path, target name to find, and the start and end indices of the range within which to perform the search.
3. In this function, first check if the start index is greater than the end index. If so, there are no names in the file or the target does not exist in the file, return -1.
4. Calculate the middle index as `(start + end) // 2`.
5. Compare the name at the middle index with the target name. If they match, return the middle index (as this is the position of the target). If the target name is less than the name at the middle index, continue the search in the first half of the file. If the target name is greater, continue the search in the second half of the file.
6. Recursively call the binary search function with the updated start and end indices based on the comparison result from step 5. The new range for searching will be `(start + 1) // 2 <= middle < (end - 1) // 2`. This ensures that we keep halving the search space until we find the target or exhaust all possibilities within a logarithmic number of steps.
7. If the function returns after performing O(log(n)) operations, it means the target was found. Otherwise, the insertion point (where the target should be inserted to maintain sorted order) can be calculated as `start + 1 + bisect_left((end - start) // 2, target)`. The `bisect_left()` function in Python's built-in `bisect` module can be used to find the leftmost insertion point for a value in a sorted list.

Here is the Python code implementing this approach:

```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path) as file:
        names = [name.strip().lower() for name in file]

    def binary_search(start, end):
        if start > end:
            return -1

        middle = (start + end) // 2
        name_at_middle = names[middle].strip().lower()

        if target == name_at_middle:
            return middle

        elif target < name_at_middle:
            return binary_search(start, middle - 1)

        else:
            return binary_search(middle + 1, end)

    return start + 1 + bisect.bisect_left((end - start) // 2, target.strip().lower())
```

To use this function, simply call it with the file path and target name as arguments:

```python
position = binary_search_file('names.txt', 'alice')
print(f"The position of 'Alice' is: {position}")
```
