What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)

<|im_start|>assistant
 The output of this program will be a number that is very close to infinity, as the while loop continually multiplies `x` by 1.001 (a value slightly greater than 1). In practice, due to floating point precision errors in Python's float data type, the program may never actually reach infinity, but will continue to increase towards it indefinitely.
