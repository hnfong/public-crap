Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search directly on a file sorted in lexicographical order, we need to read the content of the file into memory first. Then, we can apply the binary search algorithm to this data. 

First, let's understand how binary search works. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It halves the search space in each step by comparing the target value to the middle element of the list. If the target value matches the middle element, its position in the list can be returned. If the target value is less than the middle element, the right half of the list is ignored and the left half is searched. If the target value is greater than the middle element, then the left half of the list is ignored and the right half is searched. This process repeats until the item is found or all elements have been examined.

The problem states that we need to perform this search on a file directly, which means we can't use any built-in Python functions for binary search such as `bisect_left`. 

Here's an implementation of a function `binary_search_file` in Python:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    # Open the file and read its content into memory
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        data = sorted([line.strip() for line in f])

    # Perform binary search on the data
    left = 0
    right = len(data) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if target == data[mid]:
            return mid
        elif target < data[mid]:
            right = mid - 1
        else:  # target > data[mid]
            left = mid + 1

    # Insertion point for a value not found in the list
    return left
```
This function opens the file specified by `file_path`, reads its content into memory, and sorts it. Then, it performs the binary search on this sorted data. If the target is found in the data, the function returns its position (index). If not, the function returns the insertion point for a value not found in the list (the leftmost index that's greater than the target).

This implementation uses a while loop with two pointers `left` and `right`, each starting at the first and last indices of the data. It continues to halve the search space until it finds the target or all elements have been examined. This gives us an O(log(n)) time complexity, as required by the problem.
