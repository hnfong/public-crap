  Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

 The program is guaranteed to never reach the print statement and thus will not produce any outputs, including "Done". Here's why:

1. The initial value of x is set to 0.0, which means it starts at zero.
2. The user enters a positive number (float) called inc. This number can be as small as you like, but it will always be positive and greater than zero.
3. The while loop begins, where the condition checks if x < math.inf (which is equivalent to float("+inf")). Since x starts at 0.0 and will never become negative due to inc being positive, this condition is always true.
4. Inside the while loop, x += inc adds inc to x with each iteration. Even if inc is a very small number, it will still increase x by some amount each time the loop runs.
5. Since x starts at zero and continues to increase, it will never become equal to math.inf or greater than it. The condition of x < math.inf will always be true, and the while loop will continue forever, without ever reaching the print statement.
6. Therefore, there is no possible input that can lead to the output "Done". No matter what inc is, the program will never stop running and will never reach the print statement.

Here are two examples of inputs that demonstrate this:

1. Enter a number: 0.01 (or any other positive float)
2. The while loop runs forever without printing "Done".
3. Enter a number: 5000 (or any other positive integer)
4. The while loop runs forever without printing "Done". Source: assistant
