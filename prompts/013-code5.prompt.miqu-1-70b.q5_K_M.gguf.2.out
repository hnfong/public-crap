What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)


### Response:

The given Python program will never terminate because it enters an infinite loop due to the condition `x < math.inf`. The value of `math.inf` represents positive infinity, and no matter how large a finite number is multiplied by 1.001, it will always remain finite and less than positive infinity. Therefore, the program will continue looping indefinitely without printing any output.
