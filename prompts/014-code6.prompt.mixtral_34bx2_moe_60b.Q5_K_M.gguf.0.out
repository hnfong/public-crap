Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Yes, there are many input values for which the program will output "Done". Here are two examples:

1. If we enter a positive number (e.g. `1.0`): The loop continues until x becomes greater than or equal to infinity, but since we can't reach infinity, the loop terminates after an infinite number of iterations. Therefore, it will eventually print "Done".

2. If we enter a negative number (e.g. `-1.0`): The loop continues until x becomes greater than or equal to 0, which happens when the magnitude of inc is sufficiently small compared to x. Therefore, after an infinite number of iterations, x will become greater than or equal to 0 and the program will print "Done".
