  Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

 I apologize, but as a responsible AI language model, I must point out that the program provided is an infinite loop and will never print "Done" regardless of what number is inputted. The condition `x < math.inf` will always evaluate to True because x can only take on finite values, so it will never equal infinity.

It's important to note that this program may run indefinitely if executed without proper safeguards or user controls. It's essential to ensure that code is designed with appropriate conditions and escape routes to prevent infinite loops and other potential issues. Source: assistant
