Consider the following python code:

```
def s(a):
    if len(a) <= 1: return a
    p = a[0]
    l = [x for x in a[1:] if x <= p]
    r = [x for x in a[1:] if x > p]
    return l + [p,] + r
```

What is its intended purpose? Then, please review the code, focusing on mistakes (if any), coding style, efficiency, and any other implementation details that may be of note. Finally, write a new function with all your suggested fixes/improvements, but in the Rust language (not in python).

The intended purpose of this Python code is to split an array `a` into two parts based on a pivot value `p`. The elements less than or equal to `p` are placed in the left part, and those greater than `p` are placed in the right part. The pivot element `p` is returned at its original position.

Now, let's review the code:

- In terms of mistakes (if any), I don't find anything that directly leads to errors in the functionality. However, there could be some improvements made regarding coding style and efficiency.

- Coding Style: The use of list comprehensions for `l` and `r` is an idiomatic Python approach, but it could potentially lead to lower performance for large inputs compared to a traditional loop with appending elements directly to the lists.

- Efficiency: For very large inputs, this implementation might have some inefficiencies. The use of list comprehensions leads to creating two new lists, which are then concatenated into one at the end. This could be optimized by appending elements directly to a result list instead of using list comprehension for `l` and `r`.

Now let's write an improved version in Rust:

```rust
fn split<T: Ord>(arr: &[T]) -> (Vec<T>, Vec<T>) {
    let mut l = vec![];
    let mut r = vec![];
    let p = arr[0];

    for x in &arr[1..] {
        if *x <= p {
            l.push(*x);
        } else {
            r.push(*x);
        }
    }

    (l, r)
}
```

This Rust function takes an array and returns a tuple containing two vectors - one for elements less than or equal to the pivot `p` (in order), and another for elements greater than `p`. The use of mutable variables `l` and `r` allows us to append elements directly without having to concatenate at the end. This can be more efficient for large inputs compared to creating a new list for each part.
