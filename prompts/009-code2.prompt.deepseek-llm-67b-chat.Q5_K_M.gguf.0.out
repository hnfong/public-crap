Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a file directly using at most O(log n) operations, you can use Python's built-in `os.stat` function to get the size of the file in bytes and then read the file contents in chunks. The binary search algorithm can be implemented by dividing the file into two halves after each comparison until the target is found or the subfile being searched becomes empty.

Here is a python function that implements this approach:
```python
import os

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    # get size of file in bytes
    file_size = os.stat(file_path).st_size
    
    # initialize left and right pointers to 0 and file_size - 1
    left, right = 0, file_size - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        # read the chunk of text at position 'mid' in the file
        with open(file_path, "r") as f:
            f.seek(mid * os.linesep.size)
            line = next(f).strip()
            
        if line == target:
            return mid
        
        # update left and right pointers based on comparison of 'target' with the text at position 'mid'
        elif line < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    # if target not found in file, return insertion point as per binary search algorithm
    return -(left+1)
```
