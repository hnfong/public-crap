Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a file directly, you need to read the file in a way that allows you to access any part of it directly, without having to read the entire file. This is where the concept of "random access" comes in. In Python, you can use the `mmap` (memory-mapped file) module to read a file in this way.

First, you need to open the file in binary mode and create a memory-mapped object for it. Then, you can read the file in chunks of a fixed size (e.g., 4 KB) and search for the target name in each chunk using a binary search. If the target is not found in a chunk, you can move on to the next chunk.

Here is a Python function that implements this approach:
```python
import mmap

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r', buffering=0) as f:
        mm = mmap.mmap(f.fileno(), 0, access=mmap.ACCESS_READ)
        try:
            # get the length of the file in bytes
            file_length = mm.size()
            
            # calculate the chunk size in bytes
            chunk_size = 4096
            
            # calculate the number of chunks in the file
            num_chunks = file_length // chunk_size
            
            # initialize the insertion point to 0
            insertion_point = 0
            
            # search for the target in each chunk
            for chunk_idx in range(num_chunks):
                # calculate the start and end positions of the chunk
                chunk_start = chunk_idx * chunk_size
                chunk_end = (chunk_idx + 1) * chunk_size
                
                # read the chunk into memory
                chunk = mm[chunk_start:chunk_end].decode()
                
                # split the chunk into lines
                lines = chunk.split('\n')
                
                # perform a binary search on the lines
                insertion_point_in_chunk = bisect_left(lines, target)
                
                # if the target is found, update the insertion point
                if insertion_point_in_chunk < len(lines) and lines[insertion_point_in_chunk] == target:
                    insertion_point = chunk_start // chunk_size + insertion_point_in_chunk
                    break
                else:
                    # if the target is not found, update the insertion point
                    insertion_point = chunk_start // chunk_size + insertion_point_in_chunk
            else:
                # if the target is not found in any chunk, update the insertion point
                insertion_point = file_length // chunk_size + len(mm[file_length - chunk_size:].split('\n'))
                
        finally:
            mm.close()
    
    return insertion_point
```
This function takes the file path and the target name as input, and returns the position of the target in the file, or the insertion point if the target is not found. The `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module is used to perform the binary search on the lines in each chunk.

Note that this function assumes that the file is sorted in lexicographical order, and that the names in the file are unique. If the file is not sorted or if there are duplicate names, you may need to modify the function accordingly.
