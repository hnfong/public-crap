### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case involves Donald Tsang, the former Chief Executive of Hong Kong, who was charged with bribery and misconduct in public office. The charges stemmed from his dealings with Wong Cho-bau, a mainland businessman, concerning the refurbishment and rental of a residential property in Shenzhen. 

The key events are as follows:
- In 2010, Tsang began discussions with Wong about renting a property in Shenzhen for three years after his retirement.
- The property was owned by a company controlled by Wong, and Tsang proposed that Wong would renovate the property at his expense.
- During this period, Wong's company, Wave Media Limited (WML), applied for broadcasting licences, which Tsang's office was involved in approving.
- In 2012, media reports surfaced about Tsang's dealings with Wong, leading to an investigation by the Independent Commission Against Corruption.
- Tsang was charged with bribery for accepting the renovations as a bribe and misconduct in public office for failing to disclose his dealings with Wong to the Executive Council (ExCo).

The trial resulted in a hung jury on the bribery charge but a conviction on the misconduct charge. Tsang appealed the conviction, arguing that the trial judge's directions to the jury were inadequate.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments

#### Prosecution's Argument:
- The prosecution argued that Tsang's dealings with Wong were corrupt, and he deliberately concealed these dealings to avoid disclosing a bribe.
- They contended that Tsang's failure to disclose his relationship with Wong was a deliberate act of concealment, knowing that it would compromise his integrity.
- The prosecution emphasized that Tsang's actions were serious and amounted to a wilful misconduct in public office, as he was in a position of divided loyalties and hopelessly compromised.

#### Defense's Argument:
- The defense argued that Tsang's dealings with Wong were commercial and arm's-length, and there was no evidence of corruption or bribery.
- They contended that Tsang did not deliberately conceal his dealings but rather made a conscious decision not to disclose them, believing it was unnecessary.
- The defense argued that the trial judge's directions on wilfulness and seriousness were inadequate, as they did not properly address the possibility that Tsang's actions were not corrupt but merely a matter of judgment.
- They also argued that the jury's verdict on Count 2 (misconduct in public office) was flawed due to the lack of clear guidance on the elements of the offense and the possible defenses.

### 3. Summary of the Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The key legal principles in this case revolve around the elements of the offense of misconduct in public office and the adequacy of the trial judge's directions to the jury.

#### Elements of Misconduct in Public Office:
- **Public Official**: The accused must be a public official.
- **In the Course of or in Relation to Public Office**: The misconduct must occur in the context of the public office.
- **Wilful Misconduct**: The misconduct must be deliberate and not accidental or inadvertent.
- **Without Reasonable Excuse or Justification**: The misconduct must not be excused or justified.
- **Seriousness**: The misconduct must be serious enough to warrant condemnation and punishment.

#### Wilfulness:
- The prosecution argued that "wilful" means deliberate, implying that the accused knew their conduct was unlawful or deliberately disregarded the risk of it being unlawful.
- The defense argued that "wilful" should also include situations where the accused made a deliberate decision not to disclose, but without the knowledge that such disclosure was required or without disregarding the risk of it being required.

#### Seriousness:
- The seriousness of the misconduct must be assessed by considering the responsibilities of the office, the importance of the public objects served, and the nature and extent of the departure from those responsibilities.
- The prosecution argued that the misconduct was serious due to the potential conflict of interest and the compromised position of Tsang.
- The defense argued that the trial judge's directions on seriousness were inadequate, as they did not properly address the possibility that Tsang's actions were not corrupt but merely a matter of judgment.

#### Adequacy of Directions:
- The trial judge's directions on wilfulness and seriousness were found to be inadequate, as they did not properly address the alternative case where the bribery charge was not accepted.
- The directions failed to distinguish between deliberate non-disclosure and deliberate concealment, which are different in terms of the level of culpability.
- The directions also did not provide sufficient guidance on how to assess the seriousness of the misconduct in the absence of a finding of corruption.

#### Conclusion:
- The appeal court allowed the appeal, quashed Tsang's conviction and sentence, and found that the trial judge's directions were inadequate, particularly in the context of the alternative case where the bribery charge was not accepted.
- The court emphasized the importance of providing clear and comprehensive directions to the jury, especially in cases involving complex and ambiguous elements of the offense.

This case highlights the importance of clear judicial directions in complex criminal cases, particularly where the prosecution's primary case is not accepted by the jury, and the alternative case requires careful analysis. The decision underscores the need for trial judges to provide detailed guidance on the elements of the offense and possible defenses, ensuring that the jury can make an informed and reasoned decision.
