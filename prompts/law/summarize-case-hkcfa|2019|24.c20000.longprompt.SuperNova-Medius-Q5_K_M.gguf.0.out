### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case involves Donald Tsang, the former Chief Executive of Hong Kong, who was charged with bribery and misconduct in public office. The charges stemmed from his dealings with Wong Cho-bau, a mainland businessman, concerning the refurbishment and rental of a residential property in Shenzhen. Tsang proposed to occupy the property after his retirement. The prosecution alleged that Tsang accepted the refurbishment and rental of the property as a bribe in connection with broadcasting license applications made by a company in which Wong held shares. 

Tsang was tried on two counts: the first for bribery and the second for misconduct in public office. The jury could not agree on the bribery charge, but convicted Tsang on the misconduct charge. He was sentenced to 20 months in prison, which was later reduced to 12 months. Tsang appealed his conviction and sentence, arguing that the trial judge's directions on the elements of misconduct in public office were inadequate.

### 2. Arguments of the Two Parties

**Prosecution's Arguments:**
- The prosecution argued that Tsang's dealings with Wong were corrupt and that he deliberately concealed these dealings from the Executive Council (ExCo) to avoid disclosing a conflict of interest.
- They contended that Tsang's failure to disclose his negotiations with Wong amounted to misconduct in public office, even if the bribery charge was not proven.
- The prosecution emphasized that Tsang's actions were deliberate and that he knew his conduct was unlawful.

**Defense's Arguments:**
- The defense argued that Tsang's dealings with Wong were commercial and arm's-length, and that there was no connection between these dealings and the broadcasting license applications.
- They contended that Tsang did not deliberately conceal his dealings and that his failure to disclose was due to an error of judgment rather than wilful misconduct.
- The defense argued that the trial judge's directions on the elements of misconduct in public office were inadequate, particularly regarding the requirement for the jury to find that Tsang knew his conduct was unlawful.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The key legal principles in this case relate to the elements of the common law offense of misconduct in public office, particularly the requirements of wilfulness and seriousness.

**Wilfulness:**
- The offense of misconduct in public office requires that the official's conduct be wilful, meaning deliberate and not accidental or inadvertent.
- The prosecution must prove that the official knew that his conduct was unlawful or deliberately disregarded the risk that it was unlawful.
- The trial judge's direction on wilfulness was criticized for not distinguishing between a deliberate decision not to disclose and a decision made in error of judgment.

**Seriousness:**
- The offense must be serious, not trivial, and must involve an element of culpability that is calculated to injure the public interest.
- The seriousness of the misconduct must be assessed in light of the responsibilities of the office, the importance of the public objects served, and the nature and extent of the departure from those responsibilities.
- The trial judge's direction on seriousness was criticized for not providing sufficient guidance on how to assess the seriousness of the alleged misconduct in the absence of a finding of corruption.

**Separate Consideration of Counts:**
- The trial judge directed the jury to consider Counts 1 and 2 separately, but the prosecution's case was primarily based on the bribery charge, which was not accepted by some jurors.
- The defense argued that the trial judge's directions did not adequately address the alternative case for Count 2, which did not involve corruption.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case

**High-Level Official Involved:**
- The case involves a former Chief Executive of Hong Kong, which adds a significant level of public interest and scrutiny to the proceedings.

**Complexity of the Charges:**
- The case involves multiple charges and alternative theories of liability, making it a complex legal challenge for the prosecution and defense.

**Public Interest in the Outcome:**
- Given Tsang's high office, there was a strong public interest in the outcome of the case, which has implications for the integrity of public office in Hong Kong.

**Ambiguity in the Prosecution's Case:**
- The prosecution's case was ambiguous, particularly regarding the alternative theory of misconduct in public office without a finding of corruption. This ambiguity led to confusion in the jury's deliberations and the trial judge's directions.

**Significance of the Trial Judge's Directions:**
- The case highlights the critical importance of the trial judge's directions in ensuring a fair trial, particularly in complex cases involving multiple charges and alternative theories of liability.

**Public Perception and Media Scrutiny:**
- The case was heavily scrutinized by the media and public, which added pressure to the legal proceedings and influenced public perception of the case. 

These aspects make the case remarkable not only for its legal implications but also for its broader societal and political context. [end of text]
