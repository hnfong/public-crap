### 1. Summary of the Facts

This case, *Ng Ka Ling and Another v. The Director of Immigration* [1999] HKCFA 72, revolves around the legal status of Chinese nationals born on the Mainland whose parents were Hong Kong permanent residents. The applicants, including two sisters and a man, claimed to be permanent residents under the third category of Article 24(2) of the Basic Law, which grants the right of abode in Hong Kong. They arrived in Hong Kong on or before 1 July 1997, the date when Hong Kong reverted to Chinese sovereignty. However, the Director of Immigration denied their claims, arguing that they did not meet the criteria set out in the Immigration (Amendment) (No 3) Ordinance, which required them to hold a "one way permit" affixed with a certificate of entitlement issued by the Hong Kong authorities. The applicants challenged this decision through judicial review, arguing that they were entitled to the right of abode under the Basic Law and that the scheme introduced by the No 3 Ordinance was unconstitutional.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties

**Applicants' Position:**
The applicants argued that they were permanent residents under the third category of Article 24(2) of the Basic Law, which grants the right of abode in Hong Kong. They contended that the scheme introduced by the No 3 Ordinance, requiring them to hold a "one way permit" affixed with a certificate of entitlement, was unconstitutional. They claimed that the Basic Law guarantees the right of abode for permanent residents, and that the requirement to obtain a permit from the Mainland was an unnecessary and arbitrary restriction. Additionally, they argued that the retrospective application of the No 3 Ordinance violated their constitutional rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), particularly Article 15(1), which prohibits retroactive criminalization. They also challenged the exclusion of children born out of wedlock from the third category, arguing that it violated the principle of equality.

**Director of Immigration's Position:**
The Director of Immigration argued that the applicants were subject to the scheme introduced by the No 3 Ordinance, which required them to hold a "one way permit" affixed with a certificate of entitlement. He maintained that the Basic Law, particularly Article 22(4), which regulates entry from other parts of China, required Mainland authorities to approve entry into Hong Kong. He also argued that the retrospective application of the No 3 Ordinance was constitutional and that the exclusion of children born out of wedlock was consistent with the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law. The Director further contended that the applicants' claims were not valid under the third category of Article 24(2) due to the birth out of wedlock issue.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) of the Case

The case presents a significant constitutional and legal challenge to the interpretation of the Basic Law and the rights of permanent residents in Hong Kong. The Court of Final Appeal delivered a detailed and thorough analysis of the legal principles involved, which can be summarized as follows:

#### **Constitutional Jurisdiction of the Courts**
The Court held that the courts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have the constitutional jurisdiction to interpret the Basic Law, including provisions that may be within the limits of the Region's autonomy. This jurisdiction is derived from the Basic Law itself, which is the constitution of the Region. The Court emphasized that the courts have the duty to ensure that laws and executive actions are consistent with the Basic Law, and that they are not bound by the limitations on judicial review that existed under the previous colonial regime. The Court rejected the argument that the courts could not question the validity of acts of the National People's Congress, as such acts are considered sovereign and not subject to judicial review.

#### **Interpretation of the Basic Law**
The Court adopted a purposive approach to interpreting the Basic Law, emphasizing that the document is a living instrument designed to implement the principle of "one country, two systems." The Court stressed that the Basic Law is not a rigid legal code but a constitutional framework that must be interpreted in light of its purpose, context, and the principles enshrined in it, including the right to equality and the protection of fundamental rights. The Court held that the right of abode under Article 24(3) is a core constitutional right that cannot be arbitrarily restricted by the Mainland authorities or by the Hong Kong legislature.

#### **Constitutionality of the No 3 Ordinance**
The Court found that the No 3 Ordinance, which introduced a scheme requiring permanent residents to hold a "one way permit" affixed with a certificate of entitlement, was unconstitutional. The Court held that the requirement to obtain a permit from the Mainland was an unnecessary and arbitrary restriction on the right of abode, which is a fundamental constitutional right. The Court also ruled that the retrospective application of the No 3 Ordinance was unconstitutional, as it violated the principle of non-retroactivity and the ICCPR. The Court further held that the exclusion of children born out of wedlock from the third category of Article 24(2) was unconstitutional, as it violated the principle of equality and the right to family life.

#### **Separation of Powers and Autonomy**
The Court emphasized that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has a high degree of autonomy, and that the courts have the authority to interpret the Basic Law and ensure that laws and executive actions are consistent with it. The Court rejected the argument that the courts could not interpret provisions of the Basic Law that relate to the relationship between the Central Authorities and the Region, as such provisions are not excluded from judicial review. The Court held that the courts have the authority to interpret the Basic Law in accordance with its purpose and the principles enshrined in it, including the protection of fundamental rights.

#### **Application of the ICCPR**
The Court held that the ICCPR, as applied to Hong Kong, remains in force and that the right of abode is protected under Article 15(1) of the ICCPR. The Court ruled that the retrospective application of the No 3 Ordinance was unconstitutional, as it violated the principle of non-retroactivity and the right to a fair trial. The Court also held that the exclusion of children born out of wedlock from the third category of Article 24(2) was unconstitutional, as it violated the principle of equality and the right to family life.

### 4. Anything Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable About the Case

This case is remarkable for several reasons. First, it represents one of the first major constitutional cases in the post-handover era of Hong Kong, dealing with the interpretation of the Basic Law and the rights of permanent residents. The case involved a complex interplay between the Basic Law, the Joint Declaration, and the laws of the Mainland, highlighting the unique constitutional framework of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Second, the case addressed the issue of the constitutional jurisdiction of the courts, which is a fundamental question in the new constitutional order. The Court's decision to assert the courts' authority to interpret the Basic Law and to challenge the constitutionality of laws and executive actions is a significant development in Hong Kong's constitutional jurisprudence. Third, the case dealt with the issue of the right of abode, a fundamental constitutional right, and the Court's decision to protect this right from arbitrary restrictions is a landmark ruling. Finally, the case involved a detailed analysis of the principles of equality and the right to family life, which are enshrined in the ICCPR and the Basic Law, and the Court's decision to uphold these principles is a significant contribution to the development of human rights law in Hong Kong.
