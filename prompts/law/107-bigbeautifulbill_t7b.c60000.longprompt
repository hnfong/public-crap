            ``(1) Date for payment of installments.--If an election is 
        made under subsection (a), the first installment shall be paid 
        on the due date (determined without regard to any extension of 
        time for filing the return) for the return of tax for the 
        taxable year in which the sale or exchange occurs and each 
        succeeding installment shall be paid on the due date (as so 
        determined) for the return of tax for the taxable year 
        following the taxable year with respect to which the preceding 
        installment was made.
            ``(2) Acceleration of payment.--
                    ``(A) In general.--If there is an addition to tax 
                for failure to timely pay any installment required 
                under this section, then the unpaid portion of all 
                remaining installments shall be due on the date of such 
                failure.
                    ``(B) Individuals.--In the case of an individual, 
                if the individual dies, then the unpaid portion of all 
                remaining installment shall be paid on the due date for 
                the return of tax for the taxable year in which the

                    ``(C) C corporations.--In the case of a taxpayer 
                which is a C corporation, trust, or estate, if there is 
                a liquidation or sale of substantially all the assets 
                of the taxpayer (including in a title 11 or similar 
                case), a cessation of business by the taxpayer (in the 
                case of a C corporation), or any similar circumstance, 
                then the unpaid portion of all remaining installments 
                shall be due on the date of such event (or in the case 
                of a title 11 or similar case, the day before the 
                petition is filed). The preceding sentence shall not 
                apply to the sale of substantially all the assets of a 
                taxpayer to a buyer if such buyer enters into an 
                agreement with the Secretary under which such buyer is 
                liable for the remaining installments due under this 
                subsection in the same manner as if such buyer were the 
                taxpayer.

        election is made under subsection (a) to pay the applicable net 
        tax liability in installments and a deficiency has been 
        assessed with respect to such applicable net tax liability, the 
        deficiency shall be prorated to the installments payable under 
        subsection (a). The part of the deficiency so prorated to any 
        installment the date for payment of which has not arrived shall 
        be collected at the same time as, and as a part of, such 
        installment. The part of the deficiency so prorated to any 
        installment the date for payment of which has arrived shall be 
        paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary. This section 
        shall not apply if the deficiency is due to negligence, to 
        intentional disregard of rules and regulations, or to fraud 
        with intent to evade tax.
