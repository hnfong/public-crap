The user asks: "This is a huge bill, championed by President Donald Trump, passed by Congress recently. Help me understand the Bill by giving me a summary of the changes for every section 'Sec. XXXX' in the Bill."

We have a bill text. The user wants a summary for each section Sec. XXXX. The bill is a reconciliation bill (H.R. 1) that includes many sections. The user wants a summary for each section, with at most one paragraph, at most 4 sentences, minimum 1 sentence, specific to parties, entities, and quantities, concise but not vague, keep all significant details.

We need to parse the bill text. The bill is a reconciliation bill (H. Con. Res. 14). It includes Title I (Agriculture, Nutrition, Forestry), Title II (Armed Services). The user wants summary for each section Sec. XXXX. The bill includes many sections: Sec. 20001 to Sec. 20013. Also Title I sections: Sec. 10101 to Sec. 10314, etc. The user only gave the text for Sec. 20001 to Sec. 20013. The user says "Start with Sec. 20001." So we need to provide summary for each of those sections.

We need to be careful: The bill is a huge bill, but the user only gave the text for Title II (Armed Services) sections. The Title I sections are also part of the bill, but the user didn't provide them. The user says "For every Section ('Sec.') in the Bill."
