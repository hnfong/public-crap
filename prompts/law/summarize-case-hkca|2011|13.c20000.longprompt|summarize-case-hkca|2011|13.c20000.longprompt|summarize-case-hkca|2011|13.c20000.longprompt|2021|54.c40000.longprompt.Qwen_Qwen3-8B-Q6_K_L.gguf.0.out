### 1. **Summary of the Facts**

This case, *KWOK CHEUK KIN AND ANOTHER v. DIRECTOR OF LANDS AND OTHERS [2021] HKCA 54; CACV 317/2019*, revolves around the constitutionality of the **New Territories Small House Policy (Small House Policy)** in Hong Kong. The policy, introduced in 1972, allows male indigenous villagers in the New Territories to apply for permission to build a small house on land they own or obtain from the government, subject to certain conditions. The policy has been criticized for its **discriminatory nature**, as it excludes women and non-indigenous residents, and for its **inherent inequality** based on **social origin and sex**.

The applicants challenged the policy on the grounds that it violates **articles 25 and 39 of the Basic Law** (BL25 and BL39) and **article 22 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights (BOR22)**, which prohibit discrimination and protect fundamental rights. They argued that the policy is **unlawful** and **unconstitutional**. The respondents and the interested party, however, defended the policy, asserting that it is a **lawful traditional right** of the New Territories indigenous inhabitants (NTIIs) under **BL40**, which guarantees the protection of their traditional rights and interests.

The case was heard in the High Court, where the judge ruled that the Small House Policy is **discriminatory** and **unconstitutional** in part, but **constitutional in full** under **BL40**. The judge concluded that only the **free building licence** form of the policy qualifies as a **lawful traditional right**, while **private treaty grant** and **exchange** do not. The applicants appealed this decision, and the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) overturned the lower court’s judgment, affirming that the Small House Policy is **constitutional in its entirety** under **BL40**.

### 2. **Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties**

**Applicants (Challenging the Policy):**  
The applicants argued that the Small House Policy is **discriminatory** and **unlawful** under the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. They contended that the policy violates **BL25** (equality), **BL39** (right to freedom of movement and residence), and **BOR22** (prohibition of discrimination). They also claimed that the policy is **not a lawful traditional right** under **BL40**, as it is **not traceable to pre-1898 customs** and is **not lawful under Hong Kong law**. The applicants further argued that the policy should be **struck down** in its entirety and that the **Small House Policy should be reformed** to be more inclusive and equitable.

**Respondents and Interested Party (Defending the Policy):**  
The respondents and the interested party argued that the Small House Policy is a **lawful traditional right** of the NTIIs under **BL40**, and therefore **constitutional**. They contended that the policy is **not discriminatory** in the context of **BL40**, as it is **protected by the Basic Law** and **recognized in the legal system**. They emphasized that the policy has been **recognized in legislation** and **historical practice** since the 19th century and that it is **part of the legal tradition** of the NTIIs. They also argued that the **Small House Policy should be upheld** as it is **part of the legal and administrative framework** of Hong Kong and that **BL40 protects it** from being challenged on grounds of discrimination.

### 3. **Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) of the Case**

The **ratio decidendi** of this case lies in the **interpretation of BL40** and the **constitutional protection of traditional rights** of the New Territories indigenous inhabitants. The Court of Final Appeal held that the **Small House Policy is constitutional in its entirety**, despite its **discriminatory nature**, because it is **protected as a lawful traditional right** under **BL40**.

#### **A. The Meaning of "Lawful Traditional Rights and Interests" in BL40**

The Court emphasized that **BL40** protects **lawful traditional rights and interests** of the NTIIs, which are defined as:

1. **Traditional**: Rights that **trace back to pre-1898 customs** and **practices** of the NTIIs. These rights must have **historical continuity** and **essential features** that reflect the **customary practices** of the NTIIs before the New Territories Lease in 1898.
2. **Lawful**: Rights that are **recognized and protected by the legal system** at the time of the Basic Law’s promulgation (April 1990). They must not be **unlawful under Hong Kong law** or **contrary to the Basic Law**.

The Court rejected the applicants’ argument that the policy must be **lawful under Qing law** or **pre-1997 law**, emphasizing that **BL40 is not concerned with the legality of the rights under pre-1997 law**, but rather with their **continuity and recognition** in the legal system after 1997.

#### **B. The Scope of BL40 and the Protection of the Small House Policy**

The Court held that the **Small House Policy is a lawful traditional right** of the NTIIs, as it has been **recognized in legislation**, **historical practice**, and **legal tradition** since the 19th century. The policy includes **three forms of land grants**: **free building licence**, **private treaty grant**, and **exchange**. The Court ruled that **only free building licence** qualifies as a **lawful traditional right**, while **private treaty grant and exchange** do not, as they **do not trace back to pre-1898 customs** and **lack the essential features** of traditional rights.

However, the Court **overturned the lower court’s decision** and held that the **Small House Policy is constitutional in its entirety** under **BL40**, despite its **discriminatory nature**. The Court emphasized that **BL40 protects the policy as a traditional right**, and that **the discriminatory nature of the policy does not invalidate it** under the Basic Law.

#### **C. The Role of the Joint Declaration and Annex III**

The Court also considered the **Joint Declaration** and **Annex III**, which **preserved the rights of the NTIIs** in the New Territories, including the **Small House Policy**. The Court held that the **Small House Policy is protected under Annex III**, which **ensures the continuation of land rights** granted before 1 July 1997. The Court emphasized that the **Small House Policy is part of the legal and administrative framework** of Hong Kong and that **BL40 protects it from being challenged on grounds of discrimination**.

#### **D. The Coherence Principle and the Interpretation of the Basic Law**

The Court applied the **coherence principle**, which requires that the **Basic Law be interpreted as a coherent whole**. The Court held that **BL40 must be read together with BL120 and BL122**, which **protect the rights of the NTIIs** under the **Joint Declaration**. The Court emphasized that the **Small House Policy is part of the legal tradition** of the NTIIs and that **BL40 protects it from being challenged on grounds of discrimination**.

#### **E. The Role of the CEDAW Reservations**

The Court also considered the **CEDAW reservations** made by the UK and PRC Governments, which **exempt the Small House Policy from the operation of CEDAW**. The Court held that the **CEDAW reservations** are a **weighty aid to the interpretation of the Basic Law** and that the **Small House Policy is protected under BL40** despite its **discriminatory nature**.
