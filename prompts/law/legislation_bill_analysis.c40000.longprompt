Protection of Critical Infrastructures (Computer Systems) Bill
C2929
(b) the infrastructure is a specified critical infrastructure
for the Commissioner.

(5) In considering whether to designate an organization as a
CI operator or whether to revoke such a designation, a
regulating authority may take into account—
(a) how dependent the core function of the critical
infrastructure concerned is on computer systems;
(b) the sensitivity of the digital data controlled by the
organization in respect of the infrastructure;
(c) the extent of control that the organization has over
the operation and management of the infrastructure;
(d) any information provided in respect of the
infrastructure for compliance with a requirement
under Division 2; and

infrastructure operated by the operator,
as a critical computer system for the infrastructure.

(3) In considering whether to designate a computer system
(subject system) as a critical computer system or whether
to revoke such a designation, a regulating authority may
take into account—

function of the critical infrastructure concerned;
(b) how such a core function would be impacted if the
subject system is disrupted or destroyed;
(c) the extent to which the subject system is related to
any other computer systems of the CI operator
concerned;
(d) the extent to which the subject system and any other
computer systems of the operator are related to those
of other CI operators;

Part 3—Division 2
Clause 14
Protection of Critical Infrastructures (Computer Systems) Bill
C2933

infrastructure for compliance with a requirement
under Division 2; and
