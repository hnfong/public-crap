Got it, let's tackle these tasks one by one. First, I need to make sure I understand the case thoroughly. Let's start with the facts.

### 1. Facts of the Case  
The case involves President Trump using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, China, and other countries, citing two national emergencies: drug trafficking and large trade deficits. The plaintiffs—small businesses (Learning Resources) and others (V.O.S. Selections)—sued, arguing IEEPA doesn't authorize tariffs. Lower courts (D.C. Circuit and Federal Circuit) agreed, holding IEEPA's grant to "regulate importation" doesn't include tariffs. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and consolidated the cases.

### 2. Arguments of the Two Parties  
**Plaintiffs (Petitioners):** IEEPA does not authorize tariffs. The key provision, 50 U.S.C. §1702(a)(1)(B), allows the President to "regulate... importation," but "regulate" doesn't include taxing/tariffing. Tariffs are a core congressional power (Article I, §8) not delegable to the President via ambiguous IEEPA language. The major questions doctrine requires clear congressional authorization, which is lacking here.  

**Government (Respondents):** IEEPA explicitly authorizes tariffs. "Regulate importation" historically includes tariffs, as confirmed by President Nixon's 1971 tariffs under IEEPA's predecessor (Trading with the Enemy Act) and the Supreme Court's 1976 decision in *Federal Energy Administration v. Algonquin SNG* (upholding similar "adjust imports" language as including monetary exactions). Congress intended IEEPA to grant broad emergency authority, and tariffs are a traditional tool to regulate imports.

### 3. Majority Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The majority (Chief Justice Roberts, joined by Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, Barrett, Jackson) held IEEPA does not authorize tariffs, relying on statutory interpretation, separation of powers, and the major questions doctrine. Key points:  

#### a. Statutory Interpretation: "Regulate Importation" Does Not Include Tariffs  
The majority focused on the text of IEEPA: §1702(a)(1)(B) authorizes the President to "investigate, block... regulate... importation," but "regulate" (as defined in Black’s Law Dictionary) means "control by rule," not "tax." Tariffs are a form of taxation (raising revenue), which is distinct from regulation. Congress consistently uses specific terms like "duty" or "tariff" when delegating tariff power (e.g., 19 U.S.C. §§1338, 2132), not the generic "regulate."  

#### b. Historical Practice and Context  
Congress has never used "regulate importation" to delegate tariff power; it reserves tariff authority for explicit statutory grants with limits (e.g., caps on duration/amount, procedural requirements). No President before Trump invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs, despite IEEPA’s 50-year history. This "lack of historical precedent" supports limiting IEEPA’s scope.  

#### c. Major Questions Doctrine  
The majority applied the major questions doctrine, which requires "clear congressional authorization" for executive actions of major economic/political significance. Here, the President claimed an "unheralded" power (tariffs via IEEPA) with vast stakes (trillions in economic impact). Since IEEPA’s text is ambiguous and Congress typically delegates tariff power explicitly, the President failed to show clear authorization.  

#### d. Separation of Powers  
Article I vests the taxing power (including tariffs) in Congress alone. The Framers ensured Congress, not the President, controls the purse strings to prevent executive overreach. Delegating tariff power via ambiguous IEEPA language would undermine this separation.

### 4. Dissenting Legal Principles and Arguments  
The dissent (Kavanaugh, joined by Thomas, Alito) disagreed, arguing IEEPA clearly authorizes tariffs and the major questions doctrine doesn’t apply in foreign affairs. Key points:  

#### a. Statutory Interpretation: "Regulate Importation" Includes Tariffs  
Tariffs are a traditional means of regulating importation. Dictionaries (e.g., Black’s) define "regulate" as "control by rule," which includes tariffs. Precedent (*Algonquin SNG*) upheld similar "adjust imports" language as including monetary exactions (tariffs). President Nixon’s 1971 tariffs under TWEA (IEEPA’s predecessor) were upheld, and Congress reenacted the same "regulate importation" language in IEEPA, knowing it covered tariffs.  

#### b. Historical Practice  
Since the Founding, Presidents have imposed tariffs as a regulatory tool (e.g., Polk, Lincoln, McKinley, Nixon, Ford). Congress regularly delegates tariff authority to the President (e.g., Section 232, Trade Act of 1974), and IEEPA’s broad emergency authority includes tariffs as a flexible tool (less extreme than embargoes/quotas).  

#### c. Major Questions Doctrine Does Not Apply in Foreign Affairs  
The majority misapplied the major questions doctrine, which the Court has never used in foreign affairs. Congress intentionally delegates broad authority to the President in foreign policy/national security (per *Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.*), as narrow standards would hinder effective governance. Tariffs are a key foreign policy tool (negotiating leverage, national security), so the doctrine doesn’t require "magic words" (explicit "tariff" references) here.  

#### d. Nondelegation Doctrine Is Inapplicable  
The nondelegation doctrine is inapplicable to foreign affairs; Congress may broadly delegate power to the President there. IEEPA has sufficient limits (emergency declaration, 1-year sunset, congressional reporting), so it doesn’t violate nondelegation.

### 5. Striking/Unusual Aspects  
- **Split Application of Major Questions Doctrine:** The majority relied on the major questions doctrine, but three justices (Sotomayor, Kagan, Jackson) concurred only on statutory interpretation, not the doctrine. Kavanaugh’s dissent argued the doctrine shouldn’t apply to foreign affairs, a novel limitation.  
- **Historical Precedent Focus:** The case hinged heavily on historical uses of "regulate importation"—notably, whether Nixon’s 1971 tariffs (under TWEA) and *Algonquin* (1976) foreclosed the majority’s interpretation.  
- **Practical Consequences:** The decision could require refunding billions in tariffs, disrupting trade deals (e.g., with China, U.K., Japan) negotiated via IEEPA tariffs, despite the majority noting other statutes (e.g., Section 232) might still allow similar tariffs.  
- **Separation of Powers vs. Foreign Affairs Tension:** The core conflict was between the majority’s separation of powers concerns (protecting congressional tariff power) and the dissent’s foreign affairs deference (presidential flexibility in trade policy).  

Additionally, Justice Thomas’s dissent went further, arguing the nondelegation doctrine doesn’t apply to tariff power at all (as it’s a "privilege," not a right, so no due process issue), making the majority’s separation of powers argument irrelevant.</seed:think>### 1. Facts of the Case  
President Trump invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, China, and other nations, citing two national emergencies: drug trafficking and large U.S. trade deficits. The tariffs included 25% duties on Canadian/Mexican goods, 10–84% on Chinese goods, and 10%+ on most global imports. Plaintiffs—small businesses (Learning Resources) and states/businesses (V.O.S. Selections)—sued, arguing IEEPA does not authorize tariffs. Lower courts (D.C. Circuit and Federal Circuit) agreed, holding IEEPA’s grant to "regulate importation" does not include tariffing. The Supreme Court consolidated the cases and reviewed whether IEEPA permits tariffs.


### 2. Arguments of the Parties  
**Plaintiffs:** IEEPA does not authorize tariffs. The key provision, 50 U.S.C. §1702(a)(1)(B), allows the President to "regulate... importation," but "regulate" (meaning "control by rule," not "tax") does not encompass tariffs. Tariffs are a core congressional power (Article I, §8) reserved for explicit statutory delegation, not ambiguous IEEPA language. The "major questions doctrine" requires clear congressional authorization for such economically significant actions, which is absent here.  

**Government:** IEEPA explicitly authorizes tariffs. "Regulate importation" historically includes tariffs, as confirmed by President Nixon’s 1971 tariffs under IEEPA’s predecessor (Trading with the Enemy Act) and the Supreme Court’s *Federal Energy Administration v.

Congress intended IEEPA to grant broad emergency authority, and tariffs are a traditional tool to regulate imports.


### 3. Majority Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The majority (6–3) held IEEPA does not authorize tariffs, relying on statutory text, historical practice, separation of powers, and the major questions doctrine. Key holdings:

Congress has never used "regulate importation" to delegate tariff authority; it reserves tariff power for explicit statutes with limits (e.g., duration/cap provisions, procedural requirements). No President before Trump invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs in its 50-year history, indicating Congress did not intend this.  

#### c. Major Questions Doctrine  
The majority applied the major questions doctrine, which requires "clear congressional authorization" for executive actions of major economic/political significance. Here, the President claimed an "unheralded" power (tariffs via IEEPA) with trillions in economic stakes.
