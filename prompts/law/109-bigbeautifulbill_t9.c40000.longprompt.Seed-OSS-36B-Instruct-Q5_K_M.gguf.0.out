Got it, let's tackle this. The user wants summaries for each Sec. XXXX from the provided bill text, starting with 90001. First, I need to go through each section one by one, extract the key points: who gets the money, how much, what for, any restrictions or definitions.

Starting with Sec. 90001: Border infrastructure and wall system. It's $46.55 billion for CBP, FY2025, available until 2029. Uses include new/replacement barriers (primary, waterborne, secondary), access roads, barrier attributes (cameras, lights, sensors), and ground prep for operations. That's straightforward—list the amount, entity, time frame, and specific uses.

Sec. 90002: CBP personnel, fleet, facilities. Breaks down into personnel ($4.1B for hiring/training agents, officers, etc.), retention/hiring bonuses ($2.05B), vehicles ($855M for repair/lease/acquisition), facilities ($5B for lease/construction/improvement). Restriction: no funds for processing coordinators after 10/31/2028. Need to hit the subsections but keep concise.

Sec. 90003: Detention capacity. $45B to ICE FY2025, available until 2029, for single adult and family residential center (FRC) detention. FRCs hold families (including alien children not UAC) pending removal decisions/until removed. Standards for single adult detention set by DHS Secretary. Define FRC here—important to include the definition since it's specific.

Sec. 90004: Border security tech and screening. $6.168B to CBP FY2025, until 2029. Uses: nonintrusive inspection tech (AI, ML) at ports/borders, Air/Marine upgrades, surveillance tech, biometric entry/exit systems, screening of entrants/exits, UAC initial screenings (per Wilberforce Act), combating fentanyl/precursors, and border security events. Restriction: no surveillance towers without CBP testing/acceptance for autonomous capabilities (define "autonomous" as AI/ML systems operating without continuous human control).

Sec. 90005: State and local assistance. Two parts: State Homeland Security Grant Program (FEMA admin) – $500M for UAS detection, $625M 2026 World Cup, $1B 2028 Olympics, $450M Operation Stonegarden; waivers for World Cup/Olympic funds from certain HS Act requirements. State Border Security Reinforcement Fund (DHS) – $10B FY2025, until 2034, for state/local grants: border barriers/buoys, ground prep, detecting illicit substances/criminals, relocating unauthorized aliens from small centers. Eligibility: post-2021 activities, apps due 90 days post-enactment. Restriction: states can't exercise exclusive federal immigration/authorship. FEMA uses ≤1% for admin.

Sec. 90006: Presidential residence protection. $300M to FEMA FY2025, until 2029, to reimburse state/local agencies for extraordinary law enforcement costs for Secret Service-protected presidential residences (designated under 1976 Act). Must be excess of typical costs, directly attributable, post-7/1/2024, certified by Secret Service. FEMA uses ≤3% for admin.

Sec. 90007: DHS border support appropriations. $10B to DHS Sec FY2025, until 2029, for reimbursing border support activity costs.

Subtitle B: Sec. 90101: FEHB Improvements (FEHB Protection Act). OPM must issue regs by 1yr post-enactment to verify qualifying life events and family member eligibility for FEHB. Fraud risk assessments must include ineligible enrollees. 3-year audit (starting 1yr post) of family members using marriage/birth certificates. 180-day process for disenrolling ineligible individuals. Amends 5 U.S.C. 8909: FY2026 $66M from contributions (until 2035) for OPM to carry out these provisions; waives annual Congressionally specified limits on the subsection (b)(2) set-aside.

Sec. 90102: Pandemic Response Accountability Committee. $88M FY2026 for PRAC to oversee COVID-19 response and funds from this Act/other COVID Acts. Amends CARES Act Sec. 15010(a)(6) to include this reconciliation Act in PRAC oversight; extends Sec. 15010(k) from 2025 to 2034.

Sec. 90103: OMB appropriation. $100M to OMB FY2025, until 2029, for executive branch budget/accounting efficiency efforts.

Need to ensure each is 1-4 sentences, specific on parties (CBP, ICE, FEMA, DHS, OPM, PRAC), entities (states, locals, tribes), quantities ($ amounts, time frames), and significant details (restrictions, definitions, amendments). Avoid vagueness—e.g., not just "border wall" but "new or replacement primary, waterborne, and secondary barriers" as in 90001. Check that all key points from the text are included: e.g., 90003's FRC definition, 90004's autonomous tech restriction, 90005's World Cup/Olympic funds, 90101's audit and disenrollment timelines.</seed:think>### Sec. 90001.
