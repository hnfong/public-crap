### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case, *Secretary for Justice v. Chan Chi Wan Stephen* [2017] HKCFA 15, concerns the interpretation of **section 9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (Cap 201)** ("POBO"), which criminalizes corrupt transactions between agents and third parties. The appellants—Stephen Chan Chi Wan ("Chan"), a senior TVB executive, and Tseng Pei Kun ("Tseng"), his agent—were charged with conspiring to commit a section 9 offence, or alternatively, with the substantive offences of accepting and offering an advantage.

Chan was employed by Television Broadcasts Ltd ("TVB") as General Manager (Broadcasting), a senior administrative role. Although not required to appear on camera, he hosted a popular talk show on TVB’s pay channel called *Be My Guest* (literally "Chi Wan’s Dinner Party"), which gained significant celebrity status. Between June 2008 and January 2010, Chan appeared at 20 external events, earning remuneration on 18 occasions.

Olympian City, a shopping mall, sponsored TVB’s New Year’s Eve Countdown show. In November 2009, they agreed to pay TVB $1.3 million for the event. They then proposed adding a live, staged version of *Be My Guest* as a segment, which TVB agreed to. However, TVB did not arrange Chan’s participation; instead, Olympian City contacted Tseng, who acted as Chan’s agent, and entered into a contract with IEAP (Tseng’s company) for Chan to appear, with Chan receiving $112,000 and Lai Yiu Cheung (the guest) $20,000, while IEAP kept $28,000.

Chan did not seek or obtain TVB’s permission to accept this payment, despite his contract requiring it. However, TVB was aware that Chan would be appearing in the show, as it was part of the broadcast. The special edition aired on 31 December 2009, and all parties received their payments.

The prosecution charged Chan with accepting an advantage (section 9(1)(a)) and Tseng with offering it (section 9(2)(a)), both as part of a conspiracy. The trial judge initially acquitted them, but the Court of Appeal overturned this, finding that Chan’s act was “in relation to TVB’s affairs or business” and that he lacked a reasonable excuse. The Court of Appeal convicted both and imposed fines. The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) ultimately allowed the appeals, quashing the convictions.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties

#### **Appellants’ Arguments (Chan and Tseng):**
- **Chan’s act was not “in relation to TVB’s affairs or business”:** The appellants argued that Chan’s participation was purely personal, as a celebrity or artiste, not as an agent of TVB. His appearance was not intended to influence or affect TVB’s business, nor was it aimed at TVB. It was a moonlighting activity, and TVB had no interest in the arrangement.
- **No conflict of interest or harm to TVB:** The show was beneficial to TVB—boosting audience ratings and enhancing its brand. Chan did not misuse his position or power; he acted openly, and TVB knew about his involvement.
- **Reasonable excuse:** Chan believed he had implied permission from TVB, given that his participation was discussed in production meetings and TVB did not object. His failure to follow procedure was procedural, not corrupt.
- **Misapplication of Ch’ng Poh:** The Court of Appeal misinterpreted *Commissioner of ICAC v Ch’ng Poh* by treating any connection to TVB’s programming as sufficient. The real test is whether the act was *intended to influence or affect* the principal’s affairs, not merely related to them.

#### **Respondent’s (Prosecution) Arguments:**
- **The act was “in relation to TVB’s affairs or business”:** The prosecution argued that since the *Be My Guest* segment was part of a TVB broadcast, and Chan was a key figure in the show, his participation was inherently tied to TVB’s business. The show’s popularity was a key reason Olympian City wanted it included.
- **The act was “aimed at” TVB:** The prosecution contended that if Chan had refused, TVB would have had to substitute the segment, potentially harming its relationship with Olympian City and affecting audience ratings. Thus, the act was aimed at TVB’s interests.
- **No reasonable excuse:** Chan had a contractual duty to seek permission, and he failed to do so. The fact that TVB knew about the appearance did not constitute consent.
- **Ch’ng Poh does not require adverse impact:** The prosecution maintained that the *Ch’ng Poh* principle does not require the agent’s act to be harmful or detrimental—only that it be “aimed at” or “influential” to the principal’s affairs.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) – Detailed and Thorough

The **ratio decidendi** of *Secretary for Justice v. Chan Chi Wan Stephen* is a landmark clarification of **section 9 of the POBO**, particularly the **meaning of “in relation to his principal’s affairs or business”** and the **mens rea required for conviction**. The Court of Final Appeal (CFA), in a unanimous judgment led by Mr Justice Ribeiro PJ, delivered a **nuanced, policy-driven, and principled interpretation** that significantly narrowed the scope of the offence, emphasizing **intent, harm, and the integrity of the agency relationship**.

#### **Core Legal Principle: The Act Must Be “Aimed at” and “Intended to Influence or Affect” the Principal’s Affairs**

The central legal principle established is that for an act to fall within the ambit of section 9, it must not merely be *related to* the principal’s affairs, but must have been **intended to influence or affect** them. This is derived from the **Privy Council’s decision in *Commissioner of ICAC v Ch’ng Poh* [1997] HKLRD 652**, where Lord Lloyd of Berwick held that the phrase “in relation to his principal’s affairs or business” is **restrictive** and requires that the agent’s act be **“aimed at” the principal** and **intended to influence or affect** the principal’s affairs.

Ribeiro PJ emphasized that this interpretation is not merely a matter of semantics but reflects the **legislative mischief** behind the POBO: to prevent **corruption that undermines the fiduciary relationship** between principal and agent. The section is not designed to criminalize all third-party payments to agents, but only those that **subvert the integrity of the agency relationship**—i.e., where the agent is induced to act in a way that compromises loyalty, trust, or confidentiality.

#### **The Requirement of Adverse Impact or Detriment to the Principal’s Interests**

This is the **most novel and controversial** aspect of the judgment. Ribeiro PJ held that **the act or forbearance must be detrimental to the principal’s interests**—not just neutral or beneficial. He rejected the Court of Appeal’s view that any influence, even beneficial, suffices.

He argued that **if the act is beneficial to the principal**, it cannot be considered a corrupt transaction under section 9. To hold otherwise would **criminalize conduct that is entirely consistent with the principal’s interests**, which would be absurd and contrary to the purpose of the law. The CFA distinguished between:
- **Beneficial acts** (e.g., boosting ratings, enhancing reputation), and
- **Corrupt acts** (e.g., secret commissions, favoritism, breach of confidentiality).

The latter undermine trust; the former do not. The law should not stigmatize agents for doing things that help their employers, even if done without permission.

This principle is grounded in **fiduciary law** and **the doctrine of secret commissions**. As Lord Parker CJ in *DPP v Morgan* [1970] 3 All ER 1053 stated, the core of the law is that **an agent cannot make a profit without the principal’s knowledge and consent**, regardless of whether the principal is harmed. But the **criminal law should not be used to punish such acts unless they are inherently corrupt**—i.e., when they involve **a breach of trust or a conflict of interest**.

#### **Mens Rea: Knowledge or Belief That the Advantage Was Provided for a Corrupt Purpose**

The CFA reaffirmed that **mens rea is essential** in all variants of section 9. For an agent to be guilty of accepting an advantage, the prosecution must prove that the agent **knew or believed** the advantage was provided as an inducement or reward for an act in relation to the principal’s affairs.

This is a **high threshold**. It is not enough that the act *could* have influenced the principal’s affairs. The agent must have **intended or believed** that the payment was meant to influence or affect the principal’s business. This aligns with the principle that **criminal liability requires culpable mental state**, not mere negligence or ignorance.

The CFA rejected the Court of Appeal’s view that the agent’s act being “related to” the principal’s affairs is sufficient. Instead, the **intent of the offeror and the agent’s belief** must be examined. In this case, the offeror (Olympian City) was paying Chan to appear as a guest at a mall event—**not to influence TVB’s business**. There was no evidence that Tseng or OC intended the payment to affect TVB’s affairs. Thus, Chan could not have believed it was a corrupt inducement.

#### **The Role of “Reasonable Excuse” and the Burden of Proof**

The CFA also addressed the **defence of reasonable excuse** under section 24 of the POBO. While the Court of Appeal had ruled that the defence was not available because the act was “in relation to” TVB’s affairs, Ribeiro PJ held that **the defence only arises if the act prima facie constitutes an offence**.

Since the CFA concluded that the act was **not** in relation to TVB’s affairs (because it was not intended to influence or affect them), the **defence of reasonable excuse never arose**. The prosecution failed to prove the **actus reus** of the offence, so the burden of proof on excuse was irrelevant.

However, the CFA acknowledged that **reasonable excuse is broader than permission**. It includes situations where the agent **honestly believes** the principal would have consented, even if not formally granted. In this case, TVB’s knowledge of Chan’s participation and the absence of objection could support such a belief.

#### **The Misapplication of *Fung Hok Cheung* and the “Aimed at” Test**

The Court of Appeal had relied on *HKSAR v Fung Hok Cheung* [2008] 5 HKLRD 846, where a jockey was convicted for leaking confidential information to a third party. The Court of Appeal interpreted *Fung* as holding that **no adverse effect is required**—only that the act “influences or affects” the principal’s affairs.

Ribeiro PJ rejected this interpretation. He clarified that **Fung Hok Cheung did not hold that beneficial acts are criminal**. Instead, the court found that the jockey’s act **potentially damaged the trainer’s reputation**, which is a **form of detriment** to the principal’s interests. Thus, the case was about **reputational harm**, not mere influence.

The CFA emphasized that **“influence or affect” must be understood in the context of the agency relationship**—not just any causal connection. The act must be **intended to influence or affect** the principal’s affairs in a way that **undermines trust or loyalty**.

#### **Conspiracy and the Application of Section 24**

The CFA also addressed whether **section 24’s reverse onus** (on the accused to prove reasonable excuse) applies to **conspiracy charges**. The Court held that **it does not**. Conspiracy is a **common law offence** (or statutory under CO section 159A), not a POBO offence. Therefore, **section 24 does not apply** to conspiracy charges.

The prosecution must prove that the **agreement would necessarily result in a section 9 offence**—i.e., that the act would be done without lawful authority or reasonable excuse. But since the CFA had already concluded that the act was not in relation to TVB’s affairs, the conspiracy charge failed.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case

Several aspects of this case are **striking and remarkable**, both legally and culturally:

1. **A Celebrity Executive’s “Moonlighting” Became a Constitutional Issue**: The case turned on whether a **TV personality** hosting a popular talk show could be criminally prosecuted for accepting payment to appear on a **live segment of a TV broadcast**—a situation that, in real life, is common in entertainment. The idea that a **celebrity’s personal appearance** on a show they created could be deemed a “corrupt transaction” with their employer is **almost absurd**, yet it was seriously debated at the highest court level.

2. **The Court of Final Appeal’s Unusual Focus on “Benefit” to the Principal**: The CFA’s insistence that **beneficial acts cannot be corrupt** is **radically different** from the usual approach in corruption law, which often focuses on **intent and secrecy**. This case shows a **principled, policy-driven** interpretation that prioritizes **real-world consequences** over technical legalism.

3. **The Case Was Heard by the Full Court of the CFA**: The fact that **five judges** (including the President and Vice-Presidents) delivered judgments, with **three agreeing with Ribeiro PJ’s reasoning**, underscores the **importance and complexity** of the legal issues. It was not a routine appeal but a **constitutional-level interpretation** of a key anti-corruption law.

4. **The Cultural Significance of “Be My Guest”**: The show *Be My Guest* was not just a TV program—it was a **cultural phenomenon** in Hong Kong. Chan’s name was synonymous with it. The idea that a **celebrity’s personal brand** could be legally tied to their employer’s business in a way that triggers criminal liability is **unprecedented** and highlights the **tension between personal fame and corporate loyalty**.

5. **The Prosecution’s Overreach**: The prosecution’s argument that **any act related to the principal’s business**—even if beneficial and non-corrupt—could be criminalized, would have **chilled legitimate commercial activity**. The CFA’s rejection of this view is a **victory for common sense and proportionality** in criminal law.

6. **The Case Reflects Hong Kong’s Anti-Corruption Legacy**: The POBO was enacted in 1970 to combat systemic corruption. The CFA’s judgment shows that **the law must evolve**—not to criminalize every breach of procedure, but to **target real corruption**. This case is a **testament to the maturity of Hong Kong’s legal system**.

In sum, this case is remarkable not just for its legal complexity, but for its **human, cultural, and philosophical dimensions**—a rare moment when the law had to decide whether **a celebrity’s dinner party** could be a crime. [end of text]
