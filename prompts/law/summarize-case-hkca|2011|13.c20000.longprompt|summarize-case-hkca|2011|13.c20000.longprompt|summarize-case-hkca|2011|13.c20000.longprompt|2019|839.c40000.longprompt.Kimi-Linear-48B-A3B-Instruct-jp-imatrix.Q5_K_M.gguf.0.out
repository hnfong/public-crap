### TASK 1: Briefly summarize the facts of the above case.

The case is **HKSAR v. Wong Cho Shing and Others** (2019) HKCA 839. It involves seven former Hong Kong police officers convicted of assaulting a protester, Tsang Kin Chiu, during the 2014 "Occupy Central" protests. The assault occurred outside a government substation after Tsang was subdued and handcuffed. The officers allegedly threw him face-down onto the ground and beat him. Two separate charges were brought: (1) joint assault occasioning actual bodily harm (Charge 1), and (2) common assault (Charge 2) against D5. The trial judge found all seven guilty, sentencing each to two years' imprisonment. However, on appeal, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeals of D4 and D7 (quashing their convictions) and reduced the sentences of the others. The key legal issue revolved around the admissibility and authenticity of open-source video and photographic evidence, as well as the identification of the officers involved in the assault.

### TASK 2: Briefly summarize the arguments of the two parties.

**Prosecution (Respondent):**
- Argued that the video and photographic evidence was authentic and admissible, despite being open-source material.
- Claimed that the trial judge correctly admitted the evidence under the "prima facie authenticity" test, as established in *HKSAR v Lee Chi Fai*.
- Submitted that the judge’s findings of fact regarding identification were safe and supported by cumulative evidence, including Tsang’s own testimony.
- Contended that the sentences were appropriate, emphasizing the need for deterrence given the breach of trust by police officers.

**Appellants (Defendants):**
- Argued that the judge misapplied the test for admissibility, incorrectly requiring proof of authenticity beyond reasonable doubt instead of a prima facie standard.
- Challenged the identification of D4 and D7, arguing there was no witness identification or sufficient evidence linking them to the assault.
- Contended that the judge’s reliance on circumstantial evidence (e.g., clothing, proximity) was unsafe for D4 and D7.
- Argued that the sentences were excessive, especially for senior officers who did not directly participate in the assault.

### TASK 3: Summarize the legal principles (ratio decidendi) of the case. Be detailed and thorough.

#### **1. Admissibility and Authentication of Open-Source Video and Photographic Evidence**
The core legal issue was whether video and photographic evidence, sourced from the internet (Apple Daily, TVB, ATV, Now TV), could be admitted without calling the original creators or photographers to testify. The Court of Appeal affirmed the trial judge’s approach, which aligned with *HKSAR v Lee Chi Fai* and *R v Murphy*:

- **Prima Facie Authenticity Test**: The judge correctly applied the test from *Lee Chi Fai*, requiring only a prima facie case of authenticity (i.e., evidence defining the provenance and history of the recordings up to court). The prosecution did not need to prove authenticity beyond reasonable doubt at the admissibility stage.  
  - *Ratio*: Authentication is a threshold issue for the judge, not the jury. The judge must be satisfied that the evidence, if believed, could be sufficient to prove the matter beyond reasonable doubt.  
  - *Key Authority*: *R v Robson* (1972) clarified that the judge’s role is limited to ensuring a prima facie case; the jury decides ultimate guilt. The Court rejected the argument that the prosecution must prove authenticity on a balance of probabilities at the admissibility stage.

- **Circumstantial Authentication**: The judge admitted the evidence based on circumstantial factors:  
  - **TVB Footage**: PW9 (TVB technician) and PW10 (librarian) testified that the footage was unedited, transmitted live, and burned to Blu-ray discs without alteration. PW8 (news production manager) confirmed the footage was identical to the broadcast.  
  - **Apple Daily and ATV Footage**: Tsang identified himself in the footage, and police officers confirmed consistency with their recollection.  
  - **Now TV Footage**: Cross-referenced with police footage (Exhibit P8).  
  - **Photographs**: Tsang identified himself in Exhibits P12 and P13, and no challenge was made to his identification.  

- **No Requirement for Original Makers’ Testimony**: The Court emphasized that while calling the original cameraman is ideal, it is not mandatory if circumstantial evidence (e.g., timestamps, consistency with other footage) establishes authenticity.

#### **2. Identification of Appellants**
The Court upheld the judge’s identification of D1, D2, D3, and D5 but quashed convictions for D4 and D7 due to insufficient evidence.

- **D1**: Identified by SSP Chan (PW37) in multiple videos and photographs. His distinctive clothing (white shirt, black jacket, watch) was clearly visible. The judge’s analysis was supported by Tsang’s testimony that no one left the group escorting him, and D1’s role as officer-in-charge made his presence at the assault site compelling.  
- **D2**: Identified by CIP Chung (PW43) in multiple videos and photographs. His distinctive blue T-shirt and gloves were consistent across footage. The judge inferred his continued presence based on the short timeframe and lack of evidence he left the group.  
- **D3**: Identified by CIP Chung and others via his distinctive pink-striped shirt and gloves. The judge’s identification was corroborated by Tsang’s testimony and the continuity of the group.  
- **D5**: Identified by WSI Wu (PW39) and Tsang. His presence in the police vehicle with Tsang after the assault, and his distinctive shoes, supported the judge’s finding.  
- **D4 and D7**: Convictions quashed.  
  - **D4**: Not a member of QRT A2-2 and never identified by any witness. The judge’s self-identification was based on a partial view of a face in Exhibit P13, which was insufficient.  
  - **D7**: A member of QRT A2-2 but not identified in any footage. The judge relied on circumstantial evidence (e.g., wearing glasses) and proximity, but this was deemed too tenuous. The Court emphasized that identification must be based on witness testimony or clear visual evidence, not speculation.

#### **3. Sentencing Principles**
The Court reduced the sentences, holding that:  
- **Equal Culpability**: While all participants were guilty, senior officers (D1, D2) bore greater responsibility for failing to intervene.  
- **Deterrence**: Police officers must be deterred from abusing their authority, but the judge’s starting point of 30 months was deemed excessive.  
- **Mitigation**: The appellants’ long service and stress during the trial were considered, reducing sentences to 18, 18, 15, 16, and 15 months respectively.  
- **Consecutive Sentence for Charge 2**: The 1-month sentence for D5’s common assault was ordered to run consecutively, not concurrently, as it was a separate offence.

#### **4. Fresh Evidence Application**
D7’s application to adduce academic proof of his post-conviction studies was rejected. The Court held that such evidence was irrelevant to the appeal and would not affect the safety of the conviction.

### TASK 4: Is there anything striking, unusual or remarkable about the case?

Yes, several aspects are striking:

1. **Heavy Reliance on Open-Source Material**: The case is notable for its extensive use of internet-sourced video and photographs (Apple Daily, TVB, ATV, Now TV) as primary evidence. This is unusual in Hong Kong criminal trials, where original footage is typically preferred. The Court’s robust validation of such material, despite the absence of original creators, sets a precedent for digital evidence in criminal proceedings.

2. **Judge’s Self-Identification of D4 and D7**: The trial judge made explicit identifications of D4 and D7 without any witness testimony, relying solely on circumstantial evidence. This is highly unusual and controversial, as it effectively allowed the judge to act as a super-jury, determining guilt based on his own visual analysis rather than witness evidence. The Court of Appeal criticized this approach, emphasizing that identification must be grounded in witness testimony or clear, unambiguous footage.

3. **Complexity and Length of Proceedings**: The case involved seven defendants, multiple grounds of appeal, and intricate factual disputes over identification and evidence authenticity. The Court noted that the separate leave applications before a Single Judge were inefficient, leading to a 189-page judgment and prolonged litigation. This highlights systemic issues in managing complex appeals.

4. **Public Interest and Police Misconduct**: The case arose from the 2014 Occupy Central protests, a significant political event in Hong Kong. The conviction of police officers for assaulting a protester underscored tensions between law enforcement and civil liberties. The Court’s emphasis on deterrence and the breach of public trust in law enforcement officers added a layer of societal relevance.

5. **Legal Precedents on Digital Evidence**: The judgment provides a comprehensive framework for admitting and authenticating open-source video and photographic evidence, balancing the need for probative value with safeguards against tampering. This is particularly relevant in the digital age, where such evidence is increasingly common but legally contentious. [end of text]
