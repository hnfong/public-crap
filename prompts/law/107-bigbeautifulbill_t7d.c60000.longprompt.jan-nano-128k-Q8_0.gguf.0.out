Okay, I need to create a summary for each section of this bill, starting with Sec. 71101. The user wants each section summarized in a paragraph of at most four sentences, with specific details about parties, entities, and quantities. Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.

First, Sec. 71101 is about a moratorium on implementing a rule related to Medicare Savings Programs. The Secretary of Health and Human Services can't implement the rule from the CMS final rule published on September 21, 2023, which includes sections 406.21(c), 435.4, 435.601, 435.911, and 435.952. The moratorium is from the enactment date to September 30, 2034. There's $1 million appropriated for fiscal year 2026 to fund this.

So, the summary should mention the moratorium period, the specific sections of the CMS rule that are suspended, the entities involved (CMS, Secretary), and the funding amount. Let me check if I missed any details. The user wants specific parties, so the Secretary of HHS and CMS are key. The funding is $1 million for 2026. That's all in one paragraph, four sentences max.

Next, Sec. 71102 is a moratorium on a rule related to Medicaid, CHIP, and the Basic Health Program. The CMS rule from April 2, 2024, affects several sections of title 42 CFR. The moratorium is until September 30, 2034. The funding is $1 million for 2026. Need to mention the specific sections, the entities (CMS, Secretary), and the funding.

Then, Sec. 71103 is about reducing duplicate enrollment under Medicaid and CHIP. It adds new subsections to the Social Security Act, including a system to prevent enrollment under multiple states. The funding is $10 million for 2026 and $20 million for 2029. The system is established by the Secretary by October 1, 2029, and the funding is specified.

Sec. 71104 ensures deceased individuals don't remain enrolled. It adds a new subsection to the Social Security Act, requiring quarterly screening using the Death Master File. The State must disenroll deceased individuals and reinstate if there's an error. The funding is $1 million for 2026.

Sec. 71105 ensures deceased providers don't remain enrolled. It adds a check against the Death Master File for providers, starting in 2028, quarterly. The funding is $1 million for 2026.

Sec. 71107 requires eligibility redeterminations for certain individuals. The State must check eligibility every 6 months for those under section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII). The funding is $75 million for 2026 and 2027.

Sec. 71108 revises the home equity limit for long-term care under Medicaid. It changes the limit to $1 million for non-agricultural homes and allows states to use up to $1 million for certain homes. The effective date is 2028, and the funding is $7 million for 2026 and $10 million for 2029.
