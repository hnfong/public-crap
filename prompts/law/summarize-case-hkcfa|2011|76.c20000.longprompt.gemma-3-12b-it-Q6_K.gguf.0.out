## 1. Summary of Facts

*   **The Core Dispute:** The case, *Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v Chan Chun Chuen*, revolves around the validity of two wills of the late Nina Wang, a Hong Kong businesswoman and philanthropist. The Chinachem Charitable Foundation (the Foundation) seeks to have the 2002 will, which names it as the sole beneficiary, declared valid. Chan Chun Chuen (the Applicant) claims the 2006 will, which names him as the sole beneficiary and legatee, is the valid one and entitled him to Wang’s entire estate.
*   **The Wills:** The 2002 will was not disputed regarding its authenticity. The controversy centered solely on the 2006 will.
*   **Trial Outcome:** After a 40-day trial, the trial judge (Lam J) found the 2006 will to be a forgery. This decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal. The Applicant then sought leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal (CFA).
*   **The Application for Leave:** The Applicant's application to the CFA sought leave to appeal based on the grounds that the case involved property or civil rights exceeding $1,000,000 (either as of right or at the Court’s discretion) and/or raised a question of general or public importance.



## 2. Summary of Arguments

**A. The Applicant (Chan Chun Chuen):**

*   **As of Right - Property/Civil Right:** The Applicant argued that the case involved a claim to property or a civil right (the estate) exceeding $1,000,000, entitling him to an appeal as of right. He contended that probate cases are unique and should be treated differently. He also cited Commonwealth authorities (New Zealand and Australia) to support his interpretation of the relevant legislation.
*   **Important Question:** He further argued that the case raised a question of general or public importance, specifically concerning the Court's practice of refusing to review concurrent findings of fact.
*   **"Or Otherwise" Ground:**  He also argued that the Court of Appeal’s review of the trial judge’s findings was inadequate, failing to properly address certain inherent improbabilities, thus not constituting true concurrent findings.
*   **New Evidence:** He proposed to introduce new evidence (Police statements) that he claimed undermined the credibility of a key witness (Winfield Wong), potentially demonstrating a miscarriage of justice.

**B. The Chinachem Charitable Foundation (the Foundation):**

*   **Not As of Right - Property/Civil Right:** The Foundation argued that the Applicant’s claim was not a claim to a specific property or proprietary right, but rather a claim for a pronouncement on the validity of a will. Therefore, it did not qualify for an appeal as of right under the relevant legislation.
*   **Commonwealth Authorities Unpersuasive:** The Foundation argued that reliance on Commonwealth authorities was problematic and that the Court should consider its own context and role.
*   **Concurrent Findings:** The Foundation asserted that the Court’s practice of not reviewing concurrent findings of fact should be upheld and that the Applicant had not demonstrated any miscarriage of justice or violation of legal principles to warrant an exception.
*   **New Evidence Insufficient:** The Foundation argued that the proposed new evidence did not undermine the crucial findings of fact and did not establish a risk of miscarriage of justice.



## 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The Court of Final Appeal’s (CFA) decision in *Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v Chan Chun Chuen* primarily addresses the circumstances under which an appeal can be granted as of right in civil cases, particularly concerning the interpretation of section 22(1)(a) of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance. The case also touches upon the CFA’s established practice regarding concurrent findings of fact.

**A. Interpretation of Section 22(1)(a) - "As of Right" Ground**

The CFA reaffirmed and clarified the narrow construction of section 22(1)(a), which allows appeals "as of right" where the matter in dispute involves a claim or question to or respecting property or some civil right amounting to $1,000,000 or more. The key principles established and reiterated are:

*   **Not Applicable to Liquidated Monetary Claims:** The "as of right" provision applies only to claims for liquidated monetary sums. Probate claims, which involve determining the validity of a will and the distribution of an estate, are not within this category.
*   **Claim to Property or Proprietary Right Required:** To qualify for an appeal as of right, the claim must be a claim *to* a particular property or a proprietary right. A claim for a pronouncement on the validity of a will, even if it ultimately affects the distribution of property, is not a claim *to* that property itself. The focus is on the nature of the claim being asserted, not the eventual consequences of the appeal.
*   **"Directly or Indirectly" - Immediacy Requirement:** While the words "directly or indirectly" allow for claims that are not immediately apparent, they do not negate the requirement of *immediacy* in the economic consequences of the Court’s order. The order must have the immediate effect of conferring or imposing a quantified financial benefit or detriment exceeding $1,000,000.  A need for further adjudication or assessment to determine the financial impact disqualifies the claim.
*   **Rejection of Commonwealth Authority:** The CFA rejected the Applicant’s reliance on Commonwealth case law (New Zealand and Australia) arguing that such authorities are not binding and that the Court must consider its own context, role, and resources. The Court emphasized that the major Commonwealth jurisdictions have largely abandoned appeals as of right to their final appellate courts.

**B. Concurrent Findings of Fact and the CFA’s Practice**

The case also addressed the CFA’s established practice of being reluctant to review concurrent findings of fact made by the trial court and the Court of Appeal. The Court reaffirmed the rationale behind this practice, which stems from:

*   **Limiting the Court’s Role:** The CFA’s primary function is to determine points of law of general or public importance, not to re-hear factual disputes.
*   **Respect for Lower Courts:** The practice reflects a respect for the expertise and experience of the lower courts in fact-finding.
*   **Avoiding Attrition and Promoting Finality:** The practice helps to prevent prolonged litigation and promotes finality in legal proceedings.
*   **Exception for Miscarriage of Justice or Legal Violation:** The CFA will only intervene in concurrent findings of fact if there is a demonstrable miscarriage of justice or a violation of a principle of law or procedure. This requires a showing of a clear error that would render the outcome unjust.

**C. Analysis of the Applicant’s Arguments Regarding Concurrent Findings**

The CFA thoroughly analyzed the Applicant’s arguments challenging the Court of Appeal’s review of the trial judge’s findings:

*   **"Important Question" Ground Rejected:** The CFA rejected the argument that the case raised a question of general or public importance regarding the CFA’s practice on concurrent findings, finding no basis to overturn the established practice.
*   **Inadequate Review Rejected:** The CFA found that the Court of Appeal had adequately reviewed the trial judge’s findings and that the Applicant’s claim of an inadequate review was without merit.
*   **New Evidence Ground Rejected:** The CFA dismissed the Applicant’s attempt to introduce new evidence (Police statements) as failing to establish a risk of miscarriage of justice. The Court found that the new evidence did not undermine the crucial findings of fact regarding the validity of the 2002 will and the partial nature of the 2006 will.

**D. Novel and Controversial Points**

*   **Narrow Interpretation of "Property/Civil Right":** The CFA’s strict interpretation of "property or civil right" in the context of probate claims is a significant point. It reinforces the principle that a claim for a pronouncement on the validity of a will, while impacting the distribution of assets, is not a claim *to* those assets themselves. This interpretation limits the scope of appeals as of right in probate cases.
*   **Reaffirmation of CFA’s Deference to Lower Courts:** The strong reaffirmation of the CFA’s reluctance to review concurrent findings of fact underscores the Court’s commitment to its role as a final appellate court focused on legal issues rather than factual disputes. This stance, while promoting finality, can be seen as potentially limiting access to justice in cases where factual errors may have occurred.
*   **Call for Reconsideration of "As of Right" Appeals:** The CFA’s concluding observation that the “as of right” basis for appeals should be reconsidered is noteworthy. This suggests a potential shift in the Court’s approach to appeals in the future, aligning it more closely with the practices of other major Commonwealth jurisdictions.



In essence, *Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v Chan Chun Chuen* serves as a clear articulation of the CFA’s approach to appeals as of right and its commitment to upholding the established practice regarding concurrent findings of fact. The case reinforces the importance of a narrow interpretation of the relevant legislation and emphasizes the CFA’s role as a court of final appeal focused on legal principles rather than factual re-examinations.
