### 1. Summary of the Facts

On **15 October 2014**, during the **Occupy Central protests** in Hong Kong, a group of **Hong Kong Police Force officers** conducted an operation codenamed “Operation Solarpeak” to clear protesters from Lung Wo Road in Admiralty. **Tsang Kin Chiu**, a protestor, was seen splashing liquid from a bottle onto police officers below. After being subdued, he was handed over to a team of officers, including **seven appellants (D1 to D7)**, who were part of a Quick Response Team (QRT A2-2) or associated units.

The prosecution alleged that after being handed over, Tsang was **frogmarched**, then **lifted and carried face down** to a nearby substation, where he was **thrown onto the ground and assaulted by the appellants**. The assault involved kicking, stamping, and beating Tsang while he was defenseless, with his hands tied behind his back. The prosecution also alleged that **D5** slapped Tsang twice in **Interview Room 7** at Central Police Station after he refused to unlock his mobile phone.

All seven appellants were **convicted** in the District Court of **assault occasioning actual bodily harm** (Charge 1), with **D5** additionally convicted of **common assault** (Charge 2). They were each sentenced to **2 years’ imprisonment**.

The case hinged on **open-source video and photographic evidence** downloaded from the internet (from TVB, Apple Daily, ATV, Now TV, and others), which showed the events. The prosecution failed to obtain the original recordings or the identities of the cameramen due to a **refusal by Barnes J** to issue a Production Order under the *Interpretation and General Clauses Ordinance*. Despite this, the trial judge admitted the evidence, finding it **authentic and relevant**.

The appellants appealed on multiple grounds, including the **admissibility of open-source video**, **identification of individuals**, **standard of proof for authenticity**, and **sentencing**. The Court of Appeal ultimately **upheld convictions for D1–D3 and D5–D6**, but **quashed the convictions of D4 and D7** due to insufficient identification evidence. Sentences were **reduced** for all appellants.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties

#### **Prosecution (Respondent) Arguments:**
- The **video and photographic evidence** was **admissible** because it was **prima facie authentic**—supported by circumstantial evidence from TVB and ATV staff, the consistency of the footage with Tsang’s testimony, and the **lack of tampering**.
- The **standard of proof** for authenticity was **beyond reasonable doubt**, not the balance of probabilities. The judge correctly applied the **"if believed" test** from *HKSAR v Lee Chi Fai* and *R v Murphy*, which requires only that the evidence, if believed, would be sufficient to prove authenticity.
- **Tsang’s testimony** was crucial: he **identified himself** in the footage, confirmed the sequence of events, and said the videos matched his memory. His credibility was not entirely rejected—only parts of his account were disbelieved.
- The **TVB footage** was **not tampered with** because it was broadcast live or within hours, and internal checks by TVB staff confirmed the integrity of the original files.
- **D4 and D7’s convictions were unsafe** because **no witness identified them** in any footage, and the judge’s **self-identification** of them was **not reliable**.
- **All participants were equally culpable**—the senior officers (D1, D2) were not merely passive; they **approved** the assault by failing to intervene.
- The **sentences were appropriate** given the **deterrence value** and the **damage to police integrity**.

#### **Appellants’ Arguments:**
- The **video evidence was inadmissible** because the **prosecution failed to prove authenticity on a balance of probabilities**, not just prima facie.
- The **judge misdirected himself** by applying a “prima facie” test instead of requiring **clear proof of authenticity**.
- **No original recordings were produced**, and **no cameramen testified**, depriving the defence of meaningful cross-examination.
- **D4 and D7 were not identified** by any witness in any footage, and the judge’s **self-identification** was **unreliable**—especially given the poor quality of the images and the lack of a baseline for comparison.
- **D1 and D2** were not directly involved in the assault; they were **watching officers**, so their **culpability was less** than others.
- **D5’s conviction for common assault** was flawed because the judge **rejected Tsang’s earlier claim of assault** but **accepted his later claim** without explanation.
- The **sentences were excessive**, especially given the **stress of the protest**, the **long delay in trial**, and the **loss of careers and pensions**.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) – Detailed and Thorough

#### **A. Admissibility and Authentication of Open-Source Video Evidence**

The **central legal issue** was the **admissibility and authentication** of **open-source video and photographic evidence**—material downloaded from the internet, not produced by the police or the prosecution, and not accompanied by testimony from the original creators.

The Court of Appeal **affirmed the established test** from *HKSAR v Lee Chi Fai* [2003] 3 HKLRD 751, which itself followed *R v Murphy* [1990] NI 306. The **ratio decidendi** is that:

> **A video recording is admissible if it is relevant and prima facie authentic.**  
> **Prima facie authenticity** means that the prosecution must produce **some evidence** (not necessarily direct) that establishes a **credible chain of provenance and integrity**—such as the **timing of broadcast**, **internal checks by media organizations**, **comparison with other recordings**, or **corroboration by a witness**.

This is **not** a requirement to prove authenticity **on a balance of probabilities** at the admissibility stage. The **standard of proof** for admissibility is **not** the same as for **conviction**.

The Court **rejected the argument** that the **"balance of probabilities"** standard applies at the admissibility stage. It emphasized that **Robson v. Robson** [1972] 1 WLR 651, often cited for this argument, was **misunderstood**. Shaw J (later Sebag Shaw LJ) **did not require** the prosecution to prove authenticity on a balance of probabilities **at the admissibility stage**. Instead, he held that the judge must only be satisfied that a **prima facie case** of authenticity exists—**enough to allow the jury to consider the evidence**.

The Court cited **Cross & Tapper on Evidence** and **Phipson on Evidence**, both of which support the **"if believed" test**:  
> *“The test is whether the evidence, if believed by the jury, would be sufficient to prove the matter beyond reasonable doubt.”*

This is **not circular**—it is a **practical framework**:  
- **Step 1**: Is the evidence **relevant**? (If not, it’s inadmissible.)  
- **Step 2**: Is there **prima facie evidence** of authenticity? (If yes, it’s admissible.)  
- **Step 3**: The **jury** decides whether the evidence is **actually authentic** and whether it proves guilt **beyond reasonable doubt**.

This **distinction between admissibility and weight** is **crucial**. The **judge’s role** is **gatekeeping**, not **fact-finding**. The **jury** is the **ultimate arbiter** of authenticity and credibility.

#### **B. Authentication by Circumstantial Evidence and Comparison**

The Court **endorsed the use of circumstantial evidence** to authenticate video recordings, especially when the original creator is unavailable.

In *Murphy*, the Court held that a video can be authenticated by:
- Comparing it with **other videos of the same event**, taken at the same time or different times.
- Comparing it with **a film that is already proven authentic**.

In this case, the **TVB footage** was **not the only source**. The Court found that:
- The **TVB footage** was **broadcast live or within hours**, making tampering **highly unlikely**.
- **TVB staff** (PW8, PW9, PW10) testified that:
  - The footage was **automatically transmitted** to the server.
  - It was **burned onto Blu-ray discs unedited**.
  - The **contents of the discs matched the server files**.
  - The **original files were not accessible** to staff for editing.

This **internal verification** was **sufficient** to establish **prima facie authenticity**.

Moreover, the **Apple Daily, ATV, and Now TV footage** were authenticated by **comparison with the TVB footage** and **Tsang’s testimony**. The Court held that **if multiple sources show the same event**, and **the witness confirms the sequence**, then **the authenticity of the footage is established**.

This is a **novel and significant principle**:  
> **A video recording can be authenticated not by the testimony of the cameraman, but by the consistency of multiple independent sources and the corroboration of a central witness.**

This **expands the scope of admissible evidence** in the digital age, where **original footage may be lost or inaccessible**, but **multiple copies** exist online.

#### **C. The Role of the Witness in Authentication**

The Court emphasized that **Tsang’s testimony was pivotal**. He was **not just a witness**—he was **the central figure** in the footage.

He:
- **Identified himself** in the videos and photographs.
- **Confirmed the sequence of events** (arrest → frogmarch → carry → assault → transport).
- Said the footage **matched his memory**.

The Court held that **Tsang’s evidence alone** could have established **prima facie authenticity**, even without the TVB staff testimony. This is **controversial** because:
- He was **a suspect**.
- He had **a motive to lie**.
- He **did not disclose** three photos he claimed to have taken.

But the Court found that **his testimony was consistent**, **not contradicted by the footage**, and **supported by multiple sources**. Therefore, it was **credible enough** to support admissibility.

This **lowers the threshold** for authentication when the **witness is the subject** of the footage.

#### **D. Identification of Individuals in Video Evidence**

The Court **upheld the identification of D1–D3 and D5–D6** based on:
- **Witness identification** (e.g., CIP Chung, WSI Wu).
- **Clothing and accessories** (e.g., D2’s blue T-shirt, D3’s striped shirt, D5’s shoes).
- **Continuity of presence** (Tsang said **no one left the group**).
- **Contextual inference** (e.g., D2 was officer-in-charge; D6 was the arresting officer).

The Court **rejected the argument** that **identification must be facial**. It held that **distinctive clothing** can be sufficient, especially when:
- The person is **not facing the camera**.
- The **quality is poor**.
- The **context is clear**.

This is **a significant development** in digital evidence law:  
> **Identification can be based on clothing, posture, and context, not just facial features.**

However, the Court **rejected the identification of D4 and D7** because:
- **No witness identified them** in any footage.
- The **judge’s self-identification** was **not based on a prior identification**.
- The **evidence was too weak** to support a conviction **beyond reasonable doubt**.

This **sets a high bar** for self-identification:  
> **A judge cannot identify a defendant solely based on a partial view of a face in a low-quality image, especially when no witness has done so.**

This **protects against judicial overreach** and ensures **fair trial rights**.

#### **E. Sentencing Principles for Police Officers**

The Court **upheld the principle** that **police officers who break the law must be severely punished** to maintain **public confidence**.

It cited *HKSAR v Hui Man Tai* and *HKSAR v Lau Kwok*, which held that:
> **Police officers who abuse their power must be made examples** to deter others and protect the **integrity of the force**.

However, the Court **rejected the idea of equal culpability**. It held that:
- **Senior officers (D1, D2)** were **more culpable** for **failing to intervene**.
- **D3, D5, D6** were **direct participants**.
- Therefore, **sentences should reflect this hierarchy**.

The Court **reduced the sentences** from 2 years to:
- D1, D2: 18 months
- D3, D6: 15 months
- D5: 16 months (15 for assault, 1 for common assault **consecutive**)

This **nuanced approach** to sentencing is **novel and important**:  
> **Not all participants in a joint offence are equally culpable**, even if they are all convicted.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case

Several aspects of this case are **striking, unusual, or remarkable**:

#### **1. The Use of Internet-Uploaded Footage in a High-Profile Criminal Trial**
This case involved **video and photos downloaded from the internet**—not from police cameras or official sources. The **prosecution could not produce the original recordings** or the **cameramen**. Yet, the Court **admitted the evidence** based on **circumstantial proof** and **witness testimony**.

This **marks a turning point** in digital evidence law: **the internet is now a legitimate source of evidence**, even if the original is lost.

#### **2. The Judge’s Self-Identification of D4 and D7**
The trial judge **identified D4 and D7 from partial views of their faces** in low-quality footage—**without any prior witness identification**. This is **unusual and controversial**.

The Court of Appeal **rejected this**, calling it **unsafe** and **unreliable**. This is **a rare instance** where a judge’s **own visual identification** was **overruled**—highlighting the **importance of independent corroboration**.

#### **3. The Prosecution’s Failure to Appeal Barnes J’s Production Order Ruling**
The **Commissioner of Police** applied for a **Production Order** to compel the release of the original footage and the identities of the cameramen. **Barnes J refused**. The prosecution **did not appeal**.

This is **remarkable** because:
- The **evidence was critical**.
- The **failure to appeal** meant the **defence could not challenge the authenticity** of the original.
- Yet, the **Court of Appeal upheld the conviction** anyway.

This raises **serious questions** about **prosecutorial strategy** and **the duty to seek justice**, not just conviction.

#### **4. The Length and Complexity of the Case**
The trial lasted **31 days**, and the appeal involved **189 pages of judgment** from the Single Judge. The Court of Appeal **took months** to decide.

This is **unusual** for a criminal appeal—especially one involving **seven defendants** and **complex video evidence**. It shows the **growing complexity** of modern criminal trials.

#### **5. The Political Context**
The case occurred during the **Occupy Central protests**, a **highly sensitive political event**. The **police were under immense pressure**, and the **public was divided**.

Yet, the Court **did not shy away** from holding **officers accountable**, even if they were **under stress**. This **upholds the rule of law** over political sentiment.

#### **6. The Sentencing Reduction Despite the Seriousness of the Offence**
The Court **reduced the sentence from 2 years to 18 months**, even though the **offence was serious** and **damaged police integrity**.

This shows a **balance between deterrence and proportionality**—a **rare and commendable** judicial restraint.

### Conclusion

*HKSAR v Wong Cho Shing* is a **landmark case** in the **admissibility of digital evidence**, **authentication of open-source material**, and **identification in video footage**. It **clarifies the law** on **prima facie authenticity**, **the role of witnesses**, and **the limits of judicial identification**. It also **reinforces the principle** that **no one is above the law**, even police officers. The case is **remarkable** not just for its legal significance, but for its **real-world impact** on justice, technology, and public trust. [end of text]
