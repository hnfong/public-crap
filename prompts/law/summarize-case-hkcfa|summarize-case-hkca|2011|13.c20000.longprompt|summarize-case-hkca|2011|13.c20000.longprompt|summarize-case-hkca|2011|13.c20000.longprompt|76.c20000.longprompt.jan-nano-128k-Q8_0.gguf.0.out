Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to summarize the case based on the provided text. First, I need to break down the tasks step by step.

Starting with the first task: summarize the facts. The case is about a will contest. Mrs. Nina Wang died in 2007, and her estate was contested. The Foundation, which was named in her 2002 will, sought probate for that will. The Applicant, Chan Chun Chuen, claimed the 2006 Will was valid, making him the sole beneficiary. The trial judge found the 2006 Will was a forgery, and the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. The Applicant now wants to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal.

Next, the arguments of the two parties. The Applicant argues that the appeal is within the "as of right" ground because the 2006 Will is a claim to property. The Foundation counters that it's not a claim to specific property but just a declaration of validity. The Applicant also argues for the "important question" and "or otherwise" grounds, citing new evidence from Police statements. The Foundation says these are not valid because the findings are already confirmed and the new evidence doesn't contradict the original.

For the legal principles, the main points are about the interpretation of section 22(1) of the Court of Final Appeal Ordinance. The Applicant's argument that a probate claim is a claim to property is challenged by the Foundation. The Court of Appeal's decision in China Field and WLK v TMC is referenced, which narrowed the scope of "as of right" appeals to specific property claims. The Court here rejects the Applicant's argument, emphasizing that the appeal must involve a quantifiable financial impact immediately. The "immediacy requirement" is key here. Also, the Court discusses the practice of not reviewing concurrent findings unless there's a clear error, which the Applicant can't show. The new evidence ground is dismissed because the Police statements don't contradict the original evidence.

Finally, the striking aspects. The case is notable for the Court's rejection of the "as of right" ground in a probate case, which is unusual because probate cases are typically not seen as needing such appeals. The emphasis on the immediacy of financial consequences is a novel point. Also, the detailed analysis of the Police statements and the importance of the "partial will" evidence shows the Court's thoroughness in fact-finding. The case highlights the balance between judicial efficiency and the need for a clear miscarriage of justice to justify higher court intervention.

I need to make sure each section is clear and detailed, especially the legal principles part. The user might be a law student or researcher looking for a comprehensive summary, so they need the ratio decidendi to be thorough. Also, the unusual aspects should be highlighted without being too technical, but still informative.

### 1. **Facts of the Case**  
The case involves a dispute over the validity of two wills executed by Mrs. Nina Wang, who died in 2007. The **Foundation** (first respondent) sought probate of her 2002 will, which names the Foundation as the sole beneficiary. The **Applicant** (Chan Chun Chuen) contested this, asserting that the 2006 will he propounded is valid and entitles him to the entirety of her estate. The 2002 will was not in dispute, but the 2006 will’s authenticity was contested.  

In a 40-day trial, **Lam J** ruled in favor of the Foundation, finding the 2006 will to be a forgery. The Applicant appealed to the **Court of Appeal**, which dismissed the appeal. He then sought leave to appeal to the **Court of Final Appeal** (Hong Kong’s highest court). The Applicant argues that the appeal qualifies for leave under **section 22(1)(a)** of the Court of Final Appeal Ordinance, either because it involves a claim to property of value exceeding $1 million or because it raises a question of great public importance. Alternatively, he seeks discretionary leave under **section 22(1)(b)**, citing the "or otherwise" ground, which allows appeals if the question is of exceptional significance.  

The Applicant also introduces **new evidence** in the form of Police statements from **Winfield Wong**, one of the attesting witnesses to the 2006 will, which he claims contradict his earlier testimony. The Foundation argues that these statements do not undermine the trial judge’s findings and that the appeal lacks a valid basis for intervention.

### 2. **Arguments of the Two Parties**  
**Applicant’s Arguments**:  
- **As of Right Ground**: The Applicant contends that the appeal qualifies under section 22(1)(a) because the 2006 will is a claim to property (the estate of Mrs. Wang) of significant value. He argues that the Court of Appeal’s decision to dismiss the appeal was an exception to the general rule that probate claims are not subject to "as of right" appeals, as the 2006 will’s validity directly impacts the distribution of property. He references **China Field Ltd v Appeal Tribunal (Buildings) (No 1)** and **WLK v TMC (No 1)**, which he claims expand the scope of "as of right" appeals to include indirect claims to property.  
- **Important Question Ground**: The Applicant asserts that the appeal raises a question of **public importance**—whether the Court of Final Appeal should review concurrent findings of fact (i.e., those affirmed by the Court of Appeal) unless there is a clear miscarriage of justice. He argues that the Court’s established practice of deferring to lower courts’ factual determinations is outdated and should be abandoned.  
- **New Evidence Ground**: The Applicant claims that the Police statements from Winfield Wong (a key witness) reveal contradictions in his testimony, undermining the trial judge’s reliance on his evidence. He suggests that these statements could show that the 2006 will was not a partial will but a complete will, thereby creating a risk of a miscarriage of justice.  

**Foundation’s Arguments**:  
- **As of Right Ground**: The Foundation argues that the Applicant’s claim does not meet the threshold for "as of right" appeals. The 2006 will is not a claim to a specific property but a **declaration of its validity**, which does not involve a quantifiable financial benefit or detriment. The Foundation emphasizes that the trial judge’s findings (including the forgery of the 2006 will) are not subject to review unless there is a clear error or violation of legal principles.  
- **Important Question Ground**: The Foundation rejects the Applicant’s claim that the Court of Appeal’s decision is of public importance. It notes that the Court of Appeal’s findings are consistent with the trial judge’s, and that the Applicant’s reliance on Commonwealth precedents (e.g., **Re White (No 2)**) is misplaced because those jurisdictions have long abandoned "as of right" appeals to their final courts.  
- **New Evidence Ground**: The Foundation dismisses the Applicant’s new evidence as inconsequential. It argues that the Police statements do not contradict the trial judge’s findings, as Winfield Wong’s recollection of the 2006 will’s content (e.g., the "partial will" nature) is corroborated by other witnesses (e.g., Ng Shun Mo). The Foundation also points out that the Applicant’s reliance on the Police statements is speculative and does not demonstrate a "clear case of error" in the trial judge’s factual determinations.

### 3. **Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**  
The case hinges on the interpretation of **section 22(1)(a)** of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance, which allows appeals as of right if the matter involves a claim to property or civil rights of value exceeding $1 million or raises a question of great public importance. The Court’s decision in **CHINACHEM CHARITABLE FOUNDATION LTD v. CHAN CHUN CHUEN** establishes a **narrow construction** of the "as of right" ground, emphasizing that:  

1. **Property Claims Must Be Specific and Quantifiable**:  
   The Court rejects the Applicant’s argument that a probate claim (e.g., a declaration of will validity) qualifies as a claim to property under section 22(1)(a). It holds that the "as of right" ground applies only to **claims to particular property or proprietary rights** that are clearly quantifiable. In this case, the Applicant’s claim is for a **declaration of the 2006 will’s validity**, not for a specific property entitlement. While the 2006 will may indirectly relate to property (the estate), the Court finds that the appeal does not meet the "immediacy requirement" of section 22(1)(a), which demands that the Court’s order must immediately confer or deny a quantifiable financial benefit. The Applicant’s appeal would require further adjudication of the will’s construction (e.g., whether it revokes the 2002 will or is a codicil), making the financial impact of the appeal **unquantifiable** at the time of the appeal.  

2. **The "Immediacy Requirement" is Central to the "As of Right" Ground**:  
   The Court clarifies that the "as of right" ground is not satisfied unless the appeal’s outcome has **immediate, quantifiable consequences**. The Applicant’s case involves **nine issues**, including the authenticity of the 2006 will and its construction. The trial judge’s finding that the 2006 will is a forgery does not resolve the construction issue, which remains unresolved. Therefore, the Court’s decision to dismiss the appeal under the "as of right" ground is based on the **failure to meet the immediacy requirement**.  

3. **The "Important Question" Ground is Not Satisfied**:  
   The Court rejects the Applicant’s argument that the appeal raises a question of **great public importance**. It notes that the practice of not reviewing concurrent findings of fact (i.e., those affirmed by the Court of Appeal) is **well-established** in Hong Kong and other Commonwealth jurisdictions. The Applicant’s reliance on **Australian and New Zealand precedents** (e.g., **Beard v Perpetual Trustee Co**, **Re White (No 2)**) is deemed **unconvincing** because those jurisdictions have long abandoned "as of right" appeals to their final courts. The Court also emphasizes that the **public interest** in judicial efficiency and avoiding unnecessary delays outweighs the Applicant’s claim that the Court’s practice is outdated.  

4. **The "Or Otherwise" Ground is Not Satisfactory**:  
   The Applicant argues that the Court of Appeal’s findings are inadequate and that the Police statements from Winfield Wong (a key witness) undermine the trial judge’s reliance on his evidence. However, the Court finds that these statements do **not contradict the trial judge’s factual determinations**. Winfield Wong’s recollection of the 2006 will’s content (e.g., that it was a "partial will") is **corroborated by Ng Shun Mo**, the other attesting witness. The Applicant’s claim that the Police statements reveal a "discrepancy" in the beneficiaries’ identities is **inconsequential**, as the beneficiaries’ names were not known to either witness at the time of the trial. The Court also rejects the Applicant’s argument that the Police statements show a "miscarriage of justice," noting that the trial judge’s findings are **not clearly erroneous** and that the Applicant’s reliance on the statements is speculative.  

5. **The Role of the Court of Final Appeal as a "Court of Last Resort"**:  
   The Court underscores its role as a **final appellate court** focused on **points of law of general public importance**, not factual disputes. It rejects the Applicant’s suggestion that the Court should intervene in factual findings unless there is a **clear case of error** or a violation of legal principles. The Court also emphasizes that the **practice of deferring to lower courts’ factual determinations** is **not arbitrary** but rooted in the need to avoid prolonging litigation and to preserve the Court’s focus on legal questions.  

6. **Controversial Interpretation of "Claim to
