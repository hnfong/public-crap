Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a summary of each section in this big bill, starting with Sec. 70401. They specified to be concise, up to four sentences per section, and mention specific parties, entities, and quantities. 

First, I need to go through each section provided in the bill text. The user provided a lot of sections, so I'll start with the first few to see the pattern. Let me look at Sec. 70401 first. The title is "Enhancement of Employer-Provided Child Care Credit." 

Looking at the amendments, they increased the percentage of qualified expenses from 25% to 40% for regular businesses and 50% for eligible small businesses. The maximum credit also went up to $500k and $600k, with inflation adjustments. They also added provisions for third-party intermediaries and jointly owned facilities. The effective date is after 2025.

So, the summary needs to capture the percentage increases, the credit amounts, the entities affected (employers, small businesses), and the effective date. Keep it under four sentences. 

Next, Sec. 70402: "Enhancement of Adoption Credit." The changes include making part of the credit refundable up to $5k, adjusting inflation indices, and excluding the refundable part from carryforwards. Effective 2025. 

I need to mention the refundable portion, the $5k limit, the inflation adjustments, and the effective date. 

Continuing this way for each section. I'll have to parse each section's amendments, note the key changes, the parties involved, numbers, and effective dates. 

Wait, the user wants each section's summary in a separate paragraph, each starting with the section number. They also want specifics like parties (like "employers", "small businesses", "Indian tribal governments"), entities (like "IRS", "qualified scholarship organizations"), and quantities (like "$500k", "40%"). 

I need to ensure that each summary is clear and hits all those points without being too wordy. Let me check a few more sections to confirm the pattern. 

Sec. 70403: Recognizes Indian tribal governments in determining special needs for adoption credit. So, the parties here are Indian tribal governments, and the change is adding them to the list of authorities that can determine special needs. Effective 2025. 

Sec. 70404: Enhances Dependent Care Assistance Program, increasing the limit from $5k to $7.5k. Effective 2026. 

Each of these can be summarized in one sentence or a short paragraph. 

I should proceed section by section, extract the key points, and format them as per the user's instructions. Make sure not to miss any sections and to keep the language concise. Also, check for any specific terms or entities mentioned in each section to include them accurately. 

Alright, let's start drafting each section's summary one by one, ensuring compliance with the user's requirements.
