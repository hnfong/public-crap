Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a summary of each section in this big bill, starting with Sec. 80001. They specified to be concise, up to four sentences per section, and include specific details like parties and quantities. 

First, I need to parse the provided bill text. The sections are under Title VIII, divided into subtitles. Each section (like 80001, 81001, etc.) has amendments to the Higher Education Act. 

Starting with Sec. 80001: It's about exempting certain assets. The amendments add exemptions for family farms, small businesses (up to 100 employees), and commercial fishing businesses. The effective date is July 1, 2026. Got it.

Next, Sec. 81001 deals with loan limits for grad students and parent borrowers. It terminates Grad PLUS loans after July 2026. The annual limits are $20,500 for grad students and $50k for professionals. Aggregate limits are up to $200k depending on their status. Parent loans have $20k annual and $65k aggregate. Also mentions a lifetime max of $257.5k. Need to note the dates and specific numbers here.

Moving to Sec. 82001 on loan repayment. It transitions borrowers from income-contingent to income-based plans by 2028. The Repayment Assistance Plan is introduced with payment caps based on income. Forgiveness after 360 payments. Also mentions different repayment options and consolidation loans. The effective date is 2028.

Sec. 82002 covers deferment and forbearance. Unemployment and economic hardship deferments end for loans after July 2027. Forbearance is limited to 9 months every 24 months. 

Sec. 82003 is about loan rehabilitation, allowing two rehab attempts instead of one. Minimum payments of $10 for certain loans starting 2027.

Sec. 82004 adds Repayment Assistance Plan payments to Public Service Loan Forgiveness eligibility.

Sec. 82005 increases student loan servicing funds to $1 billion.

Subtitle D's sections (83001-83004) handle Pell Grants. Sec. 83001 adjusts eligibility by including foreign income for dependent students. The sunset is 2026. 

Sec. 83002 introduces Workforce Pell Grants for short-term job training programs, with eligibility criteria and state approval. 

Sec. 83003 increases Pell shortfall funding to $12.67 billion. 

Sec. 83004 excludes students receiving non-Federal grants equal to or exceeding their cost of attendance from Pell Grants starting 2026.

Subtitle E's Sec. 84001 makes programs ineligible if their graduates' earnings are below state averages for two of three years. Appeals process and notifications are included.

Subtitle F's sections 85001 and 85002 delay borrower defense and closed school discharge rules until 2035, reinstating older regulations.

Subtitle G's Sec. 86001 allocates $40 million for the National Garden of Heroes statues.

Finally, Sec. 87001 provides $300 million for vetting sponsors of unaccompanied alien children, including background checks and home studies.

I need to ensure each section is summarized in one paragraph, under four sentences, with specifics. Avoid vagueness, mention exact figures, entities like the Secretary of Education, and effective dates where applicable. Also, check that all significant details from each section are included without being too verbose. Let me structure each section's summary accordingly.
