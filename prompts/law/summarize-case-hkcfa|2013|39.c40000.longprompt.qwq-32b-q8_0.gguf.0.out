Okay, let's tackle this case summary. First, I need to understand the facts. The case is W v. The Registrar of Marriages in Hong Kong. The appellant, W, is a post-operative male-to-female transsexual who wants to marry a man. The Registrar denied her application because under Hong Kong's Marriage Ordinance, marriage is between a man and a woman, and W was still legally recognized as male despite her surgery. 

Next, the arguments. The appellant's case is that she should be recognized as a woman for marriage purposes, citing constitutional rights under the Basic Law and Bill of Rights. The Registrar argued that the law requires biological sex at birth, following the Corbett v Corbett case from the UK, which held that transsexuals couldn't marry in their acquired gender.

For the legal principles, the court had to interpret the Marriage Ordinance and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance. They looked at the Corbett criteria, which relied on biological factors fixed at birth. However, the court considered changes in medical understanding and societal attitudes. They referenced the European Court of Human Rights' decision in Goodwin v UK, which found that excluding transsexuals from marrying in their acquired gender violated their rights. The Hong Kong court concluded that the statutory provisions were unconstitutional because they denied W the essence of her right to marry. They allowed a remedial interpretation to include post-operative transsexuals as their acquired gender.

The striking aspect is the court's decision to override the biological birth sex requirement, aligning with international trends. It's notable because it's a progressive step in recognizing trans rights, especially in a region where such rights might be less established. Also, the court's reliance on evolving social norms and medical advancements shows a dynamic approach to constitutional interpretation.

### 1. Summary of the Facts ###  
The case involves W, a post-operative male-to-female transsexual in Hong Kong, who sought to marry her male partner. W underwent sex reassignment surgery (SRS) in Thailand and received medical certification from Hong Kong’s Hospital Authority confirming her gender as female. She was issued a new identity card and passport reflecting her female gender. However, the Registrar of Marriages refused to recognize her as a “woman” under the Marriage Ordinance (Cap. 181) and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance (Cap. 179), which define marriage as between a man and a woman based on biological sex at birth. The Registrar’s decision was upheld at first instance and in the Court of Appeal, prompting W to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal.
