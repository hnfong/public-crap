**Facts of the Case**

The case involves a post-operative male-to-female transsexual person, W, who wishes to marry her male partner. However, the Registrar of Marriages has refused to register their marriage, citing the Marriage Ordinance and the Matrimonial Causes Ordinance, which state that a marriage can only be between a man and a woman. W argues that she should be considered a woman for the purposes of marriage, despite being biologically male, as she has undergone sex reassignment surgery and lives as a woman.

W was diagnosed with gender identity disorder and underwent psychiatric assessment and hormonal treatment between 2005 and 2008. She had an orchidectomy performed in Thailand in 2007 and changed her name to a more feminine one by deed poll in that year. Her "real life experience" under professional supervision was deemed successful, and she successfully underwent sex reassignment surgery at hospitals managed by the Hospital Authority in 2008. After the surgery, she was issued with a Hospital Authority letter certifying that her gender had been changed, enabling her to be issued with a new identity card and passport reflecting her new gender.

**Arguments of the Two Parties**

**Appellant's Argument**

The appellant, W, argues that she should be considered a woman for the purposes of marriage, despite being biologically male. She points out that she has undergone sex reassignment surgery and lives as a woman, and that she has been recognized as a woman by the Hospital Authority and the Government of Hong Kong. She argues that the Marriage Ordinance and the Matrimonial Causes Ordinance should be interpreted to include post-operative male-to-female transsexual persons as women for the purposes of marriage.

W also argues that the concept of marriage has evolved over time and that the traditional understanding of marriage as a union between a man and a woman is no longer relevant in modern society. She points out that many countries, including Canada, India, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Australia, and New Zealand, recognize same-sex marriage, and that the Hong Kong government has already recognized transsexual persons for the purposes of identity cards and passports.

**Respondent's Argument**

The respondent, the Registrar of Marriages, argues that the Marriage Ordinance and the Matrimonial Causes Ordinance should be interpreted to exclude post-operative male-to-female transsexual persons from marriage. She points out that the traditional understanding of marriage as a union between a man and a woman is still widely accepted in Hong Kong, and that the law should not be changed to accommodate a minority group.

The Registrar also argues that the concept of marriage is not just about procreation, but also about the social and cultural norms surrounding marriage. She points out that the institution of marriage has evolved over time, but that the traditional understanding of marriage as a union between a man and a woman remains the dominant understanding in Hong Kong.

**Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The case turns on the interpretation of the Marriage Ordinance and the Matrimonial Causes Ordinance, as well as the constitutional provisions of the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights. The Court must consider whether the statutory provisions are compatible with the constitutional right to marry, and whether the Registrar's interpretation of the law is consistent with the principles of equality and non-discrimination.

The Court's decision will have significant implications for the rights of transsexual persons in Hong Kong, and may set a precedent for future cases involving similar issues. The Court must carefully consider the arguments of both parties and weigh the competing interests and values at stake.

The Court's decision will also raise questions about the nature of marriage and the concept of gender identity. The Court must consider whether the traditional understanding of marriage as a union between a man and a woman is still relevant in modern society, and whether the law should be changed to accommodate the evolving understanding of gender identity.

The Court's decision will also have implications for the rights of transsexual persons to marry and to have their gender recognized. The Court must consider whether the law should be changed to include post-operative male-to-female transsexual persons as women for the purposes of marriage, and whether the Registrar's interpretation of the law is consistent with the principles of equality and non-discrimination.

The Court's decision will also raise questions about the role of the judiciary in interpreting the law and making decisions on matters of social and cultural significance. The Court must carefully consider the arguments of both parties and weigh the competing interests and values at stake, and ensure that its decision is consistent with the principles of the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights.

In conclusion, the case of W v. The Registrar of Marriages is a complex and nuanced one that raises important questions about the nature of marriage, the concept of gender identity, and the rights of transsexual persons. The Court's decision will have significant implications for the rights of transsexual persons in Hong Kong and may set a precedent for future cases involving similar issues. [end of text]
