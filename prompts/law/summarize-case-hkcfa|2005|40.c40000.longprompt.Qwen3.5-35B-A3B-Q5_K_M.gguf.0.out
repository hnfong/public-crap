### 1. Summary of Facts

The case concerns a public procession held on February 10, 2002, in Hong Kong. The 1st appellant, a well-known activist, organized a group of approximately 40 people (later swelling to 96) to protest the conviction of another activist for assault and obstruction of a police officer. The procession began at Chater Garden and proceeded along Queensway to Police Headquarters at Arsenal Street.

Despite police officers being present and advising the organizer to comply with the statutory notification procedure under the Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245), the 1st appellant refused. The procession ignored police advice to use the pedestrian pavement, instead occupying the left traffic lane of the road. Upon arrival at Police Headquarters, they ignored advice to avoid the North Gate due to space constraints and proceeded to that area, where speeches were made. The entire event was peaceful.

Because the organizers failed to notify the Commissioner of Police of their intention to hold the procession as required by the Ordinance, the procession was deemed an "unauthorized assembly." The 1st appellant was convicted of holding an unauthorized assembly, and the 2nd and 3rd appellants were convicted of assisting in holding such an assembly. They were bound over for three months. The appellants appealed, challenging the constitutionality of the statutory scheme regulating public processions, specifically the discretion granted to the Commissioner of Police to restrict assemblies for the purpose of "public order (ordre public)."

### 2. Summary of Arguments

**The Appellants (The Activists):**
The appellants argued that the statutory scheme for regulating public processions was unconstitutional. Their primary contention was that the discretion conferred on the Commissioner of Police to object to or impose conditions on a procession for the purpose of "public order (ordre public)" was too wide, vague, and uncertain. They argued that this lack of precision failed to satisfy the constitutional requirement that restrictions on fundamental rights must be "prescribed by law" with sufficient certainty to allow citizens to regulate their conduct. They further argued that the scheme constituted an impermissible prior restraint on the fundamental right of peaceful assembly, which is closely linked to freedom of speech. They contended that the concept of *ordre public* was so imprecise that it allowed for arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement, thereby chilling the exercise of constitutional rights.

**The Government (The Respondent):**
The Government argued that the notification requirement itself was constitutional and necessary to enable the police to fulfill their positive duty to ensure public safety and minimize disruption to traffic and other members of the public. Regarding the Commissioner's discretion, the Government submitted that the concept of "public order (ordre public)" was a well-established constitutional norm that had been interpreted by courts in various jurisdictions. They argued that the statutory scheme provided adequate safeguards, including the requirement for the Commissioner to give reasons for any objection or condition, the availability of an appeal to an independent Appeal Board, and the possibility of judicial review. The Government suggested that the law should be read down to mean "serious disruption to the life of the community" or limited to the specific prohibitions in Article 20 of the ICCPR (propaganda for war and incitement to hatred), though the Court ultimately rejected these specific readings.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**The Fundamental Nature of Peaceful Assembly and the Positive Duty of the State**
The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) affirmed that the freedom of peaceful assembly is a fundamental right, closely associated with freedom of speech, and lies at the foundation of a democratic society. It emphasized that a democratic society requires a "marketplace of ideas" where minority views, even if disagreeable or offensive, can be ventilated. Crucially, the Court established that the right of peaceful assembly involves a **positive duty** on the part of the Government (the executive) to take reasonable and appropriate measures to enable lawful assemblies to take place peacefully. This duty is not absolute, as the Government cannot guarantee a peaceful outcome, but it requires the state to facilitate the exercise of the right, not merely refrain from interfering.

**The Constitutional Requirements for Restricting Fundamental Rights**
The Court outlined a rigorous two-stage test for any restriction on fundamental rights under the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (BORO), which incorporates the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR):
1.  **The "Prescribed by Law" Requirement:** Any restriction must be prescribed by law. This mandates the principle of **legal certainty**. The law must be adequately accessible and formulated with sufficient precision to enable citizens to foresee the consequences of their actions. A law conferring discretionary powers on public officials that may interfere with fundamental rights must give an adequate indication of the scope of that discretion.
2.  **The "Necessity" Requirement:** Any restriction must be "necessary in a democratic society" for specific legitimate purposes (national security, public safety, public order, protection of health/morals, or protection of the rights of others). This requirement involves the application of a **proportionality test**. The restriction must be rationally connected to a legitimate purpose, and the means used must be no more than is necessary to accomplish that purpose.

**The Unconstitutionality of "Public Order (Ordre Public)" as a Statutory Discretion**
The core of the judgment addresses the specific phrase "public order (ordre public)" in the Public Order Ordinance. The Court drew a sharp distinction between the concept of *ordre public* at the **constitutional level** and at the **statutory level**.
*   **Constitutional Level:** The Court accepted that *ordre public* is a valid constitutional norm. It is an abstract concept that includes the maintenance of law and order but extends to the fundamental principles on which a democratic society is based. As a constitutional norm, it is appropriately expressed in abstract terms.
*   **Statutory Level:** The Court held that when this concept is used to confer a **discretionary power** on an executive official (the Commissioner of Police) to restrict a fundamental right, it fails the "prescribed by law" requirement. The concept is too imprecise and elusive to provide the necessary legal certainty for a citizen to regulate their conduct. Unlike a constitutional norm, a statutory discretion must be sufficiently precise to prevent arbitrary exercise by the executive. Therefore, the Commissioner's discretion to restrict assemblies for the purpose of "public order (ordre public)" was declared **unconstitutional**.

**Severance and the Validity of "Public Order" (Law and Order Sense)**
The Court applied the doctrine of severance. It distinguished between "public order (ordre public)" (the broad, vague concept) and "public order" in the narrower sense of "law and order" (the maintenance of public order and prevention of public disorder). The Court found that the narrower concept of "public order" (law and order) is sufficiently certain. Consequently, the Court severed the broad "ordre public" from the statutory provisions, leaving only the narrower "public order" as a valid ground for the Commissioner's discretion.

**The Proportionality Test and the Validity of the Remaining Scheme**
After severance, the Court examined whether the remaining discretion (limited to "public order" in the law and order sense) satisfied the necessity requirement. The Court held that it did. The scheme was limited to processions of more than 30 persons on public highways or in public parks. The Commissioner's discretion was constrained by the proportionality test, the duty to give reasons, the right of appeal to an Appeal Board, and the availability of judicial review. The Court concluded that the scheme, as read down, was a proportionate means of enabling the Government to fulfill its positive duty to ensure public safety and order without unduly infringing on the right of assembly.

**The Outcome on Convictions**
Despite declaring the "public order (ordre public)" discretion unconstitutional, the Court dismissed the appeal and upheld the appellants' convictions. The convictions were based on the failure to comply with the **notification requirement** (holding an unauthorized assembly), not on the Commissioner's discretion to object or impose conditions. The unconstitutionality of the discretion to restrict did not affect the validity of the notification requirement or the criminal offense of holding an assembly without notification.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

**The Dissenting Judgment of Mr. Justice Bokhary**
The most striking aspect of this case is the profound and detailed dissent by Mr. Justice Bokhary PJ. While the majority (Chief Justice Li and three other judges) upheld the convictions and only severed the vague "ordre public" phrase, Justice Bokhary went much further. He argued that the **entire scheme of prior restraint** (the power to ban or object to processions) was unconstitutional because it was insufficiently circumscribed. He believed that the powers of the Commissioner to prohibit meetings or object to processions, backed by criminal sanctions, were too broad and dangerous to fundamental freedoms. He would have struck down the criminal offense section (s.17A) entirely, effectively quashing the appellants' convictions. His judgment serves as a powerful, alternative vision of how Hong Kong's courts might have prioritized the protection of assembly rights over the state's regulatory interests, highlighting a significant judicial divide on the balance between order and liberty.

**The "Positive Duty" Doctrine**
The explicit articulation of a **positive duty** on the state to facilitate peaceful assembly is a notable development. While many jurisdictions focus on the state's negative duty not to interfere, this judgment emphasizes that the state must actively take reasonable measures to enable the right to be exercised. This shifts the paradigm from mere non-interference to active facilitation, acknowledging that without state support (e.g., traffic management, crowd control), the right to assemble in a dense urban environment like Hong Kong might be illusory.

**The Distinction Between Constitutional and Statutory Vagueness**
The Court's nuanced reasoning regarding the concept of *ordre public* is legally sophisticated. It acknowledges that a concept can be valid and necessary at the abstract constitutional level (where flexibility is required) but invalid when used to grant specific discretionary power to an executive official at the statutory level (where certainty is paramount). This distinction provides a framework for future cases where vague constitutional terms are incorporated into specific statutes, balancing the need for flexible legal principles with the rule of law's demand for certainty.

**The Historical Context of the Challenge**
The case was brought deliberately by the appellants to challenge the constitutionality of the law, a tactic often referred to as "test litigation." The 1st appellant, Leung Kwok Hung, is a prominent figure in Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. The fact that the challenge was mounted by individuals who had already been convicted and were willing to face criminal sanctions to test the law underscores the high stakes of the case for civil liberties in Hong Kong. The judgment itself became a landmark in the post-handover era, setting the boundaries for how the police could regulate protests. [end of text]
