Okay, here's a breakdown of the bill, section by section, as you requested. I'll adhere to your length and detail constraints.

**Sec. 100001. Applicability of the immigration laws.**

This section clarifies that the fees outlined in this subtitle (dealing with immigration-related charges) apply to aliens in the circumstances described throughout the subtitle. It also defines terms used within the subtitle according to the definitions found in section 101 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101), and references to the Immigration and Nationality Act are interpreted accordingly. Essentially, it sets the stage for how the fee structure will be applied and interpreted.

The fee amount will be adjusted annually for inflation, and proceeds are split: 50% goes to the Executive Office for Immigration Review and 50% to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, both of which can retain and expend these funds without further appropriation.  Crucially, fees are *not* waivable.
