**Facts of the Case**

The case involves a dispute over the validity of a will, specifically the 2006 Will of Nina Wang, a deceased Hong Kong businesswoman. The Applicant, Chan Chun Chuen, claims that the 2006 Will is valid and entitled him to Nina Wang's entire estate, while the Chinachem Charitable Foundation Limited (the Foundation) claims that the 2006 Will is a forgery and that the 2002 Will is the authentic document. The dispute began after Nina Wang's death in 2007, when the Foundation commenced probate proceedings to have the 2002 Will declared valid. The Applicant then counterclaimed, seeking to have the 2006 Will declared valid. After a 40-day trial, the trial judge, Lam J, found in favor of the Foundation, concluding that the 2006 Will was a forgery. The Court of Appeal upheld this decision, and the Applicant appealed to the Court of Final Appeal.

**Arguments of the Parties**

The Applicant's arguments can be summarized as follows:

* The Applicant argues that the 2006 Will is valid and entitled him to Nina Wang's entire estate.
* The Applicant claims that the trial judge's finding that the 2006 Will is a forgery was incorrect and that the Court of Appeal's decision was also wrong.
* The Applicant argues that the Court of Appeal's approach to concurrent findings of fact was inadequate and that the Court should have reviewed the findings of the trial judge.
* The Applicant also argues that new evidence, including Police statements taken from Winfield Wong, a key witness, undermines the credibility of the trial judge's findings and suggests that a miscarriage of justice occurred.

The Foundation's arguments can be summarized as follows:

* The Foundation argues that the 2006 Will is a forgery and that the 2002 Will is the authentic document.
* The Foundation claims that the trial judge's finding that the 2006 Will is a forgery was correct and that the Court of Appeal's decision was also correct.
* The Foundation argues that the Court of Appeal's approach to concurrent findings of fact was appropriate and that the Court did not err in upholding the trial judge's findings.
* The Foundation also argues that the Applicant's arguments are without merit and that the Court should not grant leave to appeal.

**Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The Court of Final Appeal's decision in this case establishes several important legal principles, including:

* The Court's approach to concurrent findings of fact: The Court reaffirms its long-standing practice of not reviewing concurrent findings of fact made by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal, unless there is a miscarriage of justice or a critical violation of some principle of law or procedure.
* The requirement for immediacy: The Court emphasizes the importance of the immediacy requirement, which requires that the order sought in the proposed appeal must have the immediate effect of conferring or imposing a financial benefit or detriment on the relevant parties.
* The definition of "directly or indirectly": The Court clarifies that the words "directly or indirectly" describe the nature of a claim asserted and do not affect the requirement for immediacy of the economic consequences of the Court's order.
* The scope of section 22(1)(a): The Court provides guidance on the scope of section 22(1)(a), which allows for appeals as of right in certain circumstances. The Court emphasizes that the second limb of section 22(1)(a) should be narrowly construed and that the first limb only applies to liquidated claims exceeding the threshold amount.
* The importance of the Court's role as a court of final resort: The Court reiterates its role as a court of final resort and emphasizes the importance of not interfering with findings of fact made by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal, unless there is a miscarriage of justice or a critical violation of some principle of law or procedure.

The Court's decision also highlights the importance of the social and historical context of the Court, its intended role, its resources, the interests of litigants, and the proper administration of justice. The Court emphasizes that the decisions of overseas courts on similar matters are not necessarily of assistance, and that the Court's practice, including its approach to concurrent findings of fact, must be for the Court itself to decide, taking account of its social and historical context, its intended role, its resources, the interests of litigants, and the proper administration of justice.
