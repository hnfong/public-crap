Okay, I need to summarize each section of this bill, starting with Sec. 100001. The user wants a concise, specific summary for each section, with at most one paragraph and four sentences. They mentioned being specific about parties, entities, and quantities, so I have to make sure I include those details.

First, let me look at the bill structure. The bill is divided into TITLE X, which includes several parts: COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, with Subtitle A (Immigration and Law Enforcement Matters) and Subtitle B (Judiciary Matters), and Subtitle C (Radiation Exposure Compensation Matters). Each part has multiple sections, like Sec. 100001 to 100018 for Subtitle A, then other sections for the other parts.

Starting with Sec. 100001: "Applicability of the immigration laws." The summary should mention that this section applies fees to aliens in certain circumstances. The parties involved are the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General. The entities are the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The quantities are the fees specified in the following sections, like $100 for asylum, $550 for employment authorization, etc. Wait, but Sec. 100001 itself doesn't specify the fees, just that the fees under this subtitle apply to aliens in the described circumstances. So the summary should note that this section establishes the applicability of fees to aliens under the subtitle, and that the terms are defined in the INA. The key is that it's the foundation for the other sections, so the summary should mention that the fees apply to aliens in the situations outlined in the subtitle, and that the terms are based on the INA.

Next, Sec. 100002: "Asylum Fee." The summary needs to state that the fee is $100 initially, adjusted for inflation, and that 50% goes to the Executive Office for Immigration Review, 50% to USCIS, and any remaining goes to the general fund. The parties are the Secretary and Attorney General, and the entities are the Executive Office for Immigration Review and USCIS. The quantities are the $100 fee, and the percentages for distribution.

Sec. 100003: "Employment Authorization Document Fees." Here, the fee is $550, with 25% going to USCIS and 75% to the general fund. The exceptions are for parolees and TPS holders, but the summary should focus on the main points. The parties are the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the entities are USCIS and the Treasury. The quantities are $550, 25% to USCIS, 75% to general fund.

Sec. 100004: "Immigration Parole Fee." The fee is $1,000, but exceptions apply. The parties are the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the entities are the Treasury. The quantities are $1,000, with exceptions for medical emergencies, family members, etc.

Sec. 100005: "Special Immigrant Juvenile Fee." The fee is $250, and all funds go to the Treasury. The parties are the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the entities are the Treasury. The quantity is $250.

Sec. 100006: "Temporary Protected Status Fee." The fee is $500, with 50% going to the Treasury. The parties are the Attorney General, and the entities are the Treasury. The quantity is $500.

Wait, but the user wants each section's summary to be specific. Let me check the exact wording again. For Sec. 100006, the fee is $500, and the disposition is that all fees go to the general fund. Wait, no, the original text says that the fee is $500, and the disposition is that all fees collected are deposited into the general fund. So the summary should mention that the fee is $500, and all funds go to the Treasury.

Sec. 100007: "Visa Integrity Fee." The fee is $250, with 25% going to the Treasury. The parties are the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the entities are the Treasury. The quantity is $250.

Sec. 100008: "Form I-94 Fee." The fee is $24, with 20% going to the Land Border Inspection Fee Account and 80% to the general fund. The parties are the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the entities are the Treasury and the Land Border Inspection Fee Account.

Sec. 100009: "Annual Asylum Fee." The fee is $100, with all funds going to the Treasury. The parties are the Secretary and Attorney General, and the entities are the Treasury.

Sec. 100010: "Fee relating to renewal and extension of employment authorization for parolees." The fee is $275, with 25% to USCIS and 75% to the general fund. The parties are the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the entities are USCIS and the Treasury.

Sec. 100011: "Fee relating to renewal or extension of employment authorization for asylum applicants." The fee is $275, with 25% to USCIS and 75% to the general fund. The parties are the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the entities are USCIS and the Treasury.

Sec. 100012: "Fee relating to renewal and extension of employment authorization for temporary protected status applicants." The fee is $275, with 25% to USCIS and 75% to the general fund. The parties are the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the entities are USCIS and the Treasury.

Sec. 100013: "Fees relating to applications for adjustment of status." This section has multiple subsections, each with different fees. The main points are that the fee is $1,500 for adjusting status to a lawful permanent resident, $1,050 for waivers, $500 for TPS, $900 for appeals, etc. The parties are the Attorney General, and the entities are the Executive Office for Immigration Review and the Treasury. The quantities are the various fees mentioned.

Sec. 100014: "Electronic System for Travel Authorization fee." The fee is $13 per travel authorization, with adjustments for inflation. The parties are the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the entities are the Treasury and the CBP Electronic Visa Update System Account.

Sec. 100015: "Electronic Visa Update System Fee." The fee is $30 initially, adjusted for inflation. The parties are the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the entities are the Treasury and the CBP Electronic Visa Update System Account. The quantity is $30.

Sec. 100017: "Inadmissible alien apprehension fee." The fee is $5,000 initially, adjusted for inflation. The parties are the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the entities are ICE and the Treasury. The quantity is $5,000.

Sec. 100018: "Amendment to authority to apply for asylum." This changes the wording to require the fee, not allowing it to be waived. The parties are the Attorney General, and the entities are the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The quantity is the fee amount, but the exact number isn't specified here, just that the fee is required.

Then, moving to Part II: Appropriation for the Department of Homeland Security, which is $2,055,000,000 for 2025-2029. The summary should mention the specific amounts and the purposes, like hiring agents, transportation costs, etc.

Similarly, for the other sections in Part II, like U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) getting $29,850,000,000, and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers getting $750,000,000, and the Department of Justice getting $3,330,000,000.

Then, the Judiciary Matters sections: Appropriation to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts is $1,250,000 for 2025-2028, and the Federal Judicial Center gets $1,000,000 for the same years.

Radiation Exposure Compensation Matters: Sec. 100201 extends the fund until 2028, Sec. 100202 adds specific dates for leukemia claims, Sec. 100203 modifies uranium mining claims to include more diseases, Sec. 100204 adds claims for Manhattan Project waste, and Sec. 100205 changes the limitation date to 2027.

I need to make sure each summary is concise, specific, and includes the parties, entities, and quantities. Also, check that each section is covered in one paragraph, up to four sentences. Avoid vague terms, focus on the exact entities and amounts mentioned in the bill.
