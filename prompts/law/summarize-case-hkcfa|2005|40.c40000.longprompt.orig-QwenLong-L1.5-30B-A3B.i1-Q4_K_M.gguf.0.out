Okay, let's tackle this case summary. The user provided a detailed judgment from the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal in the case of Leung Kwok Hung and Others v. HKSAR. The task is to break it down into four parts: facts, arguments, legal principles (ratio decidendi), and any striking aspects.

First, I need to summarize the facts briefly. The case involves a public procession that the appellants organized without notifying the police, leading to their conviction under the Public Order Ordinance. The key points are the procession from Chater Garden to Police Headquarters, the refusal to comply with notification requirements, and the subsequent conviction. The appeal challenged the constitutionality of the Ordinance's provisions regarding public processions.

Next, the arguments of the two parties. The appellants argued that the Commissioner's discretion to restrict assemblies for "public order (ordre public)" was too vague and uncertain, violating the constitutional requirements. The government (respondent) defended the Ordinance, saying it was necessary for public order and that the discretion was properly constrained. The government also mentioned the positive duty of the government to facilitate peaceful assemblies.

Now, the legal principles. This is the meaty part. The court had to determine if the Ordinance's provisions met the constitutional requirements of "prescribed by law" and "necessity in a democratic society." The key issue was the vagueness of "public order (ordre public)." The court held that while "ordre public" is a constitutional concept, using it in the Ordinance for the Commissioner's discretion was too vague. They severed "public order" (meaning maintenance of public order and prevention of disorder) from "public order (ordre public)" to make the discretion constitutional. The court emphasized the need for legal certainty, especially for restrictions on fundamental rights. They also discussed the proportionality test, requiring that restrictions be rationally connected and no more than necessary.

Wait, the court split into two judgments. Chief Justice Li and the majority upheld the convictions, while Mr. Justice Bokhary dissented. Bokhary argued that the entire prior restraint powers were unconstitutional, but the majority focused on severing the term. I need to make sure to clarify that the majority's ratio decidendi was about severing "public order" from "ordre public," not striking down the whole Ordinance.

For the legal principles, I should detail the constitutional requirements: "prescribed by law" and necessity. The court explained that "prescribed by law" requires sufficient precision, and "ordre public" as used in the Ordinance didn't meet that. The majority's approach to severance is important here. They applied the severance test from Ming Pao Newspapers, holding that the valid part (public order) could stand alone. Also, the court stressed the positive duty of the government to facilitate peaceful assemblies, referencing the European Convention case Plattform 'Ärzte für das Leben'.

Novel or controversial points: The court's interpretation of "ordre public" as too vague in the statutory context, even though it's a constitutional term. The severance approach was key—separating the constitutional concept from the statutory application. Also, the emphasis on legal certainty for fundamental rights, which is a recurring theme in human rights jurisprudence. The court's rejection of reading down "ordre public" to "serious disruption" or to Article 20 of the ICCPR is notable.

Striking or unusual aspects: The appellants were activists challenging the law to advance free assembly, which is a common tactic. The case involved a procession protesting another activist's conviction, adding a layer of irony. The court's detailed discussion of the historical context of free assembly, referencing cases from various jurisdictions, shows the depth of the analysis. Also, the split in the judgment—Li CJ upholding the convictions while Bokhary dissenting—highlights the complexity of the issue. The fact that the court focused on severance rather than striking down the entire Ordinance is a significant procedural point.

Wait, the user mentioned the case is from 2005, and the appellants were convicted under the Ordinance. The majority upheld the convictions because the issue was with the "public order (ordre public)" part, not the notification requirement. So the convictions for not notifying the police stood, but the constitutional challenge was about the discretion related to "ordre public." That's important to clarify in the facts and legal principles.

I need to make sure not to confuse the two parts: the notification requirement was upheld as constitutional, but the Commissioner's discretion regarding "ordre public" was struck down (after severance). So the convictions were based on the notification violation, not the discretion, hence the appeal was dismissed.

Also, the court's discussion of the positive duty of the government to facilitate assemblies, citing the government's own report, is a key point. The government acknowledged this duty, which the court used to support the need for reasonable notification requirements.

For the legal principles, the proportionality test is crucial. The court linked the necessity requirement to proportionality, requiring that restrictions be rationally connected and no more than necessary. The majority held that after severance, the discretion for "public order" (the narrower term) satisfied this test.

Wait, the court said that "public order (ordre public)" was unconstitutional, but "public order" (without the "ordre public") was valid. So they severed the two, leaving "public order" as the valid term. The court had to determine that "public order" (law and order sense) is sufficiently certain, which it is, unlike the broader "ordre public."

I should check if the court's reasoning on severance is correctly explained. The majority applied the severance test from Ming Pao, concluding that the legislature would have enacted the statute with just "public order" if they knew the rest was invalid. So the valid part remains.

Another point: the court rejected the government's suggestion to read down "ordre public" to "serious disruption" or to Article 20 of the ICCPR. The reasoning was that those readings weren't supported by the text, and the constitutional norm of "ordre public" is broader, but the statutory use needed to be precise.

The dissenting judgment by Bokhary was more radical, striking down all prior restraint powers, but the majority didn't go that far. The user's task asks for the ratio decidendi, which is the majority's view, so I should focus on that.

For the striking aspects, the case is notable for its detailed analysis of legal certainty in the context of fundamental rights, the use of severance to save part of the law, and the historical references to free assembly. Also, the appellants were known activists, which might have made the case more high-profile.

Wait, the user mentioned "anything striking, unusual or remarkable." The fact that the appellants deliberately brought the case to challenge the law, as noted in Mr. Justice Bokhary's judgment, is a key point. They were using the case to advance the cause of free assembly, which is a strategic move. Also, the court's emphasis on the positive duty of the government to facilitate assemblies, which is a bit different from the usual focus on restrictions.

Another point: the court referenced the European Convention and other jurisdictions extensively, showing a comparative approach. The use of the "thali domide" case (Sunday Times) to explain legal certainty is a good example.

I need to make sure the summary of legal principles covers the constitutional requirements, the analysis of "prescribed by law," the severance, and the proportionality test. Also, clarify that the necessity requirement was satisfied after severance.

Wait, the court said that after severance, the discretion for "public order" satisfies the necessity requirement because it's limited to processions over 30 people on public roads, and the Commissioner must apply the proportionality test. So the valid part is constrained, which meets the constitutional standards.

The user asked for the ratio decidendi to be detailed and thorough. So I need to explain the two constitutional requirements, how the court applied them, the analysis of "ordre public," the severance, and the conclusion that the discretion for "public order" is valid.

Also, the court's rejection of the government's arguments about the necessity of the broad "ordre public" term. The government argued that it's necessary for public order, but the court said the term itself is too vague, so it fails the "prescribed by law" requirement.

Wait, the constitutional requirement is "prescribed by law," which requires the law to be precise enough for citizens to understand. The court held that "ordre public" as used in the Ordinance doesn't meet that because it's too broad and vague. So the discretion is unconstitutional, but by severing it to "public order," which is a narrower term, the discretion becomes constitutional.

I should also mention the distinction between the constitutional concept of "ordre public" and its statutory application. The constitutional term is abstract, but the statutory use needs to be precise. The court made that distinction clear.

For the arguments, the appellants' main point was the vagueness of "ordre public," while the government argued that the discretion was properly constrained and necessary. The government also cited the positive duty of the government to facilitate assemblies, which the court acknowledged but didn't rely on for the constitutional challenge.

Wait, the government's argument included that the notification requirement is necessary for the positive duty, which the court agreed with. But the challenge was about the "ordre public" part, not the notification. So the government's defense of the notification requirement was separate from the constitutional challenge.

In the legal principles, the court's discussion of the positive duty is important because it's a counterbalance to the restrictions. The government must take reasonable measures to enable peaceful assemblies, which is why notification is allowed. But the Commissioner's discretion to restrict based on "ordre public" was the problem.

I need to structure the legal principles section to first explain the constitutional requirements, then the analysis of "ordre public" as a statutory term, the severance, and the proportionality test. Highlight the novelty in the court's approach to severance and the emphasis on legal certainty for fundamental rights.

Also, the court's reference to the European Court of Human Rights cases, like Malone v. UK, which dealt with legal certainty in the context of privacy. That's a key precedent they cited.

Wait, the user mentioned "points that might be novel or controversial." The court's decision to sever "public order" from "ordre public" is a novel approach in this context.
