**Summary of Facts**

The case involves the appeal of Donald Tsang, the former Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, against his conviction for bribery and misconduct in public office. The charges arose from his dealings with Wong Cho-bau, a mainland businessman, in connection with the refurbishment and re-decoration of a residential property in Shenzhen, which Tsang proposed to occupy after his retirement. The property was owned by a company controlled by Wong. The prosecution alleged that the arrangements concerning the property were a bribe, an inducement or reward for Tsang's handling of broadcasting license applications made by Wave Media Limited (WML), a company in which Wong held shares. The jury could not agree on the bribery charge, but Tsang was convicted of misconduct in public office for failing to disclose his dealings and negotiations with Wong to the Executive Council (ExCo) when they were considering the applications.

**Summary of Arguments**

The prosecution argued that Tsang's failure to disclose his dealings with Wong was a deliberate and dishonest concealment, and that he was "hopelessly compromised" by his relationship with Wong. The prosecution's primary case was that the dealings between Tsang and Wong were corrupt, and that Tsang had taken a bribe. However, the jury did not accept this case, and the prosecution's alternative case on Count 2, which alleged that Tsang's failure to disclose was a serious abuse of office, was not clearly explained. The defense argued that the dealings with Wong were arm's-length and commercial, and that Tsang did not have an obligation to disclose his negotiations with Wong to the ExCo. The defense also argued that even if there was an obligation to disclose, Tsang's failure to do so was not wilful misconduct, and was not of a degree of seriousness to attract criminal liability.

**Summary of Legal Principles**

The case raises several novel and controversial legal principles, particularly in relation to the offense of misconduct in public office. The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge's directions on wilfulness and seriousness were inadequate, and that the jury was not properly instructed on how to approach the alternative case on Count 2. The court emphasized that the offense of misconduct in public office requires a high degree of culpability, and that the seriousness of the misconduct must be assessed in the context of the officeholder's responsibilities and the nature and extent of the departure from those responsibilities.

The court also highlighted the importance of distinguishing between deliberate non-disclosure and deliberate concealment. Deliberate non-disclosure may be the result of an error of judgment, whereas deliberate concealment implies dishonesty. The court noted that the prosecution's primary case on Count 2 was based on the assumption that the dealings between Tsang and Wong were corrupt, and that the jury's verdict on Count 2 cannot be confidently interpreted without a clear explanation of the alternative case.

The court also emphasized the need for the trial judge to provide assistance to the jury on how to assess the seriousness of the misconduct, particularly in cases where corruption, dishonesty, or other illegal practices are not involved. The court cited the judgment of Chan ACJ, who stated that in such cases, the consequences of the misconduct may not be obvious, and that the jury needs guidance on how to assess seriousness and harm.

In terms of the elements of the offense of misconduct in public office, the court reiterated that the offense requires a public official to wilfully misconduct themselves by act or omission, without reasonable excuse or justification, and that the misconduct must be serious, not trivial. The court also emphasized that the offense does not necessarily involve venality, and that neglect of duty or abuse of power may amount to criminal misconduct even if the accused gains no personal benefit from it.

The court's decision highlights the importance of clear and accurate directions to the jury, particularly in complex cases involving alternative theories of liability. The court's emphasis on the need for the trial judge to provide assistance to the jury on how to assess the seriousness of the misconduct is also a significant development in the law of misconduct in public office.
