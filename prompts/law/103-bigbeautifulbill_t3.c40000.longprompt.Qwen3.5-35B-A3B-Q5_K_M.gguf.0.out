**Sec. 30001**
This section amends the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to reduce the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection's (CFPB) funding cap from 12 percent to 6.5 percent of the Federal Reserve System's total operating expenses. By striking the number "12" and inserting "6.5," the legislation directly limits the annual budget available to the CFPB for its regulatory and enforcement activities. This change affects the financial resources available to the Bureau to oversee consumer financial laws and protect consumers from unfair practices. The reduction is intended to constrain the agency's operational scale relative to the Federal Reserve's overall budget.

**Sec. 30002**
This provision rescinds all unobligated balances of funds previously made available under the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program for Multifamily Housing established by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The rescission applies specifically to the amounts authorized in Public Law 117-169, effectively canceling any remaining budget authority for this specific housing retrofit initiative. As a result, no further federal funds can be allocated or spent on this program for retrofitting multifamily housing units to improve energy efficiency and resilience. The action ensures that these specific unspent funds are returned to the Treasury rather than being used for the intended green housing projects.

**Sec. 30003**
This section restructures the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Reserve Fund by striking subsection (i) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and redesignating subsequent subsections. It clarifies that the Fund is available without fiscal year limitations specifically for paying whistleblower awards under section 21F(g)(2). A transition provision allows the SEC to continue expending amounts obligated before the enactment date for ongoing programs until October 1, 2025. Effective October 1, 2025, all remaining obligated and unobligated balances in the SEC Reserve Fund are transferred to the general fund of the Treasury, officially closing the account.

**Sec. 30004**
This section appropriates an additional $1,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2025 to carry out the Defense Production Act (DPA). These funds are drawn from amounts not otherwise appropriated and remain available for obligation until September 30, 2027. The appropriation is designed to support the Department of Defense and other federal agencies in utilizing the DPA to accelerate the production of critical defense materials and technologies. This funding ensures continued federal capacity to prioritize and expand domestic manufacturing capabilities for national security needs. [end of text]
