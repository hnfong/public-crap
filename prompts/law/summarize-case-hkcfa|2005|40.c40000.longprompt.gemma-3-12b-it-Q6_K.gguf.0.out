Okay, let's break down the *Leung Kwok Hung & Others v. HKSAR* case.

**1. Summary of Facts**

The case arose from a protest march in Hong Kong on February 10, 2002.  A group of approximately 40-96 people gathered at Chater Garden to protest the conviction of an activist for assault and obstruction of a police officer. The organizers did not obtain prior notification from the police, as required by the Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245).  Police warned the organizers about the consequences of failing to notify. The procession proceeded along Queensway towards Police Headquarters, sometimes using the road instead of the pavement.  The appellants (Leung Kwok Hung, and two others) were convicted of holding and assisting in holding an unauthorized assembly under section 17A(3)(b)(i) of the Ordinance. They appealed, arguing that the statutory scheme regulating public processions was unconstitutional.

**2. Summary of Arguments**

*   **Appellants (Leung Kwok Hung & Others):** Argued that the statutory scheme for regulating public processions, specifically the Commissioner of Police's discretion to restrict assemblies for "public order (ordre public)," was too broad and uncertain to satisfy constitutional requirements. They contended that this discretion violated the principles of legal certainty and proportionality, as enshrined in the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance.
*   **Respondent (HKSAR - Government):** Argued that the statutory scheme was a reasonable and necessary regulation of public processions, balancing the right to freedom of assembly with the need to maintain public order and safety. They asserted that the concept of "public order (ordre public)" was sufficiently defined and that the Commissioner's discretion was exercised reasonably and in accordance with the law. They also emphasized the importance of prior notification to allow police to manage potential disruptions.

**3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The core of this case revolves around the constitutional limits on restricting fundamental rights, specifically the right to freedom of peaceful assembly. Here's a detailed breakdown of the legal principles established:

*   **Fundamental Rights and Generous Interpretation:** The Court reaffirmed that fundamental rights, including freedom of peaceful assembly, must be given a "generous interpretation" to ensure their full measure. Restrictions on these rights must be narrowly interpreted.
*   **Constitutional Framework: Basic Law and ICCPR:** The case heavily relies on Article 27 of the Basic Law (guaranteeing freedom of assembly) and Article 39 of the Basic Law (incorporating the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights â€“ ICCPR) as applied to Hong Kong. Article 17 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (BORO), which mirrors Article 21 of the ICCPR, is also central.
*   **Two Constitutional Requirements for Restriction:** Any restriction on the right to peaceful assembly must satisfy two key requirements:
    *   **"Prescribed by Law" Requirement:** The restriction must be clearly defined and accessible in law, providing sufficient certainty to allow individuals to regulate their conduct. This means the law must not be vague or arbitrary.
    *   **"Necessity Requirement":** The restriction must be "necessary in a democratic society" to achieve a legitimate purpose (national security, public safety, public order, protection of health or morals, or protection of the rights and freedoms of others). This involves a proportionality test.
*   **Proportionality Test:** The Court explicitly adopted a proportionality test to assess the "necessity" requirement. This involves considering:
    *   **Rational Connection:** Whether the restriction is rationally connected to the legitimate purpose.
    *   **Necessity:** Whether the means used to impair the right are no more than necessary to accomplish the legitimate purpose.
*   **"Public Order (Ordre Public)" and Uncertainty:** The Court found that the Commissioner of Police's discretion to restrict assemblies based on "public order (ordre public)" *failed* to satisfy the "prescribed by law" requirement. The Court deemed the concept of "public order (ordre public)" too broad and uncertain when applied to the exercise of discretionary power by the Commissioner. This was a key and controversial finding.
*   **Severance and Reinterpretation:** The Court held that the portion of the Ordinance granting the Commissioner the power to restrict based on "public order (ordre public)" was unconstitutional and should be severed. However, the Court *did* find that the remaining provisions relating to "public order" (in the sense of maintaining law and order) were constitutionally valid, provided they were interpreted in a manner consistent with the principles of legal certainty and proportionality.
*   **Positive Duty of the Government:** The Court emphasized that the government has a positive duty to take reasonable measures to enable lawful assemblies to take place peacefully.
*   **Notification Requirement:** The Court upheld the requirement for prior notification of public processions as constitutionally valid, recognizing its importance for police to manage potential disruptions and ensure public safety.
*   **Judicial Review and Scrutiny:** The Court underscored the importance of judicial review to ensure that restrictions on fundamental rights are proportionate and do not unduly infringe upon those rights.
*   **Unconstitutionality of Section 17A:** The Court ultimately declared Section 17A of the Ordinance, which created criminal offences for holding unauthorized assemblies, to be unconstitutional, as it was inextricably linked to the unconstitutional powers of prior restraint.

**Novel/Controversial Points:**

*   **Severance of "Ordre Public":** The Court's decision to sever the "public order (ordre public)" component of the Commissioner's discretion was a significant and potentially controversial move. It essentially limited the scope of the Commissioner's power, requiring a more precise justification for restricting assemblies.
*   **Unusual Technique of Incorporation:** The Court noted the unusual technique used in the Ordinance of incorporating the ICCPR's language directly into the statute. This created a unique legal landscape that required careful interpretation.
*   **Emphasis on Legal Certainty:** The Court's strong emphasis on legal certainty as a cornerstone of constitutional rights was a notable aspect of the judgment.



**4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects**

*   **The Length and Detail of the Judgment:** The judgment is exceptionally long and detailed, demonstrating the complexity of the constitutional issues involved. The Court meticulously analyzed the relevant provisions, international law, and previous case law.
*   **The Activist Appellant:** The fact that one of the appellants, Leung Kwok Hung, was a well-known activist and deliberately organized the procession to challenge the law adds a layer of political significance to the case.
*   **The Court's Willingness to Strike Down a Portion of the Ordinance:** The Court's decision to strike down a portion of the Public Order Ordinance, a law designed to regulate public gatherings, was a bold move that underscored the importance of protecting fundamental rights.
*   **The Focus on "Ordre Public":** The Court's deep dive into the meaning and application of "ordre public" was particularly striking. It highlighted the challenges of balancing public order with freedom of expression and assembly.
*   **The Dissenting Opinion:** The strong dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Bokhary PJ, which argued that the Court was unduly restricting the Commissioner's powers and undermining the ability to maintain public order, further underscores the controversial nature of the case. [end of text]
