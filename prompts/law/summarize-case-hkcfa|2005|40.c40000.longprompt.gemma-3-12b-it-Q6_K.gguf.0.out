## 1. Summary of Facts

The case of *Leung Kwok Hung and Others v. HKSAR* arose from a protest march in Hong Kong on February 10, 2002. The appellants (Leung Kwok Hung, and two others) organized and participated in a procession protesting the conviction of an activist. They did not notify the police in advance, as required by the Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245), which regulates public processions. The police warned them of the consequences of failing to comply, but the procession proceeded. Approximately 40-96 people participated, and the march deviated from the designated pedestrian pavement and used a traffic lane. The appellants were convicted of holding and assisting in holding an unauthorized assembly under section 17A(3)(b)(i) of the Ordinance and bound over on recognizance. They appealed, challenging the constitutionality of the Ordinance's scheme for regulating public processions, specifically arguing that the Commissioner of Police's discretion to restrict peaceful assembly for "public order (ordre public)" was too broad and uncertain.

## 2. Summary of Arguments

**Appellants' Argument:** The appellants argued that the statutory scheme for regulating public processions, particularly the Commissioner of Police's power to restrict assemblies based on "public order (ordre public)," was unconstitutional. They contended that this power was too wide and uncertain, failing to meet the requirements of "prescribed by law" and "necessary in a democratic society" as mandated by Article 39(2) of the Basic Law and Article 17 of the Bill of Rights Ordinance (BORO). They argued that the concept of "public order (ordre public)" was too vague to provide sufficient guidance to the Commissioner and to allow individuals to regulate their conduct accordingly.

**Respondent's (Government) Argument:** The Government argued that the statutory scheme was constitutional and necessary for maintaining public order and safety. They asserted that the concept of "public order (ordre public)" was sufficiently defined within the context of the ICCPR and that the Commissioner's discretion was reasonable and subject to safeguards, including the possibility of appeal. They also emphasized the importance of prior notification to allow the police to manage public gatherings effectively and prevent disruptions. They further argued that the scheme was a sincere effort to comply with the ICCPR and had been operating effectively since its enactment.



## 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The Court’s ratio decidendi in *Leung Kwok Hung and Others v. HKSAR* is complex and multifaceted, revolving around the constitutional requirements for restricting the right to peaceful assembly. Here's a detailed breakdown:

**I. Fundamental Right and its Limitations:**

*   **Right to Peaceful Assembly:** The Court reaffirmed the fundamental importance of the right to peaceful assembly, closely associated with freedom of speech, association, procession, and demonstration, as enshrined in Article 27 of the Basic Law and Article 17 of the BORO. This right is to be given a generous interpretation.
*   **Restrictions Permissible:** The Court reiterated that this right is not absolute and can be subject to restrictions, but only if two conditions are met: (1) the restriction must be "prescribed by law" (satisfying the "prescribed by law" requirement), and (2) the restriction must be "necessary in a democratic society" in the interests of specific purposes (satisfying the "necessity requirement"). These are the constitutional requirements for restriction.
*   **Incorporation of ICCPR:** The Court emphasized that Article 39(2) of the Basic Law incorporates the ICCPR as applied to Hong Kong, and Article 17 of BORO reflects the ICCPR's provisions regarding restrictions on the right to peaceful assembly.

**II. Analysis of the Statutory Scheme & "Public Order (Ordre Public)":**

*   **"Prescribed by Law" Requirement – The Core Issue:** The central issue was whether the Commissioner of Police’s discretion to restrict assembly for the purpose of "public order (ordre public)" satisfied the "prescribed by law" requirement. The Court found that it did *not*.
*   **Vagueness of "Public Order (Ordre Public)":** The Court acknowledged that "public order (ordre public)" is an inherently imprecise and elusive concept, even when considered at the constitutional level. While it encompasses public order in the traditional sense (law and order), it extends beyond that. However, the Court found that using this vague concept as the basis for a broad discretionary power vested in the executive branch (the Commissioner of Police) failed to provide sufficient legal certainty, violating the "prescribed by law" requirement. The Court distinguished between the abstract nature of the concept at the constitutional level and its application in a statutory scheme granting discretionary power.
*   **Unconstitutionality of the Discretion:** The Court concluded that the Commissioner’s discretion to restrict assembly based on "public order (ordre public)" was unconstitutional because it lacked the necessary precision to allow individuals to regulate their conduct and was susceptible to arbitrary application.
*   **Severance of "Public Order (Ordre Public)":** The Court ordered the severance of "public order (ordre public)" from the relevant sections of the Ordinance (ss. 14(1), 14(5), and 15(2)). This means that the Commissioner can no longer restrict assemblies based solely on this vague concept.
*   **"Public Order" (Narrower Meaning) Remains Valid:** The Court clarified that the concept of "public order" in the narrower sense (maintenance of public order and prevention of public disorder) *did* satisfy the "prescribed by law" requirement and could be used as a basis for restricting assembly.

**III. The "Necessity Requirement" and Proportionality:**

*   **Proportionality Test:** The Court reaffirmed that the "necessity requirement" involves applying a proportionality test. This means that any restriction on the right to peaceful assembly must be rationally connected to a legitimate purpose and no more than is necessary to achieve that purpose.
*   **Positive Duty on the Government:** The Court reiterated that the government has a positive duty to take reasonable measures to enable lawful assemblies to take place peacefully.
*   **Application After Severance:** After severing "public order (ordre public)," the Court found that the remaining statutory scheme, allowing restrictions based on "public order" (in the narrower sense), satisfied the proportionality test. The scheme included safeguards such as notification requirements, appeal mechanisms, and judicial review.

**IV. Other Key Principles:**

*   **Importance of Legal Certainty:** The Court strongly emphasized the importance of legal certainty in restricting fundamental rights and freedoms, drawing on precedents from various jurisdictions. Vague laws are inherently problematic as they can deter the exercise of freedoms and lead to arbitrary enforcement.
*   **Scrutiny of Prior Restraint:** The Court highlighted the need for particularly rigorous scrutiny of powers of prior restraint (powers to prevent an assembly from taking place), as these powers can significantly impact freedom of expression and assembly.
*   **Unconstitutionality of S.17A:** The Court declared section 17A of the Ordinance (which creates criminal offences related to unauthorized assemblies) unconstitutional, as it was inextricably linked to the unconstitutional powers of prior restraint.
*   **Notification Requirement Remains Constitutional:** The Court found that the requirement to notify the police of a public meeting or procession was constitutional, provided it did not preclude spontaneous demonstrations.



**Novel and Controversial Points:**

*   **Severance and Interpretation:** The Court’s decision to sever "public order (ordre public)" and its interpretation of the relationship between the ICCPR and the Ordinance’s provisions were novel. The unusual technique of incorporating the ICCPR into the Ordinance, and then interpreting it in a specific statutory context, was a unique aspect of the case.
*   **Emphasis on Legal Certainty:** The Court’s strong emphasis on legal certainty as a cornerstone of constitutional protection was a significant contribution to Hong Kong’s jurisprudence on fundamental rights.
*   **Balancing Freedom and Order:** The case demonstrates the ongoing tension between protecting fundamental freedoms and maintaining public order, and the Court’s attempt to strike a balance between these competing interests. The decision underscores the need for clear and precise legal frameworks when restricting fundamental rights. [end of text]
