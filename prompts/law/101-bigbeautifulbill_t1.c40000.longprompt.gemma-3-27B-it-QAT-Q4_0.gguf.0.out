Okay, here's a breakdown of the changes in each section of the bill, as requested, starting with Sec. 10101.  I've aimed for conciseness and specificity, keeping within the length constraints.

**Subtitle A - Nutrition**

**SEC. 10101. RE-EVALUATION OF THRIFTY FOOD PLAN.** This section revises how the "Thrifty Food Plan" (used to calculate SNAP benefits) is determined. It standardizes the market baskets used for the plan, limiting changes and basing cost adjustments on the Consumer Price Index (CPI).  A re-evaluation of the market baskets is allowed starting October 1, 2027, but must be cost-neutral, meaning it can't increase overall program costs.  It also sets specific household size adjustments for calculating allotments.

**SEC. 10102. MODIFICATIONS TO SNAP WORK REQUIREMENTS FOR ABLE-BODIED ADULTS.** This section loosens work requirement exceptions for SNAP eligibility, including those under 18 or over 65, those medically unfit, parents with young children, and members of certain Native American tribes. It standardizes enforcement across states, requiring unemployment rates of 1.5x the national average for waivers.  Noncontiguous states (like Alaska and Hawaii) have a separate exemption process, potentially expiring December 31, 2028, if they don't demonstrate good faith compliance.

**SEC. 10103. AVAILABILITY OF STANDARD UTILITY ALLOWANCES BASED ON RECEIPT OF ENERGY ASSISTANCE.** This section expands eligibility for standard utility allowances in SNAP by including households with elderly or disabled members.

**SEC. 10105. MATCHING FUNDS REQUIREMENTS.** This section introduces a tiered state cost-sharing system for SNAP based on payment error rates, beginning in fiscal year 2028. States with error rates below 6% have 100% federal funding, while those above 10% have 85% federal funding.  There are provisions for delayed implementation for states with high error rates in 2025 and 2026, and an option to use prior year error rates for initial calculations.

**SEC. 10106. ADMINISTRATIVE COST SHARING.** This section reduces the federal share of SNAP administrative costs from 50% to 25% beginning in fiscal year 2027.

**SEC. 10107. NATIONAL EDUCATION AND OBESITY PREVENTION GRANT PROGRAM.** This section extends the National Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program through fiscal year 2025, rather than ending in 2016.

**SEC. 10108. ALIEN SNAP ELIGIBILITY.** This section tightens SNAP eligibility requirements for non-citizens, requiring lawful permanent residency or specific qualifying statuses (Cuban/Haitian entrants, Compact of Free Association residents).  Income and resources of ineligible individuals must be considered when determining household eligibility.
