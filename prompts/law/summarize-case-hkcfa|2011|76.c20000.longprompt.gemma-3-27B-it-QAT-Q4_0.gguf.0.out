## Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v Chan Chun Chuen: Case Summary

### 1. Facts of the Case

Following the death of Nina Wang in 2007, a probate dispute arose between the Chinachem Charitable Foundation (the Foundation) and Chan Chun Chuen (the Applicant). The Foundation sought a pronouncement validating a 2002 will naming it as the beneficiary. The Applicant countered, claiming a 2006 will existed naming *him* as the sole beneficiary. The core of the dispute was the authenticity of the 2006 will, which the trial judge found to be a forgery. Both the Court of Appeal and the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) upheld this finding. The Applicant then sought leave to appeal to the CFA, arguing the case involved points of law of public importance and/or that a miscarriage of justice had occurred.  The central issue on appeal was whether the case met the criteria for leave to appeal under the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**The Applicant (Chan Chun Chuen):** Argued that leave to appeal should be granted on multiple grounds:

*   **As of Right:** The case involved a claim to property exceeding $1,000,000 (under the second limb of section 22(1)(a) of the Ordinance). He claimed his claim to the estate, even if indirect, met this threshold.
*   **Discretionary Leave (Public Importance):** The case raised a question of great general or public importance regarding the CFA’s practice on concurrent findings of fact. He argued the practice was unduly restrictive and should be revisited.
*   **Discretionary Leave (“Otherwise” Ground):** The case involved circumstances that warranted the CFA’s intervention.
*   **New Evidence:** Newly discovered police statements from a key attesting witness (Winfield Wong) contradicted his previous testimony, potentially demonstrating a miscarriage of justice.

**The Foundation:** Argued that leave to appeal should be denied:

*   **As of Right:** The claim was not for a direct proprietary interest but merely for a declaration regarding the will’s validity.  The “as of right” limb of the Ordinance applied only to liquidated monetary claims.
*   **Discretionary Leave:** The appeal lacked merit as the trial judge’s findings were concurrent and supported by the Court of Appeal. Overturning those findings would require a review of facts, which the CFA rarely undertakes.
*   **New Evidence:** The new evidence was not sufficiently compelling to warrant overturning the concurrent findings of fact. The discrepancies were minor and did not undermine the core findings.



### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The CFA’s determination centered on the interpretation and application of section 22(1) of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance, which governs leave to appeal. The court meticulously outlined the principles governing appeals to a final appellate court, particularly concerning the “as of right” and discretionary grounds.

**1. Appeals as of Right (Section 22(1)(a)):**

*   **Narrow Construction:** Section 22(1)(a) should be construed narrowly. The first limb applies only to claims for liquidated monetary sums exceeding $1,000,000.
*   **Property Claim Requirement:** The second limb requires a claim to *specific* property or a *proprietary right* of the requisite value. A claim for a declaration regarding a will’s validity, without a direct claim to the estate itself, is insufficient.
*   **Immediacy Requirement:** Even if a claim relates to property, it must have an *immediate* financial consequence of at least $1,000,000 upon the court’s order.  The order must directly confer or impose a financial benefit or detriment of that amount.  Potential future financial consequences are not enough.
*   **Probate Cases:** The special inquisitorial jurisdiction of probate courts (e.g., the ability to compel production of privileged documents) does not qualify a probate case for leave to appeal as of right.

**2. Discretionary Leave (Section 22(1)(b)):**

*   **Oppressive Appeals:** Appeals to a final court are oppressive to successful litigants unless they involve a point of law of public importance or a risk of grievous injustice.
*   **Concurrent Findings of Fact:** The CFA is reluctant to interfere with concurrent findings of fact made by the trial court and the Court of Appeal.  Such interference is reserved for cases of miscarriage of justice or violation of legal principles.
*   **Practice on Concurrent Findings:** The CFA adopted the practice established in *Sky Heart Ltd v Lee Hysan Estate Co Ltd* (1997-1998) 1 HKCFAR 318, which mirrors the principles set out in *Srimati Bibhabati Devi v Kumar Ramendra Narayan Roy* [1946] AC 508 (Privy Council). This practice requires a high threshold for overturning concurrent findings.
*   **Policy Considerations:** The practice is rooted in policy considerations, including the efficient administration of justice, the distribution of function between court levels, and the avoidance of lengthy factual re-hearings.
*   **Public Importance:**  A question must be of *great* general or public importance to warrant discretionary leave.

**3. The “New Evidence” Ground:**

*   **High Threshold:** New evidence must be compelling and demonstrate a real possibility of altering the outcome of the appeal.
*   **Impact on Concurrent Findings:** The new evidence must undermine the basis for the concurrent findings of fact.  Minor inconsistencies or peripheral matters are insufficient.
*   **Ladd v Marshall Requirements:** The evidence must be unavailable at trial with due diligence and be crucial to the case.

**Novel/Controversial Points:**

*   **The Scope of “Property Claim”:** The case clarified the narrow interpretation of “property claim” for the purposes of section 22(1)(a). The court rejected the argument that an indirect claim to an estate was sufficient.
*   **The Rigidity of the Concurrent Findings Practice:** The Applicant’s challenge to the CFA’s practice on concurrent findings raised the question of whether the court should be more willing to review factual findings, particularly in cases involving potential fraud or forgery. The CFA firmly rejected this challenge, emphasizing the importance of finality and the efficient administration of justice.
*   **The Balancing Act:** The case highlighted the inherent tension between the right of appeal and the need to avoid unnecessary litigation. The CFA’s practice reflects a deliberate attempt to strike a balance between these competing interests.



### 4. Striking, Unusual or Remarkable Aspects of the Case

Several aspects of the case are striking:

*   **The Nina Wang Saga:** The case is part of a larger, highly publicized legal battle surrounding the estate of Nina Wang, one of Hong Kong’s wealthiest women. The allegations of forgery and the complex family dynamics added a sensational element to the proceedings.
*   **The Lengthy Litigation:** The dispute spanned several years and involved multiple levels of court, demonstrating the potential for protracted litigation in probate cases.
*   **The Detailed Analysis of Evidence:** The judgments reveal a meticulous examination of the evidence, including witness testimony, handwriting analysis, and police statements.
*   **The CFA’s Firm Stance:** The CFA’s determination reflects a strong commitment to its role as a final appellate court and a reluctance to interfere with the findings of lower courts. The court’s detailed reasoning underscores the high threshold for obtaining leave to appeal.
*   **The Call for Reconsideration of “As of Right” Appeals:** The CFA’s concluding remarks suggest a growing concern about the appropriateness of the “as of right” basis for appeals, given the changes in the legal landscape since the pre-1997 regime. This raises the possibility of future reforms to the appeals process.
*   **The Sujanani Factor:** The role of Mr. Sujanani, the barrister who drafted portions of Winfield Wong’s statement, and the questions surrounding his influence on the witness’s testimony, added a layer of complexity and suspicion to the case. The police statements revealed attempts to shape Wong’s account, though the CFA ultimately found this did not undermine the core findings.
