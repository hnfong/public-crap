Okay, here’s a breakdown of the *Leung Kwok Hung and Others v. HKSAR* case, addressing the three requested sections with a detailed and thorough response:

**1. Summary of the Facts**

The case revolves around a public procession held in February 2002 in Hong Kong protesting against the conviction of an activist for assault and obstruction of a police officer. The procession, comprised of approximately 40-96 people, initially started at Chater Garden and proceeded to Police Headquarters. The organizers, the appellants, failed to notify the Commissioner of Police as required by the Public Order Ordinance.  The police charged them with violating the ordinance by holding an unauthorized assembly. The Court of First Instance convicted them, and the Court of Appeal upheld those convictions. The core legal challenge was whether the ordinance’s provisions allowing the Commissioner of Police to restrict public processions for the purpose of “public order” were constitutional, specifically regarding the breadth of that “public order” concept and the certainty of the law. The case centered on the balance between maintaining public order and protecting the right to peaceful assembly.

**2. Summary of the Arguments**

*   **Appellants’ Arguments (Leung Kwok Hung and Others):** The appellants argued that the ordinance’s definition of “public order” was too broad and vague, giving the Commissioner of Police excessive discretion to suppress peaceful protests. They contended that this lack of clarity violated the constitutional requirement of “prescribed by law” – meaning the law must be sufficiently precise to allow individuals to understand and comply with it. They argued that the broad definition of “public order” could be used to stifle dissent and that the ordinance lacked sufficient safeguards to prevent abuse of power. They also challenged the constitutionality of section 17A, which created criminal offences for failing to notify the police of a procession.

*   **Government’s Arguments (HKSAR):** The government maintained that the ordinance was constitutional and that the Commissioner of Police’s discretion was justified. They argued that “public order” encompassed legitimate concerns about maintaining public safety and preventing disruption, and that the ordinance provided sufficient safeguards to prevent abuse of power. They emphasized the need for a flexible approach to managing public gatherings and pointed to the positive duty on the government to facilitate lawful assemblies. They also argued that the ordinance was necessary to balance the right to peaceful assembly with other important public interests. They defended the section 17A as a necessary deterrent to ensure compliance with notification requirements.



**3. Summary of the Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

This case is a landmark decision concerning the interpretation of fundamental rights and the limits of governmental power in Hong Kong. The Court of Appeal’s ruling established several key legal principles:

*   **The Importance of Fundamental Rights:** The Court emphasized the importance of fundamental rights, particularly the freedom of peaceful assembly, as cornerstones of a democratic society. It stressed the need for a generous interpretation of these rights to ensure their full enjoyment.

*   **The “Prescribed by Law” Requirement:** The Court held that the ordinance’s provision allowing the Commissioner of Police to restrict public processions for the purpose of “public order” did not satisfy the constitutional requirement of “prescribed by law.” The definition of “public order” was deemed too vague and imprecise, lacking the necessary clarity for individuals to understand and comply with the law. The Court drew heavily on international jurisprudence, particularly the United States Supreme Court’s decision in *Saia v. New York*, which established a “standardless sweep” as unacceptable.

*   **Proportionality as a Test:** The Court adopted a proportionality test to assess the constitutionality of restrictions on fundamental rights. This test requires that any restriction must be rationally connected to a legitimate purpose and no more than is necessary to achieve that purpose. The Court recognized that the government has a legitimate interest in maintaining public order, but that this interest must be balanced against the right to peaceful assembly.

*   **The Concept of “Public Order” – Narrowed:** The Court significantly narrowed the scope of “public order” as it applies to the ordinance. It recognized that “public order” does not encompass a broad range of concerns, such as preventing all forms of disruption or suppressing dissent. It is primarily concerned with maintaining public safety and preventing disorder.

*   **Severance of Unconstitutional Provisions:** The Court ruled that section 17A of the ordinance, which created criminal offences for failing to notify the police of a procession, was unconstitutional and should be severed from the rest of the ordinance. The Court reasoned that section 17A was inextricably linked to the unconstitutional provisions regarding “public order” and could not stand on its own.

*   **Positive Duty on the Government:** The Court affirmed the government’s positive duty to take reasonable and appropriate measures to enable lawful assemblies to take place peacefully. This duty is not absolute, but it requires the government to facilitate the exercise of fundamental rights.

*   **Judicial Scrutiny and Safeguards:** The Court underscored the judiciary’s role in safeguarding fundamental rights and ensuring that governmental powers are exercised within constitutional limits. It emphasized the need for judicial scrutiny of discretionary powers and the importance of providing clear guidelines to prevent abuse of power.

*   **The Importance of Certainty:** The Court highlighted the importance of legal certainty in protecting fundamental rights. It argued that laws restricting fundamental rights must be clearly and precisely defined to allow individuals to understand their obligations and to challenge any unlawful restrictions.

**Novel or Controversial Points:**

*   **Narrowing “Public Order” to a Specific Standard:** The Court’s decision to significantly narrow the scope of “public order” was arguably the most novel and controversial aspect of the ruling. It established a more restrictive interpretation of this concept than had been previously accepted, placing greater limits on the government’s ability to restrict public assemblies.

*   **Emphasis on Proportionality:** The Court’s explicit adoption of a proportionality test as the standard for assessing the constitutionality of restrictions on fundamental rights was a significant development. This approach aligns with international jurisprudence but represents a more rigorous standard than had been applied in previous cases.

*   **Severance of Section 17A:** The decision to sever section 17A from the rest of the ordinance was also noteworthy. While the Court acknowledged the need for some deterrent to ensure compliance with notification requirements, it argued that section 17A was inextricably linked to the unconstitutional provisions regarding “public order” and could not be upheld.

*   **The “Standardless Sweep” Concept:** The Court’s reliance on the “standardless sweep” concept, borrowed from *Saia v. New York*, signaled a commitment to protecting fundamental rights against arbitrary or discretionary restrictions.

In essence, the *Leung Kwok Hung* case represents a significant victory for the protection of fundamental rights in Hong Kong. It established a more restrictive interpretation of the ordinance’s provisions and affirmed the judiciary’s role in safeguarding these rights against governmental overreach. The decision has implications for a wide range of public gatherings and protests in Hong Kong, requiring the government to exercise greater caution and transparency in restricting these activities.
