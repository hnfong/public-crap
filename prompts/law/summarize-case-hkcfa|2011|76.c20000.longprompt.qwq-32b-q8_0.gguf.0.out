Okay, let's tackle this case. First, I need to go through the user's query and the provided case details. The user has given me a detailed judgment from the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal in Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v Chan Chun Chuen and Another. They want me to summarize the facts, the arguments of both parties, the legal principles (ratio decidendi), and note anything striking about the case.

Starting with the facts. The case is about a will dispute after the death of Mrs. Nina Wang in 2007. The Foundation, which was named as the beneficiary in her 2002 will, sought to validate that will and invalidate the 2006 will proposed by the applicant, Chan Chun Chuen. The trial court found the 2006 will a forgery, and the Court of Appeal upheld that decision. Now, the applicant is seeking leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal.

Next, the arguments of the two parties. The applicant is arguing for leave to appeal under two limbs of section 22(1)(a) of the Court's statute, claiming the value of the estate exceeds $1 million. He also argues on discretionary grounds, suggesting the case involves important legal questions, like the court's practice on concurrent findings of fact. The Foundation counters that the applicant's claims don't meet the threshold for an "as of right" appeal and that the discretionary grounds aren't strong enough.

For the legal principles, the key points are the interpretation of section 22(1)(a), especially the "as of right" provision. The court reaffirmed that this applies only to liquidated claims, not unliquidated or indirect claims. The case also deals with the court's practice on concurrent findings of fact, emphasizing that they won't overturn such findings unless there's a miscarriage of justice or legal error. The court also addressed the introduction of new evidence, finding it insufficient to justify overturning the prior decisions.

Now, anything striking? The case involves a high-value estate, which is notable. The legal battle over the will's validity after a lengthy trial and appeals is significant. The court's emphasis on maintaining the finality of concurrent findings and the narrow interpretation of the "as of right" appeal are important points. Also, the mention of the "partial will" and the attesting witnesses' credibility adds complexity. The court's suggestion that the "as of right" appeals should be reconsidered is a forward-looking point that might be interesting.

Wait, I need to make sure I didn't miss any key points. The ratio decidendi should focus on the legal principles applied. The court's analysis of the "immediacy requirement" under section 22(1)(a) is crucial here. They determined that because the 2006 will's validity didn't immediately quantify the estate's division (due to the need to resolve whether it was a partial will or codicil), the threshold wasn't met. Also, the discussion on concurrent findings and the rejection of the applicant's challenge to that practice is central.

The striking aspect might be the sheer value of the estate, given Nina Wang's background with the Chinachem Group, which is a major Hong Kong company. The case's procedural history, with a 40-day trial and multiple appeals, shows the intensity of the dispute. The court's mention of re-evaluating the "as of right" appeals in the future is also a notable point, indicating potential future legal changes.

I should structure each section clearly, ensuring that the facts are concise, the arguments are summarized without bias, the legal principles are detailed with the key holdings, and the striking elements are highlighted. Need to avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text as per the user's request.

### 1. Summary of Facts  
The case concerns a dispute over the validity of two wills of Mrs. Nina Wang, who died in 2007. The Chinachem Charitable Foundation (Foundation), named as the sole beneficiary in her 2002 will, sought to validate that will and invalidate a later 2006 will propounded by the applicant, Chan Chun Chuen, who claimed the entire estate. After a 40-day trial, the High Court found the 2006 will a forgery, primarily based on evidence from attesting witnesses and forensic analysis (e.g., ESDA testing showing a "perfect register" suggesting tampering). The Court of Appeal upheld this decision. The applicant then sought leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal (CFA), arguing the case met the $1 million threshold for an "as of right" appeal and raised important legal questions.  

### 2. Summary of Arguments  
**Applicant (Chan Chun Chuen):**  
- **As of Right Ground (§22(1)(a)):** Argued the appeal involved a claim to property exceeding $1 million, as the 2006 will’s validity would entitle him to the entire estate. Cited probate cases (e.g., *Wang Din-shin v Nina Kung*) where similar claims were treated as "indirect" property claims.  
- **Discretionary Ground (§22(1)(b)):** Contended the case raised a "great general or public importance" question about the CFA’s practice of deferring to concurrent findings of fact (e.g., whether the court should abandon its reluctance to overturn such findings).  
- **"Or Otherwise" Ground:** Alleged the Court of Appeal’s judgment was inadequate, failing to address key issues, thereby negating concurrent findings.  
- **New Evidence Ground:** Submitted newly discovered police statements from a key witness (Winfield Wong) undermined the trial court’s credibility findings, justifying a review of the forgery conclusion.  

**Respondent (Foundation):**  
- Opposed the "as of right" claim, arguing the 2006 will’s validity did not directly quantify the estate’s division (due to unresolved issues like whether it was a partial will or codicil). Thus, the claim was unliquidated and indirect.  
- Rejected the discretionary grounds, emphasizing the CFA’s established practice of deferring to concurrent findings unless a miscarriage of justice or legal error was shown.  
- Disputed the "new evidence" argument, asserting the police statements were inconsequential to the core factual findings (e.g., the "partial will" nature of the 2006 document).

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  

#### **A. Interpretation of §22(1)(a) – "As of Right" Appeal**  
The court reaffirmed the narrow construction of the "as of right" provision:  
1. **Liquidated vs. Unliquidated Claims:** The threshold applies only to *liquidated* monetary claims. Unliquidated or indirect claims (e.g., probate contests where the estate’s division depends on further factual determinations) do not qualify.  
   - **Key Holding:** The 2006 will’s validity did not immediately quantify the applicant’s entitlement because the trial judge had yet to resolve whether it was a partial will (revoking only part of the 2002 will) or a full codicil. Thus, the claim was unliquidated, disqualifying it under §22(1)(a).  
2. **"Indirect" Claims:** While probate cases may involve indirect property claims (e.g., *Wang Din-shin*), the "immediacy requirement" must be met: the appeal’s outcome must directly confer a quantifiable benefit. Here, unresolved issues (e.g., the will’s construction) meant the financial impact was not immediate.  

#### **B. Concurrent Findings of Fact**  
The court upheld its longstanding practice of deferring to concurrent findings of fact from lower courts unless a miscarriage of justice or legal error is shown:  
1. **Policy Rationale:**  
   - Final appellate courts should focus on legal issues of general importance, not re-litigate factual disputes.  
   - Repeated factual reviews risk prolonging litigation and wasting resources.  
2. **Application to This Case:**  
   - The applicant failed to demonstrate any miscarriage of justice or legal error in the trial court’s findings (e.g., the attesting witnesses’ credibility, forensic evidence).  
   - The Court of Appeal’s judgment adequately addressed key issues, including the "partial will" evidence and inherent improbabilities of forgery.  

#### **C. Introduction of New Evidence**  
The court rejected the applicant’s reliance on new police statements:  
1. **Inconsequential Discrepancies:** The statements did not undermine the core factual findings (e.g., the "partial will" nature of the 2006 document). Minor inconsistencies (e.g., the beneficiary’s name) were deemed irrelevant to the forgery conclusion.  
2. **Credibility of Key Witness (Winfield Wong):** The trial judge’s acceptance of Wong’s testimony was corroborated by other evidence (e.g., Ng Shun Mo’s account of Wong’s statements). The police statements did not show Wong "recanted" his critical evidence about the document’s partial nature.  

#### **D. Forward-Looking Comment on "As of Right" Appeals**  
The court noted that the "as of right" provision, inherited from the pre-1997 Privy Council regime, may warrant reconsideration. Most Commonwealth jurisdictions have abandoned such appeals to final courts, emphasizing the need to prioritize legal over factual disputes.

### 4. Striking or Unusual Aspects of the Case  
1. **Estate Value and Procedural Complexity:** The case involved a high-stakes estate (likely billions of dollars, given Nina Wang’s ties to the Chinachem Group, a major Hong Kong conglomerate). The 40-day trial and multiple appeals highlight the intensity of the dispute.  
2. **Forensic Evidence:** The use of ESDA ("perfect register") analysis to detect forgery added a technical layer to the legal battle, illustrating modern forensic methods in probate cases.  
3. **Attorney-Client Dynamics:** The role of Mr. Sujanani, Nina Wang’s barrister, in drafting witness statements and influencing testimony raised ethical questions about lawyer influence on factual narratives.  
4. **Cultural and Familial Context:** Nina Wang’s charitable activities and family relationships (e.g., her siblings’ roles) added a human dimension to the legal contest, reflecting personal and institutional stakes.  
5. **Court’s Forward-Looking Stance:** The court’s suggestion to reconsider "as of right" appeals signals a potential shift in Hong Kong’s legal framework, aligning with global trends toward final appellate courts focusing on legal, not factual, issues.  

This case exemplifies the intersection of complex factual disputes, procedural hurdles, and evolving legal principles in high-value probate litigation. [end of text]
