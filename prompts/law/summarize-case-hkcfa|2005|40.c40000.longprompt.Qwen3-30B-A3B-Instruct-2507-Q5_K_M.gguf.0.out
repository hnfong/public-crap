### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case, *Leung Kwok Hung and Others v. HKSAR* [2005] HKCFA 40, arose from a peaceful public procession held on **10 February 2002** in Hong Kong. The procession, organized by political activists including Leung Kwok Hung (the 1st appellant), began at Chater Garden and proceeded along Queensway to Police Headquarters in Arsenal Street. It was intended as a protest against the conviction of an activist for assaulting and obstructing a police officer. The procession started with about 40 participants and grew to around 96 people. Although the participants remained peaceful throughout, they did **not notify the Commissioner of Police** in advance, as required by the Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245), and ignored police advice to use the pedestrian pavement, instead walking in the left traffic lane.

The Chief Magistrate convicted the 1st appellant of holding an unauthorized assembly and the 2nd and 3rd appellants of assisting in such an act under **Section 17A(3)(b)(i)** of the Ordinance. They were each bound over for $500 for three months. The appellants appealed, arguing that the statutory scheme for regulating public processions was unconstitutional, particularly the broad discretion granted to the Commissioner of Police to restrict peaceful assemblies on the grounds of “public order (ordre public).” The appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal, which upheld the convictions. The appellants then sought and obtained leave to appeal to the **Court of Final Appeal (CFA)**, which ultimately dismissed the appeal, upholding the convictions.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties

#### **Appellants’ Arguments:**
The appellants, led by prominent pro-democracy activist Leung Kwok Hung, argued that the **statutory scheme under the Public Order Ordinance** was **unconstitutional** because it granted the Commissioner of Police **unfettered and overly broad discretion** to restrict the right to peaceful assembly on the grounds of “public order (ordre public).” They contended that:
- The concept of “public order (ordre public)” is **too vague and imprecise** to satisfy the constitutional requirement of “prescribed by law,” which demands legal certainty.
- The lack of clear standards meant that the Commissioner could restrict peaceful assemblies based on subjective or arbitrary judgments, undermining the right to free assembly.
- The scheme allowed for **prior restraint** (i.e., banning or controlling a procession before it happens) without sufficient safeguards, which is inherently dangerous to fundamental rights.
- The absence of a requirement for the Commissioner to justify decisions with **adequate reasons** and the lack of a **judicial check** before the event made the system prone to abuse.
- The **criminal sanctions** under Section 17A were therefore invalid because they were tied to an unconstitutional framework.

They emphasized that the right to peaceful assembly is **fundamental to a democratic society**, and that any restriction must be **narrowly tailored, proportionate, and subject to rigorous judicial scrutiny**.

#### **Respondent’s (Government’s) Arguments:**
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government, represented by Mr. Gerard McCoy SC, defended the constitutionality of the Ordinance, arguing that:
- The statutory scheme was **designed to balance individual rights with public order and safety**, especially in a densely populated city like Hong Kong.
- The **notification requirement** was reasonable and necessary to allow police to plan for crowd control, traffic management, and public safety.
- The Commissioner’s discretion to object or impose conditions was **not unlimited**—it was constrained by the need to act reasonably and in the interests of national security, public safety, or public order.
- The **proportionality test** was implicitly embedded in the statutory language and could be applied by the courts.
- The **Appeal Board** and **judicial review** provided adequate safeguards against abuse.
- The concept of “public order (ordre public)” was **not unconstitutionally vague** because it had been interpreted consistently in international law and domestic jurisprudence.
- The **remedy** should not be to strike down the law but to **read down** the term “public order (ordre public)” to mean only “serious disruption to the life of the community,” which would make it more precise.

The government maintained that the law was **not arbitrary**, had been **widely used without abuse**, and was **consistent with the ICCPR and the Basic Law**.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) – Detailed and Thorough

The **ratio decidendi** of *Leung Kwok Hung v. HKSAR* is one of the most significant constitutional decisions in Hong Kong’s post-handover history. It establishes a **robust framework for the protection of fundamental rights**, particularly the **right to peaceful assembly**, and sets a **high threshold for the constitutionality of laws that restrict such rights**. The judgment is notable for its **deep engagement with international human rights law**, **proportionality analysis**, and **the doctrine of legal certainty**.

#### **A. The Right to Peaceful Assembly is a Fundamental Constitutional Right**

The Court begins by affirming that the **freedom of peaceful assembly is a fundamental right**, closely linked to freedom of speech and expression. It is **not merely a privilege but a cornerstone of democratic society**, essential for open dialogue, airing grievances, and holding power to account. The Court emphasizes that **minority views**, even if unpopular or offensive, must be protected in a pluralistic society. This reflects a **liberal democratic conception of rights**, where the state’s role is not to suppress dissent but to **facilitate its expression**.

#### **B. The “Prescribed by Law” Requirement and the Doctrine of Legal Certainty**

The central legal issue is whether the Commissioner of Police’s discretion to restrict peaceful assemblies on the grounds of “public order (ordre public)” satisfies the **constitutional requirement of “prescribed by law”**.

- The Court holds that **a law restricting a fundamental right must be sufficiently precise and accessible** to enable individuals to regulate their conduct. This is the **principle of legal certainty**, which is essential to the rule of law.
- The Court draws on **international jurisprudence**, particularly the **European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR)**, to define the standard: a law must be **adequately accessible** and **formulated with sufficient precision** so that a reasonable person can foresee the consequences of their actions.
- The Court acknowledges that **some vagueness is inevitable**, especially in complex areas like public order. However, **the level of precision must be appropriate to the subject matter**. In the case of **discretionary powers that affect fundamental rights**, the standard must be **higher**.
- The concept of **“public order (ordre public)”** is **inherently vague and expansive**. It includes not only the prevention of violence and disorder but also broader societal values such as the functioning of public institutions, public health, and even moral considerations. As the Court notes, it is “an imprecise and elusive one” that cannot be reduced to a rigid formula.
- The Court finds that **incorporating this vague constitutional concept directly into a statutory discretion**—without clear guidelines—**fails the “prescribed by law” test**. The Commissioner’s discretion is **not adequately circumscribed**, leaving too much room for arbitrary or subjective decision-making.

This is a **novel and controversial point**: the Court **invalidates a statutory provision not because it is vague per se, but because it imports a vague constitutional concept into a discretionary power without sufficient safeguards**. This is a **departure from the traditional view** that constitutional rights can be interpreted broadly, but it reflects a **modern, rights-protective approach**.

#### **C. The Proportionality Test and the Necessity Requirement**

The Court applies a **proportionality test** to assess whether any restriction on the right to peaceful assembly is “necessary in a democratic society.” This test has two limbs:
1. **Rational connection**: The restriction must be rationally connected to a legitimate purpose.
2. **Least restrictive means**: The restriction must be no more than is necessary to achieve that purpose.

The Court emphasizes that **proportionality is not optional**—it is **a constitutional requirement**. Even if a restriction is justified by a legitimate purpose (e.g., public order), it must still pass the proportionality test.

- The Court finds that **“public order (ordre public)” as a statutory purpose is too broad** to allow for a meaningful proportionality assessment. The Commissioner could restrict an assembly based on **mere suspicion** or **subjective concerns**, without needing to show a **direct and imminent threat**.
- The Court contrasts this with **German constitutional law**, where the Bundesverfassungsgericht requires that bans or dispersals only occur when there is a **“direct endangering”** of public order, based on **recognisable circumstances**, not mere suspicion.
- The Court also notes that **prior restraint** (banning an event before it happens) is **more intrusive** than post-event sanctions and thus requires **even stricter justification**.

This is **a significant development** in Hong Kong’s constitutional law: the Court **elevates proportionality to a constitutional standard**, not just a judicial discretion.

#### **D. Severance as a Remedy – A Groundbreaking Approach**

The most **remarkable and controversial aspect** of the judgment is the **remedy of severance**.
