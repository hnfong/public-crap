Hmm, I need to analyze this Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal case about the right of abode. The user has provided the full judgment and asked for four specific tasks: facts summary, arguments summary, legal principles analysis, and any remarkable observations.

First, the facts involve four applicants born in mainland China to Hong Kong permanent resident fathers. They entered Hong Kong around July 1997 claiming right of abode under Article 24(2) of the Basic Law. The Director of Immigration detained them, arguing they needed exit permits from mainland authorities under a new ordinance. Key legislation includes the Immigration (Amendment) No. 2 and No. 3 Ordinances enacted by the Provisional Legislative Council, which introduced certificate of entitlement requirements tied to mainland exit permits.

For the arguments, the applicants claimed unconditional right of abode under Basic Law Article 24, while the Director argued this was qualified by Article 22(4) requiring mainland approval. There were also disputes about legitimacy requirements for children born out of wedlock and the validity of retrospective legislation.

The legal principles section requires deep analysis. The court made several groundbreaking constitutional determinations: that Hong Kong courts can review NPC/SCNPC acts for Basic Law compliance, established a "predominant provision" test for Article 158 references, and interpreted Articles 24 and 22(4) as mutually exclusive. The generous interpretation approach to constitutional rights and severance doctrine application are also crucial.

What's remarkable includes the court's bold assertion of judicial review over sovereign acts - unprecedented in Chinese constitutional history. The case triggered the first-ever Article 158 reference to the SCNPC shortly after this judgment, showing the delicate balance between Hong Kong's autonomy and central authority. The court's handling of discrimination against illegitimate children through ICCPR principles is also noteworthy.

The user seems knowledgeable about legal analysis given the structured request. They're likely a law student or professional researching Hong Kong constitutional law. The depth of their query suggests interest in how common law principles interact with China's socialist legal system. I should maintain precise legal terminology while ensuring clarity on complex constitutional concepts.

### Summary of the Case: *Ng Ka Ling v. Director of Immigration* [1999] HKCFA 72

---

### 1. **Brief Summary of Facts**  
The case involved four Mainland-born Chinese nationals claiming the right of abode in Hong Kong as permanent residents under **Article 24(2)** of the Hong Kong Basic Law. All had at least one parent who was a Hong Kong permanent resident:  
- **Ng Ka Ling & Ng Tan Tan** (sisters, born 1987/1989): Entered Hong Kong illegally on July 1, 1997.  
- **Tsui Kuen Nang** (born 1978): Entered illegally on July 1, 1997.  
- **Cheung Lai Wah** (born 1989, out of wedlock): Entered legally in 1994 but overstayed.  

The Director of Immigration detained them, arguing they lacked valid exit permits ("one-way permits") from Mainland authorities and certificates of entitlement under the **Immigration (Amendment) No. 3 Ordinance (No. 3 Ordinance)**, enacted retrospectively on July 10, 1997. The applicants challenged the constitutionality of this scheme and related laws.  

---

### 2. **Summary of Arguments**  
#### **Applicants' Arguments**:  
- **Right of Abode**: Unconditional under **Article 24(3)** of the Basic Law for permanent residents.  
- **No. 3 Ordinance**: Unconstitutional for requiring a Mainland exit permit to exercise the right, violating autonomy.  
- **Retrospectivity**: Applying the No. 3 Ordinance to pre-enactment arrivals unlawfully deprived vested rights.  
- **Discrimination**: The Immigration Ordinance’s distinction against children born out of wedlock (**para 1(2)(b)**) violated equality principles.  
- **Provisional Legislative Council (PLC)**: Illegally constituted, rendering its laws invalid.  

#### **Director's Arguments**:  
- **Article 22(4) Qualification**: "People from other parts of China" (including applicants) required Mainland exit approval per **Article 22(4)**, limiting Article 24.  
- **No. 3 Ordinance**: Valid verification mechanism for permanent resident status.  
- **Retrospectivity**: Lawful to address urgent immigration concerns post-handover.  
- **Legitimacy Requirement**: **Para 1(2)(b)** validly excluded non-legitimated children from claiming descent-based residency.  
- **PLC Legality**: Established lawfully under the National People’s Congress (NPC) Decision (1990).

### 3. **Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**  
#### **A. Constitutional Jurisdiction of Hong Kong Courts**  
- **Power of Judicial Review**: Hong Kong courts can examine the constitutionality of **all legislation** (including NPC/SCNPC acts) against the Basic Law and invalidate inconsistencies.  
- **Rejection of Colonial Analogy**: Unlike colonial-era restrictions, Article 19(2) of the Basic Law does not bar review of sovereign acts. The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) overruled *HKSAR v. Ma Wai Kwan*, affirming this power as essential to Hong Kong’s autonomy.  

#### **B. Interpretation of the Basic Law**  
- **Purposive & Generous Approach**:  
  - **Article 24 (Right of Abode)**: Must be interpreted generously as a "core right" integral to other freedoms (e.g., voting).  
  - **Article 22(4) vs. Article 24**:  
    - **Article 22(4)** (requiring exit approval) applies **only to non-permanent residents** ("people from other parts of China").  
    - **Permanent residents** are not "people from other parts of China"; their right of abode is **unqualified**.  
  - **Contextual Harmony**: Article 22(4) governs immigration control for non-residents; Article 24 guarantees residents’ unconditional entry.  

#### **C. Article 158 Reference Mechanism**  
- **"Predominant Provision" Test**:  
  - A reference to the SCNPC is required **only if** the "excluded provision" (e.g., Article 22(4)) is the **predominant issue** needing interpretation.  
  - Here, Article 24 was predominant; Article 22(4)’s relevance did not trigger a reference.  

#### **D. Constitutionality of the No. 3 Ordinance**  
- **One-Way Permit Requirement**: Unconstitutional for subordinating Article 24 rights to Mainland discretion, violating Hong Kong’s autonomy.  
- **Certificate of Entitlement**: **Valid** as a verification tool but **severed** from the exit-permit linkage.  
- **Severance Doctrine**: Unconstitutional portions (e.g., travel document linkage) excised while preserving the verification framework.  
- **Retrospectivity**: Void for criminalizing pre-enactment arrivals (*ex post facto* violation of ICCPR Article 15).  

#### **E. Discrimination Against Children Born Out of Wedlock**  
- **Article 24(2)**: Includes children born out of wedlock ("persons born of" residents).  
- **ICCPr & Equality Principles**: **Para 1(2)(b)** of the Immigration Ordinance (requiring legitimation for paternal ties) violated:  
  - **Article 25** (Basic Law) and **Article 26** (ICCPR) equality guarantees.  
  - **Family Unity**: Exclusion undermined the family’s protection under ICCPR Article 23(1).  

#### **F. Validity of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC)**  
- **Lawful Under NPC Decision (1990)**: The PLC was a valid interim body established by the Preparatory Committee to address the legislative vacuum post-handover, consistent with the Basic Law.

### 4. **Striking/Remarkable Aspects**  
1. **Assertion of Judicial Power**:  
   - The CFA boldly declared authority to review **NPC/SCNPC acts**—unprecedented in China’s constitutional history—asserting Hong Kong’s judicial autonomy. This triggered the SCNPC’s first interpretation of the Basic Law in December 1999, partially overriding the judgment.  

2. **"Predominant Provision" Test**:  
   - The novel test for Article 158 references redefined Hong Kong’s interpretive autonomy, limiting SCNPC interventions to cases where central affairs are the core issue.  

3. **Severance of Unconstitutional Provisions**:  
   - The court meticulously excised offending clauses (e.g., one-way permit requirements) while preserving the verification scheme—a rare, pragmatic approach in constitutional litigation.  

4. **Retrospective Criminalization**:  
   - The retrospective application of the No. 3 Ordinance would have rendered pre-enactment arrivals "instant criminals." The court’s reliance on ICCPR Article 15 highlighted the fusion of international human rights into Hong Kong’s constitutional order.  

5. **Historic Context**:  
   - Decided just 18 months post-handover, the case tested "one country, two systems" amid fears of mainland immigration. The CFA’s robust defense of resident rights became a landmark in Hong Kong’s constitutional identity.  

---  
**Conclusion**: This case is a cornerstone of Hong Kong constitutional law, defining the judiciary’s role in upholding autonomy and fundamental rights against legislative and executive overreach. Its legacy endures in the tension between Hong Kong’s common law traditions and Beijing’s sovereign authority. [end of text]
