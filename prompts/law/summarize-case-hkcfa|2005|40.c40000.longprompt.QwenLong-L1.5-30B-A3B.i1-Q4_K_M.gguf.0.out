Okay, let's tackle this case summary. The user provided a detailed judgment from the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal in the case of Leung Kwok Hung and Others v. HKSAR. The task is to break it down into four parts: facts, arguments, legal principles (ratio decidendi), and any striking aspects.

First, I need to summarize the facts briefly. The case involves a public procession that the appellants organized without notifying the police, leading to their conviction under the Public Order Ordinance. The key points are the procession from Chater Garden to Police Headquarters, the refusal to comply with notification requirements, and the subsequent conviction. The appeal challenged the constitutionality of the Ordinance's provisions regarding public processions.

Next, the arguments of the two parties. The appellants argued that the Commissioner's discretion to restrict assemblies for "public order (ordre public)" was too vague and uncertain, violating the constitutional requirements. The government (respondent) defended the Ordinance, saying it was necessary for public order and that the discretion was properly constrained. The government also mentioned the positive duty of the government to facilitate peaceful assemblies.

Now, the legal principles. This is the meaty part. The court had to determine if the Ordinance's provisions met the constitutional requirements of "prescribed by law" and "necessity in a democratic society." The key issue was the vagueness of "public order (ordre public)." The court held that while "ordre public" is a constitutional concept, using it in the Ordinance for the Commissioner's discretion was too vague. They severed "public order" (meaning maintenance of public order and prevention of disorder) from "public order (ordre public)" to make the discretion constitutional. The court emphasized the need for legal certainty, especially for restrictions on fundamental rights. They also discussed the proportionality test, requiring that restrictions be rationally connected and no more than necessary.

Wait, the court split into two judgments. Chief Justice Li and the majority upheld the convictions, while Mr. Justice Bokhary dissented. Bokhary argued that the entire prior restraint powers were unconstitutional, but the majority focused on severing the term. I need to make sure to clarify that the majority's ratio decidendi was about severing "public order" from "ordre public," not striking down the whole Ordinance.

For the legal principles, I should detail the constitutional requirements: "prescribed by law" and necessity. The court explained that "prescribed by law" requires sufficient precision, and "ordre public" as used in the Ordinance didn't meet that. The majority's approach to severance is important here. They applied the severance test from Ming Pao Newspapers, holding that the valid part (public order) could stand alone. Also, the court stressed the positive duty of the government to facilitate peaceful assemblies, referencing the European Convention case Plattform 'Ärzte für das Leben'.

Novel or controversial points: The court's interpretation of "ordre public" as too vague in the statutory context, even though it's a constitutional term. The severance approach was key—separating the constitutional concept from the statutory application. Also, the emphasis on legal certainty for fundamental rights, which is a recurring theme in human rights jurisprudence. The court's rejection of reading down "ordre public" to "serious disruption" or to Article 20 of the ICCPR is notable.

Striking or unusual aspects: The appellants were activists challenging the law to advance free assembly, which is a common tactic. The case involved a procession protesting another activist's conviction, adding a layer of irony. The court's detailed discussion of the historical context of free assembly, referencing cases from various jurisdictions, shows the depth of the analysis. Also, the split in the judgment—Li CJ upholding the convictions while Bokhary dissenting—highlights the complexity of the issue. The fact that the court focused on severance rather than striking down the entire Ordinance is a significant procedural point.

Wait, the user mentioned the case is from 2005, and the appellants were convicted under the Ordinance. The majority upheld the convictions because the issue was with the "public order (ordre public)" part, not the notification requirement. So the convictions for not notifying the police stood, but the constitutional challenge was about the discretion related to "ordre public." That's important to clarify in the facts and legal principles.

I need to make sure not to confuse the two parts: the notification requirement was upheld as constitutional, but the Commissioner's discretion regarding "ordre public" was struck down (after severance). So the convictions were based on the notification violation, not the discretion, hence the appeal was dismissed.

Also, the court's discussion of the positive duty of the government to facilitate assemblies, citing the government's own report, is a key point. The government acknowledged this duty, which the court used to support the need for reasonable notification requirements.

For the legal principles, the proportionality test is crucial. The court linked the necessity requirement to proportionality, requiring that restrictions be rationally connected and no more than necessary. The majority held that after severance, the discretion for "public order" (the narrower term) satisfied this test.

Wait, the court said that "public order (ordre public)" was unconstitutional, but "public order" (without the "ordre public") was valid. So they severed the two, leaving "public order" as the valid term. The court had to determine that "public order" (law and order sense) is sufficiently certain, which it is, unlike the broader "ordre public."

I should check if the court's reasoning on severance is correctly explained. The majority applied the severance test from Ming Pao, concluding that the legislature would have enacted the statute with just "public order" if they knew the rest was invalid. So the valid part remains.

Another point: the court rejected the government's suggestion to read down "ordre public" to "serious disruption" or to Article 20 of the ICCPR. The reasoning was that those readings weren't supported by the text, and the constitutional norm of "ordre public" is broader, but the statutory use needed to be precise.

The dissenting judgment by Bokhary was more radical, striking down all prior restraint powers, but the majority didn't go that far. The user's task asks for the ratio decidendi, which is the majority's view, so I should focus on that.

For the striking aspects, the case is notable for its detailed analysis of legal certainty in the context of fundamental rights, the use of severance to save part of the law, and the historical references to free assembly. Also, the appellants were known activists, which might have made the case more high-profile.

Wait, the user mentioned "anything striking, unusual or remarkable." The fact that the appellants deliberately brought the case to challenge the law, as noted in Mr. Justice Bokhary's judgment, is a key point. They were using the case to advance the cause of free assembly, which is a strategic move. Also, the court's emphasis on the positive duty of the government to facilitate assemblies, which is a bit different from the usual focus on restrictions.

Another point: the court referenced the European Convention and other jurisdictions extensively, showing a comparative approach. The use of the "thali domide" case (Sunday Times) to explain legal certainty is a good example.

I need to make sure the summary of legal principles covers the constitutional requirements, the analysis of "prescribed by law," the severance, and the proportionality test. Also, clarify that the necessity requirement was satisfied after severance.

Wait, the court said that after severance, the discretion for "public order" satisfies the necessity requirement because it's limited to processions over 30 people on public roads, and the Commissioner must apply the proportionality test. So the valid part is constrained, which meets the constitutional standards.

The user asked for the ratio decidendi to be detailed and thorough. So I need to explain the two constitutional requirements, how the court applied them, the analysis of "ordre public," the severance, and the conclusion that the discretion for "public order" is valid.

Also, the court's rejection of the government's arguments about the necessity of the broad "ordre public" term. The government argued that it's necessary for public order, but the court said the term itself is too vague, so it fails the "prescribed by law" requirement.

Wait, the constitutional requirement is "prescribed by law," which requires the law to be precise enough for citizens to understand. The court held that "ordre public" as used in the Ordinance doesn't meet that because it's too broad and vague. So the discretion is unconstitutional, but by severing it to "public order," which is a narrower term, the discretion becomes constitutional.

I should also mention the distinction between the constitutional concept of "ordre public" and its statutory application. The constitutional term is abstract, but the statutory use needs to be precise. The court made that distinction clear.

For the arguments, the appellants' main point was the vagueness of "ordre public," while the government argued that the discretion was properly constrained and necessary. The government also cited the positive duty of the government to facilitate assemblies, which the court acknowledged but didn't rely on for the constitutional challenge.

Wait, the government's argument included that the notification requirement is necessary for the positive duty, which the court agreed with. But the challenge was about the "ordre public" part, not the notification. So the government's defense of the notification requirement was separate from the constitutional challenge.

In the legal principles, the court's discussion of the positive duty is important because it's a counterbalance to the restrictions. The government must take reasonable measures to enable peaceful assemblies, which is why notification is allowed. But the Commissioner's discretion to restrict based on "ordre public" was the problem.

I need to structure the legal principles section to first explain the constitutional requirements, then the analysis of "ordre public" as a statutory term, the severance, and the proportionality test. Highlight the novelty in the court's approach to severance and the emphasis on legal certainty for fundamental rights.

Also, the court's reference to the European Court of Human Rights cases, like Malone v. UK, which dealt with legal certainty in the context of privacy. That's a key precedent they cited.

Wait, the user mentioned "points that might be novel or controversial." The court's decision to sever "public order" from "ordre public" is a novel approach in this context. It's not common to sever a term within a statute like that. The court's reasoning that "public order" (the narrower term) is sufficiently certain, while "ordre public" is not, is a key point. Also, the court's rejection of reading down the term to "serious disruption" or Article 20 shows a strict textual approach.

Another controversial point might be the court's stance on the necessity requirement. They required the proportionality test, which is standard, but emphasizing that the statutory discretion must be constrained by that test. The court made it clear that the Commissioner must apply the proportionality test, which is a significant check on executive power.

For the striking aspects, the fact that the appellants were activists who deliberately provoked the prosecution to challenge the law is notable. It's a strategic use of the legal system to test constitutional boundaries. Also, the case is a landmark in Hong Kong's human rights jurisprudence, especially regarding freedom of assembly. The court's detailed historical and comparative analysis adds to its significance.

Wait, the case is from 2005, and it's a key case in Hong Kong's legal history. The court's decision to uphold the notification requirement but strike down the broad discretion for "ordre public" is a balanced approach. The majority didn't invalidate the entire Ordinance, which shows judicial restraint.

I should also mention that the court referenced the Basic Law and the ICCPR, emphasizing that Hong Kong's rights are protected under both. The incorporation of the ICCPR into the Bill of Rights Ordinance is a key point.

Wait, the court noted that Article 20 of the ICCPR (about propaganda for war and hate speech) wasn't incorporated into the BORO, so the government's argument to read down "ordre public" to Article 20 was rejected. That's an important detail.

Okay, putting it all together. The facts are the procession without notification, conviction, appeal. Arguments: appellants say "ordre public" is too vague; government says it's necessary and properly constrained. Legal principles: constitutional requirements of "prescribed by law" and necessity; "ordre public" too vague in statute, so severance to "public order" is needed; proportionality test applies. Striking aspects: strategic challenge by activists, detailed legal analysis, severance approach, historical context.

Wait, the user asked for the ratio decidendi to be detailed. So the key legal principles are:

1. The constitutional requirements for restricting fundamental rights: "prescribed by law" and "necessity in a democratic society."

2. The "prescribed by law" requirement demands sufficient precision; "ordre public" as used in the Ordinance fails this because it's too broad and vague.

3. The court severs "public order" (narrow sense) from "ordre public," making the discretion constitutional.

4. After severance, the discretion for "public order" satisfies the necessity requirement via the proportionality test.

5. The positive duty of the government to facilitate peaceful assemblies is acknowledged but doesn't override the need for precise statutory terms.

Also, the court's rejection of the government's proposed read-downs (to "serious disruption" or Article 20) is part of the legal reasoning.

I need to make sure that in the summary, these points are clearly laid out. The user wants it detailed, so I should explain each part thoroughly, especially the distinction between the constitutional concept and its statutory application.

Another point: the court emphasized that the legitimate purposes for restriction are exhaustive (national security, public safety, public order, protection of rights/freedoms), so the statute can't add other purposes. But the issue here was the vagueness of "public order (ordre public)" within those purposes.

Wait, the statute omitted "protection of public health or morals" from the ICCPR's list, but the court didn't focus on that. The main issue was "public order (ordre public)."

Also, the court's discussion of the "positive duty" of the government is important. They cited the government's own report acknowledging that duty, which supports the need for reasonable notification requirements. But the challenge was about the Commissioner's discretion to restrict, not the notification itself.

In the legal principles, I should clarify that the notification requirement was upheld as constitutional, but the Commissioner's discretion to restrict based on "ordre public" was invalid (after severance, it's valid for "public order"). So the convictions for not notifying stand, but the constitutional issue was about the discretion.

Wait, the court said the convictions were based on the notification requirement, not the discretion, so the appeal was dismissed. The constitutional challenge didn't affect the convictions. That's a key point to mention in the facts and legal principles.

Okay, I think I have all the elements. Now, structure the answer according to the four tasks. Make sure each part is concise but thorough, especially the legal principles. Avoid getting bogged down in too much detail on the dissenting judgment unless it's relevant to the ratio decidendi. The majority's view is the ratio.

Check for any possible misunderstandings. For example, the court didn't strike down the entire Ordinance, just the part related to "ordre public" as used in the Commissioner's discretion. The severance allowed the rest to stand. That's a crucial point.

Also, the court's application of the proportionality test: after severance, the discretion for "public order" is rationally connected and no more than necessary. The court lists factors like the limited scope (processions over 30 people on public roads), the Commissioner's duty to apply proportionality, the time limits for objections, and the appeal process.

I think that's covered. Now, time to write the summary.
</think>

### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts  
The case involves a public procession organized by Leung Kwok Hung (a prominent activist) and others on 10 February 2002 in Hong Kong. The procession, starting at Chater Garden and proceeding to Police Headquarters, comprised approximately 96 participants. The organizers refused to comply with the statutory notification requirement under the *Public Order Ordinance* (Cap. 245), despite police advice to do so. The procession was peaceful, but the organizers were convicted of holding an "unauthorized assembly" under s. 17A(3)(b)(i) of the Ordinance. The appellants appealed, challenging the constitutionality of the Ordinance’s statutory scheme regulating public processions, specifically arguing that the Commissioner of Police’s discretion to restrict assemblies for "public order (ordre public)" was too vague and uncertain to satisfy constitutional requirements. The Court of Appeal upheld the convictions, but the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) addressed the constitutional challenge. The CFA ultimately dismissed the appeal (upholding the convictions) but declared the Commissioner’s discretion to restrict assemblies for "public order (ordre public)" unconstitutional, severing "public order" (in the narrow sense of maintaining public order and preventing disorder) from "public order (ordre public)" to render the discretion constitutional.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties  
**Appellants’ Arguments**:  
The appellants (Leung Kwok Hung and others) argued that the *Public Order Ordinance*’s statutory scheme violated Hong Kong’s constitutional rights to peaceful assembly under the *Basic Law* (Art. 27) and the *Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance* (BORO, Art. 17). Their core contention was that the Commissioner of Police’s discretion to restrict assemblies for "public order (ordre public)" was unconstitutionally vague and uncertain, failing the "prescribed by law" requirement. They emphasized that "ordre public" is an imprecise constitutional concept (as recognized in *Ng Kung Siu*), but its statutory application in the Ordinance lacked sufficient precision, rendering the discretion arbitrary and incompatible with legal certainty. They urged the court to strike down the provision or read it down to a narrower term (e.g., "serious disruption to the life of the community" or the scope of ICCPR Art. 20).  

**Respondent’s (Government) Arguments**:  
The government defended the Ordinance, arguing that the Commissioner’s discretion to restrict assemblies for "public order (ordre public)" was sufficiently precise and necessary for public safety. It contended that "ordre public" is a well-established constitutional concept (as interpreted in *Ng Kung Siu* and *Secretary for Justice v. Oriental Press Group Ltd*), and the Ordinance’s incorporation of ICCPR standards provided adequate guidance. The government stressed the "positive duty" of the executive to facilitate peaceful assemblies (citing its own report to the UN Human Rights Committee) and argued that the notification requirement was essential for enabling such facilitation. It also rejected the appellants’ proposed read-downs, asserting that "ordre public" could not be narrowed to "serious disruption" or ICCPR Art. 20 without distorting its constitutional meaning.  

---

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) delivered a landmark judgment on the constitutional limits of restrictions on the right to peaceful assembly. The majority (Chief Justice Li, Mr Justice Chan, Mr Justice Ribeiro, and Sir Anthony Mason) held that the Commissioner of Police’s discretion to restrict assemblies for "public order (ordre public)" failed the constitutional "prescribed by law" requirement due to its vagueness, but the discretion for "public order" (in the narrow, law-and-order sense) was constitutional after severance. The judgment is notable for its meticulous analysis of legal certainty, proportionality, and the interplay between constitutional norms and statutory implementation. Below is a detailed breakdown of the legal principles:  

#### **(a) Constitutional Requirements for Restriction**  
The CFA reaffirmed that restrictions on fundamental rights (e.g., peaceful assembly) must satisfy two constitutional requirements:  
1. **"Prescribed by law"**: The law must be sufficiently precise to enable citizens to regulate their conduct, avoiding arbitrariness.  
2. **"Necessity in a democratic society"**: The restriction must be rationally connected to a legitimate purpose (national security, public safety, public order, protection of rights/freedoms) and no more than necessary to achieve it.  

The court emphasized that these requirements are derived from the *Basic Law* (Art. 39) and the ICCPR (Art. 21), which are incorporated into Hong Kong law via the BORO. Crucially, the legitimate purposes for restriction are **exhaustive**—no other purposes (e.g., "public convenience") may justify restrictions.  

#### **(b) The "Prescribed by Law" Requirement and the Vagueness of "Ordre Public"**  
The core issue centered on whether "public order (ordre public)" as used in the Ordinance satisfied the "prescribed by law" requirement. The court distinguished between:  
- **The constitutional concept of "ordre public"**: A broad, abstract norm (e.g., "the sum of rules ensuring society’s functioning") that is constitutionally acceptable but inherently imprecise.  
- **The statutory application of "ordre public"**: A discretionary power vested in the Commissioner of Police, which must be precise enough to avoid arbitrariness.  

The court held that while "ordre public" is a valid constitutional concept, its **statutory deployment** in the Ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. The term’s "boundaries beyond public order in the law and order sense cannot be clearly defined" (*Ng Kung Siu*), and its use in the Ordinance failed to provide adequate guidance for the Commissioner’s discretion. This violated the "prescribed by law" principle, as established in *Shum Kwok Sher* (where the court held that a law must be "formulated with sufficient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct").  

The court rejected the government’s proposed read-downs:  
- **Reading down to "serious disruption to the life of the community"** (from the UK *Public Order Act 1986*): The court deemed this unsupported by the Ordinance’s text or legislative intent.  
- **Reading down to ICCPR Art. 20** (prohibiting hate speech and war propaganda): The court noted that Art. 20 was not incorporated into the BORO, and even if it were, it could not justify narrowing "ordre public" in the Ordinance.  

#### **(c) Severance as the Appropriate Remedy**  
The court applied the severance test from *Ming Pao Newspapers Ltd v. Attorney-General*, which asks whether the valid part of a statute can "independently survive" if the invalid part is removed. The court concluded that:  
- "Public order" (in the narrow sense of maintaining public order and preventing disorder) is **sufficiently certain** to satisfy the "prescribed by law" requirement.  
- The legislature would have enacted the Ordinance with "public order" alone had it known the broader "ordre public" term was unconstitutional.  

Thus, the court **severed "public order" from "public order (ordre public)"** in ss. 14(1), 14(5), and 15(2) of the Ordinance, rendering the Commissioner’s discretion constitutional *only* for the narrower "public order" purpose. This was a **novel and significant application of severance** in Hong Kong constitutional law, avoiding wholesale invalidation of the Ordinance while preserving its core functionality.  

#### **(d) The Necessity Requirement and Proportionality**  
After severance, the court examined whether the Commissioner’s discretion for "public order" satisfied the necessity requirement. It held that it did, because:  
1. The discretion is **rationally connected** to the constitutional purpose of "public order (ordre public)" (as "public order" is a subset of "ordre public").  
2. The discretion is **no more than necessary** to achieve its purpose, due to:  
   - **Limited scope**: The Ordinance applies only to processions of >30 persons on public roads/parks.  
   - **Proportionality constraints**: The Commissioner must apply the proportionality test (i.e., assess whether a restriction is rationally connected to public order and no more than necessary).  
   - **Procedural safeguards**: The Commissioner must give adequate reasons, act within statutory time limits, and face appeal to the Appeal Board and judicial review.  

The court explicitly rejected the notion that "public order" (as a constitutional concept) could be interpreted to include broader societal interests (e.g., "aesthetic considerations" or "economic order"), emphasizing that the legitimate purposes are **exhaustive**.  

#### **(e) The Positive Duty of the Government**  
The court acknowledged the government’s **positive duty** to facilitate peaceful assemblies (citing the government’s own UN report), but clarified that this duty does not override the need for precise statutory terms. The notification requirement (s. 13A) was upheld as constitutional because it enables the government to fulfill this duty, but the Commissioner’s discretion to restrict assemblies for "ordre public" was invalid due to vagueness.  

#### **(f) Novel and Controversial Aspects of the Legal Reasoning**  
- **The "ordre public" distinction**: The court’s distinction between the constitutional concept of "ordre public" (broad and abstract) and its statutory application (requiring precision) is a **novel jurisprudential framework**. It avoids conflating constitutional norms with statutory implementation, a critical insight for human rights law.  
- **Severance over invalidation**: The court’s refusal to strike down the entire Ordinance (as the dissenting judge, Bokhary, advocated) reflects **judicial restraint** and a pragmatic approach to constitutional review. This aligns with the *Ming Pao* severance test but is a rare application in Hong Kong.  
- **Proportionality as a constitutional imperative**: The court reinforced that proportionality is not merely a judicial tool but a **constitutional requirement** for restrictions on fundamental rights. This elevates proportionality from a judicial doctrine to a foundational principle of constitutional law.  
- **Rejection of "hopeless vagueness" standard**: The court rejected the government’s argument that a law is constitutional unless "hopelessly vague," stressing that **greater precision is required** for restrictions on fundamental rights. This sets a higher bar for legislative drafting in rights-impacting statutes.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case  
1. **Strategic Constitutional Challenge by Activists**: The appellants deliberately organized an unauthorized procession to provoke a prosecution, thereby creating a vehicle to test the constitutionality of the *Public Order Ordinance*. This is a **rare and calculated use of the legal system** to advance a political cause, highlighting the intersection of activism and constitutional law.  

2. **The Court’s Historical and Comparative Jurisprudence**: The judgment is a **masterclass in comparative constitutional law**, citing cases from the European Court of Human Rights (*Malone v. UK*), German constitutional courts (*Brokdorf Atomic Power Station Case*), and the U.S. Supreme Court (*Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham*). The court’s reference to the *Sunday Times* "thalidomide" case to explain legal certainty underscores its commitment to global human rights standards.  

3. **The Dissent’s Radical Stance**: Mr Justice Bokhary’s dissenting judgment was **far more expansive** than the majority’s. He argued that *all* prior restraint powers (including notification requirements) were unconstitutional, a position that would have dismantled Hong Kong’s public assembly regime. The majority’s refusal to adopt this view reflects a **cautious balancing of rights and public order**.  

4. **The "Positive Duty" of the Government**: The court’s emphasis on the government’s **affirmative obligation** to facilitate peaceful assemblies (citing the government’s own UN report) is **unusual in common law jurisdictions**, where the state’s role is typically framed as negative (i.e., not interfering with rights). This elevates the state’s role from passive observer to active enabler of rights.  

5. **The Irony of the Conviction**: The appellants were convicted for **failing to notify the police**—a requirement the court upheld as constitutional—while the constitutional challenge centered on the *Commissioner’s discretion to restrict* assemblies. This highlights the **tension between procedural compliance and substantive rights**, a tension the court resolved by upholding the former while curbing the latter.  

6. **The Court’s Unwavering Focus on Legal Certainty**: The judgment’s **repetition of the principle that "certainty is the mother of repose"** (from *Colthirst v. Bejushin*) and its rejection of vague laws as "the mother of contention" is **philosophically resonant**. It frames legal certainty not as a technicality but as a **cornerstone of freedom**, a perspective that elevates the case beyond a narrow legal dispute.  

In summary, *Leung Kwok Hung v. HKSAR* is a **landmark case** that redefined the constitutional limits of public order restrictions in Hong Kong. Its meticulous analysis of legal certainty, proportionality, and severance has set a precedent for future human rights jurisprudence, while its strategic and historical dimensions make it a case of enduring significance.
