**Sec. 70401. Enhancement of employer-provided child care credit.**
This section increases the employer-provided child care credit rate from 25 percent to 40 percent, or 50 percent for eligible small businesses, while raising the maximum credit limit to $500,000 ($600,000 for small businesses). An eligible small business is defined as one meeting a gross receipts test based on a 5-taxable-year period rather than the previous 3-year period. The credit now explicitly covers services provided through contracts with intermediate entities and allows facilities jointly owned or operated by the taxpayer to qualify. These changes apply to amounts paid or incurred after December 31, 2025.

**Sec. 70402. Enhancement of adoption credit.**
This section makes the first $5,000 of the adoption credit refundable for taxpayers and adjusts the credit amounts for inflation starting after December 31, 2002, with a special inflation rule for the refundable portion using 2024 as the base year. It clarifies that the refundable portion is excluded from the carryforward calculation, ensuring it does not reduce the non-refundable credit available for future years. These amendments apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.

**Sec. 70403. Recognizing Indian tribal governments for purposes of determining whether a child has special needs for purposes of the adoption credit.**
This section amends the definition of "special needs" for the adoption credit to include determinations made by Indian tribal governments, not just State governments.

These changes apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024.

**Sec. 70404. Enhancement of the dependent care assistance program.**
This section increases the maximum amount of dependent care assistance that can be excluded from an employee's gross income from $5,000 ($2,500 for married filing separately) to $7,500 ($3,750 for married filing separately). This adjustment directly benefits employees receiving employer-provided dependent care assistance by allowing a larger portion of these benefits to remain tax-free. The amendment applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

**Sec. 70405. Enhancement of child and dependent care tax credit.**
This section increases the maximum applicable percentage for the child and dependent care tax credit to 50 percent, with a phase-out beginning at $15,000 of adjusted gross income (AGI) for single filers and $75,000 for joint filers. The credit percentage is reduced by 1 percentage point for every $2,000 (or fraction thereof) of AGI exceeding these thresholds, but it will not drop below 35 percent for the first phase-out range or 20 percent for the second. These changes apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

This section creates a new non-refundable tax credit of up to $1,700 for individuals who make qualified cash contributions to state-recognized scholarship granting organizations for eligible students with household incomes not exceeding 300 percent of the area median gross income. To qualify, the organization must spend at least 90 percent of its income on scholarships, serve at least 10 students who do not all attend the same school, and verify student income eligibility.

This provision applies to taxable years ending after December 31, 2026.

**Sec. 70412. Exclusion for employer payments of student loans.**
This section permanently extends the exclusion for employer payments of employee student loans, removing the previous expiration date of January 1, 2026, and allowing the $5,250 annual exclusion to continue indefinitely.

These changes apply to payments made after December 31, 2025.

**Sec. 70413. Additional expenses treated as qualified higher education expenses for purposes of 529 accounts.**
This section expands the definition of qualified higher education expenses for 529 plans to include tuition, curriculum, books, online materials, tutoring, standardized test fees, dual enrollment fees, and educational therapies for students with disabilities at elementary and secondary schools.

**Sec. 70414. Certain postsecondary credentialing expenses treated as qualified higher education expenses for purposes of 529 accounts.**
This section allows 529 accounts to be used tax-free for qualified postsecondary credentialing expenses, including tuition, fees, books, and testing fees for recognized industry credentials, apprenticeships, and professional licenses. A "recognized postsecondary credential program" is defined as one listed on state workforce lists, the Veterans Benefits Administration directory, or identified by the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of the Treasury. These changes apply to distributions made after the date of enactment.

**Sec. 70415. Modification of excise tax on investment income of certain private colleges and universities.**
This section modifies the 1.4 percent excise tax on net investment income for private colleges and universities with at least 3,000 tuition-paying students and a student-adjusted endowment of at least $500,000. The tax rate is tiered based on the student-adjusted endowment, rising to 4 percent for endowments between $750,000 and $2,000,000, and 8 percent for those exceeding $2,000,000. The definition of net investment income is expanded to include interest from student loans and federally-subsidized royalty income, and related organizations' assets are aggregated. These changes apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

**Sec. 70416. Expanding application of tax on excess compensation within tax-exempt organizations.**
This section expands the definition of a "covered employee" for the 21 percent excise tax on excess compensation to include any employee or former employee of a tax-exempt organization who was employed during any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2016. Previously, the definition was limited to employees who were covered employees in 2017 or later; this change ensures that former employees from the initial years of the tax are also subject to the rule. The amendment applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

**Sec. 70421. Permanent renewal and enhancement of opportunity zones.**
This section permanently renews Opportunity Zones by establishing a decennial determination date of July 1, 2026, and subsequent dates every 10 years, while repealing the special rule for Puerto Rico. It redefines low-income communities to include census tracts with poverty rates of at least 20 percent and median family income not exceeding 125 percent of the area median, and extends the designation period to 10 years from the certification date. The section introduces a new "qualified rural opportunity fund" category offering a 30 percent basis increase after 5 years and extends the 10-year holding period for tax-free appreciation to 30 years. New reporting requirements are established for funds and businesses, with penalties of up to $50,000 for large funds failing to comply.

These changes apply to buildings placed in service in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

**Sec. 70423. Permanent extension of new markets tax credit.**
This section permanently extends the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) allocation authority for each calendar year after 2019, removing the previous sunset date of 2025.

These amendments apply to calendar years beginning after December 31, 2025.

**Sec. 70424. Permanent and expanded reinstatement of partial deduction for charitable contributions of individuals who do not elect to itemize.**
This section permanently reinstates and expands the above-the-line deduction for charitable contributions for taxpayers who do not itemize, increasing the limit from $300 ($600 for joint filers) to $1,000 ($2,000 for joint filers). The provision removes the temporary expiration date, making the deduction available for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. This change directly benefits non-itemizing taxpayers by allowing a larger deduction for cash contributions to qualified charities.

**Sec. 70425. 0.5 percent floor on deduction of contributions made by individuals.**
This section imposes a 0.5 percent floor on the deduction for charitable contributions made by individuals, meaning contributions are only deductible to the extent they exceed 0.5 percent of the taxpayer's contribution base. It establishes a specific ordering rule for applying this floor, prioritizing contributions to certain organizations before others, and allows disallowed amounts to be carried forward only if the limitation is exceeded in the contribution year. This change applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

**Sec. 70426. 1-percent floor on deduction of charitable contributions made by corporations.**

This change applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

**Sec. 70427. Permanent increase in limitation on cover over of tax on distilled spirits.**

**Sec. 70428. Nonprofit community development activities in remote native villages.**
This section clarifies that activities related to fisheries in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, including harvesting, processing, and marketing, are considered substantially related to the exempt purpose of entities identified under the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act.

This section phases in an increase in the gain exclusion for qualified small business stock (QSBS) from 50 percent to 100 percent for stock held for at least 5 years, with a 75 percent exclusion for stock held for 4 years. It raises the per-issuer limitation for gain exclusion from $10 million to $15 million for stock acquired after the enactment date, while maintaining the $10 million limit for stock acquired before.

**Sec. 70436. Reduction of transfer and manufacturing taxes for certain devices.**
This section reduces the transfer and manufacturing excise taxes on firearms to $0 for all firearms except machineguns and destructive devices, which remain subject to a $200 tax.

This section allows taxpayers selling qualified farmland to a qualified farmer to elect to pay the resulting capital gains tax in four equal installments over four years.
