### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case involves Chan Ming Lok, who was convicted of possessing an offensive weapon, specifically a knife, in a public place in Hong Kong. The incident occurred on June 29, 2008, around 1:45 a.m., when Chan was walking in the vicinity of Cochrane Street, Central. A police officer observed Chan's suspicious behavior, including his movements and the way he carried his rucksack, and followed him until another officer intercepted Chan outside Nos. 9-11 Cochrane Street. When questioned, Chan admitted to carrying the knife for self-defense due to concerns about public order in Shenzhen, where he lived. The prosecution argued that Chan had no lawful authority or reasonable excuse for possessing the knife, and the magistrate convicted him of the offense, sentencing him to six months' imprisonment.

### 2. Arguments of the Two Parties

**Appellant's Argument (Mr. Wong):**
- The magistrate's conclusion that the knife was an offensive weapon was based on the incorrect interpretation of the Public Order Ordinance, specifically the category of "suitable for causing injury to the person."
- The appellant argues that the definition of an offensive weapon should be limited to the three categories suggested by the Court of Appeal in R v. Chong Ah Choi, namely: (a) made for causing injury, (b) adapted for causing injury, and (d) intended for causing injury.
- The magistrate's finding that the knife was an offensive weapon without specifying which category it fell under is problematic, as it may have been based on the now-disputed category (c).

**Respondent's Argument (Miss Lam):**
- The Secretary of Justice accepts that there are now only three categories of offensive weapons, and the prosecution would not argue for the survival of category (c).
- The magistrate's findings, despite not being ideally set out, were clear and based on the evidence presented. The magistrate's conclusion that the knife was an offensive weapon was based on its ability to cause injury and the appellant's intention to use it for self-defense.
- The magistrate's experience and familiarity with the nature of the offense support the conclusion that she correctly interpreted the law and the evidence.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The key legal principles in this case revolve around the definition and interpretation of "offensive weapon" under the Public Order Ordinance, Cap. 245, and the implications of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, Cap. 383.

**Definition of Offensive Weapon:**
- The Public Order Ordinance defines an offensive weapon as any article made, adapted for use, suitable for causing injury to the person, or intended by the person having it for such use.
- The Court of Appeal in R v. Chong Ah Choi suggested that the definition might need to be construed to exclude the category of "suitable for causing injury to the person" to comply with the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance.

**Categories of Offensive Weapons:**
- The Ordinance provides four categories of offensive weapons: (a) made for causing injury, (b) adapted for causing injury, (c) suitable for causing injury, and (d) intended for causing injury.
- The Secretary of Justice accepts that there are now only three categories: (a), (b), and (d), and the prosecution would not argue for the survival of category (c).

**Credibility of Witnesses and Intent:**
- The magistrate found the police witnesses to be honest and credible, and their evidence was accepted.
- The appellant's admission that he carried the knife for self-defense in Shenzhen indicates an intention to use it as a weapon, even if for self-defense.

**Reasonable Excuse and Lawful Authority:**
- The appellant's claim of self-defense does not amount to a reasonable excuse for possession of an offensive weapon in Hong Kong, especially when there was no evidence of imminent danger.
- The appellant's movements and behavior, while suspicious, did not provide a lawful authority or reasonable excuse for carrying the knife.

**Sentence:**
- The mandatory sentence for the offense is imprisonment of not more than three years.
- The appeal court reduced the sentence from six months to four months, considering the appellant's lack of prior convictions and the nature of the knife.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case

**Legal Uncertainty:**
- The case highlights the legal uncertainty surrounding the definition of "offensive weapon" in the Public Order Ordinance, particularly the category of "suitable for causing injury to the person."
- The fact that the Ordinance has not been amended despite the Court of Appeal's comments over 14 years ago is surprising and potentially problematic.

**Interpretation of Self-Defense:**
- The case demonstrates the narrow interpretation of self-defense in the context of possessing an offensive weapon. Even if the appellant intended to use the knife for self-defense, it was not considered a reasonable excuse for possession in Hong Kong.

**Sentence Reduction:**
- The appeal court's decision to reduce the sentence from six months to four months, despite the mandatory sentence provision, reflects a nuanced approach to sentencing based on the specific circumstances of the case.

**Magistrate's Findings:**
- The magistrate's findings, while generally clear, were criticized for not explicitly stating which category of offensive weapon the knife fell under. This ambiguity raises questions about the clarity and thoroughness of the judicial process.

**Public Order and Safety:**
- The case underscores the importance of public order and safety in Hong Kong, emphasizing that the law views the carrying of offensive weapons very seriously, even for self-defense. This reflects the broader societal values and priorities in maintaining a safe environment. [end of text]
