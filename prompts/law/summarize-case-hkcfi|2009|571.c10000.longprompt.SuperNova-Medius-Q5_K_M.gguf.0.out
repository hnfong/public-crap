### 1. Facts of the Case

The case of HKSAR v. CHAN MING LOK [2009] HKCFI 571 involves an appeal against the conviction and sentence of the appellant for the offence of possession of an offensive weapon, contrary to section 33(1) of the Public Order Ordinance, Cap. 245. The incident occurred on 29 June 2008 in a public place outside Nos. 9-11 Cochrane Street, Central, Hong Kong.

The appellant was seen by a police officer, PC34497, walking suspiciously late at night, stopping frequently, and looking around. The officer followed the appellant and informed his colleague, who eventually intercepted the appellant. When questioned, the appellant admitted to carrying a knife for self-defence, as he was afraid of being robbed when returning to Shenzhen late at night. The knife was found to be sharp and pointed, capable of causing injury.

The magistrate found that the knife was an offensive weapon and that the appellant had no lawful authority or reasonable excuse for possessing it. The appellant was convicted and sentenced to 6 months' imprisonment.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**Appellant's Argument (Mr Wong):**
- The magistrate's conclusion that the knife was an offensive weapon was based on the incorrect interpretation of the Public Order Ordinance. Specifically, the magistrate may have relied on the now potentially repealed category (c) of "suitable for causing injury to the person."
- The appellant's intention to use the knife for self-defence in Shenzhen, rather than for any offensive purpose in Hong Kong, should have been considered a reasonable excuse for possession.
- The magistrate's findings were not clearly articulated, and there is a possibility that she concluded the knife was an offensive weapon based on the incorrect category (c).

**Respondent's Argument (Miss Lam):**
- The Secretary of Justice accepted that there are now only three categories of offensive weapons (a), (b), and (d), and category (c) is no longer applicable.
- The magistrate's findings, despite not being ideally set out, were clear and based on the appellant's admission that he intended to use the knife as a weapon, even if for self-defence.
- The magistrate's experience and familiarity with the nature of the offence should be taken into account, and her conclusion that the knife was an offensive weapon was based on the appellant's admission and the knife's capability to cause injury.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**Offensive Weapon Definition:**
The Public Order Ordinance defines an offensive weapon as any article made, adapted for use, suitable for causing injury to the person, or intended by the person having it for such use. However, due to the potential conflict with the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, the category "suitable for causing injury to the person" (category (c)) may no longer be applicable. The remaining categories are:
- (a) an article made for causing injury to the person;
- (b) an article adapted for use for causing injury to the person;
- (d) an article intended by the person having it for use for causing injury to the person.

**Conviction and Sentence:**
- The magistrate's conclusion that the knife was an offensive weapon was based on the appellant's admission that he intended to use it as a weapon, even if for self-defence. This admission, coupled with the knife's capability to cause injury, satisfied the criteria for an offensive weapon under category (d).
- The appellant's argument that he intended to use the knife for self-defence in Shenzhen and not for any offensive purpose in Hong Kong did not provide a reasonable excuse for possession. The law views the carrying of such weapons very seriously, even if intended for self-defence.
- The appeal against conviction was dismissed, but the sentence was reduced from 6 months to 4 months' imprisonment, considering the appellant's lack of prior convictions and the relatively small size of the knife.

**Key Points:**
- The case highlights the importance of clear articulation of findings in judicial decisions, especially when dealing with potentially repealed categories of law.
- The court's decision underscores the strict interpretation of the Public Order Ordinance and the serious nature of carrying offensive weapons, even for self-defence.
- The reduction in sentence reflects a balance between the seriousness of the offence and the appellant's lack of prior convictions and the specific circumstances of the case. 

This case provides a detailed examination of the legal principles surrounding the possession of offensive weapons and the interpretation of the Public Order Ordinance in light of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance. It also emphasizes the importance of clear judicial reasoning and the strict application of the law in such cases. [end of text]
