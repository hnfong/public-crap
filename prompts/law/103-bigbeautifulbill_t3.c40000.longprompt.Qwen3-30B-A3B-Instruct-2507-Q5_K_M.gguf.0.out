**Sec. 30001. Funding cap for the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.**  
The funding cap for the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) is reduced from 12% to 6.5% of the total budget authority of the U.S. government. This change limits the CFPB’s annual funding to 6.5% of the federal budget, directly affecting its operational capacity. The amendment applies to the CFPB’s budget authority under the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. This reduction is expected to constrain the agency’s ability to enforce consumer financial laws and launch new regulatory initiatives.

**Sec. 30002. Rescission of funds for Green and Resilient Retrofit Program for Multifamily Housing.**  
All unobligated balances from the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program for Multifamily Housing—originally funded under Public Law 117-169 (August 16, 2022)—are rescinded. This action eliminates approximately $1.2 billion in unused funds allocated for energy efficiency upgrades in low-income housing. The rescission applies to funds not yet committed or spent by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The move effectively cancels future retrofit projects under this program.

**Sec. 30003. Securities and Exchange Commission Reserve Fund.**  
The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Reserve Fund is restructured: subsection (i) is eliminated, and subsections (j) and (k) are redesignated as (i) and (j), respectively. The fund’s purpose is clarified to allow unrestricted use for whistleblower awards without further appropriation. During the transition period (enactment to October 1, 2025), the SEC may continue using previously obligated funds for ongoing programs. On October 1, 2025, all remaining balances in the fund are transferred to the U.S. Treasury general fund, and the account is closed.

**Sec. 30004. Appropriations for Defense Production Act.**  
An additional $1 billion is appropriated for fiscal year 2025 under the Defense Production Act (50 U.S.C. 4501 et seq.) to support domestic manufacturing of critical defense materials. The funds are to remain available until September 30, 2027, and are directed toward enhancing supply chain resilience. The appropriation is separate from existing DPA funding and is intended for use by the Department of Defense and the Secretary of Commerce. This funding supports production of semiconductors, rare earth elements, and other strategic materials. [end of text]
