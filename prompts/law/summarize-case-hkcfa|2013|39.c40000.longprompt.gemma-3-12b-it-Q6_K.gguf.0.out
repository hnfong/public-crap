## 1. Summary of Facts

The case of *W v. The Registrar of Marriages* concerns a post-operative male-to-female transsexual person ("W") who wishes to marry her male partner in Hong Kong. W has undergone extensive medical treatment, including surgery, to transition to a female identity. She has been issued a new identity card reflecting her female gender and has received a letter from the Hospital Authority confirming her gender change. Despite this, the Registrar of Marriages refused to allow the marriage, arguing that under the Marriage Ordinance and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance, W does not qualify as a "woman" for the purposes of marriage. W challenged this decision through judicial review, arguing she *should* be legally recognized as a woman for marriage purposes. The case progressed through the lower courts, initially failing at first instance and in the Court of Appeal, before being granted leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal.

## 2. Summary of Arguments

**Appellant (W):** W's primary argument was that she *is* a woman for the purposes of marriage under Hong Kong law. She emphasized that she has undergone extensive medical procedures to align her physical appearance and identity with her female gender. Her counsel, Lord Pannick QC, argued that the case was not about legalizing same-sex marriage, but rather about recognizing a transsexual person's right to marry a person of the opposite sex.  She argued that the Registrar's interpretation of "woman" was overly restrictive and failed to account for the realities of transsexualism and the advancements in medical science. She also pointed to international trends and the recognition of transsexuals' right to marry in many other jurisdictions.

**Respondent (Registrar of Marriages):** The Registrar argued that the existing legislation, specifically sections 21 and 40 of the Marriage Ordinance and section 20(1)(d) of the Matrimonial Causes Ordinance, clearly define marriage as a union between a man and a woman, based on biological sex at birth. The Registrar contended that the words "woman" and "female" should be interpreted according to their ordinary meaning and that sex reassignment surgery does not alter a person's fundamental biological sex. The Registrar also raised concerns about the potential ramifications of extending the definition of "woman" to include transsexuals, and suggested that any changes should be made through legislative action rather than judicial interpretation.



## 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The Court of Final Appeal's decision in *W v. The Registrar of Marriages* establishes several significant legal principles concerning the intersection of transgender rights, marriage law, and constitutional rights. The ratio decidendi can be broken down into the following key points:

**1. Statutory Construction and the Corbett Approach:** The Court initially agreed with the lower courts that, as a matter of statutory construction, the Registrarâ€™s interpretation of the Marriage Ordinance and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance was correct. The Court acknowledged that the legislation, particularly section 20(1)(d) of the Matrimonial Causes Ordinance, was enacted to reflect the *Corbett v Corbett* decision (1971), which held that
