Okay, here's a breakdown of the *W v. The Registrar of Marriages* case, addressing your requested tasks.

**1. Summary of Facts**

The case involves W, a post-operative male-to-female transsexual person who, after undergoing sex reassignment surgery, wishes to marry her male partner in Hong Kong. The Registrar of Marriages refused to authorize the marriage, arguing that under the Marriage Ordinance and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance, W does not qualify as a "woman" for the purposes of marriage. W challenged this decision through judicial review, arguing that she *should* be legally recognized as a woman. The High Court and Court of Appeal both dismissed her challenge, leading her to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal. The core issue is whether Hong Kong law, specifically its definitions of "man" and "woman" in marriage legislation, is compatible with the constitutional rights of transsexual individuals.

**2. Summary of Arguments**

*   **Appellant (W):** W's argument centered on the assertion that she *is* a woman, legally and socially, following her sex reassignment surgery. She argued that denying her the right to marry a man is discriminatory and violates her constitutional rights to marry (Article 37 of the Basic Law) and privacy (Article 14 of the Bill of Rights). She emphasized that she has undergone extensive medical procedures, lives as a woman, and is recognized as such for many other legal purposes (e.g., identity card, passport). She did *not* argue for the legalization of same-sex marriage, but rather that she, as a woman, should be able to marry a man.
*   **Registrar of Marriages (Respondent):** The Registrar argued that the existing legislation (Marriage Ordinance and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance) defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman, based on biological sex at birth. The Registrar maintained that sex reassignment surgery does not alter a person's fundamental biological sex and that the legislation should be interpreted literally. The Registrar also raised concerns about the potential ramifications of recognizing transsexuals' acquired gender for marriage, suggesting that it would require a comprehensive review of the law and potentially disrupt established legal principles.

**3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The Court of Final Appeal's judgment establishes a complex and evolving legal framework concerning the rights of transsexual individuals in the context of marriage. Here's a detailed breakdown of the key principles:

*   **Statutory Interpretation & the Corbett Precedent:** The Court initially agreed with the lower courts that, based on a traditional construction of the Marriage Ordinance and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance, the Registrar's interpretation was correct. The Court acknowledged the historical precedent of *Corbett v Corbett* [1971] P 83, which established that biological sex at birth, determined by chromosomal, gonadal, and genital factors, is the defining factor for determining marital eligibility
