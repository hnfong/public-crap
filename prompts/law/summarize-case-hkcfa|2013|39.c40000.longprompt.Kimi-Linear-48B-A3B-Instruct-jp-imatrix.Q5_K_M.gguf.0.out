### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts

The case concerns **W**, a post-operative male-to-female transsexual who wishes to marry her male partner in Hong Kong. Despite undergoing full sex reassignment surgery (SRS) and obtaining a new identity card and passport recognizing her as female, the **Registrar of Marriages** refused to allow the marriage, citing the **Marriage Ordinance (Cap. 181)** and **Matrimonial Causes Ordinance (Cap. 179)**, which define marriage as between "one man and one woman" and require the parties to be "respectively male and female." W challenged this decision, arguing that the statutes should be interpreted to include post-operative transsexuals as "women" for the purposes of marriage. The lower courts rejected her claim, leading to an appeal to the **Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong (HKCFA)**.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

- **Appellant (W)**:
  - Argued that the statutes should be interpreted to include post-operative transsexuals as "women" for marriage purposes.
  - Relied on **Article 37 of the Basic Law** (right to marry) and **Article 19(2) of the Bill of Rights** (right of men and women to marry) to argue that the current interpretation violates her constitutional rights.
  - Contended that the **Corbett v Corbett** approach (biological criteria only) is outdated and inconsistent with modern medical and social understanding of transsexualism.

- **Respondent (Registrar of Marriages)**:
  - Argued that the statutes unambiguously require biological sex at birth to determine marital capacity.
  - Submitted that the **Corbett** approach remains valid and that legislative change, not judicial reinterpretation, is needed.
  - Claimed that recognizing W’s marriage would have far-reaching social and legal consequences, which should be addressed by the legislature, not the courts.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The HKCFA’s judgment is a comprehensive analysis of statutory interpretation, constitutional rights, and the evolving legal status of transsexuals. Key legal principles include:

#### **A. Statutory Interpretation**
- **Corbett v Corbett (1971)**: The court reaffirmed that for marriage purposes, "woman" and "man" refer to biological sex at birth, determined by chromosomal, gonadal, and genital criteria. This approach was adopted in Hong Kong via **Matrimonial Causes Ordinance (Cap. 179) s.20(1)(d)** and **Marriage Ordinance (Cap. 181) s.40**.
- **Legislative Intent**: The court found that the Hong Kong legislature implicitly adopted the **Corbett** criteria when enacting the statutes, reflecting the UK’s **Nullity of Marriage Act 1971**.
- **"Always Speaking" Doctrine**: While statutes are presumed to evolve, the court declined to extend "woman" to include post-operative transsexuals, citing the lack of clear legislative intent or societal consensus in Hong Kong.

#### **B. Constitutional Rights**
- **Article 37 (Basic Law) & Article 19(2) (Bill of Rights)**: The court held that these provisions guarantee the right to marry but do not compel recognition of a transsexual’s acquired gender for marriage purposes. The right to marry is not absolute and can be subject to reasonable legal restrictions.
- **Procreation & Marriage**: The court rejected the argument that procreation is an essential element of marriage, noting that many marriages are childless or involve couples who cannot biologically procreate. However, it declined to extend marriage rights to post-operative transsexuals based on this reasoning alone.
- **Remedial Interpretation**: The court refused to reinterpret the statutes to include transsexuals, stating that such a change would constitute judicial lawmaking rather than interpretation. Instead, it emphasized that legislative action is required.

#### **C. Transsexual Rights & Social Context**
- **Medical and Social Evolution**: The court acknowledged advances in transsexual healthcare and shifting societal attitudes but concluded that these do not yet justify a constitutional reinterpretation of marriage laws in Hong Kong.
- **Margin of Appreciation**: The court noted that the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) initially deferred to national discretion in transsexual marriage cases (e.g., **Rees, Cossey, Sheffield**) but later reversed course in **Goodwin v UK (2002)**, recognizing that excluding post-operative transsexuals from marriage violates their rights. However, the HKCFA distinguished Hong Kong’s context, citing insufficient local consensus.

#### **D. Relief & Future Legislation**
- The court granted a **declaration of unconstitutionality** but suspended its effect for 12 months to allow the legislature to address the issue. It suggested that a **gender recognition framework** (like the UK’s **Gender Recognition Act 2004**) could provide a clearer path forward.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

- **Majority vs. Dissent**: The case was decided by a **majority (3-1)**, with **Mr Justice Chan PJ dissenting**. His dissent emphasized the need for legislative action and questioned whether the constitutional right to marry should be extended to transsexuals, reflecting a more conservative approach.
- **International Contrast**: The court noted that **Mainland China** (where Hong Kong is part of China) recognizes post-operative transsexuals’ marriages, highlighting a divergence in legal approaches within the same jurisdiction.
- **Legislative Gap**: The judgment underscores Hong Kong’s lack of specific legislation for transsexual rights, forcing the court to grapple with outdated statutes in a rapidly evolving social landscape.
- **Human Rights Framing**: The case is notable for its detailed engagement with **human rights principles**, particularly the tension between individual rights and societal norms, as seen in the debate over whether marriage is a "strong right" (per Lord Bingham) or a traditional institution.

### Conclusion

The **W v Registrar of Marriages** case is a landmark decision that balances statutory interpretation with constitutional rights, ultimately deferring to the legislature to resolve the legal status of post-operative transsexuals. While the court recognized the hardships faced by transsexuals, it concluded that the current laws, rooted in the **Corbett** approach, do not violate constitutional rights—at least in the absence of clear legislative intent or societal consensus in Hong Kong. The case remains a pivotal moment in Hong Kong’s evolving discourse on gender, marriage, and human rights. [end of text]
