## Summary of *Secretary for Justice v. Chan Chi Wan Stephen* [2017] HKCFA 15

### 1. Facts of the Case

Stephen Chan Chi Wan, a General Manager at Television Broadcasts Ltd (TVB), hosted a popular talk show called “Be My Guest.” He was paid by Olympian City (OC) through an intermediary, Idea Empire Advertising & Production Company Limited (IEAP), to host a live segment of the show as part of a New Year’s Eve Countdown event sponsored by OC. Chan did not seek permission from TVB for this external work, despite a contractual obligation to do so.  TVB was aware Chan would be participating in the event, as it was broadcast on their channel.  The prosecution charged Chan and the intermediary, Tseng Pei Kun (director of IEAP), with offences under section 9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO), alleging a corrupt transaction involving an agent (Chan) accepting an advantage (the payment) for an act relating to his principal’s (TVB’s) affairs. The initial trial acquitted them, but the Court of Appeal overturned this, directing a conviction on the conspiracy charge. This appeal concerned the correct interpretation of section 9 and the application of the “reasonable excuse” defence.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**The Prosecution:** Argued that Chan’s appearance on the “Be My Guest” segment, even though beneficial to TVB, was still an act “in relation to” TVB’s affairs or business, triggering section 9. They contended that the fact Chan was already a popular figure due to his TVB show didn’t negate the connection. They downplayed the need to prove a corrupt intent, emphasizing the act itself.  They also argued the reasonable excuse defence did not apply.

**The Defence (Chan and Tseng):**  Argued that Chan’s appearance was a personal engagement, not undertaken in his capacity as a TVB employee, and therefore not “in relation to” TVB’s affairs. They emphasized that the payment was for his celebrity status, not for leveraging his position at TVB. They asserted that the act was not aimed at influencing TVB’s business and that Chan had a reasonable excuse, as TVB was aware of and did not object to his participation. They also argued that the Court of Appeal erred in finding guilt solely on the conspiracy charge without properly considering the reasonable excuse defence.  They further contended that the prosecution failed to prove the necessary *mens rea* (corrupt intent) for the offence.



### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

This case provides a detailed examination of section 9 of the POBO, particularly concerning the interpretation of “in relation to his principal’s affairs or business” and the defence of “reasonable excuse.” The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) clarified several key principles:

**1. Scope of Section 9 and the “In Relation To” Requirement:** Section 9 is designed to address corrupt transactions between third parties and agents, aiming to protect the integrity of the agency relationship. The phrase “in relation to his principal’s affairs or business” is a restrictive element, not merely a statement of factual connection.  It requires that the agent’s act or forbearance be *aimed at* and *intended to influence or affect* the principal’s affairs.  This isn’t simply about whether the principal is incidentally involved; it’s about whether the agent’s action was directed towards the principal’s interests.  The CFA rejected a broad interpretation that any connection to the principal’s business, even a beneficial one, would suffice.

**2.  The Importance of *Mens Rea*:** While section 9 doesn’t explicitly require “corrupt intent” (having removed the word “corruptly” from earlier legislation), the CFA emphasized that the offence requires proof of a mental element.  For an agent accepting an advantage, the prosecution must prove the agent *knew or believed* the advantage was offered as an inducement or reward for an act relating to the principal’s affairs.  For a third party offering an advantage, the prosecution must prove the offeror *intended* the advantage would be accepted for such a purpose.  This mental element is crucial in establishing the corrupt nature of the transaction.

**3.  Adverse Impact Not Necessarily Required, But Integrity is Key:** The CFA clarified that the act need not be *detrimental* to the principal’s interests to fall within section 9. However, the act must undermine the integrity of the agency relationship.  The act must be one that a loyal agent *should not* be undertaking, even if it happens to benefit the principal.  The focus is on the potential for conflict of interest and the erosion of trust.  The CFA emphasized that the offence targets situations where the agent is being induced to act in a way that deviates from their normal duties.

**4.  The Defence of “Reasonable Excuse”:** The CFA acknowledged that “reasonable excuse” is a defence, shifting the burden to the accused to prove it.  The assessment of a reasonable excuse is objective, considering the circumstances and the purpose of the legislation.  The CFA did not definitively rule on whether the reverse onus violated the presumption of innocence, but noted the issue.  The CFA found that the Court of Appeal erred in not properly considering the reasonable excuse defence in the context of the facts.

**5.  Distinction from Public Servant Offences:** The CFA distinguished section 9 (dealing with agents) from section 4 (dealing with public servants).  Section 4 focuses on the agent acting *in their capacity* as a public servant, while section 9 requires a broader connection to the principal’s affairs, but still requires the act to be aimed at influencing those affairs.

**Novel and Controversial Points:**

*   **The Narrow Interpretation of “In Relation To”:** The CFA’s insistence on the “aimed at” and “intended to influence” requirement is a relatively narrow interpretation of the phrase, potentially limiting the scope of section 9. This could make it harder to prosecute cases where the connection between the agent’s act and the principal’s affairs is less direct.
*   **The Absence of a Clear “Adverse Impact” Requirement:** While the CFA rejected the need for *direct* harm to the principal, the emphasis on undermining the integrity of the agency relationship introduces a degree of subjectivity. Determining what constitutes a sufficient breach of trust could be challenging in practice.
*   **The Role of *Mens Rea*:** The CFA’s emphasis on the mental element, while consistent with general criminal law principles, is a departure from a purely objective approach that some might have expected given the legislative history of removing the word “corruptly.”
*   **The Reasonable Excuse Defence:** The application of the reasonable excuse defence remains somewhat unclear, particularly in situations where the principal is aware of the agent’s outside activities but doesn’t explicitly consent.



In conclusion, *Secretary for Justice v. Chan Chi Wan Stephen* provides a nuanced and detailed interpretation of section 9 of the POBO, emphasizing the importance of a direct connection between the agent’s act and the principal’s affairs, the need for a mental element, and the significance of protecting the integrity of the agency relationship. The case clarifies the scope of the offence and provides guidance for future prosecutions under this provision.  The differing judgments highlight the complexities of balancing the need to combat corruption with the protection of individual rights and the principles of criminal law. [end of text]
