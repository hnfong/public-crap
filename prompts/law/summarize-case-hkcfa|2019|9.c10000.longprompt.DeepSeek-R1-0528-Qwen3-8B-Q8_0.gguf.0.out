Hmm, the user has provided a legal case and asked for a summary of four specific tasks. This appears to be a case from Hong Kong involving computer misuse charges against four individuals. The user wants me to summarize the facts, arguments of both parties, legal principles, and any striking aspects of this case.

Let me analyze this case carefully. It's Secretary for Justice v Cheng Ka Yee and others [2019] HKCFA 9. The case revolves around whether using one's own computer to obtain information with dishonest intent constitutes a crime under Section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance.

The factual background involves four respondents who were teachers or school staff. They used their personal devices (smartphones) or a school computer to take photographs or documents of interview questions for competitive admission. The first three respondents were teachers at a Christian Chinese primary school, and the fourth was a teacher from another school who was a classmate of the second respondent. They were charged under Section 161(1)(c) for obtaining access to computers with a view to dishonest gain.

For the arguments, I need to distinguish between the prosecution (represented by the Secretary for Justice) and the respondents (represented by defense lawyers). The prosecution argued that the section should be broadly interpreted to cover any dishonest use of computers, while the defense argued that the section specifically requires access to someone else's computer.

The legal principles section is particularly detailed. I should focus on the novel aspects - the court's analysis of whether "obtain access to a computer" includes using one's own computer, the textual analysis of the statute, the legislative history showing the section was intended for preparatory offenses, and the policy considerations about distinguishing between one's own computer and others'.

The striking aspect of this case is how it demonstrates the tension between technological advancement and legal interpretation. The court had to determine if existing laws could adequately address new forms of computer misuse that weren't foreseeable when the laws were written.

I should structure my response with clear sections for each task, being thorough in the legal principles part as requested. I'll make sure to highlight the novel aspects of the case's reasoning and its significance in Hong Kong's legal landscape.

Okay, here is the summary of the case based on the provided text:

1.  **Facts:** Four individuals (three primary school teachers from the Church of Christ in China Heep Woh Primary School and a fourth teacher from another school) were involved in transmitting confidential interview questions for competitive admission to the first three appellants' school. The first respondent copied the questions using her phone. The second respondent copied the questions using her phone and sent them. The third respondent used the school's computer to type the questions into a Word document and sent copies via email and phone. The fourth respondent copied the questions using her phone and sent them. All were charged under Section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance for obtaining access to a computer (their phones or the school computer) with a view to dishonest gain for another. The primary school teachers were acquitted by a Magistrate, who found reasonable doubt on dishonest intent and confidentiality. The Secretary for Justice appealed, leading through several levels to the Court of Final Appeal (CFA), which allowed the appeal on the grounds of legal importance regarding the scope of the offense.

2.  **Arguments of the Parties:**
    *   **Prosecution (Appellant - Secretary for Justice):** Argued that the offense under s 161(1)(c) should be broadly interpreted to cover any dishonest use of a computer, including their own. They claimed that the legislative intent was to combat computer misuse, and the examples given (like using private email accounts, social networking stalking, etc.) clearly fell within the section's language. They emphasized the beneficial public policy of a wider interpretation to cover modern technological offenses.
    *   **Respondents (Defence):** Argued that the specific wording of s 161(1)(c) requires access to *another person's* computer. They contended that using one's own computer does not constitute "dishonest gain" in the same way as accessing someone else's restricted information, and that the term "dishonest gain" implies a breach of trust or restriction imposed by the owner of the accessed computer. They relied on the text, context (amendments to other computer-related statutes targeting external access), and purpose (to create preparatory offenses for substantive crimes) of the statute.

3.  **Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi):**
    *   **Proper Construction:** The Court emphasized the need for proper statutory interpretation, starting from the plain text of the statute (s 161(1)(c)), its context (location in the Crimes Ordinance, Part XIII; legislative history; purpose), and its purpose. The core principle was that interpretation must be based on the *actual* meaning intended by the legislature, not on perceived beneficial policy outcomes.
    *   **Meaning of "Obtain Access":** The phrase "obtain access to a computer" was analyzed. The word "obtain" implies gaining entry to something previously unavailable. The ordinary meaning of "access" relates to the use or retrieval of stored data or programs. Crucially, the language suggests that access is typically gained *to* a computer containing data or programs, rather than using one's own computer system.
    *   **Scope of Actus Reus:** The central legal question was whether "obtaining access to a computer" includes using one's own computer. The Court concluded that the text of s 161(1)(c) does not naturally extend to using one's own device. The inclusion of "dishonest gain" implies a gain derived from *accessing information* that belongs to or is controlled by another person, which is not
