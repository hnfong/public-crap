Okay, I need to tackle this case summary for the user. Let me start by understanding the case. It's about Stephen Chan and Tseng Pei Kun charged under Hong Kong's Prevention of Bribery Ordinance for conspiring to accept an advantage. The key event is Chan appearing on a TV show as part of a New Year's Eve Countdown, which was sponsored by a mall. The issue revolves around whether Chan's participation was "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" under section 9 of the Ordinance.

First, I'll summarize the facts. Chan was employed by TVB and hosted a show called "Be My Guest." He was approached by Tseng, who acted as his agent for outside engagements, to appear on a live segment of the Countdown show. OC, the mall sponsor, paid IEAP (Tseng's company) for this, and IEAP paid Chan. The trial judge acquitted them, but the Court of Appeal reversed that, leading to a case stated to the Court of Final Appeal. The appeal focused on the mens rea and the interpretation of "in relation to principal's affairs or business."

Next, the arguments. The prosecution argued that Chan's act was aimed at TVB's business, affecting their interests. The defense claimed it was moonlighting and not related to TVB's affairs. The Court of Appeal initially found it related, but the CFA ultimately quashed the convictions, emphasizing that the act must be adverse to the principal's interests.

For the legal principles, the ratio decidendi centers on the interpretation of section 9. The CFA held that the agent's act must be aimed at and intended to influence or affect the principal's affairs, and it must be adverse. They rejected the broader interpretation that any act related to the principal's business suffices. This is novel because it introduces the requirement of adverse impact, which wasn't explicitly stated before but inferred from the Ordinance's purpose.

Lastly, what's striking about the case? The CFA's unanimous decision to quash the convictions despite the Court of Appeal's contrary view highlights the importance of the mens rea and the specific intent to influence the principal's affairs. It also underscores the narrow interpretation of section 9, which might have broader implications for similar cases.

### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case involves Stephen Chan Chi Wan, a former General Manager (Broadcasting) at Television Broadcasts Ltd (TVB), and Tseng Pei Kun, the sole director and shareholder of Idea Empire Advertising & Production Company Limited (IEAP). Chan was employed by TVB under a contract that required him to seek approval for outside work. Tseng acted as Chan’s agent for such engagements. In 2009, Olympian City (OC), a shopping mall, sponsored a New Year’s Eve Countdown show produced by TVB. OC and TVB agreed to include a live segment of Chan’s popular talk show, “Be My Guest,” in the Countdown event. OC approached Tseng via IEAP to secure Chan’s participation, agreeing to pay IEAP $160,000, with IEAP retaining $28,000 and paying Chan $112,000 and Lai Yiu Cheung $20,000. Chan did not seek TVB’s permission for this appearance, though he had a contractual obligation to do so. The show aired, and Chan received the payment. Chan and Tseng were charged with conspiring to accept an advantage under section 9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO), which prohibits corrupt transactions involving agents. The trial judge acquitted them, but the Court of Appeal reversed the decision, leading to a case stated to the Court of Final Appeal (CFA). The CFA ultimately quashed the convictions, emphasizing the need for the agent’s act to be adverse to the principal’s interests and aimed at influencing or affecting the principal’s affairs.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties

**Prosecution’s Argument:**  
The prosecution argued that Chan’s participation in the Countdown show was an act “in relation to his principal’s affairs or business” under section 9 of the POBO. They contended that TVB’s Countdown event was a significant business venture, and Chan’s appearance as part of the show was intended to boost audience ratings and promote TVB’s interests. The prosecution emphasized that OC’s sponsorship of the show and payment to IEAP were designed to secure Chan’s involvement, which would influence TVB’s business by enhancing the event’s appeal. They relied on the Court of Appeal’s interpretation that any act related to the principal’s business, even if beneficial, could fall within section 9 if it involved an advantage offered without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.

**Defense’s Argument:**  
The defense argued that Chan’s participation was purely a personal or celebrity endeavor and not aimed at influencing TVB’s business. They highlighted that Chan was not required to perform in front of cameras as part of his role at TVB and that his appearance on the Countdown show was a form of moonlighting. The defense claimed that Chan had a reasonable excuse for accepting the payment, as TVB implicitly consented to his participation by allowing the show to be part of the Countdown event. They also argued that the prosecution failed to prove that Chan’s act was intended to adversely affect TVB’s interests, as the show was beneficial to TVB and did not conflict with its business.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) of the Case

The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) delivered a unanimous judgment quashing the convictions of Chan and Tseng, emphasizing several key legal principles derived from the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO) and its interpretation:

#### **Interpretation of Section 9: "In Relation to Principal’s Affairs or Business"**
The CFA held that for an act to fall within section 9 of the POBO, it must be **aimed at and intended to influence or affect the principal’s affairs or business**. This requirement was derived from the Privy Council’s decision in *Commissioner of the ICAC v Ch’ng Poh*, where it was clarified that the agent’s act must be intended to influence or affect the principal’s affairs. The CFA rejected the broader interpretation advanced by the Court of Appeal, which had equated “in relation to” with any act connected to the principal’s business, even if beneficial. The CFA emphasized that the phrase must be construed restrictively to ensure that only acts that undermine the integrity of the agency relationship are criminalized.

#### **Requirement of Adverse Impact**
A novel and controversial aspect of the CFA’s decision was the introduction of the **requirement that the agent’s act must be adverse to the principal’s interests**. The CFA held that section 9 targets conduct that subverts the trust and loyalty between principal and agent, such as secret commissions or inducements that compromise the agent’s fiduciary duties. This interpretation was grounded in the mischief of the Ordinance, which aims to prevent corruption in private sector dealings. The CFA distinguished between acts that are merely beneficial to the principal (e.g., boosting audience ratings) and those that involve a breach of trust or loyalty. This requirement of adverse impact was not explicitly stated in the POBO but was inferred from its legislative purpose and the need to prevent corrupt transactions that undermine agency relationships.

#### **Mens Rea and Intent**
The CFA reaffirmed that section 9 requires proof of **mens rea**, including the agent’s knowledge or belief that the advantage was provided as an inducement or reward for an act aimed at influencing the principal’s affairs. In soliciting or accepting cases, the prosecution must prove that the accused knew or believed the advantage was intended to influence or affect the principal’s business. The CFA emphasized that the mens rea element is critical to distinguishing between lawful and corrupt transactions, even if the act itself appears neutral or beneficial.

#### **Reasonable Excuse Defense**
The CFA upheld the defense of **reasonable excuse**, noting that it is broader in scope than lawful authority or permission under section 9(4) and (5). The defense was available if the agent honestly believed that the principal consented to the act or that the advantage was not corrupt. In this case, the CFA found that Chan had a reasonable excuse because TVB implicitly consented to his participation in the Countdown show, and there was no evidence that the principal objected to the payment or the nature of the act.

#### **Conspiracy and Section 24**
The CFA addressed the issue of whether the reverse onus of proof under section 24 of the POBO (which requires the accused to prove reasonable excuse) applies to conspiracy charges. The CFA held that section 24 does not apply to conspiracy charges, as they are governed by common law principles and the Criminal Offences Ordinance (CO) section 159A, which requires proof of intent or knowledge. The CFA emphasized that the prosecution bears the burden of proving the conspiracy, including the necessary intent to commit the underlying offense.

### 4. Anything Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable About the Case

Several aspects of this case are striking and noteworthy:

- **Unanimous Decision Despite Contradictory Lower Court Rulings:** The CFA’s unanimous decision to quash the convictions, despite the Court of Appeal’s contrary ruling, underscores the importance of the legal principles articulated. It highlights the narrow interpretation of section 9 and the requirement of adverse impact, which may have broader implications for similar cases involving private sector agents.

- **Introduction of the Adverse Impact Requirement:** The CFA’s novel interpretation that an agent’s act must be adverse to the principal’s interests represents a significant departure from the Court of Appeal’s broader view. This requirement adds a layer of complexity to the analysis of section 9 offenses, emphasizing the need to assess not only the nature of the act but also its potential harm to the principal’s interests.

- **Role of Moonlighting and Celebrity Status:** The case illustrates how an agent’s personal activities, such as hosting a talk show, can intersect with their professional duties. The CFA’s emphasis on the agent’s intent and the principal’s consent highlights the fine line between lawful moonlighting and corrupt transactions.

- **Impact on Agency Law:** The decision reinforces the fiduciary obligations of agents and the importance of transparency in private sector dealings. It underscores the principle that agents must prioritize their principal’s interests and cannot accept advantages without proper authorization or disclosure.

- **Public Interest and Anti-Corruption Efforts:** The case reflects Hong Kong’s ongoing efforts to combat corruption, even in the private sector. The CFA’s decision balances the need to prevent corrupt practices with the protection of legitimate business activities, ensuring that the law is applied fairly and narrowly. [end of text]
