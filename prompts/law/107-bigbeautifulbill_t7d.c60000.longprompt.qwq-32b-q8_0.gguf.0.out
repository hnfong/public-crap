Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a summary of each section in this big bill, starting with Sec. 71101. They specified to be concise, up to four sentences per section, and mention specific parties, entities, and quantities. 

First, I need to go through each section listed in the provided bill text. The user mentioned starting with Sec. 71101, so I'll check the document from there. Let me look at the structure. The bill is divided into sections under different chapters and subchapters, mainly focusing on Medicaid, Medicare, health taxes, rural hospitals, debt limit, and unemployment.

Starting with Sec. 71101: It's about a moratorium on implementing a specific rule related to Medicare Savings Programs eligibility and enrollment. The section mentions the Secretary of Health and Human Services can't implement changes from a 2023 final rule until 2034. The rule affects sections 406.21(c), 435.4, etc., in the Code of Federal Regulations. There's also $1 million in funding for 2026. I need to note the parties involved (Secretary, CMS), the time frame, and the specific CFR sections.

Next, Sec. 71102 is similar but for Medicaid, CHIP, and Basic Health Program. The moratorium applies to a 2024 rule, affecting more sections in the CFR. The funding here is shared with Sec. 71101, so I should mention that.

Moving to Sec. 71103: Reducing duplicate enrollments. It amends the Social Security Act to require states to use address info and a new system by 2029 to prevent multiple enrollments. There's $10M in 2026 and $20M in 2029 for the system. The key points are the timeline, the system (subsection (uu)), and the funding.

Sec. 71104 ensures deceased individuals are disenrolled. It adds a requirement to check the Death Master File quarterly, starting 2027. The process involves disenrollment and stopping payments. Specific entities are states and the Secretary.

Sec. 71105 does the same for providers. Providers must be checked against the Death Master File quarterly starting 2028. The amendment is to section 1902(kk)(1).

Sec. 71106 reduces payments for erroneous Medicaid payments. It amends the Social Security Act to limit waivers of erroneous payments, with a 0.03% threshold. The effective date is 2030.

Sec. 71107 requires more frequent eligibility redeterminations every 6 months for certain individuals starting 2027. There's $75M allocated for 2026.

Sec. 71108 revises home equity limits for long-term care eligibility. The limit is $500k for agricultural homes and up to $1M for others, effective 2028. It affects section 1917(f)(1).

Sec. 71109 restricts Medicaid eligibility to U.S. citizens and specific legal residents, excluding others. It amends sections 1903(v) and 2107(e)(1), with $15M funding.

Sec. 71110 increases FMAP for emergency Medicaid for qualifying aliens, with $1M funding.

Subchapter B starts with Sec. 71111, a moratorium on staffing standards for long-term care facilities from a 2024 rule until 2034. It affects parts of 42 CFR 483.

Sec. 71112 reduces state Medicaid costs by shortening the retroactive coverage period. It amends sections 1902(a)(34) and 1905(a), with $10M funding.

Sec. 71113 prohibits federal funds to entities providing abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or life endangerment. It defines prohibited entities as certain non-profits with over $800k in Medicaid funds. Funding is $1M.

Subchapter C: Sec. 71114 sunsets the increased FMAP incentive for expansion states starting 2026.

Sec. 71115 adjusts provider tax thresholds, lowering them over time from 5.5% to 3.5% by 2032. Funding is $20M.

Sec. 71116 limits state-directed payments to 100% or 110% of Medicare rates, with exceptions for rural hospitals. Funding is $7M annually through 2033.

Sec. 71117 requires Medicaid provider taxes to be generally redistributive, preventing preferential rates. It amends section 1903(w).

Sec. 71118 mandates budget neutrality for Medicaid demonstration projects starting 2027, with $5M funding.

Subchapter D: Sec. 71119 requires states to implement community engagement (like work or education) for Medicaid eligibility, with exceptions. It includes $200M in grants and $200M funding.

Sec. 71120 imposes cost-sharing for higher-income Medicaid recipients starting 2028, excluding essential services. Funding is $15M.

Subchapter E: Sec. 71121 expands home/community-based services under 1915(c) waivers, with $50M and $100M in funding.

Chapter 2: Sec. 71201 limits Medicare to U.S. citizens, legal residents, etc., with a phase-out period. It amends Title XVIII.

Sec. 71202 provides a 2.5% payment increase for physicians in 2026-2027. It amends section 1848(t).

Sec. 71203 expands orphan drug exclusion from drug price negotiation until they lose orphan status.

Chapter 3: Sec. 71301 restricts premium tax credits to lawful residents and eligible aliens (citizens, legal residents, etc.), with verification requirements. It amends section 36B.

Sec. 71302 removes premium tax credit during Medicaid ineligibility due to alien status.

Sec. 71303 requires pre-enrollment verification for tax credits, effective 2027.

Sec. 71304 denies tax credits for certain special enrollment periods based on income.

Sec. 71305 removes caps on recapturing advance tax credits.

Subchapter C: Sec. 71306 extends telehealth deductible exemption permanently.

Sec. 71307 allows bronze/catastrophic plans with HSAs starting 2026.

Sec. 71308 treats direct primary care arrangements as non-insurance for HSA purposes, with a $150/month limit.

Chapter 4: Sec. 71401 provides $10B annually through 2030 for rural health transformation programs, with specific uses like tech and workforce.

Subtitle C: Sec. 72001 increases the debt limit by $5 trillion.

Subtitle D: Sec. 73001 stops unemployment benefits for millionaires with over $1M in base period wages, with verification and repayment requirements.

I need to ensure each section is covered concisely, mentioning key parties, specific numbers, and effective dates where applicable. Avoid being vague, so include exact percentages, dollar amounts, and specific legal terms like CFR sections or Act amendments. Also, note any funding allocations and effective dates.
