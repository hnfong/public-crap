Okay, the user wants a summary of each section in the bill, starting with Sec. 60001. They specified that each section should be a paragraph of at most four sentences, with at least one sentence. They want specific details about parties, entities, and quantities, so I need to make sure I don't get too vague.

First, I need to look at the provided text. The bill is titled "An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of H. Con. Res. 14." The main focus is on rescinding various funding programs under different committees. The user is asking for a breakdown of each section, so I should go through each "Sec." listed in the bill and extract the key points.

Starting with Sec. 60001: It's under TITLE VI--COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS. The section is about rescinding funding for clean heavy-duty vehicles. The specific part is section 132 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7432). The user wants to know the parties involved, so the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is the main entity here. The quantity is the unobligated balances, which are rescinded. I need to mention that the funding is rescinded for the EPA's program related to clean heavy-duty vehicles.

Next, Sec. 60002: Repeal of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. This is section 134 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7434). The entity here is the EPA again. The funding is rescinded, and the section is repealed. So the summary should note that the EPA's program is repealed and the funds are rescinded.

Then Sec. 60003: Rescission of funding for diesel emissions reductions. This is section 60104 of Public Law 117-169 (136 Stat. 2067). The entity is the EPA, and the funding is rescinded for diesel emissions reduction programs.

Continuing this way for each section, I need to identify the committee, the specific section number, the entity (usually EPA or other federal agencies), and the exact funding or program being rescinded. Also, check if there are any amendments or changes in the section, like in Sec. 60012 where the period is changed from 2024 to 2034. That's important to note.

I should make sure each summary is concise, mentions the entity, the program or section, the quantity if applicable, and the action taken (rescission or repeal). Also, check for any specific numbers or percentages, like the 3% administrative costs in Sec. 60025 for the Kennedy Center. 

Wait, the user mentioned starting with Sec. 60001, which is in the Environment and Public Works committee. The other sections are in different titles, so I need to structure each summary by the section number, the committee, the entity, and the specific action. Also, note any amendments or changes in the section, like the period in Sec. 60012. 

I need to avoid using vague terms. For example, instead of saying "various programs," specify the exact program or section. Also, ensure that each paragraph is at most four sentences. Let me check each section one by one and extract the necessary details. 

For Sec. 60001: Rescind funding for EPA's clean heavy-duty vehicle program. The unobligated balances are rescinded. 

Sec. 60002: Repeal of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (EPA) and rescind funds. 

Sec. 60003: Rescind diesel emissions reduction funds for EPA. 

Sec. 60004: Rescind air pollution funding for EPA. 

Sec. 60005: Rescind school air pollution funding for EPA. 

Sec. 60006: Rescind low emissions electricity program funds for EPA. 

Sec. 60007: Rescind section 211(o) of Clean Air Act for EPA. 

Sec. 60008: Rescind implementation of American Innovation and Manufacturing Act for EPA. 

Sec. 60009: Rescind enforcement tech and public info funds for EPA. 

Sec. 60010: Rescind corporate reporting funds for EPA. 

Sec. 60011: Rescind environmental product declaration assistance for EPA. 

Sec. 60012: Rescind methane emissions program for EPA, and change the period from 2024 to 2034. 

Sec. 60013: Rescind greenhouse gas air pollution plans for EPA. 

Sec. 60014: Rescind EPA's efficient reviews for environmental protection. 

Sec. 60015: Rescind low-embodied carbon labeling for construction materials. 

Sec. 60016: Rescind environmental and climate justice block grants for EPA. 

Sec. 60017: Rescind ESA recovery plans for EPA. 

Sec. 60018: Rescind environmental data collection for EPA. 

Sec. 60019: Rescind neighborhood access grants for the Department of Transportation. 

Sec. 60020: Rescind federal building assistance for the Department of Transportation. 

Sec. 60021: Rescind low-carbon materials for federal buildings. 

Sec. 60022: Rescind GSA sustainable tech funds. 

Sec. 60023: Rescind environmental review implementation funds for the Department of Transportation. 

Sec. 60024: Rescind low-carbon transportation materials grants for the Department of Transportation. 

Sec. 60025: Appropriated $256,657,000 for the Kennedy Center, with 3% for admin costs. 

Sec. 60026: Adds a new section to the National Environmental Policy Act requiring project sponsors to pay fees for environmental assessments, with specific percentages and deadlines. 

I need to make sure each summary is accurate, specific, and within the sentence limit. Also, check that the entities are correctly identified, like the EPA for most of these sections, and the Department of Transportation for some. The user might be interested in understanding the impact of these rescissions on specific programs, so including the exact program names and the entities responsible is key. 

I should also note any amendments, like the period change in Sec. 60012. For the Kennedy Center, the amount is $256,657,000, and the admin cost is 3%. For the environmental review fees, the fee is 125% of anticipated costs, with deadlines for assessments and impact statements. 

Make sure not to miss any sections, especially the ones that have both rescission and amendments. Also, check that the references to Public Law 117-169 are included if relevant. 

Once all sections are covered, the user can get a clear, concise summary of each part of the bill, focusing on the specific changes made by each section. This should help them understand the bill's impact on various federal programs and agencies.
