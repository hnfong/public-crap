**Sec. 10101. Re-evaluation of thrifty food plan.**
The Secretary of Agriculture must base SNAP allotments on the 2021 Thrifty Food Plan cost for a standard family of four, applying fixed percentage ratios for households of different sizes (e.g., 30% for one person, 100% for four). Cost adjustments for Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, and the Virgin Islands are permitted to reflect local food prices, with a cap that island costs cannot exceed the 50-state average. The plan's cost will be adjusted annually on October 1, 2025, and thereafter based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers. Market basket re-evaluations may occur starting October 1, 2027, but any changes must be cost-neutral and cannot increase the overall plan cost.

**Sec. 10102. Modifications to SNAP work requirements for able-bodied adults.**
This section expands exemptions from SNAP work requirements for able-bodied adults to include pregnant women, California Indians, and Urban Indians, while retaining existing exemptions for those under 18, over 65, or with disabilities. It standardizes the definition of "noncontiguous State" to exclude Guam and the Virgin Islands, applying the 1.5 times national unemployment rate threshold only to states like Alaska and Hawaii. A new exemption allows the Secretary to waive work requirements for noncontiguous states if the state agency demonstrates a "good faith effort" to comply, with exemptions expiring no later than December 31, 2028. State agencies must submit quarterly progress reports to maintain these exemptions and face early termination if they fail to meet reporting or compliance milestones.

**Sec. 10103. Availability of standard utility allowances based on receipt of energy assistance.**
The bill amends SNAP utility allowance rules to specifically allow households with an elderly or disabled member to claim standard utility allowances even if they do not receive energy assistance. Conversely, households without an elderly or disabled member must receive energy assistance to qualify for these standard utility allowances. This change creates a distinction in eligibility based on household composition regarding the receipt of energy assistance payments.

**Sec. 10104. Restrictions on internet expenses.**
The Secretary of Agriculture is prohibited from counting any service fees associated with internet connections when calculating the excess shelter expense deduction for SNAP households. This restriction ensures that internet costs cannot be used to artificially inflate the shelter expense deduction amount for eligible families.

**Sec. 10105. Matching funds requirements.**
Beginning in fiscal year 2028, states with a SNAP payment error rate below 6 percent will receive 100 percent federal funding, while states with error rates between 6 and 8 percent will see their federal share drop to 95 percent. States with error rates between 8 and 10 percent will receive 90 percent federal funding, and those with rates of 10 percent or higher will receive only 85 percent, requiring the state to cover the remaining share. States with error rates that, when multiplied by 1.5, exceed 20 percent in fiscal years 2025 or 2026 will have the implementation of these penalties delayed until fiscal years 2029 or 2030, respectively.

**Sec. 10106. Administrative cost sharing.**
The federal share of SNAP administrative costs for state agencies is set at 50 percent through fiscal year 2026, after which the federal share decreases to 25 percent for fiscal year 2027 and all subsequent years. This reduction shifts the majority of the administrative cost burden from the federal government to the states starting in 2027.

**Sec. 10107. National education and obesity prevention grant program.**
The authorization for the National Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program is extended to cover fiscal years 2016 through 2025, replacing the previous language that authorized funding for 2016 and each subsequent year indefinitely. This change effectively caps the program's mandatory funding authorization at the end of fiscal year 2025.

**Sec. 10108. Alien SNAP eligibility.**
SNAP eligibility is restricted to U.S. citizens, nationals, lawful permanent residents, Cuban and Haitian entrants, and individuals under Compact of Free Association agreements, explicitly excluding temporary visitors, tourists, diplomats, and students. The income and financial resources of any household member rendered ineligible under these new restrictions must still be counted when determining the eligibility and allotment value for the rest of the household.

**Sec. 10201. Rescission of amounts for forestry.**
The bill rescinds all unobligated balances from specific provisions of Public Law 117-169 related to forestry, including sections 23001(a)(3)-(4), 23002(a)(1)-(4), 23003(a)(2), and 23005. These rescinded funds are removed from the available appropriations for the Department of Agriculture's forestry programs.

**Sec. 10301. Effective reference price; reference price.**
The effective reference price for Price Loss Coverage (PLC) programs is increased from 85 percent to 88 percent of the reference price starting with the 2025 crop year. New reference prices are established for 2025, including $6.35 for wheat, $4.10 for corn, $10.00 for soybeans, and $630.00 for peanuts, among others. These reference prices will automatically increase by 0.5 percent annually starting in the 2031 crop year, subject to a cap of 113 percent of the 2025 base prices.

**Sec. 10302. Base acres.**
The Secretary must allocate up to 30,000,000 additional base acres to eligible farms starting in the 2026 crop year, based on the difference between a farm's 5-year average planted acreage (2019-2023) and its existing base acres. Eligibility requires that the farm's average planted acreage exceeds its current base acres, and farms with zero planted acreage of covered commodities during the 2019-2023 period are ineligible. If the total eligible acres exceed 30 million, the Secretary must apply an across-the-board pro-rata reduction to ensure the cap is met.

**Sec. 10303. Producer election.**
Producers are given the option to elect coverage for the 2026 crop year and must choose the same coverage for each covered commodity for the 2027 through 2031 crop years as was applicable for the 2025 crop year. For the 2025 crop year specifically, the Secretary must make the higher of Price Loss Coverage (PLC) or Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) payments on a commodity-by-commodity basis. This provision extends the deadline for making these elections from 2023 to 2031.

**Sec. 10304. Price loss coverage.**
The Price Loss Coverage (PLC) program provisions are extended to cover crop years through 2031, updating references from 2023 to 2031 in the relevant sections of the Agricultural Act of 2014. The payment yield calculation for PLC is updated to use the 2017 through 2021 crop years instead of the previous 2012 through 2016 period.

**Sec. 10305. Agriculture risk coverage.**
The Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) program is extended through the 2031 crop year, with benchmark revenue calculations set at 90 percent for the 2025 through 2031 period. The coverage guarantee for ARC is increased from 10 percent to 12 percent of the benchmark revenue for the 2025 through 2031 crop years.

**Sec. 10306. Equitable treatment of certain entities.**
The definition of "qualified pass-through entity" is expanded to include partnerships, S corporations, LLCs not electing corporate treatment, and joint ventures, replacing previous limitations on joint ventures and general partnerships. This change ensures these entities are treated consistently regarding payment attribution, active engagement in farming status, joint and several liability, and Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) calculations.

**Sec. 10307. Payment limitations.**
The payment limitation for covered commodities is increased from $125,000 to $155,000 per person or legal entity for the 2025 crop year and each subsequent year. The Secretary is required to annually adjust this $155,000 limit for inflation based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers.

**Sec. 10308. Adjusted gross income limitation.**
The AGI limitation for farm program eligibility is modified to exclude certain payments, such as those under the Agricultural Act of 2014 and the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996, from the calculation. An exception is created for operations where at least 75 percent of their average gross income derives from farming, ranching, or silviculture activities, allowing them to bypass the AGI limitation.

**Sec. 10309. Marketing loans.**
Marketing assistance loan rates are established for the 2026 through 2031 crop years, with specific rates set for commodities like wheat ($3.72/bu), corn ($2.42/bu), soybeans ($6.82/bu), and cotton ($0.55/lb for upland). The Secretary is authorized to make cotton storage payments for the 2026 through 2031 period at rates of $4.90 per hundredweight in California/Arizona and $3.00 elsewhere. Loan deficiency payments and recourse loans are extended to cover crop years through 2031.

**Sec. 10310. Repayment of marketing loans.**
Repayment rates for marketing loans on long grain rice, medium grain rice, and extra long staple cotton are adjusted to be the lesser of the loan rate or the prevailing world market price. For upland cotton, producers repaying at the world market price will receive a refund if the lowest world market price during the 30 days following repayment is lower than the repayment rate. Extra long staple cotton loan rates may be adjusted to minimize government stock accumulation and ensure competitive marketing through July 31, 2032.

**Sec. 10311. Economic adjustment assistance for textile mills.**
The value of economic adjustment assistance for textile mills is increased from 3 cents per pound to 5 cents per pound for the period beginning August 1, 2025. This assistance applies to the period from August 1, 2013, through July 31, 2025, at the lower rate, and continues at the higher rate thereafter.

**Sec. 10312. Sugar program updates.**
The loan rate for raw cane sugar is set at 24.00 cents per pound for the 2025 through 2031 crop years, with the refined sugar loan rate set at 136.55 percent of the raw cane sugar rate. The Commodity Credit Corporation must establish storage rates for forfeited sugar at a minimum of 34 cents per hundredweight per month for refined sugar and 27 cents for raw cane sugar. The Secretary is authorized to reallocate tariff-rate quota shortfalls and must conduct a study on refined sugar import terms within 180 days.

**Sec. 10313. Dairy policy updates.**
The Dairy Margin Coverage (DMC) production history is based on the highest annual milk marketings from 2021, 2022, or 2023, with new operations allowed to extrapolate actual marketings or estimate based on herd size. The DMC payment limit is increased from 5,000,000 pounds to 6,000,000 pounds for both Tier I and Tier II coverage. Premium discounts for DMC are extended to the 2026 through 2031 period, and the program's duration is extended to 2031.

**Sec. 10314. Implementation.**
The Secretary is authorized to use $50,000,000 to implement the commodity provisions of the Act, with specific allocations including $9,000,000 for mandatory dairy production cost surveys and $1,000,000 for the refined sugar study. The funds are to remain available until expended and are distributed among various administrative and research activities related to the sugar and dairy programs.

**Sec. 10401. Supplemental agricultural disaster assistance.**
Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP) payments are increased to 100 percent of market value for predation losses and 75 percent for adverse weather or disease, with additional payments for unborn livestock at up to 85 percent of the lowest weight class rate. The Livestock Forage Disaster Program (LFP) is expanded to allow two monthly payments for droughts lasting 4 consecutive weeks or 7 of the previous 8 consecutive weeks. Emergency assistance is extended to cover losses from bird depredation on farm-raised fish at a minimum rate of $600 per acre, and honeybee colony losses now utilize a 15 percent normal mortality rate.

**Sec. 10501. Beginning farmer and rancher benefit.**
The definition of a "beginning farmer or rancher" is expanded to include those in their first 10 years of operation, up from the previous 5 years. Beginning farmers receive additional premium assistance of 5 percentage points for the first two reinsurance years, 3 percentage points for the third year, and 1 percentage point for the fourth year.

**Sec. 10502. Area-based crop insurance coverage and affordability.**
Area-based crop insurance coverage levels are increased to allow up to 95 percent coverage for area yield or revenue plans, up from previous limits. The premium subsidy for area-based plans is increased to 80 percent, up from 65 percent, to improve affordability for producers.

**Sec. 10503. Administrative and operating expense adjustments.**
Approved insurance providers will receive an additional 6 percent administrative and operating expense subsidy for eligible contracts in states with loss ratios exceeding 120 percent of the net book premium. Reimbursement rates for specialty crops are set to be the greater of 17 percent of the premium or the standard rate, and an inflation adjustment is applied to administrative expenses starting in 2026.

**Sec. 10504. Premium support.**
The federal premium subsidy rates for crop insurance are increased across all coverage levels: 69 percent for catastrophic coverage (up from 64), 64 percent for 50 percent coverage (up from 59), 60 percent for 60 percent coverage (up from 55), 51 percent for 70 percent coverage (up from 48), and 41 percent for 80 percent coverage (up from 38).

**Sec. 10505. Program compliance and integrity.**
The maximum penalty for crop insurance violations is increased from $4,000,000 to $6,000,000 for fiscal year 2026 and each subsequent fiscal year. This increase applies to penalties assessed for violations occurring in fiscal years 2026 and beyond, while the lower limit remains for prior years.

**Sec. 10506. Reviews, compliance, and integrity.**
Funding for reviews, compliance, and integrity activities is increased to $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2026 and each subsequent fiscal year, up from the previous funding levels for 2014 through 2025. This additional funding supports the Risk Management Agency's efforts to ensure program integrity.

**Sec. 10507. Poultry insurance pilot program.**
The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation is authorized to establish a pilot program for index-based insurance for contract poultry growers to cover extreme weather-related risks that increase utility costs. The pilot must be conducted in a sufficient number of counties in top poultry-producing states and must be evaluated for feasibility and demand. The Board must approve a permanent policy or plan based on the pilot results no later than two years after enactment.

**Sec. 10601. Conservation.**
Funding for conservation programs is increased significantly, with $625 million allocated for fiscal year 2026 and rising to $700 million annually through 2031 for general conservation. The Regional Conservation Partnership Program receives $425 million for 2026 and $450 million annually thereafter through 2031. Additional funding is provided for watershed protection ($150 million annually from 2026), feral swine control ($105 million for 2025-2031), and the Grassroots Source Water Protection Program ($1 million starting in 2026).
