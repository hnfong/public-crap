**Sec. 40001. Coast Guard Mission Readiness**
This section appropriates $24,593,500,000 to the Coast Guard for fiscal year 2025 to remain available until September 30, 2029, for procuring new assets, maintaining existing systems, and improving shore infrastructure. Specific allocations include $4,300,000,000 for Offshore Patrol Cutters, $4,300,000,000 for Polar Security Cutters, and $3,500,000,000 for Arctic Security Cutters to ensure presence in the Arctic and Antarctic. The funding also covers $1,142,500,000 for fixed-wing aircraft, $2,283,000,000 for rotary-wing aircraft, and $4,379,000,000 for shore facility construction, including $500,000,000 for the Coast Guard Yard. Additionally, $2,200,000,000 is designated for depot maintenance and $170,000,000 for maritime domain awareness improvements.

**Sec. 40002. Spectrum Auctions**
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is authorized to grant licenses for at least 300 megahertz of spectrum, including 100 megahertz in the 3.98 to 4.2 gigahertz band, within two years of enactment. The Assistant Secretary of Commerce must identify an additional 500 megahertz of frequencies between 1.3 and 10.5 gigahertz for reallocation to non-Federal use, with 200 megahertz identified within two years and the remainder within four years. The FCC must auction at least 200 megahertz of these identified frequencies within four years and any remaining identified spectrum within eight years. The President retains the authority to modify or withdraw any frequency for national security reasons 60 days before a scheduled auction, and $50,000,000 is appropriated to the Department of Commerce to support these efforts through 2034.

**Sec. 40003. Air Traffic Control Improvements**
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) receives $11,830,000,000 for fiscal year 2025 to remain available until September 30, 2029, for modernizing telecommunications, replacing radar systems, and constructing a new Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC). This funding mandates the divestment and integration of at least three existing ARTCCs into the new center and the closure or consolidation of at least ten existing ARTCCs under a realignment effort. Specific allocations include $4,750,000,000 for telecommunications infrastructure, $3,000,000,000 for radar replacement, and $1,000,000,000 for the recapitalization and consolidation of Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) facilities. The FAA Administrator must submit quarterly reports to Congress detailing expenditures for these aviation safety improvements.

**Sec. 40004. Space Launch and Reentry Licensing and Permitting User Fees**
The Secretary of Transportation is authorized to impose user fees on space launches and reentries starting in 2026, calculated as the lesser of a per-pound rate or a flat fee, with rates increasing annually through 2034. The per-pound fee begins at $0.25 in 2026 and rises to $1.50 by 2033, while the flat fee starts at $30,000 in 2026 and reaches $200,000 by 2033, with subsequent increases tied to the Consumer Price Index. These fees will be deposited into a new fund to support the Office of Commercial Space Transportation, with 70 percent of the funds available without further appropriation. The section also establishes a requirement for the Department of Commerce to publish biennial reports on the value of federal spectrum usage through June 30, 2034.

**Sec. 40005. Mars Missions, Artemis Missions, and Moon to Mars Program**
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is appropriated $9,995,000,000 for fiscal year 2025 to remain available until September 30, 2032, for Mars telecommunications, the Gateway lunar station, and Artemis missions IV and V. Specific allocations include $700,000,000 for a high-performance Mars telecommunications orbiter, $2,600,000,000 for the Gateway program, and $4,100,000,000 for the Space Launch System for Artemis IV and V. The funding also covers $1,250,000,000 for International Space Station operations and $1,000,000,000 for infrastructure improvements at major centers including Kennedy Space Center, Johnson Space Center, and Stennis Space Center. Funds must be obligated such that at least 50 percent is spent by September 30, 2028, and 100 percent by September 30, 2029.

**Sec. 40006. Corporate Average Fuel Economy Civil Penalties**
This section amends title 49 of the United States Code to reduce the civil penalty for failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards from $5 per vehicle to $0.00 for model years where the Secretary of Transportation has not yet issued a penalty notification. The amendment also changes the penalty for exceeding the standard from $10 to $0.00, effectively eliminating these specific civil penalties for manufacturers. These changes take effect immediately upon enactment and apply to all model years for which a penalty notification has not been previously provided.

**Sec. 40007. Payments for Lease of Metropolitan Washington Airports**
The lease agreement for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority is amended to require annual payments to the Treasury that increase from an inflation-adjusted $3,000,000 (1987 dollars) to a fixed $15,000,000 (2027 dollars) starting in 2027. The Secretary of Transportation and the Airports Authority must renegotiate the payment level every ten years to ensure the 2027 dollar amount never falls below $15,000,000. This adjustment significantly increases the financial obligation of the Airports Authority to the federal government for the use of Reagan National and Dulles International airports.

**Sec. 40008. Rescission of Certain Amounts for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration**
This section permanently rescinds any unobligated balances of funds previously appropriated or made available under sections 40001, 40002, 40003, and 40004 of Public Law 117-169. The rescission applies specifically to amounts that were not spent or committed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) or other relevant entities under those prior authorizations. By rescinding these funds, the government removes the obligation to spend them, effectively reducing the total available budget for NOAA under those specific prior laws.

**Sec. 40009. Reduction in Annual Transfers to Travel Promotion Fund**
The Travel Promotion Act of 2009 is amended to reduce the annual transfer from the general fund of the Treasury to the Travel Promotion Fund from $100,000,000 to $20,000,000. This reduction directly decreases the federal funding available for the organization responsible for promoting the United States as a travel destination. The change takes effect immediately and applies to all future annual transfers under the Act.

**Sec. 40010. Treatment of Unobligated Funds for Alternative Fuel and Low-Emission Aviation Technology**
This section permanently rescinds any unobligated balances of funds previously made available under section 40007(a) of title IV of Public Law 117-169, which supported alternative fuel and low-emission aviation technology. By rescinding these funds, the government cancels the obligation to spend the remaining unallocated money designated for these specific aviation technology initiatives. This action reduces the overall budget available for the development and deployment of alternative fuels in the aviation sector.

**Sec. 40011. Rescission of Amounts Appropriated to Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund**
This section permanently rescinds $850,000,000 of the unobligated balances made available under section 106(a) of the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 for the Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund. The rescission removes these funds from the available budget, effectively canceling the obligation to spend them on the innovation fund's intended purposes. This action reduces the total funding available for strengthening the public wireless supply chain under the CHIPS Act. [end of text]
