Okay, the user wants a summary of every section in this big bill, starting with Sec. 50101. They mentioned it's a huge bill championed by President Trump, so I need to make sure I'm accurate and concise. Let me start by looking at Sec. 50101.

Sec. 50101 is about onshore oil and gas leasing. The bill repeals parts of the Inflation Reduction Act that increased royalty rates and restricted leasing. It requires the Secretary of the Interior to resume quarterly lease sales in specific states, ensuring timely environmental reviews. They also amended the Mineral Leasing Act to expand leasing areas and allow commingling of production. I need to mention the states involved and the specific changes to the leasing process.

Next, Sec. 50102 deals with offshore leasing. The Gulf of America region needs 30 lease sales by 2040, with specific timing. Alaska requires 6 sales by 2032. Royalty rates are set between 12.5% and 16.67%, and there's revenue sharing for Alaska. I should note the number of sales, the regions, and the royalty rate changes.

Sec. 50103 is about methane royalties. It repeals a provision from the Inflation Reduction Act that taxed methane. That's straightforward—just state that the tax is removed.

Sec. 50104 is Alaska oil and gas leasing. It requires 4 lease sales by 2034, with specific acreages and revenue sharing. The Coastal Plain is targeted, and funds go to Alaska. I need to mention the number of sales, acreages, and the percentage to Alaska.

Sec. 50105 is about the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. It restores leasing there, with 5 sales by 2030, and revenue sharing. Highlight the restoration and the sales schedule.

Moving to Subtitle B, Sec. 50201 is coal leasing. Qualified applications must be processed within 90 days, and lease sales are required. Mention the timeline and the requirement for environmental reviews.

Sec. 50202 is coal royalty rates. The rate is lowered to 12.5% but can be up to 7% until 2034. Existing leases are affected, and there's a credit for advance royalties. Need to specify the rate change and the temporary reduction.

Sec. 50203 is about leasing known recoverable coal resources. 4 million acres must be leased in 90 days, excluding protected areas. Mention the acreage and exclusions.

Sec. 50204 authorizes mining Federal coal adjacent to private land. The Secretary must authorize mining without major changes. Keep it brief about the authorization and the timeline.

Subtitle C, Sec. 50301 is timber sales. The Forest Service must sell more timber annually, and long-term contracts are required. Specify the quantities and the contract details.

Sec. 50302 is renewable energy fees. Wind and solar projects pay acreage rent and capacity fees, with adjustments. Mention the calculation and the payment terms.

Sec. 50303 is revenue sharing for renewable energy. 25% goes to states, 25% to counties based on land. Highlight the percentages and the allocation.

Subtitle D, Sec. 50401 is Strategic Petroleum Reserve maintenance and funding. $218 million for maintenance and $171 million for acquisitions. Also, repeals a drawdown mandate.

Sec. 50402 repeals and rescinds several sections from the Inflation Reduction Act. List the sections being rescinded.

Sec. 50403 is energy dominance financing. Amends the Energy Policy Act to support grid reliability and funds $1 billion for activities.

Sec. 50404 is about AI models for science and engineering. $150 million for data curation and AI development. Mention the funding and the goals.

Subtitle E, Sec. 50501 is water conveyance and storage. $1 billion for Bureau of Reclamation projects. Specify the appropriation and the purpose.

I need to ensure each summary is concise, within 4 sentences, and includes specific details like parties, entities, and quantities. Avoid vague terms and stick to the bill's exact language. Check that I didn't miss any key points and that the summaries are accurate. Also, make sure to start with Sec. 50101 as requested.
