**1. Briefly summarize the facts of the case:**

The case involves four primary school teachers and a friend who were charged with an offense under s 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200) for obtaining access to a computer with a view to dishonest gain for another. The teachers had been provided with a set of interview questions for a competitive admission process, and they used their mobile phones and a school computer to transmit the questions to third parties. The respondents were acquitted by the magistrate, and the Secretary for Justice appealed the decision. The appeal was heard by the Court of Final Appeal, which considered the scope of the actus reus of the offense under s 161(1)(c).

**2. Briefly summarize the arguments of the two parties:**

The Secretary for Justice (appellant) argued that the respondents committed the offense by obtaining access to a computer with a view to dishonest gain for another, regardless of whether the computer belonged to them or someone else. The appellant submitted that the use of a smartphone or computer to access and transmit information constitutes "access to a computer" under s 161(1)(c). The respondents (appellants) argued that the offense requires unauthorized extraction and use of information from a computer, and that their actions did not meet this requirement since they used their own devices to access and transmit the interview questions.

**3. Summarize the legal principles (ratio decidendi) of the case:**

The Court of Final Appeal held that the offense under s 161(1)(c) does not apply to the use by a person of their own computer, unless that use involves accessing another's computer. The court considered the statutory text, context, and purpose of the provision, and concluded that the ordinary meaning of the words "obtains access to a computer" suggests unauthorized use of a computer belonging to someone else. The court also considered the legislative history and purpose of the provision, which was to create a new offense of "dishonest accessing" to make it unlawful to gain access to computers with intent to deceive, cause loss to another, or gain for the offender.

The court noted that the provision was enacted to address the preparatory work for computer-related crimes, which can be performed without committing any existing offense. The court also considered the amendments made to other statutes by the Computer Crimes Ordinance 1993, which suggest that the provision was intended to cover access to someone else's computer. The court rejected the appellant's argument that the provision should be construed to cover the use of one's own computer, citing the ordinary meaning of the words "obtains access to a computer" and the legislative history and purpose of the provision.

The court also considered the appellant's argument that a restrictive interpretation of s 161 would undermine its purpose and efficacy in combating computer-related crime. However, the court held that the provision was intended to create preparatory offenses, and that its purpose would not be served by extending it to cover the use of one's own computer. The court also noted that the provision has been applied in various cases involving the misuse of computers, but these cases involved accessing someone else's computer.

In conclusion, the court held that the offense under s 161(1)(c) does not apply to the use by a person of their own computer, unless that use involves accessing another's computer. This decision is significant because it clarifies the scope of the offense and provides guidance on the interpretation of the provision.

**Novel or controversial points:**

* The court's interpretation of the provision as not applying to the use of one's own computer, unless that use involves accessing another's computer, is a novel and controversial point. This interpretation is based on the ordinary meaning of the words "obtains access to a computer" and the legislative history and purpose of the provision.
* The court's consideration of the legislative history and purpose of the provision is also a novel and controversial point. The court's analysis of the amendments made to other statutes by the Computer Crimes Ordinance 1993 and the recommendations of the Legislative Council Subcommittee provides insight into the legislative intent behind the provision.
* The court's rejection of the appellant's argument that a restrictive interpretation of s 161 would undermine its purpose and efficacy in combating computer-related crime is also a novel and controversial point. The court's conclusion that the provision was intended to create preparatory offenses and that its purpose would not be served by extending it to cover the use of one's own computer is a significant departure from the appellant's argument.
