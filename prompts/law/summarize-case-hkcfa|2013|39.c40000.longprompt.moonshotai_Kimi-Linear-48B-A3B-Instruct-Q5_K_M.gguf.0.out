### 1. Briefly summarize the facts of the above case.

The case involves **W**, a post-operative male-to-female transsexual who wishes to marry her male partner in Hong Kong. The Registrar of Marriages refused to allow the marriage, citing the **Marriage Ordinance (Cap. 181)** and **Matrimonial Causes Ordinance (Cap. 179)**, which define marriage as a union between one man and one woman, and require the parties to be "respectively male and female." W challenged this decision, arguing that she is legally a woman and thus entitled to marry under **Article 37 of the Basic Law** and **Article 19(2) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights**, which guarantee the right to marry. The case ultimately reached the **Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong (HKCFA)**, which had to decide whether the statutory definitions of "woman" and "male/female" include post-operative transsexuals and whether the law is constitutional.

### 2. Briefly summarize the arguments of the two parties.

**Appellant (W):**
- Argued that she is legally a woman under the law, having undergone full sex reassignment surgery (SRS) and living as a woman.
- Contended that the statutory definitions of "woman" and "male/female" should include post-operative transsexuals for marriage purposes.
- Relied on **Article 37 (right to marry)** and **Article 19(2) (right of men and women to marry)** of the Basic Law and Bill of Rights, arguing that the current law unconstitutionally restricts her rights.
- Emphasized that the law should adapt to modern medical and social realities, including the recognition of transsexuals' acquired gender.

**Respondent (Registrar of Marriages):**
- Argued that the statutory definitions of "woman" and "male/female" refer to biological sex at birth, as established in **Corbett v Corbett** (UK case law).
- Contended that the law does not intend to include post-operative transsexuals as "women" for marriage purposes.
- Asserted that the right to marry under the Basic Law and Bill of Rights does not extend to transsexuals in their acquired gender, as the traditional concept of marriage is between biological men and women.
- Argued that the issue should be left to the legislature, not the courts, due to the far-reaching social and legal implications.

### 3. Summarize the legal principles (ratio decidendi) of the case.

The **HKCFA** ruled in favor of W, holding that post-operative male-to-female transsexuals can be considered "women" for the purposes of marriage under Hong Kong law. The key legal principles are:

#### **Statutory Interpretation:**
- The court rejected the **Corbett v Corbett** approach (biological criteria fixed at birth) as the sole determinant of sex for marriage purposes.
- The court adopted a **remedial interpretation** of the Marriage Ordinance and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance, reading "woman" and "female" to include post-operative transsexuals who have undergone full SRS.
- The court emphasized that statutory definitions must be interpreted in light of **constitutional rights** (Article 37 and Article 19(2) of the Basic Law and Bill of Rights).

#### **Constitutional Rights:**
- The right to marry under **Article 37** and **Article 19(2)** is not limited to biological men and women but extends to post-operative transsexuals in their acquired gender.
- The court held that denying transsexuals the right to marry in their acquired gender **impairs the essence of the right to marry**, as recognized in **Goodwin v UK** (ECHR).
- The court rejected the Registrar’s argument that the legislature should decide the issue, stating that courts must protect minority rights under the constitution.

#### **Procreation and Consummation:**
- The court rejected the argument that procreation is an essential element of marriage, noting that many marriages are childless or involve individuals who cannot procreate.
- Consummation can occur even if only possible through surgery, and the inability to procreate does not invalidate a marriage.

#### **International and Social Trends:**
- The court acknowledged the **increasing international trend** toward recognizing post-operative transsexuals’ right to marry in their acquired gender (e.g., UK’s Goodwin decision, Australia, Canada, etc.).
- While Hong Kong’s social attitudes were not as progressive as Europe’s, the court found that the constitutional right to marry must adapt to changing circumstances.

#### **Remedial Interpretation:**
- The court granted a **declaration of unconstitutionality** but suspended its effect for 12 months to allow the legislature to amend the law.
- If no legislation is passed, the court’s decision would take effect, allowing W and others in her position to marry.

### 4. Is there anything striking, unusual or remarkable about the case?

Yes, several aspects of this case are striking:

#### **(1) Bold Constitutional Interpretation:**
- The HKCFA **rejected the traditional biological criteria** (Corbett approach) and adopted a **remedial interpretation** of statutory language to align with constitutional rights. This is unusual because courts typically interpret statutes based on legislative intent, not constitutional principles, unless the statute is clearly unconstitutional.

#### **(2) Human Rights vs. Legislative Intent:**
- The case highlights a **conflict between judicial activism (protecting minority rights) and legislative intent (defining marriage as biological).** The court prioritized constitutional rights over statutory text, which is controversial in common law systems where courts defer to legislative definitions.

#### **(3) International Precedent vs. Local Context:**
- While the court cited **Goodwin v UK** and other international cases, it noted that Hong Kong’s social attitudes were not as progressive. Yet, it still ruled in favor of W, showing a **willingness to lead rather than follow** local public opinion.

#### **(4) Suspension of Effect:**
- The court **suspended its declaration for 12 months** to allow the legislature to amend the law. This is unusual because courts typically strike down laws immediately or issue immediate declarations. The suspension reflects a **delicate balance between judicial intervention and legislative autonomy**.

#### **(5) Dissenting Opinion (Mr Justice Chan):**
- **Mr Justice Chan** (the only dissenting judge) argued that the legislature, not the courts, should decide whether to extend marriage rights to transsexuals. His dissent underscores the **constitutional tension** between judicial interpretation and democratic lawmaking.

#### **(6) Broader Implications:**
- The case is **not just about marriage** but about **legal recognition of transsexuals’ gender identity** across multiple areas (e.g., pensions, inheritance, anti-discrimination laws). The court’s reasoning could influence future cases beyond marriage.

#### **(7) The "Living Instrument" Doctrine:**
- The court treated the **Basic Law and Bill of Rights as "living instruments"**, adapting to modern societal changes. This is a **progressive approach** in common law jurisdictions, where constitutional rights are often interpreted narrowly.

### **Conclusion:**
This case is remarkable for its **bold judicial intervention** in redefining marriage law to include post-operative transsexuals, while simultaneously **deferring to the legislature** to implement the change. It reflects a **global trend toward recognizing transsexuals’ rights** but does so within a **constitutional framework** that balances human rights with democratic governance. The case is a landmark in **LGBTQ+ rights** and **constitutional interpretation** in Asia. [end of text]
