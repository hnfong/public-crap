### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case involves a challenge to the constitutionality of the Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245) in Hong Kong, specifically the provisions that regulate public processions and meetings. The case centers on a public procession held on February 10, 2002, in Chater Garden, which was organized to protest the conviction of an activist for assaulting a police officer. The procession, which began with about 40 participants and grew to around 96, was not notified to the police as required by the Ordinance. The police had warned the organizers to comply with the notification requirement, but they did not. As a result, the procession was deemed an "unauthorized assembly," and the organizers were convicted under Section 17A of the Ordinance for holding and assisting in the unauthorized assembly. The case was appealed to the Court of Final Appeal, where the issue was whether the Ordinance's provisions, particularly the Commissioner's discretion to restrict public processions under the guise of "public order (ordre public)," were constitutional.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties

**Appellants (Leung Kwok Hung and Others):**  
The appellants argued that the Ordinance's provisions, particularly the Commissioner's broad discretion to restrict public processions under the concept of "public order (ordre public)," were unconstitutional. They contended that the term "public order" was too vague and overly broad, failing to meet the constitutional requirements of "prescribed by law" and "necessity." They argued that the Ordinance's provisions did not provide sufficient legal certainty, making it impossible for citizens to know what conduct would be lawful. They also claimed that the Ordinance's restrictions on peaceful assembly violated the rights guaranteed by Article 27 of the Basic Law and Article 17 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (BORO), which protect the right to peaceful assembly.

**Respondent (Government):**  
The government defended the Ordinance, arguing that the provisions were necessary to maintain public order and prevent disorder. They contended that the concept of "public order" was a well-established legal principle and that the Ordinance's provisions were consistent with international human rights standards, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The government also argued that the Ordinance's notification and prior restraint mechanisms were necessary to enable the police to manage public gatherings and ensure public safety. They rejected the appellants' claim that the Ordinance was too vague, asserting that the provisions were sufficiently clear and that the courts had the authority to interpret them in a way that balanced individual rights with public interests.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) of the Case

The Court of Final Appeal held that the Ordinance's provisions, particularly the Commissioner's discretion to restrict public processions under the guise of "public order (ordre public)," were **unconstitutional** due to their failure to meet the constitutional requirements of **"prescribed by law"** and **"necessity."** The Court emphasized that the right to peaceful assembly is a fundamental constitutional right under the Basic Law and the ICCPR, and that any restriction on this right must be **clear, specific, and proportionate**.

#### **Prescribed by Law Requirement**
The Court held that the Ordinance's provisions were **not sufficiently precise** to satisfy the "prescribed by law" requirement. The term "public order (ordre public)" was deemed too vague and imprecise, making it impossible for citizens to know what conduct would be lawful. The Court noted that while the ICCPR allows for broad interpretations of "public order," the Ordinance's provisions did not provide the necessary legal certainty required by constitutional standards. The Court emphasized that the **"prescribed by law" requirement** is not merely about the existence of a legal framework but about the **clarity and specificity** of the legal rules that govern the exercise of fundamental rights.

#### **Necessity Requirement**
The Court applied the **proportionality test** to assess whether the restrictions on peaceful assembly were necessary in a democratic society. The Court held that the Commissioner's discretion to restrict public processions under the guise of "public order" was **not sufficiently tied to specific, concrete purposes** such as public safety or the protection of others' rights. The Court emphasized that the **necessity requirement** under Article 21 of the ICCPR requires that restrictions be **rationally connected to a legitimate purpose** and that they be **no more than necessary** to achieve that purpose. The Court found that the Ordinance's provisions failed to meet this standard, as they allowed for overly broad and arbitrary restrictions.

#### **Severance of Unconstitutional Provisions**
The Court held that while the concept of "public order" in the Ordinance was **unconstitutional**, it could be **severed** from the broader term "public order (ordre public)" to preserve the remaining constitutional provisions. The Court emphasized that the **remaining provisions** related to "public order" (in the narrower, law-and-order sense) were **constitutional** and could be upheld. This approach of **severance** was consistent with international jurisprudence, including the European Court of Human Rights and the Privy Council.

#### **Proportionality and Judicial Review**
The Court emphasized that the **proportionality test** is a key component of constitutional review in cases involving restrictions on fundamental rights. The Court held that the Commissioner's discretion to restrict public processions must be **subject to judicial review** and that the **proportionality test** must be applied to ensure that restrictions are **reasonable, necessary, and not arbitrary**. The Court also emphasized that the **judicial review** of administrative decisions is essential to protect constitutional rights and ensure that the exercise of power is **accountable and transparent**.

#### **Constitutional Rights and Democratic Values**
The Court underscored the importance of **freedom of assembly** as a cornerstone of democratic society. It emphasized that the right to peaceful assembly is **closely linked to freedom of speech and association** and that any restriction on this right must be **justified by a legitimate and proportionate purpose**. The Court also highlighted the **positive duty** of the government to enable lawful assemblies to take place peacefully, which includes providing reasonable notice and ensuring that public gatherings do not disrupt public order or safety.

### 4. Anything Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable About the Case

This case is remarkable for several reasons. First, it represents one of the most significant **constitutional challenges** to the post-handover legal framework in Hong Kong, particularly in the context of **freedom of assembly** and **public order**. The case involved a **high-profile protest** against the conviction of an activist, which highlighted the tension between **individual rights** and **state authority** in a democratic society.

Second, the case is notable for the **severance** of unconstitutional provisions from a statute, a technique that is not commonly used in Hong Kong jurisprudence. The Court's decision to **sever the unconstitutional part** of the Ordinance while upholding the rest reflects a nuanced approach to constitutional interpretation and shows the Court's willingness to **protect fundamental rights** even when they are embedded in a broader legal framework.

Third, the case is significant for its **detailed analysis** of the **proportionality test** and the **necessity requirement** in the context of restrictions on fundamental rights. The Court's reasoning reflects a **modern, rights-based approach** to constitutional review, aligning with international human rights standards and emphasizing the **importance of legal certainty** and **judicial oversight** in the exercise of state power.

Finally, the case is remarkable for the **divergence of opinions** within the Court. While the majority held that the Ordinance's provisions were unconstitutional, **Justice Bokhary** dissented, arguing that the provisions were **sufficiently clear and necessary** to maintain public order. This **divergence of views** highlights the **complexity** of balancing individual rights with public interests in a democratic society. [end of text]
