**1. Briefly summarize the facts of the case:**

The case involves a dispute over the validity of a will left by Nina Wang, a wealthy businesswoman who died in 2007. The plaintiff, Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd, claims that the will dated 2002, which leaves her entire estate to the foundation, is valid. The first defendant, Chan Chun Chuen, claims that the 2002 will is invalid and that a later will dated 2006, which leaves her estate to him, is the genuine will. The first defendant alleges that he and Nina Wang had a romantic relationship and that she had told him that she wanted to leave her estate to him. However, the court finds that the 2006 will is a forgery and that the first defendant had fabricated the relationship with Nina Wang to gain control of her estate.

The court also finds that the first defendant had a history of dishonesty and had previously been involved in a similar case involving Nina Wang's husband's will. The court notes that the first defendant had received substantial sums of money from Nina Wang and had invested in a company set up by him. The court also finds that the attesting witnesses to the 2006 will, Winfield Wong and Ng Shung Mo, had given inconsistent evidence and that their testimony was unreliable.

The court further finds that the signature of Nina Wang on the 2006 will was a highly skilled simulation and that the signatures of the attesting witnesses were not genuine. The court concludes that the 2006 will is a forgery and that the first defendant's claims are baseless.

**2. Briefly summarize the arguments of the two parties:**

The plaintiff, Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd, argues that the 2002 will is valid and that the first defendant's claims are an attempt to defraud the estate. The plaintiff argues that the first defendant had a history of dishonesty and had fabricated the relationship with Nina Wang to gain control of her estate. The plaintiff also argues that the attesting witnesses to the 2006 will were unreliable and that their testimony was inconsistent.

The first defendant, Chan Chun Chuen, argues that the 2006 will is the genuine will and that the 2002 will is invalid. The first defendant claims that he and Nina Wang had a romantic relationship and that she had told him that she wanted to leave her estate to him. The first defendant argues that the attesting witnesses to the 2006 will were credible and that their testimony was reliable. The first defendant also argues that the signature of Nina Wang on the 2006 will was genuine and that the signatures of the attesting witnesses were authentic.

**3. Summarize the legal principles (ratio decidendi) of the case:**

The case involves several novel and controversial legal principles, including:

* The court's approach to evaluating expert evidence in handwriting identification cases. The court held that the expert's approach should be based on a thorough examination of the evidence and a consideration of the inherent probabilities and improbabilities. The court also held that the expert's conclusions should be based on a comparison of the questioned signature with a sufficient number of comparison signatures to establish a reliable range of variation.
* The court's approach to determining the authenticity of a will. The court held that the authenticity of a will should be determined by considering the evidence of the attesting witnesses, the signature of the testator, and the circumstances surrounding the execution of the will.
* The court's approach to evaluating the credibility of witnesses. The court held that the credibility of a witness should be evaluated based on their demeanor, their consistency, and their reliability. The court also held that a witness's credibility can be impeached by showing that they have a history of dishonesty or that they have given inconsistent testimony.
* The court's approach to determining the validity of a will in the face of conflicting expert evidence. The court held that the validity of a will should be determined by considering the evidence of the experts and evaluating their conclusions based on the inherent probabilities and improbabilities.
* The court's approach to awarding costs in a case where the defendant has been found to have acted dishonestly. The court held that costs should be awarded on an indemnity basis where the defendant has acted dishonestly and has abused the process of the court.

The court's decision in this case highlights the importance of a thorough and careful evaluation of the evidence in handwriting identification cases and the need for a court to consider the inherent probabilities and improbabilities in determining the authenticity of a will. The case also highlights the importance of evaluating the credibility of witnesses and the need for a court to consider the evidence of the attesting witnesses, the signature of the testator, and the circumstances surrounding the execution of the will in determining the validity of a will.

The court's approach to awarding costs in this case is also noteworthy. The court held that costs should be awarded on an indemnity basis where the defendant has acted dishonestly and has abused the process of the court. This approach is consistent with the principle that a party who has acted dishonestly and has abused the process of the court should not be allowed to benefit from their wrongdoing.

In terms of novel or controversial legal principles, the case highlights the following:

* The use of statistical analysis in handwriting identification cases. The court held that the expert's use of statistical analysis to evaluate the rarity of certain features in the questioned signature was a valid approach.
* The concept of "rarities" in handwriting identification. The court held that a "rarity" is a feature that occurs not through accident but during the normal writing process that is rarely or seldom to be found in the specimen signatures of known authenticity.
* The concept of "accidentals" in handwriting identification. The court held that an "accidental" is a very unusual occurrence of a feature that may be the result of an external influence.
* The use of the "no-lose" argument in handwriting identification cases. The court held that the "no-lose" argument is a valid approach to evaluating the significance of a match between a questioned signature and a comparison signature.

Overall, the case highlights the importance of a thorough and careful evaluation of the evidence in handwriting identification cases and the need for a court to consider the inherent probabilities and improbabilities in determining the authenticity of a will. The case also highlights the importance of evaluating the credibility of witnesses and the need for a court to consider the evidence of the attesting witnesses, the signature of the testator, and the circumstances surrounding the execution of the will in determining the validity of a will.
