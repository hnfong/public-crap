### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts

The case involves two appellants, Stephen Chan Chi Wan ("Chan") and Tseng Pei Kun ("Tseng"), who were charged under the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (Cap 201) ("POBO") for allegedly conspiring to commit an offence under section 9(1)(a) of the POBO. The central issue was whether Chan, as an employee and agent of Television Broadcasts Ltd ("TVB"), had accepted an advantage (a payment of $112,000) from Tseng acting on behalf of Idea Empire Advertising & Production Company Limited ("IEAP") as an inducement to participate in a special edition of the "Be My Guest" talk show as part of TVB's New Year Eve Countdown Programme at Olympian City in 2010.

Key facts:
- Chan was employed by TVB as General Manager (Broadcasting) and hosted a popular talk show "Be My Guest."
- Olympian City (OC) and TVB collaborated on a New Year Eve Countdown show, with OC agreeing to pay TVB $1.3 million as a sponsorship fee.
- A segment of the countdown show was to feature a live "Be My Guest" episode with Chan interviewing a celebrity guest, Lai Yiu Cheung.
- OC contacted Tseng (IEAP's director) to arrange Chan's participation, agreeing to pay IEAP $160,000, which IEAP then paid $112,000 to Chan and $20,000 to Lai.
- Chan did not seek TVB's permission for this outside work, though TVB was aware of his involvement.
- The trial judge acquitted both appellants, but the Court of Appeal reversed the decision, convicting them of conspiracy.
- The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) allowed their appeals, quashing the convictions.

### 2. Arguments of the Two Parties

**Prosecution's Arguments:**
- The prosecution argued that Chan's participation in the "Be My Guest" segment was an act "in relation to TVB's affairs or business" under section 9(1)(a) of the POBO.
- They contended that Chan, as an agent of TVB, accepted an advantage (the $112,000 payment) as an inducement to perform an act (hosting the segment) that was intended to influence or affect TVB's affairs, specifically its ratings and contractual relationships.
- The prosecution emphasized that the act was "aimed at" TVB, even if the benefits were indirect or beneficial, and that the absence of direct prejudice to TVB's interests was irrelevant under the statutory interpretation.
- They also argued that the defence of reasonable excuse was not available because Chan failed to obtain proper authorization from TVB, and his belief that TVB would consent was unreasonable.

**Appellants' Arguments:**
- The appellants argued that Chan's participation in the segment was not an act "in relation to TVB's affairs or business" because it was a personal moonlighting activity as a celebrity, not related to his official duties at TVB.
- They contended that the payment was not an inducement to act in TVB's affairs but was simply compensation for his services as a celebrity, unrelated to his role as an agent.
- They further argued that the defence of reasonable excuse should apply because Chan honestly believed that TVB would consent to his participation, especially since TVB was aware of and did not object to his involvement in the segment.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) of the Case

The case primarily revolves around the interpretation of section 9(1)(a) of the POBO, particularly the meaning of "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" and the mens rea requirement. The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) provided detailed and thorough analysis on several key legal principles:

**A. Interpretation of "in relation to his principal's affairs or business":**
- The CFA clarified that the phrase requires the agent's act or forbearance to be "aimed at" and intended to "influence or affect" the principal's affairs or business (para 36-39). This is consistent with the Privy Council's decision in *Commissioner of the ICAC v Ch’ng Poh* [1997] HKLRD 652.
- The Court rejected the Court of Appeal's broad interpretation that any act related to the principal's business, even if beneficial, would suffice. Instead, it emphasized that the act must have a nexus with the principal's affairs, such that it would influence or affect them (para 36-39, 66-69).
- The CFA distinguished between acts that are merely "related" to the principal's business and those that are "aimed at" influencing or affecting it. The latter requires a more direct and intentional nexus (para 36-39).

**B. Mens Rea Requirement:**
- The CFA reiterated that section 9 requires proof of mens rea for all essential actus reus ingredients (para 18-21). For the acceptance of an advantage, the agent must know or believe that the advantage was provided as an inducement or reward for an act aimed at the principal's affairs or business.
- The Court emphasized that the mental state of the agent is crucial, and the prosecution must prove that the agent intended the act to influence or affect the principal's affairs (para 20-21).

**C. The Mischief of the Ordinance:**
- The CFA highlighted that the purpose of section 9 is to suppress bribery and corruption by preventing agents from accepting advantages that could undermine their loyalty and integrity to their principals (para 55-58). The removal of the word "corruptly" from the ordinance does not negate the need for a corrupt purpose; rather, it shifts the focus to the nature of the act and its impact on the agency relationship (para 55-58).

**D. The Requirement of Prejudice to the Principal's Interests:**
- The CFA rejected the Court of Appeal's view that the act must cause prejudice to the principal's interests. Instead, it held that the act must be such that it would undermine the integrity of the agency relationship by injuring the bond of trust and loyalty (para 52-55). This includes acts that could damage the principal's reputation or breach confidentiality, even if no direct economic loss occurs (para 52-55).

**E. Reasonable Excuse Defence:**
- The CFA clarified that the defence of reasonable excuse requires the accused to prove that they had a genuine and reasonable belief that their conduct was authorized or permitted by the principal (para 71-73). The court assesses reasonableness objectively, considering the circumstances of the case (para 71-73).
- The Court noted that the defence is not available if the conduct is clearly outside the scope of the agent's authority or if the agent knowingly acts contrary to the principal's interests (para 71-73).

**F. Conspiracy and Burden of Proof:**
- The CFA addressed the issue of conspiracy under section 24 of the POBO and the burden of proof. It held that section 24 does not apply to conspiracy charges, as conspiracy is an inchoate offence at common law and does not involve a reverse onus provision (para 74-89). The prosecution must prove the conspiracy without relying on the reverse onus provisions of section 24.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case

Several aspects of this case are striking or unusual:

**A. The "Moonlighting" Celebrity Agent:**
- The case involves a high-profile television host, Chan, who was both an employee of TVB and a celebrity hosting a popular talk show. His participation in an external event, paid for by a third party, raised questions about the boundaries of his agency and the scope of section 9. The fact that his participation was beneficial to TVB (boosting ratings) added complexity, as the Court had to determine whether such beneficial conduct could still constitute an offence under the POBO.

**B. The Narrow Interpretation of Section 9:**
- The CFA's narrow interpretation of "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" is significant. It requires a direct nexus between the agent's act and the principal's affairs, rather than a broad or indirect connection. This approach limits the scope of section 9, ensuring that not every act by an agent, even if related to their principal's business, is criminalized.

**C. The Rejection of Prejudice as a Requirement:**
- The CFA's rejection of the need for prejudice to the principal's interests is noteworthy. It held that even acts that are beneficial to the principal, if they undermine the integrity of the agency relationship, can constitute an offence. This reflects a strong stance against corruption and the protection of the principal-agent relationship, even in the absence of direct harm.

**D. The Reasonable Excuse Defence:**
- The case highlights the importance of the reasonable excuse defence and the objective standard applied by the court. The fact that Chan's belief that TVB would consent was deemed reasonable, despite the lack of explicit permission, underscores the court's willingness to consider the agent's honest belief in such contexts.

**E. The Complexity of Conspiracy Charges:**
- The case delves into the intricacies of conspiracy charges under the POBO and the burden of proof. The CFA's clarification that section 24 does not apply to conspiracy charges is significant, as it ensures that the presumption of innocence is maintained in such proceedings.

**F. The Broader Implications for Employment Law:**
- The case touches on the broader principles of employment law, particularly the fiduciary duties of agents and the importance of trust and loyalty in the employer-employee relationship. The CFA's emphasis on these principles reflects a modern understanding of agency law, where the protection of the principal's interests extends beyond mere economic loss to include reputational and relational harm.

In summary, this case is remarkable for its nuanced interpretation of the POBO's section 9, its emphasis on the integrity of the agency relationship, and its careful balancing of the need to combat corruption with the protection of individual rights. The judgment provides a comprehensive analysis of the legal principles involved and sets important precedents for future cases involving agents and bribery. [end of text]
