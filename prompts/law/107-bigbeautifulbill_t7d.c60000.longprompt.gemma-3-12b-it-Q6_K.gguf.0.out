Okay, here's a breakdown of the bill, section by section, starting with Sec. 71101, adhering to your specified format.  Please note that this is based solely on the text you provided.

**Sec. 71101. Moratorium on implementation of rule relating to eligibility and enrollment in Medicare Savings Programs.**

This section places a moratorium on the implementation and enforcement of specific rule changes published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) on September 21, 2023, titled "Streamlining Medicaid; Medicare Savings Program Eligibility Determination and Enrollment." The moratorium lasts from the bill's enactment date until September 30, 2034, and specifically targets amendments to five sections of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations (406.21(c), 435.4, 435.601, 435.911, and 435.952).  The bill also allocates $1,000,000 for fiscal year 2026 to the CMS Administrator to support carrying out this moratorium and the related section 71102.

**Sec. 71102. Moratorium on implementation of rule relating to eligibility and enrollment for Medicaid, CHIP, and the Basic Health Program.**

Similar to Sec. 71101, this section imposes a moratorium on the implementation and enforcement of a CMS rule published on April 2, 2024, titled "Medicaid Program; Streamlining the Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program, and Basic Health Program Application, Eligibility Determination, Enrollment, and Renewal Processes." The moratorium extends until September 30, 2034, and applies to amendments made to various sections of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations (Parts 431, 435, and 447, and sections 457). No funding is specifically allocated for this section.

**Sec. 71103. Reducing duplicate enrollment under the Medicaid and CHIP programs.**

This section aims to reduce duplicate enrollment in Medicaid and CHIP programs by requiring states to implement processes for obtaining address information and sharing it with a system established by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. Starting in 2027, states must regularly obtain address information, and by 2029, they must submit this information (including social security numbers) to the federal system to prevent simultaneous enrollment in multiple states. The bill allocates $10 million for fiscal year 2026 to establish the system and $20 million for fiscal year 2029 to maintain it, and amends existing sections of the Social Security Act to facilitate these changes.

**Sec. 71104. Ensuring deceased individuals do not remain enrolled.**

This section mandates states to regularly screen Medicaid and CHIP enrollment records against the Death Master File to identify and disenroll deceased individuals. Starting in 2027, states must review records quarterly and disenroll individuals confirmed as deceased, with a process for reinstatement if an error occurs. The bill amends the Social Security Act to incorporate these requirements and clarifies that states can use other data sources to identify deceased beneficiaries.

**Sec. 71105. Ensuring deceased providers do not remain enrolled.**

This section requires states to check the Death Master File when enrolling or re-enrolling Medicaid providers, starting in 2028. States must also regularly (at least quarterly) verify that enrolled providers are not deceased. This aims to prevent payments to deceased providers under the Medicaid program.

**Sec. 71106. Payment reduction related to certain erroneous excess payments under Medicaid.**

This section modifies the process for recovering erroneous excess payments made under Medicaid. It allows for audits by both the Secretary and states, and waives a portion of the excess payments, up to the amount of the errors exceeding a 0.03% error rate. The bill amends the Social Security Act to implement these changes and clarifies the types of payments that are subject to this reduction.

**Sec. 71107. Eligibility redeterminations.**

This section mandates more frequent eligibility redeterminations for certain Medicaid enrollees, starting in 2027. States must redetermine eligibility every six months for individuals meeting specific criteria, including those enrolled under certain programs and those who are otherwise eligible for coverage equivalent to minimum essential coverage. The bill allocates $75 million for fiscal year 2026 to support these changes.

**Sec. 71108. Revising home equity limit for determining eligibility for long-term care services under the Medicaid program.**

This section revises the home equity limit used to determine Medicaid eligibility for long-term care services. It increases the limit to $1,000,000 and allows states to elect a higher limit for homes not zoned for agricultural use. The bill amends the Social Security Act to implement these changes and clarifies the application of the home equity limit.

**Sec. 71109. Alien Medicaid eligibility.**

This section restricts Medicaid eligibility to U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, Cuban and Haitian entrants, and individuals with Compact of Free Association status. It mandates that states only provide assistance to individuals meeting these criteria, beginning October 1, 2026. The bill amends the Social Security Act and allocates $15 million for fiscal year 2026 to support implementation.

**Sec. 71110. Expansion FMAP for emergency Medicaid.**

This section establishes a higher Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for emergency Medicaid services provided to aliens, ensuring it does not exceed the FMAP for such services. The bill amends the Social Security Act and allocates $1 million for fiscal year 2026 to support this change.
