## HKSAR v. Chan Ming Lok [2009] HKCFI 571: Analysis

### 1. Summary of Facts

On June 29, 2008, Chan Ming Lok was found in possession of a knife in a public place in Hong Kong (outside Cochrane Street). Police officers observed him walking around, appearing suspicious, and intercepted him. When questioned, Chan stated he carried the knife for self-defense, as he regularly traveled back to Shenzhen late at night where he perceived public order to be poor. He claimed he had brought the knife through customs multiple times without issue. He was charged with possession of an offensive weapon under Section 33(1) of the Public Order Ordinance. The magistrate convicted him, sentencing him to 6 months’ imprisonment. The case was appealed on both conviction and sentence.

### 2. Summary of Arguments

**HKSAR (Prosecution):** The prosecution argued that the knife was an offensive weapon as defined by the Public Order Ordinance, and Chan had no lawful authority or reasonable excuse for possessing it. They emphasized Chan’s admission that he carried the knife intending to use it for self-defense, even if that self-defense was anticipated in Mainland China. They highlighted the importance of maintaining public safety by discouraging the carrying of weapons.

**Chan Ming Lok (Defense):** The defense argued that the magistrate incorrectly applied the definition of “offensive weapon” under Section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance. Specifically, they contended that the magistrate relied on the knife being “suitable for causing injury to the person,” a category potentially invalidated by the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (BORO). They cited *R v. Chong Ah Choi* which suggested that the “suitable for causing injury” clause might be incompatible with BORO.  They further argued that Chan’s intention was solely for self-defense, and that this intention, coupled with the lack of imminent danger, should constitute a reasonable excuse. They also pointed out that Chan believed he was legally allowed to carry the knife, having brought it through customs previously.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The core legal principle at stake in *HKSAR v. Chan Ming Lok* revolves around the interpretation of “offensive weapon” as defined in Section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance (POO), Cap. 245, and its compatibility with the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (BORO), Cap. 383. The case doesn’t establish a new principle *per se*, but clarifies the existing understanding and highlights a potential constitutional issue.

**The Four Categories of Offensive Weapons:** The POO defines offensive weapons in four ways: (a) made for causing injury; (b) adapted for causing injury; (c) suitable for causing injury; and (d) intended by the possessor for causing injury.  The case acknowledges that the Ordinance, as drafted, includes these four categories.

**The *Chong Ah Choi* Suggestion and the BORO:** The crucial point of contention stems from the 1994 Court of Appeal case *R v. Chong Ah Choi*.  Bokhary JA (as he then was) *obiter* suggested that the “suitable for causing injury to the person” clause (category (c)) might be incompatible with the BORO. The reasoning behind this suggestion is that a broad definition of “suitable” could potentially criminalize the possession of everyday items that *could* be used to cause harm, even without any intent to do so, infringing on the right to personal liberty and potentially violating the principle of legality.  The BORO, as an enactment giving effect to international covenants on human rights, requires a more precise and circumscribed definition of criminal offenses.

**Acceptance of a Reduced Definition:**  Remarkably, the prosecution conceded during the appeal that only three categories of offensive weapons should remain: (a), (b), and (d). This concession effectively acknowledged the validity of the *Chong Ah Choi* concern and the potential unconstitutionality of category (c).  The Secretary of Justice did not argue for the continued validity of the “suitable for causing injury” clause, despite the fact that the POO had not been amended to reflect this understanding for over 14 years.

**The Requirement of Intent:** The case reinforces the importance of *mens rea* (intent) in establishing the offense of possessing an offensive weapon.  Category (d) – “intended by the person having it with him for use for causing injury to a person” – is the most legally sound basis for conviction.  The magistrate’s initial finding that the knife was an offensive weapon was unclear as to which category she relied upon.

**Self-Defense as a Reasonable Excuse:** The court affirmed that self-defense, in and of itself, does *not* automatically constitute a “reasonable excuse” for possessing an offensive weapon.  The defense must demonstrate *imminent danger* to justify the possession.  Chan’s claim of potential danger in Shenzhen was deemed insufficient, as the threat was not immediate or directly related to his presence in Hong Kong.

**The Importance of Voluntariness of Admissions:** The court placed significant weight on Chan’s voluntary admission to carrying the knife for self-defense. This admission was considered crucial evidence of his intent, even though he claimed the self-defense was to be exercised in another jurisdiction. The court reasoned that a person would not admit to carrying a weapon with the intention of using it against another person unless that intention was genuine.

**Rehearing on the Papers and the Standard of Proof:**  As the appeal was heard on the papers (meaning based on the trial record), the court had to consider whether the conviction should stand despite the ambiguity in the magistrate’s findings. The court applied the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and ultimately found that Chan’s admission was sufficient to support the conviction, even in the absence of a clear finding of intent in the magistrate’s written statement.



### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

Several aspects of this case are striking:

*   **The Prosecution’s Concession:** The most remarkable aspect is the prosecution’s concession that category (c) of the offensive weapon definition was likely invalid due to the BORO. This demonstrates a willingness to acknowledge potential constitutional issues and prioritize individual rights, even at the cost of potentially weakening the prosecution’s case.
*   **The Unamended Legislation:** The fact that Section 2 of the POO remained unamended for over 14 years after the *Chong Ah Choi* decision is highly unusual. It created a “trap for the unwary,” as the court noted, potentially leading to wrongful convictions based on a questionable legal definition.
*   **The Ambiguity in the Magistrate’s Findings:** The magistrate’s lack of clarity regarding the basis for her conviction – not specifying which category of offensive weapon applied – further highlights the problematic nature of the legislation and the potential for misinterpretation.
*   **The Focus on Intent in a Seemingly Straightforward Case:** The case underscores the importance of *mens rea* even in offenses involving the possession of potentially dangerous items. The prosecution’s success hinged on establishing Chan’s intent to use the knife, even for self-defense, and the court’s reliance on his admission is significant.
*   **The Jurisdictional Nuance:** The fact that Chan’s stated intention was to use the knife for self-defense in Mainland China, while not a complete defense, was considered relevant to the sentencing. This highlights the complexities of applying Hong Kong law to individuals with cross-border activities.
