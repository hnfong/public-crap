### 1. Summary of Facts

This case involves three consolidated appeals heard by the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) of Hong Kong in 1999, shortly after the handover of sovereignty from the UK to China. The appellants were Chinese nationals born on the Mainland of China who claimed to be permanent residents of Hong Kong with the right of abode under Article 24(2)(3) of the Basic Law (the "third category"). This category covers persons of Chinese nationality born outside Hong Kong to a parent who is a permanent resident of Hong Kong.

The specific applicants were:
*   **Miss Ng Ka Ling and Miss Ng Tan Tan:** Born in the Mainland in 1987 and 1989 respectively. Their father was a Hong Kong permanent resident. They entered Hong Kong on July 1, 1997 (the day of the handover) without going through immigration control.
*   **Mr. Tsui Kuen Nang:** Born in the Mainland in 1978. His father was a Hong Kong permanent resident. He also entered Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, without immigration control.
*   **Miss Cheung Lai Wah:** Born in the Mainland in 1989, out of wedlock. Her father was a Hong Kong permanent resident. She had entered Hong Kong earlier on a two-way permit and overstayed.

Upon arrival or reporting to the Immigration Department, the Director of Immigration refused to recognize their right of abode. The Director relied on the *Immigration (Amendment) (No. 3) Ordinance 1997* (the "No. 3 Ordinance"), which introduced a scheme requiring persons claiming permanent resident status by descent to hold a "one-way permit" issued by Mainland authorities, affixed with a "certificate of entitlement" issued by the Hong Kong Director, before they could be recognized as enjoying the right of abode. Since the applicants had not obtained these documents, they were treated as having no right of abode and were detained or ordered to leave.

Additionally, in Miss Cheung's case, the Director argued that because she was born out of wedlock and her parents never married, she did not qualify as a child of her father under the local immigration regulations, which required legitimation by subsequent marriage for a father-child relationship to exist.

### 2. Summary of Arguments

**The Applicants' Arguments:**
*   **Right of Abode:** The applicants argued that they clearly fell within the third category of permanent residents under Article 24(2) of the Basic Law. Consequently, under Article 24(3), they possessed an unqualified constitutional right of abode.
*   **Invalidity of the Scheme:** They contended that the No. 3 Ordinance was unconstitutional because it imposed a condition (the one-way permit) that effectively nullified their constitutional right. They argued that Article 22(4) of the Basic Law (regarding entry from other parts of China) did not apply to permanent residents, as they were not "people from other parts of China" but rather residents of Hong Kong returning to their home.
*   **Retrospectivity:** They argued that the retrospective operation of the No. 3 Ordinance (deeming it effective from July 1, 1997) was unconstitutional because it retrospectively criminalized their presence in Hong Kong prior to the Ordinance's enactment, violating the principle against retrospective criminal laws under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).
*   **Discrimination (Cheung):** Miss Cheung argued that the requirement for legitimation by marriage for children born out of wedlock to claim rights from their fathers was discriminatory and violated the principle of equality under the Basic Law and the ICCPR.
*   **Jurisdiction:** They argued that the CFA had the jurisdiction to interpret the Basic Law and declare the Ordinance invalid without needing to refer the matter to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC).

**The Director of Immigration's Arguments:**
*   **Article 22(4) Qualification:** The Director argued that Article 24 (right of abode) was qualified by Article 22(4), which requires approval from Central Authorities for entry from the Mainland. Therefore, permanent residents residing in the Mainland could not exercise their right of abode without the Mainland's exit approval (one-way permit).
*   **Verification Scheme:** The Director argued that the scheme requiring a certificate of entitlement was a reasonable and constitutional method for verifying a person's claim to permanent resident status.
*   **Validity of PLC:** The Director argued that the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC), which enacted the No. 3 Ordinance, was a legally constituted body, and thus the Ordinance was valid.
*   **Reference to NPCSC:** The Director suggested that because the case involved the relationship between the Central Authorities and the Region (Article 22(4)), the CFA was obliged to refer the interpretation of the Basic Law to the NPCSC.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**A. The Constitutional Jurisdiction of Hong Kong Courts**
The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) unequivocally established that the courts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) have the jurisdiction and duty to examine whether legislation enacted by the HKSAR legislature or acts of the Central Authorities (National People's Congress or its Standing Committee) are consistent with the Basic Law. If such inconsistency is found, the courts are bound to declare the law or act invalid to the extent of the inconsistency. This power is derived from the Basic Law itself, which acts as the constitution of the Region. The Court rejected the previous view (from *HKSAR v Ma Wai Kwan David*) that courts could not question the validity of acts of the Sovereign (the NPC). The Court clarified that while the NPC is the highest organ of state power, the Basic Law is the supreme law of the Region, and the courts must enforce it.

**B. The Test for Referencing the NPCSC (Article 158)**
A critical and novel principle was established regarding the interpretation of Article 158 of the Basic Law, which governs the relationship between the CFA and the NPCSC regarding interpretation.
*   **The Classification Condition:** The CFA must determine if the provision in question concerns "affairs which are the responsibility of the Central People's Government" or "the relationship between the Central Authorities and the Region" (excluded provisions).
*   **The Necessity Condition:** The CFA must determine if it *needs* to interpret such an excluded provision to decide the case, and if such interpretation will affect the judgment.
*   **The "Substance" Test:** The Court introduced a crucial test: If the provision that is the *predominant* subject of the interpretation is a non-excluded provision (within the Region's autonomy), the CFA does not need to refer the matter to the NPCSC, even if an excluded provision is relevant to the context or qualification of the main provision.
*   **Application:** In this case, the CFA held that the predominant provision was Article 24 (right of abode), which is within the Region's autonomy. Although Article 22(4) (Central Authorities' relationship) was relevant to the Director's argument, the Court did not need to interpret Article 22(4) to decide the case; it only needed to interpret Article 24. Therefore, no reference to the NPCSC was required.

**C. Interpretation of the Right of Abode (Article 24 vs. Article 22(4))**
The Court adopted a "generous" and purposive approach to interpreting the fundamental rights in Chapter III of the Basic Law.
*   **Definition of "People from Other Parts of China":** The Court held that permanent residents of Hong Kong, even if residing in the Mainland, are *not* "people from other parts of China" within the meaning of Article 22(4). They are permanent residents of Hong Kong. Therefore, Article 22(4) does not apply to them.
*   **Unqualified Right:** Article 24(3) confers an unqualified right of abode on permanent residents. The requirement of a one-way permit (Mainland exit approval) to exercise this right was held to be unconstitutional as it subjected a constitutional right to the discretionary control of the Central Authorities, which was not intended by the Basic Law.
*   **Verification vs. Condition:** The Court distinguished between the *right* itself and the *verification* of the right. While the requirement of a one-way permit was unconstitutional, the scheme requiring a "certificate of entitlement" to *verify* a claim to permanent resident status was constitutional. The state has a legitimate interest in verifying claims to prevent abuse, provided the verification process does not deny the right itself.

**D. Retrospectivity and Criminal Offences**
The Court ruled that the retrospective provision in the No. 3 Ordinance (deeming it effective from July 1, 1997) was unconstitutional.
*   **ICCPR Application:** Relying on Article 39 of the Basic Law, which incorporates the ICCPR, the Court held that Article 15(1) of the ICCPR (prohibition on retrospective criminal laws) renders a statutory provision invalid if it retrospectively creates criminal liability.
*   **Consequence:** Since the retrospective operation would have meant that the applicants, who had a constitutional right to be in Hong Kong before the Ordinance, were retrospectively treated as illegal immigrants and potentially liable for criminal offences, the retrospective provision was severed.

**E. Discrimination and Children Born Out of Wedlock**
Regarding Miss Cheung, the Court applied the principle of equality found in the Basic Law and the ICCPR.
*   **Plain Meaning:** The Court held that the phrase "born of... residents" in Article 24(2) naturally includes children born out of wedlock. There is no distinction in the Basic Law between legitimate and illegitimate children regarding descent.
*   **Unconstitutional Discrimination:** The local regulation requiring legitimation by marriage for a father-child relationship to exist was held to be unconstitutional discrimination. It treated children born out of wedlock differently from those born in wedlock and treated fathers differently from mothers. The Court severed the words "subsequently legitimated by the marriage of his parents" from the regulation, effectively recognizing the father-child relationship regardless of marital status.

**F. Validity of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC)**
The Court upheld the legality of the PLC. It reasoned that the PLC was established by the Preparatory Committee pursuant to the 1990 Decision of the NPC, which was authorized by the Basic Law. The PLC was an interim body created to fill a legislative vacuum caused by the failure of the "through train" (the transition of the pre-1997 legislature). Its establishment was consistent with the Basic Law and the 1990 Decision, and thus the laws it enacted (including the No. 3 Ordinance) were valid, subject to the constitutional challenges regarding their content.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

*   **The "Substance" Test for References:** The most legally significant and novel aspect of this case is the "substance" test for determining when the CFA must refer a case to the NPCSC. By ruling that the CFA does not need to refer a case just because an "excluded provision" (like Article 22(4)) is *relevant* to the interpretation of a non-excluded provision (like Article 24), the Court preserved a significant degree of judicial autonomy. This prevented the NPCSC from having to interpret every Basic Law case that touched upon central authority issues, thereby protecting the "high degree of autonomy" promised to Hong Kong.
*   **Judicial Review of the Sovereign:** The case is remarkable for the Court's bold assertion that Hong Kong courts have the power to review the constitutionality of acts of the National People's Congress (the Sovereign). While the Court stopped short of actually striking down an NPC act in this specific instance (as the issue was about local legislation), it firmly established the principle that the Basic Law is supreme and the courts are its guardians, even against the highest organ of state power.
*   **The "One Country, Two Systems" in Practice:** The judgment is a landmark in defining the practical limits of "One Country, Two Systems." By ruling that permanent residents are not "people from other parts of China," the Court effectively created a constitutional distinction that allowed Hong Kong residents to bypass Mainland exit controls when returning to their home. This was a massive shift in the demographic and social landscape of Hong Kong, potentially opening the door for hundreds of thousands of Mainland-born children of Hong Kong residents to claim residency.
*   **The "Certificate of Entitlement" Compromise:** The Court's nuanced approach to the verification scheme is interesting. It struck down the *one-way permit* requirement (which was a political control mechanism) but upheld the *certificate of entitlement* requirement (which was an administrative verification mechanism). This demonstrated a pragmatic balance between upholding constitutional rights and acknowledging the government's need to manage immigration and prevent abuse of the system.
*   **Immediate Impact:** The case had an immediate and profound impact on Hong Kong society. It effectively granted the right of abode to thousands of Mainland-born children who had already arrived in Hong Kong, leading to a significant increase in the population and sparking intense political debate regarding the "right of abode" issue in the years following the handover.
