Okay, here's a breakdown of the changes in each section of the bill, as requested, starting with Sec. 50101 and continuing through Sec. 50501.  I've adhered to the length and specificity requirements.

**TITLE V--COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES**

**Subtitle A--Oil and Gas Leasing**

**SEC. 50101. ONSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASING.** This section primarily reverses provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 related to onshore oil and gas leasing. It repeals the increased royalty rates and restrictions on noncompetitive leasing established by that Act, effectively restoring pre-IRA rules.  The Secretary of the Interior is mandated to resume quarterly onshore oil and gas lease sales immediately, complying with the Mineral Leasing Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.  Specifically, the law requires offering at least 50% of nominated parcels in states like Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Nevada, and Alaska, and conducting replacement sales if initial sales are unsuccessful (less than 75% bid on acreage).  The section also modifies the Mineral Leasing Act to require leasing of available lands within 18 months of an expression of interest, subject to resource management plans.

**SEC. 50102. OFFSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASING.** This section mandates a significant increase in offshore oil and gas lease sales. It requires the Secretary of the Interior to hold at least 30 region-wide lease sales in the Gulf of America region over the next 10 years, starting with one by December 15, 2025, and at least 6 lease sales in the Cook Inlet Planning Area in Alaska between 2026-2032.  Lease sales in the Gulf must use the same terms and stipulations as the 2020 Lease Sale 254, with a royalty rate between 12.5% and 16.25%, and a primary term of 10 years for leases in deeper waters.  Alaska sales will share 70% of revenues with the state beginning in fiscal year 2034.

**SEC. 50103. ROYALTIES ON EXTRACTED METHANE.** This section simply repeals Section 50263 of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which dealt with royalties on extracted methane.

**SEC. 50104. ALASKA OIL AND GAS LEASING.** This section focuses on accelerating oil and gas leasing in Alaska’s Coastal Plain. It requires the Secretary of the Interior to conduct at least four area-wide lease sales within the next 10 years, using the terms and conditions from the 2020 Record of Decision for the Coastal Plain Oil and Gas Leasing Program.  Each sale must offer at least 400,000 acres, prioritizing areas with high hydrocarbon potential, and the first sale must occur within one year of enactment.  Revenue sharing with the State of Alaska increases to 70% beginning in fiscal year 2034.

**SEC. 50105. NATIONAL PETROLEUM RESERVE-ALASKA.** This section aims to restore and accelerate oil and gas leasing in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A). It directs the Secretary of the Interior to resume lease sales under the existing program, offering at least 4,000,000 acres in five sales over the next 10 years, starting within one year of enactment.  The sales must use the terms and conditions from the 2020 NPR-A final environmental impact statement and record of decision. Revenue sharing with the State of Alaska increases to 70% beginning in fiscal year 2034.

**Subtitle B--Mining**

**SEC. 50201. COAL LEASING.** This section mandates the resumption of coal leasing activities. The Secretary of the Interior must publish environmental reviews and hold lease sales for qualified coal lease applications pending as of the enactment date or submitted within 90 days, prioritizing the highest value tracts.  The section also allows for the granting of additional approvals for previously issued coal leases to commence mining.

**SEC. 50202. COAL ROYALTY.** This section temporarily reduces the coal royalty rate to 7% for leases issued before, on, or after enactment, lasting until September 30, 2034, before reverting to the standard 12.5% rate.  It also provides a credit to lessees who previously paid advance royalties at the higher rate, adjusting for the difference.

**SEC. 50203. LEASES FOR KNOWN RECOVERABLE COAL RESOURCES.** This section requires the Secretary of the Interior to make available for lease at least 4,000,000 acres of known recoverable coal resources on Federal land in the contiguous 48 states and Alaska within 90 days of enactment.  However, it excludes lands within National Monuments, Recreation Areas, Wilderness areas, Wild and Scenic Rivers, Trails, Conservation Areas, Wildlife Refuges, and National Parks.

**SEC. 50204. AUTHORIZATION TO MINE FEDERAL COAL.** This section authorizes the mining of Federal coal reserves adjacent to State or private lands that are economically unminable without access to the Federal reserves. The Secretary of the Interior must authorize the mining of these reserves without substantial modification, based on previously approved mining plans.

**Subtitle C--Lands**

**SEC. 50301. TIMBER SALES AND LONG-TERM CONTRACTING FOR THE FOREST SERVICE AND THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT.** This section increases timber sales on both National Forest System and public lands. The Forest Service must increase annual timber sales by 250,000 board-feet each year from 2026-2034, while the Bureau of Land Management must increase sales by 20,000,000 board-feet annually over the same period.  Both agencies are also required to enter into at least 40 (Forest Service) and 5 (BLM) long-term timber sale contracts (20+ years) between 2025-2034.

**SEC. 50302. RENEWABLE ENERGY FEES ON FEDERAL LAND.** This section establishes a new acreage rent system for wind and solar rights-of-way on public lands. The rent is calculated based on the Per-Acre Rate, an Encumbrance Factor, and an Annual Adjustment Factor, increasing each year.  Capacity fees are also established, equal to the greater of the acreage rent or 3.9% of gross electricity sales, with a potential 10% reduction for multiple land uses.

**SEC. 50303. RENEWABLE ENERGY REVENUE SHARING.** This section establishes a revenue-sharing program for renewable energy projects on public lands, beginning January 1, 2026.  25% of bonus bids, rentals, fees, and other payments will be paid to the State, and 25% to the counties within which the revenue is derived. These payments are in addition to existing payments in lieu of taxes.

**SEC. 50304. RESCISSION OF NATIONAL PARK SERVICE AND BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT FUNDS.** This section rescinds unobligated balances from several sections of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 related to conservation programs.

**SEC. 50305. CELEBRATING AMERICA'S 250TH ANNIVERSARY.** This section appropriates $150,000,000 to the National Park Service for events and activities surrounding the 250th anniversary of the founding of the United States, available through fiscal year 2028.

**Subtitle D--Energy**

**SEC. 50401. STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE.** This section appropriates $218,000,000 for maintenance of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and $171,000,000 for acquiring petroleum products for storage, available through September 30, 2029. It also repeals the mandate for drawing down and selling oil from the Reserve.

**SEC. 50402. REPEALS; RESCISSIONS.** This section repeals Section 50142 of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and rescinds unobligated balances from several other sections of that Act related to energy and climate programs.

**SEC. 50403. ENERGY DOMINANCE FINANCING.** This section expands the scope of the Energy Policy Act of 2005’s financing program to include projects that support or enable the provision of reliable electric supply. It also appropriates $1,000,000,000 through 2028 to carry out these activities.

**SEC. 50404. TRANSFORMATIONAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE MODELS.** This section directs the Secretary of Energy to mobilize National Laboratories to curate scientific data and develop self-improving artificial intelligence models for science and engineering. It appropriates $150,000,000 through 2026 for these efforts.

**Subtitle E--Water**

**SEC. 50501. WATER CONVEYANCE AND SURFACE WATER STORAGE ENHANCEMENT.** This section appropriates $1,000,000,000 through 2034 for construction and activities to restore or increase the capacity of existing Bureau of Reclamation conveyance and surface water storage facilities.
