### TASK 1: Briefly summarize the facts of the above case.

The case is **HKSAR v. Wong Cho Shing and Others** (2019) HKCA 839. It involves seven serving police officers convicted in the District Court for assaulting a man, Tsang Kin Chiu, during the 2014 "Occupy Central" protests in Hong Kong. The assault occurred outside a government substation after Tsang was subdued and handcuffed. The officers allegedly threw him to the ground and beat him while he was restrained. Two of the officers were also convicted of common assault for slapping Tsang in a police interview room.

The prosecution relied on open-source video and photographic evidence from media outlets (TVB, Apple Daily, ATV, Now TV) and police CCTV footage. The defense challenged the authenticity and admissibility of this material, arguing it could have been tampered with or edited. The trial judge admitted the evidence and convicted all seven officers, sentencing them to two years' imprisonment each.

On appeal, the Court of Appeal upheld the convictions for five officers (D1-D3, D5-D6) but quashed the convictions of D4 and D7 due to insufficient identification evidence. The court also reduced their sentences, finding the original sentences excessive.

### TASK 2: Briefly summarize the arguments of the two parties.

**Prosecution (Respondent):**
- The video and photographic evidence was authentic and admissible. The prosecution presented circumstantial evidence (e.g., Tsang’s testimony, police officer identifications, and the proximity of the footage to the events) to prove authenticity beyond reasonable doubt.
- The trial judge correctly applied the legal test for admissibility, requiring only a prima facie case of authenticity, not proof on the balance of probabilities.
- The convictions were safe because the judge’s identification of the officers was based on cumulative evidence (clothing, positioning, and continuity of presence) and Tsang’s identification.
- The sentences were appropriate, emphasizing the need for deterrence given the breach of trust by police officers.

**Defense (Appellants):**
- The evidence was inadmissible because the prosecution failed to establish its authenticity to the required standard (balance of probabilities or beyond reasonable doubt).
- The trial judge erred in admitting the evidence without proper foundation, particularly the open-source videos, due to lack of witness testimony from the original creators.
- The judge’s identification of D4 and D7 was unsafe as it was based solely on his own observations without witness corroboration.
- The sentences were manifestly excessive, especially for officers who did not directly participate in the assault and were under extreme pressure during the protests.

### TASK 3: Summarize the legal principles (ratio decidendi) of the case. Be detailed and thorough.

#### **1. Admissibility and Authentication of Video/Photographic Evidence**
The Court of Appeal reaffirmed the principle that video and photographic evidence must be **prima facie authentic** before it can be admitted. The test is not whether the evidence is authentic on a balance of probabilities (as the trial judge initially suggested), but whether there is **some evidence** (even circumstantial) that the material is genuine. This aligns with *R v Murphy* and *HKSAR v Lee Chi Fai*, where the court emphasized that authentication is a threshold issue for the judge, not the ultimate issue of credibility for the jury.

- **Key principle**: The judge must determine if the evidence is relevant and has a prima facie basis of authenticity. If so, it is admissible, and the jury decides its weight and credibility.
- **Application**: The Court upheld the admission of all video and photographic evidence, finding that circumstantial evidence (e.g., Tsang’s identification, consistency with other footage, and lack of tampering indicators) was sufficient to establish authenticity.

#### **2. Identification of Appellants**
The Court stressed that **identification must be based on witness testimony or cumulative evidence** showing continuity of presence. The trial judge’s identification of D4 and D7 was flawed because it relied solely on his own observations without witness corroboration. 

- **Key principle**: A judge’s identification of a defendant from video/photographic evidence is only safe if:
  1. The defendant is identified by a witness in the material, or
  2. There is other evidence (e.g., clothing, positioning) linking the defendant to the scene with continuity.
- **Application**: D4’s conviction was quashed because he was not a member of the QRT team and was never identified by any witness. D7’s conviction was also quashed because his presence at the assault was speculative (based only on his team membership and wearing glasses).

#### **3. Sentencing Principles for Police Officers**
The Court upheld the principle that **police officers must be deterred from abusing their authority**, citing *HKSAR v Hui Man Tai*. However, it found the trial judge’s sentences excessive, particularly for officers who did not directly participate in the assault.

- **Key principle**: Sentences must reflect:
  1. The seriousness of the offense (breach of trust, use of force on a restrained person).
  2. The officers’ roles (senior officers like D1/D2 were more culpable for failing to intervene).
  3. Mitigating factors (long service, stress during protests).
- **Application**: The Court reduced the sentences:
  - D1/D2: 18 months (from 24 months).
  - D3/D6: 15 months (from 24 months).
  - D5: 16 months (15 months for assault + 1 month consecutive for common assault).

#### **4. Chain of Evidence and Original Material**
The Court rejected the defense’s argument that the prosecution violated the **best evidence rule** by not producing original video recordings. It cited *Kajala v Noble* and *R v Murphy*, stating that the best evidence rule does not apply to video recordings; copies are admissible if their authenticity is proven.

- **Key principle**: The prosecution does not need to produce originals if copies are proven authentic. The focus is on relevance and authenticity, not the form of evidence.
- **Application**: The Court found no unfairness in admitting copies, as the authenticity was established through circumstantial evidence (e.g., TVB’s internal procedures, Tsang’s identification).

#### **5. Judicial Discretion in Admitting Evidence**
The Court upheld the trial judge’s discretion to admit evidence, even if some material was edited (e.g., the 49-second "blocked shot" in TVB footage). The judge’s analysis was thorough, and the Court found no error in his approach.

- **Key principle**: Judges must carefully assess the authenticity of edited footage, but minor edits (e.g., removing irrelevant segments) do not render evidence inadmissible if the core events are preserved.
- **Application**: The Court accepted the TVB footage as authentic despite the missing segment, as the sequence of events was clear and Tsang’s testimony confirmed the context.

### TASK 4: Is there anything striking, unusual or remarkable about the case?

Yes, several aspects are striking:

1. **Heavy Sentences for Police Officers**: The original 2-year sentences were unusually harsh for assault causing actual bodily harm, reflecting the court’s emphasis on deterring police misconduct. The reduction on appeal still resulted in significant prison time (15-18 months).

2. **Reliance on Open-Source Material**: The case hinged on evidence from media outlets (TVB, Apple Daily, etc.), which was not originally created for legal proceedings. The Court’s acceptance of this material, despite challenges to its authenticity, highlights the evolving role of digital evidence in criminal trials.

3. **Judge’s Independent Identification**: The trial judge made his own identification of D4 and D7 without witness corroboration, a rare and controversial step. This was later criticized as unsafe, leading to their convictions being quashed.

4. **Complexity of Identification**: The case involved multiple officers and video angles, requiring meticulous analysis of clothing, positioning, and continuity. The Court’s detailed scrutiny underscores the difficulty of identifying individuals in chaotic protest scenes.

5. **Impact of the Occupy Central Movement**: The case occurred during a politically charged period in Hong Kong, and the court explicitly acknowledged the "immense stress" on police officers. However, it still condemned the assault as unacceptable, balancing public order concerns with legal accountability. [end of text]
