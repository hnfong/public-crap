Okay, let's tackle this case summary. First, I need to go through the provided judgment and extract the key facts. The case is Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v. Chan Chun Chuen, a probate dispute over two wills of Nina Wang, the chairwoman of the Chinachem Group. The main issue is whether the 2006 will, which favors the defendant, is a forgery.

Starting with the facts: Nina Wang had a valid 2002 will leaving her estate to the plaintiff, a charitable foundation. After her death in 2007, the defendant produced a 2006 will in his favor. The plaintiff contested this, claiming forgery. The trial judge found the 2006 will was indeed a forgery, based on discrepancies in the attesting witnesses' accounts and handwriting analysis. The defendant appealed, but the Court of Appeal upheld the decision.

Next, the arguments of both parties. The plaintiff argued the 2006 will was a forgery, supported by the witnesses' testimony and expert handwriting evidence. The defendant claimed the 2002 will was a "charade" and that the 2006 will was genuine, reflecting Nina's true intentions. He also argued the trial judge didn't properly consider inherent improbabilities.

For the legal principles, the ratio decidendi would focus on the burden of proof in will forgery cases, the evaluation of witness credibility, and the role of expert evidence in handwriting analysis. The court emphasized that the trial judge's findings were based on thorough analysis, including the attesting witnesses' testimony contradicting the 2006 will's authenticity. The handwriting experts' conclusions about the forged signatures were critical. The court also addressed the "inherent improbabilities" argument, stating that while such factors must be considered, the judge properly weighed them and reached a justified conclusion.

Controversial points might include the exclusion of certain hospital signatures in the handwriting analysis and the statistical approach to evaluating the rarity of features in the signatures. The court's affirmation of the trial judge's discretion in weighing evidence, especially expert testimony, is a key legal point.

Lastly, the striking aspects of the case are the enormous wealth involved (estimates around $100 billion), the clandestine relationship between Nina and the defendant, and the dramatic revelation of the 2006 will immediately after her death. The use of feng shui rituals and the defendant's fraudulent actions add an unusual layer to the legal proceedings.

### 1. Summary of Facts  
The case concerns a probate dispute over the validity of two wills of Nina Wang, the chairwoman of the Chinachem Group, a conglomerate valued at approximately $100 billion. Nina executed a valid 2002 will leaving her entire estate to the Chinachem Charitable Foundation (plaintiff), a charity she co-founded with her late husband, Teddy Wang. After her death in 2007 from terminal cancer, the first defendant, Chan Chun Chuen (a feng shui master and Nina’s clandestine lover), produced a 2006 will allegedly signed by Nina, which named him as the sole beneficiary. The plaintiff challenged the 2006 will as a forgery, while the defendant argued it was genuine and reflected Nina’s true intentions.  

Key facts include:  
- **Relationship**: The defendant had a long-term secret affair with Nina, despite being married. Their relationship involved significant financial transactions (e.g., $720 million in gifts to the defendant between 1993–1997 and $688 million payments shortly before her death).  
- **Witness Discrepancies**: The 2006 will was purportedly witnessed by solicitor Winfield Wong and employee Ng Shung Mo. Both testified that the document they witnessed was a partial will (bequeathing $10 million to the defendant) and not the full 2006 will. The judge found their testimony credible and concluded the 2006 will was a forgery.  
- **Handwriting Analysis**: Expert evidence indicated the signatures of Nina, Wong, and Ng on the 2006 will were forgeries. The Nina Wang signature showed "highly skilled simulation," while Wong’s signature was deemed inauthentic.  
- **Timing and Circumstances**: The 2006 will was revealed immediately after Nina’s death, despite the defendant claiming he had kept it secret. Scientific analysis revealed the document’s creases and ink inconsistencies.  

The trial judge ruled in favor of the plaintiff, finding the 2006 will fraudulent. The defendant appealed, but the Court of Appeal upheld the decision.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties  
**Plaintiff’s Arguments**:  
- The 2006 will was a forgery, supported by:  
  - **Witness Testimony**: Wong and Ng’s consistent accounts that the document they witnessed was a partial will, not the full 2006 will.  
  - **Handwriting Evidence**: Experts concluded the signatures on the 2006 will were forged, with Nina’s signature showing "rare" features inconsistent with her known writing habits.  
  - **Circumstantial Evidence**: The defendant’s secretive relationship with Nina, financial exploitation, and rushed revelation of the will posthumously indicated fraud.  
- The 2002 will was valid and reflected Nina’s longstanding charitable intentions, unaffected by litigation pressures.  

**Defendant’s Arguments**:  
- The 2006 will was genuine, reflecting Nina’s desire to leave her estate to him.  
- The 2002 will was a "charade" created to gain favor during litigation over Teddy Wang’s will.  
- The trial judge erred in:  
  - Disregarding "inherent improbabilities" (e.g., the logistical difficulty of forging a will with multiple witnesses).  
  - Overreliance on witness credibility (e.g., Wong’s testimony was inconsistent and biased).  
  - Excluding valid comparison signatures (e.g., hospital records) in handwriting analysis.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The case hinges on **will forgery**, **credibility of witnesses**, and **expert evidence in handwriting analysis**. Key legal principles include:  

#### **A. Burden of Proof in Forgery Cases**  
- The plaintiff bore the burden of proving forgery on the balance of probabilities. The court emphasized that forgery allegations must be rigorously scrutinized, but the trial judge’s findings were justified based on:  
  - **Witness Credibility**: The judge’s detailed analysis of Wong and Ng’s testimony, finding them reliable and the defendant untrustworthy.  
  - **Documentary Evidence**: The 2006 will’s physical inconsistencies (e.g., creases under signatures, duplicated unsigned drafts) supported forgery.  

#### **B. Evaluation of Expert Evidence**  
- **Handwriting Analysis**: The court upheld the plaintiff’s expert (Mr. Radley) over the defendant’s (Mr. Westwood), focusing on:  
  - **Rarity of Features**: Radley’s methodology treated "rare" features (occurring in <1% of Nina’s known signatures) as significant differences, even if within a "range of variation." This statistical approach was validated by Osborn’s principles, which recognize that an accumulation of rare features is highly improbable in a genuine signature.  
  - **Exclusion of Deteriorated Signatures**: The judge rejected the defendant’s argument that hospital signatures (showing poor pen control due to Nina’s illness) should be included in comparison samples. These were deemed irrelevant for comparing the well-executed 2006 will.  
- **No-Lose Argument**: Radley’s "no-lose" principle (where a large range of variation makes any match plausible) was accepted, as the defendant’s expert failed to rebut it.  

#### **C. Inherent Improbabilities**  
- The defendant argued the forgery scenario was implausible (e.g., the defendant preparing the document without Nina’s involvement). The court held the trial judge properly considered these factors but concluded the evidence (witness testimony, handwriting analysis) outweighed them.  

#### **D. Clandestine Relationships and Moral Considerations**  
- The court rejected the defendant
