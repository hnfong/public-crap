## W v. The Registrar of Marriages: A Summary and Analysis

Here's a breakdown of the *W v. The Registrar of Marriages* case, addressing your requested points:

**1. Facts Summary**

W is a post-operative male-to-female transsexual person who has undergone full sex reassignment surgery and now lives and appears as a woman. She wishes to marry her male partner in Hong Kong. The Registrar of Marriages refused to recognize her as a “woman” under the Marriage Ordinance and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance, effectively preventing the marriage.  W brought a judicial review challenging this decision, arguing she should be legally recognized as a woman for marriage purposes. The case involved extensive examination of the medical condition of transsexualism, the nature of sex reassignment surgery, and the relevant statutory provisions.  The case also touched upon the rights to marry and privacy as enshrined in Hong Kong’s Basic Law and Bill of Rights.

**2. Arguments of the Parties**

*   **Appellant (W):** Argued that the definition of “woman” should be broad enough to include post-operative transsexuals. She contended that denying her the right to marry violated her constitutional rights to marry and to live with dignity. She emphasized the psychological and social aspects of her transition and the medical procedures undertaken to align her physical body with her gender identity.  She also pointed to international trends recognizing transsexual marriages.
*   **Respondent (Registrar of Marriages):** Maintained that the statutory definition of “man” and “woman” refers to biological sex at birth.  The Registrar relied on the traditional understanding of marriage as a union between a biological man and a biological woman, emphasizing the procreative aspect.  They argued that changing this definition would require legislative action, not judicial reinterpretation, and that the courts should not interfere with established legal principles. They also argued that there was no consensus in Hong Kong society supporting a change in the law.

**3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The case revolved around a complex interplay of statutory interpretation, constitutional rights, and evolving societal understanding. The Court ultimately ruled in favor of W, but the reasoning was nuanced. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the key legal principles:

*   **Statutory Construction & the *Corbett* Approach:** The Court found that the relevant Hong Kong legislation (Marriage Ordinance and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance) was originally intended to align with the principles established in the UK case *Corbett v Corbett* (1971). *Corbett* held that sex for marriage purposes was determined by biological factors at birth.  The Hong Kong legislature, by enacting similar provisions, implicitly adopted this approach.  However, the Court acknowledged the limitations of this approach.
*   **The Incompleteness of Biological Criteria:** The Court recognized that relying solely on biological criteria fixed at birth was inadequate in assessing the sexual identity of a transsexual person.  It
