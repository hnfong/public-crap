Alright, let me tackle this user request. They want a summary of each section in the defense portion of a bill championed by Trump, starting from Sec. 20001. The user provided the full text, so I need to parse it carefully. 

First, I notice the bill is massive with 13 sections under Title II (Armed Services). Each section has detailed appropriations and policy changes. The user wants extreme conciseness: max 4 sentences per section, but must include specific entities, dollar amounts, and key details. No vagueness.

Hmm, the challenge is distilling complex military funding into bite-sized summaries without losing critical specifics. For example, Sec. 20001 has 16 funding allocations plus housing policy changes. I'll need to group similar items (e.g., "various quality-of-life programs" for multiple $100M+ education/childcare items) while calling out standout figures like the $2.9B housing allowance boost.

For policy-heavy sections like 20001(b)-(c), I'll prioritize temporary changes (e.g., the 60% housing investment cap) over procedural tweaks. The shipbuilding section (20002) is a monster with 36 line items - here I'll emphasize scale ($4.6B for a submarine) and cluster similar tech investments (AI, drones) rather than listing every sub-allocation.

User likely wants to grasp priorities: China-focused spending (Indo-Pacific Command), nuclear modernization, border security. I'll highlight those themes. Also noting oversight in 20012 shows accountability measures. 

Must avoid opinion ("Trump-championed" is neutral fact here). Since user said "recently passed" but the doc says 2025, I'll assume it's forward-dated legislation. 

Biggest risk is omitting something material, so I'll cross-check each subsection against the text. Time to distill like mad!
