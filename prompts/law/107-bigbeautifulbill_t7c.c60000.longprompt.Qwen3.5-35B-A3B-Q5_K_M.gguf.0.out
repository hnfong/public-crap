This change effectively ends the subsidy for used electric vehicles earlier than originally scheduled under the Inflation Reduction Act.

**Sec. 70502**
This section amends Section 30D(h) to terminate the new clean vehicle credit for vehicles acquired after September 30, 2025, rather than the previous December 31, 2032 deadline. It also removes specific clauses from Section 30D(e) regarding battery component sourcing and critical mineral requirements, effectively simplifying the credit's eligibility criteria while shortening its duration. As a result, the credit for new electric vehicles will expire significantly sooner, impacting manufacturers and consumers relying on these incentives through 2025.

**Sec. 70503**
This section amends Section 45W(g) to terminate the qualified commercial clean vehicles credit by changing the expiration date from December 31, 2032, to September 30, 2025.

The change specifically affects the installation of refueling infrastructure for alternative fuel vehicles, shortening the window for investment incentives by several years.

**Sec. 70505**
This section amends Section 25C(h) to terminate the energy efficient home improvement credit for property placed in service after December 31, 2025, rather than the previous 2032 deadline. It also modifies Section 25C(d)(2)(C) to redefine eligible oil furnaces and hot water boilers, requiring them to meet 2021 Energy Star criteria and be rated for fuel blends containing at least 20 percent eligible fuel. These changes restrict the types of heating equipment that qualify for the credit and end the program for new installations after the end of 2025.

**Sec. 70506**
This section amends Section 25D(h) to terminate the residential clean energy credit for expenditures made after December 31, 2025, instead of the previous 2034 deadline. It also removes specific percentage tiers from Section 25D(g), eliminating the 30 percent credit rate for property placed in service before January 1, 2033. Consequently, homeowners will lose access to the credit for solar panels, wind turbines, and other clean energy systems installed after the end of 2025.

**Sec. 70507**
This section amends Section 179D to terminate the energy efficient commercial buildings deduction for property where construction begins after June 30, 2026.

**Sec. 70511**
This section amends Section 45V(c)(3)(C) to terminate the clean hydrogen production credit by changing the expiration date from January 1, 2033, to January 1, 2028. This change reduces the duration of the credit for producers of clean hydrogen, limiting the incentive period by five years. As a result, hydrogen production facilities must begin operations and claim credits before the new 2028 deadline to remain eligible.

**Sec. 70512**
This section amends Section 45Y to terminate the clean electricity production credit for wind and solar facilities placed in service after December 31, 2027, while introducing strict restrictions on prohibited foreign entities. It defines "prohibited foreign entities" to include specified foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities, banning credits for facilities with material assistance from these sources if construction begins after December 31, 2025. Additionally, it denies credits for wind and solar leasing arrangements and extends the statute of limitations for errors related to foreign entity assistance to six years.

**Sec. 70513**
This section amends Section 48E to terminate the clean electricity investment credit for wind and solar facilities placed in service after December 31, 2027, while imposing similar foreign entity restrictions as Section 70512. It introduces a "material assistance" test requiring a specific percentage of domestic content for facilities starting construction after December 31, 2025, with thresholds ranging from 40 percent in 2026 to 60 percent after 2029. The section also denies credits for wind and solar leasing arrangements and eliminates the energy percentage increase for certain energy property.

**Sec. 70514**
This section amends Section 45X to phase out the advanced manufacturing production credit for applicable critical minerals, reducing the credit amount by 25 percent annually from 2031 to 2033 before terminating it entirely. It also terminates the credit for wind energy components produced after December 31, 2027, and metallurgical coal produced after December 31, 2029. Furthermore, it restricts the credit for eligible components that include material assistance from prohibited foreign entities and adds metallurgical coal to the list of applicable critical minerals.

**Sec. 70515**
This section amends Section 48C(e)(3)(C) to prevent the increase of the advanced energy project credit program's allocation, effectively freezing the funding levels. The amendment takes effect immediately upon the enactment of the Act, stopping any further expansion of the program's budget. This change limits the total amount of credits available for advanced energy projects, capping the program's growth.

**Sec. 70521**
This section amends Section 45Z to extend the clean fuel production credit to December 31, 2029, while prohibiting the use of foreign feedstocks and negative emission rates.

**Sec. 70522**
This section amends Section 45Q to restrict the carbon oxide sequestration credit by prohibiting it for specified foreign entities and foreign-influenced entities. It also equalizes the credit amounts for different uses of qualified carbon oxide, setting the base rate at $17 per metric ton with inflation adjustments starting in 2027. The amendment ensures that the credit is available for various utilization methods, including enhanced oil recovery and direct utilization, while maintaining strict foreign entity restrictions.

**Sec. 70523**
This section amends Section 56A(c)(13) to modify the calculation of adjusted financial statement income by allowing deductions for depreciation and intangible drilling costs to be taken into account. The changes apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, affecting the alternative minimum tax calculation for oil and gas producers. This adjustment reduces the taxable income base for these companies by recognizing specific industry-related expenses.

**Sec. 70524**
This section amends Section 7704(d)(1)(E) to expand the definition of qualifying income for publicly traded partnerships to include income from hydrogen storage, carbon capture, advanced nuclear, hydropower, and geothermal energy. The amendment allows these partnerships to avoid the unrelated business taxable income tax on these specific energy-related activities. This change applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, encouraging investment in diverse energy sectors.

**Sec. 70525**
This section creates a new Section 6435 to allow payments to individuals who remove eligible indelibly dyed diesel fuel or kerosene from a terminal.

This provision applies to fuel removed on or after 180 days following the enactment of the Act, facilitating tax refunds for off-road fuel users.

**Sec. 70531**
This section amends Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930 to impose civil penalties of up to $5,000 for the first violation and $10,000 for subsequent violations for using the de minimis entry privilege to import goods in violation of U.S. customs law. It also repeals the commercial shipment exception for de minimis entries, requiring all commercial shipments to be formally entered. These changes take effect 30 days after enactment for penalties and July 1, 2027, for the repeal of the exception.

**Sec. 70601**
This section amends Section 461(l) to make the limitation on excess business losses of noncorporate taxpayers permanent and adjusts the inflation-adjusted amounts to reflect 2025 and 2024 levels. The permanent rule applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026, while the adjusted amounts apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025. This change ensures that the loss limitation rules remain in effect indefinitely, preventing high-income taxpayers from offsetting business losses against other income beyond the specified thresholds.

**Sec. 70602**
This section amends Section 707(a)(2) to clarify the treatment of payments from partnerships to partners for property or services, removing the phrase "Under regulations prescribed" and replacing it with "Except as provided." The amendment applies to services performed and property transferred after the date of enactment, ensuring that such payments are treated as ordinary income rather than capital gains or other classifications. This change aims to prevent tax avoidance through the recharacterization of partnership payments.

**Sec. 70603**
This section amends Section 162(m) to apply the $1,000,000 compensation deduction limit to all members of a controlled group of publicly held corporations, aggregating remuneration for specified covered employees across the group. The allocable limitation amount is calculated based on the ratio of remuneration provided by each member to the total remuneration provided by the group. This change applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025, preventing companies from circumventing the deduction limit by splitting compensation among related entities.

**Sec. 70604**
This section imposes a 1 percent excise tax on remittance transfers made using cash, money orders, cashier's checks, or similar physical instruments, effective for transfers made after December 31, 2025. The tax is collected by the remittance transfer provider and paid by the sender, with exemptions for transfers funded by debit or credit cards or withdrawn from regulated financial accounts. This provision targets cash-based remittance services to increase revenue and reduce the use of unregulated channels.

**Sec. 70605**
This section imposes a $1,000 penalty on promoters who fail to comply with due diligence requirements for COVID-related employee retention credits and extends the statute of limitations for assessments to six years.
