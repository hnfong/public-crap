### 1. Summary of Facts

This case concerns an application for leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) of Hong Kong regarding the validity of the last will of the late Mrs. Nina Wang, a prominent businesswoman and philanthropist. Following her death in 2007, probate proceedings were initiated. The First Respondent, the Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd (the "Foundation"), sought a declaration that the 2002 Will (which named the Foundation as the sole beneficiary) was valid. The Applicant, Mr. Chan Chun Chuen, counterclaimed, asserting that a later Will dated 16 October 2006 (the "2006 Will") was valid and entitled him to the entirety of Mrs. Wang's estate.

The central factual dispute was the authenticity of the 2006 Will. The Foundation alleged it was a forgery. After a 40-day trial, Lam J found that the 2006 Will was indeed a forgery. The Court of Appeal dismissed the Applicant's appeal, upholding the trial judge's findings. The Applicant then applied to the CFA for leave to appeal, arguing that the case met the statutory requirements for an appeal "as of right" due to the high value of the estate, or alternatively, that it raised questions of great public importance or otherwise warranted the CFA's intervention.

### 2. Summary of Arguments

**The Applicant (Mr. Chan Chun Chuen):**
*   **As of Right:** The Applicant argued that the appeal involved a claim to property worth over HK$1 million, satisfying the second limb of Section 22(1)(a) of the Court of Final Appeal Ordinance. He relied on previous Court of Appeal decisions (*Wang Din Shin* and *Re Estate of Mui Yim Fong*) suggesting that a probate action where the winner takes the entire estate constitutes an indirect claim to property of sufficient value.
*   **Discretionary Leave (Important Question):** He argued that the CFA's practice of not reviewing concurrent findings of fact (findings agreed upon by both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal) should be abandoned, claiming no justification existed for this practice in the modern context.
*   **Discretionary Leave (Or Otherwise):** He contended that the Court of Appeal's judgment was so inadequate that it did not constitute "concurrent findings," thereby allowing the CFA to review the facts.
*   **Discretionary Leave (New Evidence):** He sought to introduce fresh police statements from a key attesting witness (Winfield Wong) which he claimed contradicted the witness's trial testimony, potentially proving a miscarriage of justice.

**The Respondents (The Foundation and the Department of Justice):**
*   **As of Right:** They argued that a claim for a declaration of the validity of a will is not a claim to a specific proprietary right or property. Furthermore, even if it were, the financial benefit was not "immediate" because the court would still need to construe the will to determine if it revoked the 2002 Will or acted as a codicil, meaning the value of the claim was unquantifiable at the appeal stage.
*   **Discretionary Leave:** They argued that the CFA's practice of respecting concurrent findings of fact is essential for the efficient administration of justice and the proper role of a final appellate court. They maintained that the Court of Appeal had thoroughly reviewed the evidence and that the findings were indeed concurrent.
*   **New Evidence:** They argued that the police statements did not actually contradict the witness's trial evidence regarding the crucial issue that the document was a "partial will" (and thus not the 2006 Will), but merely clarified the witness's memory of a conversation or reflected hypothetical scenarios posed by a lawyer.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**The Scope of "Appeal as of Right" under Section 22(1)(a)**
The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) provided a detailed and authoritative interpretation of Section 22(1)(a) of the Court of Final Appeal Ordinance, specifically the second limb regarding appeals involving property or civil rights of a value of $1,000,000 or more. The Court established that this provision must be construed narrowly, consistent with the trend in major Commonwealth jurisdictions to abandon appeals as of right in favor of a discretionary leave system.

The Court laid down a strict test for what constitutes a claim "to or respecting property" under this limb:
1.  **Nature of the Claim:** The claim must be to a particular property or a proprietary right. A mere claim for a declaration regarding the validity of a will is insufficient unless it directly translates to a proprietary right.
2.  **Indirect Claims:** While the statute allows for claims "directly or indirectly," the Court clarified that an indirect claim is only valid if obtaining the order sought would immediately entitle the appellant to the property without any further adjudication, assessment, or apportionment.
3.  **The Immediacy Requirement:** This is the most critical principle established in this judgment. For an appeal to qualify as of right, the order sought must have the *immediate* effect of conferring a financial benefit or detriment quantifiable at the time of the appeal. If the outcome of the appeal depends on a further legal or factual determination (such as the construction of the will to determine if it revokes a prior will or acts as a codicil), the financial impact is not immediate. Consequently, the value of the claim cannot be quantified at the leave stage, and the appeal does not qualify as of right. In this case, because the 2006 Will's construction (whether it was a full revocation or a partial codicil) was an unresolved issue, the Applicant could not claim an immediate financial benefit of a specific value.

**The Practice Regarding Concurrent Findings of Fact**
The CFA firmly reaffirmed its established practice, derived from *Sky Heart Ltd v Lee Hysan Estate Co Ltd*, regarding appeals against concurrent findings of fact (where both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal have made the same factual findings).
*   **The Principle:** The CFA will not interfere with concurrent findings of fact unless there is a "miscarriage of justice" or a "violation of some principle of law or procedure."
*   **Rationale:** The Court emphasized that the primary function of a final appellate court is to determine points of law of general public importance, not to act as a third tier of fact-finding. Allowing appeals on pure facts would lead to attrition, increase litigation costs, and disadvantage litigants with fewer resources. The practice serves as a necessary counterweight to the tendency of litigation to become a contest of resources.
*   **Rejection of Change:** The Applicant's argument that this practice should be abandoned was rejected. The Court found no reasonably arguable basis to change this policy, noting that the rationale (balancing access to justice with the efficient administration of justice) remains compelling. The Court also dismissed the argument that the Court of Appeal's judgment was inadequate to constitute concurrent findings, noting that the Court of Appeal had thoroughly examined the evidence and the inherent probabilities of the case.

**Admissibility of Fresh Evidence on Appeal**
The CFA addressed the Applicant's attempt to introduce fresh police statements from a key witness. The Court applied the principles from *Ladd v Marshall*, which require that fresh evidence must be: (1) not available at the time of the trial; (2) likely to have an important impact on the result; and (3) credible.
The Court found that the police statements did not constitute a "recantation" of the witness's crucial evidence. The witness had consistently maintained that the document he witnessed was a "partial will" (dealing only with a specific sum, not the residue). The police statements merely clarified that the witness had forgotten the full name of the beneficiary later on, or that certain comments in his trial statement were hypothetical scenarios suggested by a lawyer. Since the core finding—that the document was a partial will and therefore not the 2006 Will—remained unshaken and corroborated by other evidence, the new evidence did not create a risk of miscarriage of justice sufficient to override the concurrent findings rule.

**Novelty and Controversy**
While the principles regarding concurrent findings and fresh evidence were well-established, the CFA's rigorous application of the "immediacy requirement" to probate cases is a significant clarification. It effectively closes the door on using the high value of an estate to bypass the leave-to-appeal system in probate disputes where the construction of the will remains an open issue. Furthermore, the CFA's explicit observation that the "as of right" appeal system is an anomaly inherited from the pre-1997 Privy Council regime and should be reconsidered signals a strong judicial intent to move Hong Kong fully toward a discretionary leave system, aligning it with other major Commonwealth jurisdictions.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

**The "Partial Will" Nuance:**
One of the most remarkable aspects of the case is the pivotal role played by the specific legal definition of a "partial will." The entire fate of the estate hinged on the witness Winfield Wong's testimony that the document he signed was only a "partial will" (a specific gift without disposing of the residue). The Court of Final Appeal's detailed analysis of the witness's police statements versus his trial testimony revealed that the witness had not actually changed his mind about the *nature* of the document, but rather had forgotten the *name* of the beneficiary or was recounting hypothetical scenarios. This highlights how a seemingly minor discrepancy in memory (forgetting a name) can be spun by litigants as a major contradiction, yet the court's forensic examination revealed it to be inconsequential to the core finding of forgery.

**The "Winner Takes All" Reality vs. Legal Technicality:**
The case illustrates a fascinating tension between the "reality" of the situation and legal technicality. In the lower courts, it was acknowledged that the Applicant was in a "winner takes all" situation where the estate was worth billions. However, the CFA insisted that despite this reality, the legal mechanism of the appeal (the need to construe the will to see if it revoked the previous one) meant the financial benefit was not "immediate." This strict adherence to procedural technicality over the practical outcome underscores the CFA's commitment to the rule of law and the specific statutory interpretation of "appeal as of right," even in a case of immense public and financial interest.

**The CFA's Call for Reform:**
It is highly unusual and remarkable for a final court to explicitly state in a judgment that a statutory right of appeal (which the parties were arguing about) is an outdated relic that should be abolished. In paragraph 107, the CFA stated, "the time has come when the 'as of right' basis for appeals to the Court of Final Appeal should be re-considered." This is a rare instance of a court using a specific case to advocate for legislative or systemic reform, signaling a clear direction for the future of Hong Kong's appellate system.

**The Scale of the Estate:**
While not a legal principle, the sheer scale of the estate involved (Mrs. Nina Wang's estate was estimated to be in the billions of HKD) makes the procedural battle over a few paragraphs of witness testimony and the definition of "immediate financial benefit" striking. It underscores how high-stakes litigation often turns on the minutiae of evidence and procedure rather than the ultimate value at stake. [end of text]
