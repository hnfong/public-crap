### 1. Summary of the Facts

W, a post-operative male-to-female transsexual person, sought to marry her male partner. However, the Registrar of Marriages in Hong Kong denied her request, arguing that she did not qualify as a "woman" under the Marriage Ordinance and the Matrimonial Causes Ordinance. W challenged this decision through judicial review proceedings, contending that she should be legally recognized as a woman and thus entitled to marry a man. The case was initially dismissed at the High Court and the Court of Appeal, and W then appealed to the Court of Final Appeal.

W had undergone extensive medical treatment, including hormonal therapy, psychiatric assessment, and sex reassignment surgery (SRS), which involved the removal of her male genitalia and the construction of female genitalia. She had also been issued with a new identity card and passport reflecting her female identity. Despite these changes, the Registrar maintained that W did not qualify as a "woman" for the purposes of marriage under Hong Kong law.

### 2. Arguments of the Two Parties

**Appellant's (W's) Arguments:**

1. **Statutory Construction:** W argued that the Marriage Ordinance and the Matrimonial Causes Ordinance should be interpreted to include post-operative transsexuals as "women" for the purposes of marriage. She contended that the words "woman" and "female" in these statutes should be given an updated meaning to reflect contemporary understandings and medical advancements.

2. **Constitutional Rights:** W claimed that the refusal to recognize her as a woman for marriage purposes violated her constitutional rights under Article 37 of the Basic Law and Article 19(2) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights, which guarantee the right to marry and raise a family. She also argued that the right to privacy under Article 14 of the Bill of Rights supported her claim.

3. **International Consensus:** W pointed to the increasing international trend of recognizing transsexual marriages and argued that Hong Kong should follow suit. She cited decisions from other jurisdictions and the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in Goodwin v UK, which held that the UK's refusal to allow post-operative transsexuals to marry was a violation of the right to marry.

**Respondent's (Registrar's) Arguments:**

1. **Statutory Construction:** The Registrar argued that the Marriage Ordinance and the Matrimonial Causes Ordinance should be interpreted in line with the traditional understanding of "man" and "woman," which is based on biological criteria fixed at birth. He contended that the words "woman" and "female" in these statutes should not be given an extended meaning to include post-operative transsexuals.

2. **Constitutional Rights:** The Registrar argued that the current statutory interpretation of "woman" and "female" was consistent with the constitutional right to marry as understood in Hong Kong. He contended that the right to marry under Article 37 and Article 19(2) did not require an updated interpretation to include post-operative transsexuals.

3. **Social Consensus:** The Registrar argued that there was no evidence of a social consensus in Hong Kong in favor of recognizing transsexual marriages. He contended that the Court should not make a radical change to the law without clear evidence of a shift in societal attitudes.
