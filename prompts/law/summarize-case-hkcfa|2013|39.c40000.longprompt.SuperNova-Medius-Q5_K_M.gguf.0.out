### 1. Summary of the Facts

W, a post-operative male-to-female transsexual person, sought to marry her male partner. However, the Registrar of Marriages in Hong Kong denied her request, arguing that she did not qualify as a "woman" under the Marriage Ordinance and the Matrimonial Causes Ordinance. W challenged this decision through judicial review proceedings, contending that she should be legally recognized as a woman and thus entitled to marry a man. The case was initially dismissed at the High Court and the Court of Appeal, and W appealed to the Court of Final Appeal.

### 2. Arguments of the Two Parties

**Appellant (W):**
- W argued that she should be legally recognized as a woman for the purposes of marriage, despite her biological male origins.
- She contended that her sex reassignment surgery and subsequent psychological, social, and medical changes should be recognized by law.
- W claimed that the current statutory interpretation of "woman" and "female" in the Marriage Ordinance and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance is outdated and should be updated to include post-operative transsexuals.
- She also argued that the current interpretation violates her constitutional rights under Article 37 of the Basic Law and Article 19(2) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights, which guarantee the right to marry.

**Respondent (Registrar of Marriages):**
- The Registrar argued that the current statutory interpretation of "woman" and "female" should remain unchanged, as it is based on biological criteria established at birth.
- He contended that the right to marry under the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights should be interpreted in line with the traditional concept of marriage, which is between a man and a woman.
- The Registrar also argued that the Court should not make a radical change to the law without legislative intervention, as such a change would have far-reaching implications and should be left to the legislature.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**Statutory Construction:**
- The Court held that the statutory intent behind the relevant provisions of the Marriage Ordinance and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance was to adopt the approach in Corbett v Corbett, which defined "man" and "woman" based on biological criteria established at birth.
- However, the Court found that the Corbett criteria were incomplete and did not permit a full assessment of a person's sexual identity, especially in the context of post-operative transsexuals.

**Constitutionality:**
- The Court concluded that the current statutory interpretation, which excludes post-operative transsexuals from marrying in their acquired gender, is unconstitutional.
- It held that the provisions are inconsistent with and fail to give proper effect to the constitutional right to marry under Article 37 of the Basic Law and Article 19(2) of the Bill of Rights.
- The Court also found that the provisions impair the very essence of the right to marry, as they prevent a post-operative transsexual from marrying at all.

**Remedial Interpretation:**
- The Court held that a remedial interpretation should be given to the relevant provisions, requiring the references to "woman" and "female" to be read as capable of accommodating post-operative male-to-female transsexual persons for marriage purposes.
- This interpretation allows for the consideration of the full range of criteria for assessing sexual identity, viewed at the date of the marriage or proposed marriage
