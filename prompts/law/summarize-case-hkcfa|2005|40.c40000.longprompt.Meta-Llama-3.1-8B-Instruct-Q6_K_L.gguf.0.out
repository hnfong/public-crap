**Summary of Facts**

The case of Leung Kwok Hung and Others v. HKSAR (2005) concerns a challenge to the constitutionality of the Public Order Ordinance, Cap. 245, which regulates public processions in Hong Kong. The appellants, Leung Kwok Hung and others, were convicted of holding an unauthorized assembly and assisting in holding an unauthorized assembly, respectively, for participating in a public procession on February 10, 2002. The procession, which started at Chater Garden, proceeded along Queensway and up to Police Headquarters in Arsenal Street, where the participants demonstrated for about an hour. The procession was peaceful, but the appellants failed to comply with the statutory notification requirement. The Commissioner of Police had warned them of the consequences of their failure to comply, but they proceeded with the procession anyway. The appellants appealed their convictions to the Court of Appeal, which upheld the convictions. They then appealed to the Court of Final Appeal, which granted leave to appeal and certified the question of law: "Is the scheme which the Ordinance lays down for notification and control of public processions constitutional?"

**Summary of Arguments**

The appellants, represented by Mr. Martin Lee SC and Mr. Erik Shum, argued that the Commissioner of Police's discretion to restrict the right of peaceful assembly for the purpose of "public order (ordre public)" is too wide and uncertain to satisfy the requirements of constitutionality. They contended that the concept of "public order (ordre public)" is imprecise and elusive, and that the statutory scheme does not provide sufficient guidance on when the Commissioner can exercise his discretion to restrict the right of peaceful assembly. They also argued that the proportionality test, which is required to be applied in exercising the Commissioner's discretion, is not adequately specified in the statutory scheme.

The respondent, represented by Mr. Gerard McCoy SC, argued that the statutory scheme is constitutional and that the Commissioner's discretion to restrict the right of peaceful assembly is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order (ordre public), the protection of public health or morals, or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. He contended that the concept of "public order (ordre public)" is not too wide or uncertain, and that the statutory scheme provides sufficient guidance on when the Commissioner can exercise his discretion to restrict the right of peaceful assembly.

**Summary of Legal Principles**

The Court of Final Appeal held that the Commissioner's discretion to restrict the right of peaceful assembly for the purpose of "public order (ordre public)" does not satisfy the constitutional requirement of "prescribed by law" and is unconstitutional. The Court held that the concept of "public order (ordre public)" is imprecise and elusive, and that the statutory scheme does not provide sufficient guidance on when the Commissioner can exercise his discretion to restrict the right of peaceful assembly.

The Court also held that the proportionality test, which is required to be applied in exercising the Commissioner's discretion, is not adequately specified in the statutory scheme. The Court emphasized that the proportionality test is a critical component of the constitutional requirement of necessity, and that it must be applied in a way that balances the interests of society with the individual's right of peaceful assembly.

The Court further held that the Commissioner's discretion to restrict the right of peaceful assembly for the purpose of public order is rationally connected with the wider constitutional legitimate purpose of "public order (ordre public)" and is no more than is necessary to accomplish that constitutional purpose. However, the Court noted that the Commissioner's discretion is limited to public processions consisting of more than 30 persons on a public highway or thoroughfare or in a public park.

The Court also considered the concept of necessity in a democratic society and held that it is a freedom-friendly standard of necessity that must be applied. The Court emphasized that the concept of necessity in a democratic society is not a vague or subjective standard, but rather a standard that requires a careful balancing of the interests of society with the individual's right of peaceful assembly.

In addition, the Court considered the principle of legal certainty and held that it is an integral part of a long constitutional tradition. The Court emphasized that legal certainty is necessary to ensure that individuals have a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, and that laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. The Court also noted that the principle of legal certainty is not hostile to purposive statutory interpretation, but rather requires that the statute be interpreted in a way that is consistent with the Constitution.

The Court further held that the Commissioner's powers of prior restraint under the challenged schemes are insufficiently circumscribed to be constitutional. The Court noted that the purposes which the Commissioner's powers are meant to serve are not repugnant to free assembly, but that the concepts of national security, public safety, and public order are very wide and do not provide sufficient guidance on when the Commissioner can exercise his discretion to restrict the right of peaceful assembly. The Court also noted that the schemes do not specify the sort of conditions that can be imposed, and that the Commissioner's discretion is not limited to situations where ordinary policing cannot cope with the necessary objective.

The Court concluded that the Commissioner's powers of prior restraint are unconstitutional and struck them down accordingly. However, the Court held that the Commissioner's entitlement to notification of public meetings and processions is constitutional, and that the criminal sanctions in s.17A are unconstitutional and should be struck down.
