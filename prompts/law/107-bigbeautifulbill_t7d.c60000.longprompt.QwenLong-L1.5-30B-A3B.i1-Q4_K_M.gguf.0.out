Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a summary of every section in this bill, starting from Sec. 71101. They specified that for each section, I should give at most one paragraph with up to four sentences, be specific about parties, entities, and quantities, and keep it concise but detailed.

First, I need to parse the bill text provided. The bill is titled "An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of H. Con. Res. 14." It's divided into several titles and subtitles, with multiple sections under each. The user mentioned starting with Sec. 71101, so I'll begin there.

Looking at Sec. 71101: Moratorium on implementation of rule relating to eligibility and enrollment in Medicare Savings Programs. The section says the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) can't implement, administer, or enforce certain amendments from a 2023 rule until September 30, 2034. The rule is titled "Streamlining Medicaid; Medicare Savings Program Eligibility Determination and Enrollment." The specific sections of the Code of Federal Regulations affected are listed: 406.21(c), 435.4, 435.601, 435.911, 435.952. There's also a funding provision of $1 million for FY2026.

So, for the summary, I need to mention the moratorium period (until 2034), the rule being blocked (2023 rule), the specific CFR sections, and the funding. The user wants parties and entities specified, so HHS Secretary is the key party here. Quantities: $1 million for FY2026.

Next, Sec. 71102: Moratorium on another rule related to Medicaid, CHIP, and Basic Health Program. The rule is from April 2024, titled "Medicaid Program; Streamlining the Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program, and Basic Health Program Application, Eligibility Determination, Enrollment, and Renewal Processes." The affected CFR sections are listed in parts 431, 435, 447, 457. The moratorium is also until 2034. Funding is $1 million for FY2026. Need to note the entities: HHS Secretary, and the specific programs (Medicaid, CHIP, Basic Health Program).

Sec. 71103: Reducing duplicate enrollment under Medicaid and CHIP. This amends Section 1902 of the Social Security Act. It adds new subsections (a)(88) requiring states to get address info monthly and establish a system to prevent multiple enrollments. The system must be in place by Oct 1, 2029. Funding: $10 million for FY2026 setup, $20 million for maintenance. Also, conforming amendments to PARIS and managed care sections. Need to mention the key requirements: address info from USPS, managed care entities must transmit address data, and the system's purpose.

Sec. 71104: Ensuring deceased individuals don't remain enrolled. Amends Section 1902 to add subsection (a)(89) requiring states to check the Death Master File quarterly.

The Death Master File is from the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013.

Now, I need to summarize each section concisely. The user wants at most one paragraph per section, max four sentences, specific entities and quantities. Let me check each section to make sure I capture the key points.

Wait, the user said "for every section 'Sec. XXXX' in the Bill." So I need to go through each section in order, starting from 71101. Let me list them all to ensure I don't miss any.

Wait, the user provided the bill text, so I need to make sure I cover all these sections. Let me check if I have all of them in my earlier notes.

Yes, the sections listed in the bill are from 71101 to 71121, then 71201-71203, 71301-71308, 71401, 72001, 73001. So 25 sections total. Wait, let me count:

71401: 1

73001: 1

Total: 10+8+2+1+3+8+1+1+1= 35 sections. Wait, but the user said "for every section 'Sec. XXXX' in the Bill." So I need to summarize each of these 35 sections.

Wait, but the user provided the bill text, so I need to make sure I don't miss any. Let me check the bill's table of contents as given in the problem statement.

So that's 35 sections. The user wants a summary for each, starting with 71101. Let me go through each one by one.

Wait, but the user said "for every Section ('Sec.'), give at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences. Minimum 1 sentence." So each section gets one paragraph, max four sentences. Need to be specific with parties, entities, quantities.

Let me start drafting each summary.

Sec. 71101: HHS Secretary must not implement a 2023 rule (Streamlining Medicaid; Medicare Savings Program Eligibility Determination and Enrollment) affecting CFR 406.21(c), 435.4, 435.601, 435.911, 435.952 until Sept 30, 2034. $1 million FY2026 for implementation.

Wait, the section says "The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall not, during the period beginning on the date of the enactment of this section and ending September 30, 2034, implement, administer, or enforce the amendments made by the provisions of the final rule published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on September 21, 2023, and titled ``Streamlining Medicaid; Medicare Savings Program Eligibility Determination and Enrollment'' (88 Fed. Reg. 65230) to the following sections of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations: (1) Section 406.21(c). (2) Section 435.4. (3) Section 435.601. (4) Section 435.911. (5) Section 435.952."

So the key points: HHS Secretary, moratorium until 2034, specific CFR sections, $1 million FY2026.

So the summary would be: "Sec. 71101 imposes a moratorium on the implementation of a 2023 CMS rule (Streamlining Medicaid; Medicare Savings Program Eligibility Determination and Enrollment) affecting CFR sections 406.21(c), 435.4, 435.601, 435.911, and 435.952, prohibiting the HHS Secretary from enforcing these amendments until September 30, 2034. The provision allocates $1,000,000 for fiscal year 2026 to support implementation efforts, to remain available until expended."

That's two sentences. Good.

Sec. 71102: Similar to 71101 but for a 2024 rule (Medicaid Program; Streamlining the Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program, and Basic Health Program Application, Eligibility Determination, Enrollment, and Renewal Processes). Affects CFR parts 431, 435, 447, 457. Moratorium until 2034. $1 million FY2026.

It appropriates $1,000,000 for fiscal year 2026 to facilitate compliance, to remain available until expended."

Sec. 71103: Amends Social Security Act Section 1902 to require states to obtain address info monthly and establish a system to prevent duplicate enrollments. Deadline: Oct 1, 2029. Funding: $10 million for system setup, $20 million for maintenance. Also, managed care entities must transmit address data.

Summary: "Sec. 71103 mandates states to implement a system by October 1, 2029, to prevent duplicate Medicaid and CHIP enrollments by regularly obtaining address information from USPS, managed care entities, and other sources, requiring monthly data submission to a central system. It allocates $10 million for system establishment and $20 million for maintenance in fiscal years 2026 and 2029, respectively, and amends managed care contracts to require address data transmission."

Wait, the section says "for fiscal year 2026, $10,000,000 for purposes of establishing the system and standards... and for fiscal year 2029, $20,000,000 for purposes of maintaining such system." So the funding is $10M FY2026, $20M FY2029.

So the summary should mention those dates and amounts.

"Sec. 71103 requires states to establish a system by October 1, 2029, to prevent duplicate Medicaid and CHIP enrollments through monthly address verification from USPS, managed care entities, and other sources, with states submitting data to a central system. It appropriates $10 million for fiscal year 2026 to establish the system and $20 million for fiscal year 2029 to maintain it, and amends managed care contracts to mandate address data transmission from providers."

That's two sentences. Good.

Summary: "Sec. 71104 requires states to conduct quarterly Death Master File checks to disenroll deceased Medicaid enrollees, effective January 1, 2027, with immediate disenrollment and payment cessation upon confirmation of death, and reinstatement if misidentified.

Wait, let me check if all sections are covered. The user listed 35 sections, and I have 35 summaries. Each is one sentence, which is within the limit of four sentences. The user wanted specific entities and quantities, so I included HHS Secretary, states, specific dollar amounts, dates, etc.

Wait, for Sec. 71119, the summary mentions "Medicaid recipients (excluding specified groups)" but the section lists specific exceptions. However, the user said "be specific as to parties, entities, and quantities." The exceptions are listed in the section, but the summary can't list all of them. So the summary says "excluding specified groups," which is acceptable since listing all would be too long. The key point is the 80 hours/month requirement.

Similarly, for Sec. 71121, the summary mentions "standalone Medicaid waivers for home or community-based services (HCBS) starting July 1, 2028, requiring states to meet criteria like no increased waitlists and needs-based eligibility." The criteria are detailed in the section, but the summary captures the main points.

I think these summaries are concise, specific, and within the user's requirements. Let me check a few more to ensure accuracy.

Sec. 71115: The summary says "reducing the hold harmless rate for expansion states from 5.5% in 2028 to 3.5% by 2032." The section states: "for fiscal year 2028, 5.5 percent; for fiscal year 2029, 5 percent; for fiscal year 2030, 4.5 percent; for fiscal year 2031, 4 percent; and for fiscal year 2032 and each subsequent fiscal year, 3.5 percent." So the summary correctly states the reduction from 5.5% to 3.5% over the years.

Sec. 71116: The summary mentions "capping state Medicaid payments at 100% of Medicare rates for expansion states and 110% for others." The section says "100 percent of the specified total published Medicare payment rate" for expansion states and "110 percent" for others. Correct.

Sec. 71119: The section specifies "80 hours" per month, which the summary includes. The effective date is "not later than the first day of the first quarter that begins after December 31, 2026," which is Q1 2027. The summary says "effective January 1, 2027," which is accurate.

Sec. 71301: The summary says "eligible aliens, including lawful permanent residents, Cuban/Haitian entrants, and Compact of Free Association individuals," which matches the section's language.

Okay, looks good. Now, the user asked to start with Sec. 71101, so I'll list them in order as per the bill's table of contents.
