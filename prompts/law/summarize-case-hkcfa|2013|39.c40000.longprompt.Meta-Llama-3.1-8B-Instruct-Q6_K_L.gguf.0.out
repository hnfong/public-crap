**Summary of Facts**

The case involves a post-operative male-to-female transsexual person, W, who wishes to marry her male partner. However, the Registrar of Marriages has refused to recognize her as a woman for the purposes of marriage, citing the Marriage Ordinance and the Matrimonial Causes Ordinance. W has undergone sex reassignment surgery and has been certified by a medical authority as having changed her sex. She has also been issued with a new identity card and passport reflecting her acquired gender. The Registrar's decision is based on the Corbett criteria, which hold that a person's sex is determined by their biological characteristics at birth and cannot be changed by medical or surgical means.

W has brought a judicial review challenge to the Registrar's decision, arguing that she should be recognized as a woman for the purposes of marriage. The case has been appealed to the Court of Final Appeal, which has granted leave to appeal on the basis that the questions of great general or public importance arise on the appeal.

**Summary of Arguments**

The appellant, W, argues that she should be recognized as a woman for the purposes of marriage, despite being a post-operative male-to-female transsexual person. She argues that the Corbett criteria are outdated and should be re-examined in light of changing social attitudes and medical advancements. W also argues that the right to marry is a fundamental right protected by the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights, and that the statutory provisions in question are incompatible with this right.

The respondent, the Registrar of Marriages, argues that the Corbett criteria are still applicable and that W does not meet the criteria for being recognized as a woman for the purposes of marriage. The Registrar also argues that the statutory provisions in question are constitutional and that W's right to marry is not impaired by the provisions.

**Summary of Legal Principles**

The Court of Final Appeal has held that the Corbett criteria are incomplete and should no longer be accepted as the sole criteria for determining a person's sex for the purposes of marriage. The Court has also held that the statutory provisions in question are unconstitutional because they impair the very essence of the right to marry.

The Court has considered the European Court of Human Rights' (ECtHR) decision in Goodwin v UK, which held that the UK's refusal to allow a post-operative transsexual person to marry in their acquired gender was incompatible with Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The Court has also considered the ECtHR's decision in Sheffield and Horsham v UK, which held that the UK's refusal to allow a post-operative transsexual person to marry in their acquired gender was not a violation of Article 12.
