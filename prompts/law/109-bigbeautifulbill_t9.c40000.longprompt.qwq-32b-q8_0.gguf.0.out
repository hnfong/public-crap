Okay, let me tackle this query. The user wants a summary of each section in this bill, starting with Sec. 90001. They specified to be concise, up to four sentences per section, with specific details on parties, entities, and quantities. 

First, I need to go through each section provided in the bill text. The user mentioned the bill is from Trump and recently passed, so the context is important. The sections are divided into Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs subtitles. 

Starting with Sec. 90001: Border Infrastructure and Wall System. The key points here are the appropriation of $46.55 billion for FY2025, with funds available until 2029. The uses include constructing barriers, access roads, tech like cameras and sensors, and ground preparation. I need to mention the specific elements listed in the bill.

Next, Sec. 90002: CBP Personnel, Vehicles, Facilities. The appropriations here are broken into parts: $4.1 billion for personnel, $2.05 billion for bonuses, $855 million for vehicles, and $5 billion for facilities. Also, there's a restriction on hiring processing coordinators after 2028. I should note each funding category and the restriction.

Sec. 90003: Detention Capacity. $45 billion is allocated for adult and family detention. The standards are discretionary except for family centers, which are defined. Need to mention the amounts and the definitions.

Sec. 90004: Border Security, Tech, Screening. $6.168 billion for tech like AI, non-intrusive inspection, air/marine upgrades, biometric systems, drug interdiction, and commemorations. Also, a restriction on untested surveillance towers. Highlight the tech areas and the restriction.

Sec. 90005: State and Local Assistance. Part A has grants for drone detection, World Cup, Olympics, and Operation Stonegarden totaling $2.575 billion. Part B is a $10 billion fund for states to build barriers, prepare ground, detect illicit substances, and relocate aliens. Include the specific amounts and purposes.

Sec. 90006: Presidential Residence Protection. $300 million for states/local to cover extra costs for securing the President's residence, with eligibility criteria. Mention the amount and conditions.

Sec. 90007: DHS Border Support. $10 billion for general border support costs. Straightforward, just the amount and purpose.

Moving to Subtitle B: Governmental Affairs. 

Sec. 90101: FEHB Improvements. This section adds fraud checks, audits, and a $66 million fund for oversight in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Need to note the verification steps and funding.

Sec. 90102: Pandemic Accountability. $88 million for 2026 to oversee pandemic funds, extending the committee's authority to 2034. Mention the funding and extension.

Sec. 90103: OMB Appropriation. $100 million for OMB to find budget efficiencies. Simple, just the amount and purpose.

I need to ensure each section is covered concisely, with exact figures and specific entities involved. Avoid vagueness, so include terms like "U.S. Customs and Border Protection" where applicable. Also, check that each summary is under four sentences and meets the user's structure. Let me structure each section's summary accordingly, making sure not to miss any key points like restrictions or definitions.
