### 1. Brief Summary of Facts

The case involves four primary school teachers and a friend who were charged under section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200) for "obtaining access to a computer with a view to dishonest gain for himself or another." The facts are as follows:

- The respondents were teachers involved in the competitive admission interview process for a government-subsidized primary school.
- On June 13, 2014, they used various devices (smartphones, desktop computers) to photograph confidential interview questions and marking schemes provided by the school for the interview process.
- The respondents transmitted these photographs and documents to third parties via WhatsApp and email.
- Each respondent was charged with obtaining access to a computer (their own device or a school computer) with intent to gain dishonestly for another person.
- The Magistrate acquitted all four respondents, finding reasonable doubt about confidentiality awareness and lack of dishonest intent.
- The Secretary for Justice appealed, arguing the trial judge erred in law by limiting the actus reus of the offence to unauthorized extraction and use of information from a computer.

### 2. Arguments of the Two Parties

**Appellant (Secretary for Justice):**
- Argued that section 161(1)(c) should be construed broadly to cover any unauthorized access to a computer, including using one's own device to access information.
- Contended that the phrase "obtain access to a computer" should be interpreted to include any use of a computer, regardless of ownership, as long as the access is unauthorized.
- Emphasized that technology had evolved since 1993, and the law should adapt to modern computer misuse scenarios like phishing, identity theft, and clandestine photography.
- Argued that a restrictive interpretation would create a legal lacuna allowing many forms of computer misuse to go unpunished.

**Respondents:**
- Argued that section 161(1)(c) is limited to unauthorized extraction and use of information from a computer, not merely accessing one's own device.
- Contended that the actus reus requires unauthorized access to *another* person's computer or system, not just one's own device.
- Submitted that the legislative history and purpose of the section indicate it was designed to criminalize preparatory acts involving unauthorized access to others' computers, not self-access.
- Argued that interpreting the section to cover self-use would lead to absurd consequences and contradict the ordinary meaning of "obtain access."

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) dismissed the appeal, holding that section 161(1)(c) does not apply to the use by a person of their own computer, even with dishonest intent. The key legal principles are:

**A. Statutory Interpretation Principles:**
- The Court applied traditional statutory interpretation methodology: text, context, legislative history, and purpose.
- The ordinary meaning of "obtain access to a computer" was found to imply gaining access to something one did not previously have access to (para 38-39).
- The Court emphasized that statutes should be construed in accordance with their plain language unless ambiguity requires otherwise (para 37).

**B. Legislative Intent and Purpose:**
- The legislative history shows section 161 was created to address preparatory acts involving unauthorized access to *others'* computers (para 42-43).
- The Memorandum for Legislative Council and Second Reading debates indicate the offence was aimed at dishonest accessing of computers belonging to others, not self-access (para 22, 28-30).
- The deletion of a proposed interpretive provision that would have defined "access" broadly suggests Parliament did not intend to cover self-use (para 30-31).

**C. Actus Reus Requirement:**
- The Court held that the actus reus requires unauthorized access to a computer *belonging to another person* (para 44).
- Using one's own computer, even with dishonest intent, does not satisfy the actus reus because there is no "unauthorized access" to a computer one already owns (para 48).
- The Court distinguished between accessing one's own device and accessing another's system, noting the latter would likely fall under other offences (para 44).

**D. Policy Considerations:**
- While the appellant argued for a broad interpretation to cover modern cybercrimes, the Court declined to legislate from the bench (para 47).
- The Court noted that creating new offences is a legislative function, not judicial (para 47).

**E. No Precedent for Employer-Owned Devices:**
- The Court distinguished cases where an employee uses an employer's computer, noting such situations involve complex questions of private use rights not present here (para 33).

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

**A. Narrow Interpretation of a Cybercrime Provision:**
- This case is remarkable for how narrowly the Court interpreted a cybercrime statute intended to combat computer misuse. The Court explicitly refused to extend the law to cover conduct that many might consider clearly criminal (e.g., using one's own phone to send confidential information).

**B. Legislative History as Key Factor:**
- The decision heavily relied on the legislative history, particularly the deletion of a provision that would have explicitly covered self-use, suggesting Parliament's intent to limit the offence to unauthorized access of others' computers.

**C. Ordinary Language Interpretation:**
- The Court's emphasis on the ordinary meaning of "obtain access" as implying gaining access to something one didn't have before was unusual in modern statutory interpretation, which often favors purposive approaches.

**D. Concession on Employer-Owned Devices:**
- The Court's acceptance of the concession that a school computer could be treated as the teacher's own for this case, while explicitly stating this doesn't create precedent, was unusual judicial economy.

**E. Technology vs. Textualism:**
- The case highlights the tension between judicial textualism and the need to address technological realities. The Court refused to "read in" modern meanings to an outdated statute, prioritizing textual consistency over policy adaptation.

**F. No Precedent for Future Cases:**
- The Court's explicit statement that its decision doesn't create precedent for employer-employee computer use cases is remarkable, as such cases are increasingly common in the digital age.

**G. Academic and Practical Impact:**
- The decision has been criticized for creating a potential loophole where someone could use their own computer to access and transmit others' confidential information without violating this specific offence, though other offences might apply. This has been seen as a limitation on the effectiveness of Hong Kong's computer crime legislation.

The case is striking in its textual purity and refusal to modernize the law beyond what Parliament intended, even when the practical effect may seem to create an anomaly in the law's application to modern cybercrime scenarios. [end of text]
