Got it, let's tackle this. The user wants summaries for each Sec. XXXX starting with 80001, each 1-4 sentences, specific with parties/entities/quantities. First, I need to go through each section provided and extract the key points concisely.

Starting with Sec. 80001: Exemption of Certain Assets. The text amends HEA 1965 §480(f)(2) to add exemptions for family farms (where family resides), small businesses (<=100 FTE employees), and commercial fishing businesses/vessels/permit owned by the family. Effective July 1, 2026, for award years 2026-27 onwards. So need to mention the assets exempted, the amendment to HEA, effective date, and applicable award years.

Sec. 81001: Loan Limits for Grad/Prof Students and Parents; Terminate Grad PLUS Loans. Amends HEA §455(a). For grad/prof students: terminates subsidized Stafford loans (post-2012) and caps unsubsidized annual amounts (2026 onwards: $20.5k grad, $50k prof); aggregate limits ($100k grad non-prof, $200k prof with adjustments). Parents: caps annual PLUS loans at $20k/dependent student, aggregate $65k/dependent (post-2026). Interim exception for students enrolled by 6/30/26 for up to 3 years or program length remaining. Also sets lifetime aggregate limit of $257.5k for all students (excluding parent PLUS).

Key points: Transition existing income contingent loans to Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP) or IBR by 2028; new loans post-2026 have two plans: standard (10/15/20/25-year based on balance) or RAP. Excepted loans (parent PLUS, consolidation for PLUS) must use standard plan. RAP has income-based payments (1-10% of AGI, minus $50/dependent, min $10), 360 payments for forgiveness, interest subsidy, and matching principal payments (<$50/month). Repeals income contingent repayment (ICR) by 2028.

Sec. 82002: Deferment; Forbearance. Sunsets unemployment/economic hardship deferments for loans made post-2027. Forbearance for post-2027 loans limited to 9 months/24 months via §428(c)(3)(B).
