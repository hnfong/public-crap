Okay, I need to tackle this case summary. Let me start by understanding the case. The case is W v. Registrar of Marriages, which was decided in 2013 in Hong Kong. The appellant, W, is a male-to-female transsexual who has undergone surgery and now lives as a woman. She wants to marry her male partner, but the Registrar says she doesn't qualify as a woman under the Marriage Ordinance and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance. She challenged this through judicial review, but the first instance and Court of Appeal rejected her. The Court of Appeal allowed an appeal because of the constitutional issues.

So, the facts are that W has had sex reassignment surgery, including removal of male genitalia and creation of a female vagina, and has been recognized as female by the Hong Kong government. The Registrar, however, insists that only the biological sex at birth counts, so W can't marry a man. The key issue is whether the law should consider her as a woman for marriage purposes.

Now, the two parties' arguments. The appellant argues that she should be considered a woman for legal purposes, as she has undergone surgery and is living as a woman. She doesn't want same-sex marriage, just to marry a person of the opposite sex. The Registrar argues that the law requires biological sex at birth, and that the current statutes don't allow for legal recognition of post-operative transsexuals as women. The Registrar also mentions that the law is based on the Corbett case, which was a UK case where a transsexual was deemed not a woman for marriage purposes.

For the legal principles, the ratio decidendi is about statutory interpretation and constitutional rights. The Court of Appeal initially held that the statutes should be interpreted based on the Corbett criteria, which are biological (chromosomes, gonads, genitalia). But the majority of the High Court, including the Chief Justice, found that the Corbett criteria are outdated and that the law should be interpreted to include post-operative transsexuals as women. The key points are the shift from biological to psychological and social factors, the role of the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights in protecting the right to marry, and the constitutional requirement that the law must not impair the essence of the right to marry.

The novel or controversial points are the Court's decision to apply a more inclusive interpretation of "woman" in the statutes, considering psychological and social factors. Also, the recognition that the Basic Law and Bill of Rights require the law to be compatible with the right to marry, even if the statutes were originally based on traditional views. The Court also emphasized that the right to marry is a strong right that must not be restricted in a way that denies the essence of the right, which in this case means allowing W to marry as a woman.

What's striking about the case is the contrast between the traditional legal view of marriage as between biological men and women and the Court's decision to recognize the legal identity of a transsexual person who has undergone surgery. It's also notable that the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, but the High Court majority rejected the appeal, highlighting the importance of the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights in this context. The case is significant because it's one of the first in Hong Kong to address the legal status of transsexuals in marriage, and it's a landmark decision that could influence future legislation on gender recognition and marriage
