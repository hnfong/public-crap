**Sec. 71101**  
A four-year moratorium (2025-2034) blocks the Biden administration’s CMS rule that would have tightened Medicaid/Medicare Savings Program eligibility and enrollment. The rule’s key provisions—addressing Section 406.21(c), 435.4, 435.601, 435.911, and 435.952 of 42 CFR—are frozen nationwide.

**Sec. 71102**  
A parallel four-year moratorium (2025-2034) halts the April 2024 CMS rule streamlining Medicaid, CHIP, and Basic Health Program enrollment.

**Sec. 71103**  
By January 1, 2027, states must implement a monthly data-matching system to prevent duplicate Medicaid/CHIP enrollment, using Social Security numbers and other data. The system, funded with $10 million in FY2026, will cross-check enrollments across states and auto-disenroll non-residents.

**Sec. 71104**  
Starting January 1, 2027, states must quarterly purge deceased Medicaid beneficiaries using the Death Master File, automatically disenrolling them and stopping payments. States must also reinstate coverage if a death record is proven erroneous.

**Sec. 71106**  
Beginning FY2030, Medicaid overpayments exceeding a 0.03 % error rate are subject to recovery, with states allowed to conduct audits. The Secretary may waive recovery for excess payments up to the 0.03 % threshold, capped at the total erroneous payments.

**Sec. 71107**  
Starting in Q1 2027, states must redetermine eligibility every six months for certain Medicaid expansion adults, exempting those already subject to other federal redetermination requirements. The CMS will issue implementation guidance and $75 million in FY2026 funding.

**Sec. 71108**  
Effective January 1, 2028, states may raise the Medicaid home-equity limit for long-term-care eligibility from $500,000 to $1 million, with agricultural properties excluded. States can opt to apply this higher limit to non-agricultural homes as well.

**Sec. 71109**  
Effective October 1, 2026, Medicaid payments are barred for undocumented non-residents except certain categories (lawful permanent residents, Cuban/Haitian entrants, Compact-of-Freedom recipients). CHIP eligibility is similarly restricted, with $15 million in FY2026 funding for implementation.

**Sec. 71110**

Effective for applications on or after Q1 2027, Medicaid benefits are retroactive only one month for expansion adults (Section 1902(a)(34)(A)) and two months for others (Section 1902(a)(34)(B)). CHIP similarly limits retroactive coverage to two months.

**Sec. 71115**  
Starting FY2028, non-expansion states face a sliding-scale provider-tax hold-harmless rate that falls from 6 % in 2028 to 3.5 % by 2032. Expansion states get a lower, declining rate (5.5 % in 2028 down to 3.5 % in 2032+).

**Sec. 71116**  
Effective January 1, 2028, state-directed payments under Medicaid must align with Medicare rates—100 % of Medicare for states covering all expansion adults, 110 % otherwise. Rural hospitals get a four-year phase-down (10 % annual reduction) for prior approvals.

**Sec. 71117**

Starting Q1 2027, able-bodied Medicaid adults must document 80 hours/week of work, study, or community service (or meet income thresholds) to remain eligible. States may exempt minors, seniors, veterans, and others; non-compliance triggers a 30-day notice and potential disenrollment.

**Sec. 71120**

**Sec. 71121**  
Effective July 1, 2028, states may create standalone 1915(c) waivers to fund home- and community-based services (HCBS) for individuals not meeting traditional institutional-care criteria. Waivers last 3 years, renewable every 5 years, with strict spending and data-reporting requirements.

Direct primary-care arrangements with fixed periodic fees ≤$150 per individual per month are excluded from ACA market rules and treated as medical expenses for HSA purposes.

**Sec. 71401**
