## Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v. Chan Chun Chuen [2011] HKCA 13: Case Summary

### 1. Facts Summary

The case revolves around the validity of two wills made by Nina Wang, the chairwoman of the Chinachem Group, a vast private conglomerate. The first will (2002 will) bequeathed her entire estate to the Chinachem Charitable Foundation, jointly established by her and her late husband, Teddy Wang. The second will (2006 will) bequeathed the estate to Chan Chun Chuen, with whom Nina Wang had a long-term, secretive relationship.  

Following Nina Wang’s death, Chan produced the 2006 will and claimed it superseded the 2002 will. The Foundation challenged the 2006 will, alleging it was a forgery. The trial judge found in favour of the Foundation, concluding that the 2006 will was indeed a forgery, based on Chan’s untrustworthiness, inconsistencies in his evidence, and the circumstances surrounding the will’s creation and attestation.  Chan appealed this decision.  Key evidence included the testimony of the attesting witnesses, handwriting analysis, and evidence of substantial financial transfers from Nina Wang to Chan.  The case was complicated by Nina Wang’s long-standing claim that her husband, Teddy Wang, was still alive despite evidence to the contrary, and her history of charitable work.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**Chinachem Charitable Foundation (Respondent/Plaintiff):**

*   The 2006 will was a forgery created by Chan Chun Chuen to fraudulently obtain Nina Wang’s vast estate.
*   Chan was an untrustworthy witness who tailored his evidence to suit his case.
*   The circumstances surrounding the creation and attestation of the 2006 will were suspicious and inconsistent with Nina Wang’s usual practices.
*   The 2002 will was genuine and reflected Nina Wang’s true intentions to benefit the Foundation and continue her charitable work.
*   The financial transfers to Chan were part of a pattern of deception and were not indicative of a genuine intention to leave him the entire estate.

**Chan Chun Chuen (Appellant/Defendant):**

*   The 2006 will was valid and reflected Nina Wang’s genuine desire to leave her estate to him, as they were in a loving relationship.
*   The 2002 will was a “charade” created to secure assistance in the litigation regarding Teddy Wang’s will.
*   The judge failed to properly evaluate the evidence based on inherent probabilities and improbabilities.
*   The evidence did not justify the conclusion that the 2006 will was a forgery.
*   The judge was biased against him due to his disapproval of the relationship with Nina Wang.



### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The core legal principles established or reinforced in *Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v. Chan Chun Chuen* relate to the burden of proof in probate cases, the evaluation of evidence, the assessment of testamentary capacity and fraud, and the interpretation of wills.  The case provides a detailed examination of how a court should approach a challenge to the validity of a will, particularly when allegations of forgery are involved.

**1. Burden of Proof and Standard of Proof:** The case reaffirms the principle that the party propounding a will (in this case, Chan) bears the burden of proving its validity.  When a will is challenged on grounds of forgery, the standard of proof is high – the challenger must prove the forgery on a balance of probabilities.  This is a stringent requirement, reflecting the importance of upholding the deceased’s testamentary wishes.

**2. Evaluation of Evidence and Witness Credibility:** The court emphasized the importance of a meticulous evaluation of all evidence, including documentary evidence, expert testimony, and witness credibility.  The judge’s assessment of Chan’s credibility as a key witness was central to the decision. The court affirmed that a judge is entitled to form a negative impression of a witness’s trustworthiness and to draw adverse inferences from inconsistencies in their testimony.  The judge’s repeated finding that Chan was untrustworthy was a crucial factor in the decision.

**3. Inherent Probabilities and Improbabilities:** The court clarified that the judge *must* consider inherent probabilities and improbabilities when evaluating evidence. However, the judge is not required to give a specific weight to each improbability. The judge’s role is to weigh all the evidence, including the inherent probabilities, and reach a conclusion based on the overall balance of probabilities.  The fact that the judge *did* consider the improbabilities, even if not explicitly assigning weight, was sufficient.

**4. Forgery and the Attesting Witnesses:** The case highlights the critical importance of the evidence of attesting witnesses in cases of alleged forgery.  The judge’s finding that the attesting witnesses’ evidence proved the document signed on 16 October 2006 was not the 2006 will was decisive.  The court emphasized that a finding of forgery must be based on clear and convincing evidence, and the testimony of the witnesses was paramount.  The inconsistencies in the witnesses’ accounts, coupled with the circumstances surrounding the attestation, led the judge to conclude that the will was forged.

**5. Handwriting Evidence and Expert Testimony:** The case provides a detailed discussion of the principles of handwriting identification.  It affirmed that the absence of fundamental differences between a questioned signature and known authentic signatures does not necessarily prove genuineness, while the presence of significant differences can indicate forgery. The court emphasized the importance of using appropriate comparison signatures and the need for experts to consider the range of variation in a person’s handwriting. The judge’s preference for the evidence of the plaintiff’s expert, who identified numerous rare features in the questioned signature, was upheld.

**6. The “No-Lose” Argument and Statistical Analysis:** The case introduced the concept of the “no-lose” argument in handwriting analysis, which posits that if the range of variation in a person’s handwriting is so broad that a match is inevitable, the comparison is not significant. The court accepted the logic of this argument, finding that the presence of numerous rare features in the questioned signature made it highly improbable that it was genuine. The judge’s acceptance of the statistical point, based on the rarity of the features, strengthened the conclusion of forgery.

**7.  The Importance of Context and Surrounding Circumstances:** The court underscored the importance of considering the surrounding circumstances when evaluating the validity of a will.  Nina Wang’s history of charitable work, her long-standing claim that her husband was still alive, and her secretive relationship with Chan were all relevant factors. The judge considered these factors in assessing Chan’s motives and the credibility of his evidence.

**8.  Discretion in Costs Orders:** The case reaffirms the broad discretion of the court in awarding costs in probate matters.  Given the finding of deliberate fraud, the judge was entitled to order costs on an indemnity basis, reflecting the egregious nature of Chan’s conduct.



### 4. Striking, Unusual or Remarkable Aspects

Several aspects of this case are striking and remarkable:

*   **The Scale of the Fortune:** The sheer magnitude of the estate – estimated at around $100 billion – is extraordinary. This made the case a matter of significant public interest and heightened the stakes for all parties involved.
*   **The Teddy Wang Mystery:** The long-running saga of Teddy Wang’s disappearance and Nina Wang’s insistence that he was still alive added a layer of complexity and intrigue to the case.  The earlier litigation regarding Teddy Wang’s will cast a shadow over the proceedings.
*   **The Secretive Relationship:** The clandestine nature of Nina Wang’s relationship with Chan Chun Chuen, and the substantial financial transfers to him, raised serious questions about his motives and the validity of the 2006 will.
*   **The Fung Shui Element:** The prominence of fung shui in Nina Wang’s life, and Chan’s initial introduction as a fung shui master, was unusual and added a unique dimension to the case. The judge’s finding that the 2006 will may have been a “fung shui will” is particularly intriguing.
*   **The Judge’s Strong Findings:** The judge’s repeated finding that Chan was untrustworthy
