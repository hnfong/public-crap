**Sec. 71103.** States must begin by January 1, 2027, implementing a process to regularly obtain address information for Medicaid and CHIP enrollees from reliable sources like the USPS National Change of Address Database and managed care entities. By October 1, 2029, states must submit enrollee data—including social security numbers and other identifying information—to a new federal system established by the Secretary. This system will check for individuals enrolled in multiple states and trigger actions to disenroll those not residing in the state of enrollment.

**Sec. 71104.** States must conduct quarterly screenings of the Death Master File (or successor system) to identify deceased individuals enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP. If a deceased individual is identified, the state must treat the information as factual, disenroll the individual, and stop payments for services provided after death.

This requirement applies to the 50 states and the District of Columbia, beginning January 1, 2027.

**Sec. 71105.** States must check the Death Master File quarterly to determine if a provider or supplier enrolled under Medicaid is deceased.

The HHS Administrator is appropriated $75 million for fiscal year 2026 to support this section.

**Sec. 71108.** States may apply a home equity limit of up to $1 million for long-term care eligibility, exceeding the standard $500,000 limit, for homes not zoned for agricultural use.

The change applies beginning January 1, 2028.

**Sec. 71109.** Beginning October 1, 2026, Medicaid payments are prohibited for individuals who are not U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, Cuban/Haitian entrants, or individuals under a Compact of Free Association.

The HHS Administrator is appropriated $1 million for fiscal year 2026 to support implementation.

**Sec. 71111.** The Secretary of HHS must suspend implementation, administration, and enforcement of the 2024 CMS rule on staffing standards for long-term care facilities under Medicare and Medicaid from enactment through September 30, 2034.

The HHS Administrator is appropriated $1 million for fiscal year 2026 to support this section.

**Sec. 71112.** States must limit retroactive Medicaid coverage to the month before the application for assistance was made for individuals eligible under subsection (a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII), and to the second month before the application for all others. This change applies to medical assistance, child health assistance, and pregnancy-related assistance for applications made on or after the first quarter after December 31, 2026. The rule reduces the retroactive period to prevent overpayment. The HHS Administrator is appropriated $10 million for fiscal year 2026 to support implementation.

The HHS Administrator is appropriated $1 million for fiscal year 2026 to support implementation.

**Sec. 71114.** The increased FMAP incentive for states that expand Medicaid is sunsetting; the incentive no longer applies if a state begins expending funds for all such individuals prior to January 1, 2026.

The change applies to all states that previously qualified for the incentive. The rule ensures the incentive is only available to states that delay implementation.

**Sec. 71115.** The hold harmless threshold for non-expansion states is set at 0% for fiscal years 2028–2032, with the applicable percent of net patient revenue decreasing from 6% to 3.5%.

The rule applies to all states and the District of Columbia. The HHS Administrator is appropriated $7 million annually from 2026 to 2033 to support implementation.

Exceptions apply for individuals under 19, those in medical care, or those with disabilities. The rule applies to the 50 states and the District of Columbia, beginning January 1, 2027.
