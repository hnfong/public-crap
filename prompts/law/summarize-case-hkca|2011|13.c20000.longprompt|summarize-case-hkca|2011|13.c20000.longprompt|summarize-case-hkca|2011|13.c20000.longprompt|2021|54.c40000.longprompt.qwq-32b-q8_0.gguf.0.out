Okay, let's tackle this case. First, I need to summarize the facts. The case is about the constitutionality of Hong Kong's New Territories Small House Policy. The policy allows male indigenous villagers to build small houses on certain land, which has been criticized as discriminatory based on gender and social origin. The applicants challenged the policy under the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights, arguing it violates equality provisions. The lower court found parts of the policy unconstitutional, but the appeals court overturned that, saying the policy is protected under the Basic Law's Article 40 as a traditional right.

Next, the arguments of the parties. The applicants claimed the policy discriminates against non-indigenous residents and women, violating equality clauses. The respondents and interested party argued that the policy is a traditional right of the New Territories indigenous inhabitants, protected under Article 40, which shields such rights from discrimination challenges.

For the legal principles, the key is the interpretation of Article 40. The court held that "lawful traditional rights" under Article 40 are those recognized as lawful in Hong Kong's legal system at the time of the Basic Law's enactment in 1990. The Small House Policy, existing since 1972 and recognized in legislation and international agreements, qualifies. The court emphasized that Article 40's protection overrides other constitutional rights like equality, as the policy was part of historical agreements and the Basic Law's intent to preserve such rights despite their discriminatory nature.

Controversial points include the court's broad interpretation of "traditional rights" without requiring a strict historical link to pre-1898 practices. Also, the decision to uphold the policy despite its gender discrimination, relying on international reservations under CEDAW, is notable. The court's coherence argument with other Basic Law provisions (like Article 122) to justify the policy's validity is another key point.

Lastly, what's striking? The case's significance lies in balancing historical rights with modern equality principles. The court's decision to prioritize historical agreements over contemporary anti-discrimination laws is remarkable. Also, the policy's long-standing existence without legal challenge until this case is unusual, highlighting the complexity of balancing tradition and modernity in legal systems.

### 1. Summary of the Facts  
The case **KWOK CHEUK KIN AND ANOTHER v. DIRECTOR OF LANDS AND OTHERS [2021] HKCA 54** concerns the constitutionality of Hong Kong’s **New Territories Small House Policy (Small House Policy)**, which allows male indigenous villagers in the New Territories to apply for grants to build small houses on certain land. The policy has been in place since 1972 and grants three forms of land rights: free building licenses (on private land), private treaty grants (on government land at concessionary rates), and land exchanges. The policy is inherently discriminatory, favoring male descendants of pre-1898 New Territories residents over non-indigenous residents and women.  

The applicants, non-indigenous residents and female villagers, challenged the policy under **Article 25** (equality), **Article 39** (Bill of Rights), and **Article 7** (land management) of the Basic Law, arguing it violates anti-discrimination principles. The respondents (government) and the interested party (representing indigenous villagers) defended the policy under **Article 40** of the Basic Law, which protects the “lawful traditional rights and interests” of New Territories indigenous inhabitants (NTIIs).  

The lower court (High Court) partially upheld the challenge, declaring parts of the policy unconstitutional (specifically private treaty grants and land exchanges), while upholding free building licenses as a protected traditional right. The appeals court overturned this decision, ruling the entire policy constitutional under Article 40.

### 2. Summary of the Parties’ Arguments  

#### **Applicants’ Arguments**  
1. **Discrimination**: The policy discriminates against non-indigenous residents (based on social origin/birth) and women (based on sex), violating **Basic Law Articles 25, 39**, and the **Hong Kong Bill of Rights (BOR) Article 22**.  
2. **Failure to Justify**: The government did not demonstrate that the discrimination was justified under the proportionality test.  
3. **Non-Traditional Rights**: The Small House Policy’s benefits (e.g., private treaty grants and land exchanges) are not “traditional” as they evolved post-1898 and lack continuity with pre-colonial customs.  
4. **Violation of Land Management**: The policy breaches **Article 7** by prioritizing NTIIs over equitable land use for all Hong Kong residents.  

#### **Respondents’ and Interested Party’s Arguments**  
1. **Protection Under Article 40**: The Small House Policy’s rights are “lawful traditional rights” protected by Basic Law Article 40, which shields them from equality challenges.  
2. **Historical Continuity**: The policy’s roots lie in pre-1898 customs (e.g., building houses on ancestral land) and were recognized by the colonial government. Post-1972 forms (private treaty grants, exchanges) are administrative extensions of these traditions.  
3. **International Agreements**: The policy aligns with **Annex III of the Sino-British Joint Declaration** (1984), which preserved land rights granted before 1997, including small house grants.  
4. **CEDAW Reservations**: The UK and China’s reservations under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) exempt the policy’s gender discrimination from international scrutiny.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  

#### **Core Issue**: Interpretation of Basic Law Article 40  
The court held that **Article 40** protects the NTIIs’ “lawful traditional rights and interests” as recognized in Hong Kong’s legal system **at the time of the Basic Law’s enactment (1990)**, not requiring strict historical continuity to pre-1898 practices. Key principles include:  

#### **A. Definition of “Lawful Traditional Rights”**  
1. **“Traditional” Rights**:  
   - **Not Strictly Pre-1898**: The court rejected the lower court’s requirement to trace rights to pre-1898 customs. Instead, it focused on whether the rights were **recognized as traditional by 1990**.  
   - **Evolution Permitted**: Traditional rights may evolve over time while retaining their “essential features.” For example, private treaty grants and land exchanges were deemed extensions of pre-colonial customs (e.g., building on ancestral land) adapted to modern administrative practices.  

2. **“Lawful” Rights**:  
   - **Protected from Legal Challenge**: The rights must have been recognized as lawful under Hong Kong’s legal system before 1997. Since the Small House Policy was never legally challenged and was codified in legislation (e.g., the **Buildings Ordinance**) and international agreements (Annex III), it qualifies as “lawful.”  
   - **Immunity from Equality Claims**: Article 40 shields these rights from challenges under equality provisions (Basic Law Articles 25, 39; BOR Article 22). The policy’s inherent discrimination is constitutionally entrenched.  

#### **B. Coherence with Other Basic Law Provisions**  
1. **Article 122**: This provision explicitly protects small house grants’ rent benefits for male descendants of pre-1898 residents. The court emphasized that reading Article 40 with Article 122 confirms the policy’s constitutional validity.  
2. **Joint Declaration and CEDAW Reservations**: The UK and China’s CEDAW reservations (1996–1997) exempt the policy’s gender discrimination, reinforcing its legality under international law.  

#### **C. Novelty and Controversy**  
1. **Broad Interpretation of “Traditional”**: The court’s rejection of strict historical tracing (contrary to the lower court) is controversial. It prioritizes **contemporary recognition** over historical fidelity, ensuring the policy’s survival despite its modern evolution.  
2. **Overriding Equality Rights**: The decision upholds a policy that explicitly discriminates against women and non-indigenous residents, subordinating equality principles to historical agreements. This reflects a tension between **preserving cultural traditions** and **modern anti-discrimination norms**.  
3. **Role of International Agreements**: The reliance on Annex III and CEDAW reservations underscores how Hong Kong’s legal system must navigate its unique constitutional framework, balancing colonial-era agreements with post-1997 governance.

### 4. Striking or Unusual Aspects of the Case  
1. **Historical Entrenchment of Discrimination**: The court’s validation of gender discrimination (male-only eligibility) as a “traditional right” is striking. It highlights how historical practices, even if discriminatory, can become constitutionally protected.  
2. **Longstanding Policy Without Legal Challenge**: The policy operated for nearly 50 years without legal challenge, reflecting the NTIIs’ political influence and the government’s deference to customary rights. The case marks the first judicial scrutiny of its legality.  
3. **Judicial Activism vs. Restraint**: The appeals court’s broad interpretation of Article 40 contrasts with the lower court’s narrower approach. This divergence underscores the **subjectivity in constitutional interpretation**, particularly for provisions like Article .  
4. **Land Use and Social Equity**: The policy’s prioritization of NTIIs over equitable land distribution for all residents raises questions about resource allocation in densely populated Hong Kong. The court’s dismissal of the Article 7 challenge (land management) reflects a deference to historical agreements over modern planning needs.  

In summary, the case is remarkable for its **constitutional balancing act**, where historical traditions and international agreements override contemporary equality principles, illustrating the complexities of Hong Kong’s legal and political landscape. [end of text]
