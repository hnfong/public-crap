Okay, let's tackle this case summary. First, I need to understand the facts. The case is about two people, Chan and Tseng, who were charged with bribery under the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO). Chan was a TVB employee, and Tseng was his agent. They were involved in a situation where a third party, Olympian City, wanted to include Chan in a Countdown show, which was a TVB show. The key point is that Chan was paid by Olympian City through Tseng, but he didn't get permission from TVB. The charges were about accepting an advantage without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.

Now, the two parties' arguments. The prosecution argues that Chan's participation in the show was in relation to TVB's affairs, thus making the payment an advantage for a forbidden purpose. They also argue that the reasonable excuse defense doesn't apply here because the payment was for a benefit that could affect TVB's business. The defense, on the other hand, claims that Chan's participation was a personal act as a celebrity, not related to his role as TVB's agent, and that he had a reasonable excuse because TVB was aware of his involvement and didn't object. They also argue that the prosecution didn't prove that the payment was intended to influence TVB's business.

For the legal principles, the main issue is the interpretation of "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" in section 9 of POBO. The Court of Appeal initially thought that any act related to TVB's programs would count, but the majority of the judges, including Ribeiro and Tang, found that the payment wasn't for a purpose that would affect TVB's business. They emphasized that the act must be aimed at the principal's business and that the payment must be for a forbidden purpose. The Court of Appeal's reasoning was criticized for being too broad, as they didn't consider whether the act was actually adverse to the principal's interests. The majority also addressed the reasonable excuse defense, stating that even if the act was beneficial, the lack of informed consent could still be a defense. They cited Ch’ng Poh, where the Privy Council said that the act must be intended to influence the principal's affairs, not just related to them.

The case is remarkable because it's a complex legal interpretation of the POBO, especially the phrase "in relation to his principal's affairs or business." The majority's decision to quash the convictions was based on the idea that the payment wasn't for a purpose that would harm TVB's interests, even though the show was part of TVB's programming. This highlights the importance of intent and whether the act actually undermines the principal's interests, not just the fact that it's related. It also shows the tension between the broad interpretation of the law and the need for a more nuanced approach, considering the actual impact on the principal. The case also touches on the burden of proof for reasonable excuse in conspiracy charges, which is a bit of a legal nuance. The majority's reasoning was that the prosecution had to prove the payment was for a forbidden purpose, not just that it was related, which is a key distinction. The case is notable for its detailed analysis of the legislative intent behind the POBO, emphasizing that the law is about preventing corruption, not just any payment related to the principal's business. The use of Ch’ng Poh as a reference is significant, but the majority found that the Court of Appeal misapplied it by not considering the actual harm to the principal. The case also shows how the law can be interpreted in different ways, leading to a reversal of the previous decision, which is unusual in the context of a high court case.

### 1. Summary of the Facts  
The case involves two individuals, **Stephen Chan Chi Wan ("Chan")** and **Tseng Pei Kun ("Tseng")**, who were charged with bribery under the **Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO)**. Chan was employed by **Television Broadcasts Ltd ("TVB")** as General Manager (Broadcasting), a role that did not require him to appear on camera but allowed him to host a popular talk show called “Be My Guest” on TVB’s pay channel. This show, which he hosted voluntarily, gained significant popularity, leading to his engagement by third parties (including **Olympian City**, a shopping mall operator) to appear at external events. Between June 2008 and January 2010, Chan participated in 20+ such events, receiving remuneration for 18 of them.  

**Olympian City** had a long-standing partnership with TVB to sponsor a New Year’s Eve Countdown show. In November 2009, they agreed to include a live, staged version of “Be My Guest” as part of the Countdown event, which would be produced and broadcast by TVB. Olympian City paid **IEAP** (Tseng’s company) $160,000 for this arrangement, with IEAP retaining $28,000 and passing $112,000 to Chan and $20,000 to Lai Yiu Cheung (“Lai”). Chan did not seek permission from TVB to appear on the show, despite his contractual obligation to do so. TVB was aware of Chan’s involvement in the show but did not object, as it was a well-known and popular program.  

The prosecution charged Chan with **accepting an advantage without lawful authority or reasonable excuse** (section 9(1)(a) of POBO) and Tseng with **offering an advantage to an agent** (section 9(2)(a)). The Court of Appeal initially acquitted them, but the prosecution appealed, leading to a reversal of the acquittal. The appeals were then heard by the **Final Appeal Court**, where the majority of judges (Ribeiro, Tang, Fok, and Stock) concluded that the convictions should be quashed.

### 2. Summary of the Parties’ Arguments  
**Prosecution’s Argument**:  
The prosecution contended that Chan’s participation in the “Be My Guest” segment of the Countdown show was an act **“in relation to TVB’s affairs or business”** under section 9(1)(a) of POBO. They argued that the payment of $112,000 by Olympian City through IEAP was an **inducement to Chan’s act** (hosting the show) in relation to TVB’s business, as the show was part of TVB’s programming and its inclusion in the Countdown event would influence TVB’s contractual relationship with Olympian City. The prosecution emphasized that the payment was for a purpose that could **adversely affect TVB’s interests**, such as securing a benefit for Olympian City or influencing the show’s content. They also argued that the **reasonable excuse defense** was not applicable because Chan’s conduct did not align with TVB’s interests, and the lack of informed consent from TVB was a key factor.  

**Defense’s Argument**:  
The defense, represented by Chan and Tseng, argued that Chan’s participation in the show was **not in relation to TVB’s affairs or business** but rather as a **celebrity or artiste**. They contended that the show was a personal endeavor, not tied to TVB’s operational decisions, and that the payment was for a **beneficial act** (boosting TVB’s audience ratings) that did not conflict with TVB’s interests. The defense also emphasized that **TVB was aware of Chan’s involvement** and did not object, which could constitute a **reasonable excuse** under section 9. They submitted that the prosecution failed to prove that the payment was intended to **influence or affect TVB’s business** in a way that would constitute corruption. Additionally, the defense argued that the **burden of proof for reasonable excuse** in conspiracy charges should not shift to the accused, as the prosecution did not establish that the payment was for a forbidden purpose.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The case hinges on the interpretation of **section 9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO)**, which criminalizes corrupt transactions involving agents and their principals. The **ratio decidendi** of the case is multifaceted, involving the **mens rea** (mental element) of the offense, the **scope of “in relation to his principal’s affairs or business”**, and the **application of the reasonable excuse defense**.  

#### **A. Mens Rea and the Nature of the Offense**  
The majority of the judges (Ribeiro, Tang, Fok, and Stock) held that **section 9 requires proof of a corrupt intent** in both the **offering** and **accepting** of an advantage. For an agent (Chan) accepting an advantage, the prosecution must demonstrate that **Chan knew or believed** the payment was intended to influence or affect TVB’s affairs or business. For the offeror (Tseng), the prosecution must prove that **Tseng intended the payment to be an inducement or reward** for Chan’s act in relation to TVB’s interests.  

The **Court of Appeal** had previously interpreted the phrase “in relation to his principal’s affairs or business” broadly, arguing that any act related to TVB’s programming (e.g., Chan’s show) would suffice. However, the majority rejected this, emphasizing that the **phrase must be interpreted restrictively** to mean that the act must be **“aimed at”** the principal’s business and **intended to influence or affect** it. This aligns with the **ratio decidendi** in **Commissioner of the ICAC v Ch’ng Poh** (1997), where the Privy Council held that the **offense requires the agent’s act to be directly tied to the principal’s interests**.  

#### **B. Interpretation of “In Relation to His Principal’s Affairs or Business”**  
The majority clarified that the phrase **“in relation to his principal’s affairs or business”** does not merely require the act to be **“related to”** the principal’s activities but must be **“aimed at”** and **intended to influence** the principal’s interests. This is a **novel interpretation** of the phrase, distinguishing it from the **broad, factual relationship** approach used by the Court of Appeal.  

In **Ch’ng Poh**, the Privy Council held that the **offense applies only if the agent’s act is intended to influence the principal’s affairs**, not just if it is related to them. The majority in this case applied this principle, arguing that **Chan’s participation in the show was not aimed at TVB’s business** but rather at **Olympian City’s promotional interests**. The show was a **personal endeavor** by Chan, and TVB’s involvement was limited to broadcasting it, not directing its content or participants. The **reasonable excuse defense** was also scrutinized, with the majority rejecting the Court of Appeal’s reliance on **Ch’ng Poh** to justify a broad interpretation of the phrase.  

#### **C. The Role of “Reasonable Excuse”**  
The majority held that **reasonable excuse is a defense that requires the accused to prove that the act was not corrupt**. However, they clarified that **reasonable excuse does not apply if the act is inherently beneficial to the principal**. In this case, the defense argued that **TVB’s acceptance of Chan’s participation** (even without explicit permission) constituted a **reasonable excuse**, as the payment was for a **beneficial act** (boosting TVB’s audience ratings). The majority rejected this, stating that **reasonable excuse is not a defense for acts that are inherently aligned with the principal’s interests**.  

The **Court of Appeal** had mistakenly equated **“related to”** with **“aimed at”**, leading to an incorrect conclusion that the payment was for a **forbidden purpose**. The majority corrected this, emphasizing that **the prosecution must prove that the act was intended to influence the principal’s affairs**, not just that it was related to them. This distinction is critical, as **Chan’s act was not intended to harm TVB** but rather to **benefit it**, which disqualifies it from being a corrupt transaction.  

#### **D. The Burden of Proof in Conspiracy Charges**  
The majority addressed the **burden of proof** in conspiracy cases. They rejected the **Court of Appeal’s reliance on section 24 of POBO**, which shifts the burden of proving reasonable excuse to the accused. The majority argued that **section 24 applies only to substantive offenses**, not to **conspiracy charges**, which are governed by **common law principles**. In **conspiracy**, the prosecution must prove that the **agreement was to commit a corrupt act**, not that the act itself was corrupt. The majority concluded that **the prosecution failed to prove that the payment was for a forbidden purpose**, making the conspiracy charge inapplicable.  

#### **E. The Mischief of the Legislation**  
The majority emphasized that the **legislative intent** of POBO is to **prevent corruption in private sector agency relationships**, not to criminalize **any payment related to the principal’s business**. They cited **Ch’ng Poh** and **Morgan** (1970) to argue that the **offense requires a specific, adverse purpose**. In **Morgan**, the Court of Appeal held that an agent could be liable for a payment related to a third party’s (e.g., a union) affairs, even if the principal (TVB) was not involved. However, the majority in this case distinguished **Morgan** by noting that **Chan’s act was not related to TVB’s business** but rather to **Olympian City’s promotional interests**.  

#### **F. The Role of “Corruptly” in the Legislation**  
The majority rejected the **Court of Appeal’s interpretation** that the removal of the word “corruptly” from POBO (replaced by “without lawful authority or reasonable excuse”) meant the **offense only requires a payment without the principal’s knowledge**. They argued that **“corruptly” was removed to avoid the burden of proving intent**, but the **legislature still intended to criminalize acts that undermine the principal’s interests**. The majority clarified that **the phrase “in relation to his principal’s affairs or business”** must be **interpreted restrictively**, requiring the act to be **intended to influence the principal’s affairs**.  

#### **G. The Scope of the Offense**  
The majority rejected the **Court of Appeal’s broad interpretation** of the offense, which allowed for **any act related to the principal’s business**. They held that **the offense is not triggered by mere association** with the principal’s business but by **specific, adverse intent**. For example, if an agent accepts a payment to **benefit the principal**, it does not constitute a corrupt transaction. The majority also rejected the **argument that the principal’s lack of objection** (e.g., TVB not objecting to Chan’s participation) could be a **reasonable excuse**, as **TVB’s acceptance of the act was not a formal permission** but rather a **passive acknowledgment** of the show’s popularity.  

#### **H. The Role of the Principal’s Knowledge and Consent**  
The majority emphasized that **the principal’s knowledge and consent** are **not irrelevant** to the offense. Even if the principal is aware of the act, **the payment must still be for a purpose that undermines the principal’s interests**. In **Ch’ng Poh**, the Privy Council held that the **offense requires the agent’s act to be intended to influence the principal’s affairs**, not just that the principal is involved. The majority applied this to the case, noting that **TVB’s involvement in the show was passive** and that **Chan’s act was not intended to harm TVB** but to **benefit it**.  

#### **I. The Interaction of Section 9 and Section 4**  
The majority also addressed the **difference between section 9 and section 4** of POBO. Section 4 (previously section 3 of the Prevention of Corruption Ordinance) criminalizes **corrupt acts by public servants**, while section 9 targets **corrupt transactions with agents**. The majority clarified that **section 9 is not a mirror image of section 4** but requires **specific intent to influence the principal’s affairs**. This distinction is **controversial**, as it suggests that **section 9 is more narrowly tailored** to prevent **corruption in private sector agency relationships**.  

#### **J. The Role of the “Reasonable Excuse” Defense**  
The majority held that **reasonable excuse is not a defense for acts that are inherently beneficial to the principal**. They cited **Ch’ng Poh** and **Morgan** to argue that **the defense requires the act to be for a purpose that conflicts with the principal’s interests**. In this case, **Chan’s participation was beneficial to TVB**, so the **reasonable excuse defense** could not apply. The majority also rejected the **Court of Appeal’s reliance on the “reasonable excuse” defense** in conspiracy cases, stating that **the prosecution must prove the payment was for a forbidden purpose**.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case  
This case is **remarkable for its detailed legal analysis** of the **interpretation of the phrase “in relation to his principal’s affairs or business”** in section 9 of POBO. The **Court of Appeal’s initial interpretation** was **criticized for being overly broad**, as it equated **“related to”** with **“aimed at”**, which the majority rejected. The **majority’s reasoning** in this case is **novel** in that it **requires the act to be directly intended to influence the principal’s interests**, not just related to them.  

Another **striking aspect** is the **tension between the legislative intent** of POBO and the **common law principles** of conspiracy. The majority clarified that **section 24 of POBO does not apply to conspiracy charges**, which are governed by **common law requirements**. This is **unusual** because it **reverses the burden of proof** in conspiracy cases, which is typically **not shifted to the accused**.  

The **case also highlights the importance of intent** in determining the **criminality of an act**. The majority held that **Chan’s act was not corrupt** because it was **intended to benefit TVB**, not harm it. This **contrasts sharply** with the **Court of Appeal’s reasoning**, which focused on the **principal’s lack of objection**.  

Additionally, the **case is notable for its reliance on Ch’ng Poh** as a **leading authority**, but the **majority’s interpretation** of that case **differs significantly** from the **Court of Appeal’s application**. The **majority’s interpretation** of Ch’ng Poh is **more restrictive**, emphasizing that the **offense requires the agent’s act to be directly aimed at the principal’s interests**, not just related to them.  

The **case also raises questions about the scope of the “reasonable excuse” defense** in conspiracy charges. The majority rejected the **Court of Appeal’s reliance on section 24** for conspiracy cases, arguing that **the prosecution must prove the payment was for a forbidden purpose**. This **shifts the burden of proof** back to the prosecution, which is **unusual** in the context of conspiracy charges.  

Finally, the **case is remarkable for its emphasis on the principal’s interests** in determining the **criminality of an act**. The majority held that **even if the principal is aware of the act, it is not necessarily exempt from the offense** if the act is **intended to influence their affairs**. This **contrasts with the Court of Appeal’s reasoning**, which focused on the **principal’s lack of objection**. The **majority’s approach** is **more aligned with the legislative intent** of POBO, which is to **prevent corruption in private sector agency relationships**.  

In summary, the case is **remarkable for its nuanced interpretation of the POBO**, its **rejection of the Court of Appeal’s broad application of the law**, and its **emphasis on the principal’s interests** in determining the **criminality of an act**. It also raises **controversial questions** about the **burden of proof in conspiracy charges** and the **scope of the “reasonable excuse” defense**. [end of text]
