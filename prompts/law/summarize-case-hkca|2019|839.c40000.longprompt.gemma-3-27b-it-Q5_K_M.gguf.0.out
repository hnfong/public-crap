## HKSAR v. WONG CHO SHING AND OTHERS – Case Summary

### 1. Facts of the Case

In 2014, during the “Occupy Central” protests in Hong Kong, seven police officers (D1-D7) were accused of assaulting Tsang Kin Chiu. The incident occurred after Tsang was seen splashing liquid onto police officers. He was initially restrained, then allegedly carried face down to an area behind a substation where he was assaulted. D5 was also charged with common assault for slapping Tsang in an interview room. All seven were convicted in the District Court and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment. The case revolved heavily around video and photographic evidence obtained from various sources (TVB, Apple Daily, ATV, Now TV, CCTV) and the authenticity and admissibility of that evidence.  A prior application for a production order to compel the release of original footage was denied. The appeal centered on the identification of the officers in the footage, the standard of proof for authenticity of the video evidence, and the appropriateness of the sentence. D4 and D7 were less clearly identified in the footage.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**The Prosecution (HKSAR):** Argued that the video and photographic evidence, even if sourced from the internet, was sufficiently authenticated through witness testimony (police officers and Tsang himself) and internal consistency. They maintained the judge correctly applied the law regarding admissibility, requiring a *prima facie* showing of authenticity. They emphasized the seriousness of the offense – police officers abusing their power – and justified the sentences as a deterrent. They defended the denial of the production order, arguing the material was already in the public domain.

**The Defense (Appellants):**  Raised multiple grounds of appeal.  A central argument was that the judge applied the incorrect legal test for admissibility, requiring only a *prima facie* showing of authenticity when a “balance of probabilities” standard should have been applied. They challenged the reliability of the video evidence, pointing to the lack of original footage and the absence of key witnesses (photographers/cameramen).  They argued the identification of some officers (D4 and D7) was unsafe due to poor quality footage and lack of positive identification by witnesses.  They also argued that the sentences were excessive, considering the context of the protests, the officers’ long service records, and the potential damage to their careers.  D1 and D2 argued they were less culpable as they were senior officers who failed to intervene rather than directly participating in the assault.



### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

This case provides a detailed examination of the law surrounding the admissibility of video and photographic evidence, particularly “open source” material obtained from the internet. The Court of Appeal clarified several key principles, and addressed some controversial areas.

**1. Admissibility of Video/Photographic Evidence:** The Court reaffirmed the principle that video and photographic evidence is admissible if it is *relevant* and its authenticity is established to a *prima facie* extent.  The Court explicitly rejected the argument that a “balance of probabilities” standard is required for admissibility, upholding the earlier decision in *HKSAR v Lee Chi Fai*.  The Court emphasized that the question for the judge at the admissibility stage is whether the evidence, *if believed*, would be sufficient to prove the matter asserted.  The weight and ultimate credibility of the evidence are matters for the jury (or the judge in a trial without a jury).  The Court acknowledged the potential for manipulation of digital evidence but held that this risk does not necessitate a higher admissibility threshold.

**2. Authentication of Evidence:** The Court clarified that authentication is closely linked to relevance.  Authenticity doesn’t require absolute certainty, but rather a sufficient foundation to allow the evidence to be considered by the fact-finder. Authentication can be proven circumstantially, through corroborating evidence, comparisons with other recordings, and witness testimony.  The Court emphasized that the judge’s role is a “screening” or “gatekeeper” function – to ensure the evidence is capable of being authentic, not to definitively determine its authenticity at the admissibility stage.  The Court also noted that the existence of the original recording doesn’t automatically disqualify a copy, as long as the copy’s provenance and integrity can be established.

**3. The Role of Witness Testimony:** The Court highlighted the importance of witness testimony in establishing authenticity.  In this case, Tsang’s identification of himself in the footage, coupled with the testimony of police officers regarding the events of the night, provided crucial support for the authenticity of the recordings.  The Court recognized that even without the original cameraman testifying, authenticity can be established through other evidence.

**4. Identification of Individuals in Video Evidence:** The Court addressed the challenges of identifying individuals in video footage, particularly when the quality is poor or the footage is unclear.  While positive identification by a witness is ideal, the Court acknowledged that identification can be based on a combination of factors, including clothing, physical characteristics, and the context of the events. However, the Court stressed that identification based solely on partial views or indistinct features is insufficient, especially when no prior identification by a witness exists. This was a key factor in the Court quashing the convictions of D4 and D7, as their identification relied heavily on the judge’s own observations without a solid foundation in witness testimony.

**5. Sentencing Principles in Cases of Police Misconduct:** The Court affirmed the importance of deterring police misconduct and upholding public trust in law enforcement. While acknowledging the difficult circumstances faced by police officers during the protests, the Court held that serious abuses of power must be met with significant penalties. However, the Court reduced the sentences of some appellants, recognizing their long service records and the potential consequences of their convictions.  The Court also clarified that not all participants in a joint enterprise are necessarily equally culpable, and sentencing should reflect the individual’s level of involvement.

**Novel/Controversial Points:**

*   **The “Prima Facie” vs. “Balance of Probabilities” Standard:** The Court’s reaffirmation of the *prima facie* standard for admissibility is potentially controversial. Critics might argue that a higher standard is necessary to protect against the risks of manipulated or unreliable digital evidence. However, the Court reasoned that requiring a “balance of probabilities” at the admissibility stage would unduly burden the prosecution and potentially exclude valuable evidence.
*   **The Reliance on Tsang’s Testimony:**  The heavy reliance on Tsang’s identification and account of events is also potentially controversial, given that he was the victim of the assault and had a potential bias. However, the Court found his testimony to be consistent with other evidence and reasonably reliable.
*   **The Application of the Joint Enterprise Doctrine:** The Court’s nuanced approach to sentencing, recognizing differing levels of culpability within the joint enterprise, is a significant point. It highlights the importance of individualized sentencing and avoiding a “one-size-fits-all” approach in cases involving multiple defendants.
* **The Failure to Obtain a Production Order:** The Court criticized the prosecution for not appealing the denial of the production order for the original footage, but ultimately found it did not affect the outcome given the other evidence available. This highlights the importance of pursuing all available avenues to secure reliable evidence in criminal cases.



In conclusion, *HKSAR v. Wong Cho Shing and Others* provides a comprehensive and nuanced analysis of the legal principles governing the admissibility of digital evidence and the sentencing of police officers for misconduct. The case clarifies the standards for authentication, the role of witness testimony, and the importance of individualized sentencing, while also addressing some of the challenges and controversies surrounding the use of digital evidence in criminal proceedings.
