Got it, let's tackle this case summary step by step. First, I need to remember the user's tasks: facts, parties' arguments, legal principles (ratio), and something striking. 

Starting with the facts. The case is about a will dispute involving Nina Wang's estate. She died in 2007, leaving a 2002 will benefiting the Chinachem Charitable Foundation (First Respondent). The Applicant, Chan Chun Chuen, propounded a 2006 will that left the entire estate to him. The trial (40 days) found the 2006 will a forgery; Court of Appeal dismissed appeal and leave to appeal. Now Applicant seeks leave to appeal to CFA under s22(1) of CFA Ordinance: as of right (two limbs) or discretionary (public importance/otherwise).

Next, parties' arguments. Applicant claims leave as of right under s22(1)(a)(i) (liquidated sum—rejected as probate isn't liquidated) and (a)(ii) (claim to property over $1M). He argues his claim is indirect (winning gives entire estate, like Wang Din Shin and Mui Yim Fong cases). Alternatively, discretionary leave: challenges CFA's practice on concurrent findings (says it's unjustified), argues Court of Appeal didn't make concurrent findings, and seeks to introduce new police statements from a key witness (Winfield Wong) to show miscarriage of justice. 

Foundation argues: (a)(ii) doesn't apply because it's not a claim to specific property/proprietary right, just will validity. On discretionary grounds: CFA's concurrent findings practice is justified; Court of Appeal did make concurrent findings; new evidence is irrelevant (Wong didn't recant key "partial will" evidence, discrepancies are minor).

Legal principles: Need to break down the ratio. First, on s22(1)(a) as of right: The CFA reaffirmed the narrow construction of (a)(ii)—requires a claim to particular property/proprietary right with immediate, quantifiable financial impact (over $1M) from the appeal order. The Applicant failed because even though winning would give the estate, there was an unresolved Issue 9 (whether 2006 will was partial/codicil), so financial benefit wasn't immediate/quantifiable. Also, distinguished Wang Din Shin/Mui Yim Fong because those cases had "winner takes all" with no further adjudication, but here Issue 9 required remand, so no immediacy.

Second, on discretionary leave: The CFA reaffirmed its practice against interfering with concurrent findings of fact (first instance + Court of Appeal) unless there's miscarriage of justice/violation of law/procedure. The Applicant's challenge to this practice failed—CFA cited policy reasons (final appellate role, avoiding litigation attrition, respecting lower courts' fact-finding). The Court of Appeal here did make concurrent findings (thoroughly reviewed evidence, including key witness Wong and scientific evidence). 

Third, new evidence: The CFA held the proposed police statements from Wong didn't undermine his crucial evidence that the 2006 will was a "partial will" (only specific gift, no residue)—Wong didn't recant that; discrepancies were minor (e.g., wording in statements vs. trial testimony about what he told Nina, hypothetical vs. actual facts). Thus, no miscarriage of justice.

Striking/remarkable points: The case involves a high-stakes will forgery dispute (Nina Wang was a billionaire, Chinachem is a major HK company). The CFA's detailed critique of the "as of right" appeal mechanism—expressing that it's outdated (commonwealth jurisdictions abandoned it post-Privy Council), favoring its abolition for public interest. The extensive analysis of concurrent findings practice, justifying why final appellate courts shouldn't revisit facts unless there's clear error/miscarriage. The thorough examination of new evidence, showing how even alleged inconsistencies in witness statements don't rise to the level of undermining core findings (here, the "partial will" evidence was corroborated by another witness, Ng Shun Mo). Also, the length of the trial (40 days) and the complexity of evidence (handwriting, scientific tests, witness credibility) highlight the gravity of the dispute.</seed:think>### 1. Brief Summary of Facts  
The case involves a contentious will dispute over the estate of Nina Wang, who died in 2007. The **Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd** (First Respondent) propounded a 2002 will naming itself as the sole beneficiary. The **Applicant, Chan Chun Chuen**, claimed a 2006 will (allegedly leaving the entire estate to him) was valid. After a 40-day trial, Lam J found the 2006 will to be a forgery, invalidating the Applicant’s claim. The Court of Appeal dismissed the Applicant’s appeal and his subsequent application for leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal (CFA). The Applicant now seeks leave to appeal to the CFA under **Section 22(1) of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance** (Cap 484), arguing entitlement either *as of right* (two limbs) or via discretionary leave (public importance or “otherwise”).


### 2. Arguments of the Parties  
#### **Applicant (Chan Chun Chuen)**  
- **As of Right (s22(1)(a))**:  
  - Relies on the second limb of (a): His claim “involves indirectly some claim to property or civil right valued at ≥ $1M.” He argues winning the appeal would entitle him to the entire estate (a “winner-takes-all” scenario), citing prior Court of Appeal cases (*Wang Din Shin v Nina Kung*, *Re Estate of Mui Yim Fong*) where probate disputes qualified for as-of-right appeals.  
  - Rejects the first limb (liquidated sums) as inapplicable but focuses on the second.  

- **Discretionary Leave (s22(1)(b))**:  
  - Challenges the CFA’s practice of refusing to review *concurrent findings of fact* (first instance + Court of Appeal) unless there is miscarriage of justice/legal error, arguing this practice is “unjustified” and undermines access to justice.  
  - Claims the Court of Appeal failed to make “concurrent findings” (e.g., did not address six “inherent improbabilities” of forgery *seriatim*).  
  - Seeks to introduce “new evidence”: Police statements from key attesting witness Winfield Wong, which he alleges contradict Wong’s trial testimony (e.g., claiming Wong “recanted” that the 2006 will was a “partial will” and disputed the beneficiary’s identity).  


#### **First Respondent (Chinachem Charitable Foundation)**  
- **As of Right (s22(1)(a))**:  
  - The Applicant’s claim is not a “claim to particular property or proprietary right”—it is merely a challenge to will validity, not a direct/indirect property claim. The CFA should overrule *Wang Din Shin* and *Mui Yim Fong* for misapplying (a)(ii).  
  - Even if the 2006 will were valid, **Issue 9** (whether it was a partial will/codicil revoking the 2002 will) remained unresolved at trial. Thus, the financial benefit of a successful appeal is not “immediate” or quantifiable (contrary to s22(1)(a) requirements).  

- **Discretionary Leave (s22(1)(b))**:  
  - The CFA’s concurrent findings practice is justified by policy (final appellate role, avoiding litigation attrition, respecting lower courts’ fact-finding). The Court of Appeal here made thorough concurrent findings (e.g., corroborating Wong’s “partial will” testimony with another witness, Ng Shun Mo, and scientific evidence).  
  - The “new evidence” is irrelevant: Wong did not recant his core testimony that the 2006 will was a partial will (only a specific gift, no residue). Alleged discrepancies (e.g., wording in police statements) are minor and do not undermine the forgery finding.  


### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The case clarifies critical rules on **leave to appeal to the CFA** and **concurrent findings of fact**, with novel/controversial elements:  

#### **A. Narrow Construction of s22(1)(a) (As of Right Appeals)**  
The CFA reaffirmed the strict limits of as-of-right appeals under the second limb of s22(1)(a):  
- **Requirement of “Immediate, Quantifiable Financial Impact”**: To qualify, the appeal must result in an order that *immediately* confers a financial benefit ≥ $1M (no need for further adjudication). The Applicant failed because even if the 2006 will were validated, **Issue 9** (whether it revoked the 2002 will or was a partial codicil) would require remand to quantify the estate share—thus, no immediate financial benefit.  
- **Distinction from Prior Cases**: The CFA upheld *Wang Din Shin* and *Mui Yim Fong* (which allowed as-of-right appeals) but distinguished them: those cases involved “winner-takes-all” scenarios with no unresolved issues (e.g., clear entitlement to the entire estate). Here, unresolved construction issues meant the financial impact was not immediate.  
- **Rejection of “Indirect Property Claims”**: The second limb applies only to claims for *particular property or proprietary rights*, not mere challenges to will validity. The Applicant’s claim was not to property itself, but to have a will declared valid—an insufficient basis for as-of-right leave.  


#### **B. Concurrent Findings of Fact: Justification for Deference**  
The CFA reaffirmed its longstanding practice of **refusing to interfere with concurrent findings of fact** (first instance + Court of Appeal) unless there is:  
1. **Miscarriage of justice** (e.g., violation of natural justice), or  
2. **Critical legal error** (e.g., misapplication of law that vitiates the finding).  

**Policy Rationale**:  
- The CFA’s role as a *final appellate court* is to resolve **points of law of general public importance**, not re-litigate facts. Fact-finding is the province of lower courts, which have greater access to evidence and witness credibility.  
- Avoids “litigation attrition”: Allowing third-tier factual reviews would prolong disputes, especially in high-stakes cases like will forgery, where resources determine outcomes.  
- Corroboration of Findings: Here, the Court of Appeal thoroughly reviewed the trial judge’s findings (e.g., Wong’s “partial will” testimony was corroborated by Ng Shun Mo; scientific evidence supported forgery). The Applicant’s challenge to the practice itself was rejected as “not reasonably arguable.”  


#### **C. New Evidence Standard**  
The CFA clarified that **new evidence cannot override concurrent findings** unless it meets the *Ladd v Marshall* test (fresh, credible, and likely to cause a miscarriage of justice). The Applicant’s proposed police statements from Wong failed this test:  
- Wong did **not recant** his core testimony that the 2006 will was a “partial will” (only a specific gift, no residue). Alleged discrepancies (e.g., wording about what he told Nina Wang) were minor and involved *hypothetical scenarios* (not actual events) or forgetfulness (e.g., later forgetting the beneficiary’s full name).  
- The statements did not undermine the trial judge’s central finding that the 2006 will was forged—corroborated by multiple witnesses and scientific evidence (e.g., ESDA “perfect register” tests).  


#### **D. Critical Commentary on As-of-Right Appeals**  
The CFA *expressed strong support for abolishing as-of-right appeals* (s22(1)(a)), noting that all major Commonwealth jurisdictions (UK, Australia, NZ, Canada) have abandoned this mechanism. The CFA argued this aligns with public interest: as-of-right appeals are “oppressive” to successful litigants, drain resources, and contradict the final court’s role of resolving important legal issues, not routine fact disputes.  


### 4. Striking/Unusual Remarks  
- **High-Stakes Dispute**: Involves the estate of Nina Wang, a Hong Kong billionaire and founder of Chinachem Group—one of the city’s largest property developers. The outcome directly impacts a major charitable foundation and a private individual’s claim to billions.  
- **CFA’s Call to Abolish As-of-Right Appeals**: The court’s explicit endorsement of abolishing s22(1)(a) is unprecedented in recent Hong Kong jurisprudence, reflecting a broader trend in commonwealth final appellate courts to limit “automatic” appeals.  
- **Thorough Fact-Finding**: The trial lasted 40 days, with the CFA spending over 100 paragraphs analyzing witness credibility (notably Winfield Wong and Ng Shun Mo) and scientific evidence—unusual for a leave-to-appeal decision, which typically focuses on legal, not factual, issues.  
- **Witness Testimony Nuance**: The CFA’s detailed analysis of Wong’s police statements (distinguishing “actual facts” from “hypothetical scenarios” proposed by his lawyer) highlights the rigor with which final courts scrutinize witness consistency, even in high-profile cases. [end of text]
