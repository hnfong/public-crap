## 1. Summary of Facts

This case, *Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v. Chan Chun Chuen*, concerns a dispute over the will of the late Nina Wang, a wealthy businesswoman and chairwoman of the Chinachem Group. Nina Wang had previously established a charitable foundation with her late husband, Teddy Wang. After Teddy Wang's disappearance and presumed death, Nina Wang initially relied on his will. However, in 2006, a new will surfaced, purportedly leaving Wang's entire estate to Chan Chun Chuen, a fung shui master who had been introduced to Nina Wang in 1992.

The Chinachem Charitable Foundation challenged the validity of the 2006 will, arguing it was a forgery. Chan Chun Chuen claimed he and Nina Wang were lovers and that she intended to leave him her fortune. The case involved complex background details, including Nina Wang's long-held belief that her husband was still alive, her relationship with Chan Chun Chuen, significant financial transfers from Nina Wang to Chan Chun Chuen, and Nina Wang's declining health due to cancer. The court also considered Nina Wang's continued support for the charitable foundation and the unusual circumstances surrounding the discovery of the 2006 will after her death. Crucially, the court examined the testimony of the witnesses who purportedly signed the 2006 will, Mr. Ng Shung Mo and Mr. Winfield Wong.

## 2. Summary of Arguments

**Chinachem Charitable Foundation (Plaintiff):** The Foundation argued that the 2006 will was a forgery, designed to deprive the Foundation of Nina Wang's substantial estate. They presented evidence suggesting Chan Chun Chuen was untrustworthy and a liar, highlighting inconsistencies in his testimony and a false claim about his educational background. They emphasized Nina Wang's consistent support for the charitable foundation, even after the litigation surrounding Teddy Wang's will, and her continued involvement in the foundation's activities. They argued the 2006 will was not Nina Wang's last will and that she never indicated otherwise. They also pointed to the unusual circumstances surrounding the discovery of the will and the large financial transfers to Chan Chun Chuen as evidence of a fraudulent scheme.

**Chan Chun Chuen (Defendant):** Chan Chun Chuen maintained that the 2006 will was genuine and reflected Nina Wang's true intentions. He claimed he and Nina Wang were lovers and that she wanted him to inherit her estate and become involved in the Chinachem Group. He asserted that the 2002 will was a sham, created under pressure from litigation concerning Teddy Wang's will, and intended to solicit support in that legal battle. He argued that Nina Wang had given him the 2006 will and instructed him to keep it secret.



## 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The Court of Appeal’s judgment in *Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v. Chan Chun Chuen* establishes several key legal principles, particularly concerning probate disputes, the assessment of evidence, and the burden of proof in forgery cases. The case is notable for its detailed analysis of handwriting evidence, the application of statistical principles in assessing the likelihood of forgery, and the court's willingness to scrutinize the credibility of a litigant who presented a highly improbable narrative.

**1. Burden of Proof and Forgery:** The court reaffirmed the established principle that in a probate action challenging the validity of a will, the party alleging forgery bears the burden of proving it on the balance of probabilities. However, the court emphasized that the inherent improbabilities surrounding the circumstances of the will’s creation and execution can significantly influence the court’s assessment of the evidence. The court acknowledged that the more improbable the circumstances, the less evidence is required to tip the balance of probabilities in favor of forgery. The court found that the circumstances surrounding the 2006 will – the defendant’s relationship with the deceased, the timing of the will’s creation coinciding with Nina Wang’s declining health and the large financial transfers – were inherently improbable and contributed significantly to the finding of forgery.

**2. Assessment of Evidence and Witness Credibility:** The court underscored the importance of a meticulous and thorough assessment of evidence in probate disputes. The judge’s detailed examination of the evidence, including the testimony of witnesses, handwriting evidence, and financial records, was praised by the Court of Appeal. The court emphasized that the judge has a wide discretion in assessing witness credibility and that this court will not interfere unless the judge’s assessment was manifestly wrong. The court upheld the judge’s finding that Chan Chun Chuen was untrustworthy and a liar, noting his inconsistent testimony and the fabrication of his educational background. The court also affirmed the judge’s acceptance of the testimony of Mr. Ng Shung Mo and Mr. Winfield Wong, the witnesses who purportedly signed the 2006 will, despite some minor inconsistencies in their accounts.

**3. Handwriting Evidence and Statistical Analysis:** The case provides a detailed analysis of the principles governing the admissibility and weight of handwriting evidence. The court acknowledged the complexities of handwriting analysis and the potential for subjective interpretation. However, it upheld the judge’s reliance on the expert testimony of Mr. Radley, who employed a statistical approach to assess the likelihood of forgery. The court explained and endorsed the concept of "rarities" in handwriting analysis, where the accumulation of unusual features in a questioned signature can indicate forgery. The court rejected the defendant’s argument that Mr. Radley’s approach was flawed or contrary to established principles, finding that the expert’s analysis was sound and supported by the evidence. The court also addressed the issue of the number of comparison signatures used in the analysis, finding that the number used by Mr. Radley was sufficient and appropriate.

**4. The "No-Lose" Argument and Statistical Significance:** The court clarified and endorsed the "no-lose" argument in handwriting analysis, which posits that the sheer number of rare features in a questioned signature, even if individually within a range of variation, can render the signature statistically improbable and indicative of forgery. The court found that the accumulation of rare features in both the Nina Wang and Winfield Wong signatures significantly increased the likelihood of forgery. The court rejected the defendant’s attempt to undermine this argument by focusing on isolated features and arguing that they were within the range of variation.

**5. Inherent Improbabilities and the Weight of Evidence:** The court reiterated that the presence of inherent improbabilities can significantly influence the court’s assessment of the evidence in a forgery case. The court found that the circumstances surrounding the 2006 will – the defendant’s relationship with the deceased, the timing of the will’s creation, the large financial transfers, and the unusual circumstances surrounding its discovery – were inherently improbable and contributed significantly to the finding of forgery. The court emphasized that the judge was entitled to take these inherent improbabilities into account when assessing the credibility of the defendant and the likelihood of forgery.

**6. Costs and Abuse of Process:** The court strongly condemned the defendant’s conduct in presenting a forged will to the court and ordered costs on an indemnity basis, reflecting the egregious abuse of process. The court also ordered the defendant to indemnify the estate for the costs incurred by the Secretary of Justice, who was joined as a party to the action. This demonstrates the court’s willingness to impose significant financial penalties on litigants who engage in dishonest or abusive litigation tactics.



**Novel and Controversial Points:**

*   **Statistical Approach to Handwriting Analysis:** While statistical analysis in handwriting examination isn't entirely new, the court's detailed endorsement and application of the "rarities" and "no-lose" arguments, along with the discussion of the likelihood ratio, provides a significant contribution to the legal understanding of this type of evidence.
*   **Weight of Inherent Improbabilities:** The court’s emphasis on the weight to be given to inherent improbabilities in a forgery case is a notable aspect of the judgment. It reinforces the idea that a court can be more readily persuaded of forgery when the surrounding circumstances are highly suspicious, even if the direct evidence of forgery is not overwhelming.
*   **Costs Order as a Deterrent:** The court’s decision to award costs on an indemnity basis and order the defendant to indemnify the estate for the Secretary of Justice’s costs serves as a strong deterrent against fraudulent litigation and underscores the court’s commitment to protecting the integrity of the judicial process.
