**Facts of the Case**

The case involves two appellants, Stephen Chan Chi Wan and Tseng Pei Kun, who were charged with conspiring to accept an advantage contrary to section 9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (Cap 201) of Hong Kong. Chan was a General Manager (Broadcasting) at Television Broadcasts Ltd (TVB), while Tseng was the sole director and shareholder of Idea Empire Advertising & Production Company Limited (IEAP). IEAP acted as Chan's agent in respect of his outside commercial engagements. In November 2009, Olympian City, a shopping mall operated by Olympian City 2 Management Co Ltd, agreed to sponsor a New Year's Eve Countdown show produced by TVB. As part of the agreement, TVB allowed Chan to host a live, staged edition of his talk show, "Be My Guest," which was part of the Countdown program. Chan was paid $112,000 by IEAP, which was funded by Olympian City, for his appearance on the show.

**Arguments of the Parties**

The prosecution argued that Chan and Tseng conspired to accept an advantage, specifically the $112,000 payment, in relation to their principal's affairs or business, namely TVB. The prosecution claimed that Chan's appearance on the show was an act done in relation to his principal's affairs or business, and that he had not obtained lawful authority or reasonable excuse to accept the payment. The prosecution also argued that Tseng, as Chan's agent, had offered the advantage to Chan as an inducement to or reward for or otherwise on account of his doing or forbearing to do an act in relation to his principal's affairs or business.

The defense argued that Chan's appearance on the show was not an act done in relation to his principal's affairs or business, and that he had a reasonable excuse to accept the payment. The defense also argued that Tseng did not offer the advantage to Chan as an inducement to or reward for or otherwise on account of his doing or forbearing to do an act in relation to his principal's affairs or business.

**Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The Court of Appeal's decision in this case is significant for its interpretation of the mens rea required for an agent to constitute an offense under section 9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance. The court held that the mens rea required for an agent to constitute an offense under section 9 is that the agent must have intended that the act or forbearance would influence or affect the principal's affairs or business.

The court also held that the phrase "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" must be interpreted restrictively, meaning that the agent's act or forbearance must be aimed at and intended to influence or affect the principal's affairs or business. The court rejected the prosecution's argument that the phrase should be interpreted broadly, and that the agent's act or forbearance must simply be related to the principal's affairs or business.

The court also held that the mens rea required for an agent to constitute an offense under section 9 is not limited to the agent's intention to influence or affect the principal's affairs or business directly. The court cited the Privy Council's decision in Commissioner of the ICAC v Ch'ng Poh, which held that the phrase "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" means that the person offering the bribe must have intended the act or forbearance of the agent to influence or affect the principal's affairs.
