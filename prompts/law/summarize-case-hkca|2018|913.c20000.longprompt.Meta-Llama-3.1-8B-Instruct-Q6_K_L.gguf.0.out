**Summary of Facts**

The case of HKSAR v. SO PING CHI involves a public officer, the appellant, who was convicted of misconduct in public office for issuing a non-enforcement instruction to his subordinates in the Marine Department of the Government of the HKSAR. The instruction was to not enforce the provision of children's lifejackets on board vessels licensed before January 2, 2007, as required by the Merchant Shipping (Local Vessels) (Safety and Survey) Regulation. The appellant was the General Manager and Principal Surveyor of Ships of the Local Vessel Safety Branch from April 2007 to August 2010. He issued the instruction in April 2007, and it was not rescinded until after a tragic collision near Lamma Island in October 2012. The prosecution alleged that the appellant's actions were deliberate and serious, and that he had no reasonable excuse or justification for his misconduct. The appellant argued that he had a reasonable excuse for continuing the non-enforcement instruction, citing the need for a smooth implementation of the new lifejacket requirements.

**Summary of Arguments**

The prosecution argued that the appellant's actions were deliberate and serious, and that he had no reasonable excuse or justification for his misconduct. They relied on the evidence of ship inspectors and the appellant's own admissions to establish that he had issued the non-enforcement instruction and failed to rescind it. The prosecution also argued that the appellant's actions were an affront to the standing of the public office held and that he had eroded the public's trust in the Marine Department. The defense argued that the appellant had a reasonable excuse for continuing the non-enforcement instruction, citing the need for a smooth implementation of the new lifejacket requirements. They also argued that the instruction was not serious enough to warrant criminal sanction and that the appellant's actions were not motivated by dishonesty, corruption, or malice.

**Summary of Legal Principles**

The case of HKSAR v. SO PING CHI is a significant decision on the law of misconduct in public office. The Court of Appeal held that the appellant's actions were a clear case of nonfeasance, or breach of duty, and that he had deliberately and seriously misconducted himself by not enforcing the provision of children's lifejackets on board vessels. The court also held that the appellant's actions were not justified by a reasonable excuse or justification, and that he had no authority or legal advice to support his decision to issue the non-enforcement instruction.

The court's decision highlights the importance of the mental element of the offense of misconduct in public office. The court held that the appellant's actions were deliberate and serious, and that he had the means of knowledge available to him to make an assessment of the seriousness of his misconduct. The court also emphasized that the public officer's subjective intention is not a relevant consideration in determining the seriousness of the misconduct.

The case also highlights the distinction between nonfeasance and misfeasance in the context of misconduct in public office. The court held that nonfeasance cases require only a wilful intent, accompanied by the absence of a reasonable excuse or justification, whereas misfeasance cases require an additional element of culpability, such as a dishonest or corrupt motive. The court held that the appellant's actions were a clear case of nonfeasance, and that he had deliberately and seriously misconducted himself by not enforcing the provision of children's lifejackets on board vessels.

The court's decision also emphasizes the importance of the fifth element of the offense of misconduct in public office, which requires that the misconduct be "serious, not trivial, having regard to the responsibilities of the office and the officeholder, the importance of the public objects which they serve and the nature and extent of the departure from those responsibilities." The court held that the appellant's actions were a serious departure from his responsibilities as a public officer, and that he had eroded the public's trust in the Marine Department.

In terms of sentencing, the court held that the appellant's actions warranted a sentence of imprisonment, but that the sentence should take into account the appellant's exemplary character and the fact that he had inherited the policy of not enforcing the Regulation from his predecessor. The court ultimately sentenced the appellant to time already served, which was 4Â½ months' imprisonment.

Overall, the case of HKSAR v. SO PING CHI is a significant decision on the law of misconduct in public office, and highlights the importance of the mental element of the offense, the distinction between nonfeasance and misfeasance, and the importance of the fifth element of the offense. The case also emphasizes the importance of considering the individual circumstances of the case, including the appellant's character and the fact that he had inherited the policy of not enforcing the Regulation from his predecessor.
