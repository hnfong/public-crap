**Part 1: Facts of the Case**

The case of KWOK CHEUK KIN AND ANOTHER v. DIRECTOR OF LANDS AND OTHERS [2021] HKCA 54 concerns the constitutionality of the New Territories Small House Policy (Small House Policy). The Small House Policy was introduced in 1972 and allows indigenous villagers in the New Territories to apply for permission to build a small house on a suitable site within their own village. The policy has undergone several modifications over the years, but its core principles remain the same. The applicants challenged the constitutionality of the Small House Policy on three grounds: discrimination against non-indigenous persons, discrimination against female indigenous villagers, and the Government's failure to manage land for the benefit of all Hong Kong residents. The respondents and the interested party argued that the Small House Policy is protected by Article 40 of the Basic Law (BL40), which stipulates that the lawful traditional rights and interests of indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories shall be protected.

The Small House Policy has three forms of grants: free building license, private treaty grant, and land exchange. The policy has been in place since 1972 and has been recognized in legislation, including the Buildings Ordinance and the Government Rent (Assessment and Collection) Ordinance. The policy has also been recognized in the Joint Declaration, which was signed by the UK and PRC Governments in 1984. The Joint Declaration provides for the protection of land rights and land leases granted by the Hong Kong Government before 1 July 1997.

**Part 2: Arguments of the Parties**

The applicants argued that the Small House Policy is discriminatory against non-indigenous persons and female indigenous villagers, and that it is not protected by BL40. They contended that the policy is not a lawful traditional right or interest of the indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories, as it was not in existence before the New Territories Lease in 1898. The applicants also argued that the policy is not a right or interest that is recognized in the legal system, as it is not a property right or a right to use land.

The respondents and the interested party argued that the Small House Policy is protected by BL40, which stipulates that the lawful traditional rights and interests of indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories shall be protected. They contended that the policy is a lawful traditional right or interest of the indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories, as it is based on the customs and usages of the indigenous inhabitants. The respondents and the interested party also argued that the policy is not discriminatory against non-indigenous persons or female indigenous villagers, as it is a benefit that is available to all indigenous villagers.

**Part 3: Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The Court of Appeal held that the Small House Policy is constitutional and lawful, but only to the extent that it confers benefits on eligible indigenous villagers in the form of free building license. The Court held that the policy is protected by BL40, which stipulates that the lawful traditional rights and interests of indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories shall be protected.

The Court held that the policy is a lawful traditional right or interest of the indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories, as it is based on the customs and usages of the indigenous inhabitants. The Court also held that the policy is not discriminatory against non-indigenous persons or female indigenous villagers, as it is a benefit that is available to all indigenous villagers.

The Court's decision was based on the following legal principles:

1. **Contextual and purposive approach to interpretation**: The Court adopted a contextual and purposive approach to interpreting BL40, taking into account the historical context in which the Basic Law was drafted and the purpose of the provision.
2. **Protection of traditional rights and interests**: The Court held that BL40 protects the traditional rights and interests of indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories, which includes the Small House Policy.
3. **Lawful traditional rights and interests**: The Court held that the Small House Policy is a lawful traditional right or interest of the indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories, as it is based on the customs and usages of the indigenous inhabitants.
4. **Non-discrimination**: The Court held that the Small House Policy is not discriminatory against non-indigenous persons or female indigenous villagers, as it is a benefit that is available to all indigenous villagers.
5. **Coherence principle**: The Court held that BL40 must be read together with other provisions of the Basic Law, including BL120 and BL122, to produce a harmonious and congruous meaning.
6. **CEDAW reservations**: The Court held that the reservations made by the UK and PRC Governments with respect to the application of CEDAW to Hong Kong are a weighty aid to the interpretation of the Basic Law and the BOR, and that BL40 must be construed consistently with these reservations.
7. **Legitimate expectation**: The Court held that an eligible indigenous villager has a right to the determination of their application in accordance with the Small House Policy, which is a legitimate expectation that arises from the Government's policy.

The Court's decision is significant because it upholds the constitutionality of the Small House Policy, which has been in place since 1972. The decision also highlights the importance of considering the historical context and purpose of a provision when interpreting the Basic Law. [end of text]
