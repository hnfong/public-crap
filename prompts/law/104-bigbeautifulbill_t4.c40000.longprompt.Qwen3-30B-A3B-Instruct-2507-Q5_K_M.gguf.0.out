Of this, $4.3 billion is allocated for Offshore Patrol Cutters, $4.3 billion for Polar Security Cutters, $3.5 billion for Arctic Security Cutters, and $1.1425 billion for fixed-wing aircraft. Additional funds include $2.283 billion for rotary-wing aircraft, $4.379 billion for shore facility construction and improvement, and $2.2 billion for depot maintenance of aviation, cutter, and cyber assets. The bill mandates specific allocations for icebreakers, waterways commerce cutters, and autonomous maritime systems, with $816 million for light and medium icebreaking cutters and $75 million for autonomous systems.

**Sec. 40002. Spectrum Auctions.**  
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is granted authority to conduct spectrum auctions through September 30, 2034, excluding the 3.1–3.45 GHz and 7.4–8.4 GHz bands.

The Assistant Secretary of Commerce must identify 500 MHz of Federal-allocated spectrum for reallocation by 2027 (200 MHz) and 2029 (remaining 300 MHz), prioritizing net revenue and feasibility. The Department of Commerce receives $50 million to analyze spectrum value in the 2.7–2.9 GHz, 4.4–4.9 GHz, and 7.25–7.4 GHz bands and publish biennial reports through 2034.

**Sec. 40003. Air Traffic Control Improvements.**  
The FAA is appropriated $12.1 billion for fiscal year 2025, available until September 30, 2029, for modernizing air traffic infrastructure.

The Secretary of Transportation will impose user fees on commercial space launches and reentries starting in 2026, capped at either $0.25 per pound of payload or a flat fee that increases annually. The fee starts at $0.25/lb in 2026 and rises to $1.50/lb by 2033, with annual adjustments based on inflation. Flat fees begin at $30,000 in 2026 and increase to $200,000 by 2033, also adjusted annually. Fees will be deposited into the Office of Commercial Space Transportation Launch and Reentry Licensing and Permitting Fund, with 70% available for FAA operations without further appropriation.

**Sec. 40005. Mars Missions, Artemis Missions, and Moon to Mars Program.**  
NASA receives $9.995 billion for fiscal year 2025, available until September 30, 2032, for Mars and Artemis missions. $700 million is allocated for a competitively bid Mars telecommunications orbiter to support sample return and future missions, to be delivered by December 31, 2028. $2.6 billion funds the Gateway program, $4.1 billion supports the Space Launch System for Artemis IV and V, and $20 million funds Orion crew vehicle procurement for Artemis IV.

**Sec. 40006. Corporate Average Fuel Economy Civil Penalties.**  
The civil penalty for automakers failing to meet corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards is reduced to $0.00 per vehicle, effectively eliminating all penalties. The change applies to all model years for which the Department of Transportation has not yet issued a penalty notification. The amendment takes effect on the date of enactment and nullifies prior penalties under 49 U.S.C. § 32912. This eliminates financial consequences for non-compliance with CAFE standards.

The Airports Authority must pay $3 million annually in 1987 dollars from 1987 to 2026, and $15 million annually in 2027 dollars from 2027 onward. The lease payments must be renegotiated at least every 10 years to ensure they never fall below $15 million in 2027 dollars. The Secretary and Airports Authority are required to ensure the payment level remains stable in real terms. This replaces prior payment terms under 49 U.S.C. § 49104(b).

**Sec. 40008. Rescission of Certain Amounts for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.**

No future use of these funds is permitted.

**Sec. 40011. Rescission of Amounts Appropriated to Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund.**  
$850 million in unobligated balances from the Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund, established under the CHIPS Act of 2022, are permanently rescinded.
