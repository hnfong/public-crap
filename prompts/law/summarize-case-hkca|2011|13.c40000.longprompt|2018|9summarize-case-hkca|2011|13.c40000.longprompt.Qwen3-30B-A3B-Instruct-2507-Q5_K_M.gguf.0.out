### 1. **Brief Summary of the Facts**

The case concerns **So Ping Chi**, a senior public official in Hong Kong’s Marine Department, who was convicted of **misconduct in public office** for failing to enforce a statutory requirement under the *Merchant Shipping (Local Vessels) (Safety and Survey) Regulation* (Cap 548G), specifically the provision mandating that **children’s lifejackets be carried on board certain local vessels**.

The regulation came into force on **2 January 2007**, requiring Class I and IV vessels (such as ferries and yachts) to carry **100% adult lifejackets plus 5% children’s lifejackets**. A 12-month grace period until **1 January 2008** was provided for compliance. However, prior to this, vessels were only required to carry lifejackets for 40% of passengers, with no specific requirement for children’s lifejackets.

So Ping Chi, as General Manager and Principal Surveyor of the Local Vessel Safety Branch (LVSB), **issued an instruction in April 2007**—continuing a policy initiated by his predecessor—that the new lifejacket requirements **did not apply to vessels licensed before 2 January 2007** ("old vessels"). This effectively **exempted thousands of vessels** from the new safety rules, despite the law applying uniformly to all vessels operating in Hong Kong waters.

The instruction was **not rescinded during So’s tenure** (April 2007 – August 2010), and it remained in place even after his departure, continuing under two successors. It was only **rescinded in 2012**, following a **tragic ferry collision near Lamma Island** that killed 39 people. The incident prompted a Commission of Inquiry, which uncovered the non-enforcement policy.

So was arrested, tried, and convicted by a judge on **one count of misconduct in public office**, punishable under common law and section 101I(1) of the *Criminal Procedure Ordinance*. He was sentenced to **16 months’ imprisonment**. He appealed both conviction and sentence.

### 2. **Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties**

#### **Prosecution (Respondent) – HKSAR’s Position:**
- The appellant **deliberately and wilfully failed to enforce a law enacted by the legislature**, substituting his own judgment for that of Parliament.
- The instruction was **not a temporary or limited policy**, but a **blanket, open-ended exemption** affecting a large number of vessels.
- The failure to rescind the instruction over **three years** demonstrated **serious misconduct**, not mere negligence.
- The **public trust in the civil service** was undermined, especially given the **life-or-death nature of maritime safety**.
- The **absence of a corrupt or malicious motive** does not excuse the seriousness of the breach; **wilful non-enforcement of a public duty is sufficient** for criminal liability.
- The **appellant had no authority to exempt vessels** from the law; only the Director of Marine could do so, and he did not consult his superior or seek legal advice.
- The **"smooth implementation"** argument was not a reasonable excuse—**public safety cannot be compromised for administrative convenience**.

#### **Defence (Appellant) – So Ping Chi’s Position:**
- There was **insufficient evidence** to prove **when** the instruction was issued or **what its exact terms were**.
- The **appellant did not act with a dishonest, corrupt, or malicious motive**—his intent was to **ease the financial burden on the shipping industry** and ensure **gradual compliance**.
- The **new law made little practical difference in safety**, as existing lifejackets were **suitable for both adults and children**, and the old system already provided adequate life-saving equipment.
- The **non-enforcement policy was inherited** from his predecessor and continued by his successors—**he was not the originator**, and others were not prosecuted.
- The **sentence of 16 months was disproportionate**, especially given his **exemplary character, long service, and lack of personal gain**.
- The **criminal law should not be used for administrative or policy disagreements**, especially when the **consequences were not demonstrably harmful**.

### 3. **Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) – Detailed and Thorough Analysis**

The case of *HKSAR v So Ping Chi* is a landmark decision in Hong Kong’s criminal law, particularly in clarifying the **scope and application of the offence of misconduct in public office**, especially in cases of **nonfeasance** (failure to act) rather than misfeasance (improper performance of duty). The Court of Appeal’s judgment, delivered by Vice President Macrae, provides a **nuanced and authoritative interpretation** of the offence, resolving key doctrinal tensions and setting important precedents.

#### **A. The Nature of Misconduct in Public Office: Nonfeasance vs. Misfeasance**

The central legal issue revolves around the **distinction between nonfeasance and misfeasance**, a distinction first articulated by **Sir Anthony Mason NPJ in *Shum Kwok Sher v HKSAR* (2002)**. The Court in *So Ping Chi* reaffirms and clarifies this distinction with precision.

- **Nonfeasance** refers to the **failure to perform a public duty**. In such cases, the public officer is not exercising a power or discretion, but simply **not doing what the law requires**.
- **Misfeasance**, by contrast, involves the **lawful exercise of a power or discretion**, but in a way that is **improper, corrupt, or malicious**—for example, using authority to benefit oneself or harm another.

The Court emphasizes that **nonfeasance is not automatically culpable**—it must be **wilful and serious** to attract criminal sanction. However, **the threshold for seriousness is high**, and **a dishonest, corrupt, or malicious motive is not required** for the offence to be established.

This is a **crucial point of law**. The defence argued that **without such a motive**, the conduct could not be “culpable misconduct.” The Court rejected this, stating that **the law does not require an improper motive in nonfeasance cases**. Instead, the **seriousness of the breach**—in terms of **the nature of the duty, the public importance of the object, and the extent of the departure from duty**—is what determines culpability.

#### **B. The Role of Wilfulness: Deliberate vs. Inadvertent Conduct**

The Court defines **“wilful”** in the context of misconduct in public office as **“deliberate and not inadvertent”**. This is not merely about intent to harm, but about **conscious decision-making**.

In this case, the judge found that So Ping Chi **deliberately issued the instruction** and **failed to rescind it**, despite having the power and opportunity to do so. The Court upheld this finding, noting that:
- The instruction was **not a one-off mistake** but a **continuing policy**.
- There was **no evidence of forgetfulness or oversight**.
- The appellant **did not consult his superior or seek legal advice**, despite knowing he lacked authority to exempt vessels.

The Court further clarified that **the prosecution does not need to prove the defendant’s subjective belief about the consequences**. Instead, the test is whether the **defendant had the means of knowledge** to assess the seriousness of the misconduct. If a **right-thinking member of the public** would conclude that the conduct was serious, then the **defendant is deemed to have known**—even if he personally believed otherwise.

This principle was affirmed by reference to *R v Chapman* [2015] QB 883 and *HKSAR v Tsang Yam Kuen* [2018] 3 HKLRD 564, where the Court held that **the jury assesses seriousness based on objective standards**, not the defendant’s private views.

#### **C. The Threshold of Seriousness: The “Fifth Element” of the Offence**

The Court reaffirms the **five elements** of misconduct in public office as refined by Sir Anthony Mason in *Sin Kam Wah v HKSAR* (2005):
1. The defendant was a public officer.
2. He performed or failed to perform a public duty.
3. The conduct was wilful.
4. The conduct was not trivial.
5. The misconduct was serious, having regard to the responsibilities of the office, the public objects served, and the nature and extent of the departure.

The **fifth element**—seriousness—is the **most critical** in determining whether criminal sanction is warranted. The Court emphasizes that **seriousness is not measured by the actual harm caused**, but by **the gravity of the breach of duty and the public trust involved**.

In this case, the Court found that:
- The **duty was of paramount importance**: ensuring maritime safety for the public.
- The **appellant held a senior position** with direct responsibility for enforcement.
- The **non-enforcement affected thousands of vessels** and lasted **over three years**.
- The **public had a reasonable expectation** that safety laws were being enforced, even if they were unaware of the details.

Thus, the **mere fact that the safety outcome may not have been worse under the old system** does not excuse the breach. As the Court stated:  
> “It is not for the defendant to supplant the decision of the legislature and decide himself that the new lifejacket requirements were just the same as the old ones…”

This is a **novel and controversial principle**: **the law does not permit public officials to judge the practical efficacy of legislation**. Even if a law seems redundant or burdensome, **the duty to enforce it remains absolute** unless formally suspended or amended.

#### **D. The Absence of a Reasonable Excuse: The “Smooth Implementation” Defence**

The appellant argued that his conduct was justified by the need to **ensure “smooth implementation”** of the new law, to avoid financial hardship on the industry.

The Court **rejected this as a reasonable excuse**, stating that:
- **Public safety cannot be sacrificed for administrative convenience**.
- The **“smooth implementation”** argument is self-defeating: if the law is not being implemented, it is not being implemented at all.
- The appellant **had no authority to exempt vessels**; only the Director of Marine could do so, and he did not seek approval.
- There was **no evidence** that he instructed inspectors to gradually bring vessels into compliance—**he simply ignored the law**.

This reinforces a **key principle**: **a public officer cannot justify non-enforcement by claiming it is “practical” or “necessary”**. The **legislative will must be respected**, even if it is inconvenient.

#### **E. The Role of Precedent and Inherited Policy**

A **particularly striking aspect** of the legal reasoning is the Court’s treatment of the **fact that the policy was inherited** from the predecessor. The Court acknowledges that the **appellant did not originate the policy**, and that **two successors continued it**. Yet, **only he was prosecuted criminally**.

This raises **serious questions about fairness and consistency**. The Court notes that **no criminal proceedings were brought against the predecessor or successors**, despite their continued complicity. The Court observes that **“there was nothing to distinguish the applicant, morally or legally, from those who succeeded him”**.

Despite this, the Court **does not quash the conviction**, because So Ping Chi **had the opportunity and power to stop the policy** and **chose not to**. The fact that others did not face criminal charges is **not a defence**, but it **does become a critical factor in sentencing**.

This highlights a **tension in the law**: while **individual responsibility** is paramount, **systemic failures** and **institutional culture** may be overlooked in criminal prosecutions.

### 4. **Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case**

Several aspects of this case are **striking, unusual, or deeply remarkable**, both legally and socially.

#### **1. The Appellant Was Not the Originator of the Policy**
This is **unusual in criminal law**: a senior official is prosecuted for **continuing a policy** that was **already in place before he arrived**. The Court acknowledges this, yet still finds him criminally liable. This raises **questions about fairness and proportionality**—why was he the only one prosecuted?

#### **2. The Policy Was Continued by Successors, Yet They Were Not Prosecuted**
The Court notes that **two successors continued the non-enforcement policy**, and **only they were disciplined (with warning letters)**. This **inconsistency in enforcement** is **remarkable** and **undermines the legitimacy of the prosecution**. It suggests that **the criminal law was used selectively**, possibly to send a message rather than to achieve justice.

#### **3. The Sentence Was Overturned on the Basis of Fairness, Not Law**
The **most extraordinary twist** is that while the **conviction was upheld**, the **sentence was reduced to time already served**—**six months**—because:
- The appellant had **no corrupt motive**.
- He was **an exemplary civil servant**.
- His **colleagues were not prosecuted**.

This is **rare**: a criminal conviction upheld, but the **punishment nullified** due to **procedural and moral unfairness**. It reflects a **deep concern for justice beyond the letter of the law**.

#### **4. The Case Was Triggered by a Tragedy, Not a Crime**
The **non-enforcement policy was not discovered because of a leak or investigation**, but **after a fatal ferry collision**. This raises **ethical concerns**: was the law only enforced **after 39 people died**? The case underscores how **public safety laws are often ignored until disaster strikes**.

#### **5. The Legal Principle That “You Can’t Judge the Law”**
The Court’s assertion that **a public officer cannot decide that a law is unnecessary or ineffective**—even if it seems redundant—is **profound and controversial**. It affirms the **supremacy of the legislature** over administrative judgment. But it also **limits the flexibility of public officials** in implementing complex laws.

---

### **Conclusion**

*HKSAR v So Ping Chi* is a **landmark case** that clarifies the **criminal liability of public officials for non-enforcement of law**, even in the absence of corrupt motives. It affirms that **wilful nonfeasance**, when serious and widespread, **can attract criminal sanction**. Yet, it also reveals **deep tensions in the criminal justice system**: **selective prosecution**, **institutional complicity**, and the **difficulty of balancing legal principle with moral fairness**.

The case is **remarkable not just for its legal reasoning**, but for **what it reveals about the culture of public service, the limits of administrative discretion, and the price of public trust**. [end of text]
