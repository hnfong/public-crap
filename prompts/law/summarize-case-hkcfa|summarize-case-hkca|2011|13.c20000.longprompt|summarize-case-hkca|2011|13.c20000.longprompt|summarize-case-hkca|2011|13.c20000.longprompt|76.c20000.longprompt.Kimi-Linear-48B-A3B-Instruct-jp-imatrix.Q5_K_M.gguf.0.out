### 1. Brief Summary of Facts

The case involves a dispute over the validity of a will following the death of Mrs. Nina Wang in 2007. The Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd. (the Foundation) initiated probate proceedings to validate the 2002 will, which names the Foundation as the sole beneficiary. The Applicant, Chan Chun Chuen, counterclaimed, seeking to validate a 2006 will that would entitle him to the entire estate. The trial judge, Lam J, found the 2006 will to be a forgery, a decision upheld by the Court of Appeal. The Applicant now seeks leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal (CFA), arguing that the Court of Appeal erred in its findings and that the case raises issues of public importance.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**Applicant's Arguments:**
- **As of Right Ground:** The Applicant claims entitlement to leave to appeal as of right under section 22(1)(a) of the Court of Final Appeal Ordinance, arguing that the case involves a claim or question respecting property exceeding $1 million. He contends that the appeal involves an indirect claim to the estate, similar to cases like *Wang Din Shin* and *Re Estate of Mui Yim Fong*, where the outcome would result in the applicant receiving the entire estate.
- **Discretionary Ground:** The Applicant also seeks leave on the basis that the case raises a question of great general or public importance, particularly regarding the Court's practice on reviewing concurrent findings of fact. He argues that the Court should reconsider its reluctance to interfere with concurrent findings, citing cases from other Commonwealth jurisdictions.

**Foundation's Arguments:**
- **As of Right Ground:** The Foundation反驳s that the Applicant's claim is not a claim to property or a proprietary right but merely a challenge to the validity of a will. It argues that the Applicant's claim does not meet the "immediacy requirement" under section 22(1)(a), as the financial consequences of validating the 2006 will are not immediately quantifiable without further adjudication on issues like whether the 2006 will is a partial or full will.
- **Discretionary Ground:** The Foundation supports the Court's established practice of refusing to review concurrent findings of fact unless there is a miscarriage of justice or a violation of legal principles. It contends that the Applicant has not provided a reasonably arguable basis for overturning the trial judge's and Court of Appeal's findings, which were based on cogent evidence and thorough analysis.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The case primarily addresses the criteria for granting leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal under section 22(1) of the Court of Final Appeal Ordinance, specifically focusing on the "as of right" and discretionary grounds.

**A. As of Right Ground (Section 22(1)(a))**
- **Claim to Property or Proprietary Right:** The Court clarified that the second limb of section 22(1)(a) applies to claims that are "directly or indirectly" to property or a proprietary right. The Applicant's claim was deemed not to meet this criterion because it was not a direct claim to property but a challenge to the validity of a will. The Court emphasized that the outcome of the appeal must immediately confer a quantifiable financial benefit or detriment, which was not the case here due to unresolved issues like the construction of the 2006 will.
- **Immediacy Requirement:** The Court stressed that the order sought must have an immediate financial impact without further adjudication. In this case, validating the 2006 will would not immediately resolve the Applicant's entitlement, as the court would still need to determine whether the 2006 will was a partial or full will, making the financial consequences unquantifiable at the appeal stage.

**B. Discretionary Ground (Section 22(1)(b))**
- **Practice on Concurrent Findings:** The Court reaffirmed its established practice of refusing to interfere with concurrent findings of fact by the trial judge and Court of Appeal unless there is a miscarriage of justice or a violation of legal principles. This practice is rooted in policy considerations, including the efficient administration of justice and the proper distribution of judicial functions among lower courts.
- **Public Importance:** The Applicant's argument that the case raises a question of public importance regarding the review of concurrent findings was rejected. The Court found no reasonably arguable basis for reconsidering its practice, noting that such a change would undermine the finality of judgments and impose unnecessary burdens on the Court's resources.

**C. New Evidence Ground**
- The Applicant's attempt to introduce fresh evidence (Police statements) to challenge the credibility of a key witness was also rejected. The Court found that the evidence did not materially affect the central findings and did not constitute a reasonable basis for overturning the concurrent findings.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

- **As of Right Appeal for Probate Dispute:** The case is notable for the Applicant's attempt to secure leave to appeal as of right in a probate dispute, which is unusual given that such appeals are typically granted only for liquidated monetary claims. The Court's rejection of this argument underscores the narrow interpretation of the "as of right" ground in non-monetary disputes.
- **Public Importance of Concurrent Findings Practice:** The Applicant's focus on the Court's practice regarding concurrent findings of fact highlights a broader debate about the finality of judgments and the role of the Court of Final Appeal. The Court's refusal to reconsider this practice, despite its potential public importance, reflects a commitment to judicial efficiency and the hierarchical structure of the court system.
- **Role of Fresh Evidence:** The case illustrates the stringent requirements for introducing fresh evidence on appeal, particularly in cases involving concurrent findings of fact. The Court's skepticism towards the Applicant's new evidence demonstrates the high threshold for such applications, especially when the evidence pertains to witness credibility and does not directly undermine the trial judge's findings.

### Final Answer

**1. Brief Summary of Facts:**
The case concerns a dispute over the validity of a will following the death of Mrs. Nina Wang in 2007. The Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd. sought to validate the 2002 will, which names the Foundation as the sole beneficiary. The Applicant, Chan Chun Chuen, counterclaimed to validate a 2006 will that would entitle him to the entire estate. The trial judge found the 2006 will to be a forgery, a decision upheld by the Court of Appeal. The Applicant now seeks leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal.

**2. Arguments of the Parties:**
- **Applicant:** Argued for leave to appeal as of right under section 22(1)(a), claiming the case involves a claim to property exceeding $1 million. Also sought discretionary leave, arguing the case raises a question of public importance regarding the review of concurrent findings of fact.
- **Foundation:** Contended that the Applicant's claim is not a claim to property but a challenge to a will's validity. Argued that the "immediacy requirement" under section 22(1)(a) is not met, as validating the 2006 will would not immediately resolve the Applicant's entitlement. Supported the Court's practice of refusing to review concurrent findings unless there is a miscarriage of justice.

**3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi):**
- **As of Right Ground:** The Court held that the Applicant's claim does not qualify as a claim to property or a proprietary right under section 22(1)(a) because it is a challenge to a will's validity. The "immediacy requirement" was not satisfied, as the financial consequences of validating the 2006 will are unquantifiable without further adjudication.
- **Discretionary Ground:** The Court reaffirmed its practice of refusing to interfere with concurrent findings of fact unless there is a miscarriage of justice or a violation of legal principles. The Applicant failed to provide a reasonably arguable basis for overturning the trial judge's and Court of Appeal's findings, and the case did not raise a question of public importance warranting a departure from this practice.
- **New Evidence Ground:** The Applicant's proposed fresh evidence was deemed insufficient to undermine the central findings, and no miscarriage of justice was established.

**4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects:**
- The Applicant's attempt to secure leave to appeal as of right in a probate dispute, which is typically reserved for monetary claims, is unusual.
- The case highlights the Court's strict approach to reviewing concurrent findings of fact and its reluctance to reconsider established practices, even in cases raising questions of public importance.
- The Court's rejection of the Applicant's fresh evidence application underscores the high threshold for such requests, particularly when the evidence pertains to witness credibility and does not directly challenge the trial judge's findings. [end of text]
