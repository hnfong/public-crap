Got it, let's tackle this. The user wants summaries for every section starting with 71101, each 1-4 sentences, specific with parties, entities, quantities. First, I need to go through each section provided and extract the key points: what it does, who it affects, dates, amounts, etc.

Starting with Sec. 71101: Moratorium on Medicare Savings Programs rule implementation. The text says HHS can't implement certain CMS rules from Sept 2023 through Sept 2034, and appropriates $1M for 2026 to CMS for this. So I need to include the moratorium period, the rule cited, and the funding.

Sec. 71102: Similar to 71101 but for Medicaid/CHIP/Basic Health Program. CMS can't implement April 2024 rules until Sept 2034, lists specific CFR parts/sections. No new funding mentioned here, just the moratorium.

Sec. 71103: Reducing duplicate Medicaid/CHIP enrollment. States must start in 2027 getting address info from reliable sources (USPS, managed care) and by 2029 submit SSNs/month to a new CMS system to prevent multiple State enrollments. Appropriates $10M (2026) and $20M (2029) to CMS for the system. Also amends CHIP to include these requirements.
