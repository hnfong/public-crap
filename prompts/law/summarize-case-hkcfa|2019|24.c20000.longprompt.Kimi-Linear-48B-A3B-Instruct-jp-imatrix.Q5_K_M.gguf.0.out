### 1. Brief Summary of Facts

The case concerns **Donald Tsang Yam-kuen**, former Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), who was charged with two offences:

- **Count 1 (Bribery)**: Accepting an advantage (the refurbishment and re-decoration of a Shenzhen property) as an inducement or reward for his handling of broadcasting licence applications for a company controlled by Wong Cho-bau, a mainland businessman.
- **Count 2 (Misconduct in Public Office)**: Failing to disclose or concealing his dealings with Wong Cho-bau regarding the Shenzhen property when he was involved in the ExCo (Executive Council) decision-making process on the broadcasting applications.

The jury convicted Tsang on Count 2 but could not reach a verdict on Count 1. The Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal against conviction but reduced his sentence. The final appeal to the **Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal (HKCFA)** centred on whether the trial judge’s directions to the jury on the elements of misconduct in public office were adequate, particularly when the jury had acquitted on the bribery charge but convicted on the misconduct charge.

### 2. Summary of Arguments

#### **Prosecution’s Position**
- **Primary Case (Corruption)**: The prosecution argued that the refurbishment and re-decoration of the Shenzhen property was a **bribe** given in exchange for favourable treatment of the broadcasting licence applications. The non-disclosure was deliberate and intended to conceal this corrupt arrangement.
- **Alternative Case (Non-Corrupt Impropriety)**: If the jury did not accept the bribery charge, the prosecution still argued that Tsang’s failure to disclose his dealings with Wong Cho-bau constituted **misconduct in public office**, even if no corruption was proven. They claimed this was a serious abuse of office, regardless of whether the dealings were corrupt.

#### **Defence’s Position**
- **No Corruption**: The defence argued the dealings were **arm’s-length and commercial**, with no improper benefit to Tsang. The rent was at market rate, and the renovations were for his own residence after retirement.
- **No Misconduct**: Even if there was a duty to disclose, the non-disclosure was not **wilful misconduct** or sufficiently serious to warrant criminal liability. It was an **error of judgment**, not deliberate concealment.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The HKCFA’s judgment is a **comprehensive exposition of the common law offence of misconduct in public office**, particularly in the context of **non-disclosure of conflicts of interest**. Key legal principles include:

#### **A. Elements of Misconduct in Public Office**
The Court reaffirmed the five elements from *Shum Kwok Sher v HKSAR*:
1. **Public official** (Tsang was Chief Executive and ExCo President).
2. **In the course of public office** (decision-making on broadcasting licences).
3. **Wilful misconduct** (deliberate act or omission, not mere oversight).
4. **Without reasonable excuse** (e.g., error of judgment).
5. **Seriousness** (not trivial; must involve culpability).

#### **B. Wilfulness vs. Deliberate Concealment**
- **Wilfulness** requires proof that the official **knew or disregarded the risk** that their conduct was unlawful (per *Sin Kam Wah v HKSAR*).
- **Deliberate concealment** implies **dishonesty** and **knowledge of wrongdoing**, not just a conscious decision not to disclose.
- The trial judge’s direction that **"overlooking is not enough"** was **misleading** because it equated non-disclosure with deliberate concealment, even if the official genuinely believed no disclosure was required.

#### **C. Seriousness Assessment**
- The Court criticised the trial judge for **failing to guide the jury** on how to assess seriousness when corruption was not proven.
- The jury was left to infer seriousness from **suspicion or conflict of interest**, rather than objective factors like **harm to public trust** or **impact on decision-making**.
- The Court emphasised that **non-disclosure may result from an error of judgment**, not necessarily criminal intent.

#### **D. Separate Consideration of Counts 1 and 2**
- The jury was instructed to consider Counts 1 and 2 **separately**, but the prosecution’s case conflated them by framing Count 2 as a **corollary of bribery**.
- The Court held that **if bribery was not proven**, the jury needed **clear guidance** on whether non-disclosure alone could constitute misconduct, independent of corruption.

#### **E. No Order for Retrial**
- The Court **quashed the conviction** but **refused a retrial** because Tsang had already served his sentence. The public interest in finality outweighed the need for retrial, especially since the bribery charge remained unresolved.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

1. **High-Profile Case**: The defendant was **Donald Tsang**, the **former Chief Executive of Hong Kong**, making this one of the most significant corruption trials in Hong Kong’s history.
2. **Hung Jury on Bribery**: The jury **could not agree on bribery** but **convicted on misconduct**, highlighting the **ambiguity** in the law when no corruption is proven.
3. **Judicial Criticism of Prosecution’s Case**: The HKCFA **criticised the prosecution** for relying on **suspicion and conjecture** rather than concrete evidence of corruption, warning against **"convicting the applicant of an uncharged act."**
4. **No Retrial Despite Guilt**: The Court **refused a retrial** despite convicting on misconduct, due to the **already-served sentence** and **public interest in finality**.
5. **Ambiguity in Legal Direction**: The case underscores the **danger of conflating non-disclosure with concealment**, especially when the underlying conduct is **not proven corrupt**.

---

### **Conclusion**
This case is a **landmark ruling** on the **limits of the common law offence of misconduct in public office**, particularly in **non-disclosure scenarios**. It clarifies that **mere non-disclosure is not enough**; there must be **dishonesty or knowledge of wrongdoing**. The judgment also **restrains prosecutorial overreach** by rejecting cases based on **suspicion rather than proof**. [end of text]
