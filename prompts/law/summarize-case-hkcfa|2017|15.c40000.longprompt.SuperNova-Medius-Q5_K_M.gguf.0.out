### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case involves Stephen Chan Chi Wan, a TVB employee, and Tseng Pei Kun, who acted as Chan's agent for outside commercial engagements. Chan hosted a popular talk show called "Be My Guest" on a TVB pay channel. In 2009, Chan was invited to participate in a live segment of the show during a New Year's Eve Countdown event at Olympian City, a shopping mall. Olympian City agreed to pay Chan's agent, Tseng, $160,000 for Chan's appearance, with Chan receiving $112,000 of that amount. Chan did not seek or obtain permission from TVB for this engagement, despite having a contractual obligation to do so.

The prosecution charged Chan and Tseng with conspiracy to accept an advantage, and with the substantive offenses of accepting and offering an advantage, respectively, under section 9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO). The prosecution argued that Chan's appearance was an act "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" and that the payment was an inducement for him to perform that act.

The trial judge acquitted Chan and Tseng, finding that Chan's appearance was not an act "in relation to his principal's affairs or business." The Court of Appeal reversed this decision, holding that Chan's appearance was indeed an act "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" and that the payment was an inducement for him to perform that act. The appellants then appealed to the Court of Final Appeal.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**Appellants' Arguments:**
- Chan's appearance was not an act "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" because it was a moonlighting activity that did not involve any conflict of interest or harm to TVB.
- The prosecution failed to prove that the payment was intended to influence or affect TVB's affairs or business.
- The Court of Appeal's interpretation of section 9 was overly broad and inconsistent with the Privy Council's decision in Commissioner of ICAC v Ch'ng Poh.
- Chan had a reasonable excuse for accepting the payment, as TVB was aware of and implicitly approved of his appearance.

**Respondent's Arguments:**
- Chan's appearance was an act "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" because it was part of a TVB-produced program and would have influenced TVB's business.
- The payment was an inducement for Chan to perform an act "in relation to his principal's affairs or business," thus satisfying the requirements of section 9.
- The Court of Appeal's interpretation of section 9 was correct and consistent with the purpose of the legislation, which is to prevent agents from being put in positions of temptation.
- The absence of any prejudice to TVB or any conflict of interest does not provide a reasonable excuse for accepting the payment.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**Key Legal Principles:**

1. **Elements of Section 9 Offense:**
   - Section 9 of the POBO criminalizes the solicitation or acceptance of an advantage by an agent as an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do an act "in relation to his principal's affairs or business."
   - The phrase "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" must be interpreted restrictively to mean that the act must be aimed at and intended to influence or affect the principal's affairs or business.

2. **Mens Rea Requirements:**
   - In cases where the agent solicits or accepts an advantage, the prosecution must prove that the agent knew or believed the advantage was provided as an inducement or reward for an act aimed at and intended to influence or affect the principal's affairs or business.
   - In cases where the advantage is offered, the prosecution must prove that the offeror intended the advantage to be accepted as an inducement or reward for an act aimed at and intended to influence or affect the principal's affairs or business.

3. **Reasonable Excuse:**
   - Reasonable excuse is a defense to the offense under section 9, and the burden of proving reasonable excuse lies on the accused.
   - A reasonable excuse must be genuine and reasonable, assessed on an objective standard depending on the particular facts of the case.
   - The absence of prejudice to the principal or the fact that the act was beneficial to the principal does not provide a reasonable excuse.

4. **Conspiracy:**
   - The offense of conspiracy to commit an offense under section 9 does not impose a reverse onus on the accused to prove lawful authority or reasonable excuse.
   - The prosecution must prove that the conspirators agreed to pursue a course of conduct that would necessarily amount to or involve the commission of a section 9 offense.

**Novel or Controversial Points:**

- The Court of Final Appeal's interpretation of section 9 as requiring an act that is aimed at and intended to influence or affect the principal's affairs or business, rather than merely being related to the principal's affairs or business.
- The Court's conclusion that the absence of prejudice to the principal or the fact that the act was beneficial to the principal does not provide a reasonable excuse.
- The Court's finding that the reasonable excuse defense is available even in cases of conspiracy, contrary to the prosecution's argument.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case

- **Complexity of the Legal Issues:** The case involved intricate legal questions about the interpretation of section 9 of the POBO, including the meaning of "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" and the scope of the reasonable excuse defense.
- **High-Profile Defendants:** The case involved high-profile individuals, including a TV personality and his agent, which added to its public interest and the scrutiny it received.
- **Impact on Employment Law:** The case has implications for the fiduciary obligations of agents and the extent to which their outside activities can be regulated by their principal.
- **Public Policy Considerations:** The case highlights the ongoing efforts to combat corruption in Hong Kong, particularly in the private sector, and the importance of maintaining high standards of integrity in business relationships.
- **Judicial Disagreement:** The case saw a significant disagreement between the Court of Appeal and the Court of Final Appeal, with the latter overturning the former's interpretation of section 9, which underscores the complexity and evolving nature of anti-corruption legislation. 

These aspects make the case a landmark decision in Hong Kong's anti-corruption law, with significant implications for the interpretation and application of section 9 of the POBO. [end of text]
