### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case of Secretary for Justice v Chan Chi Wan Stephen [2017] HKCFA 15 involves Stephen Chan Chi Wan, a TVB employee, and Tseng Pei Kun, who acted as Chan's agent for outside commercial engagements. In 2009, Chan was invited to host a special edition of his talk show, "Be My Guest," as part of a New Year's Eve Countdown event at Olympian City, a shopping mall. Chan accepted a payment of HKD 112,000 from Tseng, who had arranged the appearance on behalf of Olympian City. The payment was made without TVB's approval, although TVB was aware of Chan's participation in the event.

The prosecution charged Chan and Tseng with conspiracy to accept an advantage contrary to section 9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO). The prosecution argued that Chan's appearance on the show was an act "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" and that the payment was an inducement for this act. The trial judge acquitted the appellants, but the Court of Appeal reversed this decision, finding Chan and Tseng guilty of the conspiracy charge.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments

**Prosecution's Argument:**
- The prosecution argued that Chan's appearance on the "Be My Guest" show was an act "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" because it was part of a TVB-produced Countdown event.
- They contended that the payment to Chan was an inducement for an act aimed at TVB's business, as Chan's participation would boost TVB's audience ratings and reputation.
- The prosecution maintained that the absence of any adverse impact on TVB was irrelevant, and that the act of accepting the payment without TVB's permission was sufficient to establish a section 9 offense.

**Defendants' Argument:**
- The defendants argued that Chan's appearance on the show was not an act "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" because it was a moonlighting activity that did not involve any powers or duties of his position at TVB.
- They contended that the payment was made by Olympian City, not TVB, and that TVB had no objection to Chan's participation.
- The defendants also argued that Chan had a reasonable excuse for accepting the payment, as TVB was aware of and implicitly approved of his appearance on the show.

### 3. Summary of the Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**Mens Rea and Actus Reus:**
- The court held that section 9 of the POBO requires proof of mens rea in respect of all its essential actus reus ingredients. The prosecution must prove that the accused knew or believed that the advantage was provided as an inducement or reward for an act aimed at and intended to influence or affect the principal's affairs or business.
- The court clarified that the act or forbearance must be aimed at and intended to influence or affect the principal's affairs or business in a manner that undermines the integrity of the agency relationship.

**Reasonable Excuse:**
- The court held that the defense of reasonable excuse is available to the accused under section 9. The prosecution must prove that the accused did not have a reasonable excuse for accepting the advantage.
- The court emphasized that the reasonable excuse must be genuine and reasonable, assessed on an objective standard depending on the particular facts of the case.

**Interpretation of "In Relation to Principal's Affairs or Business":**
- The court interpreted the phrase "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" to mean that the act or forbearance must be aimed at and intended to influence or affect the principal's affairs or business.
- The court rejected the prosecution's argument that the act must merely be "related to" the principal's affairs or business, emphasizing that the act must be aimed at and intended to influence or affect the principal's affairs or business.

**Prejudice to the Principal:**
- The court held that the act or forbearance must be adverse to the principal's interests, in the sense that it undermines the integrity of the agency relationship by injuring the bond of trust and loyalty between principal and agent.
- The court rejected the prosecution's argument that the absence of any adverse impact on the principal is irrelevant, emphasizing that the act must be aimed at and intended to influence or affect the principal's affairs or business in a manner that undermines the integrity of the agency relationship.

**Burden of Proof in Conspiracy Cases:**
- The court held that in conspiracy cases, the prosecution must prove that the conspirators intended to commit the substantive offense, including the absence of lawful authority or reasonable excuse.
- The court rejected the prosecution's argument that the reverse onus provision in section 24 of the POBO applies to conspiracy cases, emphasizing that the prosecution must prove the substantive elements of the offense, including the absence of lawful authority or reasonable excuse.

**Conclusion:**
- The court allowed the appeals and quashed the appellants' convictions, finding that the prosecution had not established that Chan's appearance on the show was an act "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" and that Chan had a reasonable excuse for accepting the payment. The court also found that the prosecution had not established that Tseng intended to commit the substantive offense of offering an advantage to Chan. 

The case highlights the importance of the mens rea and actus reus elements in section 9 offenses and the need for the prosecution to prove that the act or forbearance was aimed at and intended to influence or affect the principal's affairs or business in a manner that undermines the integrity of the agency relationship. The case also emphasizes the importance of the reasonable excuse defense and the need for the prosecution to prove the absence of lawful authority or reasonable excuse in conspiracy cases.
