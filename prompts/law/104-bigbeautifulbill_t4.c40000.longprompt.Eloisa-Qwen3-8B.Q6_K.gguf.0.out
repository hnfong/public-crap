Okay, the user wants a summary of every section in this bill, starting with Sec. 40001. The bill is quite large, so I need to break it down section by section. Let me start with Sec. 40001, which is about Coast Guard mission readiness. The summary should be concise, specific, and within four sentences. I need to mention the funding amounts, the purpose, and any key entities involved, like the Coast Guard and the appropriations.

Next, Sec. 40002 deals with spectrum auctions. I should highlight the definitions, the auction authority, the identified frequencies, and the timeline for reallocation. Also, note the involvement of the Assistant Secretary and the FCC.

Sec. 40003 is about air traffic control improvements. The funding is substantial, so I need to list the different appropriations and their purposes, like telecommunications infrastructure and radar systems. Mention the FAA Administrator and the specific amounts.

Sec. 40004 involves space launch user fees. The key points are the fees imposed, the schedule, and the fund established. I should specify the fee amounts per year and the percentage allocated for different purposes.

Sec. 40005 is for Mars and Artemis missions. The funding is split into several categories, so I need to outline each part, like the Mars orbiter, Gateway program, Space Launch System, etc. Mention the Administration and the specific obligations.

Sec. 40006 reduces civil penalties for fuel economy. The changes are straightforward: the penalties are set to $0.00. I should note the sections amended and the effective date.

Sec. 40007 adjusts lease payments for Washington airports. The amounts are specified for different years, and there's a renegotiation clause. Mention the Airports Authority and the Secretary.

Sec. 40008 rescinds unobligated funds for NOAA. I need to clarify that it's the unobligated balances from previous appropriations that are rescinded.

Sec. 40009 reduces transfers to the Travel Promotion Fund. The amendment changes the amount from $100M to $20M. Note the specific section and the effective date.

Sec. 40010 rescinds unobligated funds for alternative fuel aviation tech. Link it to the previous section's funding and specify the rescinded amount.

Sec. 40011 rescinds funds for the Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund. Mention the specific amount and that it's permanent.

I need to ensure each summary is under four sentences, specific, and includes all key details. Avoid vague terms and stick to the exact figures and entities mentioned in the bill. Also, check that I start with Sec. 40001 and proceed in order without skipping any sections. Make sure the language is clear and concise, avoiding any markdown formatting as instructed.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is authorized to auction 300 megahertz of spectrum in the 3.98–4.2 GHz band by 2026, with additional 500 megahertz identified for reallocation by the Assistant Secretary of Commerce.
