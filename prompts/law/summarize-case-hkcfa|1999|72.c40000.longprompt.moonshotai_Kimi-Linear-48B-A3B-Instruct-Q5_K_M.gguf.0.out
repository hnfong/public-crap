### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts

The case **Ng Ka Ling and Others v. Director of Immigration** concerns the interpretation and application of **Article 24(2) and 24(3)** of the **Hong Kong Basic Law**, which defines permanent residents and their right of abode in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). The appellants—**Miss Ng Ka Ling, Miss Ng Tan Tan, Mr. Tsui Kuen Nang, and Miss Cheung Lai Wah**—are Chinese nationals born in mainland China. Each had a parent who was a Hong Kong permanent resident at the time of their birth, qualifying them under **Article 24(2)(3)** as permanent residents with the right of abode in Hong Kong.

However, the **Director of Immigration** refused to recognize their right of abode, arguing that they were subject to a **scheme introduced by the Immigration (Amendment) (No. 3) Ordinance 1997**, which required them to hold a **one-way permit** (issued by mainland authorities) and a **certificate of entitlement** (issued by the Director) before they could enjoy their constitutional right of abode. The Director also argued that **Article 22(4)** of the Basic Law, which requires mainland residents to obtain approval to enter Hong Kong, justified this scheme.

The applicants challenged the Director’s decisions in the courts, ultimately reaching the **Court of Final Appeal (CFA)** of Hong Kong. The central legal questions were:
- Whether the **No. 3 Ordinance** was constitutional.
- Whether **Article 22(4)** qualified the right of abode under **Article 24(3)**.
- Whether the **retrospective application** of the No. 3 Ordinance was lawful.
- Whether **discrimination against children born out of wedlock** in the definition of parent-child relationships was constitutional.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments

#### **Appellants’ Arguments:**
- The applicants are **permanent residents** under **Article 24(2)(3)** and thus have the **right of abode** under **Article 24(3)**.
- The **No. 3 Ordinance** is **unconstitutional** because it imposes an **additional requirement** (one-way permit + certificate of entitlement) beyond what the Basic Law guarantees.
- **Article 22(4)** does **not** qualify the right of abode under Article 24(3) because permanent residents are **not "people from other parts of China"** seeking entry for settlement.
- The **retrospective provision** in the No. 3 Ordinance is **unconstitutional** as it violates **Article 15(1) of the ICCPR** (non-retroactivity of criminal laws).
- The **discrimination against illegitimate children** in **para. 1(2)(b) of Schedule 1** is **unconstitutional** under **Article 25 (equality)** and **Article 23(1) (family rights)** of the ICCPR.

#### **Director’s Arguments:**
- The **No. 3 Ordinance** is constitutional because **Article 22(4)** allows the central government to control entry for settlement, and permanent residents are still subject to **exit approval** from mainland authorities.
- The **retrospective provision** is valid because it applies only to those who **arrived after 1 July 1997** (the day of handover).
- The **discrimination against illegitimate children** is justified because it aligns with **existing mainland practices** and **Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) agreements**.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

#### **A. Jurisdiction of Hong Kong Courts to Interpret the Basic Law**
- The **Court of Final Appeal (CFA)** has the **constitutional authority** to interpret the Basic Law and strike down inconsistent legislation (para. 61–70).
- The **Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (NPCSC)** has **final interpretative power** over **excluded provisions** (those concerning central government affairs or relations between central and regional authorities) under **Article 158(3)**.
- However, the **CFA is not obliged to refer** a case to the NPCSC if the **predominant provision being interpreted is not an excluded one**, even if an excluded provision is **arguably relevant** (para. 99–105).

#### **B. Interpretation of Article 24(2)(3) and the Right of Abode**
- **Article 24(3)** grants **unqualified right of abode** to permanent residents.
- The **right of abode** includes the **right to land** and **reside** in Hong Kong without conditions (para. 109–114).
- **Article 22(4)** does **not** apply to permanent residents because they are **not "people from other parts of China"** seeking entry for settlement—they are **already part of Hong Kong’s constitutional order**.
- The **scheme introduced by the No. 3 Ordinance** (requiring a one-way permit and certificate of entitlement) is **unconstitutional** to the extent it **restricts the right of abode** of permanent residents (para. 119–121).

#### **C. Severability and Constitutional Invalidity**
- The **unconstitutional parts** of the No. 3 Ordinance (the one-way permit requirement) can be **severed** while preserving the rest (para. 122–130).
- The **retrospective provision** (section 1(2)) is **unconstitutional** because it violates **Article 15(1) of the ICCPR** (para. 132–142).

#### **D. Discrimination Against Illegitimate Children**
- **Para. 1(2)(b) of Schedule 1** is **unconstitutional** because it **discriminates against children born out of wedlock** by requiring legitimation for a father-child relationship to exist (para. 143–155).
- The **Basic Law and ICCPR** require **equal treatment** of legitimate and illegitimate children.
- The **Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) agreement** does not override the **constitutional guarantee of equality**.

#### **E. Legality of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC)**
- The **Provisional Legislative Council (PLC)** was **constitutionally established** under the **1990 Decision** of the NPC, which authorized the Preparatory Committee to form the first legislature (para. 156–171).
- The PLC was **not the first Legislative Council** under the Basic Law but was a **temporary body** created to avoid legislative vacuum, and its actions were **consistent with the Basic Law**.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

- **Unprecedented Judicial Scrutiny of Mainland Authority:** The CFA **directly challenged** the **mainland’s exit control system** (one-way permits) as **infringing on Hong Kong’s constitutional autonomy**, marking a **rare instance** where a Hong Kong court **overrode mainland administrative practices**.
- **Severance of Unconstitutional Provisions:** The court **severed multiple provisions** (including the one-way permit requirement and retrospective application) while **preserving the rest** of the legislation, demonstrating **surgical precision** in constitutional interpretation.
- **Discrimination Against Illegitimate Children:** The case **struck down** a **centuries-old common law presumption** (legitimacy-based paternal rights) as **unconstitutional**, aligning Hong Kong’s laws with **modern human rights standards**.
- **NPCSC’s Limited Role:** The court **rejected** the Director’s argument that **Article 22(4)** qualified the right of abode, **asserting Hong Kong’s autonomy** over immigration rights of its permanent residents.
- **Retrospective Invalidity:** The court **struck down** a **retrospective criminal provision** under the ICCPR, **setting a precedent** for **human rights protections** in Hong Kong’s legal system.

### **Conclusion**
This case is a **landmark ruling** that **reaffirmed Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy** under the Basic Law, **struck down discriminatory laws**, and **established clear limits** on the influence of mainland administrative practices over Hong Kong’s constitutional rights. It remains a **cornerstone of Hong Kong’s constitutional jurisprudence**. [end of text]
