Okay, the user wants a summary of every section in this big tax bill, starting with Sec. 70401. They specified to keep it concise, with at most one paragraph and four sentences per section. I need to make sure I'm specific about parties, entities, and quantities without being vague.

First, I'll look at Sec. 70401. It's about enhancing the employer-provided child care credit. The main changes are increasing the percentage from 25% to 40% for eligible small businesses, raising the credit limit, and adding details about eligible small businesses and third-party intermediaries. I should mention the effective date too.

Next, Sec. 70402 enhances the adoption credit. It adds a refundable portion and adjusts inflation. I need to note the new credit amount and the effective dates.
