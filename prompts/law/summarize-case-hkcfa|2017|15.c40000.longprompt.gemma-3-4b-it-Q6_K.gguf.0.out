Okay, here’s a breakdown of the *Secretary for Justice v. Chan Chi Wan Stephen* case, addressing your three requests with a detailed and thorough response:

**1. Summary of the Facts**

The case revolves around Stephen Chan Chi Wan, a General Manager at Television Broadcasts Ltd (TVB), who hosted a popular talk show segment called “Be My Guest.”  This segment, gaining significant popularity, led to Chan being paid by third parties – specifically, Olympian City 2 Management Co Ltd (OC) and its agent, Idea Empire Advertising & Production Company Limited (IEAP) – to appear at external events.  OC wanted to integrate “Be My Guest” into their New Year’s Eve Countdown show at Olympian City.  They agreed to pay TVB $1.3 million for the show, but acknowledged that this wouldn’t cover the cost of Chan’s appearance.  OC then contracted IEAP to secure Chan’s participation, paying IEAP $160,000, which was then passed on to Chan ($112,000) and another guest, Lai Yiu Cheung ($20,000).  Chan did not seek TVB’s permission for this outside work, despite a contractual obligation to do so.  The prosecution charged Chan with accepting an advantage (the $112,000) in violation of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO), arguing it was an inducement for him to participate in the Countdown show, which benefited TVB.  The case went through multiple appeals, with the trial judge initially acquitting Chan, and the Court of Appeal overturning that decision, finding that Chan’s appearance *did* relate to TVB’s affairs and business.  The Court of Appeal then convicted Chan and Tseng Pei Kun (IEAP’s director) on the conspiracy charge.



**2. Summary of the Arguments**

*   **Prosecution (Secretary for Justice):** The prosecution argued that Chan’s appearance in the “Be My Guest” segment was a direct benefit to TVB’s business interests.  They contended that the Countdown show, featuring Chan, was designed to boost TVB’s viewership and promote Olympian City, thus directly impacting TVB’s affairs.  They emphasized that Chan’s participation was not a purely personal endeavor but was strategically aligned with TVB’s promotional goals.  The prosecution relied heavily on the reasoning of the Court of Appeal, asserting that the segment’s integration into the Countdown show established a clear link between Chan’s actions and TVB’s business.  They also argued that Chan’s failure to obtain TVB’s permission for the outside work constituted a breach of his contractual obligations and a deliberate attempt to circumvent company policy.

*   **Defense (Chan & Tseng):** The defense argued that Chan’s appearance was a purely personal activity, unrelated to TVB’s business. They contended that the “Be My Guest” show was a celebrity venture, and Chan’s participation was driven by his own popularity and not by any intention to influence or benefit TVB.  They highlighted that the segment was conceived independently by OC and TVB, and that Chan’s involvement was simply a result of his celebrity status.  The defense successfully argued that the segment’s inclusion in the Countdown show was coincidental and did not constitute an act “in relation to his principal’s affairs or business.”  They invoked the precedent set in *Commissioner of the ICAC v Ch’ng Poh*, arguing that the prosecution needed to prove that the advantage was offered with the intention of influencing or affecting the principal’s affairs, not merely that the act was related to those affairs.



**3. Summary of Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The core of this case hinges on interpreting the crucial phrase “in relation to his principal’s affairs or business” within the context of section 9 of the POBO. The Court of Appeal’s decision significantly shifted the burden of proof, and the subsequent appeals focused on refining this interpretation. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

*   **The Broad Interpretation of “In Relation To”:** The Court of Appeal rejected the prosecution’s attempt to establish a narrow interpretation of the phrase, arguing that it should be understood broadly.  They followed the reasoning in *Commissioner of the ICAC v Ch’ng Poh*, stating that the prosecution only needed to prove that the agent’s act or forbearance was intended to influence or affect the principal’s affairs.  The key is the *intention* of the agent, not simply the fact that the act occurred in relation to the principal’s business.

*   **The Importance of “Aiming At”:**  The Court of Appeal emphasized the concept of “aiming at” the principal’s affairs.  Lord Lloyd of Berwick, in *Ch’ng Poh*, articulated this principle, stating that the advantage offered must be “aimed at” and “intended to influence or affect” the principal’s affairs. This is not a requirement of direct or immediate impact, but rather a demonstration of intent.

*   **Rejection of a “Direct Adverse Proprietary Consequence” Requirement:**  A critical point of contention was whether the prosecution needed to prove that the agent’s act or forbearance resulted in a direct, adverse proprietary consequence for the principal. The Court of Appeal rejected this requirement, arguing that it was overly restrictive and inconsistent with the broader purpose of the POBO.  They held that the focus should be on the *intent* of the agent, not the *outcome* for the principal.

*   **The Role of Reasonable Excuse:** The Court of Appeal affirmed the defense of reasonable excuse, as defined in section 24 of the POBO.  This defense applies when the agent acted without lawful authority but had a justifiable reason for doing so.  The defense bears the burden of proving the existence of a reasonable excuse.

*   **The Significance of *R v J (P)*:** The case of *R v J (P)* was pivotal in establishing the principle that an agent’s act or forbearance must be “in relation to his principal’s affairs or business” to constitute a violation of section 9.  The Court of Appeal relied on this precedent to support its interpretation of the phrase.

*   **The Distinction Between Public Servant and Agent:** The Court of Appeal distinguished between the provisions of the POBO relating to public servants and those relating to agents.  While the principles are similar, the focus shifts to the nature of the act performed by the public servant in relation to their official duties.

*   **The Importance of Intent:**  The Court of Appeal repeatedly stressed the importance of proving the agent’s *intent* to influence or affect the principal’s affairs.  This intent is the crucial element that distinguishes a corrupt transaction from a legitimate business arrangement.

*   **The Court’s Duty to Give Effect to Legislative Intent:**  The Court of Appeal acknowledged the need to give effect to the legislative intent behind the POBO, which is to prevent bribery and corruption. However, they argued that this intent should not be interpreted in a way that would unduly restrict the scope of the legislation.

*   **The Application of *Commissioner of the ICAC v Ch’ng Poh*:** The Court of Appeal’s decision was heavily influenced by the reasoning in *Commissioner of the ICAC v Ch’ng Poh*, which established the principle that the prosecution must prove that the advantage was offered with the intention of influencing or affecting the principal’s affairs.

**Novel or Controversial Points:**

*   **Shifting the Burden of Proof:** The Court of Appeal’s decision significantly shifted the burden of proof, requiring the prosecution to demonstrate not just that an act occurred in relation to the principal’s affairs, but also that the agent *intended* to influence or affect those affairs. This represents a more proactive approach to prosecuting bribery cases.

*   **Rejection of a “Proprietary Consequence” Requirement:** The rejection of the requirement that the agent’s act or forbearance result in a direct, adverse proprietary consequence for the principal was a notable departure from previous interpretations of the POBO.

*   **Emphasis on Intent over Outcome:** The Court of Appeal’s focus on the agent’s intent, rather than the outcome of the transaction, reflects a broader trend in criminal law towards focusing on the mental state of the offender.
