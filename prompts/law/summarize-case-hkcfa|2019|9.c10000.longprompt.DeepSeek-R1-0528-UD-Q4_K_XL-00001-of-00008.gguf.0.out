Hmm, the user has shared a Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal judgment and asked me to analyze it in four specific parts. This is a legal case about computer misuse under Section 161(1)(c) of Hong Kong's Crimes Ordinance. Let me break this down systematically.

First, for the facts: Four educators (three from one primary school plus a friend) used personal devices to share confidential interview questions. They photographed documents with smartphones and emailed/WhatsApped them to third parties. The key point is they used their own devices except one who used a school computer (treated as "her own" for this case). They were acquitted at trial.

For the arguments: The prosecution claimed any computer use for dishonest gain violates Section 161, even personal devices. The defense argued the law only covers unauthorized access to others' computers, not personal device usage. The prosecution warned narrow interpretation would create legal loopholes for cybercrimes.

Now the legal principles - this is the meaty part. The court's ratio decidendi hinges on statutory interpretation. The phrase "obtains access to a computer" implies accessing someone else's system, not using one's own device. The legislative history shows the law targeted preparatory acts like hacking into others' systems. The court rejected expanding it to personal device use, noting Parliament deliberately removed broad definitions during drafting. Crucially, they distinguished between preparatory offenses (Section 161's purpose) and substantive crimes committed via computers.

What's striking? The court prioritized legislative intent over modern cybercrime concerns. Despite acknowledging technological evolution since 1993, they refused to stretch the law's original scope. The "own computer" concession for the school device was also unusual - potentially setting a tricky precedent for employer-provided tech. And the fact all four judges simply endorsed Justice French's opinion shows remarkable consensus.

The user seems legally trained - perhaps a law student or practitioner analyzing Hong Kong's computer crime jurisprudence. They've structured the query precisely, suggesting they need this for academic or professional work. I'll maintain rigorous legal analysis while ensuring clarity.

Here's a comprehensive analysis of the case *Secretary for Justice v Cheng Ka Yee And 3 Others*:

### 1. Summary of Facts
- **Parties**: Four respondents—three teachers at Church of Christ in China Heep Woh Primary School and one teacher from another school.
- **Incident**: On June 13, 2014, during a briefing for competitive primary school admission interviews, the respondents obtained confidential interview questions and marking schemes.  
  - The 1st and 2nd respondents photographed documents with their **personal smartphones** (Xiaomi and Samsung) and sent images via WhatsApp to third parties.  
  - The 3rd respondent typed questions into a Word document on a **school desktop computer** and emailed it to others.  
  - The 4th respondent photographed questions with her **personal iPhone** and shared them via WhatsApp.  
- **Charges**: All four were charged under **s 161(1)(c) Crimes Ordinance** for "obtaining access to a computer with a view to dishonest gain for another."  
- **Outcome**: Acquitted at trial due to lack of proven dishonesty and confidentiality awareness. The prosecution appealed, leading to this CFA decision.  

### 2. Summary of Arguments  
- **Appellant (Secretary for Justice)**:  
  - Argued s 161(1)(c) criminalizes *any* computer use (including personal devices) for dishonest gain.  
  - Contended the actus reus is broad, covering actions like taking photos or transmitting data via smartphones.  
  - Warned a narrow interpretation would create loopholes for cybercrimes (e.g., phishing, hacking from personal devices).  

- **Respondents (Accused Teachers)**:  
  - Asserted s 161(1)(c) only applies to **unauthorized access to another person’s computer**.  
  - Using one’s own device (or an employer’s device with implied authorization) cannot constitute "obtaining access."  
  - Emphasized legislative history shows the law targets hacking, not personal device misuse.  

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The Court of Final Appeal established the following key principles:  

#### (a) **Core Interpretation of s 161(1)(c)**  
- The phrase "**obtains access to a computer**" implies accessing a computer *other than one’s own*.  
- **Ordinary Meaning**: "Obtain" denotes gaining possession or entry to something previously inaccessible (e.g., another’s system). Using one’s own device does not involve "obtaining access."  
- **Statutory Context**:  
  - s 161 was enacted alongside offenses targeting *unauthorized access* (e.g., s 27A Telecommunications Ordinance).  
  - Unlike other provisions, s 161 lacks "unauthorized" but retains the conceptual link to *external* systems.  

#### (b) **Legislative Intent and History**  
- **Purpose**: Created to criminalize *preparatory acts* for fraud/theft (e.g., hacking into bank records) where no other offense existed.  
- **Legislative Materials**:  
  - The 1993 Computer Crimes Ordinance aimed to penalize "gaining access to computers" belonging to others.  
  - A proposed clause defining "access" as "causing a computer to perform any function" was **deliberately removed** to avoid overbreadth.  
- **Policy Limitation**: The offense targets intrusion into third-party systems, not misuse of personal devices.  

#### (c) **Exclusion of Personal Computers**  
- **Ownership/Control Matters**: Using one’s own device (e.g., smartphone) falls outside s 161(1)(c).  
- **Employer Devices**: Where an employee has **general authorization** to use a work computer (as conceded for the 3rd respondent), such use is not "obtaining access."  
- **No "Dishonest Access" via Personal Use**: Transmitting data *from* one’s own device (e.g., emailing files) does not constitute the actus reus.  

#### (d) **Rejection of Prosecution’s Broad Interpretation**  
- **Public Policy Concerns**: The Court declined to expand s 161 to cover personal devices despite technological advancements (e.g., online fraud), stating:  
  > *"The Court seeks to ascertain the purpose of the statute... It does not identify a purpose which it thinks would be beneficial and then construe the statute to fit it."*  
- **Alternative Offenses**: Misuse of personal devices for crimes (e.g., fraud, harassment) may violate other laws but not s 161(1(c)).  

### 4. Striking/Unusual Aspects  
1. **Technological Anachronism**:  
   - The 1993 law failed to anticipate personal devices (e.g., smartphones) as tools for crime. The Court acknowledged this gap but refused to "update" the statute judicially, highlighting legislative inertia in the digital age.  

2. **Judicial Consensus**:  
   - All four CFA judges (including the Chief Justice) **unanimously endorsed** Justice French’s opinion without separate commentary—unusual for a landmark interpretation.  

3. **Prosecution’s Concession**:  
   - The Secretary for Justice treated the school computer (used by the 3rd respondent) as the teacher’s "own" device despite ownership issues. This tactical concession weakened the broader applicability argument.  

4. **Real-World Impact**:  
   - The ruling exposed a **significant loophole**: Crimes committed *via* personal devices (e.g., revenge porn, phishing) may evade s 161(1)(c), forcing reliance on narrower
