### 1. Summary of Facts

The case involves Stephen Chan Chi Wan ("Chan"), a General Manager (Broadcasting) at Television Broadcasts Ltd ("TVB"), and Tseng Pei Kun ("Tseng"), the director of an advertising agency (IEAP) that acted as Chan's agent for outside engagements. Chan hosted a popular TVB talk show called "Be My Guest" (or "Chi Wan's Dinner Party"). In late 2009, Olympian City (OC), a shopping mall operator, planned a New Year's Eve Countdown show produced by TVB. OC wished to include a live segment of "Be My Guest" as an ancillary part of the event.

OC knew that TVB would not provide its "top-tier artistes" for this specific segment and independently contacted Tseng to arrange for Chan to appear. OC agreed to pay IEAP $160,000; IEAP paid Chan $112,000 and the other guest $20,000, keeping $28,000. Chan did not seek or obtain permission from TVB to accept this payment, despite his employment contract requiring approval for outside work. However, it was generally known at TVB that Chan would be participating in the Countdown event, and the segment was produced and broadcast by TVB.

Chan and Tseng were charged with conspiring to commit, and alternatively committing, offences under section 9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO). The prosecution alleged that Chan, as an agent of TVB, accepted an advantage ($112,000) as a reward for doing an act in relation to his principal's affairs (appearing in the show), and that Tseng offered this advantage. The trial judge initially acquitted them, finding the act was not "in relation to TVB's affairs" and that Chan had a reasonable excuse. The Court of Appeal reversed this, convicting them. The appellants appealed to the Court of Final Appeal (CFA).

### 2. Summary of Arguments

**The Prosecution (Secretary for Justice):**
*   **Actus Reus:** Chan's appearance in the "Be My Guest" segment was an act "in relation to TVB's affairs or business" because the show was produced and broadcast by TVB, and his participation was crucial to the success of the Countdown event (boosting ratings and fulfilling OC's contract).
*   **Mens Rea:** Chan knew the payment was an inducement for his appearance in the show, which was part of TVB's broadcast.
*   **No Prejudice Required:** The offence does not require proof that the principal suffered actual prejudice or that the act was detrimental to the principal. The mere fact that the act related to the principal's business is sufficient.
*   **Reasonable Excuse:** Chan had no reasonable excuse because he failed to obtain the required permission from TVB, and the payment was a secret commission.

**The Appellants (Chan and Tseng):**
*   **Actus Reus:** Chan's appearance was a "moonlighting" act performed in his capacity as a celebrity/artist, not as an agent of TVB. The act was not "aimed at" TVB's affairs; rather, it was an act for OC's benefit. The fact that TVB benefited (ratings) does not make the act "in relation to" TVB's business in the legal sense required by section 9.
*   **Mens Rea:** Chan did not intend his act to influence or affect TVB's affairs; he was simply fulfilling a contract with OC.
*   **Prejudice Required:** The offence under section 9 is designed to protect the integrity of the agency relationship. Therefore, the act must be one that undermines that relationship or is adverse to the principal's interests. Since Chan's act was beneficial to TVB (no conflict of interest, no secret profit at TVB's expense), it fell outside the scope of the offence.
*   **Reasonable Excuse:** Even if the act was related to TVB's business, Chan had a reasonable excuse because TVB was aware of his participation and the arrangement was open, not secret.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) unanimously allowed the appeals and quashed the convictions. The judgment, primarily delivered by Ribeiro PJ (with concurring judgments by Tang PJ and Fok PJ), established several critical legal principles regarding the interpretation of section 9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO).

**The Restrictive Nature of "In Relation to His Principal's Affairs or Business"**
The most significant legal principle established is that the phrase "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" in section 9 is a **restrictive** element, not a broad one. Relying heavily on the Privy Council decision in *Commissioner of the ICAC v Ch'ng Poh*, the CFA held that for an offence to be committed, the agent's act or forbearance must be **aimed at** the principal and **intended to influence or affect** the principal's affairs.
Crucially, the CFA clarified that this influence or effect must be **adverse** to the principal's interests. The offence is designed to protect the integrity of the agency relationship, specifically the bond of trust and loyalty. Therefore, conduct that is beneficial to the principal, or at least neutral, and does not undermine the agency relationship, does not fall within the scope of section 9. In this case, Chan's appearance was beneficial to TVB (boosting ratings) and did not involve any conflict of interest or secret profit at TVB's expense. Consequently, the act was not "in relation to" TVB's affairs in the criminal sense required by the statute.

**The Requirement of Adverse Conduct (The "Mischief" of the Ordinance)**
Ribeiro PJ emphasized that the "mischief" targeted by section 9 is the corruption of the agency relationship. The legislative intent is to prevent agents from being tempted to act against their principal's interests. The Court rejected the Court of Appeal's view that any act "related to" the principal's business suffices, regardless of whether it causes prejudice.
The CFA held that for the offence to be made out, the induced or rewarded conduct must be of a nature that **undermines the integrity of the agency relationship**. This includes acts that injure the relationship of trust and loyalty, such as accepting a bribe to reveal confidential information or to favor a third party to the detriment of the principal. If the act is beneficial to the principal (as in this case, where the principal's business was enhanced without cost), it cannot be said to have undermined the integrity of the relationship. Thus, the absence of prejudice or detriment to the principal is a fundamental element in determining whether the act falls within the ambit of section 9.

**Mens Rea and the "Aimed At" Requirement**
The CFA clarified the *mens rea* (mental element) required for section 9 offences.
*   **For the Agent (Accepting/Soliciting):** The prosecution must prove that the agent **knew or believed** that the advantage was provided as an inducement or reward for an act that was **aimed at** and **intended to influence or affect** the principal's affairs in a manner that undermines the agency relationship.
*   **For the Offeror:** The prosecution must prove that the offeror **intended** that the advantage would be accepted as an inducement for an act aimed at the principal's affairs.
In this case, neither Chan nor Tseng had the requisite intent to influence TVB's affairs adversely. Chan was acting for OC, and Tseng was acting for OC; neither intended to harm or influence TVB's business in a corrupt manner.

**Conspiracy and the Burden of Proof**
The CFA also addressed the issue of conspiracy. The Court of Appeal had directed the trial judge to convict on the charge of conspiracy. The CFA held that the reverse onus provision in section 24 of POBO (which places the burden of proving "reasonable excuse" on the accused) does **not** apply to the common law offence of conspiracy (or the statutory conspiracy under the Crimes Ordinance).
The prosecution bears the burden of proving all elements of the conspiracy, including that the agreed course of conduct would necessarily result in the commission of the substantive offence *without* any lawful authority or reasonable excuse. Since the substantive offence (section 9) was not made out (because the act was not adverse to the principal), the conspiracy charge could not stand. The prosecution could not rely on section 24 to shift the burden of proving the absence of reasonable excuse in a conspiracy charge.

**Reasonable Excuse (Concurring View)**
While Ribeiro PJ found that the substantive offence was not made out, Tang PJ (concurring) offered an alternative view. He agreed that the appeals should be allowed but argued that Chan's act *was* related to TVB's business, but he had a **reasonable excuse** to accept the payment. Tang PJ reasoned that TVB was aware of the arrangement and the payment, and Chan honestly believed he had the principal's consent. He emphasized that the removal of the word "corruptly" from the statute did not mean that *any* secret payment is criminal; the defence of reasonable excuse is wide enough to cover situations where the agent believes the principal would not object, even if formal permission was not obtained.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

**The "Beneficial Bribery" Paradox:**
The most striking aspect of this case is the legal conclusion that accepting a large sum of money ($112,000) for a public performance, where the employer (TVB) actually **benefited** from the act (increased ratings, no cost to them), does not constitute a crime under the anti-bribery laws. The court effectively ruled that "corruption" requires a detriment to the principal. If the agent's "corrupt" act is actually good for the boss, it is not a crime. This creates a clear boundary between "secret commissions" (which are civilly actionable and often criminal) and "moonlighting" that happens to align with the employer's interests.

**The Distinction Between "Related To" and "Aimed At":**
The case highlights a subtle but crucial linguistic distinction in statutory interpretation. The Court of Appeal had adopted a very broad view: if the act is "related to" the principal's business (e.g., the show was on TVB), it is an offence. The CFA rejected this, insisting on a narrower, purposive interpretation: the act must be "aimed at" the principal's affairs in a way that threatens the agency relationship. This prevents the anti-bribery laws from becoming a tool to criminalize any side-employment that happens to touch upon the employer's industry.

**The "Reasonable Excuse" Defense in a High-Profile Case:**
The case is remarkable for the detailed discussion of "reasonable excuse" in the context of a celebrity. The court acknowledged that in the entertainment industry, where public figures often have multiple revenue streams, the line between "moonlighting" and "bribery" can be thin. The judgment suggests that if the employer is aware of the arrangement and the act is beneficial, the "reasonable excuse" defense is robust, even if the agent technically breached a contractual clause requiring prior written permission.

**The "Secret Commission" vs. "Open Arrangement":**
The case underscores that the "secret" nature of the payment is a key factor in determining criminality. While the prosecution argued that the lack of formal permission made it a crime, the CFA (and Tang PJ) noted that the arrangement was "open" and known to the employer. The "mischief" of bribery is the secret betrayal of trust. If the trust is not betrayed (because the employer knows and benefits), the "mischief" is not present, and thus the crime is not committed. This reinforces the idea that anti-corruption laws are about protecting the integrity of the relationship, not just punishing the receipt of money. [end of text]
