### 1. **Brief Summary of the Facts**

The case involves four teachers—three from the Church of Christ in China Heep Woh Primary School and one from another school—who were charged under **Section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200)** for obtaining access to a computer with a view to dishonest gain for another. The charges arose from their actions on **13 June 2014**, when they attended a briefing session for an upcoming competitive admission interview process for their school. During the session, each teacher was given a plastic folder containing confidential interview questions and a marking scheme.

The first, second, and fourth respondents used their **personal smartphones** to take photographs of the questions and transmitted them via **WhatsApp** to friends or colleagues. The third respondent used a **school-provided desktop computer** to type up the questions into a Word document, which was then emailed to others. All transmissions were made with the intent to provide the questions to third parties, likely to help students prepare for the interviews—thereby giving them an unfair advantage.

The prosecution argued that these acts constituted the offence under s 161(1)(c), which criminalizes obtaining access to a computer with a view to dishonest gain. However, the **Permanent Magistrate acquitted all four respondents**, primarily due to **reasonable doubt about the element of dishonesty** and whether the teachers knew the questions were confidential.

The **Secretary for Justice appealed**, arguing that the acquittal was legally flawed. The appeal was heard by the Court of First Instance, where Deputy Judge Pang ruled that the **actus reus** (the physical element of the crime) under s 161(1)(c) did **not apply** when a person used **their own computer** to access or transmit information, even if the intent was dishonest. He emphasized that the offence required **unauthorized extraction and use of information from a computer**, not merely the use of one’s own device.

The appeal was then taken to the **Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal (CFA)**, which ultimately **dismissed the appeal**, holding that s 161(1)(c) does not apply to the use of one’s own computer unless it involves unauthorized access to another computer.

### 2. **Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties**

#### **Appellant (Secretary for Justice):**
- Argued that **Section 161(1)(c)** should be interpreted **broadly** to cover any use of a computer with a dishonest intent to gain, regardless of whether the computer belonged to the person or someone else.
- Emphasized that **modern technology** has evolved significantly since the 1993 enactment of the Computer Crimes Ordinance, and that the law must keep pace with new forms of digital misconduct.
- Cited examples such as:
  - Using a private email to forward company data,
  - Taking secret photos with a smartphone,
  - Sending false emails,
  - Applying for credit cards fraudulently online,
  - Phishing and identity theft.
- Contended that these acts, though not involving “hacking” or “unauthorized access” in the traditional sense, still involve **misuse of a computer** and fall within the **natural meaning** of “obtaining access to a computer”.
- Argued that a narrow interpretation would create a **legal loophole**, allowing serious computer-related misconduct to go unpunished, undermining public policy and the deterrent effect of the law.
- Noted that the **legislative intent** was to criminalize **any dishonest use of computers**, not just access to others’ systems.

#### **Respondents (Teachers):**
- Argued that **using one’s own computer** cannot constitute “obtaining access” to a computer under s 161(1)(c), because the person already has **lawful and rightful access** to their own device.
- Emphasized the **ordinary meaning of the words** “obtain access” — which implies gaining entry to something previously inaccessible, not using something one already owns and controls.
- Pointed out that the **statutory language** is redundant if it applies to one’s own device: “obtain access” and “access” are synonymous, so the phrase would be meaningless if it covered self-use.
- Highlighted that **no other provision** in the Computer Crimes Ordinance 1993 applies to self-use of a computer, suggesting a legislative intent to exclude such cases.
- Argued that the **purpose** of s 161 was to target **preparatory acts** for fraud or theft involving **another person’s computer**, not private conduct.
- Noted that the **legislative history** (e.g., the Working Group’s recommendation) referred to “gaining access” to a computer, implying access to someone else’s system.
- Maintained that the **public policy argument** should not override the **textual and purposive construction** of the law.

### 3. **Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) – Detailed and Thorough Analysis**

The **ratio decidendi** of *Secretary for Justice v Cheng Ka Yee* is that **Section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200) does not apply to the use of a person’s own computer**, even if the use is dishonest and results in gain for another, **unless the use involves unauthorized access to another computer**.

This conclusion rests on a **careful, multi-layered analysis** of **text, context, purpose, and legislative history**, which together form a coherent and compelling interpretation of the statute.
