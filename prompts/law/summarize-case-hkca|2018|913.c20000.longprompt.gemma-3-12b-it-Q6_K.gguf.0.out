## 1. Summary of Facts

*HKSAR v. So Ping Chi* concerns a former General Manager and Principal Surveyor of Ships at the Marine Department who was convicted of misconduct in public office. Between 2007 and 2013, he issued an instruction to his subordinates (the "non-enforcement instruction") that new regulations requiring children's lifejackets on local vessels only applied to vessels licensed *after* January 2, 2007, and not to those already licensed. This instruction was issued in response to concerns from industry representatives about the financial burden of complying with the new regulations. The instruction remained in effect until after a tragic ferry collision near Lamma Island in 2012, prompting an inquiry that revealed the non-enforcement instruction. The appellant failed to rescind the instruction during his tenure. He admitted to issuing the instruction but argued he did so to ease the industry's financial burden and ensure a smooth implementation of the new regulations.



## 2. Summary of Arguments

**Appellant (So Ping Chi):**

*   **Lack of Wilfulness & Seriousness:** The appellant argued that the judge failed to adequately consider his state of mind when issuing the instruction. He contended that he didn't subjectively appreciate the seriousness of the consequences and that the judge treated the mere act of issuing the instruction as proof of wilfulness.
*   **Absence of Dishonest Motive:** The appellant’s counsel argued that the offence of misconduct in public office requires a dishonest, corrupt, or malicious motive, which was absent in this case.  He asserted that the appellant’s actions were driven by a desire to facilitate the smooth implementation of the new regulations, not by any improper intent.
*   **Reasonable Excuse/Justification:** The appellant claimed he had a reasonable excuse for continuing the non-enforcement instruction – the need to ensure a smooth implementation and avoid financial hardship for the industry. He also suggested that the new regulations didn't significantly improve safety, as existing lifejackets were suitable for both adults and children.
*   **Disproportionate Sentence:** The appellant argued that the 16-month sentence was excessive, given his exemplary character, lack of personal gain, and the fact that his predecessors and successors were not prosecuted for similar actions.

**Respondent (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region):**

*   **Sufficient Evidence of Wilfulness & Seriousness:** The respondent argued that the judge correctly found the appellant’s actions to be wilful and serious, as he deliberately disregarded the law and undermined public safety. The prosecution did not need to prove a dishonest motive to establish seriousness.
*   **No Requirement for Dishonest Motive:** The respondent relied on the Court of Final Appeal’s decision in *Shum Kwok Sher v HKSAR*, arguing that in cases of nonfeasance (failure to perform a duty), wilfulness alone, coupled with the absence of a reasonable excuse, is sufficient to establish culpability.
*   **No Reasonable Excuse:** The respondent contended that the appellant’s desire to appease the industry and ensure a smooth implementation did not constitute a reasonable excuse for defying the law. He had no authority to exempt vessels from compliance and failed to seek legal advice.
*   **Appropriate Sentence:** The respondent maintained that the 16-month sentence was appropriate, given the seriousness of the misconduct, the length of time the non-enforcement instruction was in effect, and the potential consequences for public safety.



## 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The Court of Appeal’s judgment in *HKSAR v. So Ping Chi* clarifies and elaborates on several key legal principles relating to the offence of misconduct in public office, particularly concerning the elements of wilfulness, seriousness, and the necessity of a dishonest motive. The case is notable for its nuanced discussion of the distinction between misfeasance and nonfeasance, and the implications for proving culpability.

**1. Distinction Between Misfeasance and Nonfeasance in the Context of Misconduct in Public Office:**

The court emphasized the crucial distinction between misfeasance (acting unlawfully while exercising a lawful power) and nonfeasance (failure to perform a duty).  Drawing heavily from *Shum Kwok Sher v HKSAR*, the court explained that in cases of *misfeasance*, demonstrating an *improper motive* (dishonest, corrupt, or malicious) is generally required to establish that the conduct constitutes culpable misconduct. This is because the public officer is already exercising a lawful power; the misconduct lies in *how* that power is exercised. However, in cases of *nonfeasance*, where the public officer fails to perform a duty, the mere demonstration of *wilful intent* (voluntary and deliberate failure to act), coupled with the absence of a reasonable excuse or justification, can be sufficient to establish culpability. The court found this case to be one of nonfeasance, as the appellant deliberately failed to enforce the law.

**2. The Element of "Wilfulness" – Deliberate and Voluntary:**

The court reiterated that "wilfulness" in the context of misconduct in public office requires more than mere negligence. It signifies a *deliberate* and *voluntary* act or omission. The court found that the evidence supported the judge’s conclusion that the appellant’s issuance and subsequent failure to rescind the non-enforcement instruction were deliberate, not inadvertent. The absence of any explanation for his inaction further reinforced this finding.

**3. The Element of "Seriousness" – Erosion of Public Trust and Departure from Responsibilities:**

The court affirmed that the seriousness of the misconduct is assessed by considering the responsibilities of the office, the importance of the public objects served, and the nature and extent of the departure from those responsibilities. The court agreed with the judge’s finding that the appellant’s actions were serious because they represented a significant departure from his duty to enforce the law, effectively substituting his own judgment for that of the legislature. The court highlighted that the instruction’s blanket application to a large number of vessels and its prolonged duration (over three years) further underscored its seriousness. The court emphasized that the appellant’s actions undermined public trust in the Marine Department and the civil service as a whole.

**4. The Absence of a Dishonest Motive is Not Determinative of Seriousness (in Nonfeasance Cases):**

The court decisively rejected the appellant’s argument that the absence of a dishonest, corrupt, or malicious motive precluded a finding of serious misconduct. Relying on *Shum Kwok Sher*, the court held that in cases of nonfeasance, the focus should be on the wilfulness of the failure to perform the duty and the absence of a reasonable excuse, rather than on the presence of an improper motive. While a dishonest motive might elevate the seriousness of the misconduct, its absence does not automatically negate the possibility of a finding of culpability.

**5. The Role of Subjective Appreciation of Consequences:**

While acknowledging the appellant’s argument that the judge should have considered his subjective appreciation of the consequences of his actions, the court ultimately upheld the judge’s decision. The court reasoned that, given the appellant’s failure to provide any evidence regarding his subjective beliefs, it was appropriate for the judge to assess the seriousness of the misconduct based on the objective facts and circumstances. The court emphasized that the appellant, as a senior official, should have been aware of the potential consequences of his actions and the importance of upholding the law.

**6. The Importance of Seeking Legal Advice and Consulting Superiors:**

The court implicitly underscored the importance of public officials seeking legal advice and consulting their superiors before deviating from established legal procedures. The appellant’s failure to do so further demonstrated the seriousness of his misconduct and undermined his claim of a reasonable excuse.

**Novel/Controversial Points:**

*   **Clarification of *Shum Kwok Sher*:** The case provides a more detailed and practical application of the *Shum Kwok Sher* principles, particularly in distinguishing between misfeasance and nonfeasance and outlining the evidentiary requirements for each.
*   **Emphasis on Public Trust:** The court’s strong emphasis on the erosion of public trust as a key factor in determining the seriousness of the misconduct reinforces the importance of maintaining the integrity of public office.
*   **Disproportionate Punishment:** The court’s decision to reduce the sentence to time served, citing the lack of prosecution of the appellant’s predecessors and successors, raises a point of fairness and consistency in the application of the law. This aspect of the judgment could be seen as controversial, as it suggests that the appellant was unfairly targeted while others involved in the same policy were not held accountable.



In conclusion, *HKSAR v. So Ping Chi* provides valuable guidance on the elements of misconduct in public office, particularly in cases involving nonfeasance. It clarifies the role of wilfulness, seriousness, and the absence of a dishonest motive, and underscores the importance of upholding the rule of law and maintaining public trust in the civil service.
