Hmm, I need to analyze this Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal case about transgender marriage rights. The user wants a structured breakdown with four specific tasks: facts summary, parties' arguments, legal principles, and remarkable aspects.

First, the facts: The appellant W is a post-operative male-to-female transsexual who wants to marry her male partner. The Registrar of Marriages refused, stating marriage requires one biological man and one biological woman. W underwent full sex reassignment surgery in Hong Kong hospitals, has female documentation (ID/passport), but birth certificate remains unchanged. She challenged this through judicial review but lost in lower courts.

For arguments: W's side (Lord Pannick QC) argues trans women should be legally recognized as women for marriage under constitutional rights (Basic Law Art 37, Bill of Rights Art 19(2)). The Registrar (Monica Carss-Frisk QC) insists marriage is traditionally biological, citing Corbett v Corbett, and warns of legal chaos without legislative intervention.

The legal principles are complex. The majority (Ma CJ, Ribeiro PJ, Bokhary NPJ) found the statutes unconstitutional as applied, using remedial interpretation to include post-op transsexuals. They rejected Corbett's biological-only criteria, emphasizing psychological/social factors and evolving marriage norms. Chan PJ dissented, prioritizing legislative over judicial action. Key ratios include: constitutional rights as living instruments, rejection of procreation as marriage's essence, and recognition that denying marriage impairs rights.

What's remarkable? The 4-1 split shows deep judicial tension. The court suspended relief for 12 months - rare deference to legislature. Hong Kong's position contrasts with its own gender recognition practices (IDs/passports). The judgment cites tragic suicides (Louise Chan, Sasha Moon), humanizing the legal debate. Also notable is how the court handled international trends while focusing on local context.

The user seems legally knowledgeable - perhaps a law student or professional researching gender rights. They'd appreciate the constitutional balancing act: affirming rights while inviting legislative refinement. The case's human impact (W's 8-year ordeal) might resonate beyond pure legal analysis.

### Case Summary: *W v. The Registrar of Marriages* [2013] HKCFA 39  

#### 1. **Brief Summary of Facts**  
- The appellant, "W," is a Hong Kong permanent resident and post-operative male-to-female transsexual. After extensive medical treatment (hormonal therapy, psychiatric assessment, and sex reassignment surgery (SRS)), she lives fully as a woman, holds a female identity card and passport, and is certified female by the Hospital Authority.  
- W sought to marry her male partner but was refused by the Registrar of Marriages. The Registrar argued that under the Marriage Ordinance (Cap 181) and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance (Cap 179), marriage is defined as a union between "one man and one woman," determined solely by biological sex at birth.  
- W challenged this decision via judicial review, losing in both the Court of First Instance and the Court of Appeal before appealing to the Court of Final Appeal (CFA).  

#### 2. **Summary of Arguments**  
- **Appellant (W)**:  
  - Argued that post-SRS transsexuals should be legally recognized as their acquired gender for marriage.  
  - Contended that excluding her violated:  
    - **Article 37 of the Basic Law** (freedom of marriage).  
    - **Article 19(2) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights** (right to marry and found a family).  
    - **Article 14 of the Bill of Rights** (right to privacy).  
  - Emphasized medical consensus: Transsexualism is a recognized condition, and SRS aligns legal identity with lived reality.  
  - Cited international trends (e.g., *Goodwin v UK*) where transsexuals’ marriage rights are upheld.  

- **Respondent (Registrar of Marriages)**:  
  - Insisted "man" and "woman" in the Ordinances mean biological sex fixed at birth (*Corbett v Corbett* [1971]).  
  - Argued procreation remains a core element of marriage, and SRS cannot alter chromosomal sex (XY for W).  
  - Claimed no social consensus in Hong Kong supports redefining marriage.  
  - Warned of far-reaching legal ramifications (e.g., inheritance, parental rights) best addressed legislatively, not judicially.  

#### 3. **Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**  
The CFA’s majority (4:1) allowed W’s appeal, establishing several key principles:  

- **Statutory Construction**:  
  - The Ordinances (*Corbett*-based) were correctly interpreted by the Registrar as limiting "man/woman" to biological sex at birth. However, this interpretation was unconstitutional.  

- **Constitutional Right to Marriage (Articles 37 and 19(2))**:  
  - **Living Instrument Doctrine**: The Basic Law and Bill of Rights must evolve with societal changes. The traditional view of marriage (focused on procreation) is outdated. Procreation is not essential to marriage (e.g., infertile couples may marry).  
  - **Rejection of *Corbett* Criteria**: Purely biological (chromosomal/gonadal/genital) criteria are inadequate. Legal sex must account for **psychological, social, and post-SRS factors** (e.g., gender identity, lived experience, medical certification).  
  - **Essence of the Right Impairment**: Denying W marriage in her acquired gender nullified her right entirely, as she could not feasibly marry as a man post-SRS. This violated the core of Articles 37 and 19(2).  

- **Remedial Interpretation**:  
  - Courts must reinterpret unconstitutional statutes to align with constitutional rights. "Woman" in the Ordinances includes post-SRS transsexuals certified by medical authorities.  
  - The legislature was urged (but not mandated) to create a gender-recognition framework (e.g., akin to the UK’s Gender Recognition Act 2004).  

- **Margin of Appreciation & Consensus**:  
  - Lack of local social consensus cannot override minority rights. Constitutional protections exist precisely for marginalized groups.  
  - International trends (42+ jurisdictions recognizing trans marriages) reinforced the decision but were secondary to Hong Kong’s constitutional obligations.  

#### 4. **Striking/Unusual Aspects**  
1. **Judicial Courage vs. Legislative Deference**:  
   - The CFA overruled long-standing precedent (*Corbett*) despite acknowledging the complexity of ramifications (e.g., family law, records). It suspended the ruling for **12 months** to allow legislative action—a rare balance between judicial boldness and respect for the legislature.  

2. **Human Tragedy as Context**:  
   - The judgment highlighted suicides of trans individuals (Louise Chan, Sasha Moon) due to social stigma, grounding legal analysis in real-world suffering.  

3. **Contrast with Government Practice**:  
   - Hong Kong’s government issued W a female ID/passport but denied marriage rights—exposing incoherence in recognizing gender identity across domains.  

4. **Dissenting Opinion (Chan PJ)**:  
   - Argued no local consensus justified redefining marriage and warned against judicial overreach. This highlighted tensions between constitutional evolution and democratic process.  

5. **Global Influence**:  
   - The CFA cited cases from the UK, Australia, and the ECtHR (*Goodwin*), positioning Hong Kong within a global shift toward trans rights while emphasizing local constitutional autonomy.  

**Conclusion**: The case is a landmark in transgender rights, affirming that constitutional guarantees of dignity and equality require legal systems to adapt to medical and social realities. Its blend of progressive jurisprudence and pragmatic suspension of relief reflects the unique role of courts in societal change. [end of text]
