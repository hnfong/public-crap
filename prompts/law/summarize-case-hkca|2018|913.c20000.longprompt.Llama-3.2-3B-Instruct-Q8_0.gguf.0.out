**Facts of the Case**

The case involves a public servant, SO PING CHI, who was convicted of misconduct in public office for issuing an instruction to his subordinates not to enforce the provisions of the Merchant Shipping (Local Vessels) (Safety and Survey) Regulation, Cap 548G, which required the provision of children's lifejackets on board vessels licensed before January 2, 2007. The instruction was issued in April 2007, and it remained in effect until it was rescinded by one of his successors in August 2010. The instruction was found to be a serious breach of duty, as it directly contravened the legislative requirement and had significant consequences for public safety.

The case involves a complex set of facts, including the background to the regulation, the role of the Marine Department, and the actions of the appellant, who was the General Manager and Principal Surveyor of Ships of the Local Vessel Safety Branch. The regulation was enacted in January 2007, and it required vessels to increase the number of lifejackets on board, including children's lifejackets, to ensure safety at sea. The appellant's predecessor had issued a policy allowing old vessels to follow the old law, but the appellant continued this policy, despite being aware of the new regulation.

The prosecution alleged that the appellant's actions were wilful and serious misconduct, and that he had deliberately decided not to enforce the law. The judge found that the appellant had issued the instruction, which was a deliberate and not inadvertent act, and that he had failed to rescind it despite having the authority and opportunity to do so. The judge also found that the appellant's actions had serious consequences for public safety and that he had eroded the public's trust in the Marine Department.

**Arguments of the Parties**

The appellant, represented by Daniel Marash SC and Maggie Wong SC, argued that the judge had erred in finding that the appellant's actions were wilful and serious misconduct. The appellant claimed that there was no evidence to support the finding of wilfulness, and that the judge had failed to consider the appellant's subjective view of the consequences of his actions. The appellant also argued that the judge had failed to consider the reasonable excuse or justification for the appellant's actions, including the need to ensure the "smooth implementation" of the new regulation.

The respondent, represented by Andrew Bruce SC and Denise Souza, argued that the judge had properly assessed the element of "wilful misconduct" and "seriousness" and had not required to take into account the consequences on passengers' safety or the appellant's subjective view of such consequences. The respondent submitted that the judge had correctly applied the test of "wilfulness" as being deliberate and not inadvertent, and that the appellant's actions were serious enough to warrant conviction.

**Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The case turns on several key legal principles, including the definition of misconduct in public office, the test for wilfulness, and the test for seriousness. The court's decision establishes that misconduct in public office requires a serious breach of duty, which must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. The court also established that the test for wilfulness requires a deliberate and not inadvertent act, and that the seriousness of the misconduct must be proven beyond reasonable doubt.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of considering the consequences of the misconduct and the impact on public safety. The court found that the appellant's actions had serious consequences for public safety and that he had eroded the public's trust in the Marine Department. The court also emphasized the need for public servants to act with integrity and to uphold the law, even in the face of opposition from industry representatives.

The case also raises questions about the role of the Director of Marine and the appellant's authority to exempt vessels from compliance with the regulation. The court's decision suggests that the Director of Marine has the power to exempt vessels from compliance with the regulation, but that the appellant did not have the authority to do so.

The case also highlights the importance of considering the subjective view of the consequences of the misconduct. The court found that the appellant had not provided any explanation for his actions, and that his subjective view of the consequences was not relevant to the determination of the case. However, the court also emphasized the importance of considering the appellant's subjective view in determining the severity of the sentence.

Overall, the case establishes that misconduct in public office requires a serious breach of duty, a deliberate and not inadvertent act, and a significant impact on public safety. The court's decision also highlights the importance of considering the consequences of the misconduct and the impact on public safety, as well as the need for public servants to act with integrity and uphold the law.
