## KWOK CHEUK KIN AND ANOTHER v. DIRECTOR OF LANDS AND OTHERS [2021] HKCA 54; CACV 317/2019 – Case Summary

### 1. Facts of the Case

This case concerns the constitutionality of the New Territories Small House Policy (“Small House Policy”), which allows male indigenous villagers of the New Territories (“NTIIs”) to apply for permission to build a small house on suitable land once in their lifetime. The policy has evolved since its inception in 1972, offering grants through free building licenses, private treaty grants (on government land), and land exchange.  The applicants challenged the policy, arguing it was discriminatory based on social origin/birth and sex, violating articles 25 and 39 of the Basic Law (“BL”) and article 22 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights (“BOR”). The respondents (the government) and an interested party (representing NTII interests) defended the policy, arguing it fell within the protection of Article 40 of the Basic Law, which protects the “lawful traditional rights and interests” of NTIIs. The lower court found the policy discriminatory but upheld its constitutionality to the extent it provided free building licenses, finding those rights traceable to pre-1898 traditions.  The case came before the Court of Appeal to determine whether the entire Small House Policy, or only the free building license aspect, was protected by BL40.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**Applicants:** Argued that the entire Small House Policy was unconstitutional. They contended that BL40 only protects rights that are *already* lawful and do not violate fundamental rights like equality. They further argued that the “Ding Rights” (the right to apply for a small house) were not true “rights” but merely a discretionary government policy.  Even if they were rights, they weren’t “traditional” as they weren’t traceable to pre-1898 practices beyond the free building license aspect. They also argued that the discriminatory nature of the policy should disqualify it from protection under BL40.

**Respondents & Interested Party:**  Maintained that the entire Small House Policy was protected by BL40. They argued that “lawful” and “traditional” were distinct concepts, and the policy represented a continuation of historical practices and recognition of NTIIs’ unique status. They emphasized the historical context of the New Territories Lease in 1898 and the subsequent recognition of village customs by the colonial administration. They argued that the policy addressed legitimate concerns about housing and squatter problems.  The interested party specifically argued that “lawful traditional rights” referred to rights existing *before* the Basic Law came into force, and that the term “lawful” was descriptive rather than requiring current legality. They also pointed to the Joint Declaration and subsequent legislation as evidence of an intention to preserve the policy.



### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

This case establishes a detailed and nuanced interpretation of Article 40 of the Basic Law, concerning the protection of “lawful traditional rights and interests” of New Territories indigenous inhabitants. The Court of Appeal overturned aspects of the lower court’s judgment, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding the scope of this constitutional protection.  The core principles established are:

**1. Contextual and Purposive Interpretation of BL40:** The court reaffirmed the need for a contextual and purposive approach to interpreting the Basic Law, considering its historical background and the circumstances surrounding its drafting. This necessitates understanding the unique historical context of the New Territories and the status of its indigenous inhabitants.

**2. Historical Foundation of NTII Rights:** The court emphasized that the concept of NTIIs originated with the 1898 New Territories Lease.  The assurances given by the colonial administration regarding the customs and usages of the inhabitants at that time are crucial to understanding the foundation of their rights.

**3.  “Traditional” Rights – Not a Tracing Exercise, but Existence at 1990:**  Critically, the court rejected the lower court’s “tracing exercise” requiring a direct link to pre-1898 practices. Instead, the court held that a right is “traditional” if it was recognized as such *at the time the Basic Law was drafted in 1990*, regardless of its precise origins before 1898.  The focus is on whether the right was understood as a customary practice or recognized right in the New Territories leading up to the Basic Law’s enactment.  Evolution of the right over time is permissible, as long as the essential features remain.

**4. “Lawful” Rights – Recognition in the Legal System:** The court clarified that “lawful” in BL40 does not require current legality under all modern legal standards. Rather, it means the rights were recognized as lawful within the Hong Kong legal system *at the time the Basic Law was promulgated in 1990*.  This recognition could stem from legislation, policy, or established practice.  The court emphasized that the intention was to protect rights that were already accepted as legitimate, not to subject them to retrospective legal challenges.

**5.  The Ding Rights are Protected:** The court definitively held that the “Ding Rights” – the right of male NTIIs to apply for small house grants – *are* lawful traditional rights and interests protected by BL40. This is because the right to build houses on ancestral land was a long-standing practice recognized by the colonial administration and formalized in subsequent policies.  The court acknowledged the discriminatory nature of the policy but found that this did not invalidate its protection under BL40.

**6. Coherence with Annex III of the Joint Declaration & Subsequent Legislation:** The court stressed the importance of interpreting BL40 in harmony with other provisions of the Basic Law, particularly Articles 120 and 122, which implement Annex III of the Joint Declaration. Annex III explicitly preserved land leases and rights related to them, including those pertaining to small houses. This demonstrates a clear intention to maintain the Small House Policy after the handover.  Furthermore, the court noted that subsequent legislation, like the Sex Discrimination Ordinance with its exemption for the Small House Policy, reinforces this intent.

**7. CEDAW Reservations & Discrimination:** The court acknowledged the discriminatory nature of the policy (specifically against women) but found that the UK and PRC governments’ reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) effectively shielded the policy from challenge on those grounds. These reservations, enshrined in Hong Kong law, demonstrate a deliberate decision to preserve the policy despite its discriminatory aspects.

**8. Standing and Delay:** While ultimately finding the policy constitutional, the court criticized the applicants for the significant delay in bringing the challenge and questioned their standing, as they lacked a direct interest in the policy’s application.



**Novel and Controversial Aspects:**

*   **Rejection of the “Tracing Exercise”:** The court’s rejection of the lower court’s requirement to trace rights directly back to pre-1898 practices is a significant departure. It broadens the scope of protection under BL40, focusing on recognition at the time of the Basic Law’s drafting rather than historical purity. This could have implications for other claims based on traditional rights.
*   **Balancing Discrimination and Historical Context:** The court’s willingness to uphold a discriminatory policy based on its historical context and the CEDAW reservations is likely to be controversial. It highlights the tension between modern equality principles and the preservation of unique cultural practices.
*   **Interpretation of “Lawful”:** The court’s interpretation of “lawful” as meaning recognition within the legal system at the time of the Basic Law, rather than current legality, is a pragmatic approach that prioritizes stability and the preservation of existing rights. However, it could be seen as weakening the constitutional protection against unlawful discrimination.



In conclusion, *Kwok Cheuk Kin* provides a comprehensive and historically informed interpretation of Article 40 of the Basic Law, affirming the constitutional validity of the Small House Policy while acknowledging its inherent discriminatory aspects. The case establishes a framework for understanding the protection of traditional rights that prioritizes historical recognition and the preservation of unique cultural practices within the context of Hong Kong’s constitutional framework.
