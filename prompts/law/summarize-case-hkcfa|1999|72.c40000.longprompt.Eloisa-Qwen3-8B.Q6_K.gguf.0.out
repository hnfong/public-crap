Okay, I need to tackle this case summary. Let me start by understanding the case. The case is Ng Ka Ling and another v. Director of Immigration. It's about the interpretation of Hong Kong's Basic Law regarding the right of abode for permanent residents, especially those born in mainland China to Hong Kong residents.

First, the facts: The applicants are Chinese nationals born in mainland China but whose parents were Hong Kong permanent residents. They arrived in Hong Kong after July 1, 1997, and claimed their right of abode under Article 24(2)(3) of the Basic Law. The Director of Immigration denied their claims, citing a scheme under the Immigration (Amendment) (No 3) Ordinance that required them to have a "one-way permit" from mainland authorities. The applicants challenged this in court, arguing it violated their constitutional rights.

Now, the arguments. The applicants argued that the Basic Law grants them the right of abode as permanent residents, and the Director's scheme was unconstitutional because it imposed additional requirements not in the Basic Law. They also pointed out that the scheme's retrospective application violated international human rights standards. The Director, on the other hand, argued that Article 22(4) of the Basic Law, which deals with entry from mainland China, authorized the scheme. They also claimed that the applicants' status as mainland residents meant they needed approval to enter Hong Kong, hence the requirement for the one-way permit.

For the legal principles, the Court of Final Appeal held that the Basic Law's provisions on permanent residents and their rights are clear and should be interpreted generously. The right of abode is a core right, and the scheme requiring a one-way permit was unconstitutional as it went beyond what the Basic Law allowed. The Court emphasized that the High Degree of Autonomy granted to Hong Kong under "one country, two systems" meant that mainland authorities couldn't impose such restrictions. The Court also ruled that the retrospective application of the scheme was invalid under Article 15(1) of the ICCPR. Additionally, the Court struck down the provision in the Immigration Ordinance that discriminated against children born out of wedlock by excluding them from the father's parent-child relationship, citing principles of equality and family protection.

What's striking about this case is how it navigated the complex interplay between Hong Kong's autonomy and mainland China's control, especially regarding immigration. The Court's decision reinforced Hong Kong's constitutional rights while respecting the Basic Law's framework. The detailed analysis of the Basic Law's provisions and the emphasis on human rights principles are remarkable, especially in a case with significant political implications.

### 1. Summary of the Facts

This case revolves around the interpretation of Hong Kong's Basic Law regarding the right of abode for permanent residents, particularly those born in mainland China to Hong Kong residents. The applicants—Miss Ng Ka Ling, Miss Ng Tan Tan, Mr. Tsui Kuen Nang, and Miss Cheung Lai Wah—are Chinese nationals born in mainland China but whose parents were Hong Kong permanent residents. They arrived in Hong Kong after July 1, 1997, and claimed their right of abode under Article 24(2)(3) of the Basic Law, which grants permanent residents the right to reside in Hong Kong. However, the Director of Immigration denied their claims, citing a scheme under the Immigration (Amendment) (No 3) Ordinance (the "No 3 Ordinance") that required them to hold a "one-way permit" issued by mainland authorities as a prerequisite for enjoying the right of abode. The applicants challenged this in court, arguing that the scheme violated their constitutional rights under the Basic Law. The case involved judicial review proceedings, with the applicants seeking declarations and orders quashing the Director's decisions. The Court of Final Appeal ultimately ruled on the constitutionality of the No 3 Ordinance and related provisions.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties

**Applicants' Arguments:**  
The applicants argued that the Basic Law grants them the right of abode as permanent residents, and the Director's scheme under the No 3 Ordinance was unconstitutional. They contended that the scheme's requirement of a "one-way permit" from mainland authorities was not mandated by the Basic Law and violated the High Degree of Autonomy granted to Hong Kong under the "one country, two systems" principle. They also highlighted that the scheme's retrospective application (effective from July 1, 1997) violated international human rights standards, particularly Article 15(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which prohibits retroactive criminalization. Additionally, the applicants challenged a provision in the Immigration Ordinance that discriminated against children born out of wedlock by excluding them from the father's parent-child relationship, arguing it violated principles of equality and family protection enshrined in the Basic Law and ICCPR.

**Director's Arguments:**  
The Director argued that Article 22(4) of the Basic Law, which regulates entry from mainland China, authorized the scheme requiring the "one-way permit." They maintained that the applicants, as mainland residents, needed approval to enter Hong Kong, and the permit was a necessary condition for establishing their right of abode. The Director also claimed that the applicants' status as permanent residents did not automatically grant them the right to reside in Hong Kong without compliance with mainland immigration controls. Furthermore, the Director supported the discriminatory provision in the Immigration Ordinance, arguing it reflected the "common view" of the British and Chinese governments and was consistent with the Joint Declaration and Basic Law.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) of the Case

The Court of Final Appeal delivered a detailed and unanimous judgment, establishing several key legal principles:

#### **(1) Interpretation of the Basic Law and the Right of Abode**  
The Court emphasized that the Basic Law is a constitutional instrument designed to implement the "one country, two systems" principle, granting Hong Kong a High Degree of Autonomy. The right of abode for permanent residents, as defined in Article 24(3), is a core constitutional right and must be interpreted generously. The Court rejected the Director's argument that Article 22(4) qualified this right, stating that permanent residents are not "people from other parts of China" and are not subject to mainland immigration controls. The Court held that the Basic Law's provisions on permanent residents and their rights are clear and self-contained, and any attempt to subordinate them to mainland regulations would undermine Hong Kong's autonomy.

#### **(2) Unconstitutionality of the No 3 Ordinance's Scheme**  
The Court struck down the scheme introduced by the No 3 Ordinance, which required permanent residents to hold a "one-way permit" from mainland authorities to enjoy the right of abode. The Court ruled that this requirement was unconstitutional because:  
- It exceeded the scope of the Basic Law and violated the High Degree of Autonomy.  
- It imposed retrospective obligations on applicants who had already established their right of abode under the Basic Law.  
- It conflicted with Article 15(1) of the ICCPR, which prohibits retroactive criminalization.  

The Court severed the unconstitutional parts of the No 3 Ordinance, retaining only provisions related to verification of permanent residency claims (e.g., the certificate of entitlement process).

#### **(3) Retroactivity and Human Rights Protections**  
The Court invalidated the retrospective provision of the No 3 Ordinance (Section 1(2)), which made it effective from July 1, 1997. The Court held that retroactive application of laws that strip individuals of their constitutional rights violates Article 15(1) of the ICCPR. This principle was applied to protect the applicants, who had already exercised their right of abode before the scheme's enactment.

#### **(4) Equality and Non-Discrimination**  
The Court struck down the discriminatory provision in the Immigration Ordinance (Schedule 1, Paragraph 1(2)(b)), which excluded children born out of wedlock from the father's parent-child relationship. The Court emphasized that the Basic Law and ICCPR enshrine principles of equality and family protection, and the provision violated these by treating illegitimate children differently from legitimate ones. The Court held that the plain meaning of Article 24(2)(3) includes all children born of permanent residents, regardless of marital status.

#### **(5) Constitutional Jurisdiction of Hong Kong Courts**  
The Court affirmed that Hong Kong courts have the authority to interpret the Basic Law independently, without seeking interpretations from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, unless the provisions in question relate to matters of central government responsibility or the relationship between the Central Authorities and Hong Kong. This reinforced the High Degree of Autonomy and the independence of Hong Kong's judiciary.

- **Detailed Legal Analysis:** The judgment provided an exhaustive interpretation of the Basic Law, highlighting the importance of generous and purposive interpretation in constitutional matters.  
- **Impact on Family Rights:** The Court's rejection of the discriminatory provision in the Immigration Ordinance underscored its commitment to equality and family protection, marking a significant shift in Hong Kong's legal approach to kinship and residency.  
- **Judicial Independence:** The unanimous decision and the Court's assertion of its jurisdiction to interpret the Basic Law independently highlighted the strength of Hong Kong's judicial system under the "one country, two systems" framework.  

Overall, the case is a landmark in Hong Kong's constitutional jurisprudence, blending legal technicality with profound implications for human rights, autonomy, and family rights. [end of text]
