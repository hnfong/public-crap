Okay, let's tackle this case summary. The user provided a detailed judgment from the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal in Secretary for Justice v. Cheng Ka Yee. The tasks are to summarize the facts, the arguments of both parties, the legal principles (ratio decidendi), and any striking aspects of the case.

First, I need to read through the judgment carefully. The case is about whether using one's own computer to access information for dishonest gain falls under section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance. The respondents were teachers who leaked interview questions for a school admission process. They used their phones and a school computer to send the questions to others. The prosecution charged them under s.161(1)(c), but the magistrates acquitted them, and the appeal was about whether the statute applies when the computer used is the offender's own.

For the facts summary, I should note the key points: the teachers took photos of interview questions, sent them via WhatsApp and email, used their own phones or the school's computer. The charges were based on using a computer (their phones or the school's) with dishonest intent. The magistrates acquitted because of lack of evidence on confidentiality and dishonesty, but the appeal focused on the legal question of whether the statute covers using one's own computer.

Next, the arguments. The appellant (Secretary for Justice) argued that s.161(1)(c) should apply to any computer, including the offender's own, to cover modern computer crimes. They cited examples like phishing, hacking, etc. The respondents argued that the statute's language and purpose limit it to accessing someone else's computer. The court agreed with the respondents, saying the ordinary meaning of "obtains access" implies accessing another's computer, not one's own.

For the ratio decidendi, I need to detail the legal principles. The court looked at the text, context, and purpose. The key points are the ordinary meaning of "obtains access," the legislative history showing the purpose was to cover preparatory acts involving others' computers, and the statutory context where other provisions (like s.27A) refer to unauthorized access to others' computers. The court rejected the appellant's argument that the statute should be interpreted broadly to cover modern crimes, emphasizing that courts don't rewrite statutes for policy reasons.

Striking aspects: The case is notable for clarifying that a statute meant to cover preparatory computer crimes doesn't apply to using one's own device. It's a narrow interpretation, which might leave some modern crimes unpunishable under this section, but the court stuck to the text. Also, the teachers were leaking school interview questions, which is a bit mundane compared to typical cybercrime cases, but the legal issue was about the statute's scope.

Wait, let me check if I missed anything. The court mentioned that the third respondent used the school's computer, but the appellant conceded it's treated as her own for the appeal. So the main issue was whether using one's own phone (for the first, second, fourth respondents) or the school's computer (third) counts. But since the school's computer was conceded to be like her own, the focus was on the own-device issue.

Also, the legislative history: the Working Group recommended "dishonest accessing" which included "with or without due authority," but that phrase wasn't included in the final statute. The court noted that the omission is neutral, but the context points to accessing others' computers.

The appellant's argument about technology evolving since 1993 was rejected because the court's role is to interpret the statute as written, not to expand it for policy reasons. The court cited that in China Field Ltd v Appeal Tribunal, courts shouldn't adopt constructions to advance public policy.

I should make sure the ratio decidendi is thorough. The key points are: 1) Ordinary meaning of "obtains access" implies accessing another's computer. 2) Legislative purpose was to cover preparatory acts involving others' computers. 3) Statutory context (other provisions like s.27A) supports this. 4) The court rejected the argument that the statute should be interpreted broadly to cover modern crimes, as that's for the legislature, not the judiciary.

For the striking aspects, the case is unusual because it's about teachers leaking school interview questions, which is a relatively minor offense compared to typical cybercrimes, but the legal question was about the scope of a computer crime statute. Also, the court's strict textual interpretation over policy considerations is notable, especially in the context of evolving technology.

Wait, the user asked for "anything striking, unusual or remarkable." The fact that the case involved primary school teachers and admission interviews, not high-tech hacking, might be striking. Also, the court's refusal to expand the statute despite the appellant's arguments about modern cybercrimes. The case is a good example of judicial restraint in statutory interpretation.

Let me check if I have all the tasks covered. Facts: teachers leaked questions using their phones and a school computer, charged under s.161(1)(c), acquitted, appeal on whether statute applies to own computer. Arguments: appellant says yes, respondents say no. Ratio: text, context, purpose point to not applying to own computer. Striking: mundane facts vs. legal significance, judicial restraint.

Wait, the court also mentioned that the use of the school computer by the third respondent was conceded to be like her own, so the appeal was really about the own-device issue. The court's conclusion that s.161 doesn't apply to using one's own computer unless accessing another's. So the key legal principle is that the statute requires accessing a computer other than the offender's own.

I need to make sure the ratio decidendi is detailed. The court analyzed the wording: "obtains access to a computer" – "obtain" means to secure access, which implies not having it before, so using your own computer doesn't involve obtaining access. The context: other provisions (s.27A) refer to unauthorized access to others' computers. Legislative history: the purpose was to cover preparatory acts for crimes involving others' computers. The court rejected the appellant's examples because those cases might fall under other statutes, like theft or fraud, not necessarily s.161.

Also, the court noted that the Bill originally had a definition that a person obtains access if they cause a computer to perform a function, but that was deleted. So the current wording doesn't include that, which would have made it broader. The deletion suggests the legislature intended a narrower scope.

Another point: the court distinguished between "access" as in gaining entry to a system (which would require someone else's computer) versus using one's own device. So taking a
