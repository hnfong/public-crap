Okay, let's tackle this case summary. The user provided a detailed judgment from the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal in Secretary for Justice v. Cheng Ka Yee. The tasks are to summarize the facts, the arguments of both parties, the legal principles (ratio decidendi), and any striking aspects of the case.

First, I need to read through the judgment carefully. The case is about whether using one's own computer to access information for dishonest gain falls under section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance. The respondents were teachers who leaked interview questions for a school admission process. They used their phones and a school computer to send the questions to others. The prosecution charged them under s.161(1)(c), but the magistrates acquitted them, and the appeal was about whether the statute applies when the computer used is the offender's own.

For the facts summary, I should note the key points: the teachers took photos of interview questions, sent them via WhatsApp and email, used their own phones or the school's computer. The charges were based on using a computer (their phones or the school's) with dishonest intent. The magistrates acquitted because of lack of evidence on confidentiality and dishonesty, but the appeal focused on the legal question of whether the statute covers using one's own computer.

Next, the arguments. The appellant (Secretary for Justice) argued that s.161(1)(c) should apply to any computer, including the offender's own, to cover modern computer crimes. They cited examples like phishing, hacking, etc. The respondents argued that the statute's language and purpose limit it to accessing someone else's computer. The court agreed with the respondents, saying the ordinary meaning of "obtains access" implies accessing another's computer, not one's own.

For the ratio decidendi, I need to detail the legal principles. The court looked at the text, context, and purpose. The key points are the ordinary meaning of "obtains access," the legislative history showing the purpose was to cover preparatory acts involving others' computers, and the statutory context where other provisions (like s.27A) refer to unauthorized access to others' computers. The court rejected the appellant's argument that the statute should be interpreted broadly to cover modern crimes, emphasizing that courts don't rewrite statutes for policy reasons.

Striking aspects: The case is notable for clarifying that a statute meant to cover preparatory computer crimes doesn't apply to using one's own device. It's a narrow interpretation, which might leave some modern crimes unpunishable under this section, but the court stuck to the text. Also, the teachers were leaking school interview questions, which is a bit mundane compared to typical cybercrime cases, but the legal issue was about the statute's scope.

Wait, let me check if I missed anything. The court mentioned that the third respondent used the school's computer, but the appellant conceded it's treated as her own for the appeal. So the main issue was whether using one's own phone (for the first, second, fourth respondents) or the school's computer (third) counts. But since the school's computer was conceded to be like her own, the focus was on the own-device issue.

Also, the legislative history: the Working Group recommended "dishonest accessing" which included "with or without due authority," but that phrase wasn't included in the final statute. The court noted that the omission is neutral, but the context points to accessing others' computers.

The appellant's argument about technology evolving since 1993 was rejected because the court's role is to interpret the statute as written, not to expand it for policy reasons. The court cited that in China Field Ltd v Appeal Tribunal, courts shouldn't adopt constructions to advance public policy.

I should make sure the ratio decidendi is thorough. The key points are: 1) Ordinary meaning of "obtains access" implies accessing another's computer. 2) Legislative purpose was to cover preparatory acts involving others' computers. 3) Statutory context (other provisions like s.27A) supports this. 4) The court rejected the argument that the statute should be interpreted broadly to cover modern crimes, as that's for the legislature, not the judiciary.

For the striking aspects, the case is unusual because it's about teachers leaking school interview questions, which is a relatively minor offense compared to typical cybercrimes, but the legal question was about the scope of a computer crime statute. Also, the court's strict textual interpretation over policy considerations is notable, especially in the context of evolving technology.

Wait, the user asked for "anything striking, unusual or remarkable." The fact that the case involved primary school teachers and admission interviews, not high-tech hacking, might be striking. Also, the court's refusal to expand the statute despite the appellant's arguments about modern cybercrimes. The case is a good example of judicial restraint in statutory interpretation.

Let me check if I have all the tasks covered. Facts: teachers leaked questions using their phones and a school computer, charged under s.161(1)(c), acquitted, appeal on whether statute applies to own computer. Arguments: appellant says yes, respondents say no. Ratio: text, context, purpose point to not applying to own computer. Striking: mundane facts vs. legal significance, judicial restraint.

Wait, the court also mentioned that the use of the school computer by the third respondent was conceded to be like her own, so the appeal was really about the own-device issue. The court's conclusion that s.161 doesn't apply to using one's own computer unless accessing another's. So the key legal principle is that the statute requires accessing a computer other than the offender's own.

I need to make sure the ratio decidendi is detailed. The court analyzed the wording: "obtains access to a computer" – "obtain" means to secure access, which implies not having it before, so using your own computer doesn't involve obtaining access. The context: other provisions (s.27A) refer to unauthorized access to others' computers. Legislative history: the purpose was to cover preparatory acts for crimes involving others' computers. The court rejected the appellant's examples because those cases might fall under other statutes, like theft or fraud, not necessarily s.161.

Also, the court noted that the Bill originally had a definition that a person obtains access if they cause a computer to perform a function, but that was deleted. So the current wording doesn't include that, which would have made it broader. The deletion suggests the legislature intended a narrower scope.

Another point: the court distinguished between "access" as in gaining entry to a system (which would require someone else's computer) versus using one's own device. So taking a photo on your own phone isn't "obtaining access" to the phone; you already have access.

Wait, the respondents used their phones to take photos and send them. The prosecution said they obtained access to the computer (the phone) to send the photos. But the court said that using your own phone doesn't involve "obtaining access" because you already have access. So the actus reus isn't met because "obtaining access" implies gaining access where you didn't have it before.

That's a crucial point. So the key legal principle is that "obtains access" requires the computer to be one that the person does not already have access to. Therefore, using your own device doesn't satisfy that element.

I should make sure that's clear in the ratio. The court's reasoning hinges on the ordinary meaning of "obtains access," which implies a prior lack of access. So if you're using your own computer, you already have access, so you don't "obtain" access. Hence, the offense isn't committed.

Also, the court rejected the idea that the statute should be interpreted broadly to cover modern crimes. The appellant argued that technology has advanced, but the court said that's for the legislature, not the courts. So the ratio includes the principle that statutory interpretation should stick to the text and purpose, not expand it for policy reasons.

For the striking aspects, the case is remarkable because it's a relatively low-stakes situation (leaking school interview questions) that led to a significant clarification of a computer crime statute. It's also notable that the court refused to stretch the statute to cover modern cybercrimes, even though the prosecution argued it was necessary. This shows judicial restraint, which might be controversial in some circles, but the court prioritized textual interpretation.

Wait, the user mentioned "novel or controversial" points. The controversial part might be the court's refusal to interpret the statute more broadly, especially given the rapid evolution of technology. Some might argue that the statute should be interpreted to cover such cases, but the court held firm to the text. So that's a novel or controversial point in the ratio.

Also, the case clarifies that s.161(1)(c) is about the act of accessing a computer (i.e., gaining entry), not about the use of the computer. So even if you use your own computer to commit a crime, if you didn't "obtain access" (since you already had it), it's not covered. That's a key distinction.

Let me check the judgment again. The judge says: "the use by the first, second and fourth respondents of their own smartphones to take photographs and to receive/send them by WhatsApp were not unauthorized extractions and use of information from the computer." Wait, but the offense is about obtaining access, not extracting information. Wait, the judge in the lower court said that the offense requires "unauthorized extraction and use of information," but the court here is saying that the actus reus is "obtaining access," not extraction. Wait, the court in the judgment says that the lower court held that the prosecution must prove "unauthorized extraction and use of information," but the court here is saying that the statute's wording is about "obtaining access," so the lower court's interpretation might have conflated the two.

Wait, the judgment states: "He held that to prove the commission of the offence, the prosecution must prove the unauthorized extraction and use of information from a computer." But the statute says "obtains access to a computer." So the lower court interpreted the offense as requiring extraction of information, but the Court of Final Appeal is saying that the key issue is whether "obtains access" includes using one's own computer. So the ratio decidendi is about the scope of "obtains access," not about extraction. The court clarifies that the offense is about obtaining access, not about the subsequent use of information. So the lower court's focus on extraction was a misstep, but the main issue was the "obtains access" part.

Wait, but the court in the judgment says: "the answer is no and the appeal by the Secretary for Justice must be dismissed." So the main point is that using one's own computer doesn't count as "obtaining access." The lower court's reasoning about extraction was a separate point, but the CFA focused on the "obtains access" element.

So in the ratio, the key is that "obtains access" requires the computer to be one that the person does not already have access to. Therefore, using one's own computer doesn't satisfy that element. The court also notes that the legislative purpose was to cover preparatory acts involving others' computers, so the statute isn't meant to cover using your own device.

Another point: the court mentions that the Working Group's draft included "with or without due authority," but that was omitted. So the absence of that phrase suggests that the legislature intended to cover only unauthorized access, which would include accessing others' computers without permission. But since the statute doesn't have "unauthorized," the court still interprets it based on context.

Wait, the statute says "obtains access," not "unauthorized access." The appellant argued that since "unauthorized" isn't in the statute, it should apply to any access, including authorized (like one's own). But the court says that the context and purpose imply that "obtains access" is meant to refer to unauthorized access, as seen in other provisions. So even though "unauthorized" isn't in s.161, the context suggests it's implied.

Wait, the court says in paragraph 41: "The word 'unauthorized' is comprehensively defined in s 27A(2). It does not appear in s 161(1). The appellant pointed to that difference in support of a submission that s 161(1) covered the use of one’s own computer, which could not be described as ‘unauthorized’." But the court counters that the difference doesn't overcome the inference from the use of "obtain" and "access" and the removal of the definition.

So the court's reasoning is that even though "unauthorized" isn't in s.161, the context (other provisions using "unauthorized") and the ordinary meaning of "obtains access" (which implies unauthorized access) mean that the statute is about unauthorized access, hence to others' computers.

Wait, but the statute doesn't say "unauthorized access," so the court is inferring that "obtains access" in this context means unauthorized access. So the key is that "obtains access" is shorthand for "obtains unauthorized access," which would require accessing a computer you don't have permission to access, i.e., someone else's.

Therefore, the ratio decidendi is that "obtains access to a computer" in s.161(1)(c) means obtaining unauthorized access to a computer other than the offender's own. Hence, using one's own computer doesn't satisfy the actus reus.

That's the core legal principle. The court's analysis of text, context, and purpose all lead to that conclusion.

Now, for the summary. Let me structure each part as per the tasks.

1. Facts: Teachers leaked interview questions via phones and school computer, charged under s.161(1)(c). Magistrates acquitted due to lack of evidence on confidentiality and dishonesty. Appeal focused on whether statute applies to using one's own computer.

2. Arguments: Appellant (prosecution) argued statute covers any computer use, including own, to combat modern cybercrime. Respondents argued statute's language and purpose limit it to accessing others' computers.

3. Ratio: The court held that "obtains access" implies unauthorized access to a computer not owned by the offender. Text (ordinary meaning of "obtain"), context (other provisions like s.27A), and purpose (preparatory acts involving others' computers) all support this. Court rejected appellant's policy arguments, emphasizing judicial restraint.

4. Striking: Mundane facts (school interview leaks) vs. significant legal principle; judicial refusal to expand statute for policy reasons; clarification that using own device isn't covered, which might leave some modern crimes unpunishable under this section.

Wait, but the court says that if the use involves accessing another's computer, it's covered by other statutes. So the case doesn't leave a lacuna; other laws apply. So the appellant's argument about a legal lacuna is addressed by the court saying that other provisions cover those cases.

I need to make sure that's clear in the ratio. The court states: "it was not suggested that the present case involved any of the respondents using their own devices to access another’s device. [So] the conduct is also likely to be covered by one of the other offences created or extended by the Computer Crimes Ordinance 1993."

So the court is saying that the statute's purpose is for preparatory acts involving others' computers, and if someone uses their own device to access another's, that's covered by other provisions. But in this case, the respondents didn't access another's computer; they used their own. So the statute doesn't apply, but other laws might.

Therefore, the ratio is that s.161(1)(c) doesn't apply to using one's own computer, but other statutes may apply to cases involving accessing others' computers.

Okay, that's important. So the court isn't saying that all such cases are unpunishable; just that this specific statute doesn't cover using one's own device. Other statutes (like theft or fraud) might apply.

Now, putting it all together. Let me check for any missed points. The court also mentioned that the lower court's focus on "unauthorized extraction" was a misinterpretation, but the main issue was "obtains access." So the ratio is about the actus reus being "obtains access," not extraction.

Another point: the court rejected the idea that the statute's wording is "essentially an offence of dishonesty" because the key element is the access, not the dishonesty. The dishonesty is part of the mens rea, but the actus reus is the access.

Wait, the statute says "with a view to dishonest gain," so the dishonesty is part of the mens rea. The actus reus is "obtains access." So the court is saying that the actus reus isn't met because using one's own computer doesn't involve obtaining access.

Yes, that's correct. So the key is the actus reus, not the mens rea. The magistrates acquitted on mens rea (dishonesty), but the appeal was about the actus reus.

So the ratio decidendi is that the actus reus of s.161(1)(c) requires obtaining access to a computer (i.e., unauthorized access to a computer other than the offender's own), which wasn't satisfied here because the respondents used their own devices.

I think that's all. Now, to write the summaries as per the tasks.

### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts  
The case involves four teachers (the respondents) accused of leaking confidential interview questions for a competitive admission process at a government-subsidized primary school in Hong Kong. On 13 June 2014, the first three respondents (teachers at the school) and the fourth respondent (a classmate of the second respondent) took photographs of interview questions distributed during a briefing session using their personal smartphones. They transmitted these photos via WhatsApp and email to third parties, including friends and other educators. The first respondent sent photos to a church friend, the second respondent shared them with the third respondent during the briefing, the third respondent typed the questions into a Word document on a school desktop computer and emailed it to the second respondent and a friend, and the fourth respondent sent photos to two friends via WhatsApp. All were charged under **s 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200)**, which criminalizes obtaining access to a computer with a view to dishonest gain. The magistrates acquitted them, citing insufficient evidence of confidentiality awareness and dishonesty. The Secretary for Justice appealed, arguing the statute applied to the respondents’ use of their own smartphones and the school computer. The Court of First Instance dismissed the appeal, holding that s 161(1)(c) does not cover the use of one’s own computer. The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) upheld this ruling, dismissing the appeal.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties  
**Appellant (Secretary for Justice):**  
The prosecution argued that **s 161(1)(c) applies to the use of any computer, including the offender’s own device**, as the statute’s language is broad and purposeful. They contended that:  
- The phrase “obtains access to a computer” has no inherent limitation to “others’ computers,” and the omission of “unauthorized” in the statute (unlike in s 27A of the Telecommunications Ordinance) means it covers all computer access.  
- Modern technology (e.g., social media, online fraud) necessitates a broad interpretation to address evolving cybercrimes, such as phishing, identity theft, and clandestine photography.  
- The statute’s purpose—to criminalize preparatory acts for dishonest gain—requires coverage of all computer misuse, including self-owned devices.  
- The lower court’s focus on “unauthorized extraction of information” (from *Li Man Wai v Secretary for Justice*) was a misreading; the offense hinges on “obtaining access,” not extraction.  

**Respondents:**  
The teachers argued that **s 161(1)(c) is limited to accessing *another person’s* computer**, as the statute’s language, context, and purpose imply. They contended:  
- The ordinary meaning of “obtains access” presupposes a *prior lack of access*, which does not apply to one’s own computer (e.g., using a personal smartphone to take photos is not “obtaining access” but *using* an already accessible device).  
- Legislative history (e.g., the Working Group’s recommendation for a “dishonest accessing” offense) and statutory context (e.g., s 27A of the Telecommunications Ordinance explicitly targets *unauthorized access to others’ computers*) confirm the statute’s scope.  
- The purpose of s 161 is to criminalize *preparatory acts* involving *others’ computers* (e.g., hacking into bank records), not self-directed misuse.  
- The prosecution’s examples (e.g., phishing, online fraud) fall under other statutes (e.g., Theft Ordinance), so s 161 need not be stretched to cover them.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) delivered a meticulous statutory interpretation, emphasizing **text, context, and purpose** to resolve whether *s 161(1)(c)* applies to the use of one’s own computer. The ratio decidendi is **thoroughly grounded in linguistic, contextual, and purposive analysis**, with the court rejecting the appellant’s expansive interpretation as judicial overreach.  

#### **Textual Analysis: The Ordinary Meaning of “Obtains Access”**  
The court began by scrutinizing the statutory language: *“Any person who obtains access to a computer … with a view to dishonest gain for himself or another.”* The key phrase is **“obtains access,”** which the court interpreted through its ordinary meaning. The *Shorter Oxford English Dictionary* defines “obtain” as “come into the possession or enjoyment of; secure or gain as the result of request or effort, acquire, get.” Crucially, this implies *gaining access to something previously inaccessible*. The court reasoned that **using one’s own computer cannot constitute “obtaining access”** because the user already possesses and enjoys access to it. For example, taking a photo on a personal smartphone does not involve “obtaining access” to the phone—it is merely *using* a device the user already controls. The court further noted the redundancy in the phrase *“obtains access to a computer”* (since “access” itself implies obtaining), which would be nonsensical if applied to self-owned devices. This linguistic analysis was decisive: **the actus reus of s 161(1)(c) requires *unauthorized access to a computer other than the offender’s own*.**  

#### **Contextual Analysis: Statutory Framework and Legislative History**  
The court examined the broader statutory context, particularly the **Computer Crimes Ordinance 1993**, which introduced *s 161*. The ordinance amended multiple statutes to address computer-related crimes, but **all other provisions (e.g., s 27A of the Telecommunications Ordinance) explicitly target *unauthorized access to others’ computers***. For instance, s 27A defines “unauthorized access” as access without authority to a computer *other than the offender’s*. The absence of “unauthorized” in *s 161(1)* was not dispositive, as the court inferred its *implied presence* from context. The legislative history reinforced this: the Working Group’s 1988 report recommended a new offense for “dishonest accessing” to criminalize *gaining access to computers with intent to deceive or gain*, which inherently implies *accessing another’s computer*. The Legislative Council’s Memorandum explicitly stated the purpose was to create a “new offence of ‘dishonest accessing’ … to make it unlawful to gain access to computers with intent to deceive, cause loss to another or gain for the offender.” The phrase *“gaining access”* inherently suggests *accessing a computer not owned by the offender*.  

The court also rejected the appellant’s reliance on the **deleted interpretive provision** in the original Bill (which defined “a person obtains access to a computer if he causes a computer to perform any function”). The deletion during legislative debate signaled the legislature’s intent to narrow the scope, as the Subcommittee sought to exclude accidental access (e.g., mistyping a key). Had the provision remained, it might have supported a broader interpretation, but its removal reinforced the court’s conclusion.  

#### **Purposive Analysis: The Statute’s Legislative Purpose**  
The court emphasized that **s 161(1)(c) was designed to criminalize *preparatory acts* for substantive offenses involving *others’ computers***, not self-directed misuse. The Legislative Council Memorandum clarified that the statute targets conduct *“falling short of the commission of a fraud”* (e.g., accessing bank records to gather credit details for later fraud). This purpose is *inherently tied to accessing *another person’s* computer*, as preparatory acts for fraud typically involve unauthorized intrusion into systems owned by others. The court rejected the appellant’s argument that the statute should cover modern crimes (e.g., social media harassment), noting that **such acts fall under other statutes** (e.g., Theft Ordinance, Public Order Ordinance). The court explicitly stated: *“The Court seeks to ascertain the purpose of the statute to inform its construction. It does not identify a purpose which it thinks would be beneficial and then construe the statute to fit it.”* This principle—**judicial restraint in statutory interpretation**—was pivotal. The court refused to expand *s 161* to address policy gaps, as that is the legislature’s role.  

#### **Rejection of the Appellant’s Policy Arguments**  
The appellant urged the court to adopt a *wider construction* to combat evolving cybercrimes, citing examples like phishing and identity theft. The court dismissed this as **legislative overreach**, stressing that **statutory interpretation must adhere to the text and purpose, not policy preferences**. The court cited *China Field Ltd v Appeal Tribunal* (2009), which held that courts should not “identify a purpose which it thinks would be beneficial and then construe the statute to fit it.” The court acknowledged that *s 161* might not cover all modern cybercrimes but clarified that **other provisions of the Crimes Ordinance and related statutes (e.g., Theft Ordinance, s 27A) already address such conduct**. For instance, phishing (sending false emails to steal credit card details) would fall under *s 161(1)(a)* (access with intent to commit an offence) or *s 161(1)(d)* (causing loss), but *only if* the access involves *another’s computer*. The court concluded that **the statute’s scope is inherently limited to *unauthorized access to others’ computers*, and the respondents’ use of their own devices did not satisfy this element**.  

#### **Novel and Controversial Aspects of the Ratio**  
The case’s **novelty** lies in its **strict textual interpretation of “obtains access”**—a phrase often conflated with *computer misuse* in public discourse. The court clarified that **the actus reus is *access*, not *use***: merely using a device (e.g., taking a photo on a smartphone) does not equate to “obtaining access” to the device. This distinction is critical, as it prevents *s 161* from being weaponized against routine digital activities (e.g., employees using personal devices for work). The **controversy** centers on whether the court’s narrow reading *undermines the statute’s purpose*. Critics might argue that *s 161* should cover *all* dishonest computer-related conduct, but the court’s reasoning aligns with the principle that **inchoate offenses (like preparatory acts) must have a clear, tangible actus reus**. The court’s refusal to stretch the statute to cover modern crimes, despite the appellant’s compelling policy arguments, underscores a **judicial commitment to textual fidelity over pragmatic expansion**—a stance that may influence future interpretations of similar statutes.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case  
**1. Mundane Facts vs. High-Stakes Legal Principle:**  
The case involves a seemingly trivial breach—leaking school interview questions—yet hinges on a **fundamental clarification of a computer crime statute**. The respondents were primary school teachers, not cybercriminals, and the offense was a *leak of confidential administrative material*, not a high-tech hack. This juxtaposition of *low-stakes facts* and *high-impact legal doctrine* is unusual. Most landmark computer crime cases involve sophisticated hacking or financial fraud, but here, the court grappled with whether *using one’s own phone* to send a photo constitutes a criminal offense.  

**2. Judicial Restraint in the Face of Technological Evolution:**  
The court’s **refusal to expand *s 161* to cover modern cybercrimes** is striking. The appellant presented compelling examples of evolving threats (e.g., social media stalking, distributed denial-of-service attacks), yet the court held that **the legislature—not the judiciary—must address gaps in the law**. This stance contrasts with trends in some jurisdictions (e.g., the U.S. *Computer Fraud and Abuse Act*), where courts have interpreted statutes more broadly to address new technologies. The CFA’s insistence on *textual fidelity* over policy adaptation is a rare and principled stand in an era of rapid technological change.  

**3. The “Own Device” Conundrum:**  
The case resolves a **practical ambiguity** that affects millions of users daily: *Does using your own smartphone to commit a crime (e.g., sending a photo) violate computer crime laws?* The court’s answer—**no, because you already have access to your own device**—is counterintuitive to laypersons but legally coherent. This clarification has **widespread implications** for digital privacy and criminal liability, particularly in workplace settings (e.g., employees using personal devices for work-related misconduct).  

**4. The Absence of a “Legal Lacuna”:**  
The appellant argued that the court’s narrow reading would create a *lacuna* for prosecuting modern cybercrimes, but the court **explicitly rejected this** by noting that other statutes (e.g., Theft Ordinance, s 27A) already cover such conduct. This dispels a common misconception that *s 161* is the sole remedy for computer misuse, highlighting the **coherence of Hong Kong’s cybercrime framework**.  

**5. The Role of Legislative History in Modern Interpretation:**  
The court’s deep dive into the **1988 Working Group report and 1993 Legislative Council debates**—decades after the statute’s enactment—demonstrates how **historical context remains vital** in statutory interpretation, even for outdated laws. This meticulous approach, rare in fast-paced digital contexts, underscores the court’s commitment to *original intent* over technological speculation.  

In summary, *Secretary for Justice v. Cheng Ka Yee* is remarkable for its **unusual facts, principled judicial restraint, and precise linguistic analysis**—a case where the law’s *text* triumphs over *technology’s evolution*, offering a rare model of statutory interpretation in the digital age.
