Okay, here's a breakdown of the bill, section by section, as requested.

**Sec. 80001. Exemption of Certain Assets.**

This section amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to expand the types of assets that are exempt from consideration when determining a student's financial eligibility for federal student aid. Specifically, it adds family farms on which the family resides, small businesses with 100 or fewer full-time equivalent employees, and commercial fishing businesses (including vessels and permits) to the list of assets that won't impact aid eligibility. These changes will take effect for the 2026-2027 award year and subsequent years.

**Sec. 81001. Establishment of Loan Limits for Graduate and Professional Students and Parent Borrowers; Termination of Graduate and Professional PLUS Loans.**

This section significantly alters federal student loan limits and availability. It terminates the authority to make Federal Direct PLUS loans to graduate and professional students starting July 1, 2026. It also establishes new annual and aggregate loan limits for graduate and professional students borrowing Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, with annual limits of $20,500 for non-professional graduate students and $50,000 for professional students, and aggregate limits of $100,000 for non-professional graduate students and $200,000 for professional students.  Parent borrowers will also face new annual ($20,000) and aggregate ($65,000) limits on Federal Direct PLUS loans.

**Sec. 82001. Loan Repayment.**

This section aims to streamline income-based repayment plans. It mandates that borrowers in existing income contingent repayment plans select either the Repayment Assistance Plan or an income-based repayment plan by July 1, 2028, with the Secretary automatically enrolling borrowers who fail to do so. It also amends the Higher Education Act to limit repayment plans available for loans made on or after July 1, 2026, to a standard repayment plan or the Repayment Assistance Plan.

**Sec. 82002. Deferment; Forbearance.**

This section modifies deferment and forbearance options for student loans. It sunsets unemployment and economic hardship deferments for loans originating on or after July 1, 2027. It also limits forbearance periods for loans originating after July 1, 2027, to a maximum of 9 months within any 24-month period.

**Sec. 82003. Loan Rehabilitation.**

This section eases the path to loan rehabilitation for borrowers in default. It increases the number of times a borrower can receive a loan rehabilitation from one to two. This change applies to FFEL and Direct Loans, as well as Perkins Loans, and takes effect July 1, 2027. It also sets a minimum monthly payment amount of $10 for borrowers with Direct Loans made on or after July 1, 2027.

**Sec. 82004. Public Service Loan Forgiveness.**

This section clarifies eligibility for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). It amends the Higher Education Act to allow on-time payments under the newly established Repayment Assistance Plan to count toward PSLF eligibility, in addition to existing qualifying repayment plans.

**Sec. 82005. Student Loan Servicing.**

**Sec. 83001. Eligibility.**

This section makes adjustments to Pell Grant eligibility. It sunsets the requirement to consider foreign income for Pell Grant eligibility determinations starting July 1, 2026. It also establishes a new ineligibility criterion: students with a Student Aid Index (SAI) exceeding twice the maximum Pell Grant amount will be ineligible.

**Sec. 83002. Workforce Pell Grants.**

This section creates a new Workforce Pell Grant program. It allows students enrolled in short-term, workforce-focused programs (150-600 clock hours) to be eligible for Pell Grants, provided the program meets specific criteria related to alignment with in-demand industries, employer hiring requirements, and credential portability. The program is designed to support training for high-skill, high-wage jobs.

**Sec. 83003. Pell Shortfall.**

This section increases the funding allocated to address the Pell Grant shortfall. It raises the amount from $2.17 billion to $12.67 billion.

**Sec. 83004. Federal Pell Grant Exclusion Relating to Other Grant Aid.**

This section limits Pell Grant eligibility for students receiving significant grant aid from non-federal sources. Starting July 1, 2026, students receiving non-federal grant aid equal to or exceeding their cost of attendance will be ineligible for a Pell Grant.

**Sec. 84001. Ineligibility Based on Low Earning Outcomes.**

This section introduces accountability measures for institutions of higher education based on student earning outcomes. Institutions with programs where graduates have median earnings below a certain threshold (compared to working adults) may be deemed ineligible to use federal funds for enrollment in those programs. The bill establishes an appeals process and requires institutions to inform students if their program is at risk of losing eligibility.

**Sec. 85001. Delay of Rule Relating to Borrower Defense to Repayment.**

This section delays the implementation of certain borrower defense to repayment regulations. It prevents the 2022 regulations regarding institutional eligibility from applying to loans originating before July 1, 2035, effectively restoring the regulations in place before November 1, 2022.
