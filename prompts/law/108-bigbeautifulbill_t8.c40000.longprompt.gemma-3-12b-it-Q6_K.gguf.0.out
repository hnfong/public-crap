Okay, here's a breakdown of the bill, section by section, as requested.

**Sec. 80001. Exemption of Certain Assets.**

This section amends the Higher Education Act to expand the types of assets that are exempt from consideration when determining a student's financial eligibility for federal student aid. Specifically, it allows family farms, small businesses (with 100 or fewer employees), and commercial fishing businesses to be excluded when calculating a student's financial need. This aims to prevent students from losing financial aid due to family-owned assets that are essential to their livelihood, and the changes will take effect for the 2026-2027 award year.

**Sec. 81001. Establishment of Loan Limits for Graduate and Professional Students and Parent Borrowers; Termination of Graduate and Professional PLUS Loans.**

This section significantly alters federal student loan programs for graduate and professional students. It terminates the Federal Direct PLUS loan program for graduate and professional students starting in 2026, and establishes new, lower annual and aggregate loan limits for Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford loans for these students, beginning in 2026.  Annual limits will be $20,500 for non-professional graduate students and $50,000 for professional students, with aggregate limits of $100,000 for non-professional and $200,000 for professional students, adjusted based on prior undergraduate borrowing.

**Sec. 82001. Loan Repayment.**

This section aims to streamline income-based repayment plans. It mandates that borrowers in existing income contingent repayment plans transition to either the Repayment Assistance Plan or the income-based repayment plan by July 2028, and the Secretary will automatically enroll borrowers who fail to select a plan.  It also repeals the authority for income contingent repayment plans and establishes a new standard repayment plan with fixed terms and limits, while also introducing the Repayment Assistance Plan with specific repayment terms and interest subsidy provisions.

**Sec. 82002. Deferment; Forbearance.**

This section modifies rules regarding student loan deferments and forbearances. It sunsets unemployment and economic hardship deferments for loans originating after July 1, 2027, and limits forbearance periods to a maximum of 9 months within a 24-month period for loans originating after that date. These changes are intended to reduce the potential for prolonged periods of non-payment and encourage borrowers to explore alternative repayment options.

**Sec. 82003. Loan Rehabilitation.**

This section eases the path to loan rehabilitation for borrowers in default. It increases the number of times a borrower can enter into a loan rehabilitation agreement from one to two, and sets a minimum monthly payment amount for borrowers with existing Direct Loans. This aims to provide more opportunities for borrowers to regain good standing and access federal student aid again.

**Sec. 82004. Public Service Loan Forgiveness.**

This section clarifies eligibility for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). It amends the rules to ensure that borrowers making on-time payments under the new Repayment Assistance Plan also qualify for PSLF, aligning repayment plan eligibility with the program's requirements. This aims to simplify the process and ensure that public servants receive the loan forgiveness they are entitled to.

**Sec. 82005. Student Loan Servicing.**

This section increases funding for student loan servicing. It appropriates an additional $1 billion to the Secretary of Education for administrative costs, including servicing the direct student loan programs. This aims to improve the efficiency and quality of loan servicing, benefiting both borrowers and the Department of Education.

**Sec. 83001. Eligibility.**

This section modifies Pell Grant eligibility rules. It sunsets the requirement to consider foreign income for Pell Grant eligibility starting July 1, 2026, and establishes a new ineligibility criterion based on a high Student Aid Index (SAI), excluding students with an SAI exceeding twice the maximum Pell Grant amount. This aims to simplify the eligibility determination process and potentially limit Pell Grants for higher-income students.

**Sec. 83002. Workforce Pell Grants.**

This section creates a new Workforce Pell Grant program. It allows students enrolled in short-term, workforce-focused programs (150-600 clock hours) to be eligible for Pell Grants, provided the programs meet specific criteria related to alignment with in-demand industries, completion rates, and job placement. This aims to expand Pell Grant access to students pursuing career training programs.

**Sec. 83003. Pell Shortfall.**

This section increases the funding level for the Pell Grant program. It raises the annual appropriation for the Pell Grant program from $2.17 billion to $12.67 billion, providing more resources to support students' educational expenses. This aims to address the Pell Grant shortfall and ensure that more students can access this vital form of financial aid.

**Sec. 83004. Federal Pell Grant Exclusion Relating to Other Grant Aid.**

This section introduces a new limitation on Pell Grant eligibility. It excludes students who receive grant aid from non-federal sources (like states or institutions) exceeding their cost of attendance from receiving a Pell Grant. This aims to prevent students from receiving duplicate financial aid and potentially redirect Pell Grant funds to students with greater need.

**Sec. 84001. Ineligibility Based on Low Earning Outcomes.**

This section introduces accountability measures for institutions of higher education based on student loan repayment outcomes. It requires institutions to demonstrate that their programs lead to reasonable earning outcomes for graduates, and institutions with programs that consistently result in low earnings may become ineligible for federal student aid funds. This aims to incentivize institutions to provide programs that prepare students for successful careers.

**Sec. 85001. Delay of Rule Relating to Borrower Defense to Repayment.**

This section delays the implementation of certain borrower defense to repayment regulations. It postpones the effective date of the 2022 regulations related to institutional eligibility under borrower defense to repayment for loans originating before July 1, 2035, reverting to the regulations in effect before the 2022 changes. This aims to provide temporary regulatory relief for institutions.

**Sec. 85002. Delay of Rule Relating to Closed School Discharges.**

This section also delays the implementation of regulations related to closed school discharges. It postpones the effective date of the 2022 regulations concerning closed school discharges for loans originating before July 1, 2035, reverting to the regulations in effect before the 2022 changes. This aims to provide temporary regulatory relief for institutions.

**Sec. 86001. Garden of Heroes.**

This section allocates funding for the creation of the National Garden of American Heroes. It appropriates $40 million to the National Endowment for the Humanities to procure statues for the garden, which is intended to honor prominent figures in American history. The funds will be available through fiscal year 2028.

**Sec. 87001. Potential Sponsor Vetting for Unaccompanied Alien Children Appropriation.**

This section provides funding to enhance vetting procedures for potential sponsors of unaccompanied alien children. It appropriates $300 million to the Office of Refugee Resettlement to support background checks, home studies, and data system improvements related to ensuring the safety and well-being of these children. This aims to strengthen the screening process for potential caregivers.
