## Answers to Questions Regarding the Protection of Critical Infrastructures (Computer Systems) Bill C2885

Here's a breakdown of the bill, addressing your questions in detail:

**Question A: Give me a summary of the bill, its purpose and major themes.**

**Summary:** This bill, the Protection of Critical Infrastructures (Computer Systems) Bill, establishes a framework for safeguarding Hong Kong's critical infrastructure from cyber threats. It does this by identifying critical infrastructures, designating operators of those infrastructures (CI Operators), and imposing security obligations on those operators. It also grants powers to regulating authorities (the Commissioner and designated authorities like the Monetary Authority and Communications Authority) to oversee compliance, investigate incidents, and respond to threats.

**Purpose:** The primary purpose is to enhance the security of essential services in Hong Kong by protecting the computer systems that underpin them. This is achieved through proactive measures like risk assessments, security management plans, and incident response protocols.

**Major Themes:**

*   **Critical Infrastructure Protection:** The central theme is the identification and protection of vital sectors (energy, finance, transport, healthcare, etc.).
*   **Cybersecurity Regulation:** The bill introduces a regulatory regime for CI Operators, mandating specific security practices.
*   **Government Oversight & Enforcement:**  It establishes clear roles and powers for regulating authorities to monitor, investigate, and enforce compliance.
*   **Information Sharing & Incident Response:** The bill emphasizes the importance of reporting security incidents and having robust response plans in place.
*   **Balance of Power & Privacy:** While granting significant powers to authorities, the bill includes provisions to protect informers and address potential legal challenges.
