Okay, let's tackle this case summary. The user provided a detailed judgment from the Hong Kong Court of Appeal, and they want four specific tasks done. Let me break down each part step by step.

First, I need to briefly summarize the facts. The case is Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v. Chan Chun Chuen and Another. The main issue is about the validity of two wills: the 2002 will and the 2006 will. The plaintiff, Chinachem Charitable Foundation, is the beneficiary under the 2002 will, while the first defendant, Chan Chun Chuen, claims to be the beneficiary under the 2006 will. The judge below found the 2006 will to be a forgery. I should note the key facts: Nina Wang was the chairwoman of Chinachem Group, worth around $100 billion. She had a relationship with the first defendant, who ran a feng shui school. There were significant financial transactions between them, including large payments. The 2002 will left everything to the charitable foundation, and the 2006 will was supposedly signed by Nina Wang but was later deemed a forgery. The judge found that the first defendant forged the will, and the evidence included the attesting witnesses' testimony and handwriting analysis.

Next, the arguments of the two parties. The plaintiff (Chinachem) argued that the 2006 will was a forgery, supported by the witnesses' testimony and handwriting experts. The first defendant (Chan) argued that the 2006 will was genuine, claiming Nina Wang loved him and wanted to leave her estate to him. He also challenged the judge's evaluation of inherent improbabilities and the handwriting analysis. The defendant's main points were that the judge didn't properly consider the inherent improbabilities and that the handwriting evidence was flawed.

Now, the legal principles (ratio decidendi). This is the meaty part. The court upheld the judge's finding that the 2006 will was a forgery. The key points here are the evaluation of the attesting witnesses' evidence, the handwriting analysis, and the application of the "statistical point" regarding rarities in signatures. The court emphasized that the judge properly considered the inherent improbabilities, which the defendant argued were mishandled. The novel aspect here is the detailed discussion on the "no-lose argument" and the treatment of rarities as differences in handwriting analysis. The court accepted Mr. Radley's approach that an accumulation of rare features in a signature is highly indicative of forgery, which aligns with Osborn's statistical approach. The court also rejected the defendant's arguments about the handwriting experts' methodologies, particularly the use of hospital signatures and the "no-lose" argument. The legal principle here is that when assessing signature authenticity, the accumulation of rare features (rarities) can be significant evidence of forgery, even if individual similarities exist. The court also stressed that the judge's findings on the witnesses' credibility were well-supported and not tainted by moral disapproval of the relationship.

Finally, anything striking or unusual. The case involves a massive estate ($100 billion), which is rare. The feng shui angle is unusual—Nina Wang's reliance on the first defendant for feng shui to locate her missing husband, and later for cancer treatment. The forgery involved a will signed by the deceased, with the first defendant keeping it secret until after her death. The court's detailed analysis of handwriting, including the statistical approach, is notable. Also, the judge's finding that the first defendant was a liar and untrustworthy, with specific examples like the false university education, adds to the unusual nature. The fact that the first defendant was married and had a secret relationship with Nina Wang, who was also a prominent philanthropist, adds a dramatic element. The use of scientific evidence in handwriting analysis, especially the discussion of "rarities" and the statistical point, is a key legal innovation here.

Wait, let me check if I missed anything. The court also addressed the costs, ordering indemnity costs because the defendant's actions were a gross abuse of court process. That's a significant point in the ratio decidendi, emphasizing the consequences of fraudulent litigation.

For the legal principles, I need to make sure to highlight the novel aspects. The "statistical point" where an accumulation of rare features is considered strong evidence of forgery, as per Osborn and Huber & Headrick. The court's rejection of the defendant's argument that the statistical point contradicts the Court of Final Appeal's guidance in Nina Kung. Also, the handling of the handwriting experts' methodologies, especially the exclusion of hospital signatures with poor pen control, which the judge deemed inappropriate.

Wait, the user mentioned focusing on novel or controversial points. The application of the statistical approach in handwriting analysis might be the novel part here. The court's acceptance of the "radley-osborn statistical point" as valid, even though it's a bit different from traditional methods. The court also clarified that equating rarities with differences is acceptable when properly explained, which was a point of contention.

Another thing is the judge's consideration of the inherent improbabilities. The defendant argued the judge didn't properly weigh them, but the court said the judge did consider them, and it's up to the judge's discretion how much weight to give each. So the legal principle here is that the evaluation of inherent improbabilities is a matter for the trial judge, and appellate courts shouldn't interfere unless there's a clear error.

Also, the court's emphasis on the credibility of the attesting witnesses. The judge found that the witnesses' accounts were consistent and credible, especially Mr. Wong's testimony about the will being partial. The court upheld that finding, which was crucial to the forgery conclusion.

For the striking aspects, the $100 billion estate is a big deal. The feng shui elements are unusual in a legal case. The fact that the first defendant was a married man with children, keeping the relationship secret, and the large sums of money involved. The detailed scientific analysis of the will's signature, including the crease in the paper, which was only discovered later through scientific tests. The fact that the first defendant produced a copy of the will with a different wording ("my" before his name), which had the same signatures in register, indicating it was a discarded draft. That's a clever detail showing the forgery.

Wait, the user asked for anything striking, not just legal. So the massive wealth, the feng shui angle, the secret relationship, the forgery being discovered through handwriting analysis and witness testimony, the court's strong language about the defendant's dishonesty. Also, the fact that the case went all the way to the Court of Appeal, and the first defendant's application to the Court of Final Appeal was refused.

Let me make sure I didn't miss any key points. The judge found that Nina Wang never deviated from her intention to leave the estate to the charitable foundation, which was supported by her actions even after the 2002 will. The payments to the first defendant were part of their relationship, but didn't affect her charitable intentions. The court rejected the idea that the 2002 will was a "public image enhancement exercise."

In the legal principles, the court's detailed analysis of the handwriting evidence is crucial. The court explained the difference between similarities and significant differences, and how rarities (unusual features) accumulate to indicate forgery. The "no-lose argument" where if the range of variation is too wide, a match is inevitable, so those features aren't significant. The court accepted that, which is a key point.

Also, the court's handling of the expert evidence: Mr. Radley's approach was upheld, and the judge's rejection of Mr. Westwood's evidence because he used deteriorated hospital signatures. The judge's reasoning on why those signatures were inappropriate (poor pen control) is important.

Wait, the user wants the ratio decidendi to be detailed and thorough. So I need to structure that part carefully, explaining the legal principles step by step, focusing on the novel aspects. The main ratio is that the judge's finding of forgery was correct based on the witnesses' testimony and the handwriting analysis, particularly the statistical approach to rarities. The court affirmed that the judge properly considered the inherent improbabilities and that the expert evidence was correctly assessed.

I should also mention that the court rejected the defendant's argument that the judge was morally offended by the relationship, emphasizing that the judge's findings were based on evidence, not personal bias.

For the striking aspects, the $100 billion estate is a standout. The feng shui elements are unusual in a probate case. The fact that the will was forged and the first defendant kept it secret until after Nina Wang's death, then revealed it publicly. The scientific details about the signature being written over a crease, which was only discovered later. The court's strong condemnation of the defendant's conduct, leading to indemnity costs.

Wait, the user mentioned "anything striking, unusual or remarkable about the case." So beyond the legal aspects, the personal drama: Nina Wang's husband was kidnapped and she believed he was alive for years, the feng shui rituals to find him, the secret affair, the massive financial transactions. The fact that the first defendant was a feng shui master, which is a bit out of the ordinary for a high-stakes probate case. The use of hole-digging as part of feng shui, which the judge found was genuine, not just a pretext. The correlation between the hole-digging activities and the payments to the first defendant, which the judge used to show the relationship's nature.

Also, the judge's finding that the relationship was clandestine, with the first defendant maintaining his family life while having an affair with Nina Wang. The fact that Nina Wang's relatives were appointed governors of the charitable foundation just before her death, reinforcing her commitment to the foundation.

I think that covers the main points. Now, I need to structure the answer according to the four tasks. Let me make sure each part is concise but thorough, especially the legal principles. The user said no word limit for that part, so I can go into detail there. But the summary of facts and arguments should be brief.

Wait, the user specified "briefly summarize" for the first two tasks, so I need to keep those short. The legal principles need to be detailed, so I'll elaborate on the key points: the evaluation of witnesses, the handwriting analysis with the statistical point, the handling of inherent improbabilities, and the costs order. The striking aspects should highlight the unusual elements like the estate size, feng shui, secret relationship, and the forensic details.

Let me check if I have all the key elements from the judgment. The judge found the 2006 will a forgery because the attesting witnesses testified that the document they witnessed was different (a partial will with a $10 million bequest to Mr. Chan), and the actual 2006 will had different wording. The handwriting analysis showed the signatures were forgeries. The court upheld all these findings.

Also, the first defendant's argument about the inherent improbabilities: the court said the judge did consider them, so that's not a valid point. The defendant's claim that the judge was biased against the relationship was rejected.

For the legal principles, the court's affirmation of the statistical approach in handwriting analysis is a key precedent. The court's reasoning on the "radley-osborn statistical point" and how it's applied in forgery cases. The court also clarified that the judge's exclusion of certain hospital signatures was proper because they had poor pen control, which is a standard in forensic handwriting analysis.

Wait, the user asked for the ratio decidendi. So the main legal principles are:

1. The evaluation of inherent improbabilities in fact-finding is a matter for the trial judge, and appellate courts should not interfere unless there's a clear error.

2. The use of statistical analysis in handwriting examination, particularly the accumulation of rare features (rarities) as evidence of forgery, is valid and should be considered by courts.

3. The exclusion of inappropriate comparison signatures (like those with poor pen control) is within the judge's discretion.

4. The credibility of witnesses, especially attesting witnesses, is crucial in will validity cases, and their testimony can be pivotal in determining forgery.

5. A party who knowingly presents a forged document as a will is guilty of a gross abuse of court process, warranting indemnity costs.

I need to make sure these are clearly laid out in the legal principles section. The novel aspects here are the detailed application of the statistical point in handwriting analysis, which might not have been as clearly articulated before in Hong Kong courts. The court's endorsement of this method adds to the legal principles.

Also, the court's rejection of the "no-lose argument" as a valid point against the expert's methodology. The court explained that if the range of variation is too wide, the match isn't significant, which is a key point in handwriting analysis.

Wait, the "no-lose argument" was Mr. Radley's point that if the range of variation is so wide that a match is inevitable, then those features don't have identification value. The court accepted this, which is a bit nuanced. So the legal principle here is that in handwriting analysis, the range of variation must be considered, and features within that range don't contribute to identifying a forgery.

Another point is the court's handling of the expert evidence. The judge's assessment of the experts' credibility, especially Mr. Westwood, was upheld. The court noted that the judge was not impressed by Mr. Westwood's evidence, which is a reminder that trial judges have discretion in evaluating expert testimony.

For the striking aspects, the $100 billion estate is a huge number, making this one of the most valuable probate cases. The feng shui elements are unique to this case. The fact that the will was forged and the first defendant was the one who presented it, leading to a court finding of fraud. The detailed forensic analysis of the will's physical characteristics (the crease in the paper) is also unusual.

Wait, the user mentioned "anything striking, unusual or remarkable about the case." So the fact that the first defendant was a feng shui master, the hole-digging rituals, the payments tied to these rituals, and the timing of the payments correlating with Nina Wang's health decline. The court's detailed account of these feng shui activities as part of the evidence to show the relationship's nature and the defendant's motives.

Also, the fact that the first defendant's wife was shown the will two days after it was supposedly signed, but he kept it secret until after Nina Wang's death. The deliberate publicity after her death is a key point in the forgery.

I think that's all. Now, I need to structure the answer as per the four tasks. Let me make sure each part is addressed concisely but thoroughly.

### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts  
The case involves a dispute over the validity of two wills executed by Nina Wang, the late chairwoman of the Chinachem Group (a private conglomerate valued at approximately $100 billion). The **2002 will** left her entire estate to the Chinachem Charitable Foundation (the plaintiff), a charity co-founded by her and her late husband, Teddy Wang. The **2006 will** (allegedly signed by Nina Wang on 16 October 2006) named the first defendant, Chan Chun Chuen—a feng shui master and long-term secret lover of Nina Wang—as the beneficiary. The plaintiff sought to probate the 2002 will and invalidate the 2006 will, which the first defendant claimed was genuine.  

The judge (Lam J) found the 2006 will to be a **forgery**, based on:  
- **Attending witnesses’ testimony**: Solicitor Mr. Winfield Wong and Mr. Ng Shung Mo (a Chinachem employee) testified that the document they witnessed on 16 October 2006 was a *partial will* (bequeathing $10 million to a Mr. Chan), not the 2006 will. The 2006 will lacked this bequest and contained other discrepancies.  
- **Handwriting analysis**: Experts concluded Nina Wang’s signature on the 2006 will was a *highly skilled simulation*, and Mr. Wong’s signature was also forged. The judge emphasized the *accumulation of rare features* in the signatures as critical evidence of forgery.  
- **Contextual evidence**: Nina Wang maintained a lifelong commitment to the charitable foundation, despite her relationship with Chan (which was kept secret). Large payments to Chan (e.g., $688 million in 2005–2007) were tied to feng shui rituals (e.g., hole-digging to locate her missing husband, later to combat her cancer), but she never altered her 2002 will. The judge rejected the first defendant’s claim that the 2002 will was a "public image enhancement exercise."  

The judge ordered the plaintiff to have costs on an indemnity basis, reflecting the first defendant’s *gross abuse of court process* in presenting a forged will.

### 2. Arguments of the Two Parties  
**Plaintiff (Chinachem Charitable Foundation)**:  
- The 2006 will was a **forgery**. The attending witnesses (Wong and Ng) testified that the document they witnessed was a *partial will* (not the 2006 will), and scientific analysis confirmed the signatures were forged.  
- Nina Wang’s consistent charitable intent (evidenced by her 2002 will, post-litigation philanthropy, and recent appointment of relatives as foundation governors) disproved the first defendant’s claim that she intended to disinherit the foundation.  
- The first defendant’s relationship with Nina Wang was *clandestine*, and his financial demands (e.g., $688 million payments) were part of a *transactional* relationship, not a genuine affectionate one.  

**First Defendant (Chan Chun Chuen)**:  
- The 2006 will was **genuine**. He claimed Nina Wang loved him deeply, intended to leave her estate to him, and gave him the will secretly on 16 October 2006.  
- The judge **misapplied inherent improbabilities** (e.g., the improbability of Nina Wang’s physical condition on 16 October 2006, the risk of forgery) and **disregarded evidence** (e.g., the $688 million payments as proof of affection).  
- The handwriting analysis was flawed: Mr. Radley’s methodology (e.g., treating "rarities" as "differences") was *unscientific*, and the judge improperly excluded hospital signatures for comparison.  

---

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The Court of Appeal upheld the judge’s finding that the 2006 will was a forgery, grounding its decision in three interconnected legal principles:  

#### **(a) Evaluation of Inherent Improbabilities in Fact-Finding**  
The first defendant argued the judge failed to properly weigh *inherent improbabilities* (e.g., the improbability of Nina Wang’s physical condition on 16 October 2006, the risk of forgery). The Court clarified that **trial judges must consider inherent improbabilities**, but *how much weight to assign* is a matter of judicial discretion. The judge’s detailed analysis (paragraphs 841–876 of his judgment) demonstrated he had fully considered these factors. The Court rejected the appeal on the basis that appellate courts cannot interfere with a judge’s *assessment of weight* unless it is unreasonable. This reaffirmed the principle that *inherent improbabilities are contextual tools for fact-finding, not automatic dispositive factors*.  

#### **(b) Statistical Approach to Handwriting Analysis: The "Rarity" Principle**  
The most novel and controversial aspect of the case centered on **handwriting analysis**. The judge accepted Mr. Radley’s methodology, which treated *rarities* (unusual features in signatures) as *differences* (indicative of forgery), rather than merely *similarities*. The Court elaborated on this **"Radley-Osborn statistical point"**:  
- **Core Principle**: An accumulation of rare features in a questioned signature is *highly improbable* to occur naturally, making it strong evidence of forgery. As Osborn (1929) noted, "the combination of all [rare features] in one signature is so improbable as to amount to very strong evidence of forgery."  
- **Rejection of "No-Lose" Argument**: The first defendant claimed Mr. Radley’s "no-lose" argument (that wide variation in genuine signatures renders matches inevitable) was flawed. The Court *rejected this*, holding that if a signature contains *multiple rare features*, the probability of coincidence is vanishingly small (e.g., odds of 1 in tens of trillions for Nina Wang’s signature).  
- **Exclusion of Inappropriate Signatures**: The judge excluded 42 hospital signatures (with poor pen control) as comparison specimens, deeming them *inappropriate* for analysis. The Court upheld this, emphasizing that *comparing like with like* (e.g., well-controlled signatures) is a cardinal principle in handwriting examination. Mr. Westwood’s reliance on deteriorated signatures was criticized as distorting the "range of variation."  

This principle is **novel in Hong Kong jurisprudence** for its explicit endorsement of statistical inference in handwriting analysis. The Court cited *Osborn* and *Huber & Headrick* to affirm that *likelihood ratios* (statistical tools) have a "vital role" in identifying forgeries, moving beyond traditional "differences vs. similarities" frameworks.  

#### **(c) Credibility of Attending Witnesses and the "Gross Abuse of Process"**  
The Court emphasized that **the credibility of attesting witnesses** is pivotal in will validity disputes. The judge found Mr. Wong’s testimony (that the document witnessed was a *partial will*) credible, while rejecting the first defendant’s claim that the 2006 will was genuine. The Court noted that the first defendant’s *false assertion* about his university education (a Georgetown University document falsely listed him as a "biological engineering graduate") further undermined his credibility.  

Crucially, the Court held that **presenting a forged will constitutes a "gross abuse of court process"**, warranting *indemnity costs*. The judge’s order for indemnity costs was affirmed, as the first defendant’s actions were "a thoroughly dishonest case" that "abused the process of and an affront to the court." This reinforced the principle that *fraudulent litigation* carries severe cost consequences, beyond mere legal liability.  

#### **(d) Rejection of Moral Bias as a Ground for Appeal**  
The first defendant claimed the judge was "morally offended" by his relationship with Nina Wang, tainting the judgment. The Court dismissed this, stating that *moral disapproval of a relationship does not invalidate factual findings* if the evidence supports them. The judge’s findings were based on *objective evidence* (e.g., the witnesses’ testimony, the physical characteristics of the will), not personal bias.  

---

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects  
Several elements of the case stand out as extraordinary:  

#### **(a) The $100 Billion Estate**  
The Chinachem Group’s valuation (estimated at $100 billion) makes this one of the **most valuable probate disputes in history**. The stakes were so high that the first defendant’s alleged forgery aimed to secure *unprecedented wealth*—a rare scenario in legal history.  

#### **(b) The Feng Shui Narrative**  
The case hinges on **feng shui rituals** as a central plot device:  
- Nina Wang engaged Chan as a feng shui master to locate her kidnapped husband (Teddy Wang), leading to *hole-digging exercises* (e.g., at Ap Lei Chau, where Teddy’s car was found).  
- After her cancer diagnosis (2004), Chan resumed feng shui services, with *increasing payments* correlating to *intensified rituals* (e.g., hole-digging at Chinachem sites).  
- The judge meticulously documented this *ritualistic pattern* (e.g., the "escalation of feng shui activities" table), treating it as *evidence of the relationship’s nature* rather than mere superstition. This is **unprecedented in probate law**, where such cultural practices are rarely scrutinized in court.  

#### **(c) The Secret Relationship and "Clandestine" Dynamics**  
Chan was **married with three children** and maintained a *secret affair* with Nina Wang, who was also a prominent philanthropist. The relationship was *surreptitious* (e.g., Chan spent holidays with his family, and Nina Wang understood they would not marry). The judge’s description of it as "a man having a family in which she would not be a member" underscores the *dramatic irony* of a $100 billion estate being contested over a clandestine affair.  

#### **(d) The Forensic Detail of the Forgery**  
The forgery’s *physical characteristics* were meticulously analyzed:  
- The Nina Wang signature was written *over a crease* in the paper, a detail only revealed through *scientific testing* (not visible to the naked eye).  
- A *discarded draft* of the will (with "my" before Chan’s name) was found to have the *same signatures in exact register*, confirming it was a *forged draft* discarded after the 2006 will was prepared.  
This level of forensic detail in a will forgery case is **uncommon**, highlighting the intersection of *cultural practices, forensic science, and high-stakes litigation*.  

#### **(e) The Court’s Moral Condemnation**  
The Court’s language was unusually *forceful*:  
> "The first defendant has persisted in pursuing a thoroughly dishonest case. In doing so, he has abused the process of the court."  
This *moral judgment*—rare in appellate judgments—underscored the *egregious nature* of the fraud, culminating in an *indemnity costs order* (a rare remedy for *abuse of process*).  

---

### Conclusion  
This case is remarkable for its **unprecedented scale** ($100 billion), **unusual cultural context** (feng shui as legal evidence), and **novel legal principles** (statistical handwriting analysis, inherent improbabilities in fact-finding). The Court’s detailed endorsement of the "radley-osborn statistical point" sets a precedent for future forgery cases, while the moral condemnation of the first defendant’s conduct reflects the gravity of *fraudulent litigation* in high-stakes probate disputes. The case remains a landmark in Hong Kong law for its fusion of *forensic science, cultural nuance, and judicial rigor*. [end of text]
