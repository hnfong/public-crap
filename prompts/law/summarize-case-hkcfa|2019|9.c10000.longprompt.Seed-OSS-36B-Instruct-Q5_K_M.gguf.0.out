Got it, let's tackle this case step by step. First, I need to remember the four tasks: facts, parties' arguments, legal principles (ratio), and anything striking. 

Starting with the facts. From the judgment, the respondents are four people: three primary school teachers and a friend. They were involved in leaking interview questions for a competitive school admission. The teachers took photos of the questions (on their phones) during a briefing, sent them via WhatsApp, and one used a school computer to type up the questions and email them. They were charged under s 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200), which prohibits obtaining access to a computer with a view to dishonest gain. The magistrate acquitted them, the Secretary of Justice appealed, but the High Court judge dismissed the appeal, focusing on whether using one's own computer (or phone) counts as "obtaining access to a computer" under the statute. The key issue on appeal to the CFA was whether s 161(1)(c) applies when the computer belongs to the person using it.

Next, the parties' arguments. The appellant (Secretary for Justice) argued that s 161(1)(c) should be broadly construed to include using one's own computer, regardless of authorization, because the statute's purpose is to combat computer misuse, and modern tech requires covering new offenses like hacking, phishing, etc. They also cited the legislative history where the offense was meant to cover preparatory acts, even if not authorized. The respondents argued that "obtaining access" implies accessing something not already in one's possession, so using your own computer doesn't count. They relied on the ordinary meaning of "obtain access"—you can't obtain access to your own computer—and the legislative purpose was to target unauthorized access to others' computers, not personal use.

Then, the legal principles (ratio decidendi). The main ratio is that s 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance does NOT apply to the use of a person's own computer, unless that use involves accessing another computer. The Court reached this by analyzing text, context, and purpose:

1. **Textual Analysis**: The words "obtain access" imply gaining entry to something one didn't previously have access to. "Obtain" means to acquire what you don't have, and "access" means admittance to use—so using your own computer doesn't involve "obtaining access" because you already have access. The Court noted that if the legislature wanted to include personal computers, it could have used broader language like "uses a computer" instead of "obtains access to a computer."

2. **Legislative History**: The offense was created to address preparatory acts (like accessing a computer to plan fraud) where the access itself wasn't a crime before. The Working Group and Legislative Council debates focused on "gaining access" to others' computers, not personal use. The original bill had a proposed definition of "access" that was deleted, but even so, the intent was to target unauthorized access to third-party computers, not one's own.

3. **Purpose**: The statute's purpose was to fill a gap where accessing a computer (to prepare for a crime) wasn't an offense. Targeting one's own computer doesn't serve this purpose—there's no "wrongful access" to another's property, and the policy rationale (preventing preparatory computer misuse) doesn't apply to personal devices. The Court rejected the appellant's argument that modern tech requires a broader construction, stating that courts don't rewrite statutes to fit desired policies; they apply the legislature's intent.

4. **Distinction from Other Offenses**: The Court noted that other computer crimes (like s 27A of Telecommunications Ordinance) specifically target unauthorized access to others' data, so s 161 isn't needed to cover personal use—those cases are already addressed by other provisions if there's unauthorized access to third-party computers.

Finally, anything striking or unusual. A few points: 

- **Concession by Appellant**: The appellant conceded that the third respondent (using the school computer) could be treated as using her own for the appeal, which simplified the issue but is notable because employer-provided computers might usually have authorization questions.

- **Focus on "Own Computer"**: The case turns on a narrow but critical distinction—whether "obtaining access" includes one's own device. This is novel because many computer crime statutes assume the target is a third-party computer, but here the issue was the opposite: using your own.

- **Rejection of Policy-Driven Construction**: The Court firmly rejected the appellant's request to expand the statute based on modern tech threats, emphasizing that statutory construction must follow the legislature's original purpose, not judicial policy-making. This is a reminder of the textualist/intentionalist approach in Hong Kong courts.

- **Acquittal Basis**: The magistrate originally acquitted on factual grounds (reasonable doubt about confidentiality and dishonesty), but the higher courts dismissed the appeal on legal grounds (actus reus not proven), showing how procedural/appellate paths can shift focus from facts to law.</seed:think>### 1. Brief Summary of Facts  
The case involves four respondents: three primary school teachers (from the Church of Christ in China Heep Woh Primary School) and a friend. In June 2014, during a briefing for competitive school admission interviews, the teachers took photographs of confidential interview questions using their personal smartphones and sent them via WhatsApp to third parties. One teacher also used a school desktop computer to type up the questions and email them to others. All four were charged under **s 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200)**, which prohibits "obtaining access to a computer with a view to dishonest gain for himself or another."  

The Magistrate acquitted them, finding reasonable doubt about whether the teachers knew the questions were confidential and whether dishonesty was proven. The Secretary for Justice appealed, but the High Court judge dismissed the appeal on a critical legal issue: **whether s 161(1)(c) applies when the computer used belongs to the accused**. The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) later heard the appeal, focusing on this constructional question.


### 2. Arguments of the Two Parties  
#### Appellant (Secretary for Justice)  
The appellant argued for a **broad construction** of s 161(1)(c), contending it applies to *any* use of a computer (including one’s own) with the requisite dishonest intent. Key points:  
- **Textual Ambiguity**: The statute’s wording ("obtains access to a computer") is broad enough to include personal devices, as "access" can mean using a computer to perform functions (e.g., sending photos via WhatsApp).  
- **Legislative Purpose**: The offense was created to criminalize preparatory computer misuse (e.g., accessing a computer to plan fraud) that previously escaped prosecution. Modern technology (e.g., hacking, phishing, online fraud) demands this broad interpretation to fill gaps in criminal law.  
- **Rejection of "Unauthorized" Requirement**: The appellant criticized the lower court’s focus on "unauthorized extraction" (from *Li Man Wai v Secretary for Justice*), arguing s 161 applies regardless of authorization—even to one’s own computer.  

#### Respondents  
The respondents argued for a **narrow construction**, limiting s 161(1)(c) to cases where the accused accesses *another person’s computer*. Key points:  
- **Ordinary Meaning of "Obtain Access"**: "Obtain" implies acquiring something not already possessed, and "access" means admittance to use. Using one’s own computer does not involve "obtaining access" because the user already has lawful access.  
- **Legislative History**: The offense was intended to target unauthorized access to *third-party computers*, as evidenced by the Working Group’s recommendation to criminalize "gaining access to computers" (implying others’ computers) and Legislative Council debates focusing on preparatory acts against others’ data.  
- **Policy Irrelevance**: Criminalizing personal computer use serves no legitimate purpose—there is no "wrongful access" to another’s property, and the statute’s goal (preventing preparatory computer crime) does not apply to personal devices.  


### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The CFA’s core holding is that **s 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance does not apply to the use of a person’s own computer, unless that use involves accessing another computer**. This conclusion rests on three interrelated analyses: text, context, and legislative purpose.  

#### a. Textual Construction: "Obtain Access" Implies Third-Party Computers  
The Court emphasized the ordinary meaning of "obtain access":  
- "Obtain" (defined as "acquire what one does not have") and "access" (admittance to use) inherently require gaining entry to something *not already in possession*. Using one’s own computer cannot qualify because the user already has lawful access.  
- The legislature could have used broader language (e.g., "uses a computer") if it intended to include personal devices. Instead, it chose "obtains access," which presupposes a transfer of access from another party.  

#### b. Legislative History: Targeting Unauthorized Third-Party Access  
The offense was created to address a gap in pre-1993 law: preparatory acts of accessing computers to plan fraud (e.g., stealing bank data) that were not criminalized until then. The Working Group’s recommendation explicitly referred to "gaining access to computers"—a phrase the Court interpreted as referring to *others’ computers*, not the user’s own. Legislative Council debates confirmed this: the statute was meant to penalize "access to a computer for acts preparatory but falling short of the commission of a fraud" (e.g., accessing a company’s computer to steal credit card details), not personal use.  

#### c. Purpose: Preventing Wrongful Access, Not Personal Misuse  
The statute’s purpose was to criminalize **wrongful access to another’s computer**, not personal computer use. The Court rejected the appellant’s argument that modern tech requires a broader construction, stating: "Courts do not identify a desirable public policy and construe the statute to fit it—they ascertain the legislature’s intent." Personal computer use does not involve "wrongful access" (a key policy rationale) and is already covered by other offenses (e.g., theft, fraud) if it causes harm to others.  

#### d. Distinction from Other Computer Crimes  
The Court noted that other provisions (e.g., s 27A of the Telecommunications Ordinance) specifically target unauthorized access to third-party data. S 161 is unnecessary to regulate personal computer use because such conduct, if harmful, is already addressed by existing laws (e.g., dishonest appropriation under the Theft Ordinance).  


### 4. Striking/Unusual Aspects  
- **Narrow Focus on "Own Computer"**: The case turns on a novel distinction—whether "obtaining access" includes one’s own device. Most computer crime statutes assume the target is a third-party computer, but here the issue was the inverse: using *your own* computer.  
- **Rejection of Policy-Driven Expansion**: The CFA firmly rejected the appellant’s plea to update the statute for modern tech, emphasizing that judicial restraint requires adhering to the legislature’s original purpose, not inventing new offenses. This is a rare rebuke to "living tree" interpretations in Hong Kong.  
- **Concession by the Appellant**: The appellant conceded that the third respondent (using a school computer) could be treated as using her own for the appeal, avoiding a separate debate about employer-provided devices. This simplified the legal issue but highlights the ambiguity around "authorized use" in workplace settings.  
- **Shift from Factual to Legal Appeal**: The original acquittal rested on factual doubts (confidentiality, dishonesty), but the higher courts dismissed the appeal on *legal grounds* (actus reus not proven), illustrating how appellate reviews can pivot from fact-finding to statutory construction.
