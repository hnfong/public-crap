Got it, let's tackle this. The user wants summaries for each Sec. starting with 40001 from the provided bill text. First, I need to go through each section one by one, extract the key points: what entity it affects, what changes are made (approvals, rescissions, amendments), specific amounts, timeframes, and any restrictions.

Starting with Sec. 40001: Coast Guard Mission Readiness. The text says it appropriates $24.59 billion to the Coast Guard for FY2025, available until 2029, for assets, maintenance, infrastructure. Then there are 13 subparagraphs with specific allocations: fixed-wing aircraft ($1.14B), rotary-wing ($2.28B), unmanned ($266M), Offshore Patrol Cutters ($4.3B), Fast Response Cutters ($1B), Polar Security ($4.3B), Arctic Security ($3.5B), icebreaking cutters ($816M), Waterways Commerce ($162M), shore facilities ($4.379B with suballocations), maintenance ($2.2B), maritime domain awareness ($170M), autonomous systems ($75M). Need to condense that concisely, hitting the total, purpose, and key specific allocations.

Sec. 40002: Spectrum Auctions. Amends Communications Act to extend FCC auction authority until 2034 (excluding 3.1-3.45GHz and 7.4-8.4GHz).

Assistant Secretary (Commerce) must identify 500MHz in 1.3-10.5GHz (excluding excluded bands) for reallocation by 4 years post-enactment, with FCC auctioning 200MHz by 4 years and rest by 8 years. Pres. can modify/withdraw frequencies 60 days before auction for national security. Appropriates $50M to Commerce for spectrum analysis (2.7-2.9GHz, 4.4-4.9GHz, 7.25-7.4GHz) and biennial reports on Federal spectrum value until 2034.

Requires DOT Secretary to impose user fees on space launches/reentries (2026+) : $0.25-$1.50/lb (increasing with CPI) or $30k-$200k (flat), whichever is less. 70% of fees go to the Fund for FAA commercial space ops and FAA Reauthorization Act Sec. 630(b), available without further appropriation.

Need to check each for conciseness: max 4 sentences, min 1, specific parties (Coast Guard, FCC, NASA, DOT, etc.), entities (FAA, NOAA, Airports Authority), quantities (dollars, MHz, years). Avoid vagueness, keep all significant details. Make sure each starts with Sec.
