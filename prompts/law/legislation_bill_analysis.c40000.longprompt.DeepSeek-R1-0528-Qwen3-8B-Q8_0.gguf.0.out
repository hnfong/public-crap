Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to understand the bill thoroughly. The Protection of Critical Infrastructures (Computer Systems) Bill seems to be a comprehensive piece of legislation aimed at safeguarding computer systems in critical infrastructures in Hong Kong. 

Starting with Question A, the summary should cover the main purpose and themes. The bill's title suggests it's about protecting computer systems in critical infrastructures. The Explanatory Memorandum states the main purposes clearly: protecting computer system security, regulating operators, and providing for investigations and responses to threats and incidents. The major themes would include designating critical infrastructures and operators, imposing organizational and security obligations, and establishing powers for authorities to investigate and enforce compliance.

For Question B, I need to identify who is impacted and who should be concerned. The bill mentions CI operators, who are organizations designated to manage critical infrastructures. These operators would be directly affected. Regulating authorities like the Commissioner and designated authorities would also be involved. Additionally, the general public and businesses relying on these critical infrastructures might be impacted. Legal professionals and government officials would need to be familiar with the legislation, especially those involved in enforcement, prosecution, or compliance. Concerned parties would include those responsible for critical infrastructure security, legal advisors, and possibly individuals whose privacy is covered under the bill.

Question C requires outlining new obligations and rights/powers. The obligations are placed on CI operators to maintain offices, set up security units, notify changes, submit security plans, conduct risk assessments, and implement emergency response plans. The regulating authorities are granted powers to issue directions, codes of practice, and to investigate. The Commissioner can perform functions even for those regulated by designated authorities if necessary. Designated authorities can prosecute certain offences. Also, the bill introduces legal professional privilege and immunity for compliance.

Question D is about listing all liabilities, including civil and criminal. The bill introduces various offences with corresponding fines and imprisonment terms. Civil liabilities include obligations to maintain offices, notify changes, and comply with directions. The liabilities arise from non-compliance with these obligations, failure to submit required reports, and other specified acts. The conditions for these liabilities are detailed in the bill, especially in the sections related to functions and requirements.
