Okay, I need to tackle these questions about the Protection of Critical Infrastructures (Computer Systems) Bill. Let me start by understanding each question and then go through the bill to find the answers.

**Question A: Summary, purpose, major themes**

First, I need to summarize the bill. The title mentions protecting critical infrastructures' computer systems. The purpose is likely to ensure cybersecurity for essential services. Major themes would involve regulation of operators, obligations on them, and responses to security threats.

Looking at the bill's structure: it has parts about regulating authorities, obligations of CI operators, responding to incidents, investigations, appeals, etc. The explanatory memorandum mentions protecting computer systems, regulating operators, and handling threats/incidents. So the summary should capture these elements.

**Question B: Who is impacted, needs to know, should be concerned**

The legislation affects Critical Infrastructure (CI) operators, designated authorities, and possibly other organizations involved with critical systems. CI operators in sectors like energy, finance, healthcare, etc., as listed in Schedule 1. Regulating authorities (Commissioner and designated authorities like Monetary Authority) are key. Also, any organization that might be designated as a CI operator or involved in incidents. They need to be familiar to comply. Those handling critical systems should be concerned about obligations and penalties.

**Question C: New obligations and rights/powers**

Obligations are on CI operators. From the bill: maintaining an office in HK, notifying changes, setting up security units, submitting security plans, conducting risk assessments and audits, reporting incidents, participating in drills, etc. The rights/powers are given to regulating authorities like the Commissioner and designated authorities. They can issue directions, codes of practice, require information, conduct investigations, issue warrants, prosecute offenses, etc.

**Question D: Liabilities (civil/criminal) and conditions**

Liabilities include fines and possible imprisonment. For example, failing to comply with obligations (like not maintaining an office) leads to fines. Section 18 has fines for not providing info. Section 28 has fines for not reporting incidents. There are also criminal offenses for non-compliance with directions (Section 7), investigations (Section 42), etc. The conditions are the specific failures to meet obligations or comply with legal requirements as outlined in each clause.

Now, I need to structure each answer clearly, ensuring all parts are covered without missing key points. Let me verify each section again to confirm details.
