Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a bill text and wants a summary of each section starting from Sec. 90001. They specified that for each section, I should give at most one paragraph with up to four sentences, be specific with parties, entities, and quantities, and keep it concise but detailed.

First, I need to go through each section listed in the bill. The user mentioned starting with Sec. 90001, so I'll begin there. Let me check the bill structure. The bill is divided into Titles, Subtitles, and Sections. The user provided the table of contents, so I can see all the sections they want summarized.

Looking at Sec. 90001: Border Infrastructure and Wall System. The section says there's an appropriation of $46,550,000,000 for fiscal year 2025, to remain available until 2029. The funds are for construction, installation, or improvement of barriers, access roads, barrier system attributes like cameras and sensors, and ground preparation. I need to mention the amount, the entity (Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection), the purpose, and the time frame. Let me make sure I get the numbers right. $46.55 billion, not $46,550,000,000. Wait, the text says $46,550,000,000, which is $46.55 billion. So I should write it as $46.55 billion to be concise.

Next, Sec. 90002: U.S. Customs and Border Protection Personnel, Fleet Vehicles, and Facilities. There are four subsections here. The total appropriation is $4.1B for personnel, $2.05263B for bonuses, $855M for vehicles, and $5B for facilities. Wait, the text says $4,100,000,000 for personnel, which is $4.1 billion. Then $2,052,630,000 for retention bonuses, which is approximately $2.05263 billion. Vehicles are $855 million, and facilities $5 billion. Also, there's a restriction that funds can't be used for processing coordinators after October 31, 2028. I need to list all these amounts and the restriction. But the user said at most four sentences. So maybe combine the amounts into one sentence and mention the restriction in another.

Sec. 90003: Detention Capacity. The appropriation is $45 billion for single adult and family residential centers. The section defines family residential centers and mentions detention standards set by the Secretary of Homeland Security. I should note the amount, the entity (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement), the purpose (detention capacity), and the definition. Wait, the section says "for single adult alien detention capacity and family residential center capacity." So the $45 billion covers both. Also, the detention standards are set by the Secretary, and the definition of family residential center is included. Need to be specific here.

Sec. 90004: Border Security, Technology, and Screening. The appropriation is $6,168,000,000. The subsections list eight items, but the user wants a summary. The key points are the $6.168 billion for procurement of nonintrusive inspection equipment, AI, machine learning, air and marine operations, border surveillance tech, biometric systems, screening, and combating drug trafficking. Also, a restriction on surveillance towers not tested by CBP. The definition of autonomous is included, but maybe that's not necessary for the summary. Focus on the amount, the main uses, and the restriction.

Sec. 90005: State and Local Assistance. This has two parts: State Homeland Security Grant Programs and the State Border Security Reinforcement Fund. The first part has $500M for UAS detection, $625M for FIFA World Cup, $1B for 2028 Olympics, and $450M for Operation Stonegarden. The second part is a $10 billion fund for states to build border walls, etc. Need to mention both parts, the amounts, and the purposes. Also, the restriction that states can't exercise federal immigration authorities.

Sec. 90006: Presidential Residence Protection. $300 million for reimbursement of state/local law enforcement costs for protecting presidential residences. The funds are available for costs incurred after July 1, 2024, and must be demonstrated as exceeding typical costs. Also, 3% for administration.

Sec. 90007: DHS Appropriations for Border Support. $10 billion for reimbursement of costs supporting DHS's border mission. The entity is the Secretary of Homeland Security.

Then Subtitle B: Sec. 90101: FEHB Improvements. This is about the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The key points are the verification requirements for qualifying life events, fraud risk assessments, a 3-year audit, disenrollment process, and funding for oversight. The amendment to Section 8909 includes $66 million in FY2026 for the FEHB Protection Act.

Sec. 90102: Pandemic Response Accountability Committee. $88 million for FY2026 to support oversight of pandemic funds, including amendments to the CARES Act to extend the funding period to 2034.

Sec. 90103: OMB Appropriation. $100 million for OMB to find budget efficiencies in the executive branch.

Now, I need to make sure each section is summarized in one paragraph, max four sentences. Let me check each one.

Starting with Sec. 90001: $46.55 billion for CBP's border infrastructure, including barriers, roads, sensors, and ground prep, available until 2029. That's one sentence. Wait, the user said at most four sentences. So maybe two sentences: the amount, the entity, the purpose, and the availability.

Wait, the user said "at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences." So each section should be one paragraph, up to four sentences. Let me check the example they provided in the problem statement. The user's instruction says "For every Section ("Sec."), give at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences. Minimum 1 sentence."

So for each section, one paragraph, max four sentences. Let's go through each.

Sec. 90001: The bill appropriates $46.55 billion to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner for fiscal year 2025, available until September 30, 2029, to fund construction, installation, or improvement of border barriers, access roads, detection technology (cameras, sensors), and ground preparation for border operations.

That's one sentence. Wait, but the user said up to four. Maybe split into two sentences for clarity. But the instruction says "at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences," so one paragraph with up to four sentences. So maybe two sentences here.

Wait, the original text says "for fiscal year 2025, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to remain available until September 30, 2029, $46,550,000,000 for necessary expenses relating to the following elements..." So the key points are the amount, the entity (CBP Commissioner), the purpose (border infrastructure elements), and the availability period.

So: Sec. 90001 appropriates $46.55 billion to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner for fiscal year 2025, available until September 30, 2029, to fund construction, installation, or improvement of border barriers, access roads, detection technology (cameras, sensors), and ground preparation for border operations.

That's one sentence. But maybe the user wants more detail. Wait, the original section lists four elements: (1) barriers, (2) access roads, (3) barrier attributes, (4) ground prep. So maybe list those. But the user said "be specific as to parties, entities, and quantities." So the entities are CBP Commissioner, the amount is $46.55 billion, the purposes are the four elements. So the summary should include all four elements. But the user said "concise but not vague," so need to mention the key elements without listing all four. Wait, the instruction says "keep all significant details." So the four elements are significant. But how to fit them concisely.

Wait, the user example in the problem statement says "Be specific as to parties, entities, and quantities. Be concise but not vague, keep all significant details." So I need to mention the four elements. But in a concise way. So maybe: Sec. 90001 allocates $46.55 billion to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner for fiscal year 2025, available until 2029, to construct or improve border barriers, access roads, detection technology (cameras, sensors), and ground preparation for border operations.

That's one sentence. But the user allows up to four sentences. Maybe split into two sentences for clarity. But the instruction says "at most one paragraph," so one paragraph. So one or two sentences. Let's check the other sections.

Sec. 90002: The bill appropriates $4.1 billion for CBP personnel, $2.05263 billion for retention bonuses, $855 million for vehicles, and $5 billion for facilities, all available until 2029, with a restriction prohibiting funds for processing coordinators after October 31, 2028.

Wait, the original says "Personnel.--$4,100,000,000... Retention, hiring, and performance bonuses.--$2,052,630,000... Vehicles.--$855,000,000... Facilities.--$5,000,000,000..." So the total is $4.1B + $2.05263B + $0.855B + $5B = $11.95763B, but the user wants each subsection summarized. Wait, the section is titled "U.S. Customs and Border Protection Personnel, Fleet Vehicles, and Facilities," so the four parts are personnel, retention bonuses, vehicles, facilities. So the summary should list each of those amounts. So the summary would be: Sec. 90002 appropriates $4.1 billion for hiring and training CBP personnel (Border Patrol agents, Office of Field Operations officers, etc.), $2.05263 billion for retention and performance bonuses, $855 million for patrol vehicle repairs and acquisitions, and $5 billion for facility leases, construction, and improvements, all available until September 30, 2029, with a prohibition on using funds for processing coordinators after October 31, 2028.

That's one sentence. But maybe split into two. Wait, the user says "at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences." So one sentence is okay. But let's check if all the key details are included: the amounts, the entities (CBP personnel, etc.), the restriction. Yes, that's covered.

Sec. 90003: The bill appropriates $45 billion to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for fiscal year 2025, available until 2029, to fund single adult alien detention and family residential centers, with detention standards set by the DHS Secretary and a definition of family residential centers as facilities for detained family units, including children not classified as unaccompanied.

Wait, the section says "for single adult alien detention capacity and family residential center capacity." So the $45 billion covers both. The definition of family residential center is included. So the summary should mention the amount, the entity (ICE), the purpose (detention capacity), and the definition. So: Sec. 90003 appropriates $45 billion to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for fiscal year 2025, available until September 30, 2029, to expand single adult and family residential detention capacity, with DHS Secretary setting detention standards and defining family residential centers as facilities for detained family units, including children not classified as unaccompanied aliens.

That's one sentence. But maybe split into two. Wait, the user said "at most four sentences," so one or two is fine.

Sec. 90004: The bill allocates $6.168 billion to CBP for border security technology, including nonintrusive inspection equipment, AI, machine learning, air and marine operations, border surveillance, biometric systems, and drug trafficking interdiction, with a restriction prohibiting untested surveillance towers. The definition of autonomous systems is included, but maybe that's not necessary for the summary. So: Sec. 90004 appropriates $6.168 billion to the CBP Commissioner for fiscal year 2025, available until 2029, to fund nonintrusive inspection equipment, AI-driven border surveillance, air and marine operations, biometric entry-exit systems, and drug trafficking interdiction, while prohibiting untested surveillance towers along the border.

That's one sentence. The restriction is important, so include that.

Sec. 90005: This has two parts. First, the State Homeland Security Grant Programs: $500M for UAS detection, $625M for FIFA World Cup security, $1B for 2028 Olympics, and $450M for Operation Stonegarden. Second, the State Border Security Reinforcement Fund: $10 billion for states to build border walls, etc. So the summary needs to cover both parts. Let's see: Sec. 90005 allocates $500 million for unmanned aircraft system detection, $625 million for 2026 FIFA World Cup security, $1 billion for 2028 Olympics security, and $450 million for Operation Stonegarden under the State Homeland Security Grant Program, plus a $10 billion State Border Security Reinforcement Fund for states to construct border barriers, prepare border ground, and interdict illicit substances, with eligibility retroactive to January 20, 2021.

Wait, the section says "for fiscal year 2025, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to remain available until September 30, 2029, to be administered under the State Homeland Security Grant Program..." So the first part is $500M, $625M, $1B, $450M. The second part is $10 billion for the fund. So the summary should mention both. So: Sec. 90005 provides $500 million for unmanned aircraft system detection, $625 million for 2026 FIFA World Cup security, $1 billion for 2028 Olympics security, and $450 million for Operation Stonegarden under the State Homeland Security Grant Program, alongside a $10 billion State Border Security Reinforcement Fund for states to build border barriers, prepare border infrastructure, and interdict illicit substances, with funds available for activities since January 20, 2021.

That's one sentence. But maybe split into two. Wait, the user allows up to four sentences, but the instruction says "at most one paragraph," so one paragraph. So one or two sentences. Let's check the original text: "In addition to amounts otherwise available, there is appropriated to the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency for fiscal year 2025... $500,000,000 for State and local capabilities to detect, identify, track, or monitor threats from unmanned aircraft systems... $625,000,000 for security and other costs related to the 2026 FIFA World Cup; $1,000,000,000 for security, planning, and other costs related to the 2028 Olympics; and $450,000,000 for the Operation Stonegarden Grant Program." Then the State Border Security Reinforcement Fund is $10 billion. So the summary should include all those numbers and purposes.

Sec. 90006: $300 million to FEMA Administrator for reimbursing state/local law enforcement costs for presidential residence protection, available for costs incurred after July 1, 2024, that exceed typical costs and are tied to Secret Service-designated properties, with 3% for administration. So: Sec. 90006 appropriates $300 million to the FEMA Administrator for fiscal year 2025, available until 2029, to reimburse state and local agencies for extraordinary law enforcement costs protecting presidential residences designated under the Presidential Protection Assistance Act, requiring costs to exceed typical levels and be tied to Secret Service-designated properties, with 3% allocated for administrative expenses.

Sec. 90007: $10 billion to the DHS Secretary for border support cost reimbursements, available until 2029. So: Sec. 90007 allocates $10 billion to the DHS Secretary for fiscal year 2025, available until September 30, 2029, to reimburse costs incurred in supporting DHS's border security mission.

Sec. 90101: FEHB Improvements. The key points are the verification requirements for qualifying life events, fraud risk assessments, a 3-year audit, disenrollment process, and $66 million in FY2026 for oversight. So: Sec. 90101, the FEHB Protection Act of 2025, mandates the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director to implement verification for qualifying life events, conduct fraud risk assessments, and perform a 3-year family eligibility audit, with $66 million in fiscal year 2026 allocated for oversight and audit activities under the FEHB Program.

Sec. 90102: Pandemic Response Accountability Committee gets $88 million for FY2026 to oversee pandemic funds, and amends the CARES Act to extend the funding period to 2034. So: Sec. 90102 appropriates $88 million for fiscal year 2026 to the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee to oversee pandemic-related funds, amending the CARES Act to extend oversight authority through 2034.

Sec. 90103: $100 million to OMB for budget and accounting efficiencies. So: Sec. 90103 appropriates $100 million to the Office of Management and Budget for fiscal year 2025, available until 2029, to identify budget and accounting efficiencies across the executive branch.

Now, I need to check each section to make sure all significant details are included: parties, entities, quantities. Let's verify each.

Sec. 90001: Entity is CBP Commissioner, amount $46.55B, purposes: barriers, access roads, detection tech (cameras, sensors), ground prep. Availability until 2029. Check.

Sec. 90002: Entity is CBP Commissioner, amounts: $4.1B personnel, $2.05263B bonuses, $855M vehicles, $5B facilities. Availability until 2029. Restriction on processing coordinators after 2028. Check.

Sec. 90003: Entity is ICE, amount $45B, purposes: single adult and family detention. DHS Secretary sets standards. Definition of family residential center. Check.

Sec. 90004: Entity is CBP Commissioner, amount $6.168B, purposes: nonintrusive tech, AI, air/marine, surveillance, biometric, drug trafficking. Restriction on untested towers. Check.

Sec. 90005: Entity is FEMA Administrator for the first part, DHS for the fund. Amounts: $500M, $625M, $1B, $450M for grants; $10B for the fund. Purposes: UAS detection, FIFA, Olympics, Stonegarden, border barriers, etc. Eligibility since 2021. Check.

Sec. 90006: Entity is FEMA Administrator, amount $300M, purpose: reimbursement for presidential protection costs, conditions on costs exceeding typical, tied to Secret Service properties, 3% admin. Check.

Sec. 90007: Entity is DHS Secretary, amount $10B, purpose: border support cost reimbursements. Check.

Sec. 90101: Entity is OPM Director, amount $66M in FY2026, purpose: FEHB program oversight, verification, audit. Check.

Sec. 90102: Entity is Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, amount $88M for FY2026, purpose: oversight of pandemic funds, CARES Act amendment to 2034. Check.

Sec. 90103: Entity is OMB, amount $100M, purpose: budget efficiencies. Check.

Now, check if each summary is within one paragraph, max four sentences. Let's count the sentences for each.

Sec. 90001: One sentence. Good.

Sec. 90002: One sentence. Good.

Sec. 90003: One sentence. Good.

Sec. 90004: One sentence. Good.

Sec. 90005: One sentence. Wait, the original summary I wrote for Sec. 90005 was one sentence, but it's a bit long. Let me check: "Sec. 90005 allocates $500 million for unmanned aircraft system detection, $625 million for 2026 FIFA World Cup security, $1 billion for 2028 Olympics security, and $450 million for Operation Stonegarden under the State Homeland Security Grant Program, alongside a $10 billion State Border Security Reinforcement Fund for states to build border barriers, prepare border infrastructure, and interdict illicit substances, with funds available for activities since January 20, 2021." That's one sentence. But maybe split into two for clarity. However, the user said "at most one paragraph," so one sentence is acceptable.

Wait, but the user said "at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences." So one sentence is fine. But let me check if the user's example in the problem statement had multiple sentences. The user provided a bill text, but the example in the problem statement isn't there. So as long as it's one paragraph, even if it's one sentence, that's okay.

Wait, but the user said "Minimum 1 sentence." So each section must have at least one sentence. So one sentence per section is acceptable.

Wait, but let me check if all the key details are included. For Sec. 90005, the first part is under the State Homeland Security Grant Program, and the second part is the State Border Security Reinforcement Fund. The summary mentions both, so that's good.

Now, check for conciseness and specificity. For example, in Sec. 90002, the retention bonuses are for "recruitment bonuses, performance awards, or annual retention bonuses to eligible Border Patrol agents, Office of Field Operations officers, and Air and Marine agents." The summary says "retention and performance bonuses," which is accurate. The user wants specific entities, so mentioning Border Patrol agents, etc., is good, but the summary should be concise. The original instruction says "Be specific as to parties, entities, and quantities." So including the specific roles (Border Patrol agents, etc.) is good, but maybe the summary can be concise by saying "CBP personnel (including Border Patrol agents and Air and Marine agents)" as I did in the draft.

Wait, in my draft for Sec. 90002, I wrote: "Sec. 90002 appropriates $4.1 billion for hiring and training CBP personnel (Border Patrol agents, Office of Field Operations officers, etc.), $2.05263 billion for retention and performance bonuses, $855 million for patrol vehicle repairs and acquisitions, and $5 billion for facility leases, construction, and improvements, all available until September 30, 2029, with a prohibition on using funds for processing coordinators after October 31, 2028."

That's specific: mentions the roles (Border Patrol agents, etc.), the amounts, the purposes. Good.

For Sec. 90003, the definition of family residential center includes "alien children who are not unaccompanied alien children (as defined in section 462(g) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 279(g)))". The summary says "including children not classified as unaccompanied aliens," which is accurate. So that's good.

For Sec. 90004, the restriction is on "surveillance towers along the southwest border and northern border that have not been tested and accepted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to deliver autonomous capabilities." The summary says "prohibiting untested surveillance towers along the border," which is correct. The definition of autonomous is given, but the summary doesn't need to include that, as it's a definition, not a change.

For Sec. 90101, the amendment to Section 8909 includes $66 million in FY2026. The summary mentions "with $66 million in fiscal year 2026 allocated for oversight and audit activities," which is correct.

Now, check the numbers. The bill says $46,550,000,000, which is $46.55 billion. So writing $46.55 billion is correct. Similarly, $4,100,000,000 is $4.1 billion. $2,052,630,000 is $2.05263 billion. $855,000,000 is $855 million. $5,000,000,000 is $5 billion. $45,000,000,000 is $45 billion. $6,168,000,000 is $6.168 billion. $10,000,000,000 is $10 billion. $300,000,000 is $300 million. $88,000,000 is $88 million. $100,000,000 is $100 million. All correct.

Now, check if all sections are covered. The bill has Sec. 90001 to 90007, then 90101 to 90103. So seven sections in Subtitle A and three in Subtitle B. The user listed all of them in the table of contents, so I need to cover all.

Wait, the user's instruction says "for every section 'Sec. XXXX' in the Bill." So all the sections listed in the table of contents. Let me confirm the sections:

Title IX, Subtitle A: Sec. 90001 to 90007.

Subtitle B: Sec. 90101 to 90103.

So total 10 sections. The user provided the table of contents with those sections, so I need to summarize each of the 10 sections.

Wait, the user's problem statement says "Start with Sec. 90001." So I need to list each section in order, from 90001 to 90103.

Wait, the table of contents lists:

TITLE IX--COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY AND GOVERNMENTAL AFFAIRS

                Subtitle A--Homeland Security Provisions

Sec. 90001. Border infrastructure and wall system.
Sec. 90002. U.S. Customs and Border Protection personnel, fleet 
                            vehicles, and facilities.
Sec. 90003. Detention capacity.
Sec. 90004. Border security, technology, and screening.
Sec. 90005. State and local assistance.
Sec. 90006. Presidential residence protection.
Sec. 90007. Department of Homeland Security appropriations for border 
                            support.

              Subtitle B--Governmental Affairs Provisions

Sec. 90101. FEHB improvements.
Sec. 90102. Pandemic Response Accountability Committee.
Sec. 90103. Appropriation for the Office of Management and Budget.

So 10 sections. I need to summarize each of these 10.

Wait, in my earlier draft, I covered all 10. Let me confirm:

Sec. 90001: done.

Sec. 90002: done.

Sec. 90003: done.

Sec. 90004: done.

Sec. 90005: done.

Sec. 90006: done.

Sec. 90007: done.

Sec. 90101: done.

Sec. 90102: done.

Sec. 90103: done.

Yes, all 10.

Now, check if each summary is one paragraph, max four sentences. Each of my summaries is one sentence, which is within the limit.

Wait, but the user said "at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences." So one sentence is acceptable. So all good.

Wait, but let me check if any section needs more than one sentence. For example, Sec. 90005 has two parts (State Homeland Security Grant Programs and State Border Security Reinforcement Fund). The summary combines them into one sentence, which is acceptable. The user said "be specific as to parties, entities, and quantities," so including both parts in one sentence is okay.

Another check: the user mentioned "championed by President Donald Trump, passed by Congress recently." But the bill is dated July 1, 2025, which is in the future. But the user's instruction says "passed by Congress recently," so we can ignore the date discrepancy and just summarize the bill as presented.

Now, let me make sure all the numbers are correctly transcribed. For example, Sec. 90002's retention bonuses are $2,052,630,000, which is $2.05263 billion. In the summary, I wrote $2.05263 billion, which is correct. Sometimes people round, but the user said "be specific," so keeping the exact figure is better.

Wait, the user said "Be specific as to parties, entities, and quantities." So using the exact numbers is important. So $2,052,630,000 should be written as $2.05263 billion. But in the summary, it's better to write it as $2.05263 billion to be concise. Alternatively, $2,052,630,000. But the user probably prefers the concise form. The bill uses the full numbers, but the summary should use the standard billion notation. So $2.05263 billion is correct.

Wait, but the bill says "$2,052,630,000," which is $2.05263 billion. So writing $2.05263 billion is accurate.

Similarly, $6,168,000,000 is $6.168 billion.

Okay, all numbers look correct.

Now, check for any missing entities. For example, in Sec. 90005, the State Border Security Reinforcement Fund is established in the Department of Homeland Security, so the entity is the Secretary of Homeland Security. The summary mentions "for states to build border barriers," which is correct.

In Sec. 90006, the entity is the FEMA Administrator, which is correct.

In Sec. 90101, the entity is the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), which is referred to as "Director" in the section. The summary says "Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director," which is correct.

In Sec. 90102, the entity is the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee.

In Sec. 90103, the entity is the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

All entities are correctly identified.

Now, check if all significant details are included. For example, in Sec. 90003, the detention standards are set by the DHS Secretary, which is included in the summary. The definition of family residential center is mentioned, which is a significant detail.

In Sec. 90004, the restriction on untested surveillance towers is included, which is a key detail.

In Sec. 90005, the eligibility for the State Border Security Reinforcement Fund is retroactive to January 20, 2021, which is included.

In Sec. 90006, the requirement that costs must exceed typical levels and be tied to Secret Service-designated properties is included.

In Sec. 90101, the $66 million in FY2026 is included.

All significant details seem to be covered.

I think that's all. Now, format the response as per the user's instruction: start with Sec. 90001, each section in order, one paragraph per section, max four sentences, specific on parties, entities, quantities.

Wait, the user said "For every Section ("Sec."), give at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences. Minimum 1 sentence."

So the response should list each section with its summary, starting from Sec. 90001.

Let me write them out as per the order in the table of contents.
</think>
