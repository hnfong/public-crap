Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a very detailed bill text and wants a summary of each section starting from Sec. 10101. They specified that for each section, I should give at most one paragraph with up to four sentences, be specific about parties, entities, and quantities, and keep it concise but not vague.

First, I need to parse the bill structure. The bill is divided into Titles, Subtitles, and Sections. The user mentioned starting with Sec. 10101, so I'll begin there. Let me check the bill text to find Sec. 10101.

Looking at the provided text, Sec. 10101 is under Title I, Subtitle A--Nutrition. The section is titled "RE-EVALUATION OF THRIFTY FOOD PLAN." The amendment replaces subsection (u) of Section 3 of the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008. The key points here are the changes to the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP), including the re-evaluation of market baskets starting October 1, 2027, and cost neutrality. The user wants specific details, so I need to note the dates, the cost adjustment based on CPI, and the household size ratios.

Wait, the original section (u) is being amended. The new subsection (u) has several parts. Let me break it down. Part (1) defines the TFP as the diet for a 4-person family based on the 2021 report, with conditions on market basket changes and cost adjustments. Part (2) gives household size ratios, like 30% for 1-person, 55% for 2-person, etc. Part (3) covers cost adjustments for Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, and Virgin Islands, and annual CPI adjustments starting October 1, 2025. Part (4) is the re-evaluation of market baskets after October 1, 2027, with a cost neutrality clause.

So for Sec. 10101, the main changes are the re-evaluation of market baskets starting in 2027, the annual CPI adjustment, and the household size ratios. I need to mention the Department of Agriculture as the entity responsible, the specific dates (October 1, 2027, October 1, 2025), and the cost neutrality requirement. Also, the household ratios are specific percentages. Let me check if there are any other details. The conforming amendments in (b) refer to changing references from section 3(u)(4) to 3(u)(3), but the user asked for the main changes in the section, so maybe just mention the key points in (a).

Wait, the user said "for every Section ('Sec.'), give at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences." So I need to summarize each section concisely. Let me make sure I don't include the conforming amendments unless they're significant. The main change here is the re-evaluation of the TFP market baskets and the cost adjustments.

Moving to Sec. 10102: Modifications to SNAP work requirements for able-bodied adults. The key changes here are amending Section 6(o) of the Food and Nutrition Act. They're striking paragraph (3) and inserting a new one with exceptions like age, medical certification, parents with children under 14, etc. Also, standardizing enforcement with noncontiguous states and a waiver for them. The noncontiguous states include Alaska, Hawaii, but exclude Guam and Virgin Islands. The exemption for noncontiguous states expires December 31, 2028. Need to mention the specific exceptions, the definition of noncontiguous states, and the exemption duration.

Sec. 10103: Availability of standard utility allowances based on receipt of energy assistance. The amendment adds "with an elderly or disabled member" after "households" in Section 5(e)(6)(C)(iv)(I). Then, in Section 5(k)(4), it modifies the language to specify "without an elderly or disabled member" and "with an elderly or disabled member." So the change is about who qualifies for the utility allowances based on energy assistance. The entities here are the Food and Nutrition Act sections, and the key is the addition of the elderly/disabled condition.

Sec. 10104: Restrictions on internet expenses. The amendment adds a new subsection (E) stating that service fees for internet connection can't be used in computing excess shelter expense deductions. So the main point is prohibiting internet service fees from being included in shelter expense calculations for SNAP.

Sec. 10105: Matching funds requirements. The amendment to Section 4(a) introduces a state quality control incentive based on payment error rates. The Federal share varies depending on the error rate: less than 6% means 100% Federal share, 6-8% is 95%, 8-10% is 90%, and 10%+ is 85%. There's also a delayed implementation for states with high error rates. The key points are the error rate thresholds, the corresponding Federal shares, and the delayed implementation for states with error rates multiplied by 1.5 above 20%.

Sec. 10106: Administrative cost sharing. The amendment changes the administrative cost sharing from 50% through 2026 to 25% starting in 2027. So the entity is the Food and Nutrition Act, Section 16(a), and the change is from 50% to 25% for fiscal years 2027 and beyond.

Sec. 10107: National Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program. The amendment changes the funding period from "fiscal year 2016 and each subsequent fiscal year" to "fiscal years 2016 through 2025." So the program's funding is now capped at 2025 instead of ongoing.

Sec. 10108: Alien SNAP eligibility. The amendment revises Section 6(f) to restrict eligibility to specific categories: U.S. residents, citizens/nationals, lawful permanent residents (excluding temporary visitors), Cuban/Haitian entrants, and Compact of Free Association individuals. The key is the updated eligibility criteria, specifying the excluded groups like tourists and students.

Now, moving to Subtitle B--Forestry, Sec. 10201: Rescission of amounts for forestry. The bill rescinds unobligated balances from specific provisions of Public Law 117-169, including sections 23001(a) paragraphs 3-4, 23002(a) paragraphs 1-4, 23003(a)(2), and 23005. The entities here are the unobligated balances from those sections, and the rescission is effective immediately.

Subtitle C--Commodities starts with Sec. 10301: Effective Reference Price; Reference Price. The amendment changes the effective reference price from 85 to 88 for the 2025 crop year. The reference price for various commodities is set with specific dollar amounts per bushel or hundredweight. Also, the reference price increases by 0.5% annually starting 2031, with a cap at 113% of the initial reference price. Need to list the key commodities and their prices, like wheat at $6.35/bushel, corn at $4.10, etc.

Sec. 10302: Base Acres. This section adds 30 million additional base acres, allocated based on 5-year average planting data from 2019-2023. The eligibility criteria involve comparing the 5-year average of planted acres to the current base acres. The allocation is proportional to the covered commodities planted during those years. The Secretary must apply a pro-rata reduction if total eligible acres exceed 30 million. Key points: 30 million additional base acres, 2019-2023 data, pro-rata reduction.

Sec. 10303: Producer Election. Amends Section 1115 to change the election period from 2023 to 2031, and adds a provision for the 2025 crop year to take the higher of Price Loss Coverage or Agriculture Risk Coverage payments. The key is the change in the election year and the 2025 crop year provision.

Sec. 10304: Price Loss Coverage. Amends Section 1116 to update the reference years from 2023 to 2031, and changes the benchmark revenue period from 2012-2016 to 2017-2021. So the main changes are the year adjustments for the reference periods.

Sec. 10305: Agriculture Risk Coverage. Similar to 10304, updates the reference years to 2031 and adjusts the benchmark revenue percentages. The key is the change from 2023 to 2031 in the subsections and the benchmark revenue periods.

Sec. 10306: Equitable Treatment of Certain Entities. Amends the Food Security Act to define "qualified pass-through entity" to include partnerships, S corporations, LLCs, and joint ventures. The changes replace "joint ventures and general partnerships" with "qualified pass-through entities" in various sections. The entities affected are these pass-through entities, and the key is the new definition.

Sec. 10307: Payment Limitations. Increases the payment limit from $125,000 to $155,000, with annual inflation adjustments based on CPI. So the new limit is $155,000, and it's adjusted annually.

Sec. 10308: Adjusted Gross Income Limitation. Adds an exception for certain operations where 75% of gross income comes from farming, ranching, or silviculture activities. The exception includes payments under certain programs, and the definition of farming activities is expanded. Key points: 75% threshold, exception for specific payments.

Sec. 10309: Marketing Loans. Updates loan rates for various commodities for the 2026-2031 crop years. For example, wheat loan rate is $3.72/bushel, corn $2.42, etc. Also, changes to cotton storage costs and loan deficiency payments. Need to list the key loan rates.

Sec. 10310: Repayment of Marketing Loans. Amends repayment terms, including refund for upland cotton based on the lowest world market price. The key is the refund calculation and the adjustment for extra long staple cotton.

Sec. 10311: Economic Adjustment Assistance for Textile Mills. Changes the assistance value from 3 cents per pound (2013-2025) to 5 cents per pound starting 2025. So the rate increases from 3 to 5 cents.

Sec. 10312: Sugar Program Updates. Modifies loan rates for raw cane sugar to $24.00 per pound for 2025-2031, and adjusts storage rates. Also, adds a study on refined sugar imports. Key points: $24.00 per pound, storage rates of 34 cents/hundredweight for refined sugar, 27 for raw.

Sec. 10313: Dairy Policy Updates. Increases the production history threshold from 5 million to 6 million pounds, adjusts premium tiers, and extends the program to 2031. The main changes are the 6 million figure and the extension.

Sec. 10314: Implementation. Allocates $50 million for implementing the subtitle, with specific allocations like $5 million for paragraphs (3)-(4), $3 million for certain activities, etc.

Subtitle D--Disaster Assistance Programs, Sec. 10401: Supplemental Agricultural Disaster Assistance. Changes livestock indemnity payments to 100% for predation and 75% for weather/disease, adds unborn livestock death losses with a payment rate up to 85%, and modifies the Livestock Forage Disaster Program to 2 monthly payments. Key points: payment rates, unborn livestock details.

Subtitle E--Crop Insurance, Sec. 10501: Beginning Farmer and Rancher Benefit. Increases the definition of beginning farmer from 5 to 10 years, adds additional premium assistance (5% for first two years, 3% third, 1% fourth). So the key is the 10-year definition and the percentage points.

Sec. 10502: Area-Based Crop Insurance Coverage and Affordability. Increases coverage levels to 85% for individual, 90% for aggregated, 95% for area-based. Also, premium subsidy increases from 65% to 80%. So the coverage percentages and the subsidy rate change.

Sec. 10503: Administrative and Operating Expense Adjustments. Adds new provisions for additional expenses (6% of net book premium), specialty crops (17% minimum reimbursement), and A&O inflation adjustment. Key points: 6% subsidy, 17% for specialty crops.

Sec. 10504: Premium Support. Increases premium support percentages across the board (e.g., 64% to 69% for certain coverage levels). So the specific percentages being raised.

Sec. 10505: Program Compliance and Integrity. Increases the annual funding for compliance from $4 million to $6 million for fiscal years 2026+. So the funding amount change.

Sec. 10506: Reviews, Compliance, and Integrity. Adjusts the annual funding for reviews from $10 million starting 2026. The previous was $10 million for 2014-2025, now $10 million for 2026+.

Sec. 10507: Poultry Insurance Pilot Program. Establishes a pilot program for index-based insurance for poultry growers, to be conducted in top poultry-producing states, with approval within 2 years. Key points: pilot program, 2-year approval deadline.

Subtitle F--Additional Investments in Rural America, Sec. 10601: Conservation. Increases funding for conservation programs from $625 million in 2026 to $700 million by 2030. Also, adjusts other funding levels. So the specific annual amounts.

Sec. 10602: Supplemental Agricultural Trade Promotion Program. Allocates $285 million for fiscal year 2027 and beyond. So the funding amount and period.

Sec. 10603: Nutrition. Extends the funding period for the Emergency Food Assistance Act from 2024 to 2031. So the change from 2024 to 2031.

Sec. 10604: Research. Various research programs get extended funding through 2031, with specific amounts like $37 million for the Foundation, $60 million for 1890 scholarships, etc.

Sec. 10605: Energy. Extends the funding period for energy programs from 2024 to 2031.

Sec. 10606: Horticulture. Increases funding for plant pest management, specialty crop grants, and organic initiatives. For example, $90 million for fiscal year 2026 instead of $75 million.

Sec. 10607: Miscellaneous. Covers various programs like animal disease prevention, sheep grants, and trust funds, with specific funding amounts for fiscal years 2026-2031.

Now, I need to go through each section and summarize in one paragraph, max four sentences, specific on parties, entities, quantities. Let me check each one again to ensure I have the key details.

Starting with Sec. 10101: The main points are the re-evaluation of the Thrifty Food Plan market baskets starting October 1, 2027, cost adjustments based on CPI annually from October 1, 2025, and the household size ratios. The Department of Agriculture is the entity. So the summary should mention those dates, the cost neutrality clause, and the household percentages.

Wait, the user said "Be specific as to parties, entities, and quantities." So for Sec. 10101, the entity is the Department of Agriculture, the quantities are the household ratios (30%, 55%, etc.), the dates (Oct 1, 2025, 2027), and the cost neutrality.

Let me draft that: "Sec. 10101 redefines the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) under the Food and Nutrition Act, requiring the Department of Agriculture to re-evaluate market baskets no earlier than October 1, 2027, with cost neutrality to prevent increases. It mandates annual CPI-based cost adjustments starting October 1, 2025, and establishes household size ratios (e.g., 30% for 1-person, 55% for 2-person, up to 200% for 9+ persons). The TFP must reflect current food prices, consumption patterns, and dietary guidance, with Hawaii and Alaska receiving cost adjustments."

Wait, the user said "at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences." So that's four sentences. Let me check if all key points are included. The re-evaluation date, cost neutrality, CPI adjustment, household ratios, and the specific regions (Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, Virgin Islands). Wait, the original text mentions Hawaii and rural/urban Alaska, and Guam/Virgin Islands with a cap. So I should include that. Let me adjust: "Sec. 10101 redefines the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) under the Food and Nutrition Act, requiring the Department of Agriculture to re-evaluate market baskets no earlier than October 1, 2027, with cost neutrality to prevent increases. It mandates annual CPI-based cost adjustments starting October 1, 2025, for Hawaii, Alaska (urban/rural), and Guam/Virgin Islands (capped at 50 states' cost). Household size ratios are standardized (e.g., 30% for 1-person, 55% for 2-person, 200% max for 9+ persons), and the TFP must reflect current food prices and dietary guidance."

Wait, the original says "the cost of the thrifty food plan may only be adjusted in accordance with this subsection" and the adjustment is based on CPI. Also, the cost adjustments for Hawaii and Alaska, and Guam/Virgin Islands not exceeding 50 states' cost. So the Guam/Virgin Islands cap is important. Let me make sure to include that. So the summary should mention the cap for Guam and Virgin Islands.

Moving to Sec. 10102: The key changes are the new exceptions for SNAP work requirements, including age, medical certification, parents with young children, and the waiver for noncontiguous states (Alaska, Hawaii, but not Guam/Virgin Islands) with an exemption until Dec 31, 2028. The noncontiguous states are defined as non-48 states or DC, excluding Guam/Virgin Islands. So the summary should mention the exceptions, the definition of noncontiguous states, and the exemption period.

"Sec. 10102 modifies SNAP work requirements by adding exceptions for individuals under 18, over 65, medically unfit, parents of children under 14, pregnant women, and certain Native Americans. It standardizes enforcement for noncontiguous states (Alaska, Hawaii, excluding Guam/Virgin Islands), allowing exemptions until December 31, 2028, if states demonstrate good faith efforts to comply. States must submit quarterly progress reports and detailed compliance plans, with exemptions terminating if states fail to meet reporting requirements or demonstrate insufficient progress."

Wait, the user wants specific quantities. The exemption is until Dec 31, 2028, and the reporting is quarterly. So that's included. The key entities are the Food and Nutrition Act, the Secretary, and the states.

Sec. 10103: The amendment adds "with an elderly or disabled member" to the utility allowance eligibility. So the summary should state that households with elderly/disabled members now qualify for standard utility allowances based on energy assistance, and the modification to the sections. Wait, the original text says "inserting 'with an elderly or disabled member' after 'households'" in Section 5(e)(6)(C)(iv)(I), and in Section 5(k)(4), modifying to "without an elderly or disabled member" and "with an elderly or disabled member." So the change is that households with elderly/disabled members get the standard utility allowance based on energy assistance, while those without get a different treatment. So the summary should mention the specific sections and the change in eligibility.

"Sec. 10103 amends the Food and Nutrition Act to require standard utility allowances for households with elderly or disabled members receiving energy assistance, replacing prior language that excluded such households. It revises Section 5(e)(6)(C)(iv)(I) to include 'with an elderly or disabled member' after 'households' and modifies Section 5(k)(4) to specify that households without such members are subject to different rules. This change ensures energy assistance recipients with elderly or disabled members qualify for standard utility allowances, aligning with existing SNAP provisions."

Wait, the user wants specific quantities. But this section doesn't have quantities, just eligibility changes. So the summary should focus on the eligibility change. The key is the addition of "with an elderly or disabled member" in the relevant sections.

Sec. 10104: Restrictions on internet expenses. The amendment adds that internet service fees cannot be used in computing excess shelter expense deductions. So the summary is straightforward.

"Sec. 10104 prohibits using internet service fees in calculating excess shelter expense deductions under the Food and Nutrition Act, amending Section 5(e)(6) to explicitly exclude such fees. This change ensures SNAP benefits are not reduced based on internet costs, aligning with prior policy to exclude non-shelter expenses from deductions."

Sec. 10105: Matching funds requirements. The key is the Federal share based on payment error rates: <6% error rate = 100% Federal share, 6-8% = 95%, 8-10% = 90%, 10%+ = 85%. Also, delayed implementation for states with high error rates (error rate *1.5 ≥20% gets delayed to 2029 or 2030). So the summary needs to include the error rate thresholds, the corresponding Federal shares, and the delayed implementation dates.

"Sec. 10105 establishes a state quality control incentive under the Food and Nutrition Act, linking Federal share funding to payment error rates: <6% error rate = 100% Federal share, 6–8% = 95%, 8–10% = 90%, and ≥10% = 85%. States with error rates multiplied by 1.5 ≥20% face delayed implementation (2029 for 2025 rates, 2030 for 2026 rates). The Secretary must calculate State shares using error rates from prior fiscal years, with annual adjustments for fiscal years 2029 onward."

Wait, the original says for fiscal year 2028, states can elect 2025 or 2026 error rates, and for 2029+, use the third prior fiscal year. But the user wants conciseness, so maybe just mention the error rate thresholds and the delayed implementation for high-error states.

Sec. 10106: Administrative cost sharing. The amendment changes the cost sharing from 50% through 2026 to 25% for 2027 and beyond. So the summary is simple.

"Sec. 10106 reduces administrative cost sharing under the Food and Nutrition Act from 50% (through fiscal year 2026) to 25% (fiscal years 2027 and later), amending Section 16(a) to reflect this change. This adjustment shifts more costs to states for administrative expenses, impacting state funding allocations for SNAP operations."

Sec. 10107: National Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program. The funding period changes from "fiscal year 2016 and each subsequent fiscal year" to "fiscal years 2016 through 2025." So the program ends in 2025.

"Sec. 10107 terminates the National Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program funding after fiscal year 2025, revising the Food and Nutrition Act to limit support to fiscal years 2016–2025. Previously, funding was ongoing, but the amendment caps it at 2025, ending annual appropriations for this initiative."

Sec. 10108: Alien SNAP eligibility. The amendment restricts eligibility to specific categories: U.S. residents, citizens/nationals, lawful permanent residents (excluding temporary visitors), Cuban/Haitian entrants, and Compact of Free Association individuals. The key is the exclusion of temporary visitors, tourists, diplomats, students.

"Sec. 10108 revises SNAP alien eligibility to require individuals to be U.S. residents, citizens/nationals, lawful permanent residents (excluding temporary visitors, tourists, diplomats, and students), Cuban/Haitian entrants, or Compact of Free Association members. It explicitly excludes temporary foreign nationals, aligning with prior policy but clarifying prohibited categories to prevent misuse of benefits."

Now, moving to Subtitle B, Sec. 10201: Rescission of forestry funds. The bill rescinds unobligated balances from specific sections of Public Law 117-169. The key is the sections being rescinded: 23001(a) paragraphs 3-4, 23002(a) paragraphs 1-4, 23003(a)(2), and 23005.

"Sec. 10201 rescinds unobligated balances from Public Law 117-169, specifically provisions in sections 23001(a) paragraphs 3–4, 23002(a) paragraphs 1–4, 23003(a)(2), and 23005. These rescissions apply to forestry-related appropriations, redirecting funds previously allocated for forestry programs. The amendment eliminates unused budget authority, reducing future spending in these areas without new funding."

Subtitle C, Sec. 10301: Effective Reference Price; Reference Price. The reference price for commodities is set with specific values, and the effective reference price increases from 85 to 88 for 2025. The reference prices for various commodities are listed, and the annual increase of 0.5% starting 2031 with a 113% cap.

"Sec. 10301 sets the effective reference price for 2025 crop year at 88 (from 85) and establishes reference prices for commodities, including wheat at $6.35/bushel, corn at $4.10/bushel, and soybeans at $10.00/bushel. Reference prices for 2031 and beyond increase annually by 0.5%, capped at 113% of initial values. This amendment adjusts baseline pricing for crop insurance and subsidy programs under the Agricultural Act of 2014."

Wait, the original says "effective beginning with the 2025 crop year, subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), the term 'reference price'...". So the reference price is set for 2025, and then increases from 2031. The effective reference price is 88 for 2025. So the summary should mention the 88 for 2025, the specific commodity prices, and the 0.5% annual increase starting 2031.

Sec. 10302: Base Acres. Adds 30 million additional base acres, allocated based on 5-year average planting data from 2019-2023. The eligibility is based on comparing the 5-year average to current base acres, with a pro-rata reduction if total exceeds 30 million.

"Sec. 10302 allocates an additional 30 million base acres under the Agricultural Act of 2014, based on 5-year average planting data (2019–2023) for covered commodities. Eligible farms must have a 5-year average exceeding current base acres, with allocations proportional to commodity planting history. The Secretary applies a pro-rata reduction if total eligible acres exceed 30 million, and payment yields for 2026+ are set to the farm's existing yield or county average."

Sec. 10303: Producer Election. Changes the election period from 2023 to 2031, and adds a provision for 2025 crop year to take the higher of Price Loss Coverage or Agriculture Risk Coverage.

"Sec. 10303 amends producer election periods under the Agricultural Act of 2014, extending the deadline to 2031 for certain coverage elections. It mandates that for the 2025 crop year, producers receive the higher of Price Loss Coverage or Agriculture Risk Coverage payments on a commodity-by-commodity basis. This change simplifies payment options and ensures producers benefit from the most advantageous coverage."

Sec. 10304: Price Loss Coverage. Updates reference years from 2023 to 2031 and changes the benchmark revenue period from 2012-2016 to 2017-2021.

"Sec. 10304 updates Price Loss Coverage (PLC) provisions under the Agricultural Act of 2014, revising reference years from 2023 to 2031 and adjusting benchmark revenue periods from 2012–2016 to 2017–2021. The amendment aligns PLC calculations with more recent market data, affecting payment determinations for covered commodities like corn and soybeans."

Sec. 10305: Agriculture Risk Coverage. Similar to 10304, updates reference years and benchmark revenue.

"Sec. 10305 revises Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) to extend reference years to 2031 and adjust benchmark revenue periods from 2012–2016 to 2017–2021. It increases the benchmark revenue calculation to 90% for 2025–2031 crop years, enhancing coverage stability for producers during market fluctuations."

Wait, the original says "for each of the 2014 through 2024 crop years and 90 percent of the benchmark revenue for each of the 2025 through 2031 crop years." So the benchmark revenue is 90% for 2025-2031. So the summary should mention that.

Sec. 10306: Equitable Treatment of Certain Entities. Defines "qualified pass-through entity" to include partnerships, S corps, LLCs, and joint ventures, replacing previous terms.

"Sec. 10306 redefines 'qualified pass-through entity' under the Food Security Act to include partnerships, S corporations, limited liability companies, and joint ventures, replacing outdated terms. This change ensures equitable treatment of these entities in farm program payments, aligning with modern business structures and eliminating exclusions for certain pass-through entities."

Sec. 10307: Payment Limitations. Increases the payment limit from $125,000 to $155,000, with annual CPI adjustments.

"Sec. 10307 raises the payment limitation for farm programs from $125,000 to $155,000, with annual inflation adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index. This adjustment applies to both individual and entity payment limits under the Food Security Act, increasing the cap to reflect rising costs and ensuring program sustainability."

Sec. 10308: Adjusted Gross Income Limitation. Adds an exception for operations where 75% of gross income comes from farming, ranching, or silviculture.

"Sec. 10308 exempts operations where ≥75% of gross income derives from farming, ranching, or silviculture activities from adjusted gross income (AGI) limitations. This exception includes payments under certain programs, expanding eligibility for agricultural entities while maintaining fiscal responsibility under the Food Security Act."

Sec. 10309: Marketing Loans. Updates loan rates for 2026-2031, e.g., wheat at $3.72/bushel, corn at $2.42, etc.

"Sec. 10309 sets new marketing loan rates for 2026–2031 crop years, including wheat at $3.72/bushel, corn at $2.42/bushel, soybeans at $6.82/bushel, and peanuts at $390/ton. It also modifies cotton storage costs to $4.90 in California/Arizona and $3.00 elsewhere, enhancing support for key agricultural commodities."

Sec. 10310: Repayment of Marketing Loans. Amends repayment terms, including refunds for upland cotton based on the lowest world market price.

"Sec. 10310 revises marketing loan repayment rules, requiring refunds for upland cotton if the world market price drops below the repayment rate within 30 days. It also adjusts extra long staple cotton pricing to account for market costs, ensuring fair repayment terms and reducing government stockpiles."

Sec. 10311: Economic Adjustment Assistance for Textile Mills. Increases assistance from 3 cents to 5 cents per pound starting 2025.

"Sec. 10311 raises economic adjustment assistance for textile mills from 3 cents to 5 cents per pound, effective August 1, 2025. This increase supports the textile industry by providing higher subsidies for cotton processing, aligning with broader agricultural trade policies."

Sec. 10312: Sugar Program Updates. Sets raw cane sugar loan rate at $24.00 per pound for 2025–2031, adjusts storage rates, and mandates a study on refined sugar imports.

"Sec. 10312 establishes a $24.00 per pound loan rate for raw cane sugar (2025–2031), increases storage rates to 34 cents/hundredweight for refined sugar, and requires a study on refined sugar import standards. The study examines definitions, packaging, and transportation requirements to protect the domestic sugar industry."

Sec. 10313: Dairy Policy Updates. Increases production history threshold from 5 million to 6 million pounds, adjusts premium tiers, and extends the program to 2031.

"Sec. 10313 raises the dairy margin coverage production history threshold from 5 million to 6 million pounds, increases premium tiers to $6 million, and extends the program through 2031. These changes enhance dairy program accessibility and financial support for participating operations."

Sec. 10314: Implementation. Allocates $50 million for implementing the subtitle, with specific allocations.

Now, I need to check each summary to ensure they're within the sentence limit, specific, and include all significant details. Let me verify a few more.

For Sec. 10101: The original text mentions "the cost of the thrifty food plan may only be adjusted in accordance with this subsection" and the annual CPI adjustment. The summary should include that the cost is adjusted based on CPI, and the re-evaluation is cost-neutral. The household ratios are specific, so including those is important.

Wait, the user said "Be specific as to parties, entities, and quantities." So for Sec. 10101, the entity is the Department of Agriculture, the quantities are the household ratios (30%, 55%, etc.), the dates (Oct 1, 2025, 2027), and the cost neutrality. The summary I drafted includes those, so that's good.

For Sec. 10102, the key entities are the Secretary, states, and the noncontiguous states. The exemption period is until Dec 31, 2028. The summary mentions that, so it's covered.

Sec. 10103: The entity is the Food and Nutrition Act, the change is adding "with an elderly or disabled member" to the eligibility. The summary states that, so it's correct.

Sec. 10104: The entity is the Food and Nutrition Act, the change is prohibiting internet fees in shelter expense calculations. The summary is concise.

Sec. 10105: The Federal share percentages and the delayed implementation for high-error states. The summary includes the error rate thresholds and the delayed years (2029, 2030), so that's good.

Sec. 10106: The change from 50% to 25% for administrative cost sharing. The summary mentions that.

Sec. 10107: The funding period change from ongoing to 2025. The summary states that.

Sec. 10108: The eligibility categories, specifically excluding temporary visitors, etc. The summary includes that.

I think all sections are covered. Now, I need to make sure each summary is one paragraph, max four sentences. Let me check a couple.

Sec. 10101: The draft has four sentences. Good.

Sec. 10102: Four sentences. Good.

Sec. 10103: Three sentences. Okay.

Sec. 10104: Two sentences. Okay.

Sec. 10105: Four sentences. Okay.

Looks good. Now, I'll compile all the summaries in order, starting from Sec. 10101.
</think>

Sec. 10101 redefines the Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) under the Food and Nutrition Act, requiring the Department of Agriculture to re-evaluate market baskets no earlier than October 1, 2027, with cost neutrality to prevent increases. It mandates annual Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based cost adjustments starting October 1, 2025, for Hawaii, Alaska (urban/rural), and Guam/Virgin Islands (capped at 50 states’ cost). Household size ratios are standardized (e.g., 30% for 1-person, 55% for 2-person, 200% max for 9+ persons), and the TFP must reflect current food prices and dietary guidance.  

Sec. 10102 modifies SNAP work requirements by adding exceptions for individuals under 18, over 65, medically unfit, parents of children under 14, pregnant women, and certain Native Americans. It standardizes enforcement for noncontiguous states (Alaska, Hawaii, excluding Guam/Virgin Islands), allowing exemptions until December 31, 2028, if states demonstrate good faith efforts. States must submit quarterly progress reports and detailed compliance plans, with exemptions terminating for noncompliance.  

Sec. 10103 amends the Food and Nutrition Act to require standard utility allowances for households with elderly or disabled members receiving energy assistance, replacing prior exclusions. It revises Section 5(e)(6)(C)(iv)(I) to include "with an elderly or disabled member" after "households" and modifies Section 5(k)(4) to specify different rules for households without such members. This ensures energy assistance recipients with elderly/disabled members qualify for standard utility allowances.  

Sec. 10104 prohibits using internet service fees in calculating excess shelter expense deductions under the Food and Nutrition Act, amending Section 5(e)(6) to explicitly exclude such fees. This change aligns SNAP policy to exclude non-shelter expenses from deductions, preventing benefit reductions for internet costs.  

Sec. 10105 establishes a state quality control incentive linking Federal share funding to payment error rates: <6% error rate = 100% Federal share, 6–8% = 95%, 8–10% = 90%, ≥10% = 85%. States with error rates ×1.5 ≥20% face delayed implementation (2029 for 2025 rates, 2030 for 2026 rates), with State shares calculated using prior fiscal year data.  

Sec. 10106 reduces administrative cost sharing under the Food and Nutrition Act from 50% (through fiscal year 2026) to 25% (fiscal years 2027 and later), amending Section 16(a) to reflect this shift. This change increases state cost responsibility for SNAP administrative expenses, impacting state budget allocations.  

Sec. 10107 terminates the National Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program funding after fiscal year 2025, revising the Food and Nutrition Act to cap support at fiscal years 2016–2025. Previously ongoing funding is now limited, ending annual appropriations for this initiative.  

Sec. 10108 revises SNAP alien eligibility to require individuals to be U.S. residents, citizens/nationals, lawful permanent residents (excluding temporary visitors, tourists, diplomats, and students), Cuban/Haitian entrants, or Compact of Free Association members. It explicitly excludes temporary foreign nationals, clarifying prohibited categories to prevent benefit misuse.  

Sec. 10201 rescinds unobligated balances from Public Law 117-169, specifically sections 23001(a) paragraphs 3–4, 23002(a) paragraphs 1–4, 23003(a)(2), and 23005. These rescissions eliminate unused forestry-related appropriations, redirecting funds from prior forestry programs.  

Sec. 10301 sets the effective reference price for 2025 crop year at 88 (from 85) and establishes reference prices for commodities: wheat at $6.35/bushel, corn at $4.10/bushel, soybeans at $10.00/bushel. Reference prices for 2031+ increase annually by 0.5%, capped at 113% of initial values.  

Sec. 10302 allocates 30 million additional base acres under the Agricultural Act of 2014, based on 5-year average planting data (2019–2023) for covered commodities. Eligible farms must exceed current base acres, with allocations proportional to commodity planting history and a pro-rata reduction if total exceeds 30 million.  

Sec. 10303 amends producer election periods to 2031 and mandates the higher of Price Loss Coverage or Agriculture Risk Coverage payments for the 2025 crop year. This simplifies payment options, ensuring producers benefit from the most advantageous coverage.  

Sec. 10304 updates Price Loss Coverage (PLC) reference years from 2023 to 2031 and adjusts benchmark revenue periods from 2012–2016 to 2017–2021. This aligns PLC calculations with recent market data, affecting payments for commodities like corn and soybeans.  

Sec. 10305 revises Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) to extend reference years to 2031 and adjust benchmark revenue to 90% for 2025–2031 crop years. This enhances coverage stability, increasing benchmark revenue calculations for producer support.  

Sec. 10306 redefines "qualified pass-through entity" to include partnerships, S corporations, LLCs, and joint ventures, replacing outdated terms. This ensures equitable treatment of these entities in farm program payments under the Food Security Act.  

Sec. 10307 raises the payment limitation for farm programs from $125,000 to $155,000, with annual inflation adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index. This adjustment applies to both individual and entity payment limits under the Food Security Act.  

Sec. 10308 exempts operations with ≥75% gross income from farming, ranching, or silviculture activities from adjusted gross income (AGI) limitations. This exception includes payments under certain programs, expanding eligibility for agricultural entities.  

Sec. 10309 sets new marketing loan rates for 2026–2031: wheat at $3.72/bushel, corn at $2.42/bushel, soybeans at $6.82/bushel, peanuts at $390/ton. It also modifies cotton storage costs to $4.90 (California/Arizona) and $3.00 (other states).  

Sec. 10310 revises marketing loan repayment rules, requiring refunds for upland cotton if world market prices drop below repayment rates within 30 days. It adjusts extra long staple cotton pricing to account for market costs, reducing government stockpiles.  

Sec. 10311 raises economic adjustment assistance for textile mills from 3 cents to 5 cents per pound, effective August 1, 2025. This increase supports the textile industry by providing higher subsidies for cotton processing.  

Sec. 10312 establishes a $24.00 per pound loan rate for raw cane sugar (2025–2031), increases storage rates to 34 cents/hundredweight for refined sugar, and mandates a study on refined sugar import standards. The study examines packaging, transportation, and definitions to protect the domestic sugar industry.  

Sec. 10313 raises the dairy margin coverage production history threshold from 5 million to 6 million pounds, increases premium tiers to $6 million, and extends the program through 2031. These changes enhance dairy program accessibility and financial support.  

Sec. 10314 allocates $50 million for implementing Title I, Subtitle C, including $5 million for compliance, $9 million for dairy surveys, and $1 million for a sugar study. This funding ensures effective rollout of amended agricultural programs under the Agricultural Act of 2014.  

Sec. 10401 increases livestock indemnity payments to 100% for predation and 75% for weather/disease, adds unborn livestock death loss payments at up to 85% of the lowest weight class rate, and modifies the Livestock Forage Disaster Program to provide 2 monthly payments. These changes enhance disaster relief for farmers facing livestock losses.  

Sec. 10501 extends the "beginning farmer" definition from 5 to 10 years and adds premium assistance: 5 percentage points for first two reinsurance years, 3 for the third, and 1 for the fourth. This support bolsters new entrants into agriculture through enhanced financial assistance.  

Sec. 10502 raises crop insurance coverage levels to 85% (individual), 90% (aggregated), and 95% (area-based), while increasing premium subsidies from 65% to 80%. These changes improve affordability and accessibility of crop insurance for farmers.  

Sec. 10503 introduces a 6% administrative and operating expense subsidy for eligible contracts, a 17% minimum reimbursement for specialty crops, and an annual A&O inflation adjustment. These provisions reduce insurer costs and support specialty crop producers.  

Sec. 10504 raises premium support rates for crop insurance, increasing coverage levels from 64% to 69% (individual yield), 59% to 64% (revenue), and 38% to 41% (revenue). These adjustments enhance financial support for farmers purchasing crop insurance.  

Sec. 10505 increases annual funding for program compliance and integrity from $4 million (2009–2025) to $6 million (2026 onward). This strengthens oversight of crop insurance and farm programs under the Federal Crop Insurance Act.  

Sec. 10506 sets annual funding for program reviews at $10 million for fiscal years 2026 and beyond, replacing prior funding levels for 2014–2025. This ensures consistent oversight and evaluation of agricultural programs.  

Sec. 10507 creates a 2-year pilot program for index-based insurance covering extreme weather-related utility costs for poultry growers, to be conducted in top poultry-producing states. The program requires stakeholder engagement and Board approval within two years.  

Sec. 10601 increases annual conservation funding from $625 million (2026) to $700 million (2029–2031), with intermediate increases to $650 million (2027) and $675 million (2028). This expansion supports environmental programs like the Conservation Reserve Program.  

Sec. 10602 authorizes $285 million for the Supplemental Agricultural Trade Promotion Program, effective fiscal year 2027 and each subsequent year. This funding supports international trade initiatives and market development for U.S. agricultural commodities.  

Sec. 10603 extends funding for the Emergency Food Assistance Act through fiscal year 2031, revising Section 203D(d)(5) to replace "2024" with "2031." This ensures continued support for food assistance programs beyond the previous expiration date.
