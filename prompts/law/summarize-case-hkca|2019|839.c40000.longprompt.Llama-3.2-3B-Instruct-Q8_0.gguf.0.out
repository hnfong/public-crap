**Facts of the Case**

The case of HKSAR v. WONG CHO SHING AND OTHERS [2019] HKCA 839; [2019] 4 HKC 401; CACC 38/2017 is a Hong Kong Court of Appeal case involving a joint offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The appellants, all serving police officers, were convicted in the District Court of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against Tsang Kin Chiu on October 15, 2014, outside Lung Wo Road Government Building Pump Station East Substation in Admiralty, Hong Kong. The appellants were sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment each.

The incident occurred during the Occupy Central movement, a large-scale protest in Hong Kong. The police operation, codenamed "Operation Solarpeak," aimed to clear the protesters from the area. Tsang was seen splashing liquid from a plastic bottle onto those on the underpass below, and subsequently, a struggle ensued, resulting in some OC foam (pepper spray) being sprayed at Tsang's face. The police officers then used water to rinse his face. Tsang was handed over to the custody of the appellants, who used water to rinse his face, and then assaulted him at the Substation.

**Arguments of the Parties**

The appellants, represented by Mr. Tim Owen QC, Mr. Clive Grossman SC, and Mr. Benson Tsoi, argued that the judge erred in admitting certain video recordings and photographs into evidence, which they claimed were not authentic. They argued that the prosecution had failed to prove the authenticity of the video recordings and photographs beyond a reasonable doubt. They also argued that the judge's identification of the appellants from the video recordings and photographs was unsafe and unreliable.

The respondent, represented by Mr. Jonathan Caplan QC, Mr. David Leung SC, Ms. Clara Ma, and Ms. June Wong, argued that the judge correctly applied the law in admitting the video recordings and photographs into evidence. They argued that the prosecution had proved the authenticity of the video recordings and photographs beyond a reasonable doubt and that the judge's identification of the appellants was reasonable and reliable.

**Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The Court of Appeal held that the admissibility of video recorded evidence and photographs in criminal cases is a matter of law, and the test for admissibility is whether the evidence, if believed by the jury, would be sufficient to prove the matter beyond reasonable doubt. The Court also held that the authenticity of a video recording can be proved circumstantially, and the prosecution must establish a prima facie case of authenticity by proving the provenance and history of the recordings up to the moment of production in court.

The Court rejected the appellants' argument that the test for admissibility should be the balance of probabilities, instead holding that the correct test is whether the evidence, if believed by the jury, would be sufficient to prove the matter beyond reasonable doubt. The Court also rejected the appellants' argument that the judge erred in finding that the video recordings were authentic beyond a reasonable doubt.

The Court's decision is significant because it establishes that the admissibility of video recorded evidence and photographs in criminal cases is a matter of law, and the test for admissibility is whether the evidence, if believed by the jury, would be sufficient to prove the matter beyond reasonable doubt. The Court's decision also highlights the importance of establishing a prima facie case of authenticity by proving the provenance and history of the recordings up to the moment of production in court.

The Court's decision is also notable for its rejection of the appellants' argument that the judge's identification of the appellants from the video recordings and photographs was unsafe and unreliable. The Court held that the judge's identification was reasonable and reliable, and that the appellants had failed to provide sufficient evidence to challenge the identification.

The Court's decision in this case is also significant because it highlights the importance of establishing the authenticity of video recorded evidence and photographs in criminal cases. The Court's decision establishes that the prosecution must establish a prima facie case of authenticity by proving the provenance and history of the recordings up to the moment of production in court, and that the judge's identification of the appellants from the video recordings and photographs must be reasonable and reliable.

Overall, the Court's decision in this case is a significant development in the law of evidence in Hong Kong, and it establishes important principles for the admissibility of video recorded evidence and photographs in criminal cases. [end of text]
