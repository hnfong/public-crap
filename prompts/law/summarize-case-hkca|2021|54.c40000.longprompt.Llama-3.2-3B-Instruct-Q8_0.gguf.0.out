**Facts of the Case**

The case of KWOK CHEUK KIN AND ANOTHER v. DIRECTOR OF LANDS AND OTHERS [2021] HKCA 54; CACV 317/2019 is a judicial review case that challenges the constitutionality of the New Territories Small House Policy (the "Small House Policy") under the Basic Law of Hong Kong. The policy allows eligible New Territories indigenous villagers to apply for permission to erect a small house on a suitable site within their own village, subject to certain criteria. The applicants, Kwok Cheuk Kin and another, challenged the policy on three grounds: (1) it discriminates against persons of "non-indigenous" status in contravention of articles 25 and 39 of the Basic Law; (2) it discriminates against female indigenous villagers based on sex, in contravention of articles 25 and 39 of the Basic Law; and (3) the Government has failed in its duty to manage, use or develop land in Hong Kong for the benefit of all Hong Kong residents, in contravention of article 7 of the Basic Law.

**Arguments of the Two Parties**

The applicants, Kwok Cheuk Kin and another, argued that the Small House Policy is unconstitutional and discriminatory. They claimed that the policy discriminates against persons of "non-indigenous" status and female indigenous villagers based on sex, in contravention of articles 25 and 39 of the Basic Law. They also argued that the Government has failed in its duty to manage, use or develop land in Hong Kong for the benefit of all Hong Kong residents, in contravention of article 7 of the Basic Law.

The respondents and the interested party, on the other hand, argued that the Ding Rights, which are the rights and interests of the New Territories indigenous inhabitants under the Small House Policy, are protected under the Basic Law. They claimed that the policy is constitutional and lawful, and that the applicants' challenge is unfounded. They argued that the Small House Policy is a traditional right and interest of the NTIIs, and that it is protected by the Basic Law.

**Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) held that the Small House Policy is constitutional and lawful, but only to the extent that it confers benefits on eligible NTIIs in the form of free building licenses. The Court found that the policy discriminates against persons of "non-indigenous" status and female indigenous villagers based on sex, in contravention of articles 25 and 39 of the Basic Law. However, it held that the policy is protected under the Basic Law as a traditional right and interest of the NTIIs, and that it is lawful and constitutional to the extent that it confers benefits on eligible NTIIs in the form of free building licenses.

The Court identified four constituent elements that must be satisfied before protection is given to a right or interest under the Basic Law: (1) there must be some rights and interests; (2) those rights and interests must be lawful; (3) those rights and interests must be traditional; and (4) they must be rights and interests of the NTIIs. The Court found that the Ding Rights, which are the rights and interests of the NTIIs under the Small House Policy, satisfy the first three elements, but not the fourth.

The Court also considered the drafting materials of the Basic Law, including the Seminar Report and the Joint Declaration, to determine the purpose and objective of BL40. It found that the drafters of the Basic Law aimed to protect the traditional rights and interests of the NTIIs, which include the Ding Rights, and that the Small House Policy is a means to achieve this goal.

The Court also considered the concept of "tradition" in the context of the Basic Law, and found that the NTIIs' long-held custom to build houses in their village for their own occupation on their own land since 1898 is a traditional right and interest that is protected under the Basic Law. The Court also found that the Small House Policy is a means to preserve and protect this traditional right and interest.

The Court also considered the concept of "lawfulness" in the context of the Basic Law, and found that the Small House Policy is lawful and constitutional to the extent that it confers benefits on eligible NTIIs in the form of free building licenses. The Court found that the policy discriminates against persons of "non-indigenous" status and female indigenous villagers based on sex, in contravention of articles 25 and 39 of the Basic Law. However, it held that the policy is protected under the Basic Law as a traditional right and interest of the NTIIs, and that it is lawful and constitutional to the extent that it confers benefits on eligible NTIIs in the form of free building licenses.

The Court also considered the concept of "legitimate expectation" in the context of the Small House Policy, and found that the applicants had a legitimate expectation that the policy would be applied consistently and fairly. The Court found that the delay in commencing the judicial review proceedings and the lack of explanation for the delay caused prejudice to the applicants and the public interest.

The Court also considered the concept of "coherence" in the context of the Basic Law, and found that the Small House Policy is a coherent and consistent part of the Basic Law. The Court found that the policy is protected under the Basic Law as a traditional right and interest of the NTIIs, and that it is lawful and constitutional to the extent that it confers benefits on eligible NTIIs in the form of free building licenses.

Overall, the Court's decision in this case establishes that the Small House Policy is constitutional and lawful, but only to the extent that it confers benefits on eligible NTIIs in the form of free building licenses. The Court's decision also highlights the importance of considering the concept of "tradition" in the context of the Basic Law, and the need to balance the need to preserve traditional rights and interests with the need to ensure that policies are fair and non-discriminatory.
