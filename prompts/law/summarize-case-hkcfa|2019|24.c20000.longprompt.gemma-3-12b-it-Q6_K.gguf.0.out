## 1. Summary of Facts

This case, *HKSAR v. Tsang Yam-Kuen (Donald)*, concerns the former Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Donald Tsang, who was charged with bribery and misconduct in public office. The charges stemmed from dealings with mainland businessman Wong Cho-bau regarding the refurbishment and redecoration of a residential property in Shenzhen owned by a company controlled by Wong. Tsang intended to occupy the property after retirement. The prosecution alleged that the refurbishment constituted a bribe in exchange for Tsang’s favorable handling of broadcasting license applications made by Wave Media Limited (later Digital Broadcasting Corporation Hong Kong Limited - DBC), in which Wong held shares.  Additionally, Tsang was accused of failing to disclose these dealings to the Executive Council (ExCo) while they were considering the broadcasting applications.  A jury initially failed to reach a verdict on the bribery charge, convicted Tsang on the misconduct charge, and later failed to reach a verdict on the bribery charge again after a retrial. Tsang appealed his conviction on the misconduct charge, arguing deficiencies in the trial judge's directions to the jury. The case involved complex factual and legal issues, including media interviews given by Tsang explaining his actions and the genuineness of a lease agreement related to the Shenzhen property.



## 2. Summary of Arguments

**Appellant (Donald Tsang):** Tsang’s primary argument centered on the inadequacy of the trial judge’s directions to the jury regarding the charge of misconduct in public office. He argued that the judge failed to adequately explain how the jury should consider the charge independently of the bribery charge, particularly when the jury might have doubts about the bribery allegations. Specifically, he contended that the judge did not sufficiently explain how to assess the elements of wilfulness and seriousness in the context of a non-corrupt arrangement, where the dealings might have been purely commercial and not involve any improper benefit. He asserted that the jury could have convicted him based on a mere deliberate decision not to disclose, rather than a deliberate concealment motivated by dishonesty or corruption.  His defense also maintained that the dealings were arm's-length and commercial, and that he and his wife expected to rent the property at market rental rates after his retirement.

**Respondent (HKSAR - Prosecution):** The prosecution argued that Tsang deliberately concealed his dealings with Wong to hide a corrupt arrangement – the refurbishment of the Shenzhen property as a bribe. They maintained that the failure to disclose was a serious breach of public trust, given Tsang’s position as Chief Executive and President of the ExCo. They emphasized that Tsang was in a position of divided loyalties and that the concealment was integral to a scheme designed to benefit Wong. The prosecution asserted that the jury’s verdicts demonstrated they found Tsang’s actions to be deliberate and indicative of serious misconduct, regardless of their views on the bribery charge. They argued that the trial judge’s directions were sufficient and that the appellant’s arguments were based on a misinterpretation of the jury’s deliberations.



## 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The Court of Appeal’s judgment in *HKSAR v. Tsang Yam-Kuen (Donald)* establishes several important legal principles concerning the offence of misconduct in public office, particularly in the context of non-disclosure and the interplay between different charges. The core of the judgment revolves around the proper direction to the jury when considering an alternative charge, and the elements required to prove misconduct in public office, especially when corruption is not definitively established.

**1. Independent Consideration of Alternative Charges:** The Court firmly established that when a defendant faces multiple charges, each charge must be considered independently by the jury. The jury may consider one charge when deliberating on another, but they are not required to find the defendant guilty on all charges. Critically, the judge must ensure the jury understands that the charges stand or fall independently and must provide directions that reflect this independence.  In this case, the Court found that the trial judge failed to adequately explain to the jury how to approach the misconduct charge (Count 2) if they had doubts about the bribery charge (Count 1). The judge did not sufficiently address the legal principles and factual issues that arose when the allegations of bribery were not made out, and the charge was considered as a true alternative.

**2. Elements of Misconduct in Public Office:** The Court reiterated the established elements of the common law offence of misconduct in public office: (1) a public official; (2) in the course of or in relation to their public office; (3) wilfully misconducts themselves; (4) without reasonable excuse or justification; and (5) the misconduct must be serious. The Court emphasized the significance of elements (3) and (5) – wilfulness and seriousness.

**3. The Meaning of "Wilfulness" and the Requirement of Knowledge:** The Court highlighted the ambiguity surrounding the term "wilfulness" in the context of non-disclosure. While "wilful" means deliberate, it does not necessarily equate to knowing that the conduct was unlawful or disregarding the risk of it being unlawful. The Court acknowledged the guidance from *Sin Kam Wah v HKSAR* (2005) which suggested a need to establish that the official knew their conduct was unlawful. However, the Court did not definitively rule that this knowledge is *always* required. The crucial point is that the direction given to the jury must accurately reflect the possible scenarios and defenses available to the defendant.  The Court found that the trial judge’s direction, which focused on whether the act or omission was "deliberate," was insufficient because it did not adequately address the possibility that the decision not to disclose might have been a deliberate error of judgment, rather than a deliberate act of concealment motivated by dishonesty.

**4. Assessing "Seriousness" in the Absence of Corruption:** The Court underscored the difficulty in assessing the "seriousness" of misconduct in public office when corruption or dishonesty is not established. While the consequences of corrupt or dishonest acts are readily apparent, assessing seriousness in cases of non-disclosure requires a more nuanced analysis. The Court referenced the English Court of Appeal’s guidance in *R v Chapman* [2015] QB 883, suggesting that the trial judge should provide assistance to the jury on how to assess seriousness by placing the conduct in its proper factual context. The Court noted that the trial judge’s direction on seriousness was inadequate in the context of a non-corrupt arrangement, as it did not sufficiently guide the jury on how to evaluate the nature and extent of the departure from the appellant’s responsibilities and the potential consequences of his omission.

**5. The Prosecution's Case and the Risk of Misleading the Jury:** The Court observed that the prosecution’s case was heavily reliant on the allegation of corruption and deliberate concealment to mask that corruption. The Court expressed concern that the trial judge did not adequately address the possibility that the jury might not accept the bribery allegations, and that the directions to the jury were therefore skewed towards the prosecution’s primary narrative. The Court noted that the references to the appellant being "hopelessly compromised" and the "true nature of his relationship with Wong" were framed within the context of the alleged bribery, and did not adequately account for the possibility of a non-corrupt, albeit problematic, arrangement.

**6. The Importance of a Clear Alternative Case Theory:** While the Court acknowledged that the prosecution is not always required to explicitly articulate an alternative case theory, it emphasized that when a primary case fails, the prosecution must ensure that the jury is properly directed on the basis of any alternative theory. In this case, the Court found that the prosecution’s alternative case – that the appellant’s non-disclosure constituted misconduct even without corruption – was not adequately presented or explained to the jury, leading to a risk that they convicted the appellant on a basis that was not fully supported by the evidence or the law.

**Novel and Controversial Points:**

*   **The interplay between "wilfulness" and knowledge of unlawfulness:** The Court’s discussion of *Sin Kam Wah* and the need for a direction on knowledge of unlawfulness, while not definitively establishing a requirement, highlighted a potentially controversial area of the law. It raised the question of whether a deliberate but mistaken decision can ever constitute "wilful" misconduct.
*   **The assessment of seriousness in non-corruption cases:** The Court’s emphasis on the need for guidance on assessing seriousness in the absence of corruption underscored the difficulty in applying the offence of misconduct in public office to situations that do not involve traditional forms of corruption. It suggested that the offence may be too broad and susceptible to misuse in cases where the conduct, while improper, does not involve dishonesty or a clear abuse of power.
*   **The prosecution's framing of the case:** The Court’s critique of the prosecution’s reliance on the bribery narrative and the potential for misleading the jury highlighted the importance of ensuring that prosecutions are not overly focused on a single theory of the case, particularly when alternative explanations are plausible.



In conclusion, the Court’s decision in *HKSAR v. Tsang Yam-Kuen (Donald)* serves as a significant reminder of the importance of clear and comprehensive jury directions in cases involving the offence of misconduct in public office, particularly when alternative charges are involved and the allegations do not definitively establish corruption. The judgment clarifies the elements of the offence, emphasizes the need for careful consideration of the meaning of "wilfulness" and the assessment of "seriousness," and underscores the risk of misleading the jury when the prosecution’s case is heavily reliant on a single, unproven narrative.
