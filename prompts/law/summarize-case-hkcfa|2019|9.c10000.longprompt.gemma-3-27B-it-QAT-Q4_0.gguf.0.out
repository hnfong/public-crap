## Secretary for Justice v. Cheng Ka Yee and 3 Others – Case Summary

### 1. Facts of the Case

Four primary school teachers and a friend were charged under Section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200) for obtaining access to a computer with a view to dishonest gain. The charges stemmed from the teachers sharing interview questions for competitive school admissions via their mobile phones and a school computer. Specifically, three teachers photographed the questions at a briefing and sent them to others via WhatsApp. One teacher then typed the questions into a Word document on a school computer and emailed it to others. All were acquitted at trial, with the magistrate finding reasonable doubt about the confidentiality of the questions and the dishonesty of the actions. The Secretary for Justice appealed, arguing that the act of using their phones and the school computer constituted “obtaining access to a computer” under the law, even if the computers were their own.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**Secretary for Justice (Appellant):** Argued that the term “obtaining access to a computer” in s 161(1)(c) had a broad meaning and should be interpreted to include any use of a computer, even one owned by the user. They cited examples of modern computer misuse (e.g., email forwarding, taking clandestine photos, online fraud) to demonstrate the need for a wide interpretation to cover evolving criminal activity. They emphasized the legislative intent to criminalize preparatory acts of dishonesty, regardless of authorization. They pointed to cases where s 161 *had* been applied to similar conduct, suggesting a natural reading of the statute.

**Respondents (Cheng Ka Yee et al.):** Argued that the charges were inappropriate because the actus reus of “obtaining access to a computer” required unauthorized access. They contended that using one’s own phone or a computer with full authorized access did not meet this requirement. They highlighted the language of the statute ("obtain access") as implying access to something *not* already possessed, and the legislative history suggesting a focus on accessing *other* people’s computers. They argued that a broader interpretation would criminalize commonplace, non-dishonest acts.



### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The core legal principle established in *Secretary for Justice v. Cheng Ka Yee* concerns the interpretation of the actus reus of the offence under Section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200), specifically the phrase “obtaining access to a computer.” The Court of Final Appeal held that the offence does *not* extend to the use by a person of their own computer, unless that use involves gaining access to another computer. This ruling is based on a careful analysis of the statutory text, its context, and legislative history.

**Textual Analysis:** The Court emphasized the ordinary meaning of the words “obtain” and “access.”  “Obtain” implies acquiring something not already possessed, and “access” suggests admittance to something previously unavailable. Using one’s own device does not fit this linguistic understanding. The redundancy of using both “obtain” and “access” further supports the idea that the section is not intended to cover self-use.

**Contextual Analysis:** The Court examined the broader legislative framework surrounding the 1993 amendments to the Crimes Ordinance. Other provisions enacted at the same time, such as s 27A of the Telecommunications Ordinance, explicitly focused on *unauthorized* access to computers. The absence of a similar “unauthorized” requirement in s 161, coupled with the definition of “unauthorized” in s 27A, suggested that s 161 was intended to address different conduct.

**Legislative History:** The Court meticulously reviewed the legislative materials, including the Memorandum for Legislative Council, the Second Reading speeches, and the recommendations of the Legislative Council Subcommittee. These materials consistently pointed to a purpose of criminalizing preparatory acts of dishonesty, specifically gaining access to computers *to* commit a further offence. The focus was on preventing access to *other* people’s systems for fraudulent purposes. The amendment deleting a provision defining “obtaining access” as “causing a computer to perform any function” was also significant, as it suggested a deliberate narrowing of the scope of the offence.  The original draft language, including the phrase "with or without due authority," was also considered, and its omission was seen as reinforcing the focus on unauthorized access.

**Purpose of the Legislation:** The Court determined that the primary purpose of s 161 was to address a gap in the law where preparatory acts of computer-related crime were not punishable. This purpose was best served by focusing on access to *other* people’s computers, where the act of access itself could be seen as a step towards a fraudulent scheme.  Extending the offence to the use of one’s own computer would criminalize commonplace, non-dishonest acts and potentially overreach the legislative intent.

**Novelty and Controversy:** The case was novel in its direct confrontation with the expanding role of personal devices in potential criminal activity.  The Court acknowledged the evolving nature of technology and the need for criminal law to adapt. However, it resisted a broad interpretation of s 161, emphasizing the importance of statutory construction adhering to the original legislative intent. The controversy stemmed from the potential for the narrow interpretation to create loopholes in the law, as highlighted by the appellant
