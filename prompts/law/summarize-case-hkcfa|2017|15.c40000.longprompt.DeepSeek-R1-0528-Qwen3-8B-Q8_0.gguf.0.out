Okay, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want a summary of a legal case involving bribery laws in Hong Kong. The case is Secretary for Justice v. Chan Chi Wan Stephen, which was decided in 2017. The user has four specific tasks: summarize the facts, the arguments, the legal principles, and any striking aspects.

First, I need to parse the case details. The main parties are the Secretary for Justice (prosecution) and the appellants, Stephen Chan and Tseng Pei Kun. The case revolves around whether their actions constitute a bribery offense under Section 9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance. The key elements are Chan's role as a TVB employee, his hosting a show called "Be My Guest," and the collaboration with Olympian City to include a live segment in their New Year's Eve event.

The user is likely a law student or legal professional looking for a concise yet comprehensive breakdown of this case. They might need this for exam preparation, legal research, or understanding how bribery laws are applied in similar scenarios. The unspoken need could be to grasp the nuances of mens rea and the "relation to principal's affairs" test, which are central to this case.

For the facts, I should highlight Chan's employment, the show's popularity, the external engagements, and the specific incident with Olympian City. The prosecution's charges and the trial court's acquittal are crucial here. The arguments section needs to contrast the prosecution's view that Chan's act was "in relation to" TVB's business versus the defense's argument of reasonable excuse due to implicit consent.

The legal principles part is complex. The case hinges on the interpretation of Section 9, especially the mens rea and the restrictive phrase "in relation to." The Court of Appeal's reversal and the subsequent reversal by the higher court using Ch'ng Poh as precedent is a key point. The novel aspect here is the emphasis on the agent's intent and the exclusion of beneficial acts from the offense's scope, which is a departure from traditional bribery cases.

The striking part of the case is the narrow interpretation of Section 9, focusing on detrimental intent. This contrasts with the broader approach in Fung Hok Cheung, where reputational damage sufficed. The user might be interested in how this case sets a precedent for limiting bribery liability to truly corrupt activities, which is significant for both legal practice and corporate compliance.

I should also check if there are any other notable points. The case involved multiple judges, each with their own reasoning, but all agreeing on the outcome. The procedural history with two case statements shows the complexity and the court's thorough examination. The defense of reasonable excuse based on TVB's implicit consent is another important aspect, demonstrating that prosecution must prove detrimental intent beyond reasonable doubt.

The user might not have explicitly mentioned it, but they probably need to understand the practical implications of this case. For example, how it affects agents in private sector employment and the standards for proving mens rea. Also, the balance between the prosecution's burden and the defense's reliance on reasonable excuse, especially in cases where the principal's consent is ambiguous.

I need to ensure that the summary is clear and addresses all parts of the query. The facts should be straightforward, the arguments contrasted properly, the legal principles detailed with references to Ch'ng Poh and other cases, and the striking aspects highlighted. Avoiding jargon where possible but maintaining legal accuracy is key. Also, note the procedural aspects and the final outcome to give a complete picture.

### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case involves Stephen Chan Chi Wan, a General Manager at Television Broadcasts Ltd (TVB), and Tseng Pei Kun, the sole director and shareholder of Idea Empire Advertising & Production Company Limited (IEAP). Chan voluntarily hosted a TV show called "Be My Guest" (also known as "志雲飯局" or "Chi Wan’s Dinner Party" in Chinese), which became popular and led to external engagements. Between June 2008 and January 2010, Chan participated in approximately 20 external events, receiving payment for 18 of them. Tseng acted as Chan’s agent for these external appearances.

In November 2009, Olympian City (OC), the operator of a shopping mall, agreed with TVB to sponsor a New Year’s Eve Countdown show. OC agreed to pay TVB $1.3 million as a sponsorship fee. OC then decided to add a live segment of "Be My Guest" to the Countdown show, with Chan hosting and interviewing Lai Yiu Cheung. OC knew that TVB would not provide its own "top-tier artistes" for this segment and would instead engage external talent. OC approached Tseng (acting through IEAP) to organize Chan’s participation, and agreed to pay IEAP $160,000 for the segment. IEAP then paid Chan $112,000 and Lai Yiu Cheung $20,000, keeping $28,000.

The prosecution charged Chan with accepting an advantage (the $112,000 fee) without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, as an inducement for him to act in relation to TVB’s affairs or business (i.e., participating in the Countdown segment). Tseng was charged with offering the advantage. The trial judge acquitted both appellants, reasoning that Chan’s participation was merely "moonlighting" and not intended to influence or affect TVB’s business.

The Court of Appeal reversed the acquittal, finding that Chan’s act was "in relation to" TVB’s business and that Tseng’s offer was an inducement for that act. However, the Appeal Committee certified two questions of law for the Final Appeal Court, including the interpretation of mens rea and the meaning of "in relation to principal’s affairs or business."

The Final Appeal Court ultimately allowed both appeals and quashed the convictions, concluding that the appellants’ conduct did not fall within the ambit of Section 9 of the POBO. The Court emphasized that Section 9 requires the agent’s act to be aimed at and intended to influence or affect the principal’s affairs or business in a manner detrimental to the principal, and that the prosecution failed to prove this element.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments

**Prosecution (Secretary for Justice):**  
The prosecution argued that Chan’s participation in the Countdown segment was an act "in relation to" TVB’s business, as it was part of a commercial collaboration with OC. They contended that the $112,000 fee was an inducement for Chan to perform in a way that would influence or affect TVB’s contractual relationship with OC, audience ratings, and reputation. The prosecution also argued that Chan lacked a reasonable excuse for accepting the payment, as his employment contract required him to seek approval for outside work.

**Defense (Appellants):**  
The defense argued that Chan’s participation was merely a personal act of hosting and did not relate to TVB’s business or affairs. They claimed that Chan had a reasonable excuse because TVB implicitly consented to his appearance on the Countdown segment, as it was part of their commercial collaboration with OC. The defense also argued that the mens rea required for a Section 9 offense was not met, as Chan did not intend his act to be corrupt or detrimental to TVB.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The case addressed several key legal principles, particularly concerning the interpretation of Section 9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO) and the mens rea required for its offense.

#### **a. Mens Rea Requirement**  
Section 9 offenses require proof of mens rea. The Court clarified that the mental element varies depending on the variant of the offense:  
- For soliciting or accepting an advantage, the prosecution must prove that the accused knew or believed the advantage was provided as an inducement or reward for an act aimed at influencing or affecting the principal’s affairs or business.  
- For offering an advantage, the prosecution must prove that the offeror intended the advantage to be accepted as an inducement or reward for such an act.  

The mens rea is tied to the specific act or forbearance in question. In cases where the advantage is offered or solicited, the accused’s intent is crucial. The Court emphasized that the prosecution must independently assess the mens rea of each party involved in the transaction.

#### **b. Interpretation of "in relation to principal’s affairs or business"**  
The phrase "in relation to principal’s affairs or business" was interpreted restrictively. The Court held that an act must be aimed at and intended to influence or affect the principal’s affairs or business. This was derived from the Privy Council’s decision in *Commissioner of ICAC v Ch’ng Poh*, where Lord Lloyd of Berwick stated that the advantage must be intended to influence or affect the principal’s business.  

The Court rejected the broad interpretation adopted by the Court of Appeal in the lower instance, which held that an act is "in relation to" the principal’s business if it relates to the principal’s programs or activities, even if it is beneficial. The Final Appeal Court clarified that Section 9 targets acts that are detrimental to the principal’s interests, undermining the integrity of the agency relationship. Acts that are merely beneficial or neutral, even if performed without authorization, do not constitute a Section 9 offense.

#### **c. Reasonable Excuse Defense**  
The defense of reasonable excuse requires the accused to prove that their conduct was justified. The Court held that the prosecution bears the burden of proving the absence of a reasonable excuse. In this case, the Court found that Chan’s participation in the Countdown segment was implicitly consented to by TVB, as it was part of their commercial collaboration with OC. Therefore, Chan had a reasonable excuse for accepting the payment.

#### **d. Comparison with *Fung Hok Cheung***  
The Court distinguished *Fung Hok Cheung*, where the prosecution successfully argued that an agent’s act could constitute a Section 9 offense even if it was beneficial, as long as it involved the surreptitious use of confidential information. In contrast, the Court emphasized that Section 9 requires the act to be detrimental to the principal’s interests. The prosecution’s reliance on *Fung Hok Cheung* was misplaced, as the circumstances in that case were different.

#### **e. Impact of the Removal of "corruptly" from Section 9**  
The amendment to Section 9 in 1980 removed the word "corruptly," replacing it with "without lawful authority or reasonable excuse." The Court held that this change did not mean the offense required proof of a corrupt motive. Instead, it required proof that the advantage was solicited or accepted for an act aimed at influencing or affecting the principal’s affairs or business. The prosecution must still demonstrate that the act was detrimental to the principal.

#### **f. Procedural and Burden of Proof Issues**  
The Court noted that Section 24 of the POBO places the burden of proving lawful authority or reasonable excuse on the accused. However, in cases of conspiracy, the prosecution must prove the conspiracy without relying on the reverse onus provisions of Section 24. The Court emphasized that the mens rea for conspiracy is separate from the mens rea for the substantive offense.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

One striking aspect of the case is the narrow interpretation of Section 9 of the POBO. The Final Appeal Court ruled that an agent’s act must be aimed at and intended to influence or affect the principal’s affairs or business in a detrimental way to constitute a Section 9 offense. This is a significant departure from the broader interpretation adopted by the Court of Appeal in the lower instance, which held that any act related to the principal’s business—even if beneficial—could fall within the section.

Another remarkable feature is the emphasis on the agent’s intent. The Court clarified that the prosecution must prove that the agent knew or believed the advantage was being offered for an act aimed at the principal’s business. This places a heavy evidential burden on the prosecution, requiring them to demonstrate not only the act itself but also the agent’s mental state.

The case also highlights the tension between the prosecution’s need to prove detrimental intent and the defense’s reliance on reasonable excuse. In this instance, the defense successfully argued that TVB implicitly consented to Chan’s participation, thereby negating the prosecution’s case. This underscores the importance of context and the need for the prosecution to carefully establish the detrimental nature of the agent’s act.

Finally, the procedural history of the case, with two case statements and multiple appeals, demonstrates the complexity of interpreting Section 9 and the importance of the Final Appeal Court’s role in clarifying the law. The case serves as a landmark decision in Hong Kong’s anti-bribery legislation, setting a clear standard for the prosecution to meet in future cases. [end of text]
