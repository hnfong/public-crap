Based on the text of the **Protection of Critical Infrastructures (Computer Systems) Bill (C2885)**, here are the answers to your questions:

### Question A: Summary, Purpose, and Major Themes

**Summary:**
This Bill establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework to protect the computer systems of Hong Kong's critical infrastructures. It creates a new regulatory regime involving a **Commissioner of Critical Infrastructure (Computer-system Security)** and various **Designated Authorities** (such as the Monetary Authority and Communications Authority). The legislation empowers these authorities to identify critical infrastructures, designate operators, and enforce strict security obligations. It also grants significant investigative and intervention powers to the Commissioner to respond to security threats and incidents.

**Purpose:**
1.  To protect the security of computer systems belonging to Hong Kong's critical infrastructures.
2.  To regulate the operators of such infrastructures (CI Operators).
3.  To provide a legal framework for investigating and responding to computer-system security threats and incidents.

**Major Themes:**
*   **Risk-Based Regulation:** The Bill focuses on "Critical Computer Systems" essential to the core functions of critical infrastructure.
*   **Proactive Security Management:** Operators must maintain security management units, submit security plans, conduct regular risk assessments, and undergo independent audits.
*   **Incident Reporting & Response:** Strict timelines are imposed for reporting security incidents (e.g., 12 hours for core function disruption). Operators must also participate in drills and maintain emergency response plans.
*   **Government Intervention Powers:** The Commissioner has broad powers to direct inquiries, issue warrants to enter premises, seize documents, and even order the suspension or remediation of systems during an investigation.
*   **Enforcement & Penalties:** The Bill introduces significant criminal fines for non-compliance and establishes a mechanism for appeals.

### Question B: Impact, Familiarity, and Concern

**Who does this legislation possibly impact?**
*   **CI Operators:** Organizations designated as operating critical infrastructures in sectors such as Energy, Information Technology, Banking, Air/Land/Maritime Transport, Healthcare, and Telecommunications.
*   **Critical Infrastructure Owners:** Entities that own or control infrastructure that may be designated as critical, even if they are not the primary operators.
*   **Service Providers:** Third-party vendors or suppliers whose services are essential to the core function of a critical infrastructure (as operators must manage contracts with them).
*   **Authorized Officers & Regulating Authorities:** Government officials and designated bodies (e.g., Monetary Authority, Communications Authority) who will enforce the law.

**Who needs to be familiar with this legislation?**
*   **C-Suite Executives & Board Members:** Specifically in the regulated sectors, as they bear ultimate responsibility for compliance.
*   **Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) & IT Directors:** They will be directly responsible for implementing security management units, plans, risk assessments, and audits.
*   **Legal & Compliance Teams:** To understand reporting obligations, liability risks, and the appeal process.
*   **Regulatory Affairs Departments:** To manage interactions with the Commissioner and Designated Authorities.

**Who should be concerned?**
*   **Banking and Financial Institutions:** As they are explicitly listed as regulated organizations under the Monetary Authority.
*   **Telecommunications and Broadcasting Companies:** Regulated by the Communications Authority.
*   **Healthcare Providers:** Hospitals and clinics managing critical data and systems.
*   **Transport Operators:** Airlines, shipping lines, and land transport operators.
*   **Energy Providers:** Power and utility companies.
*   **Any organization** that might be designated as a CI Operator due to the sensitivity of their data or the essential nature of their services to Hong Kong's economy.

### Question D: Liabilities Introduced

The Bill introduces **Criminal Liabilities** (fines and imprisonment) and **Civil Immunity** (protection from liability). There are no new civil liabilities imposed *on* the operators by this Bill, but rather protections *for* them.
