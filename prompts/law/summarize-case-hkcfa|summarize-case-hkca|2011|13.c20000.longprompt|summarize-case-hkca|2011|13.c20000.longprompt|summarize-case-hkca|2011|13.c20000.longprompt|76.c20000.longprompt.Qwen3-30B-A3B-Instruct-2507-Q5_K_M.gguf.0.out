### 1. **Brief Summary of the Facts**

This case, *Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v Chan Chun Chuen and Another* [2011] HKCFA 76, concerns a high-stakes probate dispute over the estate of the late Hong Kong billionaire **Nina Wang**, one of the wealthiest women in Asia. After her death in 2007, two competing wills were presented:

- The **2002 Will**, dated 28 July 2002, was not disputed. It left her entire estate to the **Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd**, a non-profit entity she had established.
- The **2006 Will**, dated 16 October 2006, was claimed by the **Applicant, Chan Chun Chuen**, who asserted he was her sole beneficiary and entitled to her entire estate—estimated at over HK$10 billion.

The **Chinachem Charitable Foundation** (the "Foundation") initiated probate proceedings to validate the 2002 Will and challenge the authenticity of the 2006 Will. Chan Chun Chuen counterclaimed, seeking a declaration that the 2006 Will was valid.

After a **40-day trial**, **Lam J** (a High Court judge) found that the 2006 Will was a **forgery**. He based this conclusion on multiple lines of evidence, including:
- **Handwriting analysis** (expert evidence from the Hong Kong Forensic Science Laboratory),
- **Electrostatic Detection Apparatus (ESDA)** “perfect register” evidence showing the document had been typed and then re-photocopied,
- **Testimony of the attesting witnesses**, Winfield Wong and Ng Shun Mo, whose credibility was undermined by inconsistencies and their failure to recall key details,
- **Inherent improbabilities** in the scenario of a wealthy woman like Nina Wang suddenly disinheriting her family and charitable foundation to leave everything to an unknown individual (Chan Chun Chuen), especially given her known charitable inclinations and prior legal disputes with her siblings.

The **Court of Appeal** upheld Lam J’s findings, dismissing Chan’s appeal. Chan then applied to the **Court of Final Appeal (CFA)** for **leave to appeal**, arguing that the case involved a claim exceeding HK$1 million in value and that the legal questions were of great public importance.

The CFA ultimately **denied leave to appeal** on both grounds: (1) the claim did not meet the “as of right” threshold under section 22(1)(a) of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance because the financial consequences of a successful appeal were not immediately quantifiable due to unresolved issues of will construction; and (2) there were no reasonably arguable grounds for overturning the concurrent factual findings of the lower courts, even under the “discretionary” grounds.

### 2. **Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties**

#### **Applicant (Chan Chun Chuen):**
- **As of Right Ground**: Argued that the appeal involved a claim to property worth over HK$1 million (the entire estate), and that the 2006 Will’s validity, if proven, would directly entitle him to the entire estate. He relied on two prior Court of Appeal decisions (*Wang Din Shin v Nina Kung* and *Re Estate of Mui Yim Fong*) where similar probate claims were deemed to qualify for leave as of right because the outcome would be “winner takes all.”
- **Important Question Ground**: Contended that the Court’s long-standing practice of refusing to review **concurrent findings of fact** (i.e., findings agreed upon by both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal) was unjustified and outdated. He argued that this practice, derived from the Privy Council’s jurisprudence, should be abandoned because it prevents the final court from correcting potential factual errors, especially in cases of grave injustice.
- **“Or Otherwise” Ground**: Argued that the Court of Appeal’s judgment was so inadequate and perfunctory that it did not constitute genuine concurrent findings, thereby bypassing the usual bar on reviewing factual findings.
- **New Evidence Ground**: Submitted that **three Police statements** taken from Winfield Wong in 2009—revealing that he had contradicted his own witness statement—undermined the credibility of a key witness. He claimed these statements showed Wong had “recanted” crucial testimony about the 2006 Will being a “partial will,” and that there were “serious discrepancies” between the two attesting witnesses regarding the identity of the beneficiary.

#### **Respondent (Chinachem Charitable Foundation):**
- **As of Right Ground**: Argued that the claim was not for a specific proprietary right or property, but merely for a **declaration of validity** of a will. The financial benefit was not immediate or quantifiable because the 2006 Will’s effect depended on its **construction**—specifically, whether it revoked the 2002 Will or operated as a partial codicil. Since this issue remained unresolved, the financial impact could not be determined, and thus the threshold was not met.
- **Discretionary Grounds**: Maintained that the lower courts had made **concurrent findings of fact** on all material issues, and that the CFA should not interfere unless there was a **miscarriage of justice** or **violation of law**. The Foundation emphasized that the Court’s role is to decide **points of law of public importance**, not to re-litigate facts already thoroughly examined.
- **Rebuttal of New Evidence**: Argued that the Police statements were **inconsequential** and did not amount to a recantation. The discrepancies were minor, and the statements were made under different circumstances (in police interviews, not in court), with Wong clarifying that his 7 April 2007 statement reflected his **hypothetical opinions** after seeing the 2006 Will, not actual events on 16 October 2006. The Foundation also pointed out that Ng Shun Mo’s testimony corroborated Wong’s core evidence about the document being a partial will.

### 3. **Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) – Detailed and Thorough**

The **ratio decidendi** of *Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v Chan Chun Chuen* is multifaceted and deeply rooted in the **structure and function of Hong Kong’s final appellate system**, particularly the **narrow interpretation of the “as of right” appeal threshold** and the **rigorous protection of concurrent factual findings**. The judgment is notable not only for its clarity but also for its **forward-looking critique of the jurisdiction’s outdated appeal regime**, making it a landmark in the evolution of Hong Kong’s constitutional and procedural law.

#### **A. The “As of Right” Ground: Narrow Construction of Section 22(1)(a)**

The central legal issue was whether the appeal qualified for **leave to appeal as of right** under **section 22(1)(a)** of the *Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance*, which allows appeals where the claim involves property or civil rights valued at **HK$1 million or more**.

The Court reaffirmed the **narrow and restrictive interpretation** of this provision, building on two key precedents: *China Field Ltd v Appeal Tribunal (Buildings) (No 1)* [2009] 12 HKCFAR 68 and *WLK v TMC (No 1)* [2009] 12 HKCFAR 473. The Court distilled the following **eight principles**:

1. **Appeals as of right are exceptional** in courts of final appeal. They are “oppressive” to the successful party in the Court of Appeal and undermine the Court’s discretion to prevent frivolous or vexatious appeals.
2. **Section 22(1)(a) must be narrowly construed**, especially the second limb, to avoid undermining the established interpretation of the first limb (which applies only to **liquidated claims**).
3. **Unliquidated claims**—such as those in probate disputes—are **not covered** by section 22(1)(a), even if the potential value exceeds HK$1 million.
4. The claim must be **to a particular property or proprietary right**, not merely incidental to it. A claim for a declaration of will validity is not, in itself, a claim to property.
5. The **value of the claim** must be **clearly quantifiable** and **immediately determinable** upon the Court’s decision.
6. The **order sought** must have **immediate financial effect**—not just a likely or eventual outcome.
7. The phrase “directly or indirectly” refers to the **nature of the claim**, not the timing of its consequences. It does not dilute the requirement of **immediacy**.
8. The **threshold amount** is assessed based on the **subject-matter of the appeal**, not on the value of connected property.

The Court applied these principles rigorously to the present case. While the **estate’s value** was undoubtedly over HK$1 billion, the **Applicant’s claim** was not for a specific proprietary right but for a **declaration of validity** of a will. Crucially, **Issue 9**—whether the 2006 Will was a **partial will** (codicil) or a **complete revocation** of the 2002 Will—remained unresolved. If the 2006 Will was only a partial will, it would not have revoked the 2002 Will, and the Applicant would not have inherited the entire estate. Therefore, **the financial benefit was not immediately quantifiable**.

This is a **novel and significant point**: the Court held that **even in a “winner-takes-all” probate case**, if the **legal construction of the will is uncertain**, the appeal **does not qualify** for leave as of right. This distinguishes *Chinachem* from earlier cases like *Wang Din Shin* and *Mui Yim Fong*, where the Court of Appeal had found that the outcome would be immediate and total. In those cases, the wills were either valid or invalid, with no intermediate construction issues. Here, the **existence of a genuine issue of construction** broke the chain of immediacy.

#### **B. The “Important Question” and “Or Otherwise” Grounds: The Sanctity of Concurrent Findings**

The Court addressed the **Applicant’s challenge to the practice of not reviewing concurrent findings of fact**, a doctrine inherited from the **Privy Council** and codified in *Sky Heart Ltd v Lee Hysan Estate Co Ltd* [1997-1998] 1 HKCFAR 318.

The Court reiterated that **concurrent findings of fact**—those made by both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal—are **not reviewable** unless there is:
- A **miscarriage of justice**, or
- A **violation of a principle of law or procedure** that would render the finding unsustainable.

This principle is **not arbitrary** but rooted in **policy and institutional function**:
- The **CFA’s primary role** is to resolve **points of law of general public importance**, not to re-litigate facts.
- Allowing third-tier factual review would **prolong litigation**, **increase costs**, and **undermine finality**.
- The **combined judgment of two courts** (trial and appellate) creates a **strong presumption of correctness**.
- As Lord Steyn noted, the Court of Final Appeal is “confronted with the combined views of the first instance judge and the Court of Appeal,” making it “initially senseless” to suppose it should reach a different conclusion.

The Court rejected the Applicant’s argument that this practice should be abandoned. It emphasized that:
- The **policy reasons** (finality, efficiency, judicial economy) are **compelling**.
- The **practice is not based on deference to local conditions** (which no longer applies post-1997), but on **institutional design**.
- The **majority of Commonwealth jurisdictions** (Australia, New Zealand
