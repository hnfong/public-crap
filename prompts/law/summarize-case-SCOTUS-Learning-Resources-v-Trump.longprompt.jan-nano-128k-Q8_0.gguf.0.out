Okay, let's tackle this case summary. First, I need to recall the case details. The case is about whether the President can impose tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The main issue is whether IEEPA authorizes the President to impose tariffs, which the plaintiffs argue it doesn't, while the government says it does.

The facts: President Trump used IEEPA to address drug trafficking and trade deficits, declaring national emergencies and imposing tariffs. The tariffs were challenged in court, and the government's argument was based on IEEPA's language about regulating importation. The majority opinion, led by Chief Justice Roberts, says IEEPA doesn't authorize tariffs because Congress didn't clearly delegate that power. The dissent, led by Justice Kavanagh, argues that the tariffs are a clear part of regulating importation under IEEPA.

For the majority's legal principles, they rely on the major questions doctrine, which requires clear congressional authorization for significant executive actions. They emphasize that tariffs are a branch of the taxing power, which is reserved for Congress. They also point out that IEEPA doesn't mention tariffs or duties, and that the government's interpretation is too broad. The dissent counters that the term "regulate" in IEEPA includes tariffs, citing historical precedents and statutory interpretations from other cases.

The case is striking because it's a major constitutional question about the scope of executive power, especially in the context of emergency statutes. The majority's application of the major questions doctrine is novel, as it's not typically used in foreign affairs contexts. The dissent argues that the Court should defer to Congress's historical use of the term "regulate" to include tariffs, which is a different approach. The case also highlights the tension between the President's emergency powers and the need for clear statutory authorization, which is a significant point in the separation of powers discussion.

### 1. **Facts of the Case**  
President Donald Trump, shortly after taking office, invoked the **International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)** to address two foreign threats: the influx of illegal drugs from Canada, Mexico, and China, and “large and persistent” trade deficits. He declared national emergencies under IEEPA and imposed tariffs to counter these threats. Specifically, he imposed a 25% duty on Canadian and Mexican imports, a 10% duty on Chinese imports, and a 10% “reciprocal” tariff on imports from all trading partners. These tariffs were later modified multiple times, including increasing rates on Chinese goods from 10% to 125% and exempting certain products.  

The plaintiffs, including two small businesses (Learning Resources) and five small businesses plus 12 states (V.O.S. Selections), sued the government, arguing that IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs. The **United States District Court for the District of Columbia** granted a preliminary injunction, concluding that IEEPA does not grant the President the power to impose tariffs. The **United States Court of International Trade (CIT)** and the **Federal Circuit** also ruled against the tariffs, with the Federal Circuit affirming that IEEPA’s grant of authority to “regulate importation” does not include tariffs, which are “unbounded in scope, amount, and duration.” The government petitioned for certiorari, and the Supreme Court granted the petitions, consolidating the cases.  

### 2. **Arguments of the Two Parties**  
**Plaintiffs (Learning Resources and V.O.S. Selections):**  
- Argued that **IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs**. They emphasized that the Constitution grants Congress exclusive authority to impose tariffs under Article I, Section 8, which includes the power to “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises.”  
- Contended that the term “regulate importation” in IEEPA does not encompass taxation, as tariffs are a distinct and core constitutional power. They also highlighted that Congress has historically used specific terms like “duty” or “tariff” in tariff statutes, not “regulate.”  
- Argued that the **major questions doctrine** applies here, requiring clear congressional authorization for the President to impose tariffs, which IEEPA lacks. They stressed that the tariffs are of “extraordinary significance” and that Congress would not have delegated such power through ambiguous language.  

**Government (Defendants):**  
- Argued that IEEPA **does authorize the President to impose tariffs**. They interpreted the phrase “regulate importation” as a broad delegation of tariff authority, citing historical precedents where the President used similar language in statutes like the **Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA)** to justify tariffs.  
- Contended that the **major questions doctrine** does not apply to emergency statutes, and that the President’s actions under IEEPA are consistent with Congress’s intent to grant him broad authority to address foreign threats. They also emphasized that the tariffs are a “means of regulation” and that Congress has not historically restricted the President’s use of IEEPA to impose tariffs.  
- Argued that the **major questions doctrine** is not a “magic words” test, and that Congress’s delegation of authority to “regulate importation” in IEEPA includes tariffs, as evidenced by past statutory interpretations and the President’s longstanding practice of using IEEPA to impose tariffs during emergencies.

### 3. **Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) for the Majority Decision**  
The **majority opinion** (led by Chief Justice Roberts) concludes that **IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs**, and that the **major questions doctrine** applies to this case. The majority’s reasoning is rooted in the **constitutional separation of powers**, emphasizing that Congress alone holds the power to tax and regulate importation, and that the President cannot unilaterally impose tariffs without explicit congressional authorization.  

**Key Legal Principles:**  
1. **Constitutional Authority of Congress Over Tariffs:**  
   - The majority reaffirms that the **power to impose tariffs is a core constitutional power reserved for Congress** under Article I, Section 8. The Framers explicitly recognized that tariffs are a “branch of the taxing power,” and that Congress alone has “access to the pockets of the people.” The majority rejects the government’s argument that IEEPA’s “regulate importation” clause implicitly includes tariffs, noting that **tariffs are distinct from taxation** and that Congress has never used the term “regulate” to authorize taxation in other statutes.  

2. **Major Questions Doctrine:**  
   - The majority applies the **major questions doctrine**, which requires that **Congress must clearly authorize the President to exercise significant powers** (e.g., those with “economic and political significance”). The doctrine is not limited to statutory language but also considers **constitutional structure** and **legislative intent**. The majority argues that the President’s assertion of tariff authority under IEEPA is a “transformative expansion” of his power, as Congress has never explicitly granted such authority through IEEPA’s text.  
   - The majority emphasizes that **IEEPA’s language is ambiguous** and that the President’s reliance on it to impose tariffs is inconsistent with the **“clear and limited” delegations** Congress has historically used for tariff authority. For example, Congress has always used specific terms like “duty” or “tariff” in tariff statutes, not “regulate.”  

3. **Historical and Legislative Context:**  
   - The majority points to **historical precedents** showing that the President has never used IEEPA to impose tariffs, even though it has been invoked for other purposes (e.g., blocking imports or prohibiting transactions). This lack of historical precedent, combined with the President’s broad claims, suggests that the tariffs extend beyond his “legitimate reach.”  
   - The majority also rejects the government’s argument that **IEEPA’s “regulate importation” clause includes tariffs**, noting that **tariffs are a tax on imports** and that the Constitution prohibits taxing exports. The majority further argues that the **“neighboring words”** in IEEPA (e.g., “regulate,” “block,” “prohibit”) do not inherently include the power to tax, and that the President’s interpretation of IEEPA as granting tariff authority is “extravagant” by any measure.  

4. **Statutory Interpretation and Separation of Powers:**  
   - The majority stresses that **statutory interpretation must align with constitutional text and structure**. The phrase “regulate importation” is interpreted as **not encompassing taxation**, as tariffs are a distinct power. The majority also notes that **Congress has not historically delegated tariff authority to the President** through vague or broad language, and that the President’s actions under IEEPA would require a “clear congressional authorization” that is absent.  

5. **Controversial Interpretation of “Regulate”:**  
   - The majority challenges the government’s reading of “regulate” as including tariffs, arguing that **“regulate” typically means to adjust or control imports through rules or restrictions**, not to impose taxes. They cite **Black’s Law Dictionary** and historical cases (e.g., *Gibbons v. Ogden*) to show that tariffs are a separate power from regulation. The majority also rejects the government’s reliance on the **“regulate importation” language** in IEEPA, noting that **Congress has never used that term to authorize taxation** in other statutes.  

**Novelty/Controversy:**  
- The majority’s application of the **major questions doctrine** to IEEPA is novel, as it is not typically invoked in foreign affairs contexts. They argue that the President’s assertion of tariff authority under IEEPA is a “transformative expansion” of his power, which Congress would not have intended.  
- The majority’s rejection of the government’s historical argument (e.g., that the President has used TWEA to justify tariffs) is also controversial, as it contradicts the **Federal Circuit’s** earlier holding that TWEA’s “regulate importation” clause did authorize tariffs.

### 4. **Legal Principles and Arguments of the Dissenting Side**  
The **dissenting opinion** (led by Justice Kavanagh) argues that **IEEPA clearly authorizes the President to impose tariffs** and that the majority’s application of the major questions doctrine is flawed. Key points include:  

1. **Statutory Text and Historical Usage:**  
   - The dissent asserts that **“regulate importation” in IEEPA includes tariffs**, citing **dictionary definitions** and **historical precedents**. They argue that the President’s use of IEEPA to impose tariffs is consistent with Congress’s intent, as the term “regulate” has long been understood to encompass tariffs, which are a common tool for regulating foreign commerce.  
   - The dissent points to **past statutory interpretations** (e.g., *Federal Energy Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc.*, 426 U.S. 548) where the Court upheld the President’s authority to impose tariffs under similar language. They argue that the majority’s rejection of these precedents is inconsistent with the **textualist approach** to statutory interpretation.  

2. **Foreign Affairs Exception to the Major Questions Doctrine:**  
   - The dissent contends that the **major questions doctrine does not apply to foreign affairs statutes**, as Congress often grants the President broad discretion in foreign policy. They argue that the Court’s reliance on the major questions doctrine in this case is a “novel and unprecedented” extension of the doctrine into the foreign affairs realm, which contradicts the Court’s historical recognition that **Congress may delegate authority to the President in foreign affairs without requiring explicit clarity**.  

3. **Congressional Intent and Delegation Practices:**  
   - The dissent emphasizes that **Congress has consistently delegated tariff authority to the President** through statutes like the **Trade Expansion Act of 1962** (Section 232) and the **Trade Act of 1974** (Sections 122, 201, 301). They argue that the majority’s claim that Congress did not intend to delegate tariff authority is **unsupported by the statutory text or legislative history**.  
   - The dissent also highlights that **the President’s use of IEEPA to impose tariffs is not “unheralded”** but rather a continuation of longstanding practices, including the **Nixon and Ford tariffs** under TWEA, which were upheld by courts.  

4. **Rejection of the Major Questions Doctrine’s Application:**  
   - The dissent argues that the **major questions doctrine is not a “magic words” test** and that the majority’s insistence on explicit statutory references to “tariff” or “duty” is **unjustified**. They note that the majority’s reasoning would invalidate **other statutes** (e.g., Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act) that authorize the President to “adjust the imports” without explicitly mentioning tariffs.  
   - The dissent also rejects the majority’s claim that the President’s actions are “extraordinary,” arguing that **tariff authority is a routine and well-established power** for the President, even during emergencies.  

5. **Separation of Powers and Congressional Role:**  
   - The dissent emphasizes that **Congress retains the power to revoke or limit the President’s authority** through appropriations or new legislation. They argue that the majority’s decision would **undermine Congress’s role in foreign affairs** by requiring it to “pawn” major policy decisions to the President.  

---

### 5. **Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case**  
- **First Application of the Major Questions Doctrine to IEEPA:**  
  The majority’s decision marks the **first time the major questions doctrine has been applied to IEEPA**, a statute that was not previously interpreted as granting the President tariff authority. This is a **novel constitutional interpretation** that could set a precedent for other statutes.  

- **Contradiction with Historical Precedents:**  
  The majority’s rejection of the government’s historical argument (e.g., that the President has used TWEA to justify tariffs) is **controversial**, as the **Federal Circuit** and **lower courts** have previously upheld such interpretations. The dissent argues that the majority’s reasoning is **inconsistent with the Court’s own precedents** in cases like *Federal Energy Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc.*, where the Court recognized that “adjust the imports” could include tariffs.  

- **Tension Between Tariff Power and Taxing Power:**  
  The case highlights the **constitutional distinction** between **tariff authority** (a tool for regulating foreign commerce) and **taxing power** (a core constitutional authority reserved for Congress). The majority’s insistence that tariffs are a separate power is **controversial**, as the dissent argues that the two are inherently linked and that the President’s use of IEEPA to impose tariffs is a **legitimate exercise of regulatory authority**.  

- **Impact on Trade Agreements and Economic Policy:**  
  The majority’s decision could **disrupt international trade agreements** that rely on the President’s ability to impose tariffs under IEEPA. The government argues that the tariffs have helped facilitate trade deals worth trillions, but the majority’s ruling would require **refunds** of billions in tariffs, creating **economic uncertainty**.  

- **Dissenting Opinions Highlighting the “Foreign Affairs Exception”:**  
  The dissenting opinions (particularly those of Kavanagh and Thomas) argue that the **major questions doctrine should not apply to foreign affairs statutes**, as Congress often grants the President broad discretion in this area. This **contradicts the majority’s stance** and raises questions about the **Court’s consistency** in applying the doctrine across different statutory contexts.  

- **The Role of the President in Foreign Policy:**  
  The case underscores the **tension between the President’s emergency powers and the need for clear congressional authorization**. The dissent argues that the President’s authority to regulate importation during emergencies is **a traditional and well-established power**, while the majority sees it as a “transformative expansion” of executive authority.  

This case is remarkable for its **constitutional and statutory interpretation challenges**, as it tests the limits of the major questions doctrine in the context of foreign policy and emergency powers, and it highlights the **historical and textual ambiguity** of the term “regulate importation.” The majority’s decision is a **landmark ruling** on the separation of powers, while the dissenting opinions reflect a **textualist and historical approach** that emphasizes Congress’s role in foreign affairs.
