Okay, I need to summarize the changes for each section of this bill, starting with Sec. 70501. The user wants a concise, specific summary for each section, with at most one paragraph of four sentences. They mentioned being specific about parties, entities, and quantities, so I need to make sure each summary includes those details.

First, let me look at Sec. 70501: Termination of previously-owned clean vehicle credit. The original section 25E(g) is amended by changing the termination date from December 31, 2032, to September 30, 2025. So the credit is terminated for previously-owned vehicles by that date. The key parties here are the IRS and the taxpayers. The quantity is the specific date change. I need to mention that the credit is terminated for vehicles acquired before September 30, 2025, and that the change affects the termination date.

Next, Sec. 70502: Termination of clean vehicle credit. Section 30D(h) is amended to change the acquisition date from after December 31, 2032 to after September 30, 2025.

Also, a conforming amendment to section 25C(d)(2)(C) adds specific efficiency criteria. The parties are the IRS, and the entities are taxpayers. The quantity is the date change and the new efficiency criteria.

Sec. 70506: Termination of residential clean energy credit. Section 25D(h) is changed to terminate for expenditures after December 31, 2025. Conforming amendments modify other sections to adjust the percentage and remove certain paragraphs. The parties are the IRS, and the entities are taxpayers. The quantity is the date change and the adjustments to percentages.

Sec. 70507: Termination of energy efficient commercial buildings deduction. Section 179D is amended to terminate the deduction for property constructed after June 30, 2026. The parties are the IRS, and the entities are taxpayers. The quantity is the date change.

Sec. 70508: Termination of new energy efficient home credit. Section 45L(h) is changed to terminate by June 30, 2026. The parties are the IRS, and the entities are taxpayers. The quantity is the date change.

Sec. 70509: Termination of cost recovery for energy property. Section 168(e)(3)(B)(vi) is amended to remove subclause (I) and renumber subclauses (II) and (III) as (I) and (II). The effective date is December 31, 2024. The parties are the IRS, and the entities are taxpayers. The quantity is the date change and the removal of subclause (I).

Sec. 70510: Modifications of zero-emission nuclear power production credit. Section 45U(c) adds new paragraph (3) restricting credits for taxpayers that are specified foreign entities or foreign-influenced entities. The effective date is after the bill's enactment. The parties are the IRS, and the entities are taxpayers and foreign entities. The quantity is the new restrictions and the effective date.

Sec. 70511: Termination of clean hydrogen production credit. Section 45V(c)(3)(C) changes the termination date from January 1, 2033 to January 1, 2028. The parties are the IRS, and the entities are taxpayers. The quantity is the date change.

Sec. 70512: Termination and restrictions on clean electricity production credit. Section 45Y(d) is modified to terminate for wind and solar facilities placed in service after December 31, 2027. Also, new restrictions on foreign entities. The parties are the IRS, and the entities are taxpayers and foreign entities. The quantity is the date change and the new restrictions.

Sec. 70513: Termination and restrictions on clean electricity investment credit. Section 48E(e) is modified to terminate for wind and solar facilities placed in service after December 31, 2027. Also, new restrictions on foreign entities and a recapture provision. The parties are the IRS, and the entities are taxpayers and foreign entities. The quantity is the date change and the recapture rules.

Sec. 70514: Phase-out and restrictions on advanced manufacturing production credit. Section 45X(b)(3) is modified to phase out for certain critical minerals after 2030 and terminate for wind components after 2027. Also, new restrictions on foreign entities. The parties are the IRS, and the entities are taxpayers and foreign entities. The quantity is the phase-out dates and termination dates.

Sec. 70515: Restriction on the extension of advanced energy project credit program. Section 48C(e)(3)(C) changes the credit to not be increased. The effective date is the date of enactment. The parties are the IRS, and the entities are taxpayers. The quantity is the restriction on increasing the credit.

For each of these sections, I need to make sure the summary is concise, mentions the parties (IRS, taxpayers, etc.), entities (specific sections of the tax code), and quantities (dates, percentages, etc.). Also, check if there are any specific entities mentioned, like "specified foreign entities" or "foreign-influenced entities" as defined in other sections. The user wants specific details, so I need to include those definitions where applicable. Also, note the effective dates and any new provisions added.

I need to avoid being vague and ensure each summary is a single paragraph with up to four sentences. Let me check each section again to make sure I capture all the key points. For example, in Sec. 70510, the new paragraph (3) adds restrictions on prohibited foreign entities, which are defined in sections 7701(a)(51)(B) and (D). So I should mention those definitions in the summary.

Also, in Sec. 70512, the new subsection (h) denies credit for wind and solar leasing arrangements if the taxpayer leases the property to a third party. That's a key point to include.

I need to be careful with the exact wording of the amendments, like the specific percentages and dates. For example, in Sec. 70513, the domestic content rules change the percentage from 40% to 45% for certain facilities starting June 16, 2025.

Each summary should start with the section number, then the main change, the parties involved, the entities affected, and the specific quantities or dates. Make sure not to miss any of the key amendments, especially the new definitions or restrictions.
