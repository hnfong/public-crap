Okay, I need to help the user understand the bill by summarizing each section with specific details. They want a concise summary for each "Sec." starting with Sec. 50101. Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.

First, Sec. 50101 is about Onshore oil and gas leasing. The user mentioned that the Inflation Reduction Act provisions are repealed. So, I need to note that subsections (a) and (e) of section 50262 are repealed. Then, the Secretary must immediately resume quarterly lease sales in compliance with the Mineral Leasing Act. The specific states listed are Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Nevada, and Alaska. The requirement is to offer at least 50% of available parcels in those states. Also, there's a replacement sale if certain conditions are met, like if a lease sale is canceled or if 25% of acreage doesn't get a bid. The amendment to section 17 of the Mineral Leasing Act adds a 4-year term for permits and allows commingling of production under certain conditions. I need to make sure I include all these specifics in one paragraph, keeping it under four sentences.

Next, Sec. 50102 is Offshore oil and gas leasing. The user wants details on the number of lease sales required. For the Gulf of America region, 30 region-wide sales by 2025, with specific timing: at least one by Dec 15, 2025, then two per year from 2026-2039, and one in 2040. For Alaska, 6 sales in the Cook Inlet area, with one each year from 2026-2028 and 2030-2032 by March 15. The royalty rate is set between 12.5% and 16.67%, and for Alaska sales starting in 2034, 70% goes to Alaska, 30% to the Treasury. Also, the area offered is at least 80 million acres in the Gulf and 1 million in Alaska. I need to mention these numbers and the specific sections repealed.

Sec. 50103 is about royalties on extracted methane. It repeals section 50263 of the Inflation Reduction Act, which was related to methane royalties. That's straightforward, just a repeal of a specific section.

Sec. 50104 is Alaska oil and gas leasing. The Secretary must conduct 4 lease sales area-wide by 10 years after enactment. The initial sale is within 1 year, then every 2 years up to 7 years. The acreages are at least 400,000 acres each sale, and the areas with highest potential. The revenue sharing is 50% to Alaska from 2025-2033, then 70% starting 2034. Also, the terms and conditions are based on the Coastal Plain Record of Decision.

Sec. 50105 is the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. It restores the leasing program, requiring 5 lease sales by 2035. The initial sale is within 1 year, then every 2 years up to 2034. The acreages are 4 million each sale, and the revenue is 70% to Alaska starting 2034. The terms are based on the NPR-A final environmental impact statement and record of decision.

Now, I need to check if each summary is concise, specific, and includes all the key entities and quantities. Make sure not to miss any important details like the exact percentages, the number of sales, the states involved, and the specific sections repealed. Also, ensure that each summary is one paragraph with at most four sentences. Avoid vague terms and stick to the exact numbers and entities mentioned. Let me structure each section accordingly, starting with Sec. 50101 and moving through the rest.

**Sec. 50101. Onshore oil and gas leasing.**  
The Inflation Reduction Act provisions for onshore oil and gas royalty rates (Sec. 50262) are repealed, restoring prior law. The Secretary of the Interior must immediately resume quarterly lease sales in Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Nevada, and Alaska, offering at least 50% of available parcels in each state. Replacement sales are required if a lease sale is canceled, delayed, or if 25% of offered acreage lacks bids. Section 17 of the Mineral Leasing Act is amended to require a 4-year term for permits and allow commingling of production from multiple sources if technical conditions are met.  

**Sec. 50102. Offshore oil and gas leasing.**  
The Secretary of the Interior must conduct 30 region-wide offshore lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico by 2025, with at least one by December 15, 2025, and two annually from 2026–2039 (one by March 15, one after March 15 but no later than August 15). For Alaska’s Cook Inlet area, 6 lease sales are required by 2028 and 2032, with at least one by March 15 each year. Royalty rates for Gulf sales are set between 12.5% and 16.67%, while Alaska sales starting in 2034 allocate 70% to Alaska and 30% to the Treasury.  

**Sec. 50103. Royalties on extracted methane.**  
Section 50263 of the Inflation Reduction Act (136 Stat. 2056) is repealed, removing the provision for methane royalties. This eliminates a federal requirement to impose additional royalties on methane extracted from federal lands, reverting to prior regulatory frameworks.  

**Sec. 50104. Alaska oil and gas leasing.**  
The Secretary must conduct 4 lease sales area-wide under the Coastal Plain program by 2035, with the first sale within 1 year of enactment and subsequent sales every 2 years up to 7 years later. Each sale must offer at least 400,000 acres, prioritizing high-potential hydrocarbon areas. Revenue from these sales is allocated 50% to Alaska from 2025–2033, then 70% starting in 2034, with the balance going to the Treasury.  

**Sec. 50105. National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.**  
The Secretary is required to resume oil and gas lease sales in the NPR-A areas by 2035, with 5 sales mandated (initial by 2025, then every 2 years). Each sale must offer at least 4 million acres, and revenue from sales is 70% to Alaska starting in 2034, with 30% to the Treasury. The terms and conditions for leases are based on the NPR-A final environmental impact statement and record of decision, ensuring compliance with approved resource management plans.  

**Sec. 50201. Coal leasing.**  
The Secretary must process qualified coal applications within 90 days of enactment, resuming lease sales for federal coal reserves adjacent to state or private land. The Secretary is required to issue leases for at least 4 million acres on federal land in the 48 contiguous states and Alaska, excluding protected areas like National Monuments or National Wildlife Refuges.  

**Sec. 50202. Coal royalty.**  
Section 7(a) of the Mineral Leasing Act is amended to set coal royalty rates at 12.5% (up to 7% from 2025–2034). Existing leases not terminated before enactment are subject to the new rate, and advance royalties paid under the old rate are credited to lessees for the difference.  

**Sec. 50203. Leases for known recoverable coal resources.**  
The Secretary must make available at least 4 million additional acres of federal coal resources in the 48 contiguous states and Alaska for leasing, excluding lands designated as protected under federal law (e.g., National Wilderness areas). This includes lands not previously excluded from leasing under resource management plans or other statutes.  

**Sec. 50204. Authorization to mine federal coal.**  
Federal coal reserves adjacent to state or private land are authorized for mining if they are not economically viable without such authorization. The Secretary must take steps to authorize these reserves within 90 days of enactment, without altering existing environmental reviews.  

**Sec. 50301. Timber sales and long-term contracting.**  
The Secretary must sell at least 250 million board-feet of timber annually on National Forest System land from 2026–2034, exceeding previous years’ sales. The Secretary must also enter into 40 long-term timber contracts with private entities for the National Forest System, each lasting at least 20 years, with proceeds deposited into the general fund.  

**Sec. 50302. Renewable energy fees on federal land.**  
The Secretary collects acreage rent for renewable energy projects on federal land using a formula: Acreage rent = A × B × ((1 + C)/D), where A is the per-acre rate, B is the encumbrance factor (100% for solar, 10%–30% for wind), C is 3%, and D is the lease term. Payments are due by January 1 of each year, with late fees and potential termination if payments are not made within 90 days.  

**Sec. 50303. Renewable energy revenue sharing.**  
Revenues from renewable energy projects are deposited into the Treasury, with 25% allocated to the state and 25% to counties based on land percentages. Payments to states and counties are made in the following fiscal year, in addition to payments in lieu of taxes.  

**Sec. 50304. Rescission of National Park Service and Bureau of Land Management funds.**  
Unobligated balances from sections 50221, 50222, and 50223 of the Inflation Reduction Act (136 Stat. 2052) are rescinded, removing funding for these agencies under the repealed provisions.
