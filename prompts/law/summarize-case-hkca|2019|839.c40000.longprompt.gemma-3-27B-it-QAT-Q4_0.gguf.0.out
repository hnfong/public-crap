## HKSAR v. Wong Cho Shing and Others [2019] HKCA 839: Case Summary

### 1. Facts of the Case

In February 2017, seven police officers (D1-D7) were convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against Tsang Kin Chiu on October 15, 2014, during the Occupy Central protests. D5 was also convicted of a separate charge of common assault against Tsang later that same day. The incident involved Tsang being confronted by police officers, a struggle, being restrained, and then allegedly being assaulted by the officers at a substation. The prosecution’s case was a joint enterprise, with senior officers (D1 & D2) overseeing the assault carried out by subordinates.  The key evidence consisted of video recordings taken from various sources (TVB, Apple Daily, ATV, Now TV) and photographs, as the Commissioner of Police had been refused a Production Order to obtain the original recordings and identify the makers. The trial hinged on the authenticity and reliability of this “open source” material. Tsang himself testified, identifying himself in the footage and recounting the events. The judge convicted all defendants, sentencing them to 2 years imprisonment.  The appeals centered on the admissibility of the video evidence, the identification of the officers, and the severity of the sentence.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**Prosecution:** The prosecution argued that the judge correctly applied the law in admitting the video recordings and photographs, establishing their authenticity through circumstantial evidence (witness testimony, consistency with Tsang’s account, lack of evidence of tampering). They maintained the judge was entitled to identify the officers based on the evidence presented, even without direct witness identification for all of them. They also defended the sentence as appropriate given the seriousness of the offense and the damage to public trust.

**Defense:** The defense primarily challenged the admissibility of the video evidence, arguing the judge applied the wrong legal test – requiring a “balance of probabilities” standard for authenticity rather than a “prima facie” showing. They questioned the reliability of the footage due to the lack of original recordings and the absence of testimony from the original videographers. They also argued the judge’s identification of the officers was unsafe, particularly for D4 and D7 who were not directly identified by any witnesses, relying heavily on the judge’s own observations.  Finally, they argued the sentence was excessive, considering the officers’ long service records, the stressful circumstances of the protests, and the lack of direct evidence of their active participation in the assault (for D1 and D2).



### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

This case provides a detailed examination of the law surrounding the admissibility of video evidence, particularly “open source” material obtained from the internet. The core principles established and reaffirmed by the Court of Appeal are:

*   **Authentication is Key:** The fundamental requirement for admitting video evidence is establishing its authenticity. Without authenticity, the evidence is irrelevant.
*   **The “Prima Facie” Test:** The correct test for admissibility is whether there is *prima facie* evidence of authenticity, meaning enough evidence to suggest the recording is what it purports to be, allowing the jury to assess its weight. The Court rejected the argument that a higher “balance of probabilities” standard was required. This test focuses on whether the evidence, *if believed*, would be sufficient to prove the matter beyond a reasonable doubt.
*   **Circumstantial Authentication:** Authenticity doesn’t require direct testimony from the videographer. It can be proven circumstantially through various means, including:
    *   **Chain of Custody:** Evidence establishing the recording’s history and integrity from the moment of capture to its presentation in court.
    *   **Comparison with Other Evidence:** Comparing the recording with other footage of the same event taken from different sources.
    *   **Witness Testimony:** Testimony corroborating the events depicted in the recording.
    *   **Lack of Evidence of Tampering:** Absence of evidence suggesting the recording has been altered or manipulated.
*   **The Role of the Judge as a “Gatekeeper”:** The trial judge has a crucial role in screening the evidence to ensure it meets the minimum requirements of authenticity before it is presented to the jury. This doesn’t require the judge to determine the ultimate truth of the recording, but rather to assess whether it’s reliable enough to be considered.
*   **Identification of Individuals:** Identification of individuals in video footage can be based on circumstantial evidence, such as clothing, physical features, and context. However, identification based solely on the judge’s observations without prior independent identification by a witness is less reliable and requires careful scrutiny.
*   **Weight vs. Admissibility:** Once admitted, the weight of the evidence is a matter for the jury. The judge’s role is not to determine the ultimate credibility of the recording, but to ensure it’s sufficiently reliable to be considered.
*   **Best Evidence Rule:** The Court reaffirmed that the best evidence rule (requiring the original recording) is not strictly applied to video evidence. Copies are admissible if their authenticity can be established.
*   **Joint Enterprise:**  In cases of joint enterprise, all participants are culpable, but the degree of culpability can vary, impacting sentencing.

**Novel/Controversial Points:**

*   **The “Balance of Probabilities” Debate:** The defense’s argument for a higher standard of proof for authenticity highlights the ongoing tension between ensuring reliable evidence and the practical challenges of obtaining evidence in the digital age. The Court’s reaffirmation of the “prima facie” test reflects a pragmatic approach, but it places significant reliance on the judge’s assessment of the evidence.
*   **Judge’s Own Identification:** The case raises questions about the extent to which a judge can rely on their own observations to identify individuals in video footage without prior independent identification by a witness. While not explicitly prohibited, the Court’s decision suggests this is a less secure basis for identification.
*   **Production Orders & Freedom of the Press:** The refusal of the Production Order and the rationale behind it (protecting journalistic integrity) is somewhat controversial. The Court implicitly suggests that the public availability of the footage diminishes the need for a Production Order, but this could discourage news agencies from cooperating with law enforcement in the future.



### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case

Several aspects of this case are striking:

*   **The Scale of the Evidence:** The sheer volume of video footage and photographs involved, sourced from various online platforms, is remarkable. It illustrates the pervasive nature of surveillance in modern society and the challenges of managing such a large amount of evidence in a criminal trial.
*   **The Reliance on “Open Source” Intelligence:** The case highlights the increasing reliance on publicly available information in criminal investigations. This presents both opportunities and risks, as the authenticity and reliability of such evidence can be difficult to verify.
*   **The Political Context:** The Occupy Central protests were a highly sensitive and politically charged event. The case underscores the importance of maintaining public trust in the police force and the potential consequences of police misconduct.
*   **The Lengthy Legal Battle:** The extensive appeals process, with multiple hearings and detailed judgments, demonstrates the complexity of the legal issues involved and the high stakes for all parties.
*   **The Judge’s Detailed Analysis:** The judge’s meticulous examination of the evidence, spanning 83 paragraphs and 24 pages, is noteworthy. It reflects the seriousness with which the case was treated and the judge’s commitment to ensuring a fair trial.
*   **The Disparity in Conviction Outcomes:** The quashing of convictions for D4 and D7, based on insufficient evidence of their participation, highlights the challenges of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in complex cases involving multiple defendants and limited identification evidence.
* **The Impact on Public Perception:** The case, and the subsequent appeals, were closely followed by the public and had a significant impact on perceptions of the Hong Kong police force and the rule of law.
