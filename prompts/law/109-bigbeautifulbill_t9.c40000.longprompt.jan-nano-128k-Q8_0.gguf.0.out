Okay, the user wants a summary of each section of the bill, starting with Sec. 90001. They specified that each section should be a paragraph of at most four sentences, with at least one sentence. They want it specific to parties, entities, and quantities, so I need to make sure I include all the relevant details without being vague.

First, I'll look at Sec. 90001: Border infrastructure and wall system. The bill appropriates $46.55 billion to the Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection for fiscal year 2025, which remains available until September 30, 2029. The funds are for constructing, improving, and maintaining barriers, access roads, detection tech, and ground preparation. The user mentioned the bill is from Trump, so I should note that the funding is part of his border wall initiative.

Next, Sec. 90002: Personnel, vehicles, and facilities. It's $4.1 billion for hiring more agents, $2.05 billion for retention bonuses, $855 million for vehicle repairs/leases, and $5 billion for facilities. The restriction is that funds can't be used for processing coordinators after 2028. Need to mention the specific entities: U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the exact amounts.

Sec. 90003: Detention capacity. $45 billion for single adult and family residential centers. The detention standards are set by the Secretary of Homeland Security. The definition of family residential center is important here, so I should include that. Also, the duration until removal is until the decision is made on removal.

Sec. 90004: Border security tech. $6.168 billion for tech procurement, air/marine upgrades, surveillance tech, biometric systems, screening, and initial checks for unaccompanied minors. The restriction is about surveillance towers not being tested. The definition of autonomous tech is key here, so I need to explain that.

Sec. 90005: State and local assistance. $500 million for detecting threats from drones, $625 million for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, $1 billion for the 2028 Olympics, and $450 million for Operation Stonegarden. The fund is $10 billion for state border security until 2034. Also, the restriction that states can't exercise immigration authorities.

Sec. 90006: Presidential residence protection. $300 million for reimbursement of law enforcement costs for protecting the President's residences. The funds are available for costs incurred after July 1, 2024, and must be directly related to the residences. The Secret Service is involved here.

Sec. 90007: DHS border support. $10 billion for reimbursement of costs related to border security activities. This is for the Secretary of Homeland Security's mission, so the entity is clear.

Then, Subtitle B sections. Sec. 90101: FEHB improvements. The FEHB Protection Act of 2025 adds $66 million for the Director of OPM to handle audits and verification. The user might be interested in how this affects federal employees' health benefits, so I should mention the specific amounts and the time frames.

Sec. 90102: Pandemic Response Accountability Committee. $88 million for the committee to oversee coronavirus response. The CARES Act is amended to include this bill and change the end date from 2025 to 2034.

Sec. 90103: OMB appropriation. $100 million for the Office of Management and Budget to find budget efficiencies. This is about administrative savings, so the entity is OMB and the purpose is efficiency.

I need to make sure each summary is concise, specific, and includes all the key entities and numbers. Also, check that each section is covered in one paragraph, no more than four sentences. Avoid any vague terms, stick to the exact figures and entities mentioned. Since the user is asking for a summary of changes, I should focus on what the bill adds or modifies in each section. For example, in Sec. 90001, the bill adds $46.55 billion for the wall system. In Sec. 90101, the bill amends the FEHB Act to include new funding and requirements. Make sure to mention the exact amounts and the specific entities like OPM, Secret Service, etc. Also, note the time frames and restrictions where applicable.
