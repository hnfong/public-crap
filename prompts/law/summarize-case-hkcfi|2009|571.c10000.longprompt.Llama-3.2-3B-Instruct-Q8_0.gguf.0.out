**Facts of the Case**

The case of HKSAR v. CHAN MING LOK [2009] HKCFI 571; [2009] 6 HKC 7; HCMA 225/2009 is a Hong Kong court case involving a conviction for possession of an offensive weapon. The appellant, Chan Ming Lok, was charged with possession of a knife in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse. The knife was found by a police officer, PC34497, at around 1:45 a.m. outside Nos. 9-11 Cochrane Street, Central, Hong Kong. Chan Ming Lok claimed that he had the knife for self-defence, as he lived in Shenzhen and public order was bad there, and he carried the knife to protect himself from being robbed. He also claimed that he had previously used the knife as a cook and did not know that it was not allowed to be brought into Hong Kong.

**Arguments of the Parties**

The prosecution, represented by Miss Vinci Lam, argued that the knife was an offensive weapon and that Chan Ming Lok had no lawful authority or reasonable excuse for possessing it. The prosecution relied on the definition of "offensive weapon" in section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance, which states that an article made, adapted, or suitable for causing injury to the person is an offensive weapon. The prosecution also argued that Chan Ming Lok's intention to use the knife for self-defence in Hong Kong was not a reasonable excuse, as there was no evidence of imminent danger.

Chan Ming Lok's defence team, represented by Mr. Stephen Wong, argued that the knife was not an offensive weapon because it did not fall into any of the categories defined in section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance. They relied on the case of R v. Chong Ah Choi & Others [1994] 2 HKCLR 263, which suggested that the definition of "offensive weapon" might need to be construed as if the reference to weapons "suitable for causing injury to the person" had been repealed. Chan Ming Lok also argued that he had a reasonable excuse for possessing the knife, as he intended to use it for self-defence in case he was robbed in Hong Kong.

**Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The case turned on the interpretation of the definition of "offensive weapon" in section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance. The court held that the knife was an offensive weapon because it was "suitable for causing injury to the person". The court rejected Chan Ming Lok's argument that the knife did not fall into any of the categories defined in section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance. The court also rejected the prosecution's argument that Chan Ming Lok's intention to use the knife for self-defence in Hong Kong was not a reasonable excuse, as there was no evidence of imminent danger.

The court's decision was based on the following principles:

* The definition of "offensive weapon" in section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance is broad and includes any article made, adapted, or suitable for causing injury to the person.
* The fact that the knife was carried in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse is sufficient to constitute an offence.
* The court will consider the context in which the knife was carried, including the intention of the person carrying it, when determining whether it is an offensive weapon.
* The court will not accept the argument that the knife was only used for self-defence in a different jurisdiction, as this does not justify carrying it in Hong Kong.
* The court will consider the potential for the knife to cause injury to others, even if the person carrying it intends to use it for self-defence.

The court's decision in this case may be seen as a departure from the previous case of R v. Chong Ah Choi & Others [1994] 2 HKCLR 263, which suggested that the definition of "offensive weapon" might need to be construed as if the reference to weapons "suitable for causing injury to the person" had been repealed. However, the court's decision in this case is consistent with the general principle that the definition of "offensive weapon" is broad and includes any article made, adapted, or suitable for causing injury to the person.
