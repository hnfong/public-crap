**Summary of Facts**

The case involves seven police officers (D1 to D7) who were convicted of assaulting a protester, Tsang Kin Chiu, on October 15, 2014, during the Occupy Central movement in Hong Kong. The officers were part of a Quick Response Team (QRT) A2-2, led by D1, a Detective Chief Inspector, and D2, a Detective Senior Inspector. Tsang was arrested and taken to a police station, where he was subjected to an unlawful assault by the officers. The prosecution case relied on video recordings and photographs obtained from various sources, including TVB, Apple Daily, ATV, and Now TV, which showed the assault and identified the officers involved. The defense argued that the video recordings and photographs were not authentic and that the prosecution had not met the burden of proof.

**Summary of Arguments**

The prosecution argued that the video recordings and photographs were authentic and that the prosecution had met the burden of proof. They relied on the testimony of witnesses, including Tsang, who identified himself in the recordings and photographs, and the evidence of the TVB witnesses, who testified that the recordings were not tampered with and were consistent with their recollection of events. The prosecution also argued that the judge had correctly applied the law in admitting the video recordings and photographs into evidence.

The defense argued that the video recordings and photographs were not authentic and that the prosecution had not met the burden of proof. They argued that the judge had erred in admitting the evidence and that the prosecution had not provided sufficient evidence to prove the authenticity of the recordings and photographs. The defense also argued that the judge had not properly considered the issue of compellability and had failed to order the production of the original video recordings, which were in the possession of TVB.

**Summary of Legal Principles**

The case raises several novel and controversial issues regarding the admissibility of video recordings and photographs as evidence in criminal trials. The first issue is the standard of proof required to establish the authenticity of video recordings and photographs. The prosecution argued that the judge had correctly applied the law in admitting the evidence, relying on the decision in HKSAR v Lee Chi Fai, which held that the prosecution must establish a prima facie case of authenticity. The defense argued that the judge had erred in admitting the evidence and that the prosecution had not met the burden of proof.

The second issue is the role of the trial judge in determining the admissibility of video recordings and photographs. The prosecution argued that the judge had correctly applied the law in admitting the evidence, relying on the decision in R v Robson, which held that the judge should only consider whether the evidence is prima facie authentic, and not whether it is beyond a reasonable doubt. The defense argued that the judge had erred in admitting the evidence and that the prosecution had not provided sufficient evidence to prove the authenticity of the recordings and photographs.

The third issue is the importance of considering the context in which the video recordings and photographs were taken. The prosecution argued that the judge had correctly considered the context in which the recordings and photographs were taken, including the fact that they were taken by multiple cameras and that the events depicted were consistent with the testimony of the witnesses. The defense argued that the judge had not properly considered the context in which the recordings and photographs were taken and that the prosecution had not provided sufficient evidence to prove the authenticity of the recordings and photographs.

The fourth issue is the importance of considering the chain of custody of the video recordings and photographs. The prosecution argued that the judge had correctly considered the chain of custody of the recordings and photographs, including the fact that they were downloaded from the internet and that the original recordings were in the possession of TVB. The defense argued that the judge had not properly considered the chain of custody of the recordings and photographs and that the prosecution had not provided sufficient evidence to prove the authenticity of the recordings and photographs.

The fifth issue is the importance of considering the identification of the individuals involved in the assault. The prosecution argued that the judge had correctly identified the individuals involved in the assault, relying on the testimony of the witnesses and the evidence of the video recordings and photographs. The defense argued that the judge had erred in identifying the individuals involved in the assault and that the prosecution had not provided sufficient evidence to prove their involvement.

In conclusion, the case raises several novel and controversial issues regarding the admissibility of video recordings and photographs as evidence in criminal trials. The prosecution argued that the judge had correctly applied the law in admitting the evidence, relying on the decisions in HKSAR v Lee Chi Fai and R v Robson. The defense argued that the judge had erred in admitting the evidence and that the prosecution had not met the burden of proof. The case highlights the importance of considering the context in which the video recordings and photographs were taken, the chain of custody of the recordings and photographs, and the identification of the individuals involved in the assault.

The ratio decidendi of the case is that the trial judge has a gatekeeping role in determining the admissibility of video recordings and photographs as evidence in criminal trials. The judge must consider whether the evidence is prima facie authentic and whether it is relevant to the case. The prosecution must establish a prima facie case of authenticity, which includes providing evidence of the provenance and history of the recordings and photographs. The judge must also consider the context in which the recordings and photographs were taken, including the fact that they were taken by multiple cameras and that the events depicted are consistent with the testimony of the witnesses. The judge must also consider the chain of custody of the recordings and photographs, including the fact that they were downloaded from the internet and that the original recordings were in the possession of TVB.

The case also highlights the importance of considering the identification of the individuals involved in the assault. The judge must consider the testimony of the witnesses and the evidence of the video recordings and photographs in order to identify the individuals involved in the assault. The judge must also consider the context in which the assault took place, including the fact that the officers were under great pressure and stress at the time of the assault.

In terms of the sentence, the court held that the starting point for the sentence should be 21 months' imprisonment for D3, D5, and D6, and 24 months' imprisonment for D1 and D2. However, the court reduced the sentence by 6 months for the appellants' records in serving the community as members of the Hong Kong police over many years. The court also ordered that the sentence on Charge 2 in respect of D5 should run consecutively to the sentence on Charge 1.

Overall, the case highlights the importance of considering the admissibility of video recordings and photographs as evidence in criminal trials, the role of the trial judge in determining the admissibility of such evidence, and the importance of considering the context in which the recordings and photographs were taken, the chain of custody of the recordings and photographs, and the identification of the individuals involved in the assault.
