SEC. 71117. REQUIREMENTS REGARDING WAIVER OF UNIFORM TAX REQUIREMENT 
              FOR MEDICAID PROVIDER TAX.

    (a) In General.--Section 1903(w) of the Social Security Act (42 
U.S.C. 1396b(w)) is amended--
            (1) in paragraph (3)(E), by inserting after clause (ii)(II) 
        the following new clause:
    ``(iii) For purposes of clause (ii)(I), a tax is not considered to 
be generally redistributive if any of the following conditions apply:
            ``(I) Within a permissible class, the tax rate imposed on 
        any taxpayer or tax rate group (as defined in paragraph (7)(J)) 
        explicitly defined by its relatively lower volume or percentage 
        of Medicaid taxable units (as defined in paragraph (7)(H)) is 
        lower than the tax rate imposed on any other taxpayer or tax 
        rate group explicitly defined by its relatively higher volume 
        or percentage of Medicaid taxable units.
            ``(II) Within a permissible class, the tax rate imposed on 
        any taxpayer or tax rate group (as so defined) based upon its 
        Medicaid taxable units (as so defined) is higher than the tax 
        rate imposed on any taxpayer or tax rate group based upon its 
        non-Medicaid taxable unit (as defined in paragraph (7)(I)).
            ``(III) The tax excludes or imposes a lower tax rate on a 
        taxpayer or tax rate group (as so defined) based on or defined 
        by any description that results in the same effect as described 
        in subclause (I) or (II) for a taxpayer or tax rate group. 
        Characteristics that may indicate such type of exclusion 
        include the use of terminology to establish a tax rate group--
                    ``(aa) based on payments or expenditures made under 
                the program under this title without mentioning the 
                term `Medicaid' (or any similar term) to accomplish the 
                same effect as described in subclause (I) or (II); or
                    ``(bb) that closely approximates a taxpayer or tax 
                rate group under the program under this title, to the 
                same effect as described in subclause (I) or (II).''; 
                and
            (2) in paragraph (7), by adding at the end the following 
        new subparagraphs:
            ``(H) The term `Medicaid taxable unit' means a unit that is 
        being taxed within a health care related tax that is applicable 
        to the program under this title. Such term includes a unit that 
        is used as the basis for--
                    ``(i) payment under the program under this title 
                (such as Medicaid bed days);
                    ``(ii) Medicaid revenue;
                    ``(iii) costs associated with the program under 
                this title (such as Medicaid charges, claims, or 
                expenditures); and
                    ``(iv) other units associated with the program 
                under this title, as determined by the Secretary.
            ``(I) The term `non-Medicaid taxable unit' means a unit 
        that is being taxed within a health care related tax that is 
        not applicable to the program under this title. Such term 
        includes a unit that is used as the basis for--
                    ``(i) payment by non-Medicaid payers (such as non-
                Medicaid bed days);
                    ``(ii) non-Medicaid revenue;
                    ``(iii) costs that are not associated with the 
                program under this title (such as non-Medicaid charges, 
                non-Medicaid claims, or non-Medicaid expenditures); and
                    ``(iv) other units not associated with the program 
                under this title, as determined by the Secretary.
            ``(J) The term `tax rate group' means a group of entities 
        contained within a permissible class of a health care related 
        tax that are taxed at the same rate.''.
    (b) Non-application to Territories.--The amendments made by this 
section shall only apply with respect to a State that is 1 of the 50 
States or the District of Columbia.

effect upon the date of enactment of this Act, subject to any 
applicable transition period determined appropriate by the Secretary of

SEC. 71118. REQUIRING BUDGET NEUTRALITY FOR MEDICAID DEMONSTRATION 
              PROJECTS UNDER SECTION 1115.

    (a) In General.--Section 1115 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1315) is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(g) Requirement of Budget Neutrality for Medicaid Demonstration 
Projects.--
            ``(1) In general.--Beginning January 1 2027, the Secretary 
        may not approve an application for (or renewal or amendment of) 
        an experimental, pilot, or demonstration project undertaken 
        under subsection (a) to promote the objectives of title XIX in 
        a State (in this subsection referred to as a `Medicaid 
        demonstration project') unless the Chief Actuary for the 
        Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services certifies that such 
        project, or, in the case of a renewal, the duration of the 
        preceding waiver, is not expected to result in an increase in 
        the amount of Federal expenditures compared to the amount that 
        such expenditures would otherwise be in the absence of such 
        project. For purposes of this subsection, expenditures for the 
        coverage of populations and services that the State could have 
        otherwise provided through its Medicaid State plan or other 
        authority under title XIX, including expenditures that could be 
        made under such authority but for the provision of such 
        services at a different site of service than authorized under 
        such State plan or other authority, shall be considered 
        expenditures in the absence of such a project.
            ``(2) Treatment of savings.--In the event that expenditures 
        with respect to a State under a Medicaid demonstration project 
        are, during an approval period for such project, less than the 
        amount of such expenditures that would have otherwise been made 
        in the absence of such project, the Secretary shall specify the 
        methodology to be used with respect to the subsequent approval 
        period for such project for purposes of taking the difference 
        between such expenditures into account.''.
    (b) Implementation Funding.--For the purposes of carrying out the 
provisions of, and the amendments made by, this section, there are 
appropriated, out of any monies in the Treasury not otherwise 
appropriated, to the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services, $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2026 and 2027, 
to remain available until expended.
