### TASK 1: Summary of the Facts

The case involves President Trump’s imposition of tariffs on imports from various countries under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The President declared national emergencies related to drug trafficking and trade deficits, invoking IEEPA to impose tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China. The plaintiffs, including businesses and states, challenged these tariffs as exceeding the President’s authority under IEEPA. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the tariffs, but the Supreme Court reversed, holding that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs. The Court emphasized that IEEPA’s text, history, and precedent do not support the President’s tariff authority. The Court held that IEEPA’s “regulate importation” language does not encompass tariffs, and that the major questions doctrine applies here, requiring clear congressional authorization for such significant economic and political action. The Court concluded that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs, and that the major questions doctrine applies, requiring clear congressional authorization for such significant economic and political action.
