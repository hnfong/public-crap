Okay, let's tackle this case summary. First, I need to go through the provided judgment and extract the key facts. The case involves seven police officers (appellants) convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm against Tsang during the 2014 Occupy Central protests. The main issue revolves around the admissibility of open-source video and photographic evidence from media outlets like TVB and Apple Daily. The prosecution relied heavily on this evidence, while the defense argued about authenticity and provenance.

For the first task, summarizing the facts, I should mention the context of the protests, the specific incident where Tsang was assaulted, the use of video evidence, and the convictions. The appellants were part of a police team that restrained Tsang, then carried him to a substation where he was beaten. The trial court admitted the media evidence, leading to convictions.

Next, the arguments of the parties. The prosecution argued that the video and photo evidence was authentic and relevant, supported by Tsang's testimony and police witnesses. The defense contested the authenticity, claiming the evidence wasn't properly authenticated, and that the trial judge misapplied the standard of proof for admissibility (balance of probabilities vs. prima facie).

For the legal principles, the key points are about evidence admissibility, especially for video recordings. The court discussed the test for admissibility: whether the evidence is relevant and prima facie authentic. The ratio here is that the trial judge correctly applied the prima facie standard, not the balance of probabilities. The court also emphasized that authentication can be circumstantial and that the judge's role as a gatekeeper ensures evidence is relevant and authentic before being presented to the jury. The controversial point might be the court's affirmation of the prima facie test over the balance of probabilities, which was a point of contention in the case.

Lastly, something striking about the case: the high-profile nature of the incident during the Occupy Central protests, the involvement of police officers in the assault, and the reliance on open-source media evidence. The case also highlights the challenges in authenticating digital evidence in criminal trials, especially when original sources aren't available. The fact that two appellants (D4 and D7) were acquitted on appeal due to insufficient identification is notable, showing the importance of proper identification in such cases.

I need to make sure each section is concise but covers all necessary points. Let me structure each part step by step, ensuring clarity and completeness without getting bogged down in too many details.

### 1. Summary of the Facts  
In **HKSAR v Wong Cho Shing and Others**, seven Hong Kong police officers (appellants) were convicted of jointly assaulting Tsang Kin Chiu during the 2014 Occupy Central protests. The incident occurred during "Operation Solarpeak," a police operation to clear protesters. Tsang was seen splashing liquid on police officers, leading to his restraint. After being subdued, Tsang was handed over to the appellants, who allegedly carried him to a substation, where he was subjected to an unlawful assault involving kicks, stamps, and beatings while restrained. The prosecution relied heavily on open-source video footage and photographs from media outlets (e.g., TVB, Apple Daily, ATV) to prove the assault. Tsang also testified about the events, including a separate common assault by one officer (D5) in a police station. The trial judge admitted the media evidence as authentic and relevant, leading to convictions for all appellants, with sentences of 2 years’ imprisonment each (D5 received an additional 1 month for the common assault).

### 2. Arguments of the Parties  
**Prosecution**:  
- Argued that the video and photographic evidence was **authentic and relevant**, supported by Tsang’s testimony and police witnesses.  
- Emphasized that the trial judge correctly applied the **prima facie standard** for admissibility, requiring only that the evidence was "likely authentic" to be admitted, with authenticity assessed by the jury.  
- Highlighted circumstantial evidence (e.g., consistency between Tsang’s account and the footage, witness identifications of officers in earlier stages of the incident) to establish the provenance of the media material.  

**Defense**:  
- Challenged the **admissibility** of the media evidence, claiming insufficient proof of authenticity. Argued the prosecution failed to meet the **balance of probabilities standard** for authentication, particularly since original video recordings were not produced (due to a rejected Production Order application).  
- Contended the trial judge erred in relying on the videos’ continuity and comparisons with other footage to establish authenticity, as this usurped the jury’s role.  
- Highlighted gaps in identification evidence for two appellants (D4 and D7), arguing their convictions were unsafe due to lack of direct visual or testimonial evidence linking them to the assault.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The case turned on **evidentiary principles governing the admissibility of video and photographic evidence**, particularly open-source material from media outlets. Key legal principles include:  

#### **A. Test for Admissibility of Video Evidence**  
- **Prima Facie Standard**: The court affirmed that evidence is admissible if it is **relevant** and there is **prima facie proof of authenticity**. This requires the prosecution to show, on a balance of probabilities, that the evidence is likely authentic to the extent it can be considered by the jury. The trial judge correctly applied this standard, rejecting the defense’s argument that a higher threshold (balance of probabilities) was required for admissibility itself.  
- **Circumstantial Authentication**: The court held that authenticity can be proven circumstantially (e.g., consistency with witness accounts, cross-referencing with other footage, and contextual plausibility). The judge’s reliance on Tsang’s testimony and comparisons between different video sources was valid.  

#### **B. Role of the Trial Judge as "Gatekeeper"**  
- The judge’s role is to ensure evidence is **relevant and minimally authentic** before admission, but questions of weight and ultimate authenticity are for the jury. The court rejected the defense’s claim that the judge overstepped by assessing continuity and editing of footage, as this was part of determining relevance and prima facie authenticity.  

#### **C. Identification of Defendants**  
- **Visual Identification**: The court upheld the judge’s authority to make **own identifications** of defendants from video footage, provided the reasoning is thorough and supported by observable features (e.g., clothing, accessories). This was critical for identifying most appellants, as many were not directly identified by witnesses.  
- **Contextual Inference**: The judge’s inference that senior officers (D1 and D2) participated in the assault by failing to intervene was upheld, as their roles and presence at the scene made their involvement "inherently probable."  

#### **D. Controversial or Novel Points**  
- **Rejection of "Balance of Probabilities" for Admissibility**: The court explicitly rejected the defense’s argument that the **Robson test** (from English law) requiring authentication on the balance of probabilities applied. Instead, it endorsed the **Murphy/Lee Chi Fai approach**, which uses a prima facie standard. This distinction is critical and novel in clarifying Hong Kong’s evidentiary standards.  
- **Use of Open-Source Media**: The case underscores the challenges and legal frameworks for admitting widely disseminated but unverified media evidence, particularly when original sources are inaccessible (e.g., due to a denied Production Order).  
- **Identification of Non-Identifiable Appellants**: The court’s reversal of D4 and D7’s convictions highlighted the **risks of relying solely on the judge’s visual identification** without corroborating evidence. Their lack of prior identification in footage or testimonial links rendered their convictions unsafe.

### 4. Striking or Unusual Aspects of the Case  
- **High-Profile Context**: The case arose from the **Occupy Central protests**, a pivotal moment in Hong Kong’s history, making the outcome politically and socially significant. The conviction of police officers for brutality during the protests drew intense public scrutiny.  
- **Reliance on Open-Source Evidence**: The prosecution’s case hinged on media footage and photographs, reflecting modern challenges in criminal trials where digital evidence is central but often contested for authenticity.  
- **Reversal of Two Convictions**: The appellate court’s decision to overturn D4 and D7’s convictions due to insufficient identification evidence was striking, emphasizing the **importance of robust identification procedures** even in cases with overwhelming circumstantial context.  
- **Judicial Identification Authority**: The court’s affirmation of a judge’s power to make **own identifications** from video evidence, while controversial, reflects the practical realities of complex trials where witnesses may fail to identify defendants.  
- **Production Order Controversy**: The trial judge’s refusal to compel media outlets to produce original footage (despite its relevance) was a critical procedural flaw, yet the appellate court found it did not render the trial unfair due to the judge’s thorough authentication process.  

This case remains a landmark in Hong Kong’s jurisprudence on evidentiary standards for digital media and the limits of judicial discretion in identification cases. [end of text]
