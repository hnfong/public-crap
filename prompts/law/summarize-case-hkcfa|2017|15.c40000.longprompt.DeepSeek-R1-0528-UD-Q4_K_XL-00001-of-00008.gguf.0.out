Hmm, the user has provided a detailed Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal judgment and asked me to analyze it in four specific parts. This is a complex legal document involving bribery laws, so I need to carefully extract the key elements.

First, I'll tackle the facts: Stephen Chan was TVB's General Manager who hosted a popular show "Be My Guest." For a New Year's Eve event co-produced by TVB and Olympian City shopping mall, Chan appeared in a special live edition of his show as Olympian City's paid guest through his agent Tseng, without seeking TVB's permission as required by his contract. Both were charged under Prevention of Bribery Ordinance section 9.

For the arguments: The prosecution claimed Chan's appearance related to TVB's business since it was part of their broadcast. The defense argued it was personal moonlighting unrelated to TVB's affairs. The trial judge initially acquitted them, but the Court of Appeal reversed this.

The legal principles section requires deep analysis. The key ratio is Ribeiro PJ's interpretation that section 9 requires the agent's act to be "aimed at" the principal in a way that undermines the agency relationship. This novel interpretation adds an element of detriment to the principal's interests, differing from the Court of Appeal's broader view. The judgment also clarifies mens rea requirements and reasonable excuse defenses in detail.

What's striking is how the CFA unanimously allowed the appeal but through different reasoning paths - Ribeiro finding no section 9 offense at all, while Tang PJ found a reasonable excuse defense. The case shows judicial creativity in limiting anti-bribery laws to prevent over-criminalization of benign commercial arrangements.

I should present this clearly, using plain language while maintaining legal precision. The user seems knowledgeable about law (given the technical request), so I'll ensure thorough coverage of the nuanced ratio about "aimed at" and detriment requirements, which reshaped Hong Kong's bribery jurisprudence.

### 1. Brief Summary of Facts  
Stephen Chan Chi Wan, General Manager (Broadcasting) at TVB, hosted the popular show "Be My Guest" voluntarily without extra pay. For a 2009 New Year’s Eve countdown event co-produced by TVB and Olympian City (OC), Chan appeared in a live segment of his show as OC’s paid guest, facilitated by his agent Tseng Pei Kun (director of Idea Empire Advertising). OC paid Tseng’s company $160,000, of which Chan received $112,000. Chan did not seek TVB’s permission for this paid external work, though TVB knew of his participation. Both Chan and Tseng were charged under Section 9 of Hong Kong’s Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO) for conspiracy and substantive offenses related to Chan accepting an advantage (the fee) "in relation to his principal’s [TVB’s] affairs or business."

### 2. Summary of Arguments  
- **Prosecution (Secretary for Justice)**:  
  Argued Chan’s appearance was integral to TVB’s broadcast, directly "related to" TVB’s business. His role boosted audience ratings, and refusal could harm TVB’s contract with OC. Thus, accepting payment without permission violated Section 9. Tseng, as the offeror, was equally liable.  
- **Defense (Chan and Tseng)**:  
  Contended Chan acted as a private "celebrity," not in his capacity as TVB’s agent. The appearance was unrelated to TVB’s affairs—merely "moonlighting" that benefited TVB at no cost. No conflict of interest or detriment to TVB existed. Even if Section 9 applied, Chan had a "reasonable excuse" (TVB’s tacit awareness of his role).  

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) unanimously quashed the convictions, but diverged on reasoning. The core ratio centers on **Section 9 POBO interpretation**:  

#### A. Elements of Section 9 Offense  
- **Actus Reus**: The agent’s act/forbearance must be "in relation to his principal’s affairs or business." Following *Ch’ng Poh* [1997], this requires:  
  - The act must be **"aimed at" the principal** and **intended to "influence or affect" the principal’s affairs**.  
  - It must **undermine the agency relationship’s integrity**, causing detriment (e.g., conflict of interest, reputational risk, or breach of trust). Mere "relation" to the principal’s business is insufficient.  
- **Mens Rea**:  
  - For **agents accepting advantages**: Knowledge/belief the advantage is an inducement/reward for an act aimed at influencing the principal.  
  - For **offerors**: Intention that the advantage incentivize such an act.  

#### B. Novel/Controversial Interpretations  
- **Detriment Requirement (Ribeiro PJ, majority)**:  
  Section 9 targets acts that **subvert the agency relationship to the principal’s detriment**. Detriment includes:  
  - Economic harm (e.g., secret commissions),  
  - Reputational damage, or  
  - Erosion of trust/loyalty (e.g., divulging confidential data).  
  *Chan’s act was beneficial to TVB (free publicity, no conflict), thus outside Section 9.*  
- **"Aimed at" the Principal (Clarification of *Ch’ng Poh*)**:  
  Rejected the Court of Appeal’s broad "causal relationship" test. An act is only "in relation to" the principal’s affairs if it is **directed at involving the principal** (e.g., influencing decisions or operations). Moonlighting per se is not covered.  
- **Reasonable Excuse (Tang PJ, concurring)**:  
  Even if Section 9 applied, Chan had a "reasonable excuse": TVB knew of his participation and likely expected payment. Lack of formal permission was procedural, not corrupt.  

#### C. Conspiracy Charges & Burden of Proof  
- **Reverse Onus (Section 24 POBO)**: Does **not apply to conspiracy charges**. The prosecution must prove all elements (including lack of reasonable excuse) beyond doubt.  
- **Section 12A POBO**: Rules of evidence for substantive offenses (e.g., Section 24’s reverse onus) do not extend to conspiracy.  

### 4. Striking/Unusual Aspects  
1. **Judicial Divergence on Key Issues**:  
   - Ribeiro PJ held Chan’s act **fell outside Section 9 entirely** (no detriment to TVB).  
   - Tang PJ found the act **was within Section 9** but excused by "reasonable excuse" (TVB’s implied consent).  
   Both reached the same outcome (acquittal) via opposing logic, highlighting tensions in interpreting anti-corruption laws.  

2. **Broad Implications for Anti-Corruption Law**:  
   - The "detriment" requirement narrows Section 9’s scope, shielding benign commercial arrangements (e.g., undisclosed but beneficial moonlighting) from prosecution. This contrasts with the Court of Appeal’s expansive view that *any* connection to the principal’s business suffices.  

3. **Cultural Context**:  
   - The case reflects Hong Kong’s strict anti-corruption ethos but also pragmatic limits: Chan, a celebrity, blurred lines between employment and personal brand. The CFA prioritized preventing over-criminalization, noting TVB *benefited* from his appearance.  

4. **Procedural Complexity**:  
   - The case underwent **two appeals**, a retrial, and two Court of Final Appeal hearings—illustrating the challenges in defining "corruption" in evolving professional landscapes (e.g., media/entertainment).  

**Final Remark**: The CFA’s insistence on **proving detriment to the agency relationship** sets a nuanced precedent, balancing anti-bribery rigor with fairness to agents whose acts align with their principal’s interests. [end of text]
