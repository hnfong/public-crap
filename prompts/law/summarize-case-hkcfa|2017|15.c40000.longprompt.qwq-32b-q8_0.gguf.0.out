Okay, let's tackle this case summary. First, I need to understand the facts. The case is about two people, Stephen Chan and Tseng Pei Kun, who were charged under the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance in Hong Kong. Chan was a TVB employee who hosted a popular talk show, "Be My Guest." Tseng was his agent. 

The key event was a New Year's Eve Countdown show produced by TVB and sponsored by Olympian City. They added a live episode of Chan's show as part of the event. Olympian City paid Tseng's company to get Chan and another artist to participate. Chan received payment without TVB's approval, even though his contract required it. The trial court acquitted them, but the Court of Appeal reversed that, leading to fines. The appellants then took it to the Court of Final Appeal.

Now, the arguments. The prosecution argued that Chan's acceptance of payment for appearing in the show was an act related to TVB's business, thus a bribe under section 9. The defense probably said it was just moonlighting, not affecting TVB's interests, and thus not an offense.

For the legal principles, the main issue is the interpretation of section 9 of the POBO. The Court of Final Appeal had to determine if the act (Chan appearing) was "in relation to his principal's affairs or business." The Privy Council case Ch’ng Poh was key here, which required the act to influence or affect the principal's business. The Court of Appeal had taken a broader view, but the Final Appeal judges disagreed, saying the act must be adverse to the principal's interests. They emphasized that the offense targets corrupt transactions undermining the agency relationship, not just any payment without permission.

The controversial point is whether the act needed to harm the principal's interests. The Court of Final Appeal said yes, whereas the Court of Appeal thought any influence sufficed. The Final Appeal also discussed the "reasonable excuse" defense, finding that Chan's belief in TVB's implicit consent was reasonable.

What's striking? The case turned on a nuanced interpretation of statutory language, with the court emphasizing that the law targets corruption, not mere contractual breaches. The fact that a popular TV host's side gig led to such a high-level legal battle is notable. Also, the court's focus on the integrity of the agency relationship over strict liability is a key takeaway.

### 1. Summary of the Facts  
Stephen Chan Chi Wan ("Chan"), a TVB employee in an administrative role, hosted a popular pay-channel talk show, *Be My Guest*. Tseng Pei Kun ("Tseng"), acting as Chan’s agent, arranged external commercial engagements for him. In late 2009, TVB collaborated with Olympian City (OC) to produce a New Year’s Eve Countdown show. OC proposed adding a live episode of *Be My Guest* as part of the event. OC paid Tseng’s company, IEAP, $160,000 for Chan and another artist to participate. Chan received $112,000 without TVB’s approval, violating his employment contract’s requirement for prior consent. Though TVB knew of Chan’s involvement, it did not authorize the payment.  

The prosecution charged both men under Section 9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO), alleging Chan (as TVB’s agent) accepted an advantage ($112,000) as an inducement for participating in the show, which related to TVB’s business. The trial court acquitted them, but the Court of Appeal reversed this decision, leading to fines. The case reached the Court of Final Appeal (CFA), which ultimately quashed the convictions.

### 2. Summary of the Parties’ Arguments  
**Prosecution’s Case:**  
- Chan’s acceptance of payment for appearing in the *Be My Guest* segment of the Countdown show constituted an act "in relation to TVB’s affairs or business" under POBO Section 9.  
- The act influenced TVB’s business (e.g., boosting ratings, avoiding contractual issues with OC), even if beneficial.  
- The defense of "reasonable excuse" failed because Chan’s contractual obligation to seek approval negated any justification.  

**Defense’s Case:**  
- Chan’s appearance was a personal commercial engagement ("moonlighting") unrelated to TVB’s business. The show’s inclusion was OC’s initiative, not TVB’s requirement.  
- The payment did not harm TVB; it enhanced its reputation and ratings.  
- Chan reasonably believed TVB implicitly consented, given its awareness of his participation. This constituted a "reasonable excuse" under Section 9.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  

#### **Core Issue: Interpretation of POBO Section 9**  
Section 9 criminalizes transactions where an agent (or third party) solicits, accepts, or offers an advantage as an inducement or reward for acts "in relation to the principal’s affairs or business." The CFA focused on two key questions:  
1. **Mens rea and the scope of "in relation to the principal’s affairs or business."**  
2. **The defense of "reasonable excuse."**  

---

#### **1. Mens Rea and the Restrictive Interpretation of "In Relation To"**  
The CFA emphasized that the phrase "in relation to" must be interpreted restrictively, as per the Privy Council’s ruling in *Ch’ng Poh* (1997). The act must:  
- **Be aimed at the principal’s business** and intended to **influence or affect it**, even if indirectly.  
- **Undermine the integrity of the agency relationship**, typically by acting against the principal’s interests (e.g., causing reputational or financial harm).  

**Controversial Points:**  
- **Adverse Impact Requirement:** The CFA held that the act must harm or risk harming the principal’s interests. The Court of Appeal’s broader view—that any influence sufficed—was rejected. For example, Chan’s beneficial appearance still required proof of harm to TVB’s interests, which was absent.  
- **Agent’s Subjective Knowledge:** The agent must know or believe the advantage was provided as an inducement/reward for an act aimed at the principal’s business. Here, Chan lacked such intent; he viewed the payment as for his celebrity role, not his TVB duties.  

---

#### **2. The Defense of "Reasonable Excuse"**  
The CFA clarified that "reasonable excuse" is an objective defense, requiring the accused to show circumstances justifying the act despite lacking permission. Key points:  
- **Context Matters:** Chan’s belief that TVB implicitly consented (given its awareness and lack of objection) was reasonable. TVB’s contractual requirement to seek approval did not negate this if the principal’s conduct suggested tolerance.  
- **No Prejudice Required:** The defense does not depend on proving the principal’s interests were unharmed. Instead, it focuses on whether the accused’s actions were objectively justifiable under the circumstances.  

**Novelty/Controversy:**  
- The CFA distinguished between **contractual obligations** (e.g., seeking approval) and **statutory offenses** (Section 9). Breaching a contract alone does not equate to corruption unless the act meets the restrictive "in relation to" test.  
- The court’s emphasis on **implicit consent** expanded the scope of "reasonable excuse," allowing reliance on the principal’s conduct rather than explicit permission.  

---

#### **3. Conspiracy Charge and Burden of Proof**  
The CFA addressed whether Section 24 (placing the burden of proving "reasonable excuse" on the accused) applied to conspiracy charges. It held:  
- Conspiracy under POBO Section 9 is a **common law/statutory offense** (not a POBO offense), so Section 24’s reverse burden does not apply.  
- The prosecution must prove the conspiracy necessarily led to a Section 9 offense **without any reasonable excuse**. The Court of Appeal’s failure to negate this was another flaw in its reasoning.

### 4. Striking or Unusual Aspects of the Case  
- **A Popular TV Host’s Side Gig Becomes a Landmark Case:** The case involved a celebrity’s commercial activities, highlighting how everyday contractual breaches can escalate into complex legal battles over corruption.  
- **Contradictory Outcomes:** The Court of Appeal’s decision to convict despite the act benefiting TVB seemed to invert the purpose of anti-bribery laws. The CFA’s reversal underscored the need for strict alignment between statutory language and public policy.  
- **Implicit Consent as a Defense:** The court’s recognition of implicit consent (via the principal’s inaction) as a "reasonable excuse" is a nuanced departure from strict liability principles, emphasizing contextual fairness.  
- **Statutory Interpretation Over Policy:** The CFA prioritized the restrictive interpretation of "in relation to," rejecting the prosecution’s broad reading that could criminalize innocuous acts. This reinforced the principle that anti-corruption laws must target genuine corruption, not technical breaches.  

The case remains a pivotal example of how Hong Kong’s courts balance statutory text, legislative intent, and real-world consequences in anti-corruption jurisprudence. [end of text]
