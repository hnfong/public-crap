### 1. Summary of Facts

This case concerns the constitutionality of the **New Territories Small House Policy** (the "Small House Policy") in Hong Kong. Implemented in 1972, the policy allows male indigenous villagers of the New Territories (NTIIs) to apply for a small house grant once in their lifetime. The policy is inherently discriminatory on two grounds: it restricts eligibility to males descended through the male line from a resident in 1898, and it restricts eligibility to indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories, excluding non-indigenous residents.

The applicants, Mr. Martin Lee and another, challenged the policy via judicial review, arguing that it violated:
*   **Article 25** of the Basic Law (BL25) and **Article 22** of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights (BOR22) regarding equality and non-discrimination based on sex and social origin/birth.
*   **Article 7** of the Basic Law regarding the government's duty to manage land for the benefit of all residents.

The case hinged on **Article 40** of the Basic Law, which states: "The lawful traditional rights and interests of the indigenous inhabitants of the 'New Territories' shall be protected by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region."

The High Court (Chow J) initially found the policy discriminatory and unconstitutional under BL25 and BOR22. However, the Judge held that the policy was partially constitutional because the "Ding Rights" (the right to build a small house) constituted "lawful traditional rights and interests" under BL40, but only to the extent of **free building licences** on private land. The Judge ruled that **private treaty grants** (Government land) and **land exchanges** were not "traditional" enough to be protected by BL40 and were therefore unconstitutional.

All parties appealed to the Court of Appeal. The core dispute was whether the *entire* Small House Policy, including private treaty grants and exchanges, was protected by BL40, thereby rendering it constitutional despite its discriminatory nature.

### 2. Summary of Arguments

**The Applicants (Challenging the Policy):**
*   **Discrimination:** The policy is inherently discriminatory based on sex and social origin, violating BL25 and BOR22.
*   **Interpretation of BL40:** Article 40 only protects rights that are "lawful" and "traditional." The applicants argued that "lawful" means lawful under the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights. Since the policy discriminates, it cannot be "lawful" under BL40.
*   **Not a "Right":** The Ding Rights are merely a discretionary government policy to *apply* for a grant, not a substantive "right or interest" protected by the Constitution.
*   **Not "Traditional":** The current policy (especially private treaty grants and exchanges) is not traceable to pre-1898 customs. The pre-1898 system involved building on one's own land, whereas the current policy allows acquiring Government land.
*   **Standing and Delay:** The applicants lacked standing and brought the case with an unexplained, phenomenal delay (over 20 years after the Basic Law came into force).

**The Respondents and Interested Party (Defending the Policy):**
*   **BL40 Protection:** The Ding Rights are "lawful traditional rights and interests" under BL40. The term "lawful" in BL40 is descriptive of rights recognized as lawful at the time of the Basic Law's drafting (1990), not subject to later constitutional challenges based on equality.
*   **Historical Continuity:** The policy is a continuation of customs recognized by the Colonial Government since 1898. Private treaty grants and exchanges are traceable to pre-1898 customs or are necessary administrative mechanisms to give effect to the traditional right.
*   **Coherence with Joint Declaration:** The Joint Declaration and Annex III (incorporated into BL120 and BL122) explicitly intended to preserve small house grants and the associated rent concessions for male descendants, implying the entire policy must be protected.
*   **CEDAW Reservations:** The UK and PRC governments entered reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) specifically to allow these discriminatory laws to continue. BL40 must be read consistently with these reservations.
*   **Standing and Delay:** The applicants had no personal interest in the land and waited too long to sue, causing prejudice to the administration and third parties who relied on the policy.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The Court of Appeal unanimously allowed the appeals, declaring the **entire Small House Policy constitutional**. The judgment establishes several profound legal principles regarding the interpretation of the Basic Law, the nature of "traditional rights," and the relationship between equality provisions and specific constitutional protections.

**A. The Interpretation of "Lawful Traditional Rights and Interests" in Article 40**
The Court rejected the High Court's "tracing exercise" which required rights to be traced back to the exact form of customs existing in 1898. Instead, the Court adopted a **factual and historical context approach** focused on the state of affairs at the time the Basic Law was promulgated (April 1990).
*   **"Traditional":** A right is "traditional" if it is recognized as such in the Hong Kong legal system at the time of the Basic Law's drafting. It does not need to be identical to pre-1898 customs, provided it retains the **essential features** of those customs. The Court found that the Ding Rights, despite evolving from free building licences to include private treaty grants and exchanges, retained the core essence of the pre-1898 custom: the right of male indigenous villagers to build a house for their own occupation.
*   **"Lawful":** The term "lawful" in BL40 does not mean "lawful under the Basic Law's equality provisions" (BL25/BOR22). Rather, it means **lawful under the domestic legal system at the time of the Basic Law's drafting**. Since the Small House Policy had been recognized as lawful by the Colonial Government and the HKSAR government since 1898, and had never been successfully challenged in court prior to 1997, it was "lawful" in the sense required by BL40. The Court held that BL40 was intended to "entrench" these rights, shielding them from being struck down by the equality provisions.

**B. The Shielding Effect of Article 40 against Equality Provisions**
The most significant legal principle established is that **Article 40 operates as a specific exception to the general equality provisions (BL25 and BOR22).**
*   The Court reasoned that if the Ding Rights were subject to challenge under BL25 or BOR22, the protection promised by BL40 would be rendered illusory.
*   The Court emphasized the **Coherence Principle**: The Basic Law must be read as a coherent whole. BL40 must be read in conjunction with **BL120** and **BL122**, which give effect to Annex III of the Joint Declaration. Annex III explicitly agreed to preserve small house grants and rent concessions for male descendants. To strike down the policy under equality laws would contradict the fundamental agreement between the UK and PRC governments regarding the continuity of land rights in the New Territories.
*   Furthermore, the Court noted the **CEDAW Reservations**. Both the UK and PRC governments entered reservations to the CEDAW convention specifically to preserve laws allowing male indigenous villagers to exercise property rights. The Court held that BL40 must be interpreted consistently with these international reservations, effectively barring discrimination challenges based on sex, and by necessary implication, based on social origin or birth.

**C. The Nature of the "Ding Right" as a Constitutional Right**
The Court rejected the argument that the Ding Right was merely a discretionary administrative privilege.
*   The Court held that the Small House Policy creates a **legitimate expectation** and a legal obligation on the government to process applications according to the policy.
*   Consequently, an eligible NTII has a **right to have their application determined** in accordance with the policy. This right to determination constitutes a "right or interest" within the meaning of BL40.
*   The Court clarified that the evolution of the policy (from free building licences to private treaty grants and exchanges) did not break the continuity of the right. Private treaty grants were found to be traceable to the pre-1898 custom of acquiring land for building, and exchanges were merely a derivative mechanism to facilitate the primary right.

**D. Discretionary Policy vs. Constitutional Right**
The judgment clarifies that while the *grant* itself is discretionary in the sense that the government must verify eligibility, the *right to apply* and have that application considered under the specific policy is a protected constitutional interest. The Court found that the policy's discriminatory nature (male-only, indigenous-only) was an inherent feature of the "traditional right" that the drafters of the Basic Law intended to protect, not a flaw to be corrected by the courts.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

**1. Constitutionalizing Discrimination:**
The most striking aspect of this case is the explicit judicial affirmation that the Basic Law **constitutionally protects a policy that is inherently discriminatory** based on sex and birth. The Court of Appeal did not merely find a "justification" for the discrimination; it ruled that the discrimination is an integral part of a "traditional right" that the Constitution *mandates* the government to protect. This creates a unique legal anomaly where a specific group (male indigenous villagers) enjoys a constitutional right to a benefit that is explicitly denied to others (women and non-indigenous residents) based on their status, and this inequality is shielded from the general equality clauses of the Basic Law.

**2. The "Freezing" of History:**
The judgment effectively "freezes" the legal status of the New Territories indigenous inhabitants as of April 1990. By defining "traditional" rights based on the state of affairs at the time of the Basic Law's drafting rather than a strict historical tracing to 1898, the Court allowed the evolution of the policy (e.g., the shift to private treaty grants) to be protected, provided the "essential feature" remained. This prevents the courts from updating the policy to align with modern human rights standards regarding gender equality or non-discrimination.

**3. The Role of International Reservations:**
The Court placed significant weight on the **CEDAW reservations** made by the UK and PRC governments. It is remarkable that the Court used an international treaty reservation (which was technically an agreement between two foreign powers regarding Hong Kong) to interpret the domestic Constitution (Basic Law) in a way that overrides the Bill of Rights. This highlights the unique "internationalized" nature of Hong Kong's constitutional framework, where international agreements made prior to 1997 continue to dictate the scope of domestic rights.

**4. The "Phenomenal" Delay:**
The Court's commentary on the delay is notable. The applicants waited over 20 years after the Basic Law came into force (and over 40 years after the policy was introduced) to challenge it. The Court described the delay as "phenomenal" and noted that the prejudice caused to the administration and the thousands of villagers who had relied on the policy was substantial. This underscores the tension between the right to challenge unconstitutional laws and the public interest in legal certainty and the stability of long-standing administrative policies.

**5. The "Ding" (Male) Right:**
The term "Ding Rights" (丁權) itself is a cultural and legal curiosity. The judgment reinforces a system where a man's right to build a house is tied to his lineage from 1898. The Court's refusal to strike this down, despite the clear gender discrimination, preserves a patriarchal custom within the modern constitutional order of Hong Kong, creating a distinct legal regime for the New Territories that stands in stark contrast to the rest of the city.
