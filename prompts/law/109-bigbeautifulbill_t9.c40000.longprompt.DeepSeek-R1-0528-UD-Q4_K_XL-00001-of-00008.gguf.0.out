Alright, let me tackle this user request. They want a concise summary of each section in this bill, specifically Sec. 90001 onwards. The bill seems to be a Homeland Security funding package with border security as a major focus. 

First, I'll scan each section to identify key elements: funding amounts, responsible agencies, and specific purposes. For Sec. 90001, it's $46.55B for border wall infrastructure - I'll note the components like barriers and tech. 

Sec. 90002 has multiple allocations: $4.1B for hiring agents, $2B for bonuses, etc. The restriction on processing coordinators after 2028 seems important to include. 

Detention funding in Sec. 90003 is straightforward - $45B for adult and family detention centers. The definition of family units here is legally precise so I'll capture that. 

Sec. 90004's tech funding is complex with 8 sub-purposes. The autonomous surveillance restriction is crucial. I'll define "autonomous" briefly as in the bill. 

State grants in Sec. 90005 need careful breakdown: drone defense, World Cup/Olympics security, and the new $10B border fund for states. The eligibility backdating to 2021 is significant. 

Presidential protection in Sec. 90006 is niche but clear - $300M for extra security costs at private residences. The FEMA admin cap is a detail worth keeping. 

The DHS slush fund in Sec. 90007 is vague but high-value at $10B - I'll flag its broad "border support" purpose. 

Switching to governmental affairs: FEHB reforms in Sec. 90101 involve eligibility verification and $66M audit funding. The Pandemic Committee extension to 2034 in Sec. 90102 and OMB's $100M efficiency hunt in Sec. 90103 round it out. 

User likely wants this for policy analysis or quick reference. The Trump mention suggests political context, but I'll stay neutral. Since they emphasize conciseness, I'll compress each section to 1-4 sentences max, preserving quantities and restrictions. No fluff - just what each section materially does.
