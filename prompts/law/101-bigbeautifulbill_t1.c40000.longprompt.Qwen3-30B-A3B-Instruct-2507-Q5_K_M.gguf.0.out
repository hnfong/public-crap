**Sec. 10101. Re-evaluation of Thrifty Food Plan.**  
The Thrifty Food Plan (TFP) is redefined to use the 2021 report and future updates, with cost adjustments based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the most recent 12-month period ending in June, effective October 1, 2025. The TFP cost will be the basis for uniform SNAP allotments regardless of household composition, and household size adjustments are standardized (e.g., 1-person: 30%, 4-person: 100%, 8-person: 180%). Re-evaluation of market baskets is permitted no earlier than October 1, 2027, but must be cost-neutral, preventing any increase in the TFP cost. Hawaii, Alaska (urban and rural), Guam, and the Virgin Islands receive cost adjustments reflecting local food prices, but not exceeding those in the 50 states and D.C.

**Sec. 10102. Modifications to SNAP Work Requirements for Able-Bodied Adults.**  
The work requirement exceptions now include pregnant women, Indian/Urban Indian individuals, and California Indians, expanding eligibility beyond prior categories. Noncontiguous states (e.g., Alaska, Hawaii) with unemployment rates at or above 1.5 times the national average are exempt from work requirements, with the definition excluding Guam and the Virgin Islands. The Secretary may grant a temporary exemption (through December 31, 2028) to noncontiguous states demonstrating a good faith effort to comply, based on quarterly progress reports and milestones. The exemption may be terminated early if the state fails to report or demonstrate continued compliance.

**Sec. 10103. Availability of Standard Utility Allowances Based on Receipt of Energy Assistance.**  
Standard utility allowances are now available to SNAP households with an elderly or disabled member who receive energy assistance. Third-party energy assistance payments are restricted to households without an elderly or disabled member, ensuring targeted support. The change ensures that utility cost deductions are aligned with actual household needs and eligibility for energy aid. This adjustment applies to both standard utility allowance calculations and third-party payment rules.

**Sec. 10104. Restrictions on Internet Expenses.**  
Internet service fees are explicitly excluded from the calculation of excess shelter expenses under SNAP, preventing such costs from increasing a household’s SNAP allotment. This restriction applies to all SNAP recipients and ensures that internet costs do not inflate shelter deductions. The change limits the use of utility expenses to only those directly related to housing, not digital connectivity. It applies immediately upon enactment.

**Sec. 10105. Matching Funds Requirements.**  
Beginning in fiscal year 2028, the Federal share of SNAP funding is tied to a state’s payment error rate: 100% if below 6%, 95% if 6–8%, 90% if 8–10%, and 85% if 10% or higher. States may elect to use their 2025 or 2026 error rate for FY 2028 calculations. For states with a payment error rate × 1.5 ≥ 20%, implementation is delayed to FY 2029 (2025) or FY 2030 (2026). The Secretary may not pay more than the applicable Federal share under this tiered system.

**Sec. 10106. Administrative Cost Sharing.**  
The Federal share of administrative costs for SNAP is reduced from 50% through fiscal year 2026 to 25% for fiscal year 2027 and all subsequent years. This change applies to all states and reduces federal funding for state-level SNAP administration. The reduction is effective immediately upon enactment and applies to all administrative expenses covered under Section 16(a). States must now cover a larger share of their own administrative costs.

**Sec. 10107. National Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program.**  
The National Education and Obesity Prevention Grant Program is funded through fiscal year 2025, ending the authorization for fiscal years 2016 through 2025. The program is not extended beyond 2025, and no new funding is authorized after that date. The change terminates the program’s funding stream after the 2025 fiscal year. No further grants will be issued after 2025.

**Sec. 10108. Alien SNAP Eligibility.**  
Only individuals who are U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, Cuban/Haitian entrants, or those under a Compact of Free Association are eligible for SNAP. Non-citizens who are temporary visitors, tourists, diplomats, or students are excluded. The income and resources of ineligible aliens are still counted toward household eligibility and allotment. This change narrows eligibility to specific legal statuses and excludes most non-resident aliens.

**Sec. 10201. Rescission of Amounts for Forestry.**  
Unobligated balances from four provisions of Public Law 117-169 are rescinded: $2023, $2025, $2026, and $2027 appropriations. The rescission applies to funds from sections 23001(a), 23002(a), 23003(a)(2), and 23005. These funds are canceled and returned to the Treasury. The rescission affects forestry programs and reduces available funding for future forestry initiatives.

**Sec. 10301. Effective Reference Price; Reference Price.**  
The effective reference price for covered commodities is increased from $85 to $88 beginning with the 2025 crop year. The new reference prices for 2025 crop year are: wheat ($6.35/bushel), corn ($4.10/bushel), soybeans ($10.00/bushel), and others. Starting in 2031, reference prices will increase annually by 0.5% (multiplied by 1.005). Reference prices cannot exceed 113% of the 2025 levels.

**Sec. 10302. Base Acres.**  
The Secretary will allocate up to 30,000,000 additional base acres to eligible farms based on 2019–2023 planting history and prevented planting. Eligible farms must have a 5-year average of planted or prevented acreage exceeding their current base acres. Allocation is proportional to past planting and includes unassigned crop base. If total eligible acres exceed 30 million, a pro-rata reduction is applied.

**Sec. 10303. Producer Election.**  
Producers may elect coverage for the 2025 crop year and beyond, with the 2026 crop year now included in the election window. For 2025, the higher of Price Loss Coverage (PLC) or Agriculture Risk Coverage (ARC) payments will be made on a commodity-by-commodity basis. The election period is extended to include the 2026 crop year, and producers must re-elect for each crop year. The change ensures continuity and flexibility in coverage selection.

**Sec. 10304. Price Loss Coverage.**  
PLC payments are extended through the 2031 crop year, with the reference price and payment calculation updated accordingly. The 2025 crop year is now included in the calculation period, and the 2012–2016 reference period is replaced with 2017–2021. The payment formula is adjusted to reflect updated data and eligibility. The change ensures PLC remains available through 2031.

**Sec. 10305. Agriculture Risk Coverage.**  
ARC payments are extended through 2031, with benchmark revenue calculated for 2014–2024 at 90% of the prior benchmark and 2025–2031 at 12% of the benchmark. The 2023 reference period is replaced with 2031. The payment rate for 2014–2024 is 10%, and for 2025–2031 it is 12%. The change ensures ARC remains available through 2031.

**Sec. 10306. Equitable Treatment of Certain Entities.**  
Qualified pass-through entities (partnerships, S corporations, LLCs, joint ventures) are now explicitly recognized as eligible for farm program payments. The term “joint venture or general partnership” is replaced with “qualified pass-through entity” throughout the law. Attribution of payments, liability, and AGI calculations now apply to these entities. The change ensures equitable treatment of non-corporate farming entities.

**Sec. 10307. Payment Limitations.**  
The payment limit for producers is increased from $125,000 to $155,000 per crop year, with annual inflation adjustments based on the CPI. The adjustment applies to both individual and corporate payments. The change ensures payments remain aligned with inflation. The limit is effective for the 2025 crop year and beyond.

**Sec. 10308. Adjusted Gross Income Limitation.**  
The AGI limit now excludes certain payments (e.g., from subtitle E of the Agricultural Act of 2014, section 196 of the 1996 Act, and post-October 1, 2024, payments). If ≥75% of a person’s income comes from farming, ranching, or silviculture, the AGI limit does not apply. The change expands eligibility for high-income farmers engaged in agricultural activities. The exception applies to crop, fiscal, or program years.

**Sec. 10309. Marketing Loans.**  
Nonrecourse marketing loans are extended through the 2031 crop year. Loan rates for 2026–2031 are set at $3.72/bushel (wheat), $2.42/bushel (corn), $6.82/bushel (soybeans), and others. Cotton storage payments are available for 2026–2031 at $4.90/ton (California/Arizona) and $3.00/ton (other states). The change ensures continued access to loan and storage support.

**Sec. 10310. Repayment of Marketing Loans.**  
Repayment rates for rice and cotton are based on the prevailing world market price. For upland cotton, a refund is issued if the repayment rate exceeds the lowest 30-day world price. The formula for extra long staple cotton includes quality and location adjustments. The change ensures fair repayment and prevents losses to producers.

**Sec. 10311. Economic Adjustment Assistance for Textile Mills.**  
The assistance rate for textile mills is increased from 3 cents to 5 cents per pound, effective August 1, 2025. The rate applies to the period beginning August 1, 2013, and ending July 31, 2025, at 3 cents, and from August 1, 2025, onward at 5 cents. The change supports the domestic textile industry. The increase is effective immediately.

**Sec. 10312. Sugar Program Updates.**  
The loan rate for raw cane sugar is set at 24.00 cents per pound for 2025–2031. The rate for refined sugar is 136.55% of the raw cane loan rate. Storage rates are set at 34 cents/hundredweight/month (refined) and 27 cents/hundredweight/month (raw). The change modernizes sugar program terms. The update applies to 2025–2031.

**Sec. 10313. Dairy Policy Updates.**  
Dairy margin coverage production history is based on the highest of 2021–2023 milk marketings. New dairy operations may use extrapolated or herd-size-based estimates. The payment cap is increased from 5 million to 6 million pounds. Premiums and discounts are adjusted to reflect the new cap. The change supports dairy producers.

**Sec. 10314. Implementation.**  
$50 million is allocated to implement subtitle C, with $5 million for surveys, $3 million for activities, $9 million for dairy surveys, and $1 million for a sugar study. The funds are available until expended. The change ensures implementation capacity. The funds are distributed to specific activities.

Predation losses are reimbursed at 100% of market value; weather/disease losses at 75%. Unborn livestock losses are eligible for payments up to 85% of the lowest weight class rate. Payment amounts are based on species and gestation. The change expands disaster support.

**Sec. 10501. Beginning Farmer and Rancher Benefit.**  
Beginning farmers receive 5 percentage points of premium assistance for the first two reinsurance years, 3 for the third, and 1 for the fourth. The definition of “beginning farmer” is extended from 5 to 10 years. The change supports new producers. The benefit is in addition to existing assistance.

**Sec. 10502. Area-Based Crop Insurance Coverage and Affordability.**  
Area-based coverage can be purchased at up to 95% of yield or revenue. Premium subsidies are increased from 65% to 80%. The change improves affordability and access. The benefit applies to all eligible contracts.

**Sec. 10503. Administrative and Operating Expense Adjustments.**  
The Risk Management Agency will pay 6% of net book premium for loss adjustment expenses. Specialty crop contracts receive a minimum 17% reimbursement. Inflation adjustments are applied starting in 2026. The change improves insurer support.

**Sec. 10504. Premium Support.**  
Premium support rates are increased: 69% (C), 64% (D), 60% (E), 51% (F), and 41% (G). The change improves affordability. The increase applies to all eligible policies. The support is effective immediately.
