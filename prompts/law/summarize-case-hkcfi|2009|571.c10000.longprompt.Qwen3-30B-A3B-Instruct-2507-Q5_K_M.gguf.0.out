### 1. **Brief Summary of the Facts**

The appellant, Chan Ming Lok, was convicted by a magistrate of possessing an offensive weapon in a public place contrary to **section 33(1) of the Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245)**. The incident occurred on **29 June 2008 at approximately 1:45 a.m.** in a public area outside Nos. 9–11 Cochrane Street, Central, Hong Kong. Police officers observed the appellant walking suspiciously through several streets—Aberdeen Street, Wellington Street, and Gutzlaff Street—making repeated stops, looking around, and appearing to be monitoring his surroundings. He was carrying a rucksack, which he repositioned during his walk, resting his hand along the lower part of the bag.

When intercepted by police, the appellant was asked about the knife found in his rucksack. He claimed he carried it for self-defence because he lived in Shenzhen and returned late at night, fearing robbery due to poor public order there. He stated he used the knife as a cook and had brought it through customs many times without issue. He admitted to carrying it for protection, not for any aggressive purpose, and insisted it was not intended to injure anyone in Hong Kong.

The magistrate found that the knife was an offensive weapon under **section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance**, that the appellant had no lawful authority or reasonable excuse for possession, and convicted him of the offence. He was sentenced to **six months’ imprisonment**, which the appellant appealed on both conviction and sentence.

### 2. **Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties**

#### **Appellant’s Argument (Mr. Stephen Wong):**
- The magistrate failed to clearly identify **which category** of offensive weapon the knife fell into under **section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance**, which lists four categories: (a) made for causing injury; (b) adapted for use as a weapon; (c) suitable for causing injury; (d) intended for such use.
- The magistrate explicitly ruled out categories (a) and (b), but did not state whether she relied on (c) or (d). However, her reference to the knife being “pointed and quite sharp and could cause injury” suggests she may have based her finding on **category (c)**—that the knife was “suitable for causing injury.”
- Mr. Wong argued that **category (c)** may no longer be valid due to **constitutional concerns under the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (Cap. 383)**. He cited **R v. Chong Ah Choi & Others [1994] 2 HKCLR 263**, where Bokhary JA (then) suggested obiter that **section 2(c)** might be incompatible with the right to personal security and privacy under **Article 17 of the Bill of Rights Ordinance**, and thus should be interpreted as if repealed.
- Therefore, if category (c) is invalid, and the magistrate relied on it, the conviction would be flawed. Even if the knife was intended for self-defence, the appellant argued that **intent to use it in self-defence in mainland China**—not in Hong Kong—should negate the requirement for a finding of intent to cause injury in Hong Kong, and thus undermine the conviction.

#### **Respondent’s Argument (Miss Vinci Lam, representing the HKSAR):**
- While acknowledging the magistrate’s findings were not perfectly articulated, the court should infer that she applied the **correct legal framework**, especially given that the **Secretary of Justice has accepted** that **only three categories remain** (a), (b), and (d), and that **category (c) is no longer enforceable** due to constitutional concerns.
- The magistrate’s reference to the knife being “pointed and sharp” was not meant to establish suitability under (c), but rather to support the conclusion that the **appellant intended the knife for use as a weapon**—i.e., falling under **category (d)**: “intended by the person having it… for such use.”
- The appellant’s own admission that he carried the knife for self-defence in Shenzhen, and that he used it to protect himself from potential robbery, constituted **an admission of intent to use it to cause injury**—even if only in self-defence. This satisfies the **intention element** under category (d).
- The fact that the intended use was in mainland China is irrelevant: the law applies to possession in Hong Kong, regardless of where the intended use might occur.
- Regarding sentence, the respondent acknowledged the appellant’s lack of prior convictions and the relatively small size of the knife, but maintained that the seriousness of carrying any offensive weapon in public justifies a custodial sentence.

### 3. **Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) – Detailed and Thorough Analysis**

The **ratio decidendi** of *HKSAR v. Chan Ming Lok* is multifaceted and touches on **constitutional interpretation**, **statutory construction**, **evidentiary inference**, and **the scope of self-defence as a reasonable excuse** under the Public Order Ordinance. The judgment is notable not only for its clarity on the law but also for its **implicit recognition of a constitutional tension** in Hong Kong’s criminal law framework.

#### **A. The Constitutional Interpretation of “Suitable for Causing Injury” (Section 2(c))**

The most significant legal principle established in this case is the **de facto invalidation of section 2(c)** of the Public Order Ordinance—**“an article suitable for causing injury to the person”**—due to its **incompatibility with the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (HKBORO)**.

Although the Court of Appeal in *R v. Chong Ah Choi & Others* [1994] 2 HKCLR 263 had only **obiter dicta** suggesting that section 2(c) might be unconstitutional under **Article 17 of the HKBORO** (right to personal security), the **HKSAR’s acceptance in this case** that only three categories remain (a), (b), and (d) effectively **confirms the obiter view as the current legal reality**.

This is a **novel and controversial development** because:
- It represents a **judicially driven reinterpretation of primary legislation** without formal amendment.
- It reflects a **heightened sensitivity to human rights** in Hong Kong’s legal system, even in the absence of a formal constitutional court or entrenched bill of rights.
- It creates a **legal vacuum**: the statute remains on the books, but courts now **refuse to apply one of its key provisions** based on constitutional concerns.

The court in *Chan Ming Lok* explicitly notes the **"surprise"** that, over 14 years after *Chong Ah Choi*, the legislature has not amended the ordinance. This highlights a **systemic failure in legislative responsiveness** to judicial constitutional interpretation—a recurring issue in Hong Kong’s legal landscape.

#### **B. The Role of Intent in Defining an Offensive Weapon (Category d)**

The judgment affirms that **intent to use an object as a weapon**—even for self-defence—is sufficient to constitute possession of an offensive weapon under **section 2(d)**.

The magistrate had not explicitly stated that the appellant intended the knife for use as a weapon. However, the **Court of First Instance (CFI)** held that the **appellant’s own admission**—that he carried the knife “for self-defence” and “to protect himself from robbery”—constituted **a clear admission of intent to use it to cause injury**, even if only in self-defence.

This is a **crucial legal principle**:
- The law does **not require proof of intent to harm** or to commit a crime.
- It only requires **intent to use the object as a weapon**—i.e., to cause injury.
- Even **defensive intent** qualifies as “intended for such use” under section 2(d), because the **possibility of injury is inherent in the use of a weapon**, regardless of motive.

This interpretation is **controversial** because:
- It **criminalizes self-defence** in a way that may seem disproportionate.
- It **blurs the line between lawful self-defence and unlawful possession**.
- It raises concerns about **over-criminalization** of ordinary people carrying knives for protection, especially in high-risk environments.

Yet, the court emphasizes that **self-defence is not a “reasonable excuse”** under the Public Order Ordinance **unless there is imminent danger**. The absence of any evidence of immediate threat—such as being followed, attacked, or in a dangerous area—means the defence fails.

#### **C. The Inference of Legal Findings from Ambiguous Statements**

The court grapples with the **magistrate’s unclear reasoning** in paragraph 20 of her Statement of Findings. She:
- Explicitly ruled out (a) and (b);
- Did not mention (d);
- Referred to the knife being “pointed and sharp and could cause injury”;
- Then concluded it was an offensive weapon.

The CFI held that **despite the ambiguity**, the **context and the appellant’s admissions** allow for a **reconstruction of the magistrate’s reasoning**. The court concluded that the magistrate must have relied on **category (d)**—intent—because:
- She did not find the knife “suitable” under (c), which is now invalid.
- She did not find it “adapted” under (b).
- The only remaining basis is **intent**, which the appellant admitted.

This reflects a **principle of judicial deference to trial judges’ findings**, especially when:
- The magistrate is experienced;
- The evidence is clear;
- The outcome is not manifestly wrong.

The court applies the **“no reasonable doubt” standard** and asks whether, **even if the reasoning was flawed**, the **conviction still stands** based on the **overall evidence**.

This is a **significant procedural principle**: courts may **uphold convictions based on reconstructed reasoning** when the **evidentiary foundation is solid**, even if the trial judge’s articulation was poor.

#### **D. The Rejection of Self-Defence as a Reasonable Excuse (Even for Non-Local Use)**

The court **explicitly rejects** the argument that the **location of intended use** (mainland China) affects the legality of possession in Hong Kong.

The appellant argued that since he intended to use the knife only in Shenzhen, and not in Hong Kong, it should not be considered an offensive weapon under Hong Kong law.

The court **rejects this** on the grounds that:
- The **law applies to possession in Hong Kong**, regardless of where the intended use occurs.
- The **risk of injury in Hong Kong** is what matters.
- The **possibility of using the knife in Hong Kong**—even if not intended—still satisfies the legal threshold.

This is a **novel and important principle**: **the law does not distinguish between domestic and foreign intent** in the context of weapon possession. The **territoriality of the offence is based on location of possession**, not location of intended use.

This has **practical implications** for cross-border commuters, especially those from mainland China who may carry knives for self-defence in their home region but are subject to Hong Kong’s stricter laws.

### 4. **Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case**

Several aspects of this case stand out as **striking, unusual, or remarkable**, both legally and socially:

#### **A. The De Facto Overruling of a Statute Without Legislative Action**
The most remarkable feature is that **a key provision of a primary statute (section 2(c)) has been effectively nullified by judicial interpretation**, despite the legislature’s failure to act for over 14 years. This is **unusual in common law systems**, where courts typically do not strike down legislation unless it is clearly unconstitutional. Here, the court **accepts the constitutional invalidity of a provision** based on **obiter dicta** from a prior case, and **the government itself concedes the point**.

This reflects a **unique feature of Hong Kong’s legal system**: the **strong influence of the Bill of Rights Ordinance** and the **high degree of judicial independence** in interpreting human rights protections—even in criminal law.

#### **B. The Appellant’s Admission of Self-Defence as a Basis for Conviction**
It is **remarkable** that the **appellant’s own admission of self-defence**—a seemingly reasonable and sympathetic motive—was **used against him** to prove **intent to cause injury**. This underscores the **rigidity of the law**: even a **non-aggressive, defensive purpose** can trigger criminal liability if the object is capable of causing harm.

This raises **ethical and policy questions**: Should a person be punished for carrying a knife to protect themselves from crime in a dangerous environment? The court says yes—**if there is no imminent danger**.

#### **C. The Sentence Reduction Despite Conviction**
The court **upheld the conviction** but **reduced the sentence from 6 to 4 months**—a **significant leniency** given the seriousness of the offence. This reflects a **balancing of justice and proportionality**:
- The knife was small and domestic.
- The appellant had no prior record.
- He was not engaged in suspicious activity beyond walking.
- He was a chef, working late, returning from Shenzhen.

This **leniency in sentencing** contrasts with the **strictness in conviction**, highlighting a **dual approach**: the law is strict in defining what constitutes an offence, but **courts may show mercy in sentencing** when the circumstances are mitigating.

#### **D. The Appellant’s Routine Commuting Pattern**
The fact that the appellant **regularly crossed the border from Shenzhen to Hong Kong**, carrying the knife through customs **many times**, yet **never faced consequences before**, is striking. It suggests a **gap in enforcement** or **lack of awareness** among both the public and authorities about the **strictness of Hong Kong’s laws on offensive weapons**.

This raises concerns about **legal certainty** and **fair notice**—if someone has done something repeatedly without penalty, should they be prosecuted for the first time?

---

### **Conclusion**

*HKSAR v. Chan Ming Lok* is a **landmark case** in Hong Kong criminal law, illustrating the **tension between public safety and individual rights**, the **power of constitutional interpretation**, and the **practical challenges of enforcing strict laws in a complex, cross-border society**. It confirms that **self-defence is not a defence** to possession of an offensive weapon unless there is **imminent danger**, and that **intent to use a knife as a weapon—even for protection—is sufficient** to trigger criminal liability. The case also reveals a **deeply embedded judicial commitment to human rights**, even in the absence of legislative reform—a rare and remarkable feature of Hong Kong’s legal culture. [end of text]
