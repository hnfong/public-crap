Okay, I need to tackle this case summary. Let me start by understanding the case details. The case is Kwok Cheuk Kin and Another v. Director of Lands and Others [2021] HKCA 54. The main issue is about the constitutionality of the New Territories Small House Policy (Small House Policy) under the Basic Law, specifically Article 40. The applicants are challenging the policy for being discriminatory based on sex and social origin, while the respondents and the interested party argue that the Ding Rights (the specific rights under the policy) are lawful traditional rights of the New Territories indigenous inhabitants (NTIIs) as per BL40.

First, the facts: The Small House Policy was introduced in 1972 and has been modified over the years. It allows NTIIs to build small houses on their land under certain conditions. The current policy includes three types of grants: free building license, private treaty grant, and land exchange. The applicants argue that these forms are discriminatory, especially against women and non-indigenous people. The respondents, however, claim that these rights are traditional and lawful, thus protected by BL40.

For the legal principles, the court had to determine if the Ding Rights fall under the "lawful traditional rights and interests" as defined in BL40. The Judge initially found that only free building licenses are traditional, but the appeal court overturned that. They considered the historical context, the drafting materials, and the coherence with other articles of the Basic Law. The key points here are the interpretation of "traditional" and "lawful" in BL40, the role of the Joint Declaration and its Annex III, and the coherence with BL120 and BL122. The court emphasized that the Ding Rights, including private treaty grants and exchanges, are protected because they are rooted in pre-1898 customs and recognized by the colonial administration, even if they are discriminatory under the Basic Law and Hong Kong Bill of Rights.

The novel or controversial aspects might be the interpretation of "traditional" as not requiring a direct trace to pre-1898 but rather to the time of the Basic Law's drafting. Also, the court's decision that the Small House Policy is constitutional despite its discriminatory nature, which might conflict with the Basic Law's anti-discrimination provisions. The use of the Joint Declaration's Annex III to support the continuation of the policy is another point. The court also addressed the standing and delay issues, which the Judge had dismissed, but the appeal court found that the applicants lacked standing due to not having a direct interest in the policy.

What's striking about the case is the detailed historical analysis required to determine the constitutionality of the policy. The court's reliance on the Joint Declaration and its Annex III to preserve the policy's validity, even if discriminatory, shows the balance between historical rights and modern constitutional principles. The fact that the court upheld the policy despite its discriminatory nature, based on the idea that it's a traditional right, is a significant point. Also, the appeal court's decision to reject the Judge's conclusion on the "traditional" and "lawful" elements, emphasizing the coherence with other Basic Law articles, is notable. The case highlights the complexity of applying constitutional principles to historical land rights, especially in the context of the Basic Law's role in preserving these rights.

### 1. **Facts of the Case**  
The case involves a challenge to the constitutionality of the New Territories Small House Policy (Small House Policy) under the Hong Kong Basic Law (BL40) and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights (BOR22). The applicants, Kwok Cheuk Kin and another, argue that the policy is inherently discriminatory against female indigenous villagers and those of non-indigenous status, violating BL25 (right to equality), BL39 (right to freedom of religion), and BOR22 (prohibition of discrimination). The respondents (Director of Lands and the interested party) assert that the policy is protected under BL40 as it constitutes "lawful traditional rights and interests" of the New Territories Indigenous Inhabitants (NTIIs), a status defined by the colonial administration in 1898. The policy allows NTIIs to apply for small house grants under three forms: (1) free building license on private land, (2) private treaty grant on government land at a concessionary rate, and (3) land exchange (surrender and re-grant). The applicants contend that the policy’s requirements—such as male-only eligibility, land ownership restrictions, and exclusion of non-residents—contravene modern anti-discrimination laws. The Judge in the lower court initially ruled the policy unconstitutional, declaring that only free building licenses qualify as "lawful traditional rights" under BL40, while private treaty grants and exchanges do not. The respondents and the interested party appealed, arguing that the policy should be upheld as a constitutional protection for NTIIs’ historical rights, even if discriminatory.

### 2. **Arguments of the Two Parties**  
**Applicants (KWOK CHEUK KIN AND ANOTHER):**  
The applicants argue that the Small House Policy is discriminatory in three key respects:  
- **Sex Discrimination:** The policy grants rights only to male NTIIs, excluding women, which violates BL25, BL39, and BOR22. They contend that the "Ding Rights" (the right to build a small house) are not "traditional" rights under BL40 because they are not traceable to pre-1898 customs and are instead a modern administrative policy.  
- **Social Origin Discrimination:** The policy requires applicants to be descendants of residents of recognized villages in 1898, which excludes non-indigenous individuals and creates a birth-based hierarchy.  
- **Failure to Comply with BL7:** The policy fails to fulfill the Government’s duty to manage land for the benefit of all Hong Kong residents, as it prioritizes NTIIs over others.  

They also challenge the Judge’s conclusion that the policy is constitutional only for free building licenses, arguing that the "lawful" element of BL40 should not be interpreted as requiring the rights to be lawful under Qing law (pre-1898) or Hong Kong law (post-1997), but rather under the Basic Law itself. The applicants claim that the policy’s discriminatory nature would not be justified under the proportionality test, as it does not serve a legitimate public interest or provide a reasonable alternative for women or non-indigenous applicants.  

**Respondents and Interested Party:**  
The respondents and the interested party argue that the Small House Policy is a lawful traditional right under BL40, as it reflects the historical customs of NTIIs to build houses on their land since the New Territories Lease in 1898. They emphasize that the policy was not only recognized by the colonial administration but also codified in legislation (e.g., the Buildings Ordinance and the Joint Declaration’s Annex III) and that its discriminatory aspects are not a violation of BL40 because the policy is rooted in pre-1898 traditions and is protected by the Basic Law’s constitutional framework.  

They assert that the "lawful" and "traditional" elements of BL40 are not mutually exclusive but must be interpreted in the context of the Basic Law’s purpose to preserve NTIIs’ rights. The respondents argue that the policy’s discriminatory nature is not a flaw under BL40, as the Basic Law’s anti-discrimination provisions (BL25, BOR22) are not meant to invalidate rights that are "lawful traditional" under the Basic Law’s historical context. They also contend that the policy’s continuation is mandated by the Joint Declaration’s Annex III, which preserves land rights granted before 1 July 1997, including the Small House Policy.  

The respondents further argue that the applicants lack standing to challenge the policy because they do not intend to build a house under it and have no direct interest in the land affected by the policy. They also claim that the applicants’ delay in filing the judicial review application is a significant factor in dismissing the case, as the policy has been in place since 1972 and has been consistently applied without legal challenge.

### 3. **Legal Principles (Ratio Decedendi)**  
The court’s decision hinges on a nuanced interpretation of the Basic Law’s Article 40, which protects the "lawful traditional rights and interests of the indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories." The key legal principles are as follows:  

#### **A. Interpretation of "Lawful Traditional Rights and Interests" in BL40**  
The court held that the "lawful" and "traditional" elements of BL40 must be interpreted in the context of the Basic Law’s drafting in 1990, not strictly by reference to pre-1898 Qing law or post-1997 Hong Kong law. The "lawful" requirement is satisfied if the rights are recognized in the Hong Kong legal system at the time of the Basic Law’s enactment, even if they are discriminatory under modern laws like the Hong Kong Bill of Rights (BOR22). The "traditional" element is not confined to rights traceable to pre-1898 customs but includes rights that have been historically practiced by NTIIs and are embedded in the legal system (e.g., through colonial legislation, land titles, or the Joint Declaration). The court emphasized that the Basic Law’s purpose is to preserve NTIIs’ rights as they existed in 1898, even if they are not fully aligned with contemporary equality principles.  

This interpretation is controversial because it allows for the continuation of discriminatory practices under the guise of "traditional rights," potentially conflicting with the Basic Law’s anti-discrimination provisions. The court rejected the applicants’ argument that "lawful" must be interpreted under Qing law, noting that the drafters of the Basic Law were not concerned with the legality of NTIIs’ rights under Qing law but rather with their recognition in the Hong Kong legal system at the time of the Basic Law’s drafting.  

#### **B. Coherence with Other Basic Law Articles**  
The court stressed the importance of coherence between BL40 and other provisions of the Basic Law, particularly BL120 and BL122, which are derived from Annex III of the Joint Declaration. BL120 explicitly states that land leases and rights related to them (including small house grants) granted before 1 July 1997 must continue to be recognized and protected. BL122 further confirms that small house grants to NTIIs (as defined by the Small House Policy) are protected, even if they are discriminatory against women. The court concluded that BL40 must be read in harmony with these provisions, ensuring that the Small House Policy is treated as a constitutional right, not a subject to modern legal scrutiny.  

This coherence argument is novel because it ties the interpretation of BL40 to the broader framework of the Basic Law, including its relationship with the Joint Declaration. The court rejected the lower court’s reliance on a "tracing" exercise to determine whether rights are traceable to pre-1898 customs, instead emphasizing that the policy’s historical roots and legislative recognition are sufficient to qualify it as a "traditional" right.  

#### **C. Role of the Joint Declaration and Annex III**  
The court held that Annex III of the Joint Declaration, which preserves land rights granted before 1 July 1997, provides a direct basis for the constitutionality of the Small House Policy. The policy’s continuation is mandated by the agreement between the UK and PRC Governments to protect NTIIs’ land rights, including the right to build small houses. The court noted that the Joint Declaration’s Annex III does not explicitly mention the protection of male-only rights, but the rent benefits and land grant provisions in Annex III implicitly support the policy’s validity.  

This interpretation is controversial because it relies on the Joint Declaration’s provisions to justify the policy’s discriminatory nature, which may conflict with the Basic Law’s anti-discrimination principles. The court also rejected the applicants’ argument that the policy’s discriminatory aspects would have been challenged under the BOR before 1997, citing the CEDAW reservations by both the UK and PRC Governments, which exempt the policy from scrutiny under international human rights law.  

#### **D. Standing and Delay in Proceedings**  
The court rejected the applicants’ standing argument, noting that they have no direct interest in the policy’s application. The applicants do not intend to build a house under the policy and have no claim to land affected by it. The court also dismissed the applicants’ claim that the policy’s delay in being challenged is a valid ground for dismissal, emphasizing that the policy has been in place since 1972 and has been consistently applied without legal challenge. The court found that the applicants’ delay is not a valid reason to deny relief, as the policy’s discriminatory nature is not a matter of public interest that requires immediate judicial intervention.  

This decision is remarkable because it prioritizes the continuity of the policy over the applicants’ procedural arguments, highlighting the tension between constitutional rights and administrative efficiency. The court’s reliance on the "coherence principle" to interpret BL40 in conjunction with BL120 and BL122 underscores the importance of maintaining the policy’s validity for the benefit of NTIIs, even if it is discriminatory under modern standards.  

#### **E. Historical Continuity and Customary Practices**  
The court emphasized that the Small House Policy is rooted in the colonial administration’s recognition of NTIIs’ customs to build houses on their land since 1898. The policy’s forms (free building license, private treaty grant, land exchange) are all derived from pre-1898 practices, such as the "customary tenure" system, which allowed NTIIs to build on their land without external approval. The court rejected the applicants’ claim that these forms are not "traditional" because they are not directly traceable to pre-1898 customs, arguing instead that they preserve the core features of those rights.  

This historical analysis is novel in its scope, as the court explicitly traces the policy’s origins to colonial-era land administration practices, including the "customary tenure" system. The court also noted that the policy’s discriminatory nature is not a flaw under BL40 because the Basic Law’s anti-discrimination provisions (BL25, BOR22) are not meant to invalidate rights that are "lawful traditional" under the Basic Law’s historical context.  

#### **F. The "Ding Rights" and Their Scope**  
The court clarified that the "Ding Rights" (the right to build a small house) are not limited to free building licenses but include private treaty grants and land exchanges. The applicants’ argument that these forms are not "lawful traditional" was rejected, as the policy’s forms are all part of the colonial administration’s recognition of NTIIs’ rights. The court held that the Small House Policy is constitutional in its entirety, as it reflects the historical rights of NTIIs and is protected by the Basic Law’s framework.  

This conclusion is controversial because it upholds the policy’s discriminatory nature under the guise of "traditional rights," which may conflict with the Basic Law’s commitment to equality. The court’s reliance on the "coherence principle" and the Joint Declaration’s Annex III to justify this outcome is a key point of contention, as it prioritizes historical continuity over modern legal standards.

### 4. **Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case**  
The case is remarkable for its **extensive historical analysis** and the **complex interplay between colonial-era customs, post-1997 legal frameworks, and international human rights law**. The court’s interpretation of BL40 as a constitutional protector of NTIIs’ historical rights, even if discriminatory under modern standards, is unprecedented in Hong Kong law. This decision reflects the Basic Law’s unique role in preserving colonial-era rights while also incorporating post-1997 legal principles, creating a tension between historical continuity and contemporary equality.  

Another striking aspect is the **coherence principle** applied to BL40, BL120, and BL122. The court explicitly stated that these provisions must be read together to ensure a consistent constitutional framework, which is a departure from the usual approach of interpreting each article in isolation. This highlights the Basic Law’s role in harmonizing historical and modern legal norms, even if they conflict.  

The case also raises **controversial questions about the scope of "traditional rights"**. The court’s rejection of the tracing exercise required by the lower court (which demanded a direct link to pre-1898 customs) is significant because it expands the definition of "traditional" to include rights that have evolved over time but retain their core features. This interpretation may set a precedent for how historical rights are defined in the Basic Law, potentially allowing for the protection of rights that are not strictly traceable to pre-colonial practices.  

Finally, the **legal challenge to the policy’s discriminatory nature** is notable because it is the first time the Basic Law has been tested against the Hong Kong Bill of Rights’ anti-discrimination provisions. The court’s decision to uphold the policy despite its discriminatory aspects underscores the Basic Law’s prioritization of historical rights over modern equality principles, which may be seen as a departure from the Basic Law’s stated goal of ensuring "equality of all persons" under Article 25. This creates a paradox: the Basic Law is designed to protect the rights of all Hong Kong residents, yet it may be used to justify the continuation of a policy that discriminates against women and non-indigenous individuals.  

In summary, the case is extraordinary for its **historical depth**, **coherence-based interpretation of the Basic Law**, and the **controversial balance between historical rights and modern anti-discrimination principles**. It highlights the unique challenges of applying constitutional law to historical land rights in a post-colonial context, as well as the role of the Joint Declaration in preserving these rights.
