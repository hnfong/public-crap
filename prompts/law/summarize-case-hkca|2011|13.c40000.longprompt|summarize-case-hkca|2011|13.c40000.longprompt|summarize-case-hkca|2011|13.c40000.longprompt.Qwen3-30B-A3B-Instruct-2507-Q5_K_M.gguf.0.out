### 1. **Brief Summary of the Facts**

The case, *Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v. Chan Chun Chuen and Another* [2011] HKCA 13, is a high-profile probate dispute concerning the validity of two wills made by the late Nina Wang, a billionaire businesswoman and philanthropist, and chairwoman of the Chinachem Group—one of Hong Kong’s most powerful private conglomerates. The estate was estimated to be worth around HK$100 billion.

- **The 2002 Will**: Executed on 28 July 2002, this will left the entirety of Nina Wang’s estate to the **Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd**, a foundation she co-founded with her late husband, Teddy Wang. The will included unique provisions, such as entrusting the foundation’s supervision to a tripartite body comprising the UN Secretary-General, the Premier of China, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong. It also expressed her wish to support Teddy Wang’s family, staff of the group, and to establish a world-renowned Chinese prize akin to the Nobel Prize.

- **The 2006 Will**: Allegedly executed on 16 October 2006, this document was produced by the **first defendant, Chan Chun Chuen**, a self-styled *fung shui* master who had a long-term, secret romantic relationship with Nina Wang. The 2006 will purportedly bequeathed her entire estate to Chan. It was signed by Nina Wang and witnessed by solicitor Winfield Wong and Mr Ng Shung Mo, a senior employee of Chinachem.

- **Key Background**: Nina Wang had been diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2004 and died on 3 April 2007. Immediately after her death, Chan produced the 2006 will, which he claimed had been signed and kept secret by him. He asserted that Nina Wang had deeply loved him and wanted to leave him everything, including board positions in her companies.

- **Evidence of Forgery**: The trial judge, Lam J, found the 2006 will to be a **forgery**. Key findings included:
  - The attesting witnesses (Wong and Ng) testified that they had witnessed a **different document**—a partial will giving a Mr Chan HK$10 million—on 16 October 2006, not the 2006 will.
  - The signature on the 2006 will was **written over a crease** in the paper, but the witnesses said the document they saw was folded, not creased.
  - Scientific analysis confirmed the **Nina Wang signature was a highly skilled forgery**, and the **Winfield Wong signature was also forged**.
  - The 2006 will was typed on a typewriter, not a computer, and no copy was found at Chinachem offices after her death.
  - Nina Wang’s health in late October 2006 was so poor she could barely move, making it physically impossible for her to have prepared or signed the will herself.
  - Chan had received massive financial gifts from Nina Wang over the years (including HK$688 million in three payments), but she never changed her 2002 will or indicated it was invalid.

- **Judge’s Findings**: The judge concluded that Chan had **deliberately forged the 2006 will** to claim Nina Wang’s vast fortune. He found Chan untrustworthy, inconsistent, and that he had fabricated his relationship with Nina Wang. The judge also rejected the idea that the 2002 will was a “public image enhancement” exercise, noting that Nina Wang continued her philanthropy and leadership of the foundation even after the 2002 will.

- **Appeal**: Chan appealed, arguing the judge had failed to properly assess the **inherent improbabilities** and that the handwriting evidence was flawed. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, upholding the finding of forgery and affirming the costs order.

### 2. **Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties**

#### **Plaintiff (Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd):**
- The 2002 will is valid and should be admitted to probate.
- The 2006 will is a **forgery**.
- The attesting witnesses (Wong and Ng) had witnessed a **different document**—a partial will with a bequest to Mr Chan—on 16 October 2006, not the 2006 will.
- The **signature on the 2006 will was forged**, both in terms of the handwriting and the physical condition of the paper (written over a crease).
- Nina Wang was too ill in late October 2006 to have signed the will.
- Chan had no legitimate reason to produce the 2006 will immediately after her death, and his conduct was suspicious and inconsistent.
- The 2002 will was never revoked, and Nina Wang had consistently supported the foundation, even after her cancer diagnosis.
- The **handwriting expert (Mr Radley)** correctly identified the 2006 will as a forgery based on the accumulation of rare, unusual features (rarities) in the signature.

#### **First Defendant (Chan Chun Chuen):**
- The 2006 will is genuine and should be admitted to probate.
- The 2002 will was a **charade**—a strategic document created under pressure from the earlier litigation over Teddy Wang’s will, intended to gain public sympathy and support.
- He had a **deep, loving relationship** with Nina Wang, which she acknowledged and cherished.
- The 2006 will was signed in secret and given to him by Nina Wang, who wanted to keep it confidential.
- The attesting witnesses (Wong and Ng) were mistaken or confused about the document they witnessed.
- The **handwriting evidence was flawed**:
  - Mr Radley incorrectly equated “rarities” with “differences”.
  - He excluded 42 hospital signatures, which were relevant for comparison.
  - The “no-lose” argument (that large variation in genuine signatures makes matching inevitable) invalidates Radley’s conclusions.
  - The accumulation of rare features does not prove forgery.
- The judge failed to properly consider the **inherent improbabilities**—e.g., that a forger would risk everything to forge a will.
- The judge was biased against the relationship between Nina Wang and Chan, which tainted his judgment.

### 3. **Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) – Detailed and Thorough Analysis**

The case is a landmark in **probate law**, **evidence**, and **handwriting analysis**, with several **novel and controversial legal principles** emerging from the Court of Appeal’s judgment. The ratio decidendi—the binding legal reasoning—extends beyond the mere determination of will validity and touches on **the burden of proof in forgery cases**, **the role of expert evidence**, **the treatment of inherent improbabilities**, and **the use of statistical reasoning in handwriting identification**.

#### **A. The Burden of Proof and the Standard of Proof in Will Forgery Cases**

The central legal principle established is that **in a contested will case, the burden of proving forgery lies with the party challenging the will’s authenticity**—in this case, the plaintiff. However, the Court of Appeal emphasized that **the standard of proof is not merely “on a balance of probabilities” but must be “clear and convincing”** when the allegations involve **fraud, forgery, or egregious misconduct**.

The judge’s finding that the 2006 will was a forgery was not based on a single piece of evidence but on a **convergence of multiple, independent lines of evidence**:
- The **attesting witnesses’ testimony** that they witnessed a different document.
- The **physical evidence** (signature over a crease).
- The **handwriting analysis**.
- The **inconsistencies in the defendant’s conduct and timeline**.
- The **lack of any contemporaneous record** of the will’s existence.

The Court of Appeal affirmed that **when a party produces a document that contradicts the known intentions and behavior of the testator**, and when **the document is produced under suspicious circumstances**, the court may infer forgery **even without direct proof of the forger’s identity**, provided the evidence is **overwhelming and consistent**.

This reflects a **shift toward a more flexible, fact-based approach** to forgery cases, where the court is not required to prove *how* the forgery was committed, but can infer it from the **totality of the circumstances**.

#### **B. The Role of Inherent Improbabilities and the Judge’s Discretion**

A major point of contention on appeal was whether the judge had properly considered the **“inherent improbabilities”**—a concept derived from *HKSAR v Egan* and *Nina Kung v Wang Din Shin*. These are **logical inconsistencies or unlikely scenarios** that, if present, should cast doubt on a party’s version of events.

The first defendant argued that the judge had **failed to give sufficient weight** to the improbability that a forger would risk everything to forge a will, especially given the high stakes.

The Court of Appeal **rejected this argument**, holding that:
> **The judge is not required to assign a specific weight to each inherent improbability.** Instead, the judge must **consider them as part of the overall evaluation of credibility and consistency**.

The Court emphasized that **the judge’s role is not to apply a mechanical formula**, but to **assess the totality of the evidence**, including the **credibility of witnesses**, **the plausibility of the narrative**, and **the consistency of conduct**.

Crucially, the Court held that **the judge’s conclusion that the 2006 will was a forgery was not based on a single improbability, but on a chain of them**, including:
- The document was signed on a day when Nina Wang was too ill to move.
- The signature was written over a crease, contradicting the witnesses’ testimony.
- The will was not found at Chinachem, despite a search.
- The will was produced immediately after death, with no prior mention.
- The witnesses had seen a different document.

Thus, the **ratio decidendi** is that **inherent improbabilities are not standalone grounds for rejection, but are tools to test the coherence of a narrative**. When multiple improbabilities converge, they can **undermine the credibility of a party’s case**, even if individually they are not decisive.

#### **C. The Use of Handwriting Analysis and the “Rarity” Principle**

This case is **seminal in the development of handwriting identification law**, particularly in the **application of statistical reasoning** to forensic handwriting analysis.

The plaintiff’s expert, Mr Radley, used a **novel approach** based on the **“rarity” principle**: instead of focusing on isolated similarities or differences, he argued that **the presence of a large number of rare, unusual features in a questioned signature is highly improbable if the signature is genuine**.

The Court of Appeal **endorsed this approach**, stating:
> **“An accumulation of rare features in a questioned signature is so improbable that it amounts to very strong evidence of forgery.”**

This is a **significant departure from traditional handwriting analysis**, which often focuses on **individual characteristics** and **differences**. Radley’s method treats **rarities as “differences”** in a modified sense—**not as deviations from a single sample, but as features that are statistically rare across a large corpus of genuine signatures**.

The Court accepted that:
- **Rarities are not just “differences” in the traditional sense**, but **unusual features that are unlikely to occur together by chance**.
- The **“no-lose” argument** (that large variation in genuine signatures makes matching inevitable) is **invalid** when applied to **rare features**—because **rare features are not common enough to be “covered” by variation**.
- The **likelihood ratio** (a statistical tool from Huber & Headrick) supports this: the odds of a genuine signature containing 10–15 rare features are **in the trillions to one**.

This principle is **controversial** because:
- It **shifts the burden of proof** in handwriting cases.
- It **introduces statistical inference** into a field traditionally seen as subjective.
- It **challenges the traditional view** that handwriting analysis is based on “expert opinion” rather than “scientific probability”.

Yet the Court held that **this approach is not only valid but necessary** in high-stakes cases like this, where **the consequences of error are catastrophic**.

#### **D. The Credibility of Witnesses and the “Credibility Gap”**

The Court of Appeal placed **great weight on the credibility of the attesting witnesses**, particularly Mr Winfield Wong.

Despite the fact that Wong’s **initial statement (7 April 2007)** was inconsistent with later drafts, the Court held that:
> **The judge was entitled to accept Wong’s original statement as truthful**, especially given:
> - His careful, precise, and consistent testimony.
> - His willingness to correct minor errors.
> - His clear distinction between a “partial will” and a “codicil”.
> - His refusal to accept the revised drafts prepared by Mr Sujanani.

The Court rejected the argument that Wong had “tailored” his evidence, noting that **he had no motive to lie** and that **his testimony was consistent with the physical evidence** (e.g., the crease).

This reinforces the principle that **a witness’s credibility is assessed not by minor inconsistencies, but by the overall coherence and plausibility of their account**.

#### **E. The Legal Consequences of Forgery: Costs on an Indemnity Basis**

The Court of Appeal affirmed the judge’s order that the **plaintiff recover its costs on an indemnity basis**, which is **more favorable than the standard standard basis**.

The Court held that:
> **When a party knowingly presents a forged document in court, it constitutes an egregious abuse of process**, and **costs on an indemnity basis are mandatory**.

This is a **strong deterrent** against fraud in probate litigation. The Court emphasized that **the first defendant’s conduct was not merely negligent but deliberate and dishonest**, and that **no other outcome would be just**.

### 4. **Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case**

Several aspects of this case are **extraordinary**, both legally and personally:

- **The Scale of the Estate**: The estate was estimated at **HK$100 billion**—one of the largest private fortunes in Asia. The stakes were astronomical, making this not just a legal case, but a **global financial event**.

- **The Nature of the Relationship**: The secret, long-term romantic relationship between a billionaire heiress and a *fung shui* master is **almost cinematic**. The fact that she paid him **HK$688 million in three installments**—and continued to do so even after her cancer diagnosis—adds a layer of **psychological intrigue**.

- **The “Hole-Digging” Rituals**: The court detailed **rituals of digging holes in Ap Lei Chau and other sites**—supposedly to locate her missing husband, Teddy Wang. These were not just symbolic; they were **documented, expensive, and repeated**. The judge found them to be **genuine *fung shui* practices**, not just theatrical gestures.

- **The Timing of the 2006 Will**: The will was produced **within days of her death**, with **no prior mention**, and **no copy found**. This **lack of documentation** is highly suspicious, especially given the size of the estate.

- **The Scientific Evidence**: The **handwriting analysis** was **extremely detailed**, with **statistical calculations** showing odds of forgery in the **trillions to one**. This is **unprecedented in Hong Kong probate law** and sets a new precedent for forensic evidence.

- **The Judge’s Personal Judgment**: The judge repeatedly described the first defendant as **“untrustworthy” and “a liar”**, and even referred to him as **“a man having a family in which she would not be a member”**—a **moral judgment** that is rare in judicial opinions.

- **The Aftermath**: The first defendant **applied to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal**, but the appeal was **refused**. The case remains a **cautionary tale** about the **dangers of greed and deception** in estate disputes.

In sum, this case is **not just a legal decision**, but a **dramatic story of power, love, obsession, and fraud**—played out in the highest courts of Hong Kong, with **global implications**. [end of text]
