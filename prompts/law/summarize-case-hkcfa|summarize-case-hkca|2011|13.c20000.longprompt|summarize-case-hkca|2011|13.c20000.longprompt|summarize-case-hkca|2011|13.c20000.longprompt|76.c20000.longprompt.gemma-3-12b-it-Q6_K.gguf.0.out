Okay, here's a breakdown of the *Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v. Chan Chun Chuen* case, addressing each of your tasks.

**1. Summary of Facts**

The case revolves around a dispute over the will of Nina Wang, a Hong Kong businesswoman and one of the wealthiest women in Asia. After Wang's death in 2007, two wills were presented: a 2002 will naming the Chinachem Charitable Foundation as the primary beneficiary, and a 2006 will leaving Wang's entire estate to Chan Chun Chuen, the applicant in this case. Chan Chun Chuen claimed the 2006 will was the valid one, while the Chinachem Charitable Foundation sought to have the 2002 will recognized.  A lengthy trial concluded with the court finding the 2006 will to be a forgery. Chan Chun Chuen appealed this decision, and after unsuccessful appeals to the Court of Appeal, he sought leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal (CFA). The core of the case is whether Chan Chun Chuen could appeal the finding of forgery to the CFA.

**2. Summary of Arguments**

*   **Chan Chun Chuen (Applicant):** Argued he was entitled to appeal to the CFA, either as a matter of right or at the court's discretion. He contended that his claim involved a significant property value (Wang's estate), triggering the "as of right" provision in the Court's statute. He also argued that the case raised a question of general or public importance, specifically concerning the court's practice of deferring to concurrent findings of fact by lower courts. He further argued that the Court of Appeal's review of the trial judge's findings was inadequate.
*   **Chinachem Charitable Foundation (1st Respondent):** Argued that Chan Chun Chuen was *not* entitled to appeal as of right. They asserted that his claim was not for a specific, liquidated monetary sum, but rather for a pronouncement on the validity of a will, which doesn't fall within the scope of the "as of right" provision. They also argued that the case did not involve a question of general or public importance warranting CFA intervention, and that the Court of Appeal's review was sufficient. They emphasized the importance of respecting concurrent findings of fact made by lower courts.

**3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The Court of Final Appeal's (CFA) decision in *Chinachem Charitable Foundation v. Chan Chun Chuen* significantly clarifies the scope of appeals "as of right" to the CFA and reinforces the court's reluctance to overturn concurrent findings of fact. Here's a detailed breakdown of the ratio:

*   **Narrow Construction of "As of Right" Appeals:** The CFA reiterated its established practice of narrowly construing the "as of right" provision in the Court's statute (Section 22(1)(a)). This provision allows appeals as of right in cases involving property or civil rights exceeding $1,000,000. The court emphasized that the purpose of this narrow construction is to prevent the CFA from being overburdened with appeals that lack substance and to maintain a balance between access to the highest court and a reasonably efficient resolution of litigation.
*   **Distinction Between Liquidated Claims and Unliquidated Claims:** The court firmly distinguished between claims for liquidated monetary sums (which trigger the "as of right" provision) and unliquidated claims. A probate claim, seeking a pronouncement on the validity of a will, is *not* a claim for a liquidated sum. Even if the ultimate outcome would result in a transfer of a large estate, the initial claim is not for a specific, quantifiable amount. The court rejected the argument that a probate claim should be considered an "indirect" claim to property simply because the outcome would involve the transfer of assets.
*   **The "Immediacy Requirement":** Even if a claim *could* be considered to involve property or a civil right, the CFA imposed an "immediacy requirement."  For an appeal to qualify as of right, the order sought in the appeal must have the *immediate* effect of conferring a financial benefit or detriment exceeding the $1,000,000 threshold, without requiring further adjudication. In this case, the existence of Issue 9 (the construction of the 2006 will) meant that even if the 2006 will were declared valid, further proceedings would be necessary to determine the extent of Chan Chun Chuen's entitlement, preventing the "immediacy" requirement from being met.
*   **Respect for Concurrent Findings of Fact:** The CFA reaffirmed its established practice of being reluctant to review concurrent findings of fact made by the trial court and the Court of Appeal. This practice is rooted in several policy considerations: (1) respecting the expertise of lower courts in fact-finding; (2) preventing the CFA from being bogged down in detailed factual disputes; (3) promoting a balance between access to the highest court and a reasonably efficient resolution of litigation; and (4) discouraging protracted litigation driven by a desire to re-litigate factual issues.
*   **Overcoming Concurrent Findings â€“ Miscarriage of Justice or Violation of Law:** The CFA reiterated that concurrent findings of fact will only be overturned in "rare and exceptional cases" where there is a demonstrable "miscarriage of justice" or a "violation of some principle of law or procedure." This threshold is high, and the CFA is hesitant to interfere unless there is a clear error that undermines the integrity of the judicial process.
*   **Rejection of Commonwealth Authority:** The CFA declined to adopt the construction of similar wording in probate cases from Commonwealth jurisdictions (New Zealand, Australia). The court emphasized that the rules regarding appeals as of right must be construed within the social and historical context of the CFA itself, considering its intended role, resources, and the interests of litigants and the administration of justice.
*   **The "Important Question" Ground:** While the CFA acknowledged the possibility of granting discretionary leave to appeal based on a question of general or public importance, it found that Chan Chun Chuen had not demonstrated that the case raised such a question. Specifically, his challenge to the CFA's practice regarding concurrent findings of fact was not sufficiently compelling to warrant intervention.

**4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects**

Several aspects of this case are striking:

*   **The Sheer Scale of the Estate:** The case involved a vast fortune, making it one of the most high-profile probate disputes in Hong Kong history. The sheer amount of money at stake undoubtedly contributed to the intense public interest and legal scrutiny.
*   **The Alleged Forgery:** The allegation of forgery itself is remarkable. The complexity of proving or disproving a forgery, particularly when involving sophisticated documents and potentially collusive witnesses, added a layer of intrigue to the proceedings.
*   **The CFA's Firm Stance on Concurrent Findings:** The CFA's unwavering commitment to respecting concurrent findings of fact, even in the face of arguments about inadequate review by the Court of Appeal, is notable. This demonstrates the court's determination to uphold its role as a final appellate court focused on legal principles rather than detailed factual re-examinations.
*   **The Rejection of Commonwealth Precedent:** The CFA's explicit rejection of relying on Commonwealth case law on appeals as of right, emphasizing the need to tailor its rules to its own context, is a significant statement about the autonomy of Hong Kong's judiciary.
*   **The Lengthy and Complex Litigation:** The case spanned years, involving multiple appeals and complex legal arguments. The protracted nature of the litigation highlights the challenges of resolving disputes over large estates, particularly when fraud or forgery is alleged.
