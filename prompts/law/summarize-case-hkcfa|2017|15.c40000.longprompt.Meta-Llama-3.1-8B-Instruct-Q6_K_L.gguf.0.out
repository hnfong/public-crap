**Part 1: Summary of Facts**

The case of Secretary for Justice v. Chan Chi Wan Stephen [2017] HKCFA 15 involves two appeals by Chan Chi Wan Stephen and Tseng Pei Kun, who were charged with conspiring to commit an offence under the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO) section 9. The charges arose from an incident in 2009 where Chan, a General Manager (Broadcasting) at Television Broadcasts Ltd (TVB), appeared on a live "Be My Guest" show as a guest of Olympian City, a shopping mall operated by Olympian City 2 Management Co Ltd (OC). The show was part of a New Year's Eve Countdown event produced by TVB. Chan was paid $112,000 by IEAP, a company acting as his agent, for his appearance on the show. The prosecution alleged that Chan's appearance on the show was an act done in relation to his principal's affairs or business, and that he had accepted an advantage as an inducement or reward for doing so without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.

**Part 2: Summary of Arguments**

The prosecution argued that Chan's appearance on the show was an act done in relation to his principal's affairs or business, and that he had accepted an advantage as an inducement or reward for doing so without lawful authority or reasonable excuse. The prosecution also argued that the Court of Appeal's decision was correct in holding that Chan's conduct constituted the section 9 offence. The prosecution relied on the Court of Appeal's judgment, which held that Chan's appearance on the show "related to" TVB's affairs or business, would "influence or affect" TVB, was "aimed at" TVB, and would "involve" TVB.

The appellants, on the other hand, argued that the Court of Appeal's decision was incorrect and that the trial judge's acquittal should be reinstated. They argued that Chan's appearance on the show was not an act done in relation to his principal's affairs or business, and that he had a reasonable excuse for accepting the payment. The appellants also argued that the prosecution had failed to prove that Chan's conduct was corrupt, and that the Court of Appeal's decision was based on a misconstruction of section 9.

**Part 3: Summary of Legal Principles**

The case raises several important legal principles, including the interpretation of section 9 of the POBO, the mens rea requirement for the offence, and the defence of reasonable excuse. The Court of Appeal's decision was based on a broad interpretation of the phrase "in relation to his principal's affairs or business", which was held to include any act that "related to" the principal's business, even if it did not have a direct adverse impact on the principal's interests.

However, the Privy Council's decision in Commissioner of the ICAC v Ch'ng Poh [1997] HKLRD 652 held that the phrase "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" requires that the agent's act or forbearance be "aimed at" and intended to "influence or affect" the principal's affairs. The Court of Appeal's decision was also criticized for failing to consider the mens rea requirement for the offence, which requires that the agent intend to influence or affect the principal's affairs or business.

The defence of reasonable excuse is also an important issue in this case. The Court of Appeal held that the defence of reasonable excuse is not available to the appellants, but the trial judge had found that Chan had a reasonable excuse for accepting the payment. The Court of Appeal's decision was based on a narrow interpretation of the defence of reasonable excuse, which requires that the agent have the informed consent of the principal.

The case also raises issues related to the burden of proof and the presumption of innocence. The prosecution argued that the burden of proof for the defence of reasonable excuse lies on the accused, but the appellants argued that the prosecution had failed to prove that the defence was not available. The Court of Appeal's decision was based on a strict interpretation of the burden of proof, which requires that the prosecution prove the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.

In conclusion, the case of Secretary for Justice v. Chan Chi Wan Stephen [2017] HKCFA 15 raises important issues related to the interpretation of section 9 of the POBO, the mens rea requirement for the offence, and the defence of reasonable excuse. The case highlights the importance of considering the mens rea requirement for the offence and the defence of reasonable excuse, and the need for a nuanced interpretation of the phrase "in relation to his principal's affairs or business".
