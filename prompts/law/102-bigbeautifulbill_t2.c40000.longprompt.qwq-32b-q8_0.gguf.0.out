Okay, let me tackle this query. The user wants a summary of each section in this big bill starting with Sec. 20001. They specified to be concise, use specific details, and mention parties and quantities. 

First, I need to parse the provided bill text. The sections under Title II of the Armed Services Committee start at Sec. 20001. Each section has subsections with appropriations and other changes. 

Starting with Sec. 20001: It's about enhancing DoD resources for military personnel's quality of life. The user wants a paragraph per section, so I need to list the key points here. The section has subsections (a) through (c). The main points are the appropriations for various programs like housing, health, bonuses, etc. Each item in (a) has specific amounts and purposes. I should mention the total amounts and key areas funded without getting too detailed. Also, note the temporary changes in subsections (b) and (c) regarding military housing investments and privatization.

Next, Sec. 20002 deals with shipbuilding. The appropriations here are for expanding manufacturing programs, specific ship types like Virginia-class submarines and DDG destroyers, and other naval infrastructure. The amounts are substantial, so highlighting the major allocations like the $4.6B for submarines and $5.4B for DDGs is important. Also, mention the various industrial base improvements and new technologies like AI and autonomy in shipbuilding.

For each subsequent section, I'll follow the same approach: identify the main purpose, list key appropriations with amounts, and note any regulatory or policy changes. Need to ensure each summary is within four sentences, specific, and mentions the parties involved (like the Secretary of Defense, specific military branches, or programs).

I should also check for any recurring themes, like the duration of funds (remaining available until 2029) and the use of specific funds like the Industrial Base Fund. These details are significant and should be included where relevant.

Make sure not to miss any sections. The user wants every "Sec. XXXX" covered, so I need to go through each one from 20001 to 20013 as listed. Each section's summary must be clear and to the point, avoiding vagueness. Quantities like dollar amounts and specific programs are crucial here.

Also, the user mentioned this bill was championed by Trump, so maybe the summaries should reflect the priorities highlighted by the administration, like military readiness, defense spending, and infrastructure. But the user didn't ask for analysis, just summaries, so stick to the text provided.

Finally, ensure that each section's summary starts with the section number and is in a separate paragraph. Keep sentences concise, use bullet points if needed, but the user specified paragraphs. Wait, the user said "for every Section ('Sec.'), give at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences." So each section gets its own paragraph, no bullet points. Need to structure each summary as a single paragraph with key points separated by commas or semicolons if necessary.

Double-check the amounts and ensure they're correctly noted. For example, in Sec. 20001(a)(5), the $2.9B for housing allowance. Also, note any temporary provisions or amendments to existing laws, like the changes to Title 10 sections in subsections (b) and (c).

Alright, time to start writing each section's summary following these guidelines.
