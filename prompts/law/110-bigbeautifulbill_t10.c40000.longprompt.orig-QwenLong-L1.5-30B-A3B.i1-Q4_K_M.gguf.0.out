Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a lengthy bill text and wants a summary of each section starting from Sec. 100001. They specified that for each section, I should give at most one paragraph with up to four sentences, be specific about parties, entities, and quantities, and be concise but not vague.

First, I need to parse the bill structure. The bill is titled "An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of H. Con. Res. 14." It's divided into Titles, Subtitles, Parts, and Sections. The user wants summaries for every "Sec. XXXX" starting from 100001.

Looking at the provided text, the first section is Sec. 100001. Let me check what that section says. The section is titled "APPLICABILITY OF THE IMMIGRATION LAWS." The subsections (a), (b), and (c) explain that the fees under this subtitle apply to aliens in specified circumstances, terms are defined as in the Immigration and Nationality Act, and references to the Act are maintained.

So, for Sec. 100001, I need to summarize the key points. The main points are: applicability of fees to aliens in specified circumstances, terms defined per INA, and references to INA. The user wants specific entities and quantities, but this section is more about applicability and definitions, so quantities might not be here. I should mention the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Attorney General as the entities involved, but the section itself doesn't specify fees here. Wait, the section says "the fees under this subtitle shall apply," so the subtitle is Part I on Immigration Fees. So the key is that the fees in Part I apply to aliens in the circumstances described in the subtitle. The terms are defined per INA, and references to INA are maintained.

Wait, the user said "Be specific as to parties, entities, and quantities." So for Sec. 100001, the entities are DHS and the Attorney General, but the section itself doesn't mention specific fees. So the summary should state that the fees in Part I apply to aliens in the circumstances described, terms are defined per INA, and references to INA are maintained. Need to keep it to one paragraph, max four sentences.

Moving to Sec. 100002: ASYLUM FEE. The section details the asylum fee. The fee is $100 or more in FY2025, adjusted annually for inflation. 50% goes to Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), 50% to USCIS, and any excess to the general fund. No fee waivers. So the key points: $100 initial fee (or higher), annual inflation adjustments, 50% to EOIR, 50% to USCIS, no waivers.

Sec. 100003: EMPLOYMENT AUTHORIZATION DOCUMENT FEES. There are different parts for asylum applicants, parolees, and TPS. Each has a $550 initial fee (or higher), annual inflation adjustments. For asylum applicants, 25% to USCIS (with 50% used for fraud prevention), rest to general fund. Parolees and TPS have all fees going to general fund, no waivers.

Wait, need to check each subsection. Part (a) is for asylum applicants: $550 initial, 25% to USCIS (with specific use for fraud prevention), rest to general fund. Part (b) for parolees: $550, all to general fund. Part (c) for TPS: $550, all to general fund. So the summary should mention each category's fee, the disposition of funds, and no waivers.

Sec. 100004: IMMIGRATION PAROLE FEE. $1,000 initial (or higher), annual inflation adjustments. All fees go to general fund, except for specific exceptions like medical emergencies, family reunification, etc. The exceptions are listed in subsection (b), so need to mention the exceptions briefly. The key is the fee amount, disposition, and exceptions.

Sec. 100005: SPECIAL IMMIGRANT JUVENILE FEE. $250 initial (or higher), annual inflation adjustments. All fees to general fund. The fee is required from the alien, parent, or legal guardian applying for special immigrant juvenile status.

Sec. 100006: TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS FEE. Amends Section 244(c)(1)(B) of INA. The fee is $500 (previously $50), with annual inflation adjustments. All fees to general fund, no waivers. So the key points: fee increased from $50 to $500, inflation adjustments, disposition to general fund.

Sec. 100007: VISA INTEGRITY FEE. $250 initial (or higher), annual inflation adjustments. 50% of fees go to general fund, but there's a reimbursement provision for nonimmigrant visas. Wait, subsection (a)(4) says all fees not reimbursed go to general fund. Subsection (b) allows reimbursement if the alien complies with visa conditions and departs within 5 days. So the fee is $250, reimbursement possible under certain conditions, rest to general fund.

Sec. 100008: FORM I-94 FEE. $24 initial (or higher), annual inflation adjustments. 20% to Land Border Inspection Fee Account (for CBP), rest to general fund. No waivers.

Sec. 100009: ANNUAL ASYLUM FEE. $100 initial (or higher), annual inflation adjustments. All fees to general fund, no waivers. This is an annual fee for each year the asylum application is pending.

Sec. 100010: FEE RELATING TO RENEWAL AND EXTENSION OF EMPLOYMENT AUTHORIZATION FOR PAROLEES. $275 initial (or higher), annual inflation adjustments. 25% to USCIS (with 50% for fraud prevention), rest to general fund. No waivers.

Sec. 100011: FEE RELATING TO RENEWAL OR EXTENSION OF EMPLOYMENT AUTHORIZATION FOR ASYLUM APPLICANTS. $275 minimum. Termination conditions if asylum is denied. 25% to USCIS, rest to general fund. No waivers.

Sec. 100012: FEE RELATING TO RENEWAL AND EXTENSION OF EMPLOYMENT AUTHORIZATION FOR ALIENS GRANTED TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS. $275 initial (or higher), annual inflation adjustments. 25% to USCIS, rest to general fund. No waivers.

Sec. 100013: FEES RELATING TO APPLICATIONS FOR ADJUSTMENT OF STATUS. Multiple fees: $1,500 for adjustment of status, $1,050 for waiver of grounds, $500 for TPS application, $900 for appeals, $1,325 for practitioner appeals, $900 for motions to reopen, $600 for suspension of deportation, $600 for cancellation of removal (permanent residents), $1,500 for cancellation of removal (non-permanent residents). All fees have annual inflation adjustments. 25% of each fee goes to EOIR, rest to general fund. Also, a limitation that funds can't be used for the Legal Orientation Program.

Sec. 100014: ELECTRONIC SYSTEM FOR TRAVEL AUTHORIZATION FEE. Amends Section 217(h)(3)(B) of INA. The fee is $10 minimum, $13 per travel authorization. Adjustments for inflation starting in FY2026. The fee is set to increase annually based on CPI.

Sec. 100015: ELECTRONIC VISA UPDATE SYSTEM FEE. $30 initial (or higher), annual inflation adjustments. $5 per payment goes to general fund, the rest to the CBP Electronic Visa Update System Account. No waivers.

Sec. 100016: FEE FOR ALIENS ORDERED REMOVED IN ABSENTIA. $5,000 initial (or higher), annual inflation adjustments. 50% to ICE, deposited into Detention and Removal Office Fee Account, rest to general fund. Exception if the order was rescinded.

Sec. 100017: INADMISSIBLE ALIEN APPREHENSION FEE. $5,000 initial (or higher), annual inflation adjustments. 50% to ICE, deposited into Detention and Removal Office Fee Account, rest to general fund. Wait, the section says "All of the fees collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury." Wait, no, subsection (c) says 50% to ICE, etc., and (d) says all fees to general fund. Wait, let me check. The text says: "(c) Disposition of Inadmissible Alien Apprehension Fees.--During each fiscal year-- (1) 50 percent of the fees collected pursuant to this section-- (A) shall be credited to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; (B) shall be deposited into the Detention and Removal Office Fee Account; (C) may be retained and expended by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement without further appropriation; and (2) any amounts collected pursuant to this section that are not credited to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury." Then (d) says "Disposition of Inadmissible Alien Apprehension Fees.--All of the fees collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury." Wait, that's a contradiction. Wait, looking back: "SEC. 100017. INADMISSIBLE ALIEN APPREHENSION FEE. (a) In General.--In addition to any other fee authorized by law, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall require the payment of a fee, equal to the amount specified in subsection (b), by any inadmissible alien at the time such alien is apprehended between ports of entry. (b) Amount Specified. (1) Initial amount.--For fiscal year 2025, the amount specified in this section shall be the greater of-- (A) $5,000; or (B) such amount as the Secretary of Homeland Security may establish, by rule. (2) Annual adjustments for inflation.--During fiscal year 2026, and during each subsequent fiscal year, the amount specified in this section shall be equal to the sum of-- (A) the amount of the fee required under this subsection for the most recently concluded fiscal year; and (B) the product resulting from the multiplication of the amount referred to in subparagraph (A) by the percentage (if any) by which the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for the month of July preceding the date on which such adjustment takes effect exceeds the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers for the same month of the preceding calendar year, rounded to the next lowest multiple of $10. (c) Disposition of Inadmissible Alien Apprehension Fees.--During each fiscal year-- (1) 50 percent of the fees collected pursuant to this section-- (A) shall be credited to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; (B) shall be deposited into the Detention and Removal Office Fee Account; (C) may be retained and expended by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement without further appropriation; and (2) any amounts collected pursuant to this section that are not credited to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury. (d) Disposition of Inadmissible Alien Apprehension Fees.--All of the fees collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury." Wait, subsection (d) says all fees go to general fund, but (c) says 50% to ICE and 50% to general fund. So (d) is probably a typo, but the text says (d) "All of the fees collected... shall be deposited into the general fund." So maybe (c) and (d) are conflicting, but the user's text has (d) as "Disposition of Inadmissible Alien Apprehension Fees.--All of the fees collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury." So the correct disposition is all to general fund, but (c) says 50% to ICE. Wait, maybe (d) is a duplicate or error. But according to the text, (c) specifies 50% to ICE and 50% to general fund, and (d) says all to general fund. That's a conflict. But the user provided the text, so I should go with what's written. Wait, looking at the original text: "(c) Disposition of Inadmissible Alien Apprehension Fees.--During each fiscal year-- (1) 50 percent of the fees collected pursuant to this section-- (A) shall be credited to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; (B) shall be deposited into the Detention and Removal Office Fee Account; (C) may be retained and expended by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement without further appropriation; and (2) any amounts collected pursuant to this section that are not credited to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury. (d) Disposition of Inadmissible Alien Apprehension Fees.--All of the fees collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury." So (c) says 50% to ICE and 50% to general fund, but (d) says all to general fund. That's a contradiction. But in the user's text, (d) is listed as a separate subsection. Maybe it's a typo, but I should note that in the summary. However, the user wants concise summaries, so perhaps the key point is that 50% goes to ICE (Detention and Removal Office Fee Account) and 50% to general fund, but (d) says all to general fund. Wait, but (d) is probably a mistake, so the correct disposition is as per (c). So the summary should state 50% to ICE (Detention and Removal Office Fee Account), 50% to general fund.

Sec. 100018: AMENDMENT TO AUTHORITY TO APPLY FOR ASYLUM. Amends Section 208(d)(3) of INA. Requires asylum applicants to pay fees (previously may have been optional), and removes the limit on additional adjudication and naturalization fees. So the key points: "may" becomes "shall" for fee payment, and the limitation on additional fees is removed.

Then moving to Part II: Immigration and Law Enforcement Funding. Sec. 100051: Appropriation for DHS. $2,055,000,000 for FY2025, to be used for immigration enforcement activities, removals, personnel, background checks, etc. The specific purposes are listed in (1) through (12).

Sec. 100052: Appropriation for ICE. $29,850,000,000 for FY2025. Used for hiring, bonuses, recruitment, transportation, IT, facility upgrades, family unity, 287(g) agreements, etc.

Sec. 100053: Appropriation for Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers. $750,000,000 for FY2025. $285M for training, $465M for facilities.

Sec. 100054: Appropriation for DOJ. $3,330,000,000 for FY2025. Used for EOIR staffing (800 judges by Nov 2028), drug trafficking, immigration prosecutions, etc.

Sec. 100055: BRIDGING IMMIGRATION-RELATED DEFICITS EXPERIENCED NATIONWIDE REIMBURSEMENT FUND. $3,500,000,000 for the Fund, to be used for locating/apprehending aliens, crime investigations, court operations, etc.

Sec. 100056: Appropriation for Bureau of Prisons. $5,000,000,000 for FY2025. $3B for salaries/benefits, $2B for facilities.

Sec. 100057: Appropriation for U.S. Secret Service. $1,170,000,000 for FY2025. For resources, bonuses.

Then Subtitle B: Judiciary Matters. Sec. 100101: Appropriation to Administrative Office of U.S. Courts. $1,250,000 for FY2025-2028 for court analyses.

Sec. 100102: Appropriation to Federal Judicial Center. $1,000,000 for FY2025-2028 for judicial training.

Subtitle C: Radiation Exposure Compensation. Sec. 100201: Extension of Fund. Fund terminates Dec 31, 2028 (previously 2026?).

Sec. 100202: Claims Relating to Atmospheric Testing. Adjusts leukemia and specified disease claims, increases payments to $100,000, extends time periods.

Sec. 100203: Claims Relating to Uranium Mining. Amends definitions for miners, millers, core drillers, adds renal cancer, combines work histories.

Sec. 100204: Claims Relating to Manhattan Project Waste. New section adding claims for those exposed to waste, $50k for living individuals, $25k for survivors, affected ZIP codes.

Sec. 100205: Limitations on Claims. Extends deadline to Dec 31, 2027 (from 2 years after RECA Extension Act of 2022).

Now, I need to go through each section and write a concise summary. Let's start with Sec. 100001.

Sec. 100001: Applicability of immigration laws. The fees under this subtitle apply to aliens in specified circumstances. Terms are defined per INA, and references to INA are maintained. So the summary should mention DHS and Attorney General as the entities, but the section itself is about applicability. So: "Sec. 100001 establishes that fees under this subtitle apply to aliens in specified circumstances, with terms defined per the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and references to INA maintained."

Wait, the user said "Be specific as to parties, entities, and quantities." Here, the entities are DHS and Attorney General (since they handle the fees), but the section doesn't specify quantities. So the summary should state the applicability, the terms, and references. So: "Sec. 100001 mandates that immigration fees under this subtitle apply to aliens in specified circumstances, defines terms per the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and maintains references to INA provisions."

Next, Sec. 100002: Asylum Fee. $100 initial (or higher), annual inflation adjustments. 50% to EOIR, 50% to USCIS, no waivers. So: "Sec. 100002 imposes a $100 asylum application fee (or higher in FY2025), adjusted annually for inflation, with 50% of proceeds credited to the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) and 50% to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), all without fee waivers."

Sec. 100003: Employment Authorization Document Fees. Three parts: asylum applicants ($550), parolees ($550), TPS ($550). Asylum applicants: 25% to USCIS (50% for fraud prevention), rest to general fund. Parolees and TPS: all to general fund. So: "Sec. 100003 sets $550 employment authorization fees (or higher) for asylum applicants, parolees, and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holders, with 25% of asylum applicant fees credited to USCIS (50% for fraud prevention) and all other fees deposited into the general fund, all without waivers."

Wait, the user said "for every section," so each subsection (a), (b), (c) are part of Sec. 100003. So the summary should cover all parts. So the key is the $550 fee for each category, and the disposition of funds. So the summary should mention the three categories and their respective fund dispositions.

Sec. 100004: Immigration Parole Fee. $1,000 initial (or higher), annual inflation adjustments. All fees to general fund, except for specific exceptions (medical emergencies, family reunification, etc.). So: "Sec. 100004 imposes a $1,000 parole fee (or higher) on aliens paroled into the U.S., adjusted annually for inflation, with all proceeds deposited into the general fund, except for exceptions including medical emergencies, family reunification, and law enforcement assistance."

Sec. 100005: Special Immigrant Juvenile Fee. $250 initial (or higher), annual inflation adjustments. All fees to general fund. So: "Sec. 100005 establishes a $250 fee (or higher) for special immigrant juvenile status applications, adjusted annually for inflation, with all proceeds deposited into the general fund, applicable to aliens, parents, or legal guardians."

Sec. 100006: Temporary Protected Status Fee. Amends INA to increase fee from $50 to $500, with annual inflation adjustments. All fees to general fund. So: "Sec. 100006 amends INA to raise the TPS fee from $50 to $500 (adjusted annually for inflation), with all proceeds deposited into the general fund, effective FY2026."

Sec. 100007: Visa Integrity Fee. $250 initial (or higher), annual inflation adjustments. Reimbursement for nonimmigrant visas if conditions are met. So: "Sec. 100007 imposes a $250 visa integrity fee (or higher), adjusted annually for inflation, with reimbursement available for nonimmigrant visas if aliens comply with visa conditions and depart within 5 days, and remaining fees deposited into the general fund."

Sec. 100008: Form I-94 Fee. $24 initial (or higher), annual inflation adjustments. 20% to Land Border Inspection Fee Account, rest to general fund. So: "Sec. 100008 sets a $24 Form I-94 fee (or higher), adjusted annually for inflation, with 20% deposited into the Land Border Inspection Fee Account for CBP and the remainder into the general fund, without waivers."

Sec. 100009: Annual Asylum Fee. $100 initial (or higher), annual inflation adjustments. All fees to general fund. So: "Sec. 100009 requires an annual $100 asylum fee (or higher) per pending application year, adjusted annually for inflation, with all proceeds deposited into the general fund, no waivers allowed."

Sec. 100010: Fee for Renewal/Extension of Employment Authorization for Parolees. $275 initial (or higher), annual inflation adjustments. 25% to USCIS, rest to general fund. So: "Sec. 100010 imposes a $275 fee for parolee employment authorization renewals, adjusted annually for inflation, with 25% credited to USCIS (for fraud prevention) and the remainder to the general fund, no waivers."

Sec. 100011: Fee for Renewal/Extension of Employment Authorization for Asylum Applicants. $275 minimum. Termination upon asylum denial. 25% to USCIS, rest to general fund. So: "Sec. 100011 mandates a $275 fee for asylum applicant employment authorization renewals, with termination upon asylum denial, 25% credited to USCIS (for fraud prevention), and the remainder to the general fund, no waivers."

Sec. 100012: Fee for Renewal/Extension of Employment Authorization for TPS Holders. $275 initial (or higher), annual inflation adjustments. 25% to USCIS, rest to general fund. So: "Sec. 100012 sets a $275 fee for TPS employment authorization renewals, adjusted annually for inflation, with 25% credited to USCIS (for fraud prevention) and the remainder to the general fund, no waivers."

Sec. 100013: Fees for Adjustment of Status Applications. Multiple fees: $1,500 for adjustment, $1,050 for waiver, $500 for TPS, $900 for appeals, $1,325 for practitioner appeals, $900 for motions, $600 for suspension, $600 for cancellation (permanent), $1,500 for cancellation (non-permanent). All with 25% to EOIR, rest to general fund, and no use for Legal Orientation Program. So: "Sec. 100013 establishes multiple fees: $1,500 for adjustment of status, $1,050 for waiver of grounds, $500 for TPS applications, $900 for appeals, $1,325 for practitioner appeals, $900 for motions, $600 for suspension, and $1,500 for cancellation of removal, all adjusted annually for inflation, with 25% of each fee credited to the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) and the remainder to the general fund, excluding Legal Orientation Program funding."

Sec. 100014: Electronic System for Travel Authorization Fee. $10 minimum, $13 per authorization. Annual inflation adjustments. So: "Sec. 100014 increases the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) fee to $13 per travel authorization (from $10), with annual inflation adjustments starting FY2026, effective until October 31, 2034."

Wait, the original text says: "by adding at the end the following: ``(III) not less than $13 per travel authorization.'';" and "by striking ``October 31, 2028'' and inserting ``October 31, 2034'';". So the fee is $13, and the expiration is extended to 2034. So the summary should mention the $13 fee, annual adjustments, and the extended expiration date.

Sec. 100015: Electronic Visa Update System Fee. $30 initial (or higher), annual inflation adjustments. $5 per payment to general fund, rest to CBP Electronic Visa Update System Account. So: "Sec. 100015 sets a $30 Electronic Visa Update System (EVUS) fee (or higher), adjusted annually for inflation, with $5 per payment deposited into the general fund and the remainder into the CBP Electronic Visa Update System Account, no waivers."

Sec. 100016: Fee for Aliens Ordered Removed in Absentia. $5,000 initial (or higher), annual inflation adjustments. 50% to ICE (Detention and Removal Office Fee Account), 50% to general fund. Exception if order rescinded. So: "Sec. 100016 imposes a $5,000 fee on aliens ordered removed in absentia and subsequently arrested, adjusted annually for inflation, with 50% credited to ICE (Detention and Removal Office Fee Account) and 50% to the general fund, excluding rescinded orders."

Sec. 100017: Inadmissible Alien Apprehension Fee. $5,000 initial (or higher), annual inflation adjustments. 50% to ICE (Detention and Removal Office Fee Account), 50% to general fund. Wait, but the text has (d) saying all to general fund, but (c) says 50% to ICE. So the summary should reflect (c), as (d) is likely a typo. So: "Sec. 100017 levies a $5,000 fee on inadmissible aliens apprehended between ports of entry, adjusted annually for inflation, with 50% credited to ICE (Detention and Removal Office Fee Account) and 50% to the general fund, no waivers."

Sec. 100018: Amendment to Authority to Apply for Asylum. Changes "may" to "shall" for fee payment, removes limitation on additional fees. So: "Sec. 100018 amends INA to require asylum applicants to pay fees (replacing 'may' with 'shall') and removes restrictions on additional adjudication and naturalization fees set by the Attorney General."

Now moving to Part II: Immigration and Law Enforcement Funding.

Sec. 100051: Appropriation for DHS. $2,055,000,000 for FY2025, to be used for immigration enforcement, removals, personnel, background checks, etc. So: "Sec. 100051 appropriates $2.055 billion for DHS in FY2025, allocated to hiring CBP agents, removal costs, personnel assignments, background checks, child protection, and state/local partnerships, available through FY2029."

Sec. 100057: Appropriation for U.S. Secret Service. $1.17 billion for FY2025. So: "Sec. 100057 allocates $1.17 billion for the U.S. Secret Service in FY2025, funding personnel, training, and performance bonuses, available through FY2029."

Subtitle B: Judiciary Matters.

Sec. 100101: Appropriation to Administrative Office of U.S. Courts. $1.25 million for FY2025-2028. So: "Sec. 100101 appropriates $1.25 million annually for FY2025-2028 to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts for court docket analyses and reporting on non-party relief costs."

Sec. 100102: Appropriation to Federal Judicial Center. $1 million for FY2025-2028. So: "Sec. 100102 appropriates $1 million annually for FY2025-2028 to the Federal Judicial Center for judicial training on non-party relief claims and cost mitigation."

Subtitle C: Radiation Exposure Compensation.

Sec. 100201: Extension of Fund. Fund terminates Dec 31, 2028. So: "Sec. 100201 extends the Radiation Exposure Compensation Fund's termination date to December 31, 2028, from the previous end of a 2-year period."

Sec. 100202: Claims Relating to Atmospheric Testing. Increases leukemia and specified disease payments to $100,000. So: "Sec. 100202 raises compensation for leukemia and specified disease claims from $50,000/$75,000 to $100,000, extends physical presence periods, and adds new eligibility criteria for atmospheric testing claims."

Sec. 100203: Claims Relating to Uranium Mining. Expands definitions to include renal cancer and combined work histories. So: "Sec. 100203 expands uranium mining claims to include renal cancer, adds core drillers to covered roles, and introduces combined work history rules for eligibility."

Sec. 100205: Limitations on Claims. Extends deadline to Dec 31, 2027. So: "Sec. 100205 extends the deadline for filing radiation exposure claims to December 31, 2027, from the previous 2-year post-RECA Extension Act of 2022."

Now, I need to check each summary to ensure they're within one paragraph, max four sentences, specific on entities and quantities. Let me verify a few.

For Sec. 100002: "Sec. 100002 imposes a $100 asylum application fee (or higher in FY2025), adjusted annually for inflation, with 50% of proceeds credited to the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) and 50% to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), all without fee waivers." That's one sentence, which is good.

Sec. 100003: "Sec. 100003 sets $550 employment authorization fees (or higher) for asylum applicants, parolees, and Temporary Protected Status (TPS) holders, with 25% of asylum applicant fees credited to USCIS (50% for fraud prevention) and all other fees deposited into the general fund, all without waivers." Wait, the user said "for every section," so Sec. 100003 covers all three parts (a), (b), (c). So the summary should mention all three categories. The original text has (a) for asylum applicants, (b) for parolees, (c) for TPS. So the summary correctly lists all three.

Sec. 100004: "Sec. 100004 imposes a $1,000 parole fee (or higher) on aliens paroled into the U.S., adjusted annually for inflation, with all proceeds deposited into the general fund, except for exceptions including medical emergencies, family reunification, and law enforcement assistance." The exceptions are listed in subsection (b), so the summary mentions the key exceptions.

Sec. 100013: The summary lists all the fees. The user said "be specific as to parties, entities, and quantities." So listing the specific fees ($1,500, $1,050, etc.) is important. The summary does that.

Sec. 100018: "Sec. 100018 amends INA to require asylum applicants to pay fees (replacing 'may' with 'shall') and removes restrictions on additional adjudication and naturalization fees set by the Attorney General." Correct.

Now, check for conciseness. Each summary is one sentence, which is within the limit. The user said "at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences," so one sentence is fine.

Wait, the user said "Minimum 1 sentence." So one sentence is acceptable.

Check if all significant details are included. For example, in Sec. 100007, the reimbursement provision is mentioned. In Sec. 100015, the $5 per payment to general fund is included.

Wait, in Sec. 100015, the summary says "$5 per payment deposited into the general fund and the remainder into the CBP Electronic Visa Update System Account." The original text says: "an amount equal to $5 multiplied by the number of payments collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited to the general fund of the Treasury." So it's $5 per payment, not $5 total. So the summary is correct.

Another check: Sec. 100055 says "not to exceed $3,500,000,000," so the summary says "$3.5 billion," which is correct.

Sec. 100056: "$5 billion for the Bureau of Prisons in FY2025, with $3 billion for salaries/benefits and $2 billion for facility maintenance." Correct.

Sec. 100202: "raises compensation for leukemia and specified disease claims from $50,000/$75,000 to $100,000." The original text says "an individual who is described in subparagraph (A) shall receive $100,000" and "the amount of compensation for which the individual is eligible under paragraph (2)." So the previous amounts were $50k and $75k, now $100k. So the summary is accurate.

I think these summaries are concise, specific, and include all significant details. Now, I need to make sure they start with Sec. 100001 and go in order. Let me list them all as per the user's request.
