Need to ensure each is concise (1-4 sentences), specific on parties (DoD, NNSA, Services), entities (DARPA, Missile Defense Agency), quantities (dollar amounts, specific programs like F-15EX, B-21). Avoid vagueness, keep all significant details. Check that each section is covered starting from 20001.</seed:think>### Sec. 20001: Enhancement of Department of Defense (DoD) Resources for Military Quality of Life
