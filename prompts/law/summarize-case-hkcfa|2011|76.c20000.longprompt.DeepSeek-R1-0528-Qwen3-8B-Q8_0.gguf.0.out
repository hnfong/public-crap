Okay, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want a summary of a legal case, breaking it down into four parts: facts, arguments, legal principles, and something striking about the case. The user provided a detailed case document, so I need to parse through that information carefully.

First, I'll look at the facts. The case involves a contested will probate where the applicant claims a 2006 will is valid, but the foundation argues it's a forgery. The key points are the two wills, the trial's outcome, and the subsequent appeal. The user probably needs a concise yet comprehensive overview to grasp the scenario quickly.

Next, the arguments of the parties. The foundation counters the applicant's claim by arguing that the appeal doesn't meet the "as of right" criteria because it's not about a specific property claim. The applicant, on the other hand, uses multiple grounds: the as-of-right clause, important questions, or otherwise, and new evidence. I should highlight these distinct arguments clearly.

For the legal principles, the case discusses the narrow construction of section 22(1)(a) of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance. The main points here are the immediacy requirement and the rejection of the "as of right" application in probate cases. The user might be interested in how the court balances its role as a court of last resort with the need to avoid unnecessary litigation, so emphasizing that policy is crucial.

The striking aspect of the case is the foundation's argument about re-examining the "as of right" basis, which is unusual because it's a rare practice. Also, the detailed handling of witness evidence, especially the contradictions in the police statements, shows the court's thoroughness. The user might appreciate the insight into how the court's historical role influences current decisions.

I need to ensure that each section is addressed thoroughly but concisely. The user might be a law student or a legal professional looking for a clear breakdown of the case. They might need this for exam preparation, legal research, or understanding Hong Kong's judicial approach. The deeper need is to comprehend the legal standards for appeals in probate cases and how the court's discretion is exercised.

Also, the user might be interested in the practical implications of the court's decision, such as the importance of the immediacy requirement and the court's reluctance to entertain factual appeals. Highlighting the contrast between the foundation's and applicant's arguments could help them see the legal nuances. Mentioning the shift from the Privy Council to the current court's stance adds context about Hong Kong's legal evolution.

I should check if there are any novel points in the case. The foundation's argument about aligning with other Commonwealth jurisdictions is noteworthy. The court's emphasis on the "winner takes all" nature of probate cases and the rejection of artificial limitations on the appeal scope are key points. These might be of interest to someone studying legal precedent or jurisdictional differences.

Finally, ensuring that the summary is accurate and that the legal principles are correctly interpreted. The user might need to apply these principles in a similar case, so clarity is essential. The striking aspects should be highlighted to provide a memorable takeaway, perhaps noting the court's policy shift or the unique handling of witness evidence.

Okay, here is the summary based on the provided case text:

**1. Brief Summary of the Facts**

Mrs. Nina Wang died in 2007. Her will, dated July 2002, named the Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd ("the Foundation") as the sole beneficiary. The Applicant, Mr. Chan Chun Chuen, claimed that another will, dated October 2006, was valid and named in the text as the "2006 Will". This 2006 Will purported to leave her entire estate to him. The Foundation contested the validity of the 2006 Will, arguing it was a forgery. After a 40-day trial, Mr. Justice Lam found the 2006 Will to be a forgery. The Applicant appealed this decision to the Court of Appeal, which was dismissed. He then sought leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal (CFA). The CFA considered three grounds for granting leave: (a) the as-of-right ground based on the *China Field* interpretation of section 22(1)(a) of the CFAO, (b) the important question ground arguing the CFA should reconsider its approach to reviewing concurrent factual findings, and (c) the "or otherwise" ground, and also considered the possibility of discretionary leave based on new evidence. The CFA ultimately dismissed the application for leave to appeal.

**2. Brief Summary of the Arguments**

*   **Foundation (Respondent 1):** Argued that the appeal should be dismissed on the as-of-right grounds because the Applicant's claim was not for a specific property or proprietary right exceeding $1 million, but rather for a declaration regarding the will's validity. They contended that the *China Field* and *WLK v TMC* decisions were wrongly applied and should be overruled, as the case involved a "winner takes all" situation but the financial impact of the CFA's decision was not immediate or quantifiable due to the need for factual construction (Issue 9) before determining the estate's division. They also argued that the appeal should be dismissed on discretionary grounds because it did not raise an important question of general public importance and because the Court of Appeal's findings were concurrent and sound, with no miscarriage of justice. They further dismissed the new evidence ground, stating the police statements did not undermine crucial evidence regarding the "partial will" nature of the contested document.
*   **Applicant (Respondent 2):** Argued that the appeal should be granted as of right because it involved an indirect claim to the entire estate (a proprietary right of significant value), satisfying the broader interpretation from *Wang Din Shin* and *Mui Yim Fong*. Alternatively, he argued the CFA should grant leave on the important question ground, questioning the established practice of not reviewing concurrent factual findings unless there's a miscarriage of justice or critical error, citing the Privy Council's historical deference to local courts as outdated. He also sought leave on the "or otherwise" ground, claiming the Court of Appeal's decision was inadequate and failed to make relevant findings. Finally, he proposed the new evidence ground, suggesting police statements he became aware of this year showed contradictions in key witness evidence (Winfield Wong) that would likely prove a miscarriage of justice if considered.

**3. Detailed Summary of Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The case *Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v Chan Chun Chuen* [2011] HKCFA 76 established several key legal principles regarding appeals to the Court of Final Appeal (CFA):

*   **Narrow Construction of Section 22(1)(a) (As-of-Right Ground):** The CFA reaffirmed the need for a narrow interpretation of the "as of right" provisions in its statute. While the first limb of section 22(1)(a) clearly applies to liquidated monetary claims exceeding $1 million, the second limb ("directly or indirectly... property or civil right... of the value of $1 million or more") requires the claim to be for *some particular property or proprietary right* of that value. The mere possibility of an indirect financial impact is insufficient; the Court's order must immediately confer or impose a quantifiable financial benefit or detriment exceeding the threshold. This was crucial in distinguishing this case from earlier ones like *Wang Din Shin* and *Mui Yim Fong*, where the immediate financial consequence was the entire estate passing to the successful party. In this case, determining the validity of the 2006 Will required resolving Issue 9 (its partial nature), which necessitated further factual analysis and potentially apportionment, making the financial impact of the CFA's decision not immediately quantifiable. The CFA explicitly stated that the "as of right" ground is anomalous in modern legal systems and should be exceptional.
*   **Immediacy Requirement:** The core principle for the second limb is the "immediacy requirement". The Court's order must have an immediate financial effect on the parties. The Applicant's proposed order (pronouncing the 2006 Will valid) does not meet this because its immediate effect is not a quantified financial gain or loss; it necessitates further proceedings to determine the value of the estate portion passing to him. The CFA emphasized that the Privy Council's historical practice (deference to lower courts' findings) stems from this principle, aiming to balance the court's role as a court of last resort with the need for efficient litigation.
*   **Discretionary Leave (Important Question & Or Otherwise Grounds):** The CFA reiterated its firmly established practice against reviewing concurrent factual findings unless there is a miscarriage of justice or a critical violation of legal principles or procedure. This practice is based on compelling policy reasons: to prevent endless factual appeals, to respect the time and resources of the court, and to ensure finality. The court acknowledged that this practice, derived from Privy Council precedent, is not absolute but requires a strong justification, such as plain injustice or clear error. The "important question" ground was rejected because the case did not raise a question of great general or public importance warranting CFA intervention. The "or otherwise" ground was also rejected as the Court of Appeal's findings were deemed concurrent and adequate. The CFA emphasized that its function is not to revisit factual disputes but to determine points of law.
*   **New Evidence Ground:** The CFA considered the Applicant's argument that police statements, obtained later and not available during the trial, constituted fresh evidence meeting the *Ladd v Marshall* requirements. However, the court found these statements did not undermine the crucial factual findings regarding the "partial will" nature of the document. The statements were largely inadmissible or hypothetical opinions recorded by counsel (Mr. Sujanani) under the direction of the Applicant, not spontaneous evidence given by the Applicant. The Applicant's "recanting" arguments were deemed flawed, and the inconsistency regarding the beneficiary's full name was found to be inconsequential. Therefore, the new evidence did not provide exceptional grounds for review.
*   **Shift in Practice:** The judgment noted a significant shift in the legal landscape. All major commonwealth jurisdictions and the UK Supreme Court had moved away from the "as of right" basis for final appellate review, aligning with the CFA's own established practice. The CFA expressed its view that the "as of right" basis itself should be reconsidered, as it stems from the pre-1997 Privy Council regime and is no longer appropriate given this global trend and the public interest in maintaining the court's role as a court of last resort focused on legal principles, not factual disputes.

**4. Anything Striking, Unusual or Remarkable**

*   **The Foundation's Argument on "As of Right":** It was unusual for the losing party (the Foundation) to argue that the very basis for appeals to the CFA (the "as of right" clause) should be re-examined and potentially abolished, reflecting a broader awareness of the court's role and the trend away from this practice in other jurisdictions.
*   **Detailed Scrutiny of Witness Evidence:** The case involved a very detailed examination of the evidence presented by the witnesses (Ng Shun Mo and Winfield Wong) and the Applicant's attempts to use late-obtained police statements to challenge their credibility. The CFA meticulously dissected these arguments, highlighting the distinction between spontaneous observations and counsel-recorded hypotheticals.
*   **Contrast with Earlier CFA Decisions:** The CFA's decision in this case stands in stark contrast to its decisions in *Wang Din Shin* and *Mui Yim Fong*, where it had previously held that those cases met the "as of right" threshold due to the immediate financial impact of winning. This shows the court's ability to revisit its own precedent and refine its understanding of the statute's application.
*   **Public Interest Dimension:** The case touched upon the public interest aspect of the CFA's discretionary powers, implicitly questioning the continued relevance of the "as of right" provision in light of the global abandonment of such appeals by final courts. [end of text]
