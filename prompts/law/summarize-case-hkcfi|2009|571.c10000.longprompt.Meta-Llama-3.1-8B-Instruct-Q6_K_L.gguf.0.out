**1. Summary of Facts**

The case of HKSAR v. CHAN MING LOK [2009] HKCFI 571 involves an appeal by the defendant, Chan Ming Lok, against his conviction for possession of an offensive weapon under the Public Order Ordinance. The defendant was stopped by police officers in a public place in Hong Kong on June 29, 2008, and found to be carrying a knife. The police officers had been patrolling the area and had observed the defendant's suspicious behavior, including stopping and looking around several times. The defendant was asked why he had a knife and what he was doing in the area, but he did not provide a clear answer. He claimed that he carried the knife for self-defense, as he lived in Shenzhen and was afraid of being robbed. The defendant was subsequently charged and convicted of possession of an offensive weapon, and sentenced to 6 months' imprisonment.

**2. Summary of Arguments**

The defendant's lawyer, Mr. Wong, argued that the magistrate had wrongly concluded that the knife was an offensive weapon, as it was not clear which category of the definition of an offensive weapon the magistrate relied on. He suggested that the magistrate may have relied on the category of an article "suitable for causing injury to the person", which was not a valid category under the Public Order Ordinance. The prosecution, represented by Miss Lam, argued that the magistrate's findings were clear and that the knife was an offensive weapon under the definition in the Public Order Ordinance. She also argued that the defendant's intention to use the knife for self-defense in China did not provide a lawful authority or reasonable excuse for possessing it in Hong Kong.

**3. Summary of Legal Principles**

The case raises several novel and controversial legal principles, including the interpretation of the definition of an offensive weapon under the Public Order Ordinance. The court held that the definition of an offensive weapon in the Public Order Ordinance includes four categories: (a) an article made for causing injury to the person; (b) an article adapted for use for causing injury to the person; (c) an article suitable for causing injury to the person; and (d) an article intended by the person having it with him for use for causing injury to the person. However, the court noted that the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance may have the effect of repealing category (c), leaving only three categories of offensive weapons.

The court also considered the issue of whether the defendant's intention to use the knife for self-defense in China provided a lawful authority or reasonable excuse for possessing it in Hong Kong. The court held that the defendant's intention to use the knife for self-defense did not provide a lawful authority or reasonable excuse, as there was no evidence of imminent danger and the defendant's actions were not justified.

The court also considered the issue of sentence, and held that a sentence of 6 months' imprisonment was excessive, given the defendant's lack of prior convictions and the fact that the knife was a relatively small domestic knife. The court allowed the appeal against sentence and substituted a term of 4 months' imprisonment.

In terms of the ratio decidendi, the court held that:

* The definition of an offensive weapon in the Public Order Ordinance includes four categories, but the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance may have the effect of repealing category (c), leaving only three categories.
* The intention to use a knife for self-defense does not provide a lawful authority or reasonable excuse for possessing it in a public place, unless there is evidence of imminent danger.
* The court must consider the specific circumstances of the case, including the defendant's intentions and the potential consequences of possessing an offensive weapon, when determining sentence.
* A sentence of imprisonment for possession of an offensive weapon is not necessarily excessive, but must be proportionate to the offense and the defendant's circumstances.

Overall, the case highlights the importance of carefully considering the definition of an offensive weapon and the circumstances of each case when determining whether a defendant has a lawful authority or reasonable excuse for possessing a knife or other article. [end of text]
