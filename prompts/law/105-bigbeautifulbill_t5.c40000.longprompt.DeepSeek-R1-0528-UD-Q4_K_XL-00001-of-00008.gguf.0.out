Hmm, the user wants me to summarize every section of this complex energy and natural resources bill. They specifically mention it's championed by President Trump and recently passed, so I need to approach this neutrally while focusing on the legislative text. The bill appears to be a reconciliation act with significant changes to energy leasing, mining, and land management policies.

Looking at the structure, it's Title V from the Energy and Natural Resources Committee with five subtitles. The user wants concise summaries - maximum one paragraph of four sentences per section, keeping all significant details about parties, entities, and quantities. They specifically asked to start with Sec. 50101.

For Sec. 50101 about onshore oil and gas leasing: It repeals IRA provisions that increased royalty rates and restricted noncompetitive leasing. It mandates immediate resumption of quarterly lease sales in nine states (Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Nevada, Alaska), requiring at least 50% of nominated parcels be offered. It also sets new rules for lease processing timelines and drilling permits.

Sec. 50102 covers offshore leasing: It requires 30 lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico region between 2025-2040 and 6 in Alaska's Cook Inlet (2026-2028, 2030-2032). Specific acreage minimums are set (80M acres Gulf, 1M acres Alaska), with royalty rates capped at 16.67%. Alaska gets increased revenue sharing starting 2034.

Sec. 50103 is straightforward - it repeals the IRA's methane royalty provision entirely.

Sec. 50104 mandates four additional lease sales in Alaska's Coastal Plain by 2032, offering at least 400,000 acres per sale with increased revenue sharing for Alaska (50% 2025-2033, 70% thereafter).

Sec. 50105 requires five lease sales in NPR-A Alaska by 2035, offering 4M acres each, restoring 2020 environmental plans and giving Alaska 70% revenue share from 2034.

Moving to Subtitle B on mining: Sec. 50201 forces BLM to process pending coal lease applications within 90 days. Sec. 50202 temporarily caps coal royalties at 7% until 2034. Sec. 50203 makes 4M additional acres available for coal leasing, excluding protected areas. Sec. 50204 authorizes mining of federal coal adjacent to state/private reserves.

For Subtitle C lands provisions: Sec. 50301 mandates increased timber sales (250M board-feet more annually for Forest Service, 20M for BLM) and long-term contracts. Sec. 50302 establishes new fee formulas for renewable energy projects on federal land. Sec. 50303 allocates 25% of renewable energy revenues to states and 25% to counties. Sec. 50304 rescinds $ from IRA conservation programs. Sec. 50305 appropriates $150M for America's 250th anniversary.

In Subtitle D energy: Sec. 50401 funds SPR maintenance ($218M) and petroleum purchases ($171M) while repealing a drawdown mandate. Sec. 50402 repeals and rescinds multiple IRA energy programs. Sec. 50403 expands DOE loan guarantees for energy projects and adds $1B funding. Sec. 50404 provides $150M for AI modeling of energy research.

Finally, Subtitle E's Sec. 50501 appropriates $1B for Bureau of Reclamation water infrastructure projects.

I'll organize these summaries section by section as requested, ensuring each is concise but packed with the key details about requirements, quantities, and affected parties. Since this is legislation, I'll maintain precise language about what each provision mandates or changes.
