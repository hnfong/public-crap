The user wants a summary of the changes for every section "Sec. XXXX" in the bill. The bill is a huge one, championed by President Donald Trump, passed by Congress recently. The user wants specific details: parties, entities, quantities, and concise but not vague. Minimum 1 sentence, maximum 4 sentences per section. Start with Sec. 10101.

The bill is the "An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of H. Con. Res. 14." It's a reconciliation bill. The user wants a summary for each section. The bill is huge, so I need to go through each section and provide a concise summary.

The bill is from the 119th Congress, as indicated by "119th Congress" in the text. The user mentions "recently passed by Congress". The date in the header is July 1, 2025. So it's a future bill? Or a hypothetical? The user says "championed by President Donald Trump". But the date is 2025. Trump is not president in 2025 (he was 2017-2021). So this is a hypothetical or a future bill. The user wants a summary of the changes. I should treat it as a real bill text and summarize each section.

The bill is titled "An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of H. Con. Res. 14." This is a reconciliation bill, likely focusing on agriculture and nutrition. The table of contents shows it's primarily about agriculture, nutrition, forestry, commodities, disaster assistance, crop insurance, rural America investments, etc.

I need to go through each section from Sec. 10101 to Sec. 10607. The user wants a summary for each.
