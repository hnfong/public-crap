## Summary of *Secretary for Justice v. Chan Chi Wan Stephen* [2017] HKCFA 15

Here's a breakdown of the case, following your requested structure:

**1. Facts of the Case**

Stephen Chan Chi Wan (Chan) was a General Manager at Television Broadcasts Ltd (TVB), responsible for broadcasting but not required to appear on camera. He voluntarily hosted a popular talk show, “Be My Guest,” on a TVB pay channel, receiving no extra pay from TVB for this.  His popularity led to external event invitations, and between 2008-2010, he accepted 18 paid appearances through his agent, Idea Empire Advertising & Production Company Limited (IEAP).

Olympian City (OC) sponsored a New Year’s Eve Countdown show produced by TVB. They agreed to pay $1.3 million, but this didn’t cover additional segments. OC and TVB agreed to include a live edition of “Be My Guest” hosted by Chan. OC contacted IEAP to secure Chan’s participation, agreeing to pay $160,000. IEAP would then pay Chan $112,000 and Lai Yiu Cheung $20,000, keeping $28,000 as commission. Chan didn’t seek TVB’s permission, despite contractual requirements, but TVB was generally aware of his involvement.  Chan performed the show, and all parties received their agreed payments.

Chan and Tseng Pei Kun (Tseng, the director of IEAP) were charged with conspiracy to accept an advantage and substantive offences under the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO). The prosecution argued Chan accepted a bribe for performing a show related to TVB’s business.

**2. Arguments of the Parties**

*   **Prosecution:** Chan accepted an advantage ($112,000) from Tseng/IEAP as an inducement for performing on the “Be My Guest” segment of the Countdown show. This performance was “in relation to” TVB’s affairs or business, triggering the POBO offence, even though Chan wasn’t directly instructed by TVB for this specific appearance.  They argued that Chan’s participation benefited TVB (boosting ratings) and that the fact he didn’t seek permission was evidence of wrongdoing. They focused on the idea that the act *related to* TVB’s business, even if not directly *for* TVB.
*   **Defence:** Chan’s appearance was a personal engagement, a form of “moonlighting.” He wasn’t acting as TVB’s agent in this instance. The payment was for his celebrity status, not for influencing TVB’s business.  The fact that TVB was aware of the appearance didn’t mean it was done *on behalf of* TVB. They argued that Chan had a reasonable excuse, as his actions didn’t harm TVB and were generally known within the company. They emphasized that Chan’s participation was beneficial to TVB, not detrimental.  They also argued that the prosecution needed to prove Chan *intended* to influence TVB’s affairs.

**3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The core legal issue revolved around the interpretation of Section 9 of the POBO, specifically the phrase “in relation to his principal’s affairs or business.” The Court of Final Appeal clarified several key principles:

*   **Mens Rea Requirement:** Section 9 requires proof of *mens rea* (guilty mind) for all elements of the offence. This means the prosecution must prove the agent *knew or believed* the advantage was provided as an inducement or reward for an act related to the principal’s business. For the offeror, the prosecution must prove they *intended* the advantage to be accepted as such an inducement.
*   **Restrictive Interpretation of “In Relation To”:** The phrase “in relation to his principal’s affairs or business” is *restrictive*. It’s not enough that the agent is simply *an* agent; the act must have a connection to the principal’s business. This principle stems from the Privy Council case *Commissioner of ICAC v Ch’ng Poh* [1997] HKLRD 652, which held that the act must be “aimed at” and “intended to influence or affect” the principal’s affairs.
*   **The Need for a Nexus:** The act or forbearance must have a causal relationship with the principal’s affairs.  The prosecution must demonstrate that the agent’s action was intended to influence or affect the principal’s business.  Simply being an employee doesn’t automatically mean any external activity is “in relation to” the employer’s business.
*   **Adverse Impact Not Required, But Integrity of Agency Relationship is Key:** The Court rejected the argument that the act must be *detrimental* to the principal’s interests. However, it emphasized that the act must undermine the integrity of the agency relationship. The focus is on whether the agent’s conduct subverts the trust and loyalty owed to the principal.  A beneficial act, congruent with the principal’s interests, is unlikely to be a section 9 offence.
*   **Reasonable Excuse:** The defence of “reasonable excuse” requires a genuine belief that permission would have been granted. The test is objective, considering the specific facts of the case and the purpose of the POBO.  The burden of proof lies on the accused to establish this excuse.
*   **Conspiracy and the Reverse Onus:** The Court clarified that the reverse onus provision in section 24 (requiring the accused to prove reasonable excuse) does *not* apply to conspiracy charges.  To prove conspiracy to commit a section 9 offence, the prosecution must prove the underlying act would necessarily amount to a section 9 offence, including the requirement of a reasonable excuse.

**In essence, the Court held that Chan’s actions did not meet the threshold for a section 9 offence because the prosecution failed to prove that his performance was aimed at influencing TVB’s affairs or business in a way that undermined the integrity of his agency relationship.**  The fact that the performance was beneficial to TVB, and that Chan didn’t act with the intention of harming the company, were crucial factors.



**4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case**

Several aspects of this case are noteworthy:

*   **The Narrow Interpretation of Corruption:** The case highlights the surprisingly narrow scope of the POBO’s application to private sector corruption. The removal of the “corruptly” requirement, intended to make prosecution easier, actually led to a stricter interpretation of the “in relation to” clause.
*   **The Focus on Intent:** The emphasis on the agent’s *intent* is significant. The prosecution couldn’t prove Chan intended to influence TVB’s affairs, even though his actions had a positive effect.
*   **The “Moonlighting” Scenario:** The case provides guidance on the boundaries of acceptable external activities for employees. It clarifies that not all side jobs are automatically considered breaches of fiduciary duty.
*   **The Debate Over Agency:** The case sparked a debate about what constitutes acting “as an agent.” The Court rejected the idea that simply being an employee is sufficient to trigger the POBO.
*   **The Practical Implications:** The case has implications for employers and employees. Employers need to clearly define the scope of their employees’ duties and the rules regarding outside work. Employees need to be aware of their fiduciary obligations and the potential consequences of accepting undisclosed benefits.
*   **The Disconnect in Reasoning:** The initial Court of Appeal decision, finding Chan guilty based on the idea that TVB *might* have been prejudiced if he refused to perform, seems counterintuitive and highlights the dangers of extending the scope of criminal liability too broadly. The CFA rightly corrected this.
* **The Lengthy Litigation:** The case went through multiple appeals, demonstrating the complexity of interpreting anti-bribery legislation and the importance of establishing clear legal principles.
