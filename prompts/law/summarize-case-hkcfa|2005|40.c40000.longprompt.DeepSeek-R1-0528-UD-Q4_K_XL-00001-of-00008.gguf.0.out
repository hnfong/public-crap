Hmm, the user has provided a lengthy legal judgment from Hong Kong's Court of Final Appeal and asked me to analyze it in four specific parts. This is a complex constitutional case about freedom of assembly and the Public Order Ordinance.

First, I need to understand the core dispute. The appellants were convicted for holding an unauthorized protest procession without notifying police. They challenged the constitutionality of the entire regulatory scheme, arguing it gave too much discretion to police to restrict assemblies.

The facts are straightforward: In 2002, about 40-96 people marched from Chater Garden to Police Headquarters protesting an activist's conviction. They deliberately didn't notify police despite warnings, leading to convictions under Section 17A.

For arguments: The appellants claimed the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague, especially regarding "public order (ordre public)" as grounds for restriction. The government defended it as necessary and sufficiently precise.

The legal principles section is crucial. The majority upheld the scheme but severed "ordre public" to only cover traditional "public order" (law and order). They established that restrictions must satisfy two tests: "prescribed by law" (legal certainty) and "necessity" (proportionality test). The proportionality test here is interesting - it only requires rational connection and minimal impairment, unlike the three-step test elsewhere.

Bokhary PJ's dissent is remarkable - he'd strike down the entire prior restraint system as insufficiently circumscribed. His historical perspective on assembly rights is particularly eloquent.

What's striking? The court creatively used severance to save the law, and Bokhary's fiery dissent comparing vague laws to "crooked cords of discretion" stands out. Also notable how the court balanced Hong Kong's dense urban environment with fundamental rights.

The user seems legally trained - perhaps a law student or practitioner researching constitutional challenges. They want both factual summary and deep legal analysis, especially on novel aspects like the truncated proportionality test. I'll structure the response to highlight these elements while keeping summaries concise.

### 1. **Brief Summary of Facts**  
On 10 February 2002, approximately 40–96 individuals (including the appellants) held a public procession from Chater Garden to Police Headquarters in Hong Kong to protest the conviction of an activist. The procession was peaceful but violated the Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245) by:  
- Failing to notify the police 7 days in advance (s. 13A).  
- Ignoring police advice to use pedestrian pavements and avoid congested areas.  
The appellants were convicted: Leung Kwok Hung (1st appellant) for "holding an unauthorized assembly," and others (2nd/3rd appellants) for "assisting" it under s. 17A(3)(b)(i). They challenged the constitutionality of the Ordinance, arguing it infringed the right to peaceful assembly under Hong Kong’s Basic Law and Bill of Rights.

### 2. **Summary of Arguments**  
**Appellants' Arguments:**  
- The Ordinance granted the Commissioner of Police overly broad discretion to restrict assemblies under "public order (ordre public)," violating the constitutional requirement that restrictions be "prescribed by law" (lacking legal certainty).  
- The term "ordre public" was vague and could justify arbitrary restrictions on peaceful protests.  
- The statutory scheme disproportionately limited freedom of assembly, failing the "necessity in a democratic society" test.  

**Respondent's (HKSAR Government) Arguments:**  
- The Ordinance was constitutional, as restrictions were necessary for public safety, order, and others' rights.  
- "Public order (ordre public)" was sufficiently defined by international standards (ICCPR) and judicial interpretation.  
- The Commissioner’s discretion was constrained by:  
  - Proportionality requirements.  
  - Statutory time limits for objections/conditions.  
  - Rights of appeal and judicial review.

### 3. **Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**  
#### **I. Fundamental Rights Framework**  
- **Freedom of Peaceful Assembly** is a core democratic right under **Article 27 of the Basic Law** and **Article 17 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights (BORO)**, linked to freedom of speech. It enables public dialogue, minority expression, and redress of grievances.  
- **Restrictions Must Satisfy Two Constitutional Tests**:  
  1. **"Prescribed by Law"**: Restrictions must be clear, accessible, and precise enough for citizens to regulate conduct (*Shum Kwok Sher* applied).  
  2. **"Necessity in a Democratic Society"**: Restrictions must be proportionate to legitimate aims (national security, public safety, public order, others' rights).  

#### **II. Proportionality Test**  
- **Hong Kong’s Modified Approach**: Unlike jurisdictions requiring a three-step test (e.g., *De Freitas*), Hong Kong’s test has **two limbs** due to the exhaustive list of legitimate aims in the ICCPR/BORO:  
  1. **Rational Connection**: The restriction must advance a legitimate aim (e.g., public order).  
  2. **Minimal Impairment**: The means used must be the least restrictive to achieve the aim.  
- **Government’s Positive Duty**: Authorities must take reasonable steps to *facilitate* peaceful assemblies (e.g., traffic management), not merely avoid interference (*Plattform ‘Ärzte für das Leben v. Austria*).  

#### **III. Constitutionality of the Ordinance**  
- **"Public Order (Ordre Public)" as Unconstitutionally Vague**:  
  - At the **statutory level**, empowering the Commissioner to restrict assemblies based on "ordre public" (a broad, elusive concept encompassing "fundamental societal principles") lacked sufficient precision. This violated the "prescribed by law" requirement.  
  - **Severance Remedy**: The term "ordre public" was severed from ss. 14(1), 14(5), and 15(2). Only "public order" (narrowly defined as *preventing disorder and maintaining law and order*) remained valid.  
- **Surviving Provisions**:  
  - **Notification Requirement**: Upheld as constitutional (enables police to fulfill positive duty).  
  - **Discretion Based on "Public Order"**: Valid if applied proportionally (e.g., rational traffic/crowd control).  
  - **Appeals & Judicial Review**: The Appeal Board and courts must ensure proportionality is applied.  

#### **IV. Dissent (Bokhary PJ)**  
- **Prior Restraint Powers Unconstitutional**: The Commissioner’s powers to ban/restrict assemblies under vague grounds ("ordre public," "rights of others") were insufficiently circumscribed, risking arbitrary suppression.  
- **Stricter Certainty Required**: Laws restricting fundamental rights must be "clearly and carefully circumscribed" to avoid chilling legitimate dissent.  
- **Notification Valid, But Criminal Sanctions Invalid**: s. 17A offenses were struck down as inseparable from the unconstitutional prior-restraint regime.

### 4. **Striking/Unusual Aspects**  
1. **Severance of "Ordre Public"**: The Court creatively excised an unconstitutional element ("ordre public") while preserving the Ordinance’s core, avoiding full invalidation—a rare judicial remedy in constitutional challenges.  
2. **Bokhary PJ’s Fiery Dissent**: The dissent invoked historical and global precedents (e.g., U.S. civil rights cases, German constitutional law) to argue that vague laws empower "tyranny," emphasizing that Hong Kong’s freedoms stem from "pain and anguish" of past struggles.  
3. **"Positive Duty" Innovation**: The Court affirmed that the government must *actively enable* peaceful protests (e.g., traffic control), moving beyond passive non-interference—a progressive expansion of state obligations.  
4. **Contextual Sensitivity**: The majority acknowledged Hong Kong’s "density of population and narrow streets" to justify notification rules, balancing rights with practical realities.  
5. **Contrast with International Standards**: The truncated proportionality test (omitting "sufficiently important objective") diverged from Commonwealth models, tailoring scrutiny to Hong Kong’s constitutional text.  

**Final Note**: The case underscores Hong Kong’s struggle to reconcile civil liberties with public order post-1997, reflecting tensions inherent in its hybrid common law/international human rights framework. [end of text]
