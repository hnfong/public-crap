### 1. Summary of Facts

The appellant, So Ping Chi, was a senior public officer serving as the General Manager and Principal Surveyor of Ships of the Local Vessel Safety Branch (LVSB) within the Marine Department of the HKSAR Government from April 2007 to August 2010. His duties included enforcing the *Merchant Shipping (Local Vessels) (Safety and Survey) Regulation* (Cap 548G), which came into force on January 2, 2007. This regulation mandated that vessels carry 100% adult lifejackets and 5% children's lifejackets, a significant increase from the previous requirement of 40% lifejackets with no specific provision for children.

The prosecution alleged that the appellant, concerned about the financial burden the new regulations would place on vessel operators, issued a "non-enforcement instruction" to his subordinates. This instruction directed inspectors not to enforce the new children's lifejacket requirements for "old vessels" (those licensed before January 2, 2007), effectively continuing a policy started by his predecessor. The appellant failed to rescind this instruction during his entire tenure, and it remained in place until after a fatal ferry collision near Lamma Island in October 2012, which triggered a Commission of Inquiry that exposed the practice.

The appellant was convicted of misconduct in public office for wilfully failing to enforce the law and sentenced to 16 months' imprisonment. He appealed against both conviction and sentence. The Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal against conviction but allowed the appeal against sentence, reducing it to time already served.

### 2. Summary of Arguments

**Appellant's Arguments:**
*   **Mental Element (Ground 7):** The appellant argued that for misconduct to be criminal, it must be accompanied by a dishonest, corrupt, or malicious motive. He relied on the distinction drawn in *Shum Kwok Sher v HKSAR* between "nonfeasance" (where wilful intent suffices) and "misfeasance/malfeasance" (where an improper motive is required). He contended his case was the latter, as he was exercising discretion, and thus lacked the necessary improper motive.
*   **Wilfulness and Seriousness (Ground 4):** He argued the trial judge failed to consider his subjective state of mind and the actual consequences of his actions. He claimed the safety difference between the old and new laws was negligible (as adult lifejackets could serve children), and therefore the misconduct was not "serious" enough to warrant criminal sanction.
*   **Reasonable Excuse (Grounds 8 & 9):** He argued he had a reasonable excuse to ensure the "smooth implementation" of the law and appease the industry to prevent business closures. He also argued that the lack of actual harm (due to the adequacy of old equipment) meant there was no justification for criminal punishment.
*   **Sentence:** He argued the 16-month sentence was manifestly excessive given his exemplary character, lack of personal gain, and the fact that he inherited the policy rather than creating it.

**Respondent's (Prosecution) Arguments:**
*   **Mental Element:** The prosecution argued that the appellant's case was one of "nonfeasance" (a deliberate failure to perform a statutory duty), where a dishonest motive is not required. The mere deliberate non-performance of a duty, without reasonable excuse, is sufficient if the misconduct is serious.
*   **Wilfulness and Seriousness:** They submitted that the test for seriousness is objective: would a right-thinking member of the public consider the conduct an abuse of public trust? The appellant knew the facts; it was for the jury to decide if they were serious. The deliberate substitution of the appellant's view for the legislature's will was inherently serious.
*   **Reasonable Excuse:** Appeasing the industry or ensuring "smooth implementation" is not a valid legal excuse for ignoring statutory safety requirements. The appellant had no authority to exempt vessels and failed to seek advice from superiors or the Department of Justice.
*   **Sentence:** The sentence was appropriate given the seniority of the office, the importance of public safety, and the erosion of public trust. The fact that he inherited the policy did not mitigate the culpability of continuing it.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**The Mental Element of Misconduct in Public Office: Nonfeasance vs. Misfeasance**
A central legal principle established and clarified in this case concerns the mental element required for the common law offence of misconduct in public office. The Court of Appeal addressed the appellant's reliance on *Shum Kwok Sher v HKSAR*, which distinguished between different forms of misconduct. The Court clarified that the requirement for a "dishonest, corrupt, or malicious motive" depends on the nature of the breach.

In cases of **misfeasance** (where a public officer exercises a power or discretion lawfully but does so with an improper motive, such as to benefit oneself or harm another), the prosecution must prove the existence of that improper motive. However, in cases of **nonfeasance** (the deliberate failure to perform a public duty), the mental element is satisfied by a "wilful intent" accompanied by the absence of a reasonable excuse or justification. The Court held that the appellant's conduct fell squarely into the category of nonfeasance. By issuing an instruction to his subordinates not to enforce a statutory safety requirement, he deliberately failed to perform his duty. Consequently, the prosecution did not need to prove he acted with a corrupt or malicious motive; it was sufficient to prove he deliberately chose not to enforce the law without a reasonable excuse.

**The Objective Test for "Seriousness"**
The Court reaffirmed the test for the "seriousness" of the misconduct, which is a necessary element for criminal liability. The Court adopted the approach from English authorities (*R v Chapman*, *R v France*) and the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal (*Sin Kam Wah v HKSAR*). The test is objective: the misconduct must be such that a "right-thinking member of the public" would conclude it amounts to an abuse of the public trust.

Crucially, the Court held that it is **not necessary** for the prosecution to prove that the public officer *subjectively* appreciated that his conduct was serious or that he intended to abuse the public trust. It is sufficient to prove that the officer knew the facts and circumstances that would lead a right-thinking member of the public to conclude the conduct was serious. The assessment of whether the conduct was "serious" is a matter for the jury (or judge in a summary trial), not the defendant. In this case, the deliberate non-enforcement of life-saving regulations by a senior official was objectively serious, regardless of the appellant's personal belief that the safety difference was negligible.

**Reasonable Excuse and the Limits of Discretion**
The judgment clarifies what constitutes a "reasonable excuse" for non-performance of duty. The Court rejected the appellant's argument that "smooth implementation" of the law or appeasing the industry constituted a reasonable excuse. The Court emphasized that a public officer has no authority to unilaterally decide that a statutory requirement should not be enforced, even if they believe the law is impractical or that the old law was sufficient.

A reasonable excuse requires more than a subjective belief; it requires a legitimate basis, such as a lack of resources (if authorized) or a genuine misunderstanding of the law that is objectively reasonable. Here, the appellant knew he had no power to exempt vessels, knew his superior did have such power, and failed to consult either his superior or legal advisors. Therefore, his decision to substitute his own judgment for the legislature's will, without authority, could not be a reasonable excuse. The Court stressed that "appeasement of the industry is not a reasonable excuse" for ignoring safety legislation.

**The "Wilful" Nature of the Act**
The Court defined "wilful" in this context as "deliberate." It is not enough to show negligence or inadvertence. The appellant must have voluntarily and deliberately chosen not to perform the duty. The Court found that the appellant's failure to rescind the instruction was not a case of forgetting or negligence; he had the opportunity and authority to stop the practice but chose to continue it for the duration of his tenure. This deliberate continuation solidified the "wilful" element of the offence.

**Novelty and Controversy**
While the distinction between nonfeasance and misfeasance is not new, the application of this distinction to a case where the officer acted out of a desire to "help" the industry rather than for personal gain is significant. It reinforces the principle that the *motivation* of the officer (even if benign or well-intentioned) is irrelevant to the *culpability* of the act if the act itself is a deliberate breach of statutory duty without authority. The case serves as a stark reminder that public officers cannot unilaterally suspend the law, even for pragmatic reasons, and that the "public trust" is breached by the mere act of ignoring the law, regardless of the officer's subjective intent.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

The most striking and remarkable aspect of this case is the **disparity in criminal liability among the public officers involved**.

The Court of Appeal explicitly noted that the non-enforcement policy was not created by the appellant but was inherited from his predecessor. Furthermore, the policy was continued by **two of his successors** after he left office. Despite all four officers (the predecessor, the appellant, and the two successors) implementing the exact same unlawful instruction for a period spanning several years, **only the appellant was prosecuted and convicted criminally.**

The Court highlighted that the predecessor faced no disciplinary or criminal proceedings, and the two successors faced only disciplinary action (warning letters). The Court of Appeal found this situation "unusual" and noted that the fact that the successors had "escaped a criminal prosecution" was a valid consideration for sentencing. The Court of Appeal even went so far as to urge the civil service not to treat the appellant more harshly than his colleagues, acknowledging that "there was nothing to distinguish the applicant, morally or legally, from those who succeeded him in his post."

This raises profound questions about **selective prosecution** and **fairness**. It is highly unusual for a systemic, long-standing policy violation involving multiple senior officials to result in criminal conviction for only one individual, while others involved in the same conduct face no criminal consequences. The Court's decision to reduce the sentence to time already served (effectively releasing him immediately) was a direct response to this perceived unfairness, acknowledging that while the law was broken, the criminal sanction was disproportionately applied to one person in a chain of command where others were let off. This aspect of the case serves as a rare judicial commentary on the inequities of the criminal justice system's application to public officials. [end of text]
