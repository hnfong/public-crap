Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants me to summarize the case facts, arguments, legal principles, and then note anything striking about the case. First, I need to go through the provided judgment carefully.

Starting with the facts: The case is about a probate dispute where the plaintiff, a charitable foundation, is challenging the validity of a 2006 will, which the first defendant claims is Nina Wang's last will. The 2002 will is valid, and the 2006 will is alleged to be a forgery. The key points are Nina Wang's relationship with the first defendant, the evidence of the wills, the expert testimony on handwriting, and the court's findings on the 2006 will being a forgery. Also, the first defendant's history with Nina Wang, including their relationship, financial transactions, and the role of the attesting witnesses.

Next, the arguments of the two parties. The plaintiff argues that the 2006 will is a forgery, citing the discrepancies in the attesting witnesses' evidence, the handwriting analysis, and the context of Nina Wang's intentions. The first defendant, on the other hand, claims that the 2006 will is genuine, asserting that Nina Wang wanted to leave him all her estate and that the witnesses were not reliable. They also argue that the judge didn't properly consider the inherent improbabilities and the relationship between Nina Wang and the first defendant.

For the legal principles, the ratio decidendi would involve the court's determination that the 2006 will is a forgery based on the evidence from the attesting witnesses and the handwriting analysis. The court emphasized the importance of considering inherent improbabilities in will forgery cases, which is a key point. Also, the analysis of handwriting evidence, including the use of statistical methods and the distinction between similarities and differences, is crucial. The court rejected the first defendant's arguments about the significance of the relationship and the use of hospital signatures, highlighting the need for strict scrutiny of expert evidence. The court also addressed the issue of costs, finding that the first defendant's actions were dishonest and thus costs should be on an indemnity basis.

Now, the striking aspects. The case is notable for the detailed forensic analysis of the will's authenticity, including the scientific examination of the signature over a crease. The first defendant's relationship with Nina Wang, which was kept secret, adds a personal element. The court's rejection of the first defendant's claims about the relationship being a factor in the will's validity is significant. Also, the court's emphasis on the importance of expert evidence and the statistical approach in handwriting analysis is a novel application of those principles in a probate case. The costs order being on an indemnity basis due to the first defendant's dishonesty is another remarkable point, as it's a strong punitive measure.

I need to make sure each section is covered thoroughly, especially the legal principles part. The user might be interested in how the court handled the expert testimony and the implications of the first defendant's actions. Also, the case's unique aspects like the use of scientific evidence and the personal relationship between the parties could be highlighted. I should check if there are any specific legal precedents mentioned, like the Court of Final Appeal's previous decisions, and how they were applied here. The court's detailed analysis of the 6 inherent improbabilities and the statistical approach in the handwriting examination are key points that might be novel or controversial.

### 1. **Facts of the Case**  
The case involves a probate dispute over the wills of Nina Wang, the late chairwoman of the Chinachem Group. The plaintiff, a charitable foundation (Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd), seeks to have the court pronounce the validity of the 2002 will, which bequeaths Nina Wang’s estate to the foundation, and to invalidate the 2006 will, which the first defendant (Chan Chun Chuen) claims is Nina Wang’s last will, leaving her estate to him. The 2002 will is undisputed as valid, but the 2006 will is contested. Key facts include:  
- **Nina Wang’s relationship with the first defendant**: They were introduced in 1992 as lovers, though the first defendant was married and had children. Their relationship was kept secret for years, with Nina Wang expressing interest in his "fung shui" services to locate her husband Teddy Wang, who was kidnapped in 1990 and presumed dead.  
- **Financial transactions**: Nina Wang made substantial payments to the first defendant, including $720 million in gifts between 1993 and 1997, and later $688 million to a company linked to him. These payments were made despite her continued support for the plaintiff and her 2002 will.  
- **Evidence of the 2006 will**: The 2006 will was signed by Nina Wang and witnessed by Mr. Winfield Wong (a solicitor) and Mr. Ng Shung Mo (a Chinachem employee). However, the attesting witnesses later contradicted their testimony, stating that the document they witnessed was a partial will (not the full estate) and that the 2006 will was a forgery.  
- **Scientific evidence**: Expert handwriting analysis revealed that the 2006 will’s signature of Mr. Wong was forged, while Nina Wang’s signature was a highly skilled simulation. The document also showed the signature was written over a crease in the paper, a detail not evident to the naked eye.  
- **Context of the 2006 will**: The first defendant claimed Nina Wang wanted to leave him all her estate and make him a board member of Chinachem companies. However, the court found that Nina Wang had never deviated from her intent to leave her wealth to the plaintiff, and the 2006 will was a deliberate forgery by the first defendant to secure his own financial gain.

### 2. **Arguments of the Two Parties**  
**Plaintiff (Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd)**:  
- Argued that the 2006 will was a forgery, citing the conflicting evidence of the attesting witnesses (Mr. Wong and Mr. Ng) and the handwriting analysis.  
- Contended that the first defendant’s claims about the 2006 will were based on a fabricated relationship with Nina Wang, which was kept secret and lacked permanency.  
- Emphasized that Nina Wang had always intended to leave her estate to the plaintiff, as evidenced by her continued involvement with the foundation and the 2002 will.  
- Highlighted the first defendant’s dishonesty, including his false testimony about his education and his attempt to manipulate the court by producing a forged will.  

**First Defendant (Chan Chun Chuen)**:  
- Argued that the 2006 will was genuine, asserting that Nina Wang treated him as her husband and wanted to leave her estate to him.  
- Claimed that the judge failed to consider the "inherent improbabilities" of the case, such as the first defendant’s lack of knowledge of fung shui, the inconsistency in the attesting witnesses’ evidence, and the fact that the 2006 will was prepared after Nina Wang’s cancer diagnosis.  
- Argued that the judge’s reliance on the attesting witnesses’ testimony was flawed, as they had previously testified that the 2006 will was a partial will, not the full estate.  
- Contended that the court should not have dismissed the first defendant’s evidence about the relationship, which was central to Nina Wang’s intent.

### 3. **Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**  
The court’s decision in **CHINACHEM CHARITABLE FOUNDATION LTD v. CHAN CHUN CHUEN AND ANOTHER** hinges on several key legal principles, many of which are novel or controversial in the context of probate law and forensic evidence.  

#### **A. The Burden of Proof in Will Forgery Cases**  
The court emphasized that the burden of proof for will forgery lies heavily on the party alleging forgery. The first defendant’s claim that the 2006 will was genuine required the court to scrutinize the evidence with meticulous care. The judge rejected the first defendant’s argument that the 2006 will was a "partial will" or codicil, noting that the attesting witnesses’ evidence contradicted this, and that the document’s structure (e.g., the signature over a crease) was inconsistent with a genuine will. The court held that the first defendant’s failure to produce credible evidence of the will’s authenticity rendered his claim invalid.  

#### **B. Inherent Improbabilities in Will Forgery**  
The court acknowledged the importance of "inherent improbabilities" in assessing the authenticity of a will. These include factors such as the likelihood of a person being able to forge a will, the consistency of the document with the deceased’s known behavior, and the credibility of the attesting witnesses. The judge meticulously analyzed these improbabilities, including the first defendant’s lack of knowledge of fung shui, his false testimony about his education, and the fact that the 2006 will was prepared after Nina Wang’s cancer diagnosis. The court concluded that the first defendant’s actions were "deliberate" and "dishonest," making the 2006 will a forgery.  

#### **C. Expert Handwriting Analysis and Statistical Significance**  
The court’s analysis of handwriting evidence was highly detailed and relied on statistical methods to determine authenticity. It rejected the first defendant’s argument that the judge’s reliance on Mr. Radley’s approach was flawed, emphasizing that the judge correctly applied the "no-lose" argument: if a signature contains multiple rare features (e.g., unique pen strokes or rhythm), the probability of it being genuine is extremely low. The court also rejected the first defendant’s claim that the 2006 will was a "partial will" or codicil, noting that the attesting witnesses’ evidence contradicted this and that the document’s structure (e.g., the signature over a crease) was inconsistent with a genuine will.  

#### **D. The Role of the Attesting Witnesses**  
The court held that the attesting witnesses (Mr. Wong and Mr. Ng) were not reliable. Mr. Wong, a solicitor, testified that the 2006 will was a partial will, but the first defendant’s evidence suggested otherwise. The judge rejected the first defendant’s claim that the 2006 will was a forgery by the first defendant himself, citing the scientific evidence that the signature was written over a crease and that the document’s structure (e.g., the presence of a discarded draft) was inconsistent with a genuine will. The court also noted that the first defendant’s attempt to manipulate the witnesses’ testimony (e.g., by showing them the 2006 will after signing it) was a clear indication of his dishonesty.  

#### **E. The Court’s Dismissal of the First Defendant’s Relationship Argument**  
The first defendant argued that Nina Wang’s deep affection for him should be considered in determining the validity of the 2006 will. However, the court rejected this, stating that the first defendant’s marital status and the fact that he was only a "lover" (not a husband) meant that his relationship with Nina Wang could not be a basis for her intent. The court also noted that the first defendant’s claims about the relationship were "disingenuous" and that the judge was not morally offended by the relationship but was focused on the evidence.  

#### **F. The Legal Consequences of Dishonesty in Probate Litigation**  
The court’s decision to order costs on an indemnity basis for the plaintiff was based on the first defendant’s "egregious abuse of the court’s process." The judge found that the first defendant had knowingly produced a forged will to secure his own financial gain, which was a clear violation of the court’s role in probate matters. The court emphasized that such behavior warranted a punitive cost order, as it would be "scarcely imaginable" for the court to order costs on a proportional basis given the first defendant’s dishonesty.  

#### **G. The Use of Scientific Evidence in Probate Cases**  
The court’s reliance on scientific evidence (e.g., the signature over a crease, the discarded draft, and the analysis of the 2006 will’s structure) marked a departure from traditional probate methods. It held that scientific examination of the document’s physical characteristics (e.g., creases, paper folding) was admissible and critical in determining authenticity. The court also rejected the first defendant’s argument that the judge’s statistical analysis of handwriting was flawed, affirming that the judge’s evaluation of the rarity of features in the signature was valid and supported by expert testimony.  

#### **H. The Legal Standard for "Fundamental Differences" in Handwriting Analysis**  
The court clarified that "fundamental differences" in handwriting are those that are not explained by the known variations of the writer. It rejected the first defendant’s argument that the judge’s reliance on Mr. Radley’s analysis of the 2006 will’s signature was flawed, emphasizing that the judge correctly identified the "no-lose" argument (i.e., that a signature with multiple rare features is highly improbable to be genuine). The court also rejected the first defendant’s claim that the judge’s use of "rarity" as a term was inconsistent with the accepted definitions, noting that the judge’s approach was grounded in common sense and scientific reasoning.  

#### **I. The Legal Implications of the First Defendant’s Financial Transactions**  
The court examined the first defendant’s financial dealings with Nina Wang, including the $688 million transfers to a company linked to him. It held that these payments were not indicative of a genuine will but rather of the first defendant’s attempt to manipulate the situation for personal gain. The court rejected the first defendant’s argument that these payments were a "gift" to him, noting that the amount was far too large to be a mere gesture of affection.  

#### **J. The Role of the Court in Preventing Abuse of Process**  
The court’s decision to dismiss the appeal and uphold the lower court’s findings was based on the first defendant’s persistent dishonesty. The judge’s detailed analysis of the evidence, including the first defendant’s false testimony and the scientific examination of the document, was deemed sufficient to conclude that the 2006 will was a forgery. The court emphasized that the first defendant’s actions (e.g., producing a forged will, manipulating witnesses) constituted an "egregious abuse of the process of the court," warranting a strict cost order.

### 4. **Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case**  
This case is remarkable for several reasons, both legal and factual:  

#### **A. The Role of Fung Shui in Probate Litigation**  
The first defendant’s claim that Nina Wang sought his "fung shui" services to locate her husband Teddy Wang is a unique and controversial aspect of the case. The court acknowledged the first defendant’s role in performing fung shui rituals, including digging holes in Ap Lei Chau (where Teddy Wang’s car was found) and locating a temple for prayer, but concluded that these activities were not related to the 2006 will. The court’s detailed analysis of the first defendant’s involvement in fung shui, including the timing and purpose of the hole-digging, highlights the intersection of personal relationships, cultural practices, and legal scrutiny in probate cases.  

#### **B. The First Defendant’s "Clandestine" Relationship**  
The first defendant’s relationship with Nina Wang was kept secret for years, despite the fact that he was married and had children. The court noted that this relationship was "surreptitious and lacking in permanency," which was a key factor in dismissing the first defendant’s claims about the 2006 will. The judge’s observations about the first defendant’s marital status and the lack of permanence in the relationship were critical in determining the validity of the will.  

#### **C. The Use of Scientific Evidence to Examine the Will’s Physical Structure**  
The court’s reliance on scientific evidence to determine the authenticity of the 2006 will was groundbreaking. For example, the judge noted that the signature on the 2006 will was written over a crease in the paper, a detail that was only revealed through forensic analysis. This physical evidence was deemed more reliable than the attesting witnesses’ testimony, which was later contradicted. The court’s emphasis on the physical characteristics of the document (e.g., creases, paper folding) underscores the importance of scientific methods in probate cases.  

#### **D. The First Defendant’s Attempt to Manipulate the Court**  
The first defendant’s actions, including his false testimony about his education, his manipulation of the attesting witnesses, and his attempt to "blow the whistle" on the will’s authenticity by revealing it to the public, were deemed highly suspicious. The court’s decision to order costs on an indemnity basis was a direct response to this behavior, highlighting the legal consequences of dishonesty in probate proceedings.  

#### **E. The Court’s Rejection of the First Defendant’s "Love" Argument**  
The first defendant argued that Nina Wang’s affection for him should be considered in determining the validity of the 2006 will. However, the court rejected this, stating that the first defendant’s marital status and the lack of permanence in their relationship made his claims "disingenuous." This decision reflects a broader legal principle that the court must prioritize evidence over subjective claims of affection or personal relationships in will disputes.  

#### **F. The Length and Detail of the Judgment**  
The judgment is exceptionally long (over 44 pages) and detailed, with the court meticulously analyzing the evidence, including the attesting witnesses’ testimony, the handwriting analysis, and the financial transactions. This level of scrutiny is rare in probate cases and underscores the court’s commitment to ensuring the accuracy of its findings.  

#### **G. The First Defendant’s "Clandestine" Financial Transactions**  
The first defendant’s financial dealings with Nina Wang, including the $688 million transfers to a company he controlled, were not merely a matter of personal favoritism but a deliberate attempt to manipulate the will’s authenticity. The court’s rejection of the first defendant’s claim that these payments were "gifts" or "charitable donations" was based on the sheer scale of the transactions and their inconsistency with the first defendant’s role as a "lover."  

#### **H. The Court’s Use of the "No-Lose" Argument in Handwriting Analysis**  
The court’s application of the "no-lose" argument (i.e., that a signature with multiple rare features is highly improbable to be genuine) was a novel approach in probate law. This argument was based on statistical analysis and was accepted by the court despite the first defendant’s criticisms. The decision to reject the first defendant’s alternative interpretation of the evidence (e.g., that the signature was a "partial will") was grounded in the judge’s detailed evaluation of the document’s structure and the attesting witnesses’ testimony.  

#### **I. The First Defendant’s "Clandestine" Meeting with Nina Wang’s Relatives**  
The court noted that the first defendant arranged a meeting with Nina Wang’s relatives shortly after her death, where he revealed the 2006 will. This act of "blasting the will into the public eye" was seen as a deliberate attempt to manipulate the probate process, further supporting the court’s conclusion that the will was a forgery.  

#### **J. The Court’s Rejection of the First Defendant’s "Clandestine" Evidence**  
The first defendant attempted to introduce evidence of his relationship with Nina Wang, including a letter from a solicitor that suggested he had passed the 2006 will to the plaintiff’s counsel. However, the court rejected this evidence, noting that the first defendant’s claims were "disingenuous" and that the evidence did not support his case. This highlights the court’s skepticism of the first defendant’s attempts to use personal relationships as a basis for will authenticity.  

In summary, the case is remarkable for its detailed forensic analysis, the court’s rejection of the first defendant’s claims based on personal relationships, and the legal consequences of dishonesty in probate proceedings. The court’s approach to scientific evidence and the "no-lose" argument in handwriting analysis sets a precedent for the rigorous scrutiny of will authenticity in Hong Kong law. [end of text]
