### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts

The case involves a high-profile probate dispute concerning the estate of Nina Wang, a prominent Hong Kong businesswoman and philanthropist. After her death on April 3, 2007, her longtime partner, **Allen Ching (first defendant)**, produced a will dated **October 16, 2006** (the "2006 will") naming himself as the sole beneficiary. This will was contested by **Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd (the plaintiff)**, a charitable foundation established by Nina Wang and her late husband, Teddy Wang, which stood to inherit her entire estate under a valid will executed on **July 28, 2002** (the "2002 will").

Key facts:
- **Nina Wang** was the chairwoman of the Chinachem Group, a major private conglomerate in Hong Kong.
- She had been diagnosed with terminal cancer in 2004 and died in 2007.
- The **2002 will** was upheld in a prior case (Wang Din Shin v. Wang Ying Ming) as valid, leaving her estate to the plaintiff.
- **Allen Ching**, a self-proclaimed feng shui master, had a long-standing, secret relationship with Nina Wang, which began in 1992. He received substantial gifts from her (over HK$720 million between 1993–1997) but was married with children.
- The **2006 will** was allegedly signed in the presence of a solicitor, Mr. Winfield Wong, and Mr. Ng Shung Mo, but both witnesses later claimed they had witnessed a different document—a partial will leaving HK$10 million to a Mr. Chan, not the full estate to Ching.
- The plaintiff argued the 2006 will was a **forgery**, fabricated by Ching to inherit Nina Wang’s fortune.
- The trial judge, **Lam J**, found the 2006 will to be a **forgery**, rejecting Ching’s claims and ordering costs on an indemnity basis against him.

### 2. Summary of the Parties' Arguments

**Plaintiff (Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd):**
- Argued the 2006 will was a **forgery**, fabricated by Ching to claim Nina Wang’s estate.
- Presented evidence that Nina Wang had **no intention** of changing her 2002 will, which already named the plaintiff as sole beneficiary.
- Highlighted inconsistencies in Ching’s claims, including his false claims about his education and his secretive relationship with Nina Wang.
- Emphasized that Nina Wang had **continued her philanthropic work** and showed no signs of altering her will, even after her cancer diagnosis.
- Submitted that the **witnesses’ testimony** (Wong and Ng) proved the 2006 will was not the document they had seen.

**First Defendant (Allen Ching):**
- Claimed the 2006 will was **valid** and reflected Nina Wang’s true intentions.
- Asserted that he and Nina Wang had a **long-term intimate relationship**, and she had wanted to leave her estate to him.
- Argued that the 2002 will was a **publicity stunt** to gain support in litigation over Teddy Wang’s will.
- Denied being a feng shui master and claimed his relationship with Nina Wang was based on affection, not professional services.
- Contended that the **witnesses’ testimony was unreliable**, and the scientific handwriting analysis was flawed.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The Court of Appeal (Hong Kong) upheld the trial judge’s findings, confirming the **2006 will was a forgery**. The judgment provides a comprehensive analysis of **probate law, handwriting evidence, and the burden of proof**. Key legal principles include:

#### **A. Burden of Proof in Forgery Cases**
- The plaintiff must prove that the contested will is a **forgery** by **clear and convincing evidence**.
- The court must weigh **inherent improbabilities** (e.g., why a testator would change her will shortly before death) against the evidence.
- The judge’s findings on **inherent improbabilities** (paragraphs 841–876) were upheld as **properly considered**.

#### **B. Witness Testimony and Credibility**
- The judge **preferred the evidence of Mr. Wong and Mr. Ng**, finding their accounts **credible and consistent**.
- The court rejected Ching’s claims that the witnesses had **tailored their evidence** to favor the plaintiff, noting their **cross-examination** revealed no such bias.
- The judge emphasized that **witnesses are not required to recall every detail** but must testify **honestly and consistently**.

#### **C. Handwriting Analysis and Expert Evidence**
- The court **upheld the trial judge’s acceptance of handwriting expert Mr. Radley’s methodology**, despite challenges from the defendant.
- **Key principles from *Nina Kung v. Wang Din Shin*** were applied:
  - **Similarities alone are insufficient** if there are significant differences.
  - **Rarities (unusual features) are significant** when accumulated, as they indicate a **non-accidental pattern**.
  - The **"no-lose" argument** (where a large range of variation makes matches inevitable) was rejected as **misleading**.
- The court found the **Nina Wang signature** and **Winfield Wong’s signature** to be **simulations**, not genuine.

#### **D. Forgery as a Deliberate Act**
- The court found **Ching must have prepared the 2006 will**, as Nina Wang was **too ill** (bedridden, unable to climb stairs) to sign it herself.
- The **absence of the 2006 will at Chinachem premises** after her death, combined with the **witnesses’ testimony**, pointed to **fabrication**.
- The court rejected Ching’s claim that the 2002 will was a **"charade"** to secure litigation support, noting Nina Wang’s **consistent philanthropy** and **continued support for the plaintiff**.

#### **E. Costs Order**
- The court **upheld the indemnity costs order** against Ching, citing his **dishonest conduct** (forgery, perjury, and abuse of process).
- The judge’s **costs adjustment** (excluding two expert witnesses) was deemed **fair**, as Ching had forced the plaintiff to pursue unnecessary evidence.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

- **The Scale of the Estate**: The case involved an estimated **$100 billion** estate, making it one of the **largest probate disputes in Hong Kong history**.
