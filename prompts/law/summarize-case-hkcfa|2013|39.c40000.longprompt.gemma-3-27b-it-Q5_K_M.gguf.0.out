## W v. The Registrar of Marriages: Case Summary

### 1. Facts of the Case

W is a post-operative male-to-female transsexual person who has undergone full sex reassignment surgery (removal of male organs and construction of a vagina) and is legally recognized as female in Hong Kong, possessing a new identity card and passport reflecting this. She wishes to marry her male partner. The Registrar of Marriages refused to recognize her as a “woman” under the Marriage Ordinance and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance, effectively preventing the marriage. W brought a judicial review challenging this decision, arguing she should be legally considered a woman for marriage purposes. The case progressed through the Hong Kong courts, ultimately reaching the Court of Final Appeal. The core issue revolves around whether the existing legislation, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman, is compatible with the constitutional right to marry and the right to privacy when applied to a post-operative transsexual person.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**Appellant (W):**

*   **Statutory Interpretation:** The terms “man” and “woman” should be interpreted inclusively to encompass post-operative transsexuals, especially given medical advancements and societal changes.
*   **Constitutional Right to Marry:** The refusal to recognize her as a woman violates her right to marry under Article 37 of the Basic Law and Article 19(2) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights.  Denying her the right to marry a man effectively denies her the right to marry at all.
*   **Right to Privacy:** The denial infringes upon her right to privacy under Article 14 of the Bill of Rights.
*   **Evolving Standards:**  International trends and the decisions of courts in other jurisdictions (particularly the European Court of Human Rights in *Goodwin v UK*) demonstrate a growing acceptance of transsexual marriage, and Hong Kong law should evolve accordingly.

**Respondent (Registrar of Marriages):**

*   **Statutory Interpretation:** The legislation, when properly interpreted, clearly defines marriage as between a biological man and a biological woman. The historical and traditional understanding of marriage supports this interpretation.
*   **Constitutional Compatibility:** The legislation is compatible with the Basic Law and Bill of Rights because the right to marry is not absolute and can be limited to traditional definitions.
*   **Legislative Prerogative:** Any changes to the definition of marriage are a matter for the legislature, not the courts. The courts should not overstep their bounds and impose new social policies.
*   **Procreation as a Core Element:** While not a strict requirement, the ability to procreate is a fundamental aspect of traditional marriage, and a post-operative transsexual cannot fulfill this aspect.
