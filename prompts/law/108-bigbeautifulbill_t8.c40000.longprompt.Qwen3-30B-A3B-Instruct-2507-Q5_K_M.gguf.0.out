**Sec. 80001. Exemption of Certain Assets.**  
The Higher Education Act of 1965 is amended to exempt from financial need calculations the net value of a family farm where the family resides, a small business with up to 100 full-time or equivalent employees owned and controlled by the family, or a commercial fishing business and related expenses (including vessels and permits) owned and controlled by the family. These exemptions apply to award year 2026–2027 and later, effective July 1, 2026. The change expands asset exclusions beyond previously defined categories to include family-owned agricultural and fishing enterprises. The amendment applies to all students receiving federal financial aid under Title IV.

**Sec. 81001. Establishment of Loan Limits for Graduate and Professional Students and Parent Borrowers; Termination of Graduate and Professional PLUS Loans.**  
Effective July 1, 2026, graduate and professional students may no longer receive interest-subsidized Stafford loans, and the maximum annual unsubsidized Stafford loan limit is set at $20,500 for graduate students and $50,000 for professional students. Aggregate limits are $100,000 for non-professional graduate students and $200,000 for professional students, minus prior borrowing. Parent borrowers may borrow up to $20,000 annually and $65,000 total per dependent student. The Federal Direct PLUS Loan for graduate and professional students is terminated effective July 1, 2026, with a lifetime aggregate limit of $257,500 for all student loans (excluding parent PLUS loans).

**Sec. 82001. Loan Repayment.**  
Beginning July 1, 2028, borrowers with loans under income-contingent repayment (ICR) plans must transition to either the Repayment Assistance Plan under section 455(q) or the income-based repayment plan under section 493C. The ICR plan is repealed, and all loans made on or after July 1, 2026, must be repaid under a standard repayment plan (10–25 years based on balance) or the new Repayment Assistance Plan. Borrowers with "excepted loans" (e.g., parent PLUS or certain consolidation loans) must repay them under the standard plan only. The Repayment Assistance Plan caps monthly payments at 10% of adjusted gross income (with a $10 minimum), offers interest subsidies, and cancels balances after 360 qualifying payments.

**Sec. 82002. Deferment; Forbearance.**  
Effective July 1, 2027, borrowers with loans made on or after that date are no longer eligible for economic hardship or unemployment deferments. Forbearance is limited to 9 months per 24-month period for loans made on or after July 1, 2027. The change eliminates broad deferment access and restricts forbearance to prevent prolonged non-repayment. These provisions apply to all borrowers with loans originating after June 30, 2027.

**Sec. 82003. Loan Rehabilitation.**  
Borrowers may rehabilitate defaulted loans up to two times, effective July 1, 2027, for both FFEL and Direct loans, including Perkins loans. The minimum monthly payment for rehabilitation of loans made on or after July 1, 2027, is $10. The change increases flexibility for borrowers to recover from default but maintains a floor on repayment amounts. The amendment applies to all Title IV loans.

**Sec. 82004. Public Service Loan Forgiveness.**  
Eligibility for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) now includes on-time payments made under the new Repayment Assistance Plan under section 455(q). The change expands qualifying payment types to include those under the new income-based plan. Previously, only payments under ICR or standard plans counted toward PSLF. This update ensures that borrowers in the Repayment Assistance Plan can still qualify for forgiveness after 120 qualifying payments.

**Sec. 82005. Student Loan Servicing.**  
An additional $1 billion is appropriated for student loan servicing administrative costs under Title IV, to be available until expended. The funds are in addition to existing appropriations and are dedicated to servicing the Direct Loan Program. The appropriation applies to the Secretary of Education and supports operations related to loan servicing. The amount is not subject to annual appropriation.

**Sec. 83001. Eligibility.**  
For Pell Grant eligibility beginning July 1, 2026, adjusted gross income (AGI) includes foreign income of parents (for dependent students) and students (for independent students). The change expands AGI to include foreign earnings, affecting eligibility determinations. A student with a student aid index equal to or exceeding twice the maximum Pell Grant amount is ineligible for a Pell Grant. The rule takes effect July 1, 2026.

**Sec. 83002. Workforce Pell Grants.**  
Starting July 1, 2026, the Secretary will award Workforce Pell Grants to students enrolled in eligible workforce programs (150–600 clock hours, 8–15 weeks, not correspondence-based). Programs must be approved by the State Governor and the Secretary, with requirements including 70% completion and job placement rates, and tuition not exceeding value-added earnings. Students cannot receive both a Workforce Pell Grant and a standard Pell Grant or a grant under section 401(c). The program is limited to non-degree, short-term workforce training.

**Sec. 83003. Pell Shortfall.**  
The Pell Grant shortfall appropriation is increased from $2.17 billion to $12.67 billion annually. The change ensures sufficient funding to cover the full cost of Pell Grants under the expanded program. The increase applies to award year 2026–2027 and beyond. The funding is intended to prevent cuts to Pell Grant awards due to budget shortfalls.

**Sec. 83004. Federal Pell Grant Exclusion Relating to Other Grant Aid.**  
Beginning July 1, 2026, a student receiving non-Federal grant aid (from states, institutions, or private sources) equal to or exceeding their cost of attendance is ineligible for a Federal Pell Grant during that period. The rule prevents double benefits from federal and non-federal aid. The exclusion applies to all award years starting July 1, 2026. It is enforced by the Secretary of Education.

**Sec. 84001. Ineligibility Based on Low Earning Outcomes.**  
Institutions may not use Title IV funds for enrollment in educational programs where the median earnings of graduates (4 years prior to determination) are below the median earnings of comparable working adults for 2 of the last 3 years. The Secretary uses Bureau of the Census data, with state or national benchmarks depending on program type. Programs with fewer than 30 graduates must aggregate data across years to meet cohort size. Institutions may appeal and regain eligibility after 2 years of ineligibility.

**Sec. 85001. Delay of Rule Relating to Borrower Defense to Repayment.**  
For loans originating before July 1, 2035, the borrower defense to repayment rule (from 2022 regulations) is delayed and not in effect. The prior rule from July 1, 2020, is restored and revived. The delay applies to all loans made before July 1, 2035, and prevents enforcement of the 2022 rule. The Department of Education must revert to the 2020 regulatory framework for these loans.

**Sec. 85002. Delay of Rule Relating to Closed School Discharges.**  
For loans originating before July 1, 2035, the 2022 closed school discharge rules (sections 674.33(g), 682.402(d), 685.214 of title 34 CFR) are not in effect. The prior versions of these rules, as in effect on July 1, 2020, are restored. The delay applies to all loans made before July 1, 2035. The Department of Education must use the pre-2022 discharge standards for closed school cases.

**Sec. 86001. Garden of Heroes.**  
$40 million is appropriated to the National Endowment for the Humanities for fiscal year 2025, to remain available through fiscal year 2028, for statues in the National Garden of American Heroes. The funds are for procurement under Executive Orders 13934, 13978, and 14189. The appropriation is in addition to existing funds and supports monument construction. The project is part of a national initiative to honor American heroes.

**Sec. 87001. Potential Sponsor Vetting for Unaccompanied Alien Children Appropriation.**  
$300 million is appropriated to the Office of Refugee Resettlement for fiscal year 2025, to remain available until September 30, 2028, for vetting potential sponsors of unaccompanied alien children. Funds cover background checks (including fingerprints, sex offender registry, criminal history), home studies, interviews, and data systems for safety and trafficking prevention. The funds may only be used for vetting and placement of unaccompanied alien children. The appropriation applies to all potential sponsors and their household members. [end of text]
