The funding applies specifically to the U.S. border, with no specified geographic limitations within the Southwest, Northern, or maritime borders. All expenditures must align with CBP’s operational needs and are subject to federal oversight.

**Sec. 90002. U.S. Customs and Border Protection Personnel, Fleet Vehicles, and Facilities.**  
$4.1 billion is allocated for hiring and training CBP personnel—including Border Patrol agents, Office of Field Operations officers, Air and Marine agents, and field support staff—available until September 30, 2029. An additional $2.05 billion is designated for retention, recruitment, and performance bonuses for eligible CBP agents and officers. $855 million is set aside for repairing existing patrol units and leasing or acquiring new fleet vehicles. $5 billion is provided for CBP facility leases, acquisitions, construction, design, or improvements, with a restriction preventing use of funds after October 31, 2028, for processing coordinators.

$45 billion is appropriated to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for fiscal year 2025, available until September 30, 2029, to expand single adult alien detention and family residential center capacity. Family residential centers are defined as facilities detaining family units, including children not classified as unaccompanied alien children under the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Detention may continue until removal decisions are made or aliens are removed, per the Immigration and Nationality Act. The Secretary of Homeland Security retains discretion over detention standards for adult facilities.

$6.168 billion is appropriated to CBP for fiscal year 2025, available until September 30, 2029, for nonintrusive inspection equipment, AI and machine learning integration, and border surveillance upgrades. Funds support air and marine platform procurement, biometric entry/exit system deployment, screening of persons entering/exiting the U.S., and initial screening of unaccompanied alien children. The bill prohibits use of funds for surveillance towers along the Southwest or Northern borders unless they have been tested and accepted by CBP for autonomous capabilities. Autonomous systems are defined as those using AI, machine learning, or computer vision to detect, classify, and track items in real time without continuous human control.

**Sec. 90005. State and Local Assistance.**  
$500 million is allocated for State and local capabilities to detect, identify, and monitor unmanned aircraft systems under the State Homeland Security Grant Program. $625 million is designated for security costs related to the 2026 FIFA World Cup, and $1 billion for the 2028 Olympics, both exempt from certain Homeland Security Act requirements. $450 million is provided for the Operation Stonegarden Grant Program. A new $10 billion State Border Security Reinforcement Fund is established within DHS to fund state and local border wall construction, barrier installation, ground preparation, detection of illegal aliens, and relocation of unlawfully present individuals, available until September 30, 2034.

**Sec. 90006. Presidential Residence Protection.**  
$300 million is appropriated to FEMA for fiscal year 2025, available until September 30, 2029, to reimburse state and local agencies for extraordinary law enforcement costs tied to protecting presidential residences designated under the Presidential Protection Assistance Act of 1976. Reimbursements apply only to costs incurred on or after July 1, 2024, that exceed typical operations and are directly attributable to Secret Service-requested protection at nongovernmental properties. Agencies must certify costs and demonstrate direct linkage to Secret Service protection needs. FEMA may use up to 3% of funds for administrative purposes.

**Sec. 90007. Department of Homeland Security Appropriations for Border Support.**  
$10 billion is appropriated to the Secretary of Homeland Security for fiscal year 2025, available until September 30, 2029, to reimburse federal, state, and local entities for costs incurred in supporting DHS’s border security mission. Funds are intended for activities directly related to safeguarding U.S. borders, including interdiction, surveillance, and coordination with federal and non-federal partners. The appropriation is not limited to specific programs but applies broadly to mission-critical border operations. No specific reporting requirements are detailed, but funds are subject to standard federal accountability rules.

**Sec. 90101. FEHB Improvements.**  
The FEHB Protection Act of 2025 mandates the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Director to implement verification processes within one year of enactment to confirm the legitimacy of qualifying life events and eligibility of family members added to health benefits plans. OPM must conduct a three-year audit of family members covered under FEHB, reviewing marriage and birth certificates to verify eligibility. The Director must develop a disenrollment process within 180 days to remove ineligible individuals from plans. $66 million is appropriated in fiscal year 2026 for OPM to carry out these provisions, available until the end of fiscal year 2035.

**Sec. 90102. Pandemic Response Accountability Committee.**  
$88 million is appropriated for fiscal year 2026 to the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC) to oversee spending related to the Coronavirus pandemic, including funds from this Act and prior legislation. The CARES Act is amended to extend PRAC’s authority through 2034, replacing the prior 2025 deadline. The amendment adds this Act as a covered funding source under PRAC’s oversight jurisdiction. PRAC may now audit all pandemic-related expenditures, including those from this reconciliation bill.

**Sec. 90103. Appropriation for the Office of Management and Budget.**  
$100 million is appropriated to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for fiscal year 2025, available until September 30, 2029, to identify budget and accounting efficiencies across the executive branch. The funds are intended to support OMB’s internal operations and strategic planning for federal financial management. No specific projects or programs are detailed, but the appropriation enables OMB to conduct audits, streamline processes, and improve interagency coordination. The funds are not subject to annual congressional caps, as specified in the amendment to Section 8909 of Title 5. [end of text]
