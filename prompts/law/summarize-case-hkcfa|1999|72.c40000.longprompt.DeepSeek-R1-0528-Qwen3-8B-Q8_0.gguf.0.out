Okay, the user has provided a detailed legal case and asked for a summary of four specific tasks. Let me start by understanding what each task entails. 

First, they want a brief summary of the facts. The case involves three appellants challenging their right of abode in Hong Kong under the Basic Law. The Director of Immigration denied their claims based on a scheme requiring specific permits. The Court of Final Appeal had to interpret the Basic Law and determine the constitutionality of the scheme.

Next, summarizing the arguments of both parties. The applicants argue that the Basic Law grants them the right of abode without conditions, while the Director claims that Article 22(4) requires entry approval, thus limiting their rights. The Director also emphasized the need for Mainland approval, which the applicants contested.

Then, detailing the legal principles, especially novel or controversial points. The key here is the Court's jurisdiction to interpret the Basic Law, severability of provisions, and the application of international human rights law. The Court ruled that they could interpret non-excluded provisions without seeking Standing Committee approval, which was a significant departure from the previous Court of Appeal's stance. Also, the birth out of wedlock issue was addressed, ensuring equal treatment under the law.

Finally, identifying anything striking or remarkable. The case is notable for the Court of Final Appeal's assertion of jurisdiction over the National People's Congress, which was a major shift in Hong Kong's constitutional interpretation. The severance of parts of the Immigration Ordinance and the emphasis on human rights principles are also remarkable.

Now, the user might be a law student or researcher looking for a concise breakdown of this case. They need to understand the key points quickly, possibly for an exam or paper. The depth of the legal principles suggests they're interested in the constitutional and human rights aspects. The final question about striking elements indicates they might be analyzing the case's significance beyond the legal arguments.

I should ensure that the summary is clear and covers all parts without getting too verbose. Highlighting the novel points like the Court's jurisdiction and the severance principle will address the user's deeper need to grasp the case's impact on Hong Kong's legal system. Mentioning the human rights angle shows the user the broader implications, which they might not have explicitly asked for but is relevant to the case's outcome.

### 1. Summary of Facts

The case *Ng Ka Ling and Another v. The Director of Immigration* [1999] HKCFA 72 concerns the interpretation of Hong Kong's Basic Law regarding the right of abode for permanent residents. Three appellants challenged the Director of Immigration's refusal to recognize their right of abode under Article 24(3) of the Basic Law, which grants the right to permanent residents. The appellants included two sisters born on the mainland with a father who had ordinarily resided in Hong Kong for seven years, and a third applicant born out of wedlock with the same father. The Director argued that their right of abode was subject to a scheme requiring them to hold a "one-way permit" issued by the Mainland authorities, which they did not possess. The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) had to determine whether this scheme was constitutional and whether the retrospective application of the Immigration (Amendment) (No 3) Ordinance was valid. The case also addressed the issue of whether the definition of parent-child relationships in the Immigration Ordinance excluded children born out of wedlock from inheriting permanent resident status.

### 2. Summary of Arguments

**Appellants' Arguments:**  
The appellants argued that the Basic Law grants them the right of abode without conditions, and that the scheme introduced by the Immigration (Amendment) (No 3) Ordinance, which required a "one-way permit" from the Mainland, was unconstitutional. They also contended that the definition of parent-child relationships in the Immigration Ordinance, which required legitimation for children born out of wedlock, violated the principle of equality enshrined in the Basic Law and the ICCPR.  

**Director's Arguments:**  
The Director argued that Article 22(4) of the Basic Law requires all individuals from the Mainland seeking entry into Hong Kong to obtain approval, thereby limiting the right of abode granted by Article 24(3). He also claimed that the scheme requiring the "one-way permit" was necessary to implement the Basic Law and that the retrospective application of the No 3 Ordinance was valid.  

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**Constitutional Jurisdiction of the Courts:**  
The CFA ruled that it had the authority to interpret the Basic Law independently, without seeking an interpretation from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC), unless the interpretation involved "excluded provisions" (Article 158(3)). This was a significant departure from the Court of Appeal's earlier stance in *HKSAR v Ma Wai Kwan David*, which had limited the jurisdiction of Hong Kong courts to query the validity of acts by the NPC or its delegates. The CFA emphasized that the Basic Law is a "living instrument" and that the courts must adopt a purposive approach to interpretation, considering the context and principles of the Basic Law and relevant international covenants.

**Constitutionality of the No 3 Ordinance:**  
The CFA declared that the No 3 Ordinance, which introduced the scheme requiring a "one-way permit" for the right of abode, was unconstitutional to the extent that it required permanent residents to hold such a permit. The court reasoned that Article 22(4) of the Basic Law did not apply to permanent residents, as they were not "people from other parts of China" in the same sense as ordinary Mainland citizens. The scheme was severable, meaning that the unconstitutional parts could be removed while leaving the rest intact.

**Retrospectivity Issue:**  
The retrospective application of the No 3 Ordinance, which came into effect on 1 July 1997, was declared unconstitutional. The court relied on Article 15(1) of the ICCPR, which prohibits holding someone guilty of a criminal offense retrospectively. The appellants, who had already exercised their right of abode before the scheme was implemented, could not be penalized for doing so.

**Birth Out of Wedlock Issue:**  
The CFA invalidated the part of the Immigration Ordinance that excluded children born out of wedlock from inheriting permanent resident status, except where legitimated by subsequent marriage. The court emphasized the principle of equality, stating that such discrimination was contrary to the Basic Law and the ICCPR.

**Purposive Interpretation:**  
The case highlighted the importance of purposive interpretation in constitutional law. The court considered the purpose of the Basic Law, which is to establish Hong Kong as an inalienable part of China under the "one country, two systems" principle, and used this to resolve ambiguities in the provisions.

### 4. Striking, Unusual or Remarkable Aspects

The case is remarkable for the Court of Final Appeal's assertion of its jurisdiction to interpret the Basic Law independently, without deference to the NPCSC, unless the interpretation concerns excluded provisions. This was a significant shift in Hong Kong's constitutional jurisprudence, as it established the CFA as the ultimate interpreter of the Basic Law. Additionally, the court's decision to sever parts of the Immigration Ordinance while upholding the rest demonstrated a nuanced approach to constitutional interpretation, ensuring that the scheme's validity was not entirely invalidated. The case also underscored the importance of human rights principles, particularly the ICCPR, in shaping Hong Kong's legal framework post-handover. The ruling reinforced the protection of fundamental rights, such as the right to vote and the right to abode, which are essential to Hong Kong's identity as a separate system within China.
