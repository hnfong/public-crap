Got it, let's tackle this case step by step. First, I need to remember the user's tasks: summarize facts, parties' arguments, legal principles (ratio), and anything striking. Let's start with facts because that's the foundation.

**Facts**: The case involves four applicants (Ng Ka Ling, Ng Tan Tan, Tsui Kuen Nang, Cheung Lai Wah) who are Chinese nationals born in mainland China. Their fathers were Hong Kong permanent residents (having lived there ≥7 years before their births). They claimed right of abode under Article 24(2)(3) of the Basic Law (permanent residents: persons of Chinese nationality born outside HK of residents in categories 1 or 2). The Director of Immigration (DOI) denied their right, citing the Immigration (Amendment) (No 3) Ordinance 1997 ("No 3 Ordinance"), which required them to hold a "one-way permit" (Mainland exit approval) affixed with a "certificate of entitlement" to establish right of abode. The applicants challenged this via judicial review, arguing the No 3 Ordinance violated their constitutional right of abode under the Basic Law. Cheung also faced an additional issue: she was born out of wedlock, and the DOI argued her father-child relationship wasn't recognized under the Immigration Ordinance's Schedule 1 para 1(2)(b), which only recognized fathers if the child was legitimated by subsequent marriage.

**Parties' Arguments**: 
- **Applicants**: They are permanent residents under Article 24(2)(3), so they have an unconditional right of abode under Article 24(3). The No 3 Ordinance is unconstitutional because it requires a Mainland-issued one-way permit (contrary to Article 24's guarantee) and imposes retroactive criminal liability (violating ICCPR Article 15). For Cheung, the out-of-wedlock discrimination violates equality (Basic Law Art 25, ICCPR Arts 3,26) and the plain meaning of Article 24(2)(3), which doesn't distinguish between wedlock status.
- **DOI**: The No 3 Ordinance is constitutional because Article 22(4) of the Basic Law requires Central Government approval for entry from mainland China, so the one-way permit is a valid restriction. The retroactive provision is valid because it doesn't criminalize past acts (only affects future status). For Cheung, the Immigration Ordinance's para 1(2)(b) is a legitimate interpretation of Article 24(2)(3), supported by a JLG agreement, and doesn't violate equality since it's based on immigration policy.

**Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**: Let's break this down by the key issues the Court addressed:

1. **Constitutional Jurisdiction of Hong Kong Courts**: The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) clarified that Hong Kong courts have the power to review acts of the National People's Congress (NPC) and its Standing Committee (NPCSC) for consistency with the Basic Law. This rejected the earlier Court of Appeal decision in *Ma Wai Kwan* that colonial-era restrictions on challenging UK legislation applied to NPC acts. The CFA held that under the Basic Law, courts must enforce constitutional rights, including reviewing central government acts if they conflict with the Basic Law.

2. **Interpretation of the Basic Law: Purposive Approach**: The CFA emphasized a **purposive approach** to interpreting the Basic Law, especially Chapter III (Fundamental Rights), which guarantees rights like right of abode. For provisions defining permanent residents (e.g., Art 24(2)(3)), the Court must consider the context (including the "one country, two systems" principle) and extrinsic materials (like the Joint Declaration) to give effect to the Basic Law's purpose: protecting Hong Kong's high autonomy and residents' rights.

3. **Right of Abode Under Article 24(3) is Unconditional**: The core holding: Article 24(3) confers an **unqualified right of abode** on permanent residents (including those in Art 24(2)(3)). This right includes the right to land and remain, which cannot be restricted by Article 22(4) (which governs entry for non-permanent mainland residents). The Court held that permanent residents are not "people from other parts of China" under Art 22(4); they are already part of Hong Kong's resident class, so Art 22(4) does not apply to them. Thus, the No 3 Ordinance's requirement of a Mainland one-way permit (a condition on entry for non-permanents) was unconstitutional as applied to permanent residents.

4. **Severability of Unconstitutional Legislation**: The CFA applied a severability test: if unconstitutional parts can be removed without invalidating the rest, they are excised. The No 3 Ordinance was mostly saved except for: (a) the requirement of a one-way permit (replaced with just a certificate of entitlement); (b) the retroactive provision (deemed invalid under ICCPR Art 15(1), which prohibits ex post facto criminal laws); (c) the clause in the certificate of entitlement that it's only valid if affixed to a travel document.

5. **Non-Discrimination and Equality**: For Cheung's out-of-wedlock status, the Court held that Schedule 1 para 1(2)(b) of the Immigration Ordinance was unconstitutional. The Basic Law Art 25 (equality before law) and ICCPR Arts 3 (prohibition of discrimination) and 26 (right to family life) require equal treatment of legitimate and illegitimate children. The plain meaning of Art 24(2)(3) ("born of those residents") includes children born out of wedlock, as biological parentage doesn't depend on wedlock. The JLG agreement relied on by the DOI was not a valid interpretation (under the Vienna Convention on Treaties) because it contradicted the clear purpose of Art 24 to protect family unity.

6. **Retroactive Laws and ICCPR Compliance**: The CFA held that the No 3 Ordinance's retroactive provision (deemed effective 1 July 1997) was unconstitutional under ICCPR Art 15(1), which applies to Hong Kong via Basic Law Art 39. The provision would have criminalized pre-10 July 1997 arrivals (like the Ng sisters) for staying without a certificate, which wasn't required before. The Court rejected the DOI's argument that Art 15 only prohibits prosecution—instead, in Hong Kong's legal system, a retroactive law that deprives existing rights (like right of abode) violates the ICCPR's core guarantee against ex post facto laws.

7. **Legality of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC)**: The CFA upheld the PLC's legality. Although the Basic Law didn't explicitly create the PLC, it was established by the NPC's 1990 Decision to fill a legislative vacuum when the "through train" (continuing the pre-1997 Legislative Council) failed. The PLC acted as an interim body with limited powers, consistent with the "one country, two systems" principle and the Basic Law's goal of smooth transition. Thus, laws enacted by the PLC (like the No 3 Ordinance) were valid, except for unconstitutional parts.

**Striking/Unusual Aspects**:
- **Constitutional Moment**: This was one of the first major cases interpreting the Basic Law by the CFA, establishing critical principles for Hong Kong's post-1997 constitutional jurisprudence (e.g., court power to review central government acts, purposive interpretation of rights).
- **Balance of "One Country" and "Two Systems"**: The Court had to navigate the tension between mainland immigration control (Art 22(4)) and Hong Kong's autonomous right to grant permanent residency (Art 24). Its holding that Art 22(4) doesn't apply to permanent residents was a key safeguard for Hong Kong's autonomy.
- **Retroactivity and Human Rights**: The Court's strong reliance on the ICCPR to strike down retroactive legislation was notable, as it linked international human rights law to Hong Kong's domestic constitutional framework.
- **Gender Equality in Family Law**: The ruling on Cheung's out-of-wedlock status was progressive, rejecting discrimination against illegitimate children and fathers, which aligned with modern human rights standards but clashed with earlier restrictive immigration policies.
- **Severability Doctrine**: The detailed severability analysis (excising specific clauses rather than invalidating the entire ordinance) showed the Court's willingness to save legislation where possible, avoiding overreach while protecting rights.

I need to make sure each section is clear, especially distinguishing between the facts, arguments, and legal principles. The ratio is the binding legal principles, so focusing on the Court's holdings on jurisdiction, interpretation, right of abode, severability, non-discrimination, retroactivity, and PLC legality is key.</seed:think>### 1. Brief Summary of Facts  
The case involves four applicants—**Ng Ka Ling, Ng Tan Tan, Tsui Kuen Nang, and Cheung Lai Wah**—all Chinese nationals born in mainland China. Their fathers were Hong Kong permanent residents (having resided in Hong Kong for ≥7 years before the applicants’ births), entitling them to claim right of abode under **Article 24(2)(3)** of the *Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region* (Basic Law), which defines permanent residents as "persons of Chinese nationality born outside Hong Kong of those residents listed in categories (1) and (2)" (e.g., those with ≥7 years’ residence).  

The **Director of Immigration (DOI)** denied their right of abode, relying on the *Immigration (Amendment) (No 3) Ordinance 1997* (No 3 Ordinance). This ordinance required permanent residents by descent to hold a **Mainland-issued "one-way permit"** (exit approval) affixed with a "certificate of entitlement" to establish their right of abode. The applicants argued this violated their constitutional right of abode. Cheung added a unique claim: she was born out of wedlock, and the DOI contended her father-child relationship was not recognized under the Immigration Ordinance’s Schedule 1 para 1(2)(b), which only acknowledged fathers if the child was later legitimated by the parents’ marriage.  


### 2. Arguments of the Parties  
#### **Applicants**  
- **Right of Abode Under Basic Law**: They are permanent residents under Article 24(2)(3), so Article 24(3) grants them an **unconditional right of abode** (including the right to land and remain). The No 3 Ordinance’s one-way permit requirement is unconstitutional because it imposes a mainland immigration control (Article 22(4)) on a right guaranteed by Hong Kong’s constitution.  
- **Retroactive Unconstitutionality**: The No 3 Ordinance’s retroactive provision (deemed effective 1 July 1997) violated **ICCPR Article 15(1)** (prohibiting ex post facto criminal laws) by criminalizing pre-10 July 1997 arrivals (like the Ng sisters) for staying without a certificate.  
- **Non-Discrimination for Cheung**: The Immigration Ordinance’s para 1(2)(b) discriminates against illegitimate children and fathers, violating **Basic Law Article 25** (equality) and **ICCPR Articles 3, 26** (non-discrimination and family rights). The plain meaning of Article 24(2)(3) includes children born out of wedlock, as biological parentage does not depend on wedlock.  

#### **DOI**  
- **Legality of No 3 Ordinance**: Article 22(4) of the Basic Law requires central government approval for mainland residents entering Hong Kong, so the one-way permit is a valid restriction on "people from other parts of China" (including the applicants).  
- **Retroactive Provision**: It does not criminalize past acts—only affects future status.  
- **Cheung’s Out-of-Wedlock Status**: The Immigration Ordinance’s para 1(2)(b) is a legitimate interpretation of Article 24(2)(3), supported by a Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) agreement, and reflects pragmatic immigration policy, not discrimination.  


### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) issued landmark rulings on Hong Kong’s constitutional framework, interpretation of the Basic Law, and human rights. Key principles include:  

#### **a. Constitutional Jurisdiction of Hong Kong Courts**  
The CFA rejected the earlier *Ma Wai Kwan* decision, holding that Hong Kong courts **may review acts of the National People’s Congress (NPC) and its Standing Committee (NPCSC)** for consistency with the Basic Law. This is a core duty to enforce constitutional rights, derived from the Basic Law’s grant of independent judicial power (Article 19) and the "one country, two systems" principle. Courts must act as a check on executive/legislative branches to ensure compliance with the Basic Law.  

#### **b. Purposive Interpretation of the Basic Law**  
The Basic Law must be interpreted **purposively**, especially Chapter III (Fundamental Rights), to give effect to its goals: protecting Hong Kong’s high autonomy and residents’ rights. For provisions like Article 24 (permanent residents), context (e.g., the Joint Declaration) and extrinsic materials (e.g., ICCPR) are critical. The Court emphasized that rights in Chapter III (e.g., right of abode) should be interpreted generously to ensure their practical effect.  

#### **c. Unqualified Right of Abode Under Article 24(3)**  
The core holding: **Article 24(3) confers an unconditional right of abode on permanent residents**, including those in Article 24(2)(3). This right includes the right to land and remain, which cannot be restricted by Article 22(4)—a provision governing entry for *non-permanent* mainland residents. The Court reasoned:  
  - Permanent residents are not "people from other parts of China" under Article 22(4); they are integral to Hong Kong’s resident class.  
  - Article 22(4) applies only to mainland residents without a right of abode, not to those already guaranteed it by the Basic Law.  

Thus, the No 3 Ordinance’s requirement of a Mainland one-way permit was **unconstitutional as applied to permanent residents**.  

#### **d. Severability of Unconstitutional Legislation**  
The CFA applied a severability test: if unconstitutional parts can be removed without invalidating the rest, they are excised. The No 3 Ordinance was saved *except* for:  
  - The one-way permit requirement (replaced with a standalone "certificate of entitlement").  
  - The retroactive provision (deemed invalid under ICCPR Article 15(1), which prohibits ex post facto laws).  
  - The clause in the certificate of entitlement stating it is only valid if affixed to a travel document.  

This approach balanced legislative validity with constitutional rights.  

#### **e. Non-Discrimination and Equality**  
For Cheung’s claim, the Court held **Schedule 1 para 1(2)(b) of the Immigration Ordinance is unconstitutional** because it discriminates against illegitimate children and fathers, violating:  
  - **Basic Law Article 25** (equality before the law).  
  - **ICCPR Articles 3** (prohibition of discrimination) and **26** (right to family life).  

The plain meaning of Article 24(2)(3)—"born of those residents"—includes children born out of wedlock, as biological parentage does not depend on marital status. The JLG agreement relied on by the DOI was irrelevant: under the *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties*, subsequent agreements do not override the clear purpose of a treaty (here, protecting family unity).  

#### **f. Retroactive Laws and ICCPR Compliance**  
The No 3 Ordinance’s retroactive provision (effective 1 July 1997) was struck down under **ICCPR Article 15(1)**, which applies to Hong Kong via Basic Law Article 39. The Court rejected the DOI’s argument that Article 15 only prohibits prosecution—instead, in Hong Kong’s legal system, a retroactive law that deprives existing rights (like right of abode) violates the ICCPR’s core guarantee against ex post facto laws. Pre-10 July 1997 arrivals could not have complied with the new requirement, so the provision was unjust.  

#### **g. Legality of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC)**  
The CFA upheld the PLC’s validity. Although the Basic Law did not explicitly create the PLC, it was established by the NPC’s 1990 Decision to fill a legislative vacuum when the "through train" (continuing the pre-1997 Legislative Council) failed. The PLC acted as an interim body with limited powers, consistent with the "one country, two systems" principle and the Basic Law’s goal of a smooth transition. Thus, laws enacted by the PLC (like the No 3 Ordinance) were valid—*except* for unconstitutional parts.  


### 4. Striking/Unusual Aspects  
- **Constitutional Founding Case**: One of the first major CFA rulings on the Basic Law, establishing foundational principles for Hong Kong’s post-1997 governance (e.g., court power to review central government acts, purposive rights interpretation).  
- **"One Country, Two Systems" Balance**: The Court navigated the tension between mainland immigration control (Article 22(4)) and Hong Kong’s autonomous right to grant permanent residency (Article 24), prioritizing Hong Kong’s autonomy while respecting national sovereignty.  
- **Progressive Family Rights**: The ruling on Cheung’s out-of-wedlock status was groundbreaking, rejecting gender and marital status discrimination in immigration law—aligning with modern human rights standards but clashing with earlier restrictive policies.  
- **Retroactivity and Human Rights**: The CFA’s reliance on the ICCPR to strike down retroactive legislation was notable, linking international human rights law to Hong Kong’s domestic constitution and setting a precedent for protecting vulnerable groups.  
- **Severability as a Tool**: The detailed severability analysis (excising specific clauses instead of invalidating the entire ordinance) demonstrated the Court’s pragmatic approach to preserving legislation while upholding rights, avoiding unnecessary disruption to governance. [end of text]
