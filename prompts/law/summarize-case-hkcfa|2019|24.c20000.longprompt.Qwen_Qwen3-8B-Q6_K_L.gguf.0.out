### 1. **Summary of the Facts**

The case involves **Donald Tsang Yam-kuen**, who served as the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and President of the Executive Council (ExCo). He was charged with **bribery** and **misconduct in public office** related to his dealings with **Wong Cho-bau**, a mainland businessman, concerning the **refurbishment and re-decoration of a residential property** in Shenzhen. The property was owned by a company controlled by Wong. Tsang intended to occupy the property after his retirement in mid-2012, and the proposed rental was at market rate. The prosecution alleged that the arrangements constituted a bribe, as they were an inducement or reward for Tsang’s handling of broadcasting licence applications made by **Wave Media Limited (WML)**, later renamed **Digital Broadcasting Corporation Hong Kong Limited (DBC)**, a company in which Wong held shares.

The case went through a trial before **Andrew Chan J** and a jury. The jury could not agree on the **bribery charge**, but Tsang was **convicted of misconduct in public office** and sentenced to **20 months’ imprisonment**. The **Court of Appeal** dismissed his appeal against conviction but reduced the sentence to **12 months**. Tsang then appealed to the **Court of Final Appeal (CFA)**, arguing that the trial judge had failed to properly direct the jury on the **elements of the misconduct charge**, particularly the **mental element of wilful misconduct** and the **seriousness of the conduct**.

The **third charge**, involving a recommendation of an interior designer, was **acquitted**. The **jury’s failure to agree** on the bribery charge raised questions about whether the **misconduct charge** was properly considered as an **alternative** to the bribery charge, rather than being tied to it.

### 2. **Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties**

**Prosecution’s Argument:**
- The **primary case** was that Tsang’s dealings with Wong constituted **bribery**, as the refurbishment of the property was an **inducement or reward** for his handling of broadcasting licence applications.
- The **misconduct charge** was based on Tsang’s **failure to disclose** or **conceal** his dealings with Wong, which created a **conflict of interest**.
- The prosecution argued that the **concealment** was **deliberate** and **dishonest**, and that the **non-disclosure** was **wilful** and **serious** enough to constitute misconduct in public office.
- The prosecution emphasized that the **non-disclosure** was part of a **corrupt scheme**, and that the **jury should have considered the two charges separately**.

**Defence’s Argument:**
- The **dealings** with Wong were **arm’s-length** and **commercial**, with no **improper benefit** to Tsang.
- The **refurbishment** and **rental** were at **market rate**, and the **property was not connected** to the broadcasting applications.
- The **non-disclosure** was not **wilful misconduct**, but rather a **mistake** or **error of judgment**, and did not meet the **threshold of seriousness** required for criminal liability.
- The **trial judge** failed to properly explain the **alternative scenario** where the **bribery charge** was not accepted, and the **misconduct charge** was considered independently.
- The **defence** argued that the **jury was not adequately directed** on the **elements of wilfulness** and **seriousness**, and that the **directions were insufficient** to allow the jury to properly assess the **alternative case**.

### 3. **Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) of the Case**

The **Court of Final Appeal (CFA)** held that the **trial judge’s directions on the elements of the misconduct charge were inadequate**, particularly in relation to the **mental element of wilfulness** and the **seriousness of the conduct**. The CFA emphasized that the **misconduct charge** was not necessarily tied to the **bribery charge**, and that the **jury should have been directed to consider the two charges separately**, even if the bribery charge was not accepted.

#### **A. The Elements of Misconduct in Public Office**

The CFA outlined the **elements of the common law offence of misconduct in public office** as follows:

1. **A public official** must have **wilfully misconducted himself** in the course of or in relation to his public office.
2. The **misconduct** must be **without reasonable excuse or justification**.
3. The **misconduct must be serious**, not trivial, in light of the **responsibilities of the office**, the **importance of the public objects** it serves, and the **nature and extent of the departure from those responsibilities**.

The CFA emphasized that **wilfulness** does not necessarily mean **knowledge of unlawfulness**, but rather **deliberate action** or **omission**. The **jury must be directed to consider whether the conduct was deliberate**, not merely **overlooked** or **inadvertent**.

#### **B. The Role of the Trial Judge in Directing the Jury**

The CFA held that the **trial judge had a duty to explain the alternative scenario** where the **bribery charge** was not accepted, and the **misconduct charge** was considered independently. The **directions must be tailored to the alternative case**, not just the primary case. The **jury must be given guidance on how to assess the seriousness of the conduct** in the absence of a finding of corruption.

The CFA criticized the **trial judge’s direction** that the jury should **acquit if the Beautiful Sunday interview account was true**, as it **implied that wilfulness meant deliberate action**, not **error of judgment**. The **defence argument** that the non-disclosure was an **error of judgment** was not adequately addressed in the **directions**.

#### **C. The Distinction Between Deliberate Non-Disclosure and Deliberate Concealment**

The CFA highlighted the **difference between deliberate non-disclosure** and **deliberate concealment**. While **concealment** implies **dishonesty**, **non-disclosure** may be the result of an **error of judgment**. The **jury must be directed to distinguish between the two**, and the **directions must reflect the possibility of non-corrupt impropriety**.

#### **D. The Seriousness of the Conduct**

The CFA emphasized that the **seriousness of the conduct** must be assessed in the **context of the public interest**, the **responsibilities of the office**, and the **nature of the departure from those responsibilities**. The **jury must be given guidance on how to assess the seriousness** of the conduct, particularly in the absence of a finding of corruption.

#### **E. The Role of the Jury in Assessing the Facts**

The CFA noted that the **jury is required to make an assessment of whether the alleged misconduct is serious enough** to warrant condemnation and punishment. The **jury must be given the tools to assess the seriousness** of the conduct, including the **context of the decision-making process**, the **nature of the obligation to disclose**, and the **consequences of non-disclosure**.

#### **F. The Importance of Proper Instructions in Criminal Cases**

The CFA held that the **trial judge has a duty to provide clear and adequate instructions** to the jury, particularly in complex cases where the **charges are interrelated**. The **directions must be tailored to the specific facts of the case**, and the **jury must be given the opportunity to consider the alternative scenarios**.

### 4. **Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case**

This case is **remarkable** for several reasons:

- **High-profile nature**: The case involved **Donald Tsang**, who was the **Chief Executive of Hong Kong**, making it a **high-profile political and legal matter**.
- **Dual charges**: The case involved **two charges**—**bribery** and **misconduct in public office**—which were **interrelated** but **not necessarily dependent on each other**.
- **Jury deadlock**: The **jury could not agree** on the **bribery charge**, raising questions about the **adequacy of the trial judge’s instructions** and the **possibility of a conviction on the misconduct charge** without the bribery charge being accepted.
- **Legal complexity**: The case involved **complex legal principles**, including the **elements of misconduct in public office**, the **mental element of wilfulness**, and the **seriousness of the conduct**.
- **Public interest**: The case had **significant public interest**, as it involved the **highest office in Hong Kong** and raised questions about **corruption, transparency, and accountability**.
- **Judicial review**: The case was **appealed to the Court of Final Appeal**, which is the **highest court in Hong Kong**, and the **decision had significant implications** for the interpretation of the **common law offence of misconduct in public office**.
