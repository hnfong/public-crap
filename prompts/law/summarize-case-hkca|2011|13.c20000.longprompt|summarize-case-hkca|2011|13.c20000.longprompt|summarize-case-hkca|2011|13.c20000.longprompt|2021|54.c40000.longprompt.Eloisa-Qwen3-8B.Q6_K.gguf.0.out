Okay, I need to tackle this case summary. Let me start by understanding the case. The case is about the constitutionality of the New Territories Small House Policy in Hong Kong. The applicants argue that the policy is discriminatory based on social origin and sex, violating the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. The respondents and interested party counter that the policy is protected under the Basic Law's provision on lawful traditional rights of indigenous inhabitants.

First, I'll summarize the facts. The Small House Policy allows indigenous villagers in the New Territories to apply for a small house grant once in their lifetime. The policy has been in place since 1972 and includes different forms of grants like free building licenses, private treaty grants, and exchanges. The applicants challenged its constitutionality, arguing discrimination. The court below found it discriminatory but then considered whether it falls under the Basic Law's protection of traditional rights.

Next, the arguments. Applicants focus on discrimination, while respondents emphasize the policy's historical roots and protection under the Basic Law. The legal principles involve interpreting the Basic Law, particularly the "lawful traditional rights" clause. The court's decision hinges on whether the policy's discriminatory aspects are justified by tradition and lawfulness.

For the ratio decidendi, the court's key points are that the policy's discriminatory nature is inherent but protected as a traditional right. They emphasized the historical context, the role of the Basic Law's drafting materials, and coherence with other provisions like BL120 and BL122. The court also addressed the coherence principle, linking the policy to international agreements like CEDAW reservations.

Finally, what's striking about the case? The court's detailed historical analysis and the emphasis on preserving discriminatory policies as traditional rights are remarkable. It shows the tension between modern equality principles and historical rights in a constitutional framework.

### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case revolves around the constitutionality of the **New Territories Small House Policy (Small House Policy)** in Hong Kong. This policy, introduced in 1972, allows indigenous villagers in the New Territories to apply for a small house grant once in their lifetime, subject to specific eligibility criteria. The policy includes three forms of grants: **free building licences**, **private treaty grants**, and **exchanges**. Applicants must be male, descended from residents of recognized villages in 1898, and meet other conditions such as land ownership and zoning requirements. The policy has been criticized for its inherent **discrimination based on sex and social origin**, as it excludes women and non-indigenous villagers.

The applicants challenged the policy's constitutionality, arguing that it violates the **Basic Law (BL)** and the **Hong Kong Bill of Rights (BOR)** by discriminating against non-indigenous individuals and female villagers. The respondents and interested party, however, contended that the policy falls under **BL40**, which protects the **lawful traditional rights and interests of the New Territories indigenous inhabitants (NTIIs)**. The court below initially found the policy discriminatory but then examined whether it qualifies as a protected traditional right under BL40. The appeals court ultimately upheld the constitutionality of the policy in its entirety, emphasizing its historical roots and the protections afforded by the Basic Law and related legislation.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties

**Applicants' Arguments:**  
The applicants argued that the Small House Policy is inherently discriminatory, violating **BL25** (equality before the law), **BL39** (prohibition of discrimination), and **BOR22** (equality and non-discrimination). They contended that the policy's restrictions on women and non-indigenous villagers constitute unlawful discrimination. Additionally, they claimed that the policy does not qualify as a **"lawful traditional right"** under BL40 because it lacks historical continuity, lawful recognition, and is not protected by the Basic Law's intent to uphold traditional rights. They further argued that the policy's discriminatory nature would not survive scrutiny under international agreements like the **CEDAW reservations**, which exempt certain discriminatory laws in Hong Kong.

**Respondents' and Interested Party's Arguments:**  
The respondents and interested party defended the policy as a **lawful traditional right** under BL40, emphasizing its historical origins in pre-1898 customs and its recognition in colonial and post-handover legislation. They argued that the policy's discriminatory aspects are justified by its role in preserving the NTIIs' traditional way of life and that the Basic Law's drafting materials and coherence with other provisions (e.g., **BL120** and **BL122**) support its constitutionality. They also highlighted the **Joint Declaration's Annex III**, which preserves small house grants beyond 1997, and the **CEDAW reservations**, which exempt the policy from discrimination challenges. They further contended that the policy's administrative and legislative continuity demonstrates its lawful and traditional nature.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) of the Case

The court's decision rests on a detailed analysis of the **Basic Law's provisions**, particularly **BL40**, and the **coherence principle** in constitutional interpretation. The key legal principles are as follows:

#### **(1) Interpretation of BL40: Lawful Traditional Rights of NTIIs**  
The court emphasized that **BL40** protects the **lawful traditional rights and interests of NTIIs**, which must satisfy four criteria:  
- **Existence of rights/interests**: The rights must be recognized in the legal system.  
- **Lawfulness**: The rights must be lawful under Hong Kong law on 1 July 1997 and not inconsistent with the Basic Law.  
- **Traditional nature**: The rights must trace back to pre-1898 customs or practices, retaining their essential features.  
- **Applicability to NTIIs**: The rights must be held by individuals qualifying as NTIIs.  

The court rejected the applicants' argument that **"lawful"** requires compliance with Qing law or pre-1997 standards, instead adopting a **post-1997 framework** where lawfulness is assessed against Hong Kong's domestic laws. It also clarified that **"traditional"** rights are those that existed in 1898 and have been preserved, even if modified over time, as long as their core features remain intact.

#### **(2) Historical Continuity and Recognition of the Small House Policy**  
The court conducted an exhaustive historical analysis to establish the policy's **traditional roots**. It found that the NTIIs' right to build small houses on their land originated from pre-colonial **customary tenure** and was recognized and institutionalized during the colonial era through **free building licences**, **private treaty grants**, and **exchanges**. The policy's continuity was reinforced by its inclusion in post-handover legislation, such as the **Buildings Ordinance (Application to the New Territories)** and the **Sex Discrimination Ordinance**, which exempted it from discrimination challenges under **SDO Schedule 5**.

#### **(3) Coherence with Other Basic Law Provisions**  
The court applied the **coherence principle**, requiring BL40 to be interpreted in harmony with other Basic Law articles, particularly **BL120** and **BL122**, which preserve land leases and small house grants beyond 1997. It also linked BL40 to the **CEDAW reservations**, which exempt discriminatory laws like the Small House Policy from international scrutiny. This coherence ensured that the policy's protection under BL40 was consistent with Hong Kong's constitutional and international obligations.

#### **(4) Overruling the Lower Court's Tracing Exercise**  
The court rejected the lower court's **"tracing exercise"** for determining traditional rights, which required rights to mirror pre-1898 practices. Instead, it adopted a **broader approach** emphasizing the retention of essential features, such as the NTIIs' right to apply for small house grants. This approach invalidated the lower court's distinction between **free building licences** (protected) and **private treaty grants/exchanges** (unprotected), as all forms of the policy were deemed to capture the policy's traditional essence.

#### **(5) Rejection of Discrimination Challenges**  
The court held that the policy's **inherent discrimination** is justified by its status as a **lawful traditional right**, shielding it from challenges under **BL25**, **BL39**, and **BOR22**. It emphasized that the Basic Law's purpose is to protect NTIIs' rights, even if discriminatory, as part of Hong Kong's historical and administrative framework. The **CEDAW reservations** further supported this by explicitly exempting the policy from discrimination challenges.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case

This case is remarkable for several reasons:  

- **Historical Depth and Legal Innovation**: The court's exhaustive historical analysis of the New Territories' land tenure system and the Small House Policy sets a precedent for interpreting constitutional provisions through a **longitudinal lens**, blending legal and historical scholarship.  

- **Protection of Discriminatory Policies**: The decision upholds a policy that explicitly discriminates based on sex and social origin, framing it as a **protected traditional right** under the Basic Law. This reflects a tension between modern equality principles and historical rights, raising questions about the limits of constitutional protection in preserving discriminatory practices.  

- **Coherence Principle in Action**: The court's emphasis on coherence between BL40, **BL120**, **BL122**, and the **CEDAW reservations** demonstrates how constitutional provisions can interact to shield policies from external scrutiny, even when they conflict with international norms.  

- **Administrative Continuity**: The case underscores the **administrative and legislative continuity** of the Small House Policy since 1972, highlighting its role as a cornerstone of Hong Kong's rural governance and the NTIIs' identity.  

- **Judicial Restraint**: The court's reluctance to overturn a policy with deep historical roots, despite its discriminatory nature, reflects a **deference to administrative decisions** and the perceived legitimacy of traditional rights in Hong Kong's constitutional framework.  

Overall, the case exemplifies the complex interplay between **constitutional law, historical tradition, and administrative policy** in Hong Kong, offering a nuanced perspective on the protection of rights in a post-colonial context. [end of text]
