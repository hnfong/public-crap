## KWOK CHEUK KIN AND ANOTHER v. DIRECTOR OF LANDS AND OTHERS [2021] HKCA 54; CACV 317/2019 – Case Summary

### 1. Facts Summary

This case concerned the constitutionality of the New Territories Small House Policy (the “Policy”), which allows male indigenous villagers of the New Territories (“NTIIs”) to apply for permission to build a small house on suitable land once in their lifetime. The policy has existed in various forms since 1972. The applicants challenged the policy as discriminatory based on social origin/birth and sex, violating articles 25 and 39 of the Basic Law and article 22 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. The core issue was whether the Policy fell within the protection of Article 40 of the Basic Law, which protects the “lawful traditional rights and interests” of NTIIs. The lower court found the policy discriminatory but held that only free building licenses under the policy were constitutional, as they were traceable to pre-1898 rights. This appeal concerned the entirety of the policy, including private treaty grants and land exchanges.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**Applicants:** Argued that the entire Small House Policy was *not* protected by Article 40. They contended that “lawful” meant justified differential treatment that did not infringe fundamental rights, and that the “Ding Rights” (the right to apply under the policy) were not true “rights or interests” but a discretionary government benefit. They also argued that the rights were not “traditional” as they weren’t traceable to pre-1898 practices.

**Respondents & Interested Party (Heung Yee Kuk):** Argued that the entirety of the Ding Rights *were* protected under Article 40. They claimed the Judge erred in limiting protection to free building licenses. They asserted that private treaty grants were lawful as they were a recognized administrative policy, and that the rights were “traditional” because they captured the essence of pre-1898 landholding practices. They emphasized the historical context and the intent of the Basic Law drafters to protect NTII rights, even if discriminatory. They also argued that the term “lawful” was descriptive, not restrictive, and that the policy’s continuity demonstrated its legitimacy.



### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The Court of Appeal comprehensively addressed the legal principles surrounding Article 40 of the Basic Law, focusing on the interpretation of “lawful traditional rights and interests of the NTIIs.” The core principles established are as follows:

**A. Contextual and Purposive Interpretation:** The Basic Law must be interpreted contextually and purposively, considering the historical background and the circumstances at the time of its enactment in 1990. This necessitates a detailed examination of the events leading up to the handover and the intentions of the drafters.

**B. Historical Context of NTII Rights:** The concept of an NTII originated in 1898 with the New Territories Lease. Early Colonial Government policy aimed to respect existing customs, but this was subject to general law.  The landholding system transitioned from common/customary tenure to Crown leases, with the Colonial Government actively managing land and introducing new systems.

**C. Recognition of Customary Practices:** The Colonial Government recognized the NTIIs’ custom of building houses on their land, officially endorsing it in 1959. This led to the granting of permissions through free building licenses, surrender/re-grant, and private treaty grants.

**D. Purpose of the Small House Policy:** The Policy was introduced in 1972 to address squatter problems and provide housing for villagers, but fundamentally continued the existing practice of recognizing and facilitating small house construction based on the long-held customs of the NTIIs.

**E. Interpretation of “Traditional Rights and Interests”:** The Court rejected the lower court’s strict “tracing exercise” requiring a direct link to pre-1898 rights. Instead, it held that the relevant question is whether the rights and interests existed as recognized lawful traditional rights *at the time of the Basic Law’s promulgation in 1990*.  The focus should be on the state of affairs in 1990, not 1898.  A right could be considered “traditional” even if it had evolved over time, as long as it retained its essential features.

**F. Interpretation of “Lawful”:** The Court clarified that “lawful” does not require a re-litigation of the legality of rights under Qing law or laws before 1997.  Rather, it means that the rights and interests were recognized as lawful within the Hong Kong legal system at the time the Basic Law was enacted.  The question is not whether the rights *were* lawful at some point in the past, but whether they *were recognized as* lawful in 1990.

**G. Coherence Principle & Annex III of the Joint Declaration:** The Basic Law must be read as a coherent whole. Articles 120 and 122, which implement Annex III of the Joint Declaration (protecting land leases and rights beyond 1997), are crucial.  The Court found that the rent benefits for small houses in Annex III implied an agreement to preserve the validity of the Small House Policy itself.

**H. CEDAW Reservations:** The UK and PRC Governments entered reservations regarding the application of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) to laws enabling male NTIIs to exercise property rights. The Court held that these reservations must inform the interpretation of the Basic Law, meaning that the discriminatory aspect of the Policy (favoring males) was constitutionally protected.

**I. Ding Rights as Rights and Interests:** The Court held that the Ding Rights, while stemming from a government policy, created legitimate expectations and legal obligations on the government, constituting a “right” for the purpose of Article 40.  An eligible NTII had a right to have their application determined in accordance with the policy.

**J. Overall Conclusion:** The Court concluded that the Ding Rights were, as a matter of historical fact, recognized as lawful traditional rights and interests of the NTIIs in the Hong Kong legal system at the time of the Basic Law’s enactment. Therefore, the entire Small House Policy was constitutional, despite its discriminatory nature.



### 4. Striking, Unusual or Remarkable Aspects

Several aspects of this case are striking:

*   **Deep Historical Dive:** The Court undertook an exceptionally detailed historical analysis, tracing the evolution of landholding practices in the New Territories back to the 19th century. This level of detail is unusual for constitutional litigation.
*   **Focus on Drafting Materials:** The Court placed significant weight on the drafting materials of the Basic Law, attempting to discern the intentions of the drafters.
*   **Political Context:** The case is deeply intertwined with the political context of the Sino-British negotiations leading up to the handover of Hong Kong. The need to address historical issues and maintain social stability clearly influenced the drafting of Article 40.
*   **CEDAW Reservations as a Key Factor:** The Court’s reliance on the CEDAW reservations to justify the discriminatory aspect of the Policy is remarkable. It highlights the complex interplay between international treaties and constitutional law in Hong Kong.
*   **Practical Implications:** The case has significant practical implications for land administration in the New Territories, confirming the continued validity of the Small House Policy and the rights of NTIIs.
*   **Lengthy Delay & Standing:** The phenomenal delay in bringing the challenge (over 40 years) and the applicants’ lack of standing raise questions about the appropriate scope of judicial review and the importance of timely legal challenges. The Court’s dismissal on these grounds, even after finding constitutional issues, underscores the importance of these procedural considerations.
* **The "Traceability" Debate:** The rejection of the lower court's strict "tracing" requirement is a significant development in the interpretation of Article 40, emphasizing the importance of the rights' existence at the time of the Basic Law's enactment rather than a rigid historical connection to pre-1898 practices.
