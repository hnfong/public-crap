**Facts of the Case**

The case of Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v. Chan Chun Chuen and Another [2011] HKCA 13; CACV 62/2010 is a probate case involving the will of Nina Wang, a wealthy businesswoman who died in 2007. The plaintiff, Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd, claimed that the 2006 will, which named Chan Chun Chuen as the beneficiary, was a forgery. The defendant, Chan Chun Chuen, argued that the 2006 will was genuine and that the 2002 will, which named the plaintiff as the beneficiary, was a forgery. The case involved a complex web of relationships between Nina Wang, Chan Chun Chuen, and other individuals, including a fung shui master, Mr. Ng Shung Mo, and a solicitor, Mr. Winfield Wong.

The facts of the case revealed that Nina Wang had been in a relationship with Chan Chun Chuen, a fung shui master, and had given him substantial sums of money.

**Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The Court of Appeal's decision in Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v. Chan Chun Chuen and Another [2011] HKCA 13; CACV 62/2010 established several important legal principles, including:

1. **The importance of handwriting analysis**: The court emphasized the importance of handwriting analysis in determining the authenticity of a signature. The court accepted the expert evidence of handwriting experts, Mr. Radley and Mr. Westwood, who concluded that the signatures on the 2006 will were not genuine.
2. **The significance of the "no-lose" argument**: The court rejected the defendant's argument that the accumulation of rare features in a signature made it more likely to be genuine. The court accepted the "no-lose" argument, which suggests that an accumulation of rare features can be indicative of forgery.
3. **The role of expert evidence in forgery cases**: The court highlighted the importance of expert evidence in forgery cases, particularly in handwriting analysis. The court accepted the expert evidence of handwriting experts, Mr. Radley and Mr. Westwood, who concluded that the signatures on the 2006 will were not genuine.
4. **The relevance of fung shui practices**: The court considered the relevance of Nina Wang's consistent use of fung shui practices, which the plaintiff argued was inconsistent with the 2006 will. The court found that the plaintiff's argument was not persuasive and that the defendant's relationship with Nina Wang was consistent with the 2006 will.
5. **The importance of the judge's discretion in determining costs**: The court emphasized the importance of the judge's discretion in determining costs in probate cases. The court accepted the judge's decision to order costs on an indemnity basis, given the defendant's egregious abuse of the process of the court.

The court's decision in Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v. Chan Chun Chuen and Another [2011] HKCA 13; CACV 62/2010 is significant because it highlights the importance of handwriting analysis, expert evidence, and the role of the judge's discretion in determining costs in probate cases.
