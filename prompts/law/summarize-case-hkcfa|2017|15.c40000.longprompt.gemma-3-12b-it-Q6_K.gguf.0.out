Okay, here's a breakdown of the *Secretary for Justice v. Chan Chi Wan Stephen* case, addressing your requested tasks.

**1. Summary of Facts**

Stephen Chan Chi Wan (Chan) was the General Manager (Broadcasting) at Television Broadcasts Ltd (TVB). He also hosted a popular TV show, "Be My Guest," receiving no extra pay for it.  He began appearing at external events, earning remuneration for these appearances, with the assistance of Tseng Pei Kun (Tseng), who acted as his agent.  Olympian City, a shopping mall, wanted to include a live segment of "Be My Guest" in their New Year's Eve Countdown show, and paid TVB $1.3 million for the show sponsorship.  They then separately engaged Chan (through Tseng) to appear on the Countdown show, paying him $112,000. Chan did not seek or obtain permission from TVB for this outside work, although it was known within TVB that he would be participating.  Chan and Tseng were charged with conspiring for an agent to accept an advantage, violating the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO).  The trial court acquitted them, but the Court of Appeal overturned that decision and remitted the case back to the trial court. The trial court again acquitted them, but the Court of Appeal again overturned that decision, convicting them and fining them. They appealed to the Court of Final Appeal.

**2. Summary of Arguments**

*   **The Prosecution (Secretary for Justice):** Argued that Chan's appearance on the Countdown show, facilitated by the payment from Olympian City, constituted an acceptance of an advantage "in relation to" TVB's affairs or business. They contended that Chan's participation, even if seemingly beneficial to TVB, could potentially influence or affect the station's interests, and that the Court of Appeal was correct in finding that Chan’s conduct fell within the scope of the POBO. They emphasized that the potential for influence or effect on TVB's business was the key factor, regardless of whether any actual detriment occurred.
*   **The Appellants (Chan and Tseng):** Argued that Chan's appearance was purely a personal, outside engagement, unrelated to his duties at TVB. They asserted that it did not "influence or affect" TVB's affairs or business, and that the payment was for his personal appearance as a celebrity, not for any action related to his role at TVB. They also argued that they had a reasonable excuse for accepting the payment, as TVB was aware of the arrangement and it was unlikely they would object. They further argued that the Court of Appeal misapplied the principles established in *Commissioner of the ICAC v Ch’ng Poh*.

**3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The Court of Final Appeal's judgment establishes several key legal principles concerning the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO), particularly section 9, which deals with corrupt transactions with agents. The core of the case revolves around the interpretation of the phrase "in relation to his principal's affairs or business."

*   **Mens Rea Requirement:** Section 9 requires proof of *mens rea* (guilty mind) for all essential elements of the offence. This means the prosecution must prove Chan knew or believed the payment was an inducement or reward for an act related to his principal's affairs.
*   **"In Relation To" - The Core Issue:** The Court extensively analyzed the meaning of "in relation to his principal's affairs or business."  Drawing heavily from *Ch’ng Poh*, the Court held that this phrase is restrictive and requires the agent's act or forbearance to be "aimed at" and "intended to influence or affect" the principal's affairs.  A mere connection or relationship is not sufficient. The Court rejected the Court of Appeal's reasoning that any involvement of TVB, even if beneficial, automatically meant the act was "in relation to" their business.
*   **No Requirement of Prejudice:** The Court explicitly stated that the POBO does not require proof that the principal's interests were actually prejudiced or harmed by the agent's actions. However, the act must still be aimed at and intended to influence or affect the principal’s affairs.
*   **Reasonable Excuse:** The Court affirmed that the burden of proving a reasonable excuse lies on the accused.  The Court considered whether Chan had a reasonable excuse for accepting the payment, finding that the fact that TVB knew of the arrangement and it was unlikely they would object constituted a reasonable excuse.
*   **Conspiracy and Section 24:** The Court addressed the interplay between conspiracy charges and section 24 of the Criminal Procedure Ordinance, which deals with the burden of proof regarding defenses. The Court held that section 24, which reverses the onus of proof for defenses, does not apply to conspiracy charges under the POBO. This is because the conspiracy charge itself does not contain the "without lawful authority or reasonable excuse" element that triggers section 24.
*   **The Importance of Purpose:** The Court emphasized that the POBO aims to prevent corruption and protect the integrity of agency relationships. The acceptance of an advantage without the principal's knowledge or consent, even if seemingly beneficial, can undermine that integrity and constitute a corrupt transaction.
*   **Rejection of Broad Interpretation:** The Court strongly rejected a broad interpretation of "in relation to" that would criminalize any payment to an agent without the principal's explicit consent, even if the payment is for a personal appearance and does not directly affect the principal's business.

**Novel/Controversial Points:**

*   **The "Influence or Affect" Test:** The Court's insistence on the "aimed at" and "intended to influence or affect" test for the "in relation to" phrase is a significant clarification of the POBO. It prevents the statute from being applied too broadly and potentially criminalizing innocent or beneficial transactions.
*   **Rejection of Prejudice Requirement:** While not requiring actual prejudice, the Court's emphasis on the act being "aimed at" and "intended to influence or affect" the principal's affairs effectively requires a degree of potential impact, even if not realized.
*   **Section 24 and Conspiracy:** The Court's finding that section 24 does not apply to conspiracy charges under the POBO is a nuanced point that clarifies the application of the burden of proof in complex cases.



**4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects**

*   **The Repeated Reversals:** The case is remarkable for the multiple reversals by the courts. The initial acquittal, followed by two reversals by the Court of Appeal, and then the final decision by the Court of Final Appeal, highlights the complexities of interpreting the POBO and the difficulty in applying it to specific factual scenarios.
*   **The "Be My Guest" Show:** The entire case hinges on a popular television show and the seemingly innocuous act of a celebrity appearing on it for payment. The fact that a relatively minor, personal engagement could lead to such a complex legal battle is quite striking.
*   **The Focus on Intent:** The Court's emphasis on the *mens rea* element and the "aimed at" and "intended to influence or affect" test underscores the importance of understanding the underlying purpose of the POBO – to prevent corruption and protect the integrity of agency relationships. The case demonstrates that a seemingly beneficial act can still be criminal if it is motivated by improper intent or undermines the trust inherent in an agency relationship.
*   **The Detailed Analysis of *Ch’ng Poh*:** The Court's meticulous examination and reinterpretation of the *Ch’ng Poh* decision demonstrates the ongoing evolution of legal principles and the importance of carefully scrutinizing precedent in complex cases. [end of text]
