## 1. Summary of Facts

The case of *Secretary for Justice v. Chan Chi Wan Stephen* concerns two appeals arising from a single transaction involving Stephen Chan Chi Wan ("Chan"), a General Manager (Broadcasting) at Television Broadcasts Ltd (TVB), and Tseng Pei Kun ("Tseng"), the sole director and shareholder of Idea Empire Advertising & Production Company Limited (IEAP). Chan hosted a popular TV show, "Be My Guest," and was engaged by third parties for external events, managed by Tseng.  Olympian City, a shopping mall, wanted Chan to appear on a live segment of "Be My Guest" during their New Year's Eve Countdown show, paying IEAP $160,000, of which $112,000 was passed on to Chan.  Chan did not seek or obtain permission from TVB for this appearance, despite a contractual obligation to do so. Both Chan and Tseng were charged with conspiring for an agent to accept an advantage, violating section 9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO). The initial trial judge acquitted them, but the Court of Appeal overturned this decision and remitted the case for consideration of a reasonable excuse defense. The trial judge again dismissed the charges, but the Court of Appeal again overturned this, convicting Chan and Tseng on the conspiracy charge and fining them. They appealed to the Court of Final Appeal, raising questions about the *mens rea* required for a section 9 offense and the proper approach to the reasonable excuse defense.

## 2. Summary of Arguments

**The Prosecution (Secretary for Justice):**

*   **Regarding *mens rea*:** The prosecution argued that Chan's appearance on the "Be My Guest" segment *did* relate to TVB's affairs or business because it would influence or affect TVB's audience ratings and contractual relationship with Olympian City. They contended that the prosecution did not need to prove actual prejudice to TVB; the mere potential for influence was sufficient.
*   **Regarding reasonable excuse:** The prosecution argued that Chan's failure to obtain permission from TVB did not constitute a reasonable excuse. They maintained that the fact that the appearance was beneficial to TVB did not negate the offense.
*   **Regarding Conspiracy:** The prosecution argued that section 24 of the POBO, which deals with the burden of proof for defenses, should apply to conspiracy charges, requiring the defendants to prove a reasonable excuse.

**The Appellants (Chan and Tseng):**

*   **Regarding *mens rea*:** The appellants argued that Chan's appearance was purely a moonlighting activity, unrelated to his duties at TVB and not intended to influence or affect the company's affairs. They asserted that the appearance was beneficial to TVB and did not conflict with its interests.
*   **Regarding reasonable excuse:** The appellants contended that Chan had a reasonable excuse because he genuinely believed that TVB would not object to his appearance, given the show's popularity and the fact that TVB was aware of his involvement. They argued that the payment was essentially a formality and that TVB implicitly consented to the arrangement.
*   **Regarding Conspiracy:** The appellants argued that section 24 should not apply to conspiracy charges, maintaining that the prosecution should bear the burden of proving that the agreement would necessarily result in a violation of the POBO.



## 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The Court of Final Appeal's judgment in *Secretary for Justice v. Chan Chi Wan Stephen* establishes several significant legal principles concerning the interpretation and application of section 9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO). The case is notable for its detailed analysis of the *mens rea* requirement and the scope of the reasonable excuse defense, particularly in the context of agency law and the prevention of corruption.

**A. *Mens Rea* and the "In Relation To" Test:**

The Court firmly rejected the Court of Appeal's reasoning that any connection between an agent's actions and their principal's business automatically satisfies the "in relation to" requirement of section 9. Drawing heavily from *Commissioner of the ICAC v. Ch’ng Poh*, the Court emphasized that the act or forbearance must be "aimed at" and "intended to influence or affect" the principal's affairs or business. This is not merely a matter of a tangential connection; there must be a demonstrable purpose to impact the principal's interests. The Court clarified that the absence of actual prejudice to the principal's interests does not negate the offense, but the act must still be directed towards influencing or affecting the principal's business.  The Court emphasized that the removal of the word "corruptly" from the POBO did not mean that the prosecution needed to prove a corrupt motive, but it did mean that the focus shifted to the nature and purpose of the transaction.

**B. Reasonable Excuse Defense:**

The Court acknowledged that the burden of proving a reasonable excuse lies on the accused, as stipulated by section 24 of the POBO. However, the Court’s reasoning on this point is nuanced. While upholding the principle of the reverse onus, the Court implicitly questioned the application of section 24 to conspiracy charges, suggesting that the prosecution should bear the burden of proving the elements of the offense, including the absence of a reasonable excuse, in conspiracy cases. The Court found that Chan had a reasonable excuse because he genuinely believed that his principal (TVB) would not object to his appearance, effectively constituting implied consent. This highlights the importance of the agent's subjective belief and the circumstances surrounding the acceptance of the advantage.

**C. Application of *Ch’ng Poh*:**

The Court’s interpretation of *Ch’ng Poh* is a central element of the judgment. The Court reaffirmed the Privy Council's emphasis on the "aimed at" and "intended to influence or affect" test, rejecting the Court of Appeal's broader interpretation that any connection to the principal's business is sufficient. The Court also clarified that the absence of a direct, adverse impact on the principal's business does not automatically preclude the application of section 9. The focus remains on the agent's intent and the nature of the transaction.

**D. Conspiracy and Section 24:**

The Court’s analysis of the interplay between section 9 and section 24 in the context of conspiracy charges is particularly novel and controversial. While acknowledging the general applicability of section 24, the Court expressed reservations about its application to conspiracy charges, suggesting that it would undermine the fundamental principle that the prosecution bears the burden of proving all elements of an offense. The Court’s reasoning hinges on the interpretation of section 12A(1) of the POBO, which extends "rules of evidence" to conspiracies, but the Court found that section 24, as a reverse onus provision, is not a rule of evidence in the relevant sense. This aspect of the judgment leaves open the question of whether section 24 should be applied to conspiracy charges in future cases.

**E. Fiduciary Duty and the Purpose of the POBO:**

The Court underscored the importance of fiduciary duties in agency relationships and the purpose of the POBO in preventing corruption. The Court emphasized that the POBO aims to safeguard the integrity of agency relationships by prohibiting agents from accepting advantages that could compromise their loyalty to their principals. The Court’s reasoning aligns with the broader principle that the acceptance of an advantage without the principal’s knowledge or consent, even if seemingly beneficial, can undermine the trust and confidence inherent in the agency relationship.



**Novel and Controversial Points:**

*   **Narrowing of the "In Relation To" Test:** The Court's strict interpretation of the "in relation to" test significantly narrows the scope of section 9, potentially limiting its application in future cases. This is a departure from the Court of Appeal's more expansive view.
*   **Questioning the Application of Section 24 to Conspiracy:** The Court's reservations about applying section 24 to conspiracy charges are a significant development in Hong Kong criminal law. This aspect of the judgment could have far-reaching implications for the prosecution of conspiracy offenses under the POBO and other statutes.
*   **Emphasis on Subjective Belief:** The Court's finding that Chan had a reasonable excuse based on his genuine belief that TVB would not object highlights the importance of the agent's subjective state of mind in assessing the reasonableness of the excuse. This places a greater burden on the prosecution to disprove the agent's belief. [end of text]
