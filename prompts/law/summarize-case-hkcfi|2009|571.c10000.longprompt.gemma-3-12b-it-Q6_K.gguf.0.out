## 1. Summary of Facts

This case concerns Chan Ming Lok, who was convicted of possessing an offensive weapon, a knife, in a public place in Hong Kong in violation of section 33(1) of the Public Order Ordinance. Police officers observed Chan walking through various streets late at night, exhibiting behavior they found suspicious. He was eventually stopped and questioned about the knife found in his rucksack. Chan explained he was a former cook living in Shenzhen, often returning late at night and carrying the knife for self-defense due to concerns about robbery. He claimed he had previously brought the knife through customs without issue. The magistrate found Chan guilty, citing the knife's suitability for causing injury. The appeal centered on the interpretation of "offensive weapon" under section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance and whether the magistrate correctly categorized the knife.

## 2. Summary of Arguments

**Appellant (Chan Ming Lok), represented by Mr. Wong:**

*   **Challenge to the Definition of "Offensive Weapon":** Mr. Wong argued the magistrate wrongly concluded the knife was an offensive weapon based on its suitability for causing injury. He referenced *R v. Chong Ah Choi & Others*, suggesting that, in light of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, the category of "suitable for causing injury" within the definition of "offensive weapon" might effectively be repealed.
*   **Lack of Intention to Use in Hong Kong:** He contended that even if the knife was intended for self-defense, it was solely for use in China, not Hong Kong, and therefore did not fall within the definition of an offensive weapon in the context of the Hong Kong offense.
*   **Insufficient Basis for Finding:** He argued the magistrate's reasoning in her Statement of Findings was flawed, as she didn't explicitly state which category of offensive weapon she believed the knife fell under, and her reference to its sharpness implied reliance on the potentially invalid "suitable for causing injury" category.

**Respondent (Secretary of Justice), represented by Miss Lam:**

*   **Acceptance of Three Categories:** Miss Lam conceded that the Secretary of Justice accepted that only three categories of offensive weapon (made for, adapted for, or intended for causing injury) remained valid, effectively abandoning the argument that the "suitable for causing injury" category still applied.
*   **Magistrate's Experience and Understanding:** She argued that despite the unclear reasoning, the magistrate was experienced and familiar with the offense, and her findings should be respected.
*   **Admission of Intent:** She emphasized Chan's admission to the police that he carried the knife for self-defense, implying an intention to use it against another person, even if only in self-defense in China. She argued this admission was sufficient to establish the offense.



## 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The core legal issue in *HKSAR v. Chan Ming Lok* revolves around the interpretation of "offensive weapon" under section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance and the potential impact of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance on that definition. The case highlights a significant ambiguity in Hong Kong law and raises questions about the continued validity of a specific element within the statutory definition.

**1. The Ambiguity of Section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance:**

Section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance defines "offensive weapon" through four categories: (a) made for causing injury, (b) adapted for use for causing injury, (c) suitable for causing injury, and (d) intended by the person having it for use for causing injury. The court acknowledged that the wording regarding suitability for causing injury (category (c)) has been questioned since *R v. Chong Ah Choi & Others* [1994] 2 HKCLR 263, with Bokhary JA suggesting it might need to be construed as repealed to comply with the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance.  The crucial point is that the legislature has *not* formally amended the ordinance to remove this category, leaving it in a state of legal uncertainty. The court noted this was "a trap to the unwary."

**2. The Respondent's Concession and its Significance:**

The Secretary of Justice's concession that only categories (a), (b), and (d) are valid is a pivotal development. This concession effectively acknowledges the concerns raised in *Chong Ah Choi* and signals a potential shift in the government's legal position. However, the court expressed surprise that the legislature had not yet formally amended the ordinance to reflect this understanding, highlighting a disconnect between judicial interpretation and legislative action. This concession is crucial because it frames the entire appeal. The court is no longer arguing about whether category (c) *exists*, but rather whether the magistrate *incorrectly* relied on it.

**3. The Magistrate's Error and the Standard of Review:**

The court found that the magistrate's reasoning in her Statement of Findings was deficient. While acknowledging the magistrate's experience, the court determined that she did not clearly articulate the basis for her finding that the knife was an offensive weapon. Specifically, the magistrate’s statement that the knife was “pointed and quite sharp and could cause injury to the person” without explicitly referencing the appellant’s intention (category (d)) raised the possibility that she relied on the potentially invalid "suitable for causing injury" category (c).  This ambiguity was enough for the court to express concern that the conviction might have been based on the wrong legal ground.

The court’s approach to reviewing the magistrate’s decision was constrained by the fact that it was a rehearing on the papers. This meant the court could not re-evaluate the credibility of witnesses directly. However, it could assess whether, *assuming* the magistrate’s findings regarding credibility were correct, the conviction could nonetheless stand.

**4. The Importance of Intention (Category (d)):**

Despite the potential error in the magistrate’s reasoning, the court ultimately upheld the conviction. The court emphasized the appellant’s admission to the police that he carried the knife for self-defense, even if that self-defense was intended to occur in China. The court reasoned that this admission demonstrated an intention to use the knife as a weapon against another person, satisfying category (d) of the definition. The court explicitly stated that the fact the intended use might occur in the Mainland was not relevant. This demonstrates a broad interpretation of "intention" within the context of the offense.

**5. Self-Defense and "Reasonable Excuse":**

The case also touches upon the issue of self-defense as a "reasonable excuse" for possessing an offensive weapon. The court reiterated that self-defense alone is not a sufficient excuse when there is no evidence of imminent danger. This reinforces the principle that carrying an offensive weapon, even for defensive purposes, is generally unlawful unless there is a credible and immediate threat.

**Novel and Controversial Points:**

*   **The Lingering Validity of Category (c):** The most novel and controversial aspect of the case is the continued existence of the "suitable for causing injury" category in the Public Order Ordinance despite the concerns raised in *Chong Ah Choi*. The court’s observation that this creates a "trap to the unwary" highlights the need for legislative reform.
*   **The Scope of "Intention":** The court’s interpretation of "intention" to encompass the possibility of using the knife against another person, even in self-defense, is a broad one. It suggests that the location of the intended use (Hong Kong vs. Mainland China) is irrelevant to the offense. This could have implications for future cases involving individuals carrying weapons for self-defense in situations where they anticipate potential threats outside of Hong Kong.
*   **The Disconnect Between Judicial Interpretation and Legislative Action:** The court’s criticism of the legislature for failing to amend the ordinance to reflect the evolving legal understanding of "offensive weapon" underscores a broader issue of legislative responsiveness to judicial pronouncements.



In conclusion, *HKSAR v. Chan Ming Lok* is a complex case that exposes a significant ambiguity in Hong Kong law. While the conviction was ultimately upheld based on the appellant’s admission of intent, the case highlights the urgent need for legislative reform to clarify the definition of "offensive weapon" and eliminate the potential for misapplication of the law. The case serves as a cautionary tale for both the judiciary and the legislature regarding the importance of aligning statutory language with evolving legal principles. [end of text]
