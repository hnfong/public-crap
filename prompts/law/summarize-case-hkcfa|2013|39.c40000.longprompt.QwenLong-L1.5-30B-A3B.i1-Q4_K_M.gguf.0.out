Okay, let's tackle this case summary. The user provided a detailed legal case from Hong Kong, W v. The Registrar of Marriages, and wants four specific tasks done. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to summarize the facts briefly. The case is about a post-operative male-to-female transsexual, W, who wants to marry her male partner. The Registrar of Marriages refused because she's considered a male under the Marriage Ordinance. The case went through first instance and Court of Appeal, both upholding the Registrar's decision. The appeal to the Court of Final Appeal is the focus here. I should mention her medical history, the surgeries she underwent, and the legal context in Hong Kong compared to other countries.

Next, the arguments of the two parties. The appellant (W) argues that she should be recognized as a woman for marriage purposes, relying on constitutional rights under the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights. The Registrar (respondent) argues that the law follows the Corbett decision, which uses biological criteria at birth, and that changing the law should be left to the legislature. I need to make sure I capture both sides clearly without getting too bogged down in details.

Then, the legal principles (ratio decidendi). This is the meaty part. The court had to decide on statutory construction and constitutional compatibility. The key points are the Corbett approach versus the evolving standards post-Goodwin. The court rejected the Corbett criteria as too restrictive, emphasizing that the constitutional right to marry requires considering psychological and social factors, not just biological. They also held that the statutory provisions impair the essence of the right to marry. I need to explain how the court distinguished between statutory interpretation and constitutional review, and why the Corbett criteria are outdated now. The part about the ECtHR's Goodwin decision is crucial here. Also, the court's reasoning on the living instrument doctrine for the Basic Law and Bill of Rights.

Finally, anything striking or unusual. The case is notable for being a landmark in trans rights in Hong Kong, especially since it's a common law jurisdiction. The court's rejection of the Corbett test after decades of reliance on it is a big deal. Also, the fact that the court allowed the appeal but suspended the declaration for 12 months to let the legislature act is a strategic move. The mention of the suicide of Louise Chan and Sasha Moon highlights the real-world impact, which is poignant. The court's emphasis on human dignity and the need to avoid an "intermediate zone" for trans people is another striking point.

Wait, let me check if I missed any key elements. The court's discussion on the constitutional right to marry versus the statutory definition. They said the statutory construction was correct (Corbett approach), but the provisions are unconstitutional because they don't align with the constitutional right. So the ratio decidendi is that while the law is correctly interpreted as per Corbett, it's unconstitutional because it fails to respect the constitutional right to marry. The court didn't strike down the law but gave a remedial interpretation to include post-operative transsexuals.

Also, the dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Chan is important. He argued that the traditional concept of marriage shouldn't be changed by the court and that it's a matter for the legislature. The majority, however, saw the constitutional right as requiring a broader interpretation.

For the legal principles, I need to detail how the court analyzed the Corbett criteria, the role of medical advances, societal changes, and the ECtHR's Goodwin decision. The court's reasoning that procreation isn't essential to marriage anymore, which was a key point in Corbett. The court also rejected the idea that the legislature should handle it, saying the court has a duty to interpret the constitution to protect rights.

Wait, the user mentioned focusing on novel or controversial points. The court's rejection of the Corbett test as outdated is novel in Hong Kong. Also, the emphasis on psychological and social factors over biological ones is a shift. The court's stance that the right to marry's essence is impaired if a trans person can't marry in their acquired gender is a significant departure from previous cases.

For the striking aspects, the 12-month
