Okay, let's tackle this case summary. The user provided a detailed legal case from Hong Kong, W v. The Registrar of Marriages, and wants four specific tasks done. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to summarize the facts briefly. The case is about a post-operative male-to-female transsexual, W, who wants to marry her male partner. The Registrar of Marriages refused because she's considered a male under the Marriage Ordinance. The case went through first instance and Court of Appeal, both upholding the Registrar's decision. The appeal to the Court of Final Appeal is the focus here. I should mention her medical history, the surgeries she underwent, and the legal context in Hong Kong compared to other countries.

Next, the arguments of the two parties. The appellant (W) argues that she should be recognized as a woman for marriage purposes, relying on constitutional rights under the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights. The Registrar (respondent) argues that the law follows the Corbett decision, which uses biological criteria at birth, and that changing the law should be left to the legislature. I need to make sure I capture both sides clearly without getting too bogged down in details.

Then, the legal principles (ratio decidendi). This is the meaty part. The court had to decide on statutory construction and constitutional compatibility. The key points are the Corbett approach versus the evolving standards post-Goodwin. The court rejected the Corbett criteria as too restrictive, emphasizing that the constitutional right to marry requires considering psychological and social factors, not just biological. They also held that the statutory provisions impair the essence of the right to marry. I need to explain how the court distinguished between statutory interpretation and constitutional review, and why the Corbett criteria are outdated now. The part about the ECtHR's Goodwin decision is crucial here. Also, the court's reasoning on the living instrument doctrine for the Basic Law and Bill of Rights.

Finally, anything striking or unusual. The case is notable for being a landmark in trans rights in Hong Kong, especially since it's a common law jurisdiction. The court's rejection of the Corbett test after decades of reliance on it is a big deal. Also, the fact that the court allowed the appeal but suspended the declaration for 12 months to let the legislature act is a strategic move. The mention of the suicide of Louise Chan and Sasha Moon highlights the real-world impact, which is poignant. The court's emphasis on human dignity and the need to avoid an "intermediate zone" for trans people is another striking point.

Wait, let me check if I missed any key elements. The court's discussion on the constitutional right to marry versus the statutory definition. They said the statutory construction was correct (Corbett approach), but the provisions are unconstitutional because they don't align with the constitutional right. So the ratio decidendi is that while the law is correctly interpreted as per Corbett, it's unconstitutional because it fails to respect the constitutional right to marry. The court didn't strike down the law but gave a remedial interpretation to include post-operative transsexuals.

Also, the dissenting opinion by Mr. Justice Chan is important. He argued that the traditional concept of marriage shouldn't be changed by the court and that it's a matter for the legislature. The majority, however, saw the constitutional right as requiring a broader interpretation.

For the legal principles, I need to detail how the court analyzed the Corbett criteria, the role of medical advances, societal changes, and the ECtHR's Goodwin decision. The court's reasoning that procreation isn't essential to marriage anymore, which was a key point in Corbett. The court also rejected the idea that the legislature should handle it, saying the court has a duty to interpret the constitution to protect rights.

Wait, the user mentioned focusing on novel or controversial points. The court's rejection of the Corbett test as outdated is novel in Hong Kong. Also, the emphasis on psychological and social factors over biological ones is a shift. The court's stance that the right to marry's essence is impaired if a trans person can't marry in their acquired gender is a significant departure from previous cases.

For the striking aspects, the 12-month suspension for legislative action is notable. Also, the fact that Hong Kong was lagging behind other jurisdictions like the UK, Australia, etc., which had already recognized such marriages. The mention of the suicides of trans women in Hong Kong underscores the urgency of the case.

Let me make sure I didn't mix up any details. The appellant is W, a post-operative MTF transsexual. The Registrar refused marriage because she's biologically male. The court held that the statutory definition (Corbett) is correct, but the law is unconstitutional because it doesn't align with the constitutional right to marry. So they gave a remedial interpretation to include her as a woman for marriage purposes.

Wait, the court said the statutory construction was correct (so the law does use Corbett criteria), but the law is unconstitutional because it doesn't comply with the Basic Law. So the ratio decidendi is that the law is unconstitutional in its application, not that the statutory construction was wrong. The court interpreted the law to include transsexuals under the constitutional right.

I need to clarify that in the summary. The court didn't say the law was wrongly interpreted; they said the law, as interpreted, is unconstitutional. So the remedial interpretation is to read the law in a way that aligns with the constitution, even if that means going beyond the Corbett criteria.

Also, the court's discussion on the "living instrument" doctrine is key. They applied it to the Basic Law and Bill of Rights, saying they should adapt to changing circumstances. The dissenting judge argued against that, saying it's a social policy issue for the legislature.

Another point: the court rejected the argument that there's no consensus in Hong Kong for such a change. They cited the ECtHR's approach in Goodwin, which looked at evolving standards, not consensus. The dissenting judge mentioned consensus, but the majority didn't rely on that.

For the striking elements, the fact that the court allowed the appeal but suspended the declaration is a procedural nuance. Also, the detailed medical and psychological evidence presented about transsexualism, which the court considered in depth. The mention of the Gender Identity Team in Hong Kong shows the local context of trans healthcare.

Wait, the user asked for "anything striking, unusual or remarkable." The suicides of Louise Chan and Sasha Moon are a tragic backdrop, which the court referenced. That's a human element that's remarkable in the context of the legal case. Also, the court's emphasis on human dignity and the "intermediate zone" concept from the Goodwin case is a powerful statement.

Let me check if I covered all four tasks. Facts: check. Arguments: check. Legal principles: need to make sure it's detailed, focusing on the ratio. Striking aspects: check.

Wait, the user specified "ratio decidendi," which is the legal principle that the court relied on to decide the case. So the key ratio is that the statutory provisions, while correctly interpreted as per Corbett, are unconstitutional because they impair the essence of the constitutional right to marry. The court's remedial interpretation allows post-operative transsexuals to marry in their acquired gender.

Also, the court's reasoning that the Corbett criteria are incomplete because they ignore psychological and social factors, which are now well-understood. The medical advances since Corbett (1970) mean that the criteria are outdated. The court cited the ECtHR's Goodwin decision as pivotal, which shifted the standard in the UK.

I should make sure to highlight that the court didn't just follow Goodwin but applied it to the Hong Kong context, emphasizing that the Basic Law is a living instrument. The dissenting opinion's argument about social policy vs. judicial role is a key contrast.

For the legal principles section, I need to structure it in multiple paragraphs, detailing the statutory construction, the constitutional analysis, the rejection of Corbett, the role of the ECtHR, and the remedial interpretation. The novel points are the court's departure from Corbett, the emphasis on psychological factors, and the conclusion that the law impairs the essence of the right to marry.

Wait, the court said the statutory construction was correct (so the law does use Corbett), but the law is unconstitutional. So the ratio is that the law, as interpreted, is unconstitutional. Therefore, the court must interpret the law in a way that complies with the constitution, which means including transsexuals. So the ratio decidendi is that the constitutional right to marry requires a broader interpretation than the Corbett criteria, and the statutory provisions must be read to accommodate that.

Yes, that's the key. The court's remedial interpretation is the ratio. So the legal principles are that the constitutional right to marry under the Basic Law and Bill of Rights necessitates a reinterpretation of the Marriage Ordinance to include post-operative transsexuals, as the Corbett criteria are outdated and fail to protect the essence of the right.

I think that's covered. Now, making sure the summary is concise but thorough. Let me check the word count. The user said no word limit for the legal principles, so I can be detailed. But the other parts need to be brief.

Wait, the user's task 3 says "summarize the legal principles (ratio decidendi) of the case. Be detailed and thorough. There is no word limit. Use multiple paragraphs. If applicable, focus on the points that might be novel or controversial."

So I need to make sure that the legal principles section is detailed, highlighting the novel aspects like the rejection of Corbett, the living instrument doctrine, the emphasis on psychological factors, and the constitutional analysis.

Also, the court's reasoning that the right to marry's essence is impaired because W can't marry a man in her acquired gender, which the ECtHR in Goodwin had already established. The court explicitly cited Goodwin's reasoning about it being "artificial to assert that post-operative transsexuals have not been deprived of the right to marry."

Another point: the court rejected the argument that the legislature should handle it, saying the court has a duty to interpret the constitution to protect rights. The dissenting judge argued that it's a social policy issue for the legislature, but the majority disagreed.

Okay, I think I have all the elements. Let me structure the answer according to the four tasks. Make sure each part is clear and concise, especially the facts and arguments. For the legal principles, go into depth on the key points, especially the novel ones. Then, the striking aspects should include the human rights angle, the suspension of the declaration, and the tragic context of the suicides.

### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts  
The case concerns **W**, a post-operative male-to-female transsexual (MTF) resident of Hong Kong, who underwent sex reassignment surgery (SRS) in Thailand and later in Hong Kong. After a full medical and psychological assessment, she was certified by the Hospital Authority as having a changed gender to female, enabling her to update her identity card and passport to reflect her acquired gender. However, the **Registrar of Marriages** refused to permit her to marry her male partner, citing the *Marriage Ordinance* (MO) and *Matrimonial Causes Ordinance* (MCO), which define marriage as the union of "one man and one woman." The Registrar argued that W’s biological sex at birth (male) remains legally fixed, and SRS does not alter this. W challenged the decision via judicial review, arguing she qualifies as a "woman" for marriage purposes under Hong Kong’s constitutional rights to marry (Article 37 of the Basic Law and Article 19(2) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights). The case reached the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) after failing at first instance and in the Court of Appeal. The CFA ultimately allowed the appeal, holding that the statutory provisions were unconstitutional in their application to W.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties  
**Appellant (W):**  
- Argued that she qualifies as a "woman" for marriage purposes under the constitutional right to marry (Articles 37 and 19(2) of the Basic Law and Bill of Rights).  
- Contended that the *Corbett* test (which relies solely on biological criteria fixed at birth) is outdated, given medical advances, societal changes, and the European Court of Human Rights’ (ECtHR) *Goodwin* decision.  
- Emphasized that her psychological, social, and medical transition (including SRS) renders her a woman in all relevant respects, and denying her the right to marry a man violates her constitutional right to marry.  
- Argued that the statutory provisions (MO s.40 and MCO s.20(1)(d)) are unconstitutional because they impair the "essence" of the right to marry.  

**Respondent (Registrar of Marriages):**  
- Argued that the *Corbett* test remains legally binding, as Hong Kong’s statutes (MCO s.20(1)(d)) explicitly replicate the UK’s *Nullity of Marriage Act 1971*, which endorsed *Corbett*.  
- Maintained that marriage must be defined by biological sex at birth, as the institution is inherently tied to procreation (citing *Hyde v Hyde* and *Corbett*).  
- Submitted that the issue should be resolved by the legislature, not the courts, due to the "far-reaching ramifications" of changing the definition of marriage.  
- Argued there is no societal or international consensus in Hong Kong supporting such a change, and the law should not depart from traditional concepts of marriage.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) delivered a **landmark ruling** that fundamentally redefined the legal status of post-operative transsexuals in Hong Kong, emphasizing **constitutional supremacy** over statutory interpretation. The ratio decidendi centers on three interconnected pillars:  

#### **(a) Rejection of the *Corbett* Test as Outdated and Incomplete**  
The CFA unequivocally rejected the *Corbett* approach (which holds that biological sex at birth is immutable and determinative for marriage), deeming it **inadequate and inconsistent with modern medical, social, and constitutional realities**. The Court acknowledged that *Corbett*’s reasoning—rooted in the premise that procreative intercourse is essential to marriage—has been **eroded by societal evolution**. The Court cited *Goodwin v UK* (2002), where the ECtHR held that the UK’s refusal to permit transsexual marriage violated Article 12 of the ECHR, as pivotal. The CFA reasoned that:  
- **Procreation is no longer the "essential" purpose of marriage** in contemporary society. Modern marriage is increasingly defined by companionship, mutual support, and choice, not procreation (citing *Bellinger v Bellinger* and Thorpe LJ’s dissenting judgment).  
- **Biological criteria alone are insufficient** to assess sexual identity. The Court emphasized that sexual identity is multidimensional, encompassing **psychological (self-perception), social (role), and medical (treatment) factors**, not merely chromosomal, gonadal, or genital traits.  
- **Medical advances** since *Corbett* (1970) have rendered the *Corbett* criteria obsolete. SRS is now a well-established, publicly funded treatment for gender dysphoria, and transsexuals are recognized as persons of their acquired gender for most legal purposes (e.g., identity cards, passports).  

The Court explicitly rejected the Registrar’s argument that the *Corbett* test should be retained, stating:  
> *"The Corbett criteria which underlie the construction of MCO section 20(1)(d) and MO section 40 must be regarded as too restrictive and should no longer be accepted."*  

#### **(b) Constitutional Supremacy and the "Essence" of the Right to Marry**  
The CFA held that the statutory provisions (MO s.40 and MCO s.20(1)(d)), as interpreted under *Corbett*, **unconstitutionally impair the "essence" of the right to marry** guaranteed by Articles 37 and 19(2) of the Basic Law and Bill of Rights. The Court clarified that:  
- The constitutional right to marry **must not be reduced to a mere technicality** (e.g., biological sex at birth). Instead, it must be interpreted to **protect the core human dignity and autonomy** of individuals.  
- The *Goodwin* decision established that denying a post-operative transsexual the right to marry in their acquired gender **"artificially" deprives them of the right to marry**, as they live as and are recognized as their acquired gender. The Court adopted this reasoning:  
  > *"In the Court’s view, she may therefore claim that the very essence of her right to marry has been infringed."*  
- The Court rejected the Registrar’s claim that the law merely excludes transsexuals from marrying *in their acquired gender* but permits them to marry *in their birth gender* (e.g., W could marry a woman). The Court stressed that **W’s lived reality** (as a woman in a relationship with a man) makes this distinction meaningless:  
  > *"She has no possibility of doing so. In the Court’s view, she may therefore claim that the very essence of her right to marry has been infringed."*  

#### **(c) Remedial Interpretation Over Legislative Supremacy**  
The CFA **rejected the argument that the issue should be left to the legislature**, a stance previously endorsed in *Bellinger v Bellinger*. The Court held that:  
- The **Basic Law and Bill of Rights are "living instruments"** that must evolve with societal changes, and courts have a **duty to interpret statutes to align with constitutional rights** (citing *Ng Ka Ling v Director of Immigration*).  
- A **remedial interpretation**—reading "woman" and "female" to include post-operative transsexuals—was **constitutionally required**, not a judicial overreach. The Court explicitly stated:  
  > *"It is necessary in principle that a remedial interpretation should be given to MCO section 20(1)(d) and MO section 40."*  
- The Court **did not strike down the statutes** but **declared them unconstitutional in their current application** and mandated a remedial interpretation. It also **suspended the declaration for 12 months** to allow legislative reform (citing *Koo Sze Yiu v Chief Executive*), acknowledging the need for systemic solutions (e.g., a gender recognition framework like the UK’s *Gender Recognition Act 2004*).  

#### **(d) Novel and Controversial Aspects of the Ratio Decidendi**  
- **Rejection of *Corbett* as a binding precedent**: The CFA explicitly distanced itself from *Corbett*’s biological determinism, a stance that had long dominated common law jurisdictions. This marked a **significant departure from decades of jurisprudence** and aligned Hong Kong with the ECtHR’s *Goodwin* decision.  
- **Constitutional primacy over statutory construction**: The Court prioritized the constitutional right to marry over the statutory definition, a bold move that **redefined the role of courts in protecting minority rights**. The dissenting judge (Chan PJ) argued that such a change was a "social policy" issue for the legislature, but the majority rejected this, emphasizing that **constitutional rights cannot be deferred to legislative convenience**.  
- **Rejection of "consensus" as a barrier to constitutional interpretation**: The Registrar argued that Hong Kong lacked societal consensus to permit transsexual marriage, but the CFA dismissed this, citing *Goodwin*’s reasoning that **evolving societal standards—not consensus—should inform constitutional interpretation**. The Court noted:  
  > *"Reliance on the absence of a majority consensus as a reason for rejecting a minority’s claim is inimical in principle to fundamental rights."*  
- **Human dignity as the cornerstone of the right to marry**: The Court anchored its reasoning in the **"very essence of the Convention is respect for human dignity and human freedom"** (*Goodwin*), framing the right to marry as inseparable from **autonomy and self-determination**. This elevated the case beyond a technical legal dispute to a **moral and human rights imperative**.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case  
Several elements of the case stand out as extraordinary:  
1. **The Tragic Backdrop of Transgender Suicides**: The Court explicitly referenced the **suicides of Louise Chan (2004) and Sasha Moon (2004)**, two transgender women in Hong Kong who died by suicide after facing public humiliation and discrimination. This contextualized the case as **not merely legal but a matter of life and death**, underscoring the urgency of the Court’s ruling.  
2. **A Landmark Shift in Common Law Jurisprudence**: Hong Kong’s decision **preempted the UK’s legislative response** to *Goodwin* (which led to the *Gender Recognition Act 2004*). The CFA’s ruling was **more progressive than the UK’s own courts** at the time, as the House of Lords in *Bellinger* had only declared the law *incompatible* with the ECHR but left the remedy to Parliament. Hong Kong’s Court of Final Appeal **acted directly to remedy the constitutional violation**.  
3. **The "Intermediate Zone" Metaphor**: The Court adopted the ECtHR’s phrase from *Goodwin*—that denying transsexuals the right to marry condemns them to an "intermediate zone, not quite one gender or the other." This **powerful metaphor** crystallized the human cost of legal exclusion and became a **defining rhetorical device** in the judgment.  
4. **The 12-Month Suspension for Legislative Reform**: The Court’s decision to **suspend the declaration for 12 months** to allow legislative action was a **strategic compromise**—acknowledging the need for systemic solutions (e.g., a gender recognition framework) while immediately granting W the right to marry. This balanced judicial activism with respect for legislative authority.  
5. **The Court’s Deep Engagement with Medical and Psychological Evidence**: The judgment meticulously detailed the **medical process of SRS** (including surgical limitations, hormonal treatments, and psychological impacts), demonstrating a **rare judicial willingness to engage with specialized medical knowledge** to inform legal reasoning. This elevated the case beyond abstract legal theory to a **nuanced understanding of transsexual lived experience**.  
6. **The Dissent’s Social Policy Argument**: Mr. Justice Chan’s dissent, which framed the issue as a **"social policy" matter for the legislature**, highlighted a **fundamental tension between judicial interpretation and democratic governance**. His argument—that courts should not "introduce new social policy"—was **rejected by the majority**, signaling a **shift toward a more rights-centric judicial role** in Hong Kong.  

In sum, *W v. The Registrar of Marriages* is **not only a legal milestone** but also a **human rights triumph** that redefined the intersection of law, medicine, and identity in Hong Kong. Its emphasis on **dignity, evolving societal norms, and constitutional supremacy** sets a precedent for future cases involving marginalized communities. [end of text]
