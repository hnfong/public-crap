### **Question A: Summary of the Bill, Its Purpose, and Major Themes**

#### **Summary**
The *Protection of Critical Infrastructures (Computer Systems) Bill* is a comprehensive legislative framework designed to safeguard Hong Kong’s critical infrastructure computer systems from cyber threats and incidents. It establishes a regulatory regime for identifying, designating, and overseeing organizations operating critical infrastructures—such as energy, banking, telecommunications, healthcare, and transport systems—and imposes strict security obligations on these operators.

The bill creates two tiers of regulatory authorities: the **Commissioner of Critical Infrastructure (Computer-system Security)**, who oversees all critical infrastructures not assigned to a designated authority, and **designated authorities** (e.g., the Monetary Authority, Communications Authority), which regulate specific sectors. These authorities have broad powers to issue codes of practice, require information, issue directions, and conduct investigations.

Key mechanisms include:
- **Designation of CI Operators and Critical Computer Systems** based on their strategic importance.
- **Mandatory obligations** for CI operators, including maintaining a security management unit, submitting security plans, conducting risk assessments and audits, and reporting incidents.
- **Early intervention and investigation powers**, including the ability to enter premises and compel cooperation via warrants or emergency entry.
- **Appeals process** for affected organizations.
- **Strict confidentiality rules**, protection for informers, and immunity for good-faith compliance.

#### **Purpose**
The primary purpose of the bill is to:
1. **Protect the security of computer systems** that underpin essential services in Hong Kong.
2. **Regulate operators** of critical infrastructures to ensure robust cybersecurity practices.
3. **Enable proactive and responsive actions** against cyber threats and incidents through early intervention, investigation, and enforcement.
4. **Ensure accountability, transparency, and legal certainty** in the handling of cybersecurity risks.

#### **Major Themes**
1. **National Security and Resilience**: The bill reflects a strategic focus on protecting Hong Kong’s foundational digital infrastructure from disruption, sabotage, or espionage.
2. **Proactive Risk Management**: Emphasis on preventive measures—risk assessments, audits, security plans—rather than reactive responses.
3. **Centralized Oversight with Sector-Specific Authority**: A dual system where the Commissioner leads overall coordination, while designated authorities manage sector-specific risks.
4. **Enforcement and Compliance**: Strong enforcement tools, including fines, directions, warrants, and prosecution powers.
5. **Balancing Security and Rights**: Includes safeguards like immunity, protection of informers, and due diligence defenses to prevent abuse.
6. **Legal Certainty and Accountability**: Clear definitions, appeal mechanisms, and procedural fairness to ensure legitimacy.

- **Suppliers and service providers** to CI operators (due to audit and investigation requirements).
- **Cybersecurity firms** offering risk assessments, audits, or incident response services.
- **Investors and insurers** assessing risk exposure in critical infrastructure.
- **Public interest groups and civil society** concerned about privacy, transparency, and government overreach.
