### 1. **Summary of the Facts**

The case, *KWOK CHEUK KIN AND ANOTHER v. DIRECTOR OF LANDS AND OTHERS [2021] HKCA 54; CACV 317/2019*, concerns the constitutionality of Hong Kong’s **New Territories Small House Policy (SHP)**, a long-standing administrative policy that grants male indigenous villagers in the New Territories (NTIIs) the right to build a small house on a suitable site within their village once in their lifetime. The policy, introduced in 1972, is inherently discriminatory on grounds of **sex** (only males qualify) and **social origin/birth** (only descendants of male villagers from 1898 are eligible). It operates through three forms of land grants: **free building licence** (on private land), **private treaty grant** (on government land), and **land exchange** (surrender and re-grant).

The applicants, two non-indigenous residents, challenged the SHP in judicial review proceedings, arguing it violates:
- **Article 25** of the Basic Law (right to equality before the law),
- **Article 39** of the Basic Law (right to enjoy rights and freedoms under the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance),
- **Article 22** of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights (prohibition of discrimination),
- And **Article 7** of the Basic Law (duty to manage land for the benefit of all Hong Kong residents).

The lower court (Chow J) ruled that while the SHP was indeed discriminatory and thus unconstitutional under these provisions, it might still be protected under **Article 40 of the Basic Law**, which guarantees the “lawful traditional rights and interests” of NTIIs. The Judge concluded that only the **free building licence** component qualified as a “lawful traditional right” under Article 40, but **private treaty grants and land exchanges did not**, as they failed a “tracing exercise” back to pre-1898 customs. Therefore, the SHP was declared unconstitutional in part.

All parties appealed. The **respondents (Government)** and the **interested party (Heung Yee Kuk)** argued that the **entire SHP**, including private treaty grants and land exchanges, was protected under Article 40. The **applicants** contended that the SHP was not protected because it was discriminatory and not truly “traditional” or “lawful” under the Basic Law.

The Court of Appeal ultimately **allowed the appeals**, **overturned the lower court’s judgment**, and held that the **entire Small House Policy is constitutional** under Article 40, despite its discriminatory nature.

### 2. **Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties**

#### **Applicants’ Arguments (Kwok Cheuk Kin et al.)**
- The SHP is **inherently discriminatory** on grounds of sex and social origin, violating **Articles 25, 39, and 22 of the Basic Law** and the **Hong Kong Bill of Rights**.
- The **“lawful traditional rights and interests”** under Article 40 must be **lawful under the Basic Law and the BOR**, including equality principles. Since the SHP violates these, it cannot be “lawful” under Article 40.
- The **Ding Rights** (the right to apply for a small house) are not genuine “rights” but merely **discretionary government privileges**, not enforceable legal entitlements.
- The **“traditional”** element requires **direct historical continuity** from pre-1898 customs. The SHP, especially private treaty grants and land exchanges, are **modern inventions** with no traceable link to pre-1898 practices.
- The **free building licence** is not truly traditional either — it is a **modern administrative innovation**, not a continuation of pre-1898 customs.
- Even if the SHP were traditional, **discrimination cannot be constitutionally protected** under Article 40. The protection of rights must not override fundamental equality rights.
- The **delay in bringing the case** (47 years after 1972) and **lack of standing** (applicants have no intention to build a house) justify dismissing the claim.

#### **Respondents and Interested Party’s Arguments (Government and Heung Yee Kuk)**
- The **entire SHP**, including **private treaty grants and land exchanges**, is protected under **Article 40** as a **lawful traditional right** of NTIIs.
- The **“traditional”** element does **not require a strict historical tracing** to 1898. Instead, it refers to rights **recognized as traditional and lawful in the legal system at the time of the Basic Law’s drafting (1990)**.
- The SHP **continues a long-standing custom** of allowing NTIIs to build houses on their land, recognized by the Colonial Government since at least 1959 and formalized in 1972.
- The **Joint Declaration (1984)** and **Annex III** explicitly agreed to **preserve small house grants** beyond 1997, including their **discriminatory nature**, showing that the protection of these rights was **intentional and agreed upon** by both the UK and PRC.
- **BL120 and BL122** (which implement Annex III) confirm that **all rights related to small house grants** are protected, including those made after 1997.
- The **CEDAW reservations** by both the UK and PRC **explicitly exempt** the SHP from anti-discrimination obligations, showing that the **discriminatory nature was accepted and protected**.
- The **private treaty grant and land exchange** are **not new inventions** but **evolutions** of earlier practices (e.g., restricted village auctions, private treaty sales), which preserved the **core right** of NTIIs to acquire land at concessionary rates.
- The **free building licence** is not the only form of protection — **all forms are part of the same policy** and should be protected together.
- The **delay and lack of standing** do not justify refusing relief, as the **public interest in legal certainty** and **good administration** outweighs the applicants’ delay.

### 3. **Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) – Detailed and Thorough**

The **ratio decidendi** of *KWOK CHEUK KIN v. Director of Lands* is a **landmark constitutional interpretation** of **Article 40 of the Basic Law**, which protects the “lawful traditional rights and interests” of New Territories Indigenous Inhabitants (NTIIs). The Court of Appeal’s decision is **not merely a reversal of the lower court**, but a **profound re-construction of the constitutional framework** governing the protection of rights in Hong Kong, particularly in the context of **historical, cultural, and political continuity**.

#### **A. The Core Legal Principle: Constitutional Protection of Rights Despite Discrimination**

The most **novel and controversial** legal principle established is that **Article 40 protects rights that are inherently discriminatory**, **even if they violate other constitutional provisions** such as equality rights under **Articles 25, 39, and 22 of the Basic Law** and **Article 22 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights**.

The Court held that **Article 40 operates as a constitutional shield** that **pre-empts** challenges based on equality or non-discrimination. This is not a mere exception — it is a **constitutional override**. The Court reasoned that the **drafters of the Basic Law deliberately intended to protect certain rights of NTIIs**, even if they were discriminatory, because of their **historical, cultural, and political significance**.

> **Key Insight**: The protection under Article 40 is **not conditional** on the right being non-discriminatory. Instead, the **very fact that the right is discriminatory** is **part of the reason** it was protected — because it reflects **historical realities** and **special circumstances** of the New Territories.

This principle is **radically different** from the usual approach in constitutional law, where **equality rights are considered fundamental and non-derogable**. Here, the Court **elevates a specific historical right above general equality principles**, creating a **constitutional hierarchy** where **Article 40 trumps Articles 25, 39, and 22** in cases of conflict.

#### **B. The “Traditional” Element: Not a Historical Tracing Exercise, But a Legal Recognition Test**

The Court **rejected the lower court’s “tracing exercise”** — the idea that a right must be **directly traceable** to pre-1898 customs to qualify as “traditional”.

Instead, the Court held that **“traditional”** under Article 40 means **a right that was recognized as traditional and lawful in the Hong Kong legal system at the time of the Basic Law’s drafting (April 1990)**.

> **Key Principle**: The **focus is not on historical origin**, but on **legal recognition and continuity**. A right is “traditional” if it was **widely accepted, practiced, and legally recognized** in 1990, even if it evolved from earlier customs.

This is a **significant departure** from the lower court’s approach, which required a **strict historical lineage** to 1898. The Court emphasized that **tradition can evolve** without losing its **essential features**. For example, the **right to build a house** on one’s land, though now exercised through **modern administrative mechanisms**, still **retains the core essence** of the pre-1898 custom.

The Court cited **drafting materials** showing that the **Basic Law Drafting Committee** was aware of the SHP’s discriminatory nature but **deliberately chose to protect it** as a “historical problem” or “special circumstance” of the New Territories.

#### **C. The “Lawful” Element: Not a Legal Test, But a Recognition of Legal Status**

The Court **rejected the applicants’ argument** that “lawful” means **lawful under the BOR or the Basic Law**, including equality principles.

Instead, the Court held that **“lawful”** in Article 40 means **lawful under the legal system of Hong Kong as of 1 July 1997**, and **not inconsistent with the Basic Law** — but **not subject to post-1997 constitutional challenges**.

> **Key Principle**: The **lawfulness of the right is determined at the time of the Basic Law’s drafting (1990)**, not at the time of the challenge. Once a right is recognized as lawful in 1990, it remains protected **even if it would be unlawful under later constitutional standards**.

This is **controversial** because it **insulates a discriminatory policy from constitutional scrutiny** simply because it was **not challenged before 1997**. The Court acknowledged that the SHP might have been **unlawful under the BOR** if challenged earlier, but **the lack of challenge and the legal recognition in 1990** made it **“lawful”** for Article 40 purposes.

#### **D. Coherence and Contextual Interpretation: The “Whole Law” Approach**

The Court applied the **coherence principle** — that the Basic Law must be read as a **coherent whole**. It held that **Article 40 must be read in conjunction with Articles 120 and 122**, which implement **Annex III of the Joint Declaration**.

- **Article 120** protects **all rights in relation to leases** granted before 1997.
- **Article 122** specifically protects **small house grants** and **rent concessions** for male descendants of 1898 villagers.

The Court concluded that **if Article 40 did not protect the entire SHP**, then **Articles 120 and 122 would be rendered meaningless**, as they would protect rights that are not constitutionally protected.

> **Key Principle**: **Constitutional interpretation must avoid absurdity**. If one article protects a right, but another denies it, the interpretation must be adjusted to **avoid contradiction**.

This **coherence principle** is **novel in its application** — it uses **international agreements (Joint Declaration)** and **other constitutional provisions** to **interpret and expand** the scope of Article 40.

#### **E. The Role of CEDAW Reservations: A Constitutional Shield Against Discrimination Challenges**

The Court **relied heavily on the CEDAW reservations** made by both the UK and PRC governments.

- The UK reserved the right to **continue applying laws that discriminate against women** in the New Territories.
- The PRC made a **similar reservation**.
- This reservation is **incorporated into Hong Kong law** via **Schedule 5, Part 2 of the Sex Discrimination Ordinance**, which **exempts the SHP from anti-discrimination laws**.

The Court held that **this reservation is a weighty interpretive aid** — it shows that **the discriminatory nature of the SHP was known and accepted** by the international community, and thus **cannot be challenged under the BOR**.

> **Key Principle**: **International law and reservations can shape constitutional interpretation**, especially when they reflect **the political and historical context** of a right.

This is **remarkable** because it **uses international law to justify a domestic discriminatory policy**, which is **unusual in liberal constitutional democracies**.

#### **F. The Nature of the Right: “Ding Rights” as Enforceable Legal Interests**

The Court rejected the applicants’ argument that the SHP is merely **discretionary** and not a **right**.

It held that **the Small House Policy creates a legitimate expectation** — a **legal obligation** on the Government to process applications fairly and consistently.

> **Key Principle**: A **government policy that is consistently applied for decades** creates a **legitimate expectation** that it will continue, and thus **constitutes a “right or interest”** under Article 40.

This is **important** because it **elevates administrative practice into constitutional rights**, even if the policy is not codified in law.

### 4. **Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case**

Several aspects of this case are **striking, unusual, or remarkable**, both legally and politically:

#### **1. The Constitutional Protection of Discrimination**
The most **remarkable** feature is that the **Hong Kong Court of Appeal has constitutionally protected a policy that discriminates on sex and birth** — **not just tolerated it, but declared it immune from constitutional challenge**. This is **rare in modern constitutional law**, where equality is a **core value**. The Court did not say “this is discriminatory but we accept it” — it said **“it is protected by Article 40, so it cannot be challenged at all.”**

#### **2. The Use of the Joint Declaration as a Constitutional Tool**
The Court **used the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration** — a **political agreement** — as a **binding constitutional interpretation tool**. This is **unusual** because international agreements are typically **not directly enforceable** in domestic courts. Yet here, the Court treated **Annex III** as **a constitutional mandate** that **overrides other constitutional rights**.

#### **3. The “Coherence” Principle as a Constitutional Override**
The Court’s use of **coherence** to **override equality rights** is **novel and controversial**. It suggests that **constitutional rights are not absolute**, but must be **balanced against other constitutional provisions** — even if that means **sacrificing equality**.

#### **4. The 47-Year Delay and the Court’s Response**
The applicants waited **47 years** to challenge the SHP — **from 1972 to 2019**. The Court **acknowledged the delay** but **did not dismiss the case**. Instead, it **focused on the legal merits**, showing that **constitutional rights can be protected even after decades of inaction**.

#### **5. The Political Significance**
This case is **not just legal** — it is **political**. It reflects the **complex legacy of colonialism, sovereignty, and identity** in Hong Kong. The Court’s decision **affirms the special status of NTIIs**, reinforcing a **distinct legal and cultural identity** within Hong Kong.

#### **6. The “Ding Rights” as a Cultural Symbol**
The term **“Ding Rights” (丁權)** — literally “male person rights” — is **deeply symbolic**. It reflects a **Confucian, patriarchal tradition** of male lineage and inheritance. The Court’s protection of this right **legitimizes a traditional social structure** in a modern constitutional democracy.

---

### **Conclusion**

*KWOK CHEUK KIN v. Director of Lands* is a **landmark decision** that redefines the **limits of constitutional rights** in Hong Kong. It establishes that **historical, cultural, and political continuity** can **override fundamental equality rights** under the Basic Law. The Court’s **coherent, contextual, and politically sensitive interpretation** of Article 40 sets a **precedent** that may influence future constitutional cases — especially those involving **indigenous rights, historical practices, and international agreements**. It is a **remarkable example of constitutional law navigating the tension between modern values and historical legacy**. [end of text]
