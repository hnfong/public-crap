Okay, let's tackle this case summary. The user provided a detailed legal case from the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal, and they want four specific tasks done. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I need to summarize the facts briefly. The case is Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v Chan Chun Chuen and Another. So, the key points here are about a will dispute after Mrs. Nina Wang's death in 2007. The Foundation is the beneficiary under the 2002 will, and the Applicant (Chan Chun Chuen) claims the 2006 will is valid. The trial judge found the 2006 will was a forgery, and the Court of Appeal upheld that. Now, the Applicant is seeking leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal. The main issues are whether the appeal qualifies for leave as of right under section 22(1)(a) because the value exceeds $1 million, or if it's a matter of public importance under section 22(1)(b).

Wait, the user mentioned summarizing the facts, so I need to make sure I get the key facts straight. The Foundation wanted the 2002 will validated, and the Applicant claimed the 2006 will was valid. The trial judge ruled the 2006 will was a forgery. The Applicant appealed but was unsuccessful. Now he's trying to get leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal. The main arguments are about the value threshold for leave as of right and the discretionary grounds.

Next, the arguments of the two parties. The Applicant argues that the appeal involves a claim to the estate, which is worth over $1 million, so it should qualify for leave as of right. He also cites previous cases like Wang Din Shin and Re Estate of Mui Yim Fong where similar appeals were allowed. The Foundation counters that the claim isn't for a specific property but for a declaration of the will's validity, and the 2006 will's validity isn't absolute because there's an issue about whether it's a partial will. Also, the financial impact isn't immediate since the court would need to determine if it's a partial will or a full will.

Then, the legal principles. The court had to interpret section 22(1)(a) of the Court of Final Appeal Ordinance. The key points are the "as of right" ground requiring a claim to property or proprietary right worth over $1 million, the "immediacy requirement" meaning the financial effect must be immediate, and the discretionary grounds for appeals based on public importance. The court rejected the Applicant's argument because the appeal doesn't meet the immediacy requirement—since the 2006 will's validity would require determining if it's a partial will, the financial value isn't quantifiable immediately. Also, the court upheld the practice of not reviewing concurrent findings of fact unless there's a miscarriage of justice.

Wait, the user wants the ratio decidendi detailed. So I need to focus on the legal reasoning. The court emphasized that the claim must be for a particular property or proprietary right, and the "directly or indirectly" part doesn't override the immediacy requirement. The two previous cases (Wang Din Shin and Mui Yim Fong) were distinguished because in those cases, winning the appeal would immediately entitle the applicant to the entire estate, but here, there's an unresolved issue about the will being partial, so the financial impact isn't immediate. Also, the court rejected the argument about the new evidence (the police statements) because the discrepancies were inconsequential.

For the striking or unusual aspects, the case is notable for the court's comment that the "as of right" appeal should be reconsidered, as all major Commonwealth jurisdictions have abandoned it. Also, the case involves a high-profile estate—Nina Wang was a wealthy businesswoman, and the estate was worth billions. The Applicant's claim was for the entire estate, which is a huge sum. The court's detailed analysis of the police statements and the witness testimony about the "partial will" is another point. The fact that the Applicant tried to use police statements from a different case (a forgery charge against him) to challenge the witness credibility is unusual. Also, the court's emphasis on the "winner takes all" scenario in probate cases is a key point.

Wait, let me check if I missed anything. The court also discussed the practice of not reviewing concurrent findings of fact, which is a significant legal principle. The Applicant tried to argue that the Court of Appeal's judgment wasn't a concurrent finding, but the court rejected that. The new evidence ground was dismissed because the discrepancies in the witness statements were minor and didn't affect the core finding about the will being a partial will.

I need to make sure the summary of legal principles covers the interpretation of section 22(1)(a), the distinction between the two previous cases and the current one, the immediacy requirement, and the concurrent findings practice. The court's reasoning on the "immediacy" is crucial here. The court said that even if the will is valid, the financial benefit isn't immediate because the court would have to determine if it's a partial will, so the value isn't quantifiable right away.

Also, the court's comment at the end about reconsidering the "as of right" appeal is a notable point. They mention that all major Commonwealth jurisdictions have moved away from such appeals, so Hong Kong should too. That's a significant observation about the jurisdiction's legal evolution.

For the striking aspects, the high value of the estate (billions), the fact that the Applicant was trying to overturn a forgery finding with new evidence from a different legal proceeding, and the court's detailed analysis of the witness's statements about the "partial will" are all noteworthy. The case also highlights the importance of the "winner takes all" principle in probate disputes, where the outcome determines the entire estate's distribution.

Wait, let me verify the key legal points. The court held that for the "as of right" ground, the claim must be for a specific property or proprietary right, and the financial impact must be immediate. In this case, the issue of whether the 2006 will is a partial will means the financial impact isn't immediate, so the threshold isn't met. The previous cases (Wang Din Shin and Mui Yim Fong) were different because the appeals would immediately entitle the applicant to the entire estate without further adjudication. Here, there's an unresolved issue (partial vs. full will), so it's not immediate.

Also, the court rejected the argument that the new evidence (police statements) would undermine the witness's credibility. The discrepancies were minor and didn't affect the core finding about the will being a partial will. The court noted that the witness's testimony was corroborated by another attesting witness, Ng Shun Mo.

I should make sure that in the legal principles section, I explain the "immediacy requirement" clearly. The court emphasized that the order sought must have an immediate financial effect, not just a potential future effect. So even if the will is valid, the court would need to resolve the partial will issue first, so the financial benefit isn't immediate.

Another point is the court's stance on relying on Commonwealth cases. The Applicant cited older New Zealand and Australian cases, but the court rejected them because those jurisdictions have moved away from "as of right" appeals. The court stressed that Hong Kong's practice should be based on its own context, not outdated Commonwealth precedents.

For the arguments of the parties, the Applicant's main points were: (1) the estate's value exceeds $1 million, so leave as of right applies; (2) the appeal involves a question of public importance regarding the concurrent findings practice; (3) new evidence shows a miscarriage of justice. The Foundation countered that the claim isn't for property but for a declaration, the financial impact isn't immediate, the concurrent findings were properly made, and the new evidence is irrelevant.

Wait, the user asked for a brief summary of the arguments, so I need to keep that concise. The Applicant's arguments are based on the value threshold and the public importance of the concurrent findings practice. The Foundation's arguments are about the nature of the claim and the immediacy requirement.

Now, putting it all together. Let me check if I have all the tasks covered. The user wants four parts: facts, arguments, legal principles (detailed), and striking aspects.

Wait, the user mentioned "ratio decidendi" which is the legal reasoning that forms the basis of the court's decision. So the key legal principles are the interpretation of section 22(1)(a), the immediacy requirement, the distinction from previous cases, and the concurrent findings practice. The court's reasoning on these points is the ratio decidendi.

I need to make sure that in the legal principles section, I explain each of these points thoroughly. The court's analysis of the "immediacy requirement" is particularly important here. The court says that the value must be clearly quantifiable, and the order must immediately confer the financial benefit. In this case, because the 2006 will's validity depends on whether it's a partial will, the value isn't quantifiable until that issue is resolved. So the appeal doesn't meet the threshold.

Also, the court's distinction between the current case and the previous ones (Wang Din Shin and Mui Yim Fong) is key. In those cases, the appeals would immediately result in the applicant getting the entire estate, but here, there's an additional step needed. So the court says the current case doesn't qualify.

Another point is the court's rejection of the "or otherwise" ground. The Applicant argued that the Court of Appeal's judgment was inadequate, but the court found that the judgment did constitute concurrent findings. The court also dismissed the new evidence ground because the discrepancies were minor.

For the striking aspects, the high-profile nature of the case (Nina Wang was a billionaire), the detailed examination of the "partial will" issue, the use of police statements from a different case, and the court's comment on abolishing the "as of right" appeal are all notable. The court's observation that Hong Kong is the last major jurisdiction still allowing such appeals is a significant point.

Wait, the user mentioned "anything striking, unusual or remarkable." So the fact that the court is considering abolishing the "as of right" appeal, which is a relic from the pre-1997 era when appeals went to the Privy Council, is a big deal. Also, the estate's value being in the billions, and the Applicant's claim being for the entire estate, which is a classic "winner takes all" scenario in probate.

I should also note that the court's detailed analysis of the witness statements and the police records shows how meticulous they were in assessing the new evidence. The Applicant's attempt to use the police statements to undermine the witness's credibility was a key part of his argument, but the court found it irrelevant.

Let me check if I missed any other points. The court also discussed the "directly or indirectly" phrase in section 22(1)(a), but clarified that it doesn't affect the immediacy requirement. So even if the claim is indirect, the financial impact still needs to be immediate.

Okay, I think I have all the elements. Now, I need to structure the answer according to the four tasks. Let me make sure each part is addressed concisely but thoroughly, especially the legal principles which need to be detailed.

Wait, the user said "Be detailed and thorough. There is no word limit. Use multiple paragraphs. If applicable, focus on the points that might be novel or controversial." So for the legal principles, I should elaborate on the interpretation of section 22(1)(a), the immediacy requirement, the distinction from prior cases, and the concurrent findings practice. The novel or controversial points would be the court's strict application of the immediacy requirement, the rejection of relying on older Commonwealth cases, and the court's stance on the "as of right" appeal.

Also, the court's reasoning that the claim isn't for a proprietary right but for a declaration, and how they distinguished the previous cases where the claim was effectively for the estate. The key is whether the order sought would immediately confer the financial benefit. In the prior cases, it did; here, it doesn't because of the partial will issue.

Another controversial point might be the court's dismissal of the new evidence ground. The Applicant argued that the police statements showed the witness was lying, but the court found the discrepancies were minor and didn't affect the core finding. So the court's threshold for new evidence (Ladd v Marshall) was not met, which is a standard test, but the court's application here is notable.

Wait, the Ladd v Marshall requirements are about fresh evidence on appeal. The court says that even if the new evidence were admitted, it wouldn't lead to a miscarriage of justice because the discrepancies were inconsequential. So the court applied the Ladd v Marshall test rigorously.

I think that's all. Now, let me draft the answer following the four tasks.
</think>

### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts  
The case concerns a dispute over the validity of two wills following the death of **Nina Wang**, a billionaire businesswoman, in 2007. The **Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd** (the Foundation), as the beneficiary under **Mrs. Wang’s 2002 will**, sought a court declaration confirming its validity and challenging the authenticity of an **alleged 2006 will** propounded by the **Applicant, Chan Chun Chuen**, who claimed sole entitlement to the entire estate. After a 40-day trial, **Justice Lam** ruled the 2006 will was a **forgery**, and the **Court of Appeal** upheld this finding. The Applicant now seeks **leave to appeal** to the **Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal** (CFA) under **section 22(1) of the Court of Final Appeal Ordinance**, arguing:  
- **As of right** under section 22(1)(a) (claim exceeding $1 million in value);  
- **Discretionary leave** under section 22(1)(b) (question of public importance or "otherwise").  
The Foundation opposed the application, arguing the appeal fails to meet the statutory thresholds. The CFA dismissed the application, holding the appeal did not qualify for leave as of right due to the **lack of immediacy** in financial impact and rejecting all discretionary grounds. The court also **criticized the "as of right" appeal regime** as outdated, urging its abolition.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties  
#### **Applicant’s Arguments**  
1. **As of Right Ground (Section 22(1)(a))**:  
   - The appeal involves a claim to **Mrs. Wang’s estate**, valued at **over $1 million** (in fact, billions).  
   - Cited **Wang Din Shin v Nina Kung** and **Re Estate of Mui Yim Fong** (Court of Appeal decisions), where appeals were granted as of right because winning the appeal would immediately entitle the applicant to the **entire estate** (a "winner-takes-all" scenario).  
   - Argued the 2006 will’s validity, if confirmed, would confer **immediate proprietary rights** to the estate.  

2. **Discretionary Grounds (Section 22(1)(b))**:  
   - **Public Importance**: The appeal raises a question of **great public importance**—whether the CFA should abandon its practice of refusing to review **concurrent findings of fact** (i.e., findings agreed upon by the trial judge and Court of Appeal).  
   - **"Or Otherwise" Ground**: The Court of Appeal’s judgment was **inadequate** and failed to constitute "concurrent findings," thus bypassing the usual restraint on reviewing factual findings.  
   - **New Evidence**: Proposed to introduce **Police statements** (from a separate forgery investigation) to undermine the credibility of **Winfield Wong**, a key attesting witness. The Applicant claimed these statements contradicted Wong’s testimony, suggesting a **miscarriage of justice**.  

#### **Foundation’s Arguments**  
1. **As of Right Ground**:  
   - The appeal is **not a claim to property** but a **declaration of will validity**, which does not satisfy section 22(1)(a).  
   - The **"immediacy requirement"** is unmet: Even if the 2006 will were valid, the court would need to resolve **Issue 9** (whether it was a **partial will** or a full will), making the financial impact **unquantifiable** until that issue is decided.  
   - Distinguished **Wang Din Shin** and **Mui Yim Fong** on the basis that those cases involved **immediate entitlement** to the entire estate, whereas here, the 2006 will’s validity hinges on unresolved issues.  

2. **Discretionary Grounds**:  
   - **Concurrent Findings**: The Court of Appeal’s judgment **did constitute concurrent findings** (it thoroughly reviewed the trial judge’s findings on forgery, witness credibility, and handwriting evidence).  
   - **New Evidence**: The Police statements **did not undermine** Wong’s core testimony about the 2006 will being a **"partial will"** (a critical finding). Discrepancies in witness statements were **inconsequential** (e.g., minor errors in recalling a beneficiary’s name).  
   - **Public Importance**: The practice of refusing to review concurrent findings is **well-established** and **rationally justified** (to prevent litigation attrition and preserve the CFA’s role as a court of law, not fact-finding).  

---

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The case hinges on the **interpretation of section 22(1) of the Court of Final Appeal Ordinance**, particularly the **"as of right" threshold** (section 22(1)(a)) and the **limits of discretionary appeals** (section 22(1)(b)). The CFA’s reasoning is **detailed, nuanced, and precedent-setting**, with several **novel and controversial points**.  

#### **A. The "As of Right" Threshold (Section 22(1)(a))**  
The CFA reaffirmed the **narrow construction** of section 22(1)(a), emphasizing that **only liquidated monetary claims** (or claims to specific property/proprietary rights) exceeding $1 million qualify for leave as of right. Crucially, the court **rejected the Applicant’s reliance on probate-specific arguments** (e.g., the inquisitorial nature of probate proceedings) and **Commonwealth precedents** (e.g., *Re White (No 2)*, *Beard v Perpetual Trustee Co.*), noting that **all major Commonwealth jurisdictions** (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, UK) have **abandoned "as of right" appeals** to their final courts. The court stressed that **Hong Kong’s jurisprudence must be context-specific**, not deferential to outdated Commonwealth practices.  

The **core legal principle** is the **"immediacy requirement"**:  
> *"The order sought in the proposed appeal, if granted, must have the immediate effect of conferring a financial benefit in a clearly quantified sum exceeding $1 million. It is not enough to show that such a financial consequence is a likely eventual result of the appeal."*  

This requirement **overrides the "directly or indirectly" language** in section 22(1)(a). The court clarified that **"directly or indirectly" describes the *nature* of the claim**, not the *timing* of its financial impact. Thus, even if a claim is "indirect" (e.g., a declaration of will validity), it must still satisfy **immediacy**.  

The court **distinguished** *Wang Din Shin* and *Mui Yim Fong* on the basis that **those appeals would have immediately conferred the entire estate** on the applicant, whereas here, **Issue 9** (whether the 2006 will was a partial will) **must be resolved first**. The trial judge identified **nine issues**, with **Issue 9** being **purely a matter of construction** (not authenticity). If the 2006 will were valid, the court would need to determine:  
- Whether it **revoked** the 2002 will or **operated as a codicil** (partial will);  
- If partial, what **portion of the estate** passed to the Applicant.  
Thus, the **financial benefit was unquantifiable** until this issue was resolved, **disqualifying** the appeal from the "as of right" threshold.  

#### **B. The "Concurrent Findings" Practice (Section 22(1)(b))**  
The Applicant challenged the CFA’s **longstanding practice** of refusing to review **concurrent findings of fact** (i.e., findings agreed upon by the trial judge and Court of Appeal). The court **reaffirmed** this practice, citing **Lord Thankerton’s fourth proposition** in *Srimati Bibhabati Devi v. Kumar Ramendra Narayan Roy* (1946):  
> *"Concurrent findings of fact would not be reviewed save in rare and exceptional cases where the appellant can show some miscarriage of justice or violation of some principle of law or procedure."*  

The court **rejected the Applicant’s arguments** on three fronts:  
1. **Policy Justification**: The practice ensures the CFA focuses on **points of law of public importance**, not factual disputes. As **Gleeson CJ** (Australia) noted, **"the more litigation becomes a process of attrition, the greater will be the tendency for the outcome of litigation to depend upon the resources, or financial support, available to litigants."** The CFA’s role is **not to provide a "third opportunity"** to re-litigate facts.  
2. **Rejection of "Inadequate Judgment" Argument**: The Court of Appeal’s judgment **did constitute concurrent findings**—it **"meticulously examined"** the trial judge’s evaluation of evidence (including witness credibility, handwriting analysis, and "inherent probabilities"). The court **rejected the Applicant’s claim** that the judgment failed to address six "inherent improbabilities" against forgery, noting the trial judge **had already considered them** and found them **insufficient to override cogent evidence**.  
3. **New Evidence Ground**: The Applicant sought to introduce **Police statements** (from a separate forgery case) to undermine **Winfield Wong’s testimony**. The court **dismissed this** as **inconsequential**:  
   - The discrepancies (e.g., Wong’s recollection of the beneficiary’s name) were **minor** and **did not affect the core finding** that the 2006 will was a **"partial will"** (which excluded it from being the 2006 will).  
   - Wong’s testimony was **corroborated by Ng Shun Mo**, another attesting witness.  
   - The court emphasized that **Ladd v Marshall** (the test for fresh evidence on appeal) requires a **"reasonable prospect"** of overturning the trial outcome, which was **not met** here.  

#### **C. The "As of Right" Appeal Regime: A Broader Judicial Observation**  
The CFA **explicitly called for reconsideration** of the "as of right" appeal regime, stating:  
> *"The public interest strongly favours a similar course being taken in this jurisdiction."*  
This is **highly significant** because Hong Kong is **one of the last major jurisdictions** (alongside the UK’s Scottish courts) to retain such a regime, which **derives from the pre-1st July 1997 era** (when appeals went to the Privy Council). The court noted that **all major Commonwealth jurisdictions** have **abolished** this right, and **Hong Kong’s retention is anomalous**. This observation, while **not binding** on the appeal, signals a **clear judicial preference** for modernizing the appeals process.  

#### **D. Novel and Controversial Points**  
1. **Immediacy Requirement as a Threshold**: The court **strictly enforced** the immediacy requirement, **rejecting the Applicant’s argument** that the "winner-takes-all" nature of probate disputes satisfied the threshold. This **narrows the scope** of section 22(1)(a) and **prevents probate disputes** from automatically qualifying for leave as of right.  
2. **Rejection of Commonwealth Precedents**: The court **explicitly rejected reliance on older Commonwealth cases** (e.g., *Re White (No 2)*), arguing that **jurisprudential evolution** in other jurisdictions **invalidates their relevance**. This **asserts Hong Kong’s judicial independence** in interpreting its own statutes.  
3. **"Partial Will" as a Critical Fact**: The court **emphasized the centrality** of the "partial will" finding (that the 2006 will was not a full will but a partial one), which **undermined the Applicant’s entire case**. This **highlights the technical precision** required in probate litigation.  
4. **New Evidence Standard**: The court **rigorously applied** the *Ladd v Marshall* test, **rejecting even minor inconsistencies** in witness testimony as insufficient to justify a miscarriage of justice. This **sets a high bar** for fresh evidence on appeal.  

---

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects  
1. **The Estate’s Immense Value**: The **$1 billion+ estate** (Nina Wang’s wealth was tied to the **Chinachem Group**, a major Hong Kong conglomerate) made this a **high-stakes probate dispute**. The Applicant’s claim for the **entire estate** (over $1 million) was **factually correct** but **legally insufficient** due to the **immediacy requirement**.  
2. **The "Partial Will" Twist**: The **core factual dispute** centered on whether the 2006 will was a **"partial will"** (only disposing of a specific gift, not the entire estate). This **technical probate nuance**—which the trial judge found critical—**determined the entire outcome**. The court’s **detailed analysis** of this issue (e.g., the meaning of "residue" in wills) is **unusually meticulous** for a procedural appeal.  
3. **Use of Police Statements from a Separate Case**: The Applicant **sought to introduce evidence** from a **criminal forgery investigation** (involving himself as a suspect) to undermine a **civil probate witness**. This **cross-proceeding tactic** is **rarely seen** in appellate practice and **highlighted the Applicant’s desperation**.  
4. **The Court’s Explicit Call for Reform**: The CFA’s **unambiguous endorsement** of abolishing the "as of right" appeal regime (a **pre-1997 relic**) is **remarkable**. It **signals a shift** toward **modernizing Hong Kong’s appellate system** to align with global trends, **despite the regime’s historical roots**.  
5. **The "Winner-Takes-All" Probate Reality**: The case **exemplifies** the **high-stakes nature of probate disputes**, where **one party’s victory means total exclusion** of the other. The court **acknowledged this reality** (*"a winner takes all situation"*) but **refused to let it override statutory thresholds**.  
6. **The Applicant’s Unsuccessful "Public Importance" Argument**: The Applicant **framed the appeal as a matter of public importance** (challenging the concurrent findings practice), but the court **rejected it as a "thinly veiled attempt"** to **re-litigate facts**. This **underscores the CFA’s reluctance** to entertain appeals that **lack genuine legal significance**.  

In summary, *Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v Chan Chun Chuen* is **notable for its rigorous application of procedural thresholds**, **its rejection of outdated legal precedents**, and **its forward-looking judicial commentary** on the need to modernize Hong Kong’s appeals regime. The case **exemplifies the tension** between **procedural formalism** and **substantive justice** in high-value probate disputes. [end of text]
