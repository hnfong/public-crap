Okay, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want a detailed analysis of a legal case involving contested wills and forgery. The user provided a specific judgment from the Hong Kong Court of Appeal. The tasks are to summarize the facts, arguments, legal principles, and any striking aspects.

First, I need to parse the case details carefully. The case is about a wealthy philanthropist, Nina Wang, who left a will to a charitable foundation but another man contested it, claiming he was her secret lover and that the will was forged. The court found the 2006 will invalid due to forgery. The user might be a law student or a legal professional looking for a clear breakdown of the case for study or reference purposes.

For task 1, summarizing the facts, I should focus on the key elements: Nina Wang's background, the two wills, the relationship with the first defendant, the evidence presented, and the court's findings. The user probably wants a concise yet comprehensive overview without getting lost in minor details.

Task 2 requires summarizing both parties' arguments. The plaintiff's main points are the inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimony and the evidence of forgery. The defendant argues about the relationship's nature and the reliability of handwriting analysis. The user might need to understand the core arguments to grasp the legal issues involved.

Task 3 is about the legal principles. The ratio decidendi here involves the court's discretion in evaluating evidence, the role of expert testimony in handwriting analysis, and the standards for proving forgery. The user might be interested in how the court handled novel aspects like the statistical approach in handwriting comparison, which is crucial for forensic evidence in will contests.

Task 4 asks for striking or unusual aspects. The case's remarkable elements are the scale of the estate, the secretive relationship, the scientific evidence used, and the severe costs awarded. The user might want to highlight these for a presentation or to understand the broader implications beyond just the legal outcome.

Now, considering the user's deeper needs. They might be preparing for a moot court, researching case law on forgery in wills, or analyzing how courts handle evidence of fraud. The detailed focus on handwriting analysis suggests they're interested in forensic methods' admissibility and weight. The mention of costs could indicate interest in how courts penalize bad faith in litigation.

I should ensure that the summary is accurate, especially regarding the expert evidence and the court's reasoning. The user might need to compare this case with others, so highlighting the unique aspects like the statistical approach and the handling of the relationship's secrecy would be important. Also, clarifying the legal standards for cost awards in probate cases could add value.

Need to check if there are any nuances in the case that aren't immediately obvious. For example, the court's emphasis on the witnesses' conduct and the defendant's role in the litigation. The user might benefit from understanding how these factors influenced the decision, especially the moral aspect the defendant tried to argue.

Finally, the conclusion should tie everything together, reinforcing the key legal points and the case's significance. The user likely wants a clear takeaway on how evidence evaluation and cost penalties work in high-stakes probate cases, so emphasizing those aspects in the response is crucial.

Okay, here is the breakdown of the case *Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v. Chan Chun Chuen and Another* [2011] HKCA 13:

**1. Brief Summary of Facts**

The case revolves around a dispute over the validity of two wills executed by the late Nina Wang, a prominent philanthropist. The first will, the 2002 Will, left her entire estate to Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd (the Plaintiff), a foundation she co-established with her late husband, Teddy Wang. It included unusual provisions, such as entrusting the foundation's supervision to the Secretary General of the UN, the PRC Premier, and the Hong Kong Chief Executive, and was validly executed. The second will, the 2006 Will, was allegedly executed shortly after Nina Wang's death from terminal cancer (she died in April 2007). This will named Chan Chun Chuen (the First Defendant) as beneficiary. The First Defendant claimed a long-standing secret relationship with Nina Wang, treating her as his wife, and that she had intended this will for him. The court below found substantial evidence that the First Defendant had forged the 2006 Will, including discrepancies in the witnesses' accounts of the signing, the scientific evidence showing the signature was written over a crease (implying it wasn't folded as claimed during signing), the lack of a forged residue in the will despite Nina Wang's known estate, the absence of a genuine signature from Winfield Wong (one of the witnesses) on the document presented, and the fact that the First Defendant was responsible for the hole-digging activities and payments that occurred around the time of the alleged signing. The appeal court upheld these findings, concluding the 2006 Will was indeed a forgery.

**2. Brief Summary of Arguments**

*   **Plaintiff (Chinachem Charitable Foundation):** Argued that the 2006 Will was a forgery. They presented evidence showing inconsistencies between the witnesses' testimony and the will's contents, the scientific findings regarding the signature and paper folding, the timeline of events (including the resumption of relationship and activities after the Teddy Wang litigation), and the fact that Nina Wang never revoked the 2002 Will or treated the relationship with the First Defendant as superseding it. They emphasized the lack of corroborating evidence for the First Defendant's claims and the suspicious circumstances surrounding the will's execution.
*   **First Defendant (Chan Chun Chuen):** Argued that the 2006 Will was genuine. He claimed a secret, intimate relationship with Nina Wang existed for years, and she had intended the will for him. He challenged the judge's reliance on the 6 "inherent improbabilities," arguing the judge failed to properly evaluate the evidence based on probabilities. He also contested the scientific evidence on handwriting, questioning the methodology and conclusions of the Plaintiff's expert witness (Mr. Radley). Furthermore, he argued the court should not have awarded indemnity costs, claiming the judge's findings were based on prejudice against his relationship with Nina Wang.

**3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

This case established several important legal principles regarding wills, evidence, and costs in Hong Kong:

*   **Burden of Proof and Forged Documents:** The court confirmed that proving a will is forged requires clear and convincing evidence. The judge's meticulous evaluation of conflicting evidence from witnesses (Mr. Wong and Mr. Ng) and the scientific findings (signature simulation, paper folding inconsistency) were central to establishing the forgery. The court emphasized that the judge must consider all relevant evidence, including the conduct of witnesses and the overall circumstances, not just isolated improbabilities.
*   **Discretion in Finding Fact:** The court upheld the judge's exercise of discretion in finding the facts. While the First Defendant argued the judge improperly weighed certain factors (the "inherent improbabilities"), the appeal court found the judge explicitly stated he considered these factors and correctly concluded their weight. This court stated that appellate courts should not interfere with a trial judge's assessment of the weight given to evidence, especially when the judge has carefully considered all submissions and evidence.
*   **Expert Evidence in Handwriting Analysis:** The case involved a detailed examination of the principles and practices of handwriting comparison. The court acknowledged the complexity and potential subjectivity but ultimately upheld the judge's acceptance of the Plaintiff's expert evidence (Mr. Radley). Key points included:
    *   The importance of using an adequate number of comparison samples (specimens) of known authenticity.
    *   The need to exclude inappropriate samples (like severely deteriorated hospital signatures) to avoid skewing the analysis.
    *   The concept of "rarities" and "differences" â€“ the court accepted that features found in a small percentage of genuine samples (rarities) could be indicative of forgery, especially when accumulated. The judge's "no-lose" argument (where large variation makes matching features inconclusive) was rejected by the court, affirming that the presence of unexplained significant divergences or a concentration of rare features supports a forgery finding.
    *   The judge must consider the totality of the evidence, not just the existence of similarities or differences.
*   **Evaluating Witness Credibility and Evidence:** The court highlighted the judge's role in assessing the credibility of witnesses and
