## HKSAR v. Chan Ming Lok – Case Summary

### 1. Facts of the Case

On June 29, 2008, Chan Ming Lok was arrested in a public place in Central, Hong Kong, for possessing a knife. Police officers observed him acting suspiciously – repeatedly looking around and changing direction – while walking through several streets. When questioned, Chan stated he carried the knife for self-defense, as he lived in Shenzhen and feared being robbed during his late-night returns. He claimed he routinely brought the knife across the border, unaware it was illegal. He was convicted by a magistrate of possessing an offensive weapon under Section 33(1) of the Public Order Ordinance and sentenced to 6 months’ imprisonment. The appeal centered on whether the magistrate correctly applied the definition of an “offensive weapon” and whether the sentence was appropriate.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**HKSAR (Respondent):** The prosecution argued that the knife was an offensive weapon, and Chan had no lawful authority or reasonable excuse for possessing it. They emphasized Chan’s admission that he intended the knife to be used as a weapon, even if for self-defense, and that the possibility of injury existed. They conceded, however, that the definition of “offensive weapon” in the Public Order Ordinance, specifically category (c) – “suitable for causing injury to the person” – might be invalid due to a suggestion in a previous Court of Appeal case ( *R v. Chong Ah Choi*) that it conflicted with the Hong Kong Bill of Rights.

**Chan Ming Lok (Appellant):** The defense argued that the magistrate erred in concluding the knife was an offensive weapon based on it being “suitable for causing injury to the person,” given the *Chong Ah Choi* case’s suggestion that this category was incompatible with the Bill of Rights. They contended that if category (c) was invalid, the magistrate’s finding was flawed. They also argued that Chan’s intent was for self-defense in China, not Hong Kong, and therefore didn’t constitute an offense under Hong Kong law.



### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

This case revolves around the interpretation of “offensive weapon” as defined in Section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245) and its compatibility with the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (Cap. 383). The core legal principles established, or clarified, by the judgment are multifaceted and touch upon statutory interpretation, the burden of proof, and the elements of the offense.

**1. The Four Categories of Offensive Weapons & the Impact of *Chong Ah Choi*:** The Public Order Ordinance defines an offensive weapon through four categories: (a) made for causing injury; (b) adapted for causing injury; (c) suitable for causing injury; and (d) intended for causing injury. The case acknowledges the long-standing ambiguity stemming from *R v. Chong Ah Choi*, where Bokhary JA (as he then was) *obiter* suggested that category (c) – “suitable for causing injury” – might be incompatible with the Bill of Rights, which protects against arbitrary interference with privacy and security. The prosecution, remarkably, conceded that category (c) likely *was* invalid. This concession highlights a significant issue: the ordinance hadn’t been amended despite the *Chong Ah Choi* suggestion being over 14 years old, creating a potential “trap for the unwary.”

**2. Statutory Interpretation & the Magistrate’s Findings:** The court found the magistrate’s reasoning regarding the categorization of the knife as an offensive weapon was insufficiently clear. While the magistrate correctly stated the definition of an offensive weapon, her written findings didn’t explicitly state *which* category she relied upon.  The magistrate found the knife wasn’t “made” or “adapted” for causing injury, leaving the possibility that she relied on the “suitable for causing injury” category.  Given the concession regarding category (c)’s potential invalidity, this ambiguity created a basis for appeal. The court emphasized the importance of clear reasoning in judicial decisions, particularly when dealing with criminal offenses.

**3. Intention & the “Intended Use” Category (d):**  Crucially, the court ultimately upheld the conviction *not* based on the potentially flawed “suitability” category, but on the evidence demonstrating Chan’s *intention* to use the knife for injury, even if for self-defense.  The court found that Chan’s admission to police – that he carried the knife to protect himself from robbery – constituted an admission that he intended the knife to be used as a weapon against another person. This falls squarely within category (d) of the ordinance: an article “intended by the person having it with him for use for causing injury to the person.” The court reasoned that the *possibility* of injury, inherent in carrying a knife, was sufficient to establish intent, regardless of whether the intended use was in Hong Kong or mainland China.  The location of the intended use was deemed irrelevant.

**4. Reasonable Excuse & Self-Defense:** The court affirmed that self-defense, without evidence of *imminent* danger, does not constitute a reasonable excuse for possessing an offensive weapon. Chan’s claim of fearing robbery in China was insufficient to justify carrying the knife in Hong Kong. The law requires a genuine and immediate threat to justify possessing a weapon for self-defense.

**5. Appeal on Rehearing & Credibility of Witnesses:** The appeal was heard on the papers (a rehearing based on the record of the lower court), meaning the appellate court relied heavily on the magistrate’s findings of fact, particularly regarding the credibility of the police witnesses. The magistrate had found the police officers to be honest and credible, and their testimony regarding Chan’s admission was pivotal to the court’s decision.

**Novel/Controversial Points:**

*   **The lingering ambiguity of Section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance:** The case highlights the need for legislative reform to clarify the definition of “offensive weapon” and address the concerns raised in *Chong Ah Choi*. The continued existence of a potentially invalid category creates legal uncertainty.
*   **The scope of “intent” in category (d):** The court’s interpretation of “intent” as encompassing the *possibility* of injury, even for self-defense, is potentially broad. It raises questions about how far this intent must be developed to constitute an offense.  A mere hypothetical possibility might be considered too tenuous.
*   **Relevance of intended location of use:** The court’s dismissal of the relevance of the intended location of use (China vs. Hong Kong) is a potentially controversial point. While the law doesn’t explicitly require the threat to be within Hong Kong, some might argue that the justification for prohibiting weapons possession is tied to maintaining public safety *within* Hong Kong’s jurisdiction.



In conclusion, *HKSAR v. Chan Ming Lok* reinforces the principle that possessing an article with the intent to cause injury, even for self-defense, can constitute an offense under the Public Order Ordinance. It also underscores the importance of clear judicial reasoning and the need for legislative clarity in defining criminal offenses, particularly when fundamental rights are implicated. The case serves as a reminder of the seriousness with which Hong Kong law views the carrying of offensive weapons, even in the absence of an immediate threat. [end of text]
