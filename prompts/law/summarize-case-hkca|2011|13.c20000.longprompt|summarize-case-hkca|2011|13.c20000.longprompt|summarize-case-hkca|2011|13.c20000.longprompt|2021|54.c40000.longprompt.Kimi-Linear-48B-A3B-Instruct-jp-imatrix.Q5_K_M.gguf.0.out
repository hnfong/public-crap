### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts

The case **KWOK CHEUK KIN AND ANOTHER v. DIRECTOR OF LANDS AND OTHERS** ([2021] HKCA 54) concerns the constitutionality of the **New Territories Small House Policy** ("Small House Policy"), which grants male indigenous villagers in the New Territories the right to apply for a small house (a subsidized, limited-size dwelling) on government or village land. The applicants, who are not indigenous villagers, challenged the policy on the grounds that it discriminates based on **social origin/birth** and **sex**, violating **Articles 25 and 39 of the Basic Law** and **Article 22 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights**. The respondents and an **interested party** (the Heung Yee Kuk) argued that the policy is protected under **Article 40 of the Basic Law**, which guarantees the protection of "lawful traditional rights and interests" of indigenous inhabitants.

The court had to determine whether the policy, particularly the **right to apply for a small house grant** (referred to as "Ding Rights"), is a **lawful traditional right** protected under Article 40, despite its discriminatory nature. The court also considered whether **private treaty grants** and **land exchanges** under the policy were protected, or only **free building licences**.

### 2. Summary of the Parties' Arguments

#### **Applicants' Arguments:**
- The Small House Policy is **discriminatory** based on **social origin/birth** and **sex**, violating **BL25, BL39, and BOR22**.
- The policy's **Ding Rights** are **not "lawful traditional rights"** under **BL40** because:
  - "Lawful" means **lawful under Hong Kong law post-1997**, and the policy is discriminatory and thus unlawful.
  - "Traditional" means **traceable to pre-1898 customs**, and the Ding Rights are **not traceable** to such customs.
  - The policy is **not a right** but a **discretionary government policy**, not a "right or interest" under BL40.
- The policy **violates BL7** (land management for public benefit).

#### **Respondents' and Interested Party's Arguments:**
- The **entire Small House Policy**, including **private treaty grants and exchanges**, is protected under **BL40** as "lawful traditional rights."
- The policy is **traditional** because it **traceable to pre-1898 customs** of indigenous villagers building houses on their own land.
- The policy is **lawful** because it was **recognized in legislation and government policy** before and after 1997, and **protected by BL120 and BL122** (which preserve pre-1997 land grants).
- The **CEDAW reservations** (allowing continued male-only benefits) support the policy's constitutionality under BL40.
- The applicants **lack standing** and there was **unreasonable delay** in bringing the challenge.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) – Detailed Analysis

#### **A. Construction of BL40 – "Lawful Traditional Rights and Interests"**
The court adopted a **contextual and purposive approach** to interpreting BL40, considering:
- **Historical context**: The policy originated from **pre-1898 customs** of indigenous villagers building houses on their own land, recognized by the colonial government.
- **Continuity**: The policy was **continued post-1997** under **BL120 and BL122**, which protect pre-1997 land grants.
- **Coherence**: BL40 must be read with **BL120, BL122, and BL7** to avoid contradictions. The policy is **protected** under BL40 despite its discriminatory nature, due to **CEDAW reservations** and the **intent to preserve traditional rights**.

#### **B. "Traditional" Rights – No Tracing Exercise Required**
The court **rejected** the **tracing exercise** (whether rights are traceable to pre-1898 customs) as the **correct test** for "traditional" rights under BL40. Instead:
- The **Ding Rights** are **inherently traditional** because they **originated from pre-1898 customs** and were **continued post-1997** under BL40.
- The **Judge's tracing exercise** was **unnecessary** and **misapplied** – the focus should be on **whether the right existed pre-1997**, not whether it matches pre-1898 exact forms.

#### **C. "Lawful" Rights – Presumption of Lawfulness**
The court held that **"lawful" under BL40 means "lawful under Hong Kong law post-1997"**, but with a **presumption of lawfulness** for pre-1997 rights:
- The **Small House Policy was never challenged pre-1997**, and **CEDAW reservations** suggest it was **accepted as lawful**.
- The policy is **protected under BL40**, even if discriminatory, because it was **recognized as traditional and lawful** before 1997.

#### **D. Scope of Protection – Free Building Licence vs. Private Treaty Grants/Exchanges**
The court **distinguished** between forms of small house grants:
- **Free building licences** (nil premium) – **protected** under BL40 as traditional rights.
- **Private treaty grants and exchanges** – **not protected** under BL40 because they **do not trace back to pre-1898 customs** (they were **colonial innovations**).
- However, the **court ultimately held the entire policy constitutional** under BL40, implying that **all forms are protected** due to **BL120, BL122, and CEDAW reservations**.

#### **E. Discrimination and Equality Provisions**
- **BL25, BL39, and BOR22** do **not override BL40** due to **CEDAW reservations** and the **constitutional protection of traditional rights**.
- The **Small House Policy is discriminatory**, but **BL40 shields it** from challenge under equality provisions.

#### **F. Standing and Delay**
- The **applicants lacked standing** because they did not demonstrate a **personal interest** in the policy.
- The **delay in bringing the challenge** was **unreasonable**, causing **prejudice to third parties and undermining good administration**.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

1. **Constitutional Protection for Discriminatory Rights**: The court **upheld a discriminatory policy** (male-only small house grants) under **BL40**, citing **CEDAW reservations** and **historical continuity**. This is **unusual** because constitutional protections typically **prohibit discrimination**, not **protect it**.

2. **Rejection of Tracing Exercise**: The court **rejected the Judge’s tracing exercise**, arguing that **BL40 protects rights existing pre-1997**, not necessarily pre-1898. This is **novel** – most constitutional interpretations focus on **historical continuity**, but here, **BL40’s purpose was to preserve post-1997 rights**, not necessarily pre-1898 ones.

3. **CEDAW Reservations as Constitutional Interpretation Tool**: The court **relied on CEDAW reservations** to **justify discriminatory treatment**, which is **rare** – typically, **international treaties** are used to **challenge** discriminatory laws, not **uphold** them.

4. **Coherence Principle Overriding Equality Rights**: The court **prioritized coherence with BL120, BL122, and CEDAW reservations** over **BL25/39/BOR22**, effectively **constitutionalizing discrimination** to preserve **traditional rights**.

5. **Extraordinary Delay and Standing Issues**: The court **dismissed the case due to delay and lack of standing**, despite the **policy’s long-standing impact** (111,995 applications between 1972-2018). This highlights the **difficulty of challenging entrenched traditional rights**, even when discriminatory.

### **Conclusion**
The case is **remarkable** for **upholding a discriminatory traditional right** under **BL40**, despite **equality guarantees**, due to **CEDAW reservations** and **historical continuity**. The court’s **narrow interpretation of "traditional" rights** (focusing on **pre-1997 existence**, not pre-1898 tracing) and **prioritization of coherence over equality** make it a **landmark decision** in Hong Kong constitutional law.
