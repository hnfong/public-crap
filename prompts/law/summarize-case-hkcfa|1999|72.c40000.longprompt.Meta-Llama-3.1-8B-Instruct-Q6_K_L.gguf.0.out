**Summary of Facts**

The case of Ng Ka Ling and Another v. The Director of Immigration (1999) involves three appeals by Chinese nationals born on the Mainland who claim to be permanent residents of Hong Kong under the Basic Law. The applicants, Miss Ng Ka Ling, Miss Ng Tan Tan, Mr. Tsui Kuen Nang, and Miss Cheung Lai Wah, were born to fathers who were permanent residents of Hong Kong, having resided in the territory for more than seven years. The applicants entered Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, and asserted their right of abode under Article 24(2) of the Basic Law. However, the Director of Immigration refused to recognize their right of abode, citing the Immigration (Amendment) (No. 3) Ordinance (No. 3 Ordinance), which introduced a scheme requiring applicants to hold a one-way permit issued by the Mainland authorities before they could establish their status as permanent residents. The applicants challenged the Director's decision in judicial review proceedings, arguing that the No. 3 Ordinance was unconstitutional and that they had the right of abode under Article 24(3) of the Basic Law.

**Summary of Arguments**

The applicants argued that the No. 3 Ordinance was unconstitutional on several grounds. Firstly, they contended that the Court of Final Appeal had the jurisdiction to interpret the Basic Law and that the No. 3 Ordinance was inconsistent with the Basic Law. Secondly, they argued that Article 22(4) of the Basic Law, which deals with entry into the Region, did not qualify the right of abode in Article 24(3). Thirdly, they contended that the No. 3 Ordinance's retrospective provision, which deemed it to have come into operation on July 1, 1997, was unconstitutional. Fourthly, they argued that para 1(2)(b) of Schedule 1, which excludes children born out of wedlock from qualifying as permanent residents, was unconstitutional. Finally, they contended that the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) was not a legally constituted body and that any legislation passed by it was invalid.

The Director of Immigration, on the other hand, argued that the No. 3 Ordinance was constitutional and that the applicants did not have the right of abode under Article 24(3) of the Basic Law. He contended that the Court of Final Appeal did not have the jurisdiction to interpret the Basic Law and that the No. 3 Ordinance was a valid exercise of the legislative power. He also argued that Article 22(4) of the Basic Law qualified the right of abode in Article 24(3) and that the No. 3 Ordinance was a reasonable measure to implement this provision. Furthermore, he argued that the retrospective provision in the No. 3 Ordinance was constitutional and that para 1(2)(b) of Schedule 1 was a valid provision. Finally, he contended that the PLC was a legally constituted body and that any legislation passed by it was valid.

**Summary of Legal Principles**

The Court of Final Appeal held that the No. 3 Ordinance was unconstitutional to the extent that it required permanent residents of the Region residing on the Mainland to hold a one-way permit before they could enjoy the constitutional right of abode. The court also held that the retrospective provision in the No. 3 Ordinance was unconstitutional. The court further held that para 1(2)(b) of Schedule 1, which excludes children born out of wedlock from qualifying as permanent residents, was unconstitutional.

The court's decision was based on several key legal principles. Firstly, the court held that the Court of Final Appeal had the jurisdiction to interpret the Basic Law and that the No. 3 Ordinance was inconsistent with the Basic Law. This was a novel and controversial point, as the court had to consider the extent of its jurisdiction to interpret the Basic Law and the relationship between the Basic Law and the No. 3 Ordinance.

Secondly, the court held that Article 22(4) of the Basic Law did not qualify the right of abode in Article 24(3). This was a significant point, as it meant that the No. 3 Ordinance's requirement that permanent residents hold a one-way permit before they could enjoy the right of abode was unconstitutional. The court's approach to this issue was to consider the language and purpose of Article 22(4) and Article 24(3) and to conclude that the former did not qualify the latter.

Thirdly, the court held that the retrospective provision in the No. 3 Ordinance was unconstitutional. This was a significant point, as it meant that the provision could not be applied to permanent residents who had already arrived in Hong Kong before July 10, 1997. The court's approach to this issue was to consider the effect of the retrospective provision on the applicants' rights and to conclude that it was unconstitutional.

Fourthly, the court held that para 1(2)(b) of Schedule 1 was unconstitutional. This was a significant point, as it meant that children born out of wedlock could qualify as permanent residents under the third category in Article 24(2). The court's approach to this issue was to consider the language and purpose of the provision and to conclude that it was discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional.

Finally, the court held that the PLC was a legally constituted body and that any legislation passed by it was valid. This was a significant point, as it meant that the No. 3 Ordinance was validly enacted and that the applicants' challenges to it were unsuccessful.

In conclusion, the Court of Final Appeal's decision in Ng Ka Ling and Another v. The Director of Immigration (1999) was a significant and far-reaching one, as it established several key legal principles that will have a lasting impact on the interpretation and application of the Basic Law. The decision highlighted the importance of the Court of Final Appeal's jurisdiction to interpret the Basic Law and the need for the court to consider the language and purpose of the Basic Law when interpreting its provisions. The decision also highlighted the importance of the principle of equality and the need for the court to consider the impact of legislation on the rights of individuals. Finally, the decision established that the PLC was a legally constituted body and that any legislation passed by it was valid, which will have significant implications for the future of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
