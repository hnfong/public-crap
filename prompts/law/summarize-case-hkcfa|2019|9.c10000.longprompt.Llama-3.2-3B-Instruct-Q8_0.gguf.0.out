**Facts of the Case**

The case involves four primary school teachers who were charged with obtaining access to a computer with a view to dishonest gain for another under Section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200) of Hong Kong. The teachers, who were briefed on the day before the interview, used their phones and a computer to transmit questions to third parties, which were later used in competitive admission interviews. The questions were obtained from a plastic folder containing the interview questions and the marking scheme. The teachers were acquitted of the charges by the Permanent Magistrate, but the Secretary for Justice appealed to the Court of First Instance, which also acquitted them. The Secretary for Justice then applied to the Court of Final Appeal to review the decision.

**Arguments of the Two Parties**

The Secretary for Justice argued that the use of a computer by a person to obtain access to another's computer, even if it is their own, constitutes the actus reus of the offence under Section 161(1)(c). The Secretary for Justice relied on the ordinary meaning of the words "obtain" and "access" in the statute, which they argued would cover the use of one's own computer. They also argued that the purpose of the provision was to create a new offence of "dishonest accessing" to make it unlawful to gain access to computers with intent to deceive, cause loss to another, or gain for the offender.

The respondents, on the other hand, argued that the use of their own computer does not constitute the actus reus of the offence under Section 161(1)(c). They relied on the legislative history of the provision, which they argued suggests that the offence only applies to unauthorized access to a computer belonging to someone else. They also argued that the purpose of the provision was to create a new offence of "dishonest accessing" to make it unlawful to gain access to computers with intent to deceive, cause loss to another, or gain for the offender, and that the use of one's own computer does not fall within this scope.

**Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The Court of Final Appeal held that the actus reus of the offence under Section 161(1)(c) is not restricted to the unauthorized extraction and use of information from a computer. The court relied on the ordinary meaning of the words "obtain" and "access" in the statute, which they argued would cover the use of one's own computer. The court also relied on the legislative history of the provision, which they argued suggests that the offence only applies to unauthorized access to a computer belonging to someone else.

The court rejected the Secretary for Justice's argument that the use of a computer by a person to obtain access to another's computer, even if it is their own, constitutes the actus reus of the offence under Section 161(1)(c). The court held that the purpose of the provision was to create a new offence of "dishonest accessing" to make it unlawful to gain access to computers with intent to deceive, cause loss to another, or gain for the offender, and that the use of one's own computer does not fall within this scope.

The court also rejected the argument that the use of one's own computer is not covered by the provision because it does not involve unauthorized access to a computer belonging to someone else. The court held that the use of one's own computer can be considered as "access" to a computer, and that the provision should be interpreted in a way that is consistent with its purpose and legislative history.

The court's decision is significant because it establishes that the use of one's own computer does not constitute the actus reus of the offence under Section 161(1)(c), and that the provision should be interpreted in a way that is consistent with its purpose and legislative history. This decision may have implications for the interpretation of similar provisions in other jurisdictions.

The court's decision also highlights the importance of considering the legislative history and purpose of a provision when interpreting a statute. The court's reliance on the legislative history and purpose of the provision suggests that the court is committed to interpreting the statute in a way that is consistent with its original intent, rather than simply relying on a narrow or technical interpretation.

Overall, the Court of Final Appeal's decision in this case demonstrates the importance of careful consideration of the legislative history and purpose of a provision when interpreting a statute, and the need to balance the need for clarity and precision with the need to ensure that the interpretation is consistent with the original intent of the legislature.
