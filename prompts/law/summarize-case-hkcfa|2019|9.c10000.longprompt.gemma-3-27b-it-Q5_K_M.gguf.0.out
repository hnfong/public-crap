## Secretary for Justice v. Cheng Ka Yee and 3 Others – Case Summary

### 1. Facts of the Case

Four individuals – three primary school teachers and a friend – were charged under section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200) for obtaining access to a computer with a view to dishonest gain. The charges stemmed from their actions in transmitting interview questions for a competitive school admission process to third parties. Specifically, the teachers photographed the questions on their phones and/or typed them into a computer, then shared them via WhatsApp and email. The respondents were acquitted by a magistrate who doubted the teachers understood the questions were confidential and questioned whether the necessary element of dishonesty was present. The Secretary for Justice appealed the acquittal, arguing the actus reus of the offence was met by the respondents’ actions. The core issue before the Court of Final Appeal was whether using one’s *own* computer could constitute the offence of “obtaining access to a computer” under the relevant section of the Crimes Ordinance.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**Secretary for Justice (Appellant):** The appellant argued that the offence under s 161(1)(c) was broadly worded and should be interpreted to cover any use of a computer with dishonest intent, regardless of whether the computer belonged to the accused. They contended that smartphones are computers, and using them to photograph, transmit, or create copies of the interview questions constituted “obtaining access” for dishonest gain. The appellant emphasized the evolving nature of technology and the need for a broad interpretation to address modern forms of computer-related crime, citing examples like phishing, hacking, and online fraud. They argued that a narrow interpretation would create legal loopholes and undermine the purpose of the legislation. They pointed to cases where s 161 had been applied to uses of private email accounts and mobile phones.

**Respondents (Cheng Ka Yee & Others):** The respondents argued that the offence required unauthorized access to a computer, and using one’s own device could not be considered unauthorized access. They emphasized the ordinary meaning of “obtain access” implies gaining entry to something one did not previously have access to. They argued that the legislative history of the ordinance, particularly the amendments made during its enactment, suggested a focus on unauthorized access to *other people’s* computers. They contended that a broad interpretation would criminalize commonplace activities and potentially capture innocent behavior.



### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The central legal principle established in *Secretary for Justice v. Cheng Ka Yee* is that **section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200) does not apply to the use of one’s own computer with the requisite dishonest intent, unless that use involves accessing another person’s computer.** This ruling clarifies the scope of the *actus reus* of the offence, specifically the meaning of “obtaining access to a computer.”

The Court’s reasoning is multifaceted and rests on a careful analysis of the statutory text, its context, legislative history, and purpose.  Here’s a detailed breakdown:

**1. Statutory Interpretation – The Ordinary Meaning of “Obtain Access”:** The Court began with the plain meaning of the words “obtain access.” It found that the ordinary understanding of “obtain” implies acquiring access to something *not previously possessed*. Using one’s own computer does not fit this definition, as the user already has access.  The Court noted the redundancy inherent in the phrase “obtain access” when “access” is already used as a noun, further suggesting the section wasn’t intended to cover all computer use, but rather a specific type of access.

**2. Legislative History & Context:** The Court meticulously examined the legislative history surrounding the enactment of s 161 in 1993.  It highlighted that the ordinance was intended to address the emerging problem of *unauthorized* access to computers, particularly in the context of data theft and fraud. The amendments made to other statutes at the same time (Telecommunications Ordinance, Theft Ordinance) consistently focused on unauthorized access to *other people’s* systems.  The Court noted the deletion of a proposed interpretive provision that would have defined “access” as simply “causing a computer to perform any function,” suggesting a deliberate choice *not* to broaden the scope of the offence to encompass all computer use. The initial focus on “dishonest accessing” as a preparatory offence, as reflected in early drafts, further reinforced the idea that the section was intended to address unauthorized intrusion into computer systems.

**3. Purpose of the Legislation:** The Court determined that the primary purpose of s 161 was to criminalize preparatory acts leading to computer-related crimes, specifically those involving unauthorized access and the potential for deception or gain. It wasn’t intended to create a broad prohibition on all dishonest uses of computers. The Court recognized that while technology has evolved, the fundamental principle of requiring unauthorized access remains relevant to the core purpose of the legislation.

**4. Rejection of Broad Interpretation & Policy Concerns:** The Court explicitly rejected the appellant’s argument for a broad interpretation based on modern technological advancements and the need to address new forms of cybercrime. While acknowledging the validity of those concerns, the Court emphasized that statutory interpretation must be grounded in the text and legislative intent, not simply driven by policy considerations.  The Court feared that a broad interpretation would criminalize commonplace activities and potentially capture innocent behavior, leading to an overly expansive and potentially unjust application of the law.  The Court also noted that other existing offences (e.g., fraud, theft) were already capable of addressing many of the scenarios presented by the appellant.
