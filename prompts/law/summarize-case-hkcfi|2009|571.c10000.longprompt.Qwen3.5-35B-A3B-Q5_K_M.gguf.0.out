### 1. Summary of Facts

The appellant, Chan Ming Lok, was convicted of possessing an offensive weapon (a knife) in a public place in Hong Kong, contrary to section 33(1) of the Public Order Ordinance. On the night of June 29, 2008, police officers observed the appellant acting suspiciously in the late hours (around 1:45 a.m.) in the Central district. He was seen walking slowly, looking around at street junctions, and carrying a rucksack which he held in a manner suggesting he was guarding its contents. Upon interception, the appellant admitted to carrying a knife. He explained that he lived in Shenzhen, worked as a chef, and carried the knife for self-defense because he feared robbery in the Mainland where "public order was bad." He claimed he did not know it was illegal to bring the knife into Hong Kong and had done so previously through Customs. The magistrate found the knife to be an offensive weapon and rejected the appellant's claim of self-defense as a "reasonable excuse" due to the lack of imminent danger. The appellant was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. He appealed both his conviction and the sentence.

### 2. Summary of Arguments

**Appellant's Arguments:**
*   **Definition of Offensive Weapon:** The appellant argued that the magistrate erred in law by classifying the knife as an offensive weapon under the category of an article "suitable for causing injury to the person." Relying on obiter comments in *R v. Chong Ah Choi & Others* [1994], the appellant contended that this category should be read down or repealed to comply with the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance.
*   **Magistrate's Findings:** The appellant argued that the magistrate's written findings were ambiguous. Since the magistrate explicitly stated the knife was not "made" or "adapted" for injury, and did not explicitly state the appellant's *intention* to use it for injury in Hong Kong, the conviction must have been based on the "suitable" category, which the appellant argued was legally invalid.
*   **Sentencing:** The appellant argued that the six-month sentence was manifestly excessive given his lack of prior criminal record, the domestic nature of the knife, and the fact that his intent was purely defensive in the Mainland, not offensive in Hong Kong.

**Respondent's (HKSAR) Arguments:**
*   **Admission of Intention:** The respondent conceded that the "suitable" category might no longer be valid following *Chong Ah Choi*, but argued that the magistrate's findings could be interpreted as finding the knife fell under the fourth category: an article "intended by the person... for use for causing injury."
*   **Appellant's Admission:** The respondent emphasized that the appellant explicitly admitted to carrying the knife to "protect himself" and "use it against another person" if robbed. This admission satisfied the requirement of "intention" under the fourth category, regardless of whether the intended use was in Hong Kong or the Mainland.
*   **No Reasonable Excuse:** The respondent argued that self-defense against a hypothetical future threat in the Mainland does not constitute a "reasonable excuse" for carrying a weapon in a public place in Hong Kong, especially absent imminent danger.
*   **Sentencing:** The respondent maintained that the six-month sentence was appropriate given the seriousness of carrying weapons in public.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**The Validity of the "Suitable" Category and the Bill of Rights**
A central legal principle emerging from this case concerns the interpretation of "offensive weapon" under section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245) in light of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (Cap. 383). The Ordinance defines an offensive weapon in four categories: (a) made for injury, (b) adapted for injury, (c) suitable for injury, and (d) intended for injury. The Court acknowledged the obiter dicta in *R v. Chong Ah Choi & Others* [1994], where the Court of Appeal suggested that category (c) ("suitable for causing injury") might be inconsistent with the right to liberty and security of the person under the Bill of Rights. Consequently, the Court accepted the prosecution's concession that category (c) should no longer be relied upon. This creates a significant legal reality: for an article to be an offensive weapon, it must either be inherently dangerous (made/adapted) or the possessor must have the specific *intention* to use it for injury. The Court noted with surprise that the statute had not been amended to reflect this judicial interpretation, leaving a "trap to the unwary" where the statutory text remains unchanged despite the legal reality.

**The Requirement of "Intention" and the Scope of Self-Defense**
The case establishes a crucial principle regarding the "intention" element of offensive weapon possession. The Court held that an individual's admission that they carry a weapon for self-defense constitutes a clear intention to use that weapon to cause injury to another person, even if the context is defensive. The Court reasoned that by carrying a knife with the specific purpose of using it against a potential attacker, the appellant satisfied the fourth category of the definition ("intended by the person... for use for causing injury"). The Court explicitly rejected the argument that the intended location of the use mattered. The appellant's plan to use the knife in the Mainland (Shenzhen) rather than Hong Kong was deemed irrelevant; the act of carrying the weapon with the *intent* to cause injury (even in self-defense) is sufficient to constitute the offense. The Court clarified that self-defense is not a "reasonable excuse" for possession unless there is evidence of *imminent* danger. Since the appellant was merely anticipating a potential robbery in the future, the defense of self-defense failed to provide a lawful excuse.

**The Standard of Review and Ambiguity in Magistrate's Findings**
The Court addressed the procedural principle of how to handle a conviction where the magistrate's findings are ambiguous regarding the specific legal category relied upon. The magistrate had found the knife was not "made" or "adapted" for injury but failed to explicitly state whether she found the appellant "intended" to use it for injury. The Court applied the principle that an appellate court must determine if the conviction can stand despite the ambiguity. The Court reasoned that because the appellant had made a voluntary admission to the police that he carried the knife to "protect himself" (i.e., to use against others), the evidence was sufficient to support a finding of "intention" under the fourth category. Therefore, even if the magistrate had mistakenly relied on the invalid "suitable" category, the conviction could be upheld because the evidence clearly supported the valid "intention" category. This demonstrates that a conviction will stand if the evidence, viewed in the light of the correct legal principles, is sufficient to sustain the verdict, even if the lower court's reasoning was technically flawed or incomplete.

**Sentencing Principles for Self-Defense Possession**
Regarding sentencing, the Court established that while the carrying of offensive weapons is viewed very seriously by the law to ensure public safety, the specific *motive* of the offender is a relevant mitigating factor. The Court distinguished between carrying a weapon for offensive purposes (e.g., to attack) and carrying it for defensive purposes (e.g., self-defense). While the latter does not excuse the offense, it is a factor that can justify a reduction in the severity of the sentence. The Court noted that the appellant had no prior record, the knife was a small domestic item, and there was no evidence of aggressive behavior or intent to harm anyone in Hong Kong. Consequently, the Court exercised its discretion to reduce the sentence from six months to four months, balancing the need for deterrence with the specific circumstances of the appellant's defensive intent.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

One of the most striking aspects of this case is the **statutory lag between judicial interpretation and legislative text**. The Court of Appeal had suggested in 1994 (15 years prior to this judgment) that the "suitable for causing injury" category of the Public Order Ordinance might be unconstitutional under the Bill of Rights. Yet, in 2009, the statute remained unchanged. The presiding judge explicitly criticized this situation, calling the unamended statute a "trap to the unwary." It is remarkable that a law could remain on the books in a form that the courts have effectively rendered partially inoperative for over a decade without the legislature taking action to amend it.

Another unusual element is the **geographical irrelevance of the intended crime**. The appellant's defense hinged on the fact that he intended to use the knife in Shenzhen, China, not in Hong Kong. The Court's dismissal of this distinction is legally significant but practically unusual. It establishes that the "intent" to use a weapon for injury is a state of mind that attaches to the possession itself, regardless of where the user plans to execute that intent. The law treats the possession of the weapon with the *intent* to injure as the completed offense, even if the "injury" was only ever planned to occur across a border.

Finally, the **ambiguity of the magistrate's reasoning** serves as a cautionary tale. The magistrate wrote her findings with "exemplary clarity" in most areas but failed to specify which of the four legal categories she was applying to the knife. Despite this significant omission, the conviction was upheld. This highlights the resilience of the appellate process in Hong Kong, where the court is willing to "read down" or reinterpret a flawed judgment to find a valid legal basis for the conviction if the evidence on record is overwhelming, rather than ordering a retrial for a technical error in the lower court's reasoning.
