Got it, let's tackle this case summary step by step. First, I need to remember the user's tasks: facts, parties' arguments, legal principles (ratio), and something striking. 

Starting with the facts. The case is about a probate dispute over Nina Wang's wills. She had a 2002 will leaving her estate to the Chinachem Charitable Foundation (plaintiff) and a 2006 will produced by the first defendant (Chan Chun Chuen) leaving everything to him. The key issues were the validity of the 2006 will—specifically whether it was forged. 

Nina Wang was a wealthy businesswoman, widow of Teddy Wang. She had a long relationship with Chan, who was a feng shui master. Chan claimed they were lovers, she gave him large sums, and the 2006 will was her last wish. But the plaintiff argued the 2006 will was forged. The trial judge found Chan untrustworthy, the 2006 will was a forgery because the attesting witnesses (Wong and Ng) said they witnessed a partial will (giving $10m to Chan, not the whole estate), and scientific evidence showed Nina's and Wong's signatures were forgeries.

Next, parties' arguments. The plaintiff (foundation) sought to validate the 2002 will and invalidate the 2006 will, claiming forgery. They relied on witness testimony that the 2006 will wasn't what was signed, scientific evidence of forged signatures, and Chan's untrustworthiness (lies about education, secret relationship, large gifts). The first defendant (Chan) argued the 2006 will was genuine: he and Nina were lovers, she made it to leave him everything, the witnesses misremembered, and the scientific evidence was flawed. He also criticized the judge for not considering "inherent probabilities" (supposed deep love) and claimed the judge was biased against his relationship.

Legal principles: The main ratio is about proving forgery in wills, which requires showing the signature/will isn't genuine, often through witness testimony and expert evidence. Key points here: (1) Weight of witness evidence: The court thoroughly analyzed the attesting witnesses' testimony, finding their consistent account (partial will vs. full 2006 will) credible, especially since Chan's version was inconsistent and contradicted by evidence (e.g., folded paper with signature over crease). (2) Expert handwriting analysis: The judge accepted the plaintiff's expert that Nina's and Wong's signatures were highly skilled simulations, rejecting the defendant's expert who relied on inappropriate "deteriorated" hospital signatures (which the judge found distorted the range of variation). (3) Forgery as abuse of process: The court emphasized that knowingly presenting a forged will is an egregious abuse, justifying indemnity costs. (4) Inherent probabilities: The judge did consider "inherent improbabilities" (e.g., Chan's lies about education, secret relationship, sudden full estate bequest), but the defendant argued the judge didn't weigh them enough—court held the judge properly considered them, and weight of probabilities is for the trial judge, not appellate court. (5) Credibility of the testator's intent: The 2002 will was valid and consistent with Nina's long-standing charitable intent; the 2006 will's sudden deviation (leaving everything to a married lover) was inherently improbable without credible evidence.

Striking/remarkable things: (1) The scale of the estate—estimated $100 billion, one of the largest probate disputes in Hong Kong history. (2) The defendant's repeated dishonesty: lying about his education (Georgetown/U Canada), lying about the nature of his relationship with Nina (framing it as loving vs. secret/feng shui-based), lying about the will's execution. (3) The "feng shui will" angle: The defendant claimed the 2006 will was part of feng shui rituals to cure Nina's cancer, but the court suggested the witnessed document might have been a feng shui ritual document, not a legal will. (4) The judge's strong condemnation: Called Chan "untrustworthy and a liar," found he abused the court by presenting a forged will. (5) Indemnity costs: The court ordered indemnity costs (not standard party-party) because of the defendant's deliberate forgery and abuse of process, which is unusual but justified here.

Need to make sure each section is clear: facts are concise, parties' arguments are balanced, legal principles are detailed (focus on novel/controversial, like expert evidence on deteriorated signatures, weight of witness testimony vs. inherent probabilities, forgery as abuse), and striking points are distinct (not just legal, like the estate value, defendant's lies).</seed:think>### 1. Brief Summary of Facts  
The case involved a fierce probate dispute over the estate of Nina Wang, the chairwoman of the Chinachem Group (valued at ~$100 billion). Nina Wang executed a valid 2002 will leaving her entire estate to the **Chinachem Charitable Foundation** (plaintiff). After her death in 2007, the first defendant, **Chan Chun Chuen** (a feng shui master with whom Nina had a long-term secret relationship), produced a 2006 will purporting to leave her entire estate to him.  

Key facts:  
- Nina and Chan had a clandestine relationship (he was married with children) from 1992, with Nina giving him over $720 million in gifts and investments.  
- The 2006 will’s attesting witnesses (solicitor Winfield Wong and Chinachem employee Ng Shung Mo) testified they witnessed a **partial will** (bequeathing $10 million to Chan, not the entire estate) on October 16, 2006—not the full 2006 will.  
- Scientific evidence showed Nina’s and Wong’s signatures on the 2006 will were “highly skilled simulations” (forgeries).  
- Chan lied about material details: falsely claiming a Canadian university education, misleadingly framing his relationship with Nina as loving (not transactional/feng shui-based), and hiding the will until after Nina’s death.  

The trial judge found the 2006 will was a forgery and validated the 2002 will. Chan appealed, but the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, condemning his conduct as an “abuse of process.”


### 2. Arguments of the Two Parties  
**Plaintiff (Chinachem Charitable Foundation):**  
- The 2006 will is a forgery. Attesting witnesses Wong and Ng consistently testified they signed a *partial will* (not the full 2006 will), which was confirmed by Wong’s contemporaneous statements and Ng’s evidence about the document being folded (not creased) when signed (contradicting the 2006 will’s creased signature).  
- Scientific expert evidence proved Nina’s and Wong’s signatures on the 2006 will were simulated, not genuine.  
- Chan was untrustworthy: his lies about education, relationship with Nina, and the will’s execution undermined his credibility.  
- The 2002 will was consistent with Nina’s long-standing charitable intent (she donated to the foundation for decades and appointed relatives to its board weeks before dying).  

**First Defendant (Chan Chun Chuen):**  
- The 2006 will was genuine: he and Nina were “deeply in love,” and she intended to leave him her entire estate to reward his loyalty and feng shui services (including digging holes to locate Teddy Wang and cure her cancer).  
- The witnesses misremembered: Wong and Ng confused the partial will with the full 2006 will, and their testimony was influenced by the plaintiff’s lawyers.  
- The scientific evidence was flawed: his expert (Mr. Westwood) argued the signatures were genuine, relying on “deteriorated hospital signatures” (from Nina’s cancer treatment) to expand the range of her normal handwriting variation.  
- The judge erred by ignoring “inherent probabilities” (e.g., Nina’s supposed love for Chan justifying the full bequest) and was biased against his relationship with Nina.  


### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The case clarified key principles in probate litigation, particularly regarding will forgery, witness credibility, expert evidence, and abuse of process:  

#### a. **Forgery of a Will: Burden of Proof and Witness Testimony**  
To invalidate a will, the plaintiff must prove it was forged—here, through the *consistent, credible testimony of attesting witnesses*. The court held that Wong and Ng’s accounts (they signed a partial will, not the full 2006 will) were far more reliable than Chan’s contradictory claims. Critical factors included:  
- **Contemporaneous statements**: Wong’s April 7, 2007 statement (made days after Nina’s death) explicitly noted he witnessed a “partial will,” which aligned with Ng’s testimony about Nina later saying, “Don’t bother so much—I am fine.”  
- **Physical evidence**: The 2006 will’s signature was written over a crease, but Ng testified the document was *folded (not creased)* when he signed it—consistent with scientific findings that creases would not have been visible to the naked eye at the time.  

The court emphasized that trial judges are entitled to prioritize witness credibility, even if defendants argue the judge “underweighted” supposed “inherent probabilities” (e.g., Nina’s love for Chan). The appellate court deferred to the trial judge’s assessment of witness reliability, as credibility is a “matter essentially for the judge to decide.”


#### b. **Expert Handwriting Evidence: Relevance of “Deteriorated Signatures”**  
The case clarified how courts evaluate expert handwriting analysis, particularly when defendants rely on “atypical” signatures (e.g., those from hospital records of a terminally ill person):  
- **Plaintiff’s expert (Mr. Radley)** was credible: He excluded Nina’s “deteriorated hospital signatures” (written during cancer treatment, with poor pen control) from his comparison sample, arguing they distorted the “range of variation” in her normal handwriting.  
- **Defendant’s expert (Mr. Westwood)** was rejected: He included these deteriorated signatures, which the judge found “inappropriate” because they reflected Nina’s medical decline, not her typical writing. The court held that “comparing like with like” is a cardinal principle—expert testimony based on atypical samples cannot justify a conclusion of genuineness.  

The court also validated the “statistical point” in handwriting analysis: an accumulation of rare/accidental features in a questioned signature (e.g., 17 rare features in Nina’s signature) makes forgery far more likely than genuine authorship, even if individual features occasionally appear in genuine samples.


#### c. **Abuse of Process: Forgery as a Ground for Indemnity Costs**  
The court ruled that knowingly presenting a forged will constitutes an “egregious abuse of the process of the court,” justifying **indemnity costs** (not standard party-party costs). This is unusual but justified here because:  
- Chan persisted in pursuing a “thoroughly dishonest case” despite overwhelming evidence against him.  
- The forgery was not a mere technicality—it sought to steal a $100 billion estate, undermining the integrity of probate proceedings.  

The judge also ordered the plaintiff’s costs for expert witnesses on testamentary capacity to be paid from the estate (not Chan), as those issues were unnecessary due to Chan’s own misconduct.


#### d. **Inherent Probabilities: Role in Trial Judges’ Fact-Finding**  
Chan argued the judge failed to consider “inherent probabilities” (e.g., Nina’s supposed love for him justifying the 2006 will). The court rejected this, holding that:  
- “Inherent improbabilities” (e.g., Chan’s lies about education, secret relationship, and sudden $100 billion bequest) *were* considered by the judge—but weightening them is a trial judge’s discretion, not an appellate function.  
- The judge properly rejected Chan’s claim that the 2002 will was a “charity charade” to secure litigation support: Nina’s charitable donations predated the Teddy Wang will litigation and continued afterward, confirming her genuine intent.  


### 4. Striking/Unusual Remarks  
- **Scale of the Estate**: The $100 billion estate made this one of Hong Kong’s largest probate disputes, with global media attention.  
- **Defendant’s Repeated Dishonesty**: Chan lied about his education (falsely claiming a Canadian biology degree), the nature of his relationship with Nina (framing it as loving vs. transactional), and the will’s execution—so consistently that the judge called him “untrustworthy and a liar” multiple times.  
- **“Feng Shui Will” Allegation**: The court suggested the document Wong and Ng witnessed might have been a **feng shui ritual document** (not a legal will), tied to Nina’s cancer treatment (e.g., hole-digging at Chinachem sites correlated with her declining health and payments to Chan).  
- **Indemnity Costs Order**: The court’s decision to award indemnity costs (not standard) was extraordinary, reflecting the severity of Chan’s abuse of process.  
- **Secret Relationship Dynamics**: Nina’s willingness to give Chan hundreds of millions while keeping their relationship hidden (even from her own family) highlighted the complexity of high-net-worth individuals’ personal and financial lives. [end of text]
