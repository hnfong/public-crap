### 1. Brief Summary of Facts

The appellant, SO Ping Chi, was the General Manager and Principal Surveyor of Ships of the Local Vessel Safety Branch (LVSB) of the Marine Department in Hong Kong. Between 16 April 2007 and 4 March 2013, he issued an instruction to his subordinates not to enforce the provisions of the Merchant Shipping (Local Vessels) (Safety and Survey) Regulation, Cap 548G ("Cap 548G"), specifically Section 32(2)(b) and Parts 1 and 2 of Schedule 3, which required vessels to carry children's lifejackets. The instruction was that these requirements only applied to "new vessels" (licensed after 2 January 2007) and not to "old vessels" (licensed before that date). This practice continued for over three years until it was rescinded after a fatal ferry collision in October 2012. The appellant was convicted of misconduct in public office and sentenced to 16 months' imprisonment. He appealed against both conviction and sentence.

### 2. Summary of Arguments

**Prosecution:**
- The appellant deliberately issued a non-enforcement instruction, wilfully misconducting himself by directing subordinates to ignore statutory safety requirements.
- The instruction was serious misconduct as it was a deliberate departure from legislative intent, affecting public safety and eroding public trust.
- There was no reasonable excuse for the conduct; the appellant did not consult superiors or seek legal advice, and his justification (appeasing industry representatives) was not valid.
- The judge correctly found the conduct wilful, serious, and deserving of criminal sanction.

**Appellant:**
- Insufficient evidence existed to prove when or precisely how the instruction was given or that he failed to rescind it.
- Even if the instruction was given, his actions were not serious enough for criminal liability, especially given no dishonest, corrupt, or malicious motive.
- The judge misapplied the law by not considering his subjective state of mind or the lack of practical difference between old and new lifejacket requirements.
- The sentence was manifestly excessive, as he continued a pre-existing policy, had no personal gain, and was of exemplary character.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**Nature of Misconduct in Public Office:**
- The offence requires proof of wilful misconduct that is serious, not trivial, and warrants criminal sanction (para 65).
- Misconduct can be nonfeasance (failure to perform a duty) or misfeasance (improper performance of a duty). Here, it was nonfeasance (para 43).
- For nonfeasance, the prosecution must prove wilful intent and absence of reasonable excuse or justification (para 41).

**Wilfulness and Seriousness:**
- "Wilful" means deliberate, not inadvertent (para 48). The judge correctly found the appellant's conduct deliberate.
- Seriousness is assessed objectively, considering the responsibilities of the office and the nature/extent of the departure from duty (para 65). The judge correctly found the appellant's actions serious due to their impact on public safety and legislative intent (para 23, 26).
- The judge was not required to consider the appellant's subjective appreciation of consequences or the actual safety outcomes, only whether his conduct was objectively serious (para 46-47).

**Reasonable Excuse/Justification:**
- The appellant's claimed excuse—that continuing the policy ensured "smooth implementation" of the law—was rejected as not a reasonable excuse (para 53). The court emphasized that appeasing industry representatives does not justify non-enforcement of safety laws.
- The appellant had no statutory power to exempt vessels from compliance and should have sought legal advice or consulted superiors (para 47, 52).

**Motive and Culpability:**
- While the appellant lacked a dishonest, corrupt, or malicious motive, this did not negate culpability for nonfeasance (para 39-44). The focus was on the breach of duty and its seriousness, not motive.
- The court distinguished *Shum Kwok Sher*, clarifying that absence of improper motive does not immunize nonfeasance from criminal liability if the conduct is serious (para 43).

**Sentencing Principles:**
- The judge correctly identified the seriousness of the misconduct but erred by not considering the appellant's comparative position—his predecessor and successors were not prosecuted (para 70). This fairness consideration reduced the sentence on appeal.
- The final sentence was reduced to time already served, as 6 months was deemed appropriate, given the appellant's exemplary character and the lack of distinction between him and others not prosecuted (para 71).

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

- **Selective Prosecution:** The most striking aspect is that the appellant was the only one prosecuted criminally while his predecessor and two successors, who continued the same non-enforcement policy, faced only disciplinary action. This raises fairness concerns, as noted by the court (para 70).
- **Policy Continuity:** The case highlights how a departmental policy can persist across multiple officials without scrutiny, only being challenged after a public tragedy.
- **Legal Principle Clarity:** The judgment provides a clear distinction between nonfeasance and misfeasance in misconduct cases, emphasizing that serious nonfeasance can be criminal even without improper motive.
- **Public Safety Focus:** The court's emphasis on the importance of enforcing safety regulations, even against industry pressure, underscores the prioritization of public safety over administrative convenience.
- **Sentence Reduction:** The reduction of the sentence to time already served, based on fairness and the appellant's character, is unusual in high-profile public office cases, where harsher sentences are often expected. [end of text]
