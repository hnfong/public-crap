Okay, let's tackle this case summary. First, I need to understand the case thoroughly. The case is Leung Kwok Hung and Others v. HKSAR [2005] HKCFA 40. The main issue is about the constitutionality of the Public Order Ordinance, specifically the Commissioner of Police's power to restrict public processions under the "public order (ordre public)" clause.

Starting with the facts: The appellants were convicted for holding an unauthorized assembly during a procession protesting the conviction of an activist. The procession was not notified to the police, and the police tried to stop them but were ignored. The court of appeal upheld the convictions, but the Supreme Court of Hong Kong (Chief Justice Li) overturned that, finding the Ordinance's provisions unconstitutional.

Now, the two parties' arguments. The appellants argue that the Commissioner's discretion under "public order (ordre public)" is too vague and not sufficiently prescribed by law, violating the Basic Law and ICCPR. The Government, represented by the respondent, defends the Ordinance, saying it's necessary for public order and that the law is constitutional, even if the term "public order" is broad.

For the legal principles, the ratio decidendi is that the Commissioner's power to restrict processions under "public order (ordre public)" is unconstitutional because it's too vague and doesn't meet the "prescribed by law" requirement. The Court emphasized that the term "public order" is imprecise and that the law must provide clear, precise standards. They also applied the proportionality test, but found that the Ordinance's provisions on "public order" are not sufficiently circumscribed. The Court distinguished between "public order" (law and order) and "public order (ordre public)" as a constitutional term, and concluded that the latter is too broad. They also discussed the need for legal certainty and that the Ordinance's provisions on "public order (ordre public)" don't meet that standard. The Court held that the Ordinance's notification and control provisions are constitutional, but the part about "public order (ordre public)" is not, so they should be severed.

What's striking about the case? The Court's decision to sever the "public order (ordre public)" part from the Ordinance is unusual. It's a detailed analysis of the constitutional requirements, especially the "prescribed by law" and "necessity" tests. The case is notable for its thorough examination of the balance between public order and individual rights, and the emphasis on legal certainty. Also, the Court's reliance on international human rights law, like the ICCPR and European Court of Human Rights cases, is significant. The case shows how Hong Kong's judiciary applies international standards to its own constitutional framework, which is a key aspect of the Basic Law. The decision to strike down the criminal sanctions in s.17A because they are tied to the unconstitutional powers is another unusual aspect. The case also highlights the importance of the "severance" doctrine in constitutional law, which is not commonly applied in Hong Kong. The Court's detailed explanation of the difference between "public order" and "public order (ordre public)" is a novel approach, emphasizing that the latter is too vague. The case is also remarkable for its comprehensive discussion of the proportionality test and the need for clear, specific standards in laws that restrict fundamental rights.

### 1. **Facts of the Case**  
The case involves the conviction of three individuals (Leung Kwok Hung, and two others) for holding an unauthorized assembly during a public procession on 10 February 2002. The procession, organized to protest the conviction of an activist for assault and obstruction of a police officer, was not notified to the Commissioner of Police under the Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245). The police had previously been present at Chater Garden, where a demonstration about the right of abode was taking place. The organizers, including Leung, were warned by the police to comply with the notification requirements but refused. The procession, which initially involved 40 people and later swelled to 96, proceeded peacefully, with participants gathering outside Police Headquarters to make speeches. The appellants were convicted under sections 17A(3)(b)(i) of the Ordinance for unauthorized assembly and assisting in its holding. The Court of Appeal upheld the convictions, but the Supreme Court of Hong Kong (Chief Justice Li) overturned this decision, finding the Ordinance’s statutory scheme for regulating public processions unconstitutional due to the Commissioner’s broad discretion under the term “public order (ordre public).” The Court concluded that the Ordinance’s provisions on “public order (ordre public)” failed to meet the constitutional requirement of “prescribed by law” and were therefore invalid, necessitating their severance from the Ordinance.

### 2. **Arguments of the Two Parties**  
**Appellants (Leung Kwok Hung et al.)**  
The appellants argued that the Commissioner of Police’s statutory discretion to restrict public processions under the term “public order (ordre public)” in the Ordinance was too vague and uncertain to satisfy the constitutional requirements of the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (BORO). They contended that the term “public order (ordre public)” is not sufficiently defined to ensure legal certainty, as it encompasses a wide range of undefined interests, including national security, public safety, and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. The appellants emphasized that the Ordinance’s provisions on “public order (ordre public)” were not narrowly tailored to protect the right of peaceful assembly, as required by the ICCPR and the Basic Law. They also argued that the criminal sanctions in section 17A of the Ordinance, which penalize unauthorized assemblies, were not justified by the constitutional necessity requirement, as the Ordinance’s notification and control provisions were not sufficiently clear or precise to meet the “prescribed by law” standard. The appellants sought to quash their convictions, asserting that the Ordinance’s provisions violated the constitutional guarantee of free assembly.

**Respondent (HKSAR Government)**  
The Government defended the Ordinance, asserting that the Commissioner’s discretion to restrict public processions under “public order (ordre public)” was constitutional. They argued that the term “public order (ordre public)” is a recognized constitutional concept under the Basic Law and the ICCPR, and that the Ordinance’s statutory scheme was designed to ensure public safety, prevent disorder, and protect the rights of others. The Government contended that the Ordinance’s notification and control requirements were necessary to enable the police to manage large gatherings and that the term “public order (ordre public)” was not inherently vague but was instead a broad, flexible concept that could be interpreted in the context of the law. They also emphasized that the Ordinance’s provisions were not arbitrary, as the Commissioner’s discretion was subject to appeal and judicial review, and that the criminal sanctions in section 17A were proportionate to the offenses committed. The Government argued that the Ordinance’s provisions were consistent with the Basic Law’s incorporation of the ICCPR and that the “public order (ordre public)” clause was not unconstitutional.

### 3. **Legal Principles (Ratio Decedendi)**  
The Supreme Court of Hong Kong held that the **Commissioner of Police’s statutory discretion to restrict public processions under the term “public order (ordre public)” in the Public Order Ordinance is unconstitutional** because it fails to meet the constitutional requirement of “prescribed by law” and the necessity requirement. The Court’s analysis of the legal principles is extensive and nuanced, reflecting a detailed application of international human rights law and constitutional interpretation.  

**A. The “Prescribed by Law” Requirement**  
The Court emphasized that the term “public order (ordre public)” is too vague and imprecise to satisfy the constitutional requirement that restrictions on fundamental rights must be “prescribed by law.” This requirement, derived from Article 39(2) of the Basic Law and Article 17 of the BORO, mandates that laws must provide clear, precise, and accessible standards to ensure legal certainty. The Court noted that while “public order” (in the law and order sense) is sufficiently defined, “public order (ordre public)” is a broader, more abstract concept that includes not only traditional public order but also “national security,” “public safety,” and the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. The Court held that the Ordinance’s use of “public order (ordre public)” as a legitimate purpose for restricting the right of peaceful assembly is unconstitutional because it does not provide a clear, objective standard for its application. The Court referenced the **Siracusa Principles**, which state that “public order (ordre public)” must be interpreted in the context of the specific human right being restricted, and that the term must be “sufficiently circumscribed” to avoid arbitrary enforcement. The Court also drew on the **European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR)** case of *Malone v. United Kingdom* (1984), which held that laws must provide “adequate guarantees against abuse” to satisfy the “prescribed by law” requirement. The Court concluded that the Ordinance’s use of “public order (ordre public)” is too broad and lacks the precision required to ensure that the law is not arbitrary or overly intrusive.  

**B. The Necessity Requirement**  
The Court applied the **proportionality test** to assess whether the Commissioner’s discretion to restrict processions under “public order (ordre public)” was necessary in a democratic society. The Court acknowledged that the term “public order (ordre public)” is not inherently vague but stressed that its
