Hmm, I need to analyze this Supreme Court case about presidential tariff authority under IEEPA. The user has provided a detailed syllabus and opinion, so I'll carefully break it down into the requested five parts.

First, the facts: President Trump declared national emergencies for drug trafficking and trade deficits, then imposed tariffs using IEEPA authority. Businesses and states sued, arguing IEEPA doesn't authorize tariffs. Lower courts split - DC Circuit blocked the tariffs while Federal Circuit upheld them. The Supreme Court consolidated the cases.

For the arguments, the government claims "regulate importation" includes tariffs, citing historical practice and statutory context. Plaintiffs counter that tariffs are distinct taxing powers requiring explicit authorization, which IEEPA lacks.

The majority's legal principles are fascinating. They anchor their decision in constitutional separation of powers - tariffs are core congressional authority. Applying the major questions doctrine, they demand clear authorization for such economically significant actions. Their statutory analysis finds "regulate" doesn't encompass taxation, noting IEEPA's verb list excludes tariff-related terms and that no president previously used IEEPA for tariffs.

The dissent sees this differently. Kavanaugh's opinion argues "regulate importation" historically includes tariffs, pointing to Nixon's similar actions and the Algonquin precedent. He contends the major questions doctrine shouldn't apply to foreign affairs statutes, where broad delegations are traditional. Thomas adds constitutional analysis that non-delegation principles are weaker in external affairs.

What's remarkable is how this exposes fundamental tensions in administrative law. The 6-3 split reflects deep divisions about executive power - with the majority tightening congressional control over trade policy while dissenters warn of hamstringing presidential crisis response. The multiple concurrences debating the major questions doctrine's nature (Gorsuch's clear-statement rule vs Barrett's contextual approach) make this a landmark for administrative law jurisprudence. Also striking is how the decision might not ultimately constrain tariffs much, since other statutes like Section 232 remain available - making this partly a procedural correction.

### 1. Summary of Facts  
President Trump declared two national emergencies under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA): one addressing drug trafficking from Canada, Mexico, and China, and another targeting "large and persistent" trade deficits. He imposed tariffs (25% on most Canadian/Mexican imports, 10% on Chinese imports for drugs; at least 10% globally for trade deficits) and later modified rates. Small businesses and states sued, arguing IEEPA does not authorize tariffs. Lower courts blocked the tariffs, ruling IEEPA’s grant to "regulate importation" excludes tariff imposition. The Supreme Court consolidated appeals from the D.C. Circuit and Federal Circuit.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties  
- **Government (President Trump)**: Argued IEEPA’s text—specifically "regulate...importation"—authorizes tariffs as a regulatory tool. Cited historical precedent (e.g., Nixon’s 1971 tariffs under similar statutory language) and asserted tariffs are a standard means to regulate trade during emergencies.  
- **Plaintiffs (Businesses/States)**: Contended IEEPA does not explicitly mention "tariffs" or "duties," and imposing them usurps Congress’s exclusive taxing power under Article I. Argued "regulate" cannot encompass revenue-raising measures, and tariffs’ economic significance triggers the "major questions doctrine," requiring explicit congressional authorization.  

### 3. Majority Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
**Constitutional Foundation**:  
- Article I, §8 vests exclusive tariff/taxing power in Congress. Tariffs are a "branch of the taxing power" (per *Gibbons v. Ogden*), and the Executive lacks inherent peacetime authority to impose them.  

**Major Questions Doctrine**:  
- For "extraordinary" assertions of power with vast economic/political consequences, Congress must provide "clear authorization." The doctrine applies here because:  
  - Tariffs affect "the core congressional power of the purse" and implicate separation of powers.  
  - IEEPA tariffs are "unheralded"—no president used IEEPA for tariffs in its 49-year history.  
  - Their scale ($4T deficit impact, $15T trade deals) dwarfs prior "major questions" cases (e.g., *West Virginia v. EPA*).  
- **No Foreign Affairs Exception**: The doctrine applies even to foreign threats; tariffs remain a legislative power Congress would not delegate ambiguously.  

**Statutory Interpretation**:  
- IEEPA’s text ("investigate, block, regulate...importation") omits "tariffs" or "duties," unlike other tariff-specific statutes (e.g., Trade Act of 1974).  
- "Regulate" means to "control by rule" (per dictionaries) and does not include taxation. Contextual clues (e.g., neighboring verbs like "prohibit" or "void") suggest regulatory, not revenue-raising, tools.  
- Historical Precedent (*Algonquin*) is distinguishable: It involved distinct statutory language ("adjust the imports") and explicit references to duties.  

**Jurisdiction**:  
- The Court of International Trade (CIT) has exclusive jurisdiction over challenges arising from tariff modifications.  

### 4. Dissenting Arguments (Kavanaugh, joined by Thomas and Alito)  
**Statutory Text and History**:  
- "Regulate importation" historically includes tariffs. Dictionaries, Founding-era practices (e.g., Marshall, Story, Madison), and Nixon’s 1971 tariffs (upheld under similar language) confirm this.  
- IEEPA’s enactment (1977) postdated *Algonquin* (1976), which approved tariffs under analogous "adjust the imports" language. Congress would have excluded tariffs explicitly if unintended.  

**Major Questions Doctrine Inapplicable**:  
- **Clear Authorization Exists**: Text, history, and precedent provide unambiguous support for tariffs under IEEPA.  
- **Foreign Affairs Exception**: The doctrine should not apply to foreign policy statutes, where Congress traditionally delegates broad discretion (per *Curtiss-Wright*). Tariffs are a tool for national emergencies, and IEEPA includes safeguards (e.g., reporting, 1-year limits).  

**Practical and Constitutional Concerns**:  
- The majority’s "magic words" requirement (demanding "tariff" or "duty" in text) contradicts precedent (*Algonquin*) and hampers presidential flexibility.  
- Congress can check tariffs via appropriations or legislation; invalidating them causes chaos (e.g., refunds, trade-deal uncertainty).  

**Thomas’s Addendum**:  
- Nondelegation principles are weaker in foreign affairs. Tariffs regulate "privileges," not core rights, and align with historical executive prerogatives.  

### 5. Striking/Unusual Aspects  
1. **Fractured Opinions**:  
   - The 6-3 ruling masked deep divisions:  
     - **Concurrences**: Gorsuch defended the major questions doctrine as a clear-statement rule; Barrett framed it as "commonsense" context; Kagan/Jacksonsaw no need for the doctrine, relying solely on statutory interpretation.  
     - **Dissent**: Kavanaugh called the majority’s foreign-affairs intrusion "novel and unprecedented."  
   - This highlights the Court’s ideological rift on executive power and statutory interpretation.  

2. **Historical Irony**:  
   - The Court invalidated tariffs under IEEPA but noted identical authority exists elsewhere (e.g., Section 232). The ruling thus becomes a technical correction—"checking the wrong box"—not a substantive constraint on trade policy.  

3. **Real-World Chaos**:  
   - Refunding billions in tariffs could create a "mess" (per oral arguments), and unraveling trade deals risks global economic uncertainty.  

4. **Constitutional Tension**:  
   - The case crystallizes the struggle between legislative control (Article I) and executive agility in crises—a tension amplified by IEEPA’s use in 70+ ongoing emergencies since 1979.  

**Final Remark**: The decision signals the Court’s skepticism of "transformative" executive actions lacking explicit congressional buy-in, reinforcing *West Virginia v. EPA*’s legacy in the trade-policy arena. [end of text]
