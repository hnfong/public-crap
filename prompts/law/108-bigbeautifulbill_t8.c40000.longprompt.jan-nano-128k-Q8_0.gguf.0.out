Okay, I need to help the user understand the bill by summarizing each section. They want a concise summary for each "Sec." with at most one paragraph, four sentences, and specific details on parties, entities, and quantities. Let me start with Sec. 80001.

First, Sec. 80001 is about exempting certain assets from student loan eligibility. The user mentioned that the bill is from President Trump, so I should note that. The key changes here are the exemptions for family farms, small businesses with up to 100 employees, and commercial fishing businesses. The effective date is July 1, 2026, and it applies to award year 2026-2027 and onwards. I need to make sure to mention the exact amounts and the entities involved, like the Secretary of Education.

Next, Sec. 81001 deals with loan limits for graduate and professional students. It terminates the PLUS loans for those students starting July 1, 2026, and sets new annual and aggregate limits. The user wants specifics, so I should note the amounts: $20,500 for non-professional grad students, $50,000 for professional students. Also, the parent borrower limits for PLUS loans are $20,000 annually and $65,000 aggregate. The lifetime maximum is $257,500 for all students except PLUS loans. Also, the effective date is July 1, 2026, and the interim exception applies to those who had loans before that date.

Then, Sec. 82001 is about loan repayment plans. The main points are the transition to income-based repayment plans by July 2028, the new Repayment Assistance Plan with specific terms like monthly payments based on income, interest subsidies, and principal payment matching. The user wants to know the exact amounts and the entities involved, like the Secretary of Education. Also, the effective date for the new plan is July 1, 2026, and the old plans are phased out by 2028.

Sec. 82002 is about deferment and forbearance. The economic hardship and unemployment deferments are sunset after July 1, 2027, and forbearance is limited to 9 months every 24 months starting July 1, 2027. The user needs to know the dates and the specific terms for forbearance.

Sec. 82003 is about loan rehabilitation. The limits are increased to two times instead of one, and the minimum monthly payment is $10 for those with loans from July 1, 2027. The user should note the change in the number of times and the new payment amount.

Sec. 82004 is about public service loan forgiveness. The amendment adds a new clause allowing on-time payments under the Repayment Assistance Plan to count towards forgiveness. The user needs to know the specific clause added and the effective date.

Sec. 82005 is about student loan servicing. The Secretary gets $1 billion for administrative costs, including servicing direct loans. The user should mention the exact amount and the entities involved, like the Secretary of Education.

For Subtitle D, Sec. 83001 (Pell Grants) changes the eligibility to include foreign income of parents, effective July 1, 2026. The user needs to know the specific changes in the adjusted gross income calculation and the effective date.

Sec. 83002 (Workforce Pell Grants) introduces a new program for eligible workforce programs, with specific requirements like 150 clock hours, job placement rates, and a $12.67 billion increase in Pell Shortfall. The user should note the new program's terms and the funding increase.

Sec. 83003 (Pell Shortfall) increases the funding from $2.17 billion to $12.67 billion, which is a significant change. The user needs to know the exact amount and the effective date.

Sec. 83004 (Pell Grant Exclusion) excludes students from Pell Grants if they receive non-Federal grant aid equal to or exceeding their cost of attendance. The user should mention the exclusion amount and the effective date.

Subtitle E, Sec. 84001 (Ineligibility based on low earning outcomes) changes the requirements for institutions to ensure they meet median earnings standards. The user needs to know the specific data sources, the 3-year covered period, and the appeal process.

Subtitle F, Sec. 85001 (Regulatory Relief) delays the borrower defense to repayment rules until 2035, restoring them to their original state. The user should note the dates and the specific regulations affected.

Sec. 85002 (Closed School Discharges) delays the rules for closed school discharges until 2035, restoring them as if the amendments never happened. The user needs to know the dates and the specific regulations.

Subtitle G, Sec. 86001 (Garden of Heroes) appropriates $40 million for the National Endowment for the Humanities to support statues related to American heroes. The user should mention the exact amount and the entities involved.

Subtitle H, Sec. 87001 (Refugee Resettlement) appropriates $300 million for the Office of Refugee Resettlement to vet sponsors for unaccompanied alien children. The user needs to know the amount, the effective date, and the specific uses of the funds, like background checks and home studies.

I need to make sure each summary is concise, specific, and includes all the key details without being vague. Also, check that each section is covered and that the dates and amounts are accurate. Avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and direct.
