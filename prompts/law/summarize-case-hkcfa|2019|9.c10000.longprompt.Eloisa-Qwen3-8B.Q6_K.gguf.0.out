Okay, I need to tackle this case summary for the user. Let me start by understanding the case. The case is Secretary for Justice v. Cheng Ka Yee and others, which deals with the interpretation of Section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance in Hong Kong. The main issue is whether using one's own computer to obtain information for dishonest gain constitutes an offense under this section.

First, I'll summarize the facts. The respondents were teachers who obtained interview questions for a school admission process. They used their own devices or a school computer to take photos or send the questions to others. They were charged under Section 161(1)(c), but were acquitted. The appeal was about whether using their own computer counts as "obtaining access to a computer" for the offense.

Next, the arguments. The prosecution argued that the section covers any unauthorized access, including using one's own device. The defense argued that the section is meant for accessing others' computers, and using one's own doesn't fit. The court had to decide on the scope of "obtaining access."

For the legal principles, the ratio decidendi is that Section 161(1)(c) doesn't apply to using one's own computer unless it involves accessing another's. The court looked at the text, context, and purpose of the law. They emphasized that the term "obtain access" implies unauthorized use, and the legislative intent was to target preparatory acts for fraud, not personal use. The court also considered the legislative history, including debates and amendments, to show that the law was meant to cover unauthorized access to others' computers.

What's striking about this case is how it clarifies the boundaries of computer misuse laws. It shows that even with technological advancements, the law's original intent remains focused on protecting others' data, not personal devices. The case also highlights the importance of statutory interpretation in balancing public policy with legal text. The detailed analysis of legislative history and purpose provides a thorough framework for future cases.

### 1. Summary of the Facts  
The case involves four individuals—three primary school teachers and a former classmate—who were charged under Section 161(1)(c) of Hong Kong’s Crimes Ordinance for obtaining access to computers with a view to dishonest gain. The incident occurred during a competitive admission interview process for a government-subsidized school. The teachers were briefed on the interview questions and marking scheme, which were provided in plastic folders. Using their own smartphones or a school computer, they photographed or transmitted the questions to third parties via WhatsApp or email. The charges alleged that their actions constituted unauthorized access to computers for dishonest purposes. However, the respondents were acquitted by a magistrate, who found reasonable doubt regarding the necessary elements of dishonesty and unauthorized access. The Secretary for Justice appealed the acquittal, arguing that the use of personal devices or authorized computers still constituted the offense. The Court of Final Appeal ultimately dismissed the appeal, holding that Section 161(1)(c) does not apply to the use of one’s own computer for dishonest gain unless it involves accessing another’s computer.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties  
**Prosecution (Appellant, Secretary for Justice):**  
The prosecution argued that Section 161(1)(c) should be interpreted broadly to cover any unauthorized access to a computer, regardless of whether the device belonged to the user. They emphasized the legislative intent behind the 1993 Computer Crimes Ordinance, which aimed to criminalize preparatory acts for fraud, including the misuse of computers for dishonest gain. The prosecution submitted that modern technological advancements, such as electronic banking and social media, had created new avenues for computer-related offenses that the law should address. They cited examples like clandestine photography, phishing, and identity theft to argue that a restrictive interpretation would leave significant legal gaps. The prosecution also highlighted the text of the statute, noting that the phrase “obtain access to a computer” is not limited to unauthorized devices and that the offense should be applied to any dishonest use of a computer.  

**Defense (Respondents):**  
The defense contended that the statute’s language, context, and purpose clearly limit the offense to unauthorized access to computers belonging to others. They argued that the term “obtain access” inherently implies unauthorized use, as it refers to gaining entry to something one does not already control. The defense emphasized that the legislative history of Section 161, including debates in the Legislative Council and amendments to the Bill, demonstrated that the provision was intended to target preparatory acts involving others’ computers, not personal devices. They also highlighted the redundancy in the statutory language and the lack of a textual basis for extending the offense to one’s own computer. The defense further submitted that a broad interpretation would lead to absurd consequences, such as criminalizing routine personal use of computers, and would undermine the principle of mens rea by conflating authorized and unauthorized conduct.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) of the Case  
The Court of Final Appeal’s decision in *Secretary for Justice v. Cheng Ka Yee* establishes a detailed framework for interpreting Section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance. The ratio decidendi centers on the scope of the offense and the distinction between authorized and unauthorized use of computers.  

#### **Textual Interpretation**  
The Court emphasized that the statutory language of Section 161(1)(c)—“obtain access to a computer with a view to dishonest gain”—must be interpreted in light of its ordinary meaning. The term “obtain access” was defined as gaining entry to something one does not already
