### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case involves a dispute over the validity of two wills executed by Nina Wang, a wealthy businesswoman and philanthropist. The first will, dated July 28, 2002 (the "2002 will"), bequeathed her entire estate to the Chinacheem Charitable Foundation Ltd. The second will, dated October 16, 2006 (the "2006 will"), named Chan Chun Chuen (the first defendant) as the beneficiary. Nina Wang died on April 3, 2007, and shortly after her death, the first defendant produced the 2006 will.

The plaintiff, Chinacheem Charitable Foundation Ltd, sought to have the 2002 will pronounced valid and the 2006 will declared a forgery. The first defendant argued that the 2006 will was genuine and that Nina Wang had intended to revoke the 2002 will in favor of the 2006 will.

The judge found that the 2006 will was a forgery, based on evidence that included the testimony of the will's witnesses, handwriting analysis, and the unusual circumstances surrounding the will's production and subsequent disclosure.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments

**Plaintiff's Argument:**
- The 2002 will was valid and Nina Wang had consistently expressed her intention to leave her estate to the Chinacheem Charitable Foundation.
- The 2006 will was a forgery, as evidenced by the testimony of the witnesses who attested to the will, the handwriting analysis, and the unusual circumstances surrounding the will's production and subsequent disclosure.
- Nina Wang's relationship with the first defendant was kept secret and did not justify the drastic change in her will.
- The 2006 will was inconsistent with Nina Wang's known charitable intentions and her consistent support for the Chinacheem Charitable Foundation.

**First Defendant's Argument:**
- The 2006 will was genuine and reflected Nina Wang's true intentions.
- Nina Wang had a deep and loving relationship with the first defendant, which justified the change in her will.
- The testimony of the witnesses who attested to the will was unreliable and had been influenced by the plaintiff's case.
- The handwriting analysis was flawed and did not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that the signatures were forgeries.
- The circumstances surrounding the will's production and subsequent disclosure were consistent with Nina Wang's desire to keep the will secret until her death.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The key legal principles in this case include:

**a. Burden of Proof in Probate Disputes:**
The court must carefully evaluate the evidence and consider the inherent probabilities and improbabilities before making factual findings. The judge must weigh the evidence and consider the credibility of witnesses, especially in cases involving allegations of forgery.

**b. Forgery of Wills:**
The court found that the 2006 will was a forgery based on the testimony of the witnesses who attested to the will, the handwriting analysis, and the unusual circumstances surrounding the will's production and subsequent disclosure. The judge considered the improbability of Nina Wang preparing the will herself given her physical condition and the lack of any copy of the will found at the Chinachem premises.

**c. Credibility of Witnesses:**
The judge's assessment of the credibility of the witnesses was crucial in determining the validity of the will. The judge found that the testimony of the witnesses who attested to the will was unreliable and that the first defendant had tailored his evidence to suit his case.

**d. Handwriting Analysis:**
The court accepted the expert handwriting analysis that the signatures on the 2006 will were forgeries. The judge considered the rarity of certain features in the questioned signatures and the accumulation of these rare features as significant evidence of forgery.

**e. Probate Litigation and Abuse of Process:**
The court emphasized that pursuing a thoroughly dishonest case and abusing the process of the court justifies an order for costs on an indemnity basis. The judge's findings of forgery and dishonesty were significant in determining the costs order.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case

**a. Scale of the Dispute:**
The case involved a dispute over a fortune estimated at around $100 billion, making it one of the largest probate disputes in history.

**b. Complex Relationship Dynamics:**
The case highlighted the complex and secretive relationship between Nina Wang and the first defendant, Chan Chun Chuen. The judge's findings about the nature of their relationship and its implications for the validity of the will were significant.

**c. Extensive Use of Fung Shui:**
The case revealed Nina Wang's extensive use of fung shui, including the digging of holes and other rituals, which were central to her relationship with the first defendant and her health practices.

**d. Expert Handwriting Analysis:**
The case involved detailed expert handwriting analysis, which played a crucial role in determining the validity of the will. The court's acceptance of the expert's findings and the statistical approach to handwriting analysis was notable.

**e. Costs Order:**
The judge's decision to order costs on an indemnity basis due to the first defendant's dishonesty and abuse of the court process was unusual and emphasized the seriousness of the findings against the first defendant.

**f. Public Interest:**
The case attracted significant public interest due to the high-profile nature of the parties involved and the enormous sums of money at stake. The judge's findings and the subsequent appeal process were closely followed by the media and the public. 

These aspects of the case make it a remarkable and noteworthy legal dispute, not only for its financial implications but also for the complex personal and cultural dynamics it revealed. [end of text]
