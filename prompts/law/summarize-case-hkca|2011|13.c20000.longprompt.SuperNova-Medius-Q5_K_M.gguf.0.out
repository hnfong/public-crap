### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case of CHINACHEM CHARITABLE FOUNDATION LTD v. CHAN CHUN CHUEN AND ANOTHER [2011] HKCA 13 involved a dispute over the validity of two wills executed by the late Nina Wang, a prominent businesswoman and philanthropist. The plaintiff, Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd, sought to have the 2002 will declared valid and the 2006 will declared a forgery. The first defendant, Chan Chun Chuen, claimed the 2006 will was genuine and sought to have the 2002 will declared invalid.

Nina Wang established the Chinachem Charitable Foundation in 1988 with her late husband, Teddy Wang. In 2002, she executed a will (the 2002 will) bequeathing her entire estate to the foundation. In 2006, a second will (the 2006 will) was produced, naming the first defendant as the beneficiary.

The first defendant, Chan Chun Chuen, was introduced to Nina Wang in 1992 as a fung shui master. He claimed that he and Nina Wang had an intimate relationship and that she had given him the 2006 will shortly before her death. However, the judge found that Chan was untrustworthy and had lied about his relationship with Nina Wang and the circumstances surrounding the 2006 will.

The judge also found that Nina Wang had a history of making substantial donations to the first defendant and had engaged in various fung shui activities with him. Despite these activities, the judge concluded that Nina Wang had never deviated from her intention to leave her estate to the Chinachem Charitable Foundation.

The judge's findings were based on the testimony of witnesses, including Nina Wang's former solicitor and a long-term employee of the Chinachem Group, as well as handwriting expert evidence. The judge ultimately concluded that the 2006 will was a forgery and that the 2002 will was valid.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments

**Plaintiff's Argument:**
The plaintiff, Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd, argued that the 2006 will was a forgery and that the 2002 will was the valid last will of Nina Wang. They presented evidence that Nina Wang had consistently supported the foundation and had never expressed a desire to change her will. The plaintiff also highlighted the inconsistencies in the first defendant's testimony and the improbability of Nina Wang having prepared the 2006 will herself given her declining health.

**First Defendant's Argument:**
The first defendant, Chan Chun Chuen, argued that the 2006 will was genuine and that Nina Wang had intended to leave her estate to him. He claimed that he and Nina Wang had an intimate relationship and that she had given him the 2006 will shortly before her death. The first defendant also argued that the judge had not properly evaluated the evidence by considering the inherent probabilities and improbabilities before making factual findings. He further contended that the handwriting expert evidence was flawed and that the judge had erred in accepting the expert's conclusions.

### 3. Summary of the Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The legal principles established in this case are significant for probate litigation and the evaluation of evidence in such cases. The key points include:

**1. Evaluation of Evidence:**
The court emphasized the importance of evaluating evidence by considering the inherent probabilities and improbabilities. The judge's findings were based on a meticulous examination of the evidence, including witness testimony, handwriting expert evidence, and the circumstances surrounding the execution of the wills. The court upheld the judge's approach, noting that the judge had carefully considered the first defendant's arguments and had not erred in his evaluation of the evidence.

**2. Forgery of Wills:**
The case established that the presence of significant differences and rarities in a questioned signature can be highly indicative of forgery. The court accepted the expert evidence that the Nina Wang and Winfield Wong signatures on the 2006 will were forgeries. The judge's analysis of the handwriting evidence, including the identification of significant differences and rarities, was upheld by the court.

**3. Credibility of Witnesses:**
The court emphasized the importance of assessing the credibility of witnesses in probate litigation. The judge's findings regarding the first defendant's untrustworthiness and the inconsistencies in his testimony were upheld by the court. The court noted that the judge had carefully considered the evidence and had not erred in his assessment of the witnesses' credibility.

**4. Probate Litigation and Costs:**
The case established that in probate litigation, costs orders should reflect the egregious nature of the conduct of the parties. The court upheld the judge's order for costs on an indemnity basis, noting that the first defendant's conduct in pursuing a forged will was an abuse of the court process. The court also upheld the judge's decision to order the first defendant to indemnify the estate for the costs of the Secretary for Justice, who had been joined as a party to the action.

**5. Handwriting Expert Evidence:**
The case established that handwriting expert evidence is a crucial factor in determining the authenticity of signatures in probate litigation. The court upheld the judge's acceptance of the expert evidence, noting that the expert's approach was consistent with accepted principles of handwriting identification. The court rejected the first defendant's criticisms of the expert evidence, finding that the expert's conclusions were supported by the evidence.

In conclusion, the case of CHINACHEM CHARITABLE FOUNDATION LTD v. CHAN CHUN CHUEN AND ANOTHER [2011] HKCA 13 established important principles for probate litigation, including the importance of evaluating evidence by considering inherent probabilities and improbabilities, the significance of handwriting expert evidence, and the need to assess the credibility of witnesses.
