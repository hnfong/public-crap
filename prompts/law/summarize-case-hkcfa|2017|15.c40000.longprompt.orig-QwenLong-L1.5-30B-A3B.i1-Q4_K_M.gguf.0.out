Okay, let's tackle this case summary. The user provided a detailed legal judgment from the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal regarding a bribery case under the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO). The task is to break it down into four parts: facts, arguments, legal principles, and any striking aspects.

First, I need to summarize the facts. The case involves two appellants, Chan Chi Wan and Tseng Pei Kun. Chan was a TVB employee who hosted a show called "Be My Guest," which became popular. Olympian City (OC) wanted to include a live segment of this show in their New Year's Eve Countdown event. OC paid Tseng, who was Chan's agent, $160,000, and Tseng gave Chan $112,000. Chan didn't get TVB's permission for this outside work, which he was contractually required to do. The prosecution charged them under section 9 of POBO for conspiracy and accepting an advantage. The trial judge acquitted them, but the Court of Appeal overturned that, leading to the final appeal to the Court of Final Appeal.

Wait, I need to make sure I get the facts straight. Chan was General Manager (Broadcasting) at TVB, hosted a show that became popular, so he was a celebrity. OC wanted to add his show to their Countdown event. They paid Tseng, who was Chan's agent, to arrange his appearance. Chan got $112k, but TVB didn't know about the payment. The key issue is whether Chan's appearance was "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" as required by section 9.

Next, the arguments of the two parties. The prosecution (respondent) argued that Chan's appearance was part of TVB's business because the show was broadcast by TVB, so it related to TVB's affairs. The defense (appellants) said Chan was acting as a celebrity, not in his capacity as TVB's agent, so it wasn't related to TVB's business. The Court of Appeal agreed with the prosecution, but the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) reversed that, holding that the act must be adverse to the principal's interests, which it wasn't here since TVB benefited from the show.

Now, the legal principles. The main issue is the interpretation of "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" under section 9. The CFA, particularly Ribeiro PJ, emphasized that the act must undermine the integrity of the agency relationship, meaning it has to be detrimental to the principal. The Court relied on Ch'ng Poh, where the Privy Council said the act must be "aimed at" the principal and intended to influence or affect their affairs. But the CFA added that the influence must be adverse, not beneficial. The Court also discussed the removal of "corruptly" from the statute, clarifying that it doesn't mean any payment without consent is an offense, but the payment must be for an act that harms the principal.

Wait, the CFA had a split. Tang PJ thought the act was related to TVB's business but that Chan had a reasonable excuse because TVB knew he was appearing. Ribeiro PJ and Fok PJ disagreed, saying the act wasn't even within section 9 because it wasn't adverse. So the ratio decidendi is that for section 9 to apply, the agent's act must be intended to harm the principal's interests, not benefit them. The Court rejected the Court of Appeal's view that any act related to the principal's business suffices, even if beneficial.

I need to make sure I cover the key points: the necessity of adverse impact, the interpretation of "in relation to," the role of mens rea, and the reasonable excuse defense. The CFA's novel point is that the act must be detrimental, which wasn't clearly established before. The Court also clarified that the removal of "corruptly" doesn't eliminate the need for a qualitative assessment of the payment's purpose.

For the striking aspects, the case is about a TVB employee hosting a show that was part of a sponsored event. The fact that the prosecution tried to criminalize a situation where the principal (TVB) actually benefited from the agent's (Chan's) actions is unusual. Also, the CFA's emphasis on the necessity of adverse impact is a significant departure from the Court of Appeal's reasoning. Another striking point is the detailed discussion on the legislative history, especially the Attorney General's comments about removing "corruptly" to avoid proving corrupt motive, but the Court clarifying that the offense still requires a harmful act.

Wait, let me check if I missed anything. The Court of Appeal had argued that Chan's participation would affect TVB's business (e.g., if he refused, TVB might need alternative programming), but the CFA said that's not the point. The key is whether the act was intended to harm, not whether it could have affected the business. So the CFA's reasoning is that the prosecution must show the act was meant to undermine the agency relationship, not just that it was related to the business.

Also, the reasonable excuse part: the CFA held that since the act wasn't even within section 9, the reasonable excuse defense wasn't needed. But Tang PJ thought there was a reasonable excuse because TVB knew about the appearance. However, the majority (Ribeiro and Fok) didn't get to that because they found the act wasn't covered by section 9.

I need to make sure the legal principles section is thorough. The ratio decidendi is that "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" requires the act to be intended to influence or affect the principal's affairs in a way that undermines the agency relationship (i.e., is detrimental). The Court rejected the idea that any act related to the principal's business suffices, even if beneficial. The mens rea is that the agent must know the advantage was provided to influence the principal's affairs detrimentally.

Wait, the CFA also discussed the difference between section 9 and section 4 (for public servants). Section 4 requires the act to be in the agent's capacity as a public servant, but section 9 requires the act to be related to the principal's business. The Court clarified that section 9 isn't just about secret commissions but requires a harmful act.

Another point: the Court rejected the argument that "aimed at" means just any connection, stressing that it must be intended to affect the principal's affairs adversely. The example given was that if an agent does something beneficial, it's not a section 9 offense, even if it's related to the business.

For the striking aspects, the case is notable because it's a high-profile TV personality case, and the Court's decision prevents criminalizing beneficial acts. Also, the detailed analysis of the legislative history and the Privy Council's Ch'ng Poh case shows the Court's careful construction of the statute. The fact that the prosecution tried to use a section meant for corruption in private sector dealings to prosecute a situation where the principal actually gained from the agent's actions is quite unusual.

Wait, the user asked for the ratio decidendi. So the key legal principles are:

1. The phrase "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" in section 9 requires that the agent's act be intended to influence or affect the principal's affairs in a manner that undermines the agency relationship (i.e., is detrimental to the principal's interests).

2. The removal of "corruptly" from the statute does not mean that any payment without consent is an offense; the payment must be for an act that is detrimental.

3. The Court of Appeal erred in holding that the act was within section 9 merely because it was related to the principal's business, without considering whether it was detrimental.

4. The mens rea for the agent is that they knew the advantage was provided to influence the principal's affairs detrimentally.

I should also mention the split in the CFA: Ribeiro and Fok held that the act wasn't even within section 9, while Tang held that it was but there was a reasonable excuse. The majority (Ribeiro and Fok) allowed the appeals, quashing the convictions.

Wait, the user asked for the ratio decidendi. The ratio is the majority's reasoning, so Ribeiro's view that the act must be detrimental. The Court's conclusion that the prosecution didn't prove the act was detrimental, so section 9 didn't apply.

Also, the Court clarified that "aimed at" means intended to influence the principal's affairs, but the influence must be adverse. The Court rejected the Court of Appeal's view that the influence could be beneficial.

Another point: the Court distinguished Fung Hok Cheung, where the agent's act (leaking confidential info) harmed the principal's reputation, which is a detriment. So the Court used that case to support the need for detriment.

For the striking aspects, the case is remarkable because it's a celebrity case where the agent's actions actually helped the principal, and the Court refused to criminalize it. This is a significant limitation on the scope of section 9, preventing overreach. Also, the detailed judicial analysis of the legislative intent and the Privy Council's precedent shows the Court's meticulous approach.

Wait, the user mentioned "anything striking, unusual or remarkable." The fact that the prosecution tried to charge someone for accepting money for a show that TVB was broadcasting and that TVB actually benefited from it is pretty unusual. Normally, bribery cases involve harm to the principal, but here the principal was a beneficiary. So the Court's decision aligns with the purpose of the ordinance, which is to prevent corruption that harms the principal, not to criminalize all outside dealings.

Also, the case involved a popular TV show, "Be My Guest," which was a real thing, so it's a high-profile case with public interest. The appellants were a TV executive and his agent, which adds to the notoriety.

I need to make sure all these points are covered in the summary. Let me structure the answer as per the tasks.

First, the facts: summarize the key events—Chan's role, the show, OC's sponsorship, the payment, the charges, and the procedural history (trial, two appeals, CFA).

Second, the arguments: prosecution argued the act was related to TVB's business, defense said it was as a celebrity, not related. Court of Appeal agreed with prosecution, CFA reversed.

Third, legal principles: focus on the interpretation of "in relation to," the necessity of adverse impact, the mens rea, the distinction from Ch'ng Poh, and the reasonable excuse. Highlight the novel point that the act must be detrimental, not just related.

Fourth, striking aspects: the beneficial nature of the act, the celebrity context, the Court's limitation of section 9's scope, and the legislative history discussion.

Wait, the user said "be detailed and thorough" for the legal principles. So I need to explain the reasoning step by step, referencing Ch'ng Poh, the Court of Appeal's error, the CFA's analysis of the mischief of the ordinance, and the examples given (like the cricketers in Majeed, the secret commissions in Morgan).

Also, the Court's rejection of the idea that "aimed at" doesn't require a negative impact. The Court said that the Privy Council in Ch'ng Poh didn't say the influence must be adverse, but the Court here interprets it that way based on the ordinance's purpose.

Wait, the Court in the judgment says that Ch'ng Poh didn't say the influence must be adverse, but the Court argues that the legislative intent requires it. So the novel point is that even though Ch'ng Poh didn't explicitly say the influence must be adverse, the Court infers it from the mischief of the ordinance.

Yes, that's a key point. The Court uses the mischief rule (legislative purpose) to interpret the phrase, saying that the ordinance is meant to prevent corruption that harms the principal, not to criminalize all acts related to the business.

Also, the Court distinguishes Fung Hok Cheung, where the agent's act harmed the principal's reputation, so it was detrimental. In this case, the act was beneficial, so no offense.

Another point: the Court clarifies that the reasonable excuse defense isn't applicable here because the act wasn't even within section 9. So the majority didn't need to address the reasonable excuse, which was a point of contention in Tang PJ's judgment.

For the striking aspects, the case is notable for being a rare instance where the principal (TVB) actually benefited from the agent's (Chan's) actions, and the Court refused to convict, emphasizing that the law isn't meant to criminalize beneficial acts. This is a significant limitation on the scope of section 9, which could prevent overreach in similar cases.

Also, the case involved a popular TV show, so it's a real-world example that's relatable, making the legal principles more tangible. The fact that the agent was a public servant (as TVB is a public body) but the case was under section 9 (private sector agents) rather than section 4 (public servants) is another nuance.

Wait, the judgment mentions that Chan was a public servant because TVB is a public body, but the prosecution chose section 9 instead of section 4. The Court notes that section 4 requires the act to be in the agent's capacity as a public servant, but section 9 is broader. However, the Court's analysis focused on section 9's requirements.

I think that's all. Now, I need to structure the answer as per the four tasks, making sure each part is concise but covers all necessary points. Let me check the word count—no limit for the legal principles, so I can be thorough there.

Wait, the user said "briefly summarize" for the first two tasks, so I need to keep those short. The legal principles need to be detailed. The striking aspects should highlight the unusual elements.

Let me draft each section.

1. Facts: Summarize the key points—Chan's position, the show, OC's sponsorship, payment structure, charges under section 9, trial and appeals leading to CFA.

2. Arguments: Prosecution's view that the act was related to TVB's business; defense's view that it was as a celebrity, not related. Court of Appeal's reasoning vs. CFA's.

3. Legal principles: The core is the interpretation of "in relation to," the necessity of adverse impact, the mens rea, the reliance on Ch'ng Poh and other cases, the distinction from Fung Hok Cheung, the legislative history, and the conclusion that the act must be detrimental.

4. Striking aspects: Beneficial act, celebrity context, Court's limitation of section 9, legislative history discussion, and the split in the CFA (though the majority agreed on the outcome).

Wait, the CFA had a split in reasoning but unanimous in outcome. Ribeiro and Fok held the act wasn't within section 9, Tang held it was but there was a reasonable excuse. So the ratio decidendi is the majority's reasoning.

I need to make sure that in the legal principles, I focus on the majority's reasoning. So the key point is that the act must be detrimental to the principal's interests, which wasn't shown here.

Also, the Court clarified that the phrase "in relation to" requires the act to be "aimed at" the principal and intended to influence their affairs, but the influence must be adverse. So it's not just any connection, but a harmful one.

Another point: the Court rejected the idea that the Court of Appeal's reasoning (that TVB would be prejudiced if Chan refused) was sufficient. The Court said that the prejudice must be actual or intended, not hypothetical.

Wait, the Court of Appeal argued that if Chan refused, TVB would have to arrange alternative programming, affecting their relationship with OC. But the CFA said that's not the point; the issue is whether the act itself was intended to harm, not whether it could have caused harm if not done.

So the key is the agent's intent, not the potential consequences. The agent must have intended to harm the principal, not just that the act might have had consequences.

Wait, the mens rea for the agent is that they knew the advantage was provided to influence the principal's affairs detrimentally. So the agent must have known that the payment was for an act that would harm TVB. But in this case, Chan was acting as a celebrity, so he didn't intend to harm TVB; in fact, TVB benefited. So the mens rea wasn't met.

Yes, that's a crucial point. The Court held that since Chan's act was beneficial, he couldn't have intended it to harm TVB, so the mens rea for section 9 wasn't satisfied.

Okay, putting it all together. Let me make sure each part of the task is addressed.
</think>

### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts  
The case involves **Stephen Chan Chi Wan** (a TVB General Manager and host of the popular show *Be My Guest*) and **Tseng Pei Kun** (his agent, representing Idea Empire Advertising & Production Company Limited, or IEAP). Olympian City (OC), a shopping mall operator, collaborated with TVB to produce a New Year’s Eve Countdown show. OC separately arranged for Chan to appear in a live *Be My Guest* segment during the event, paying IEAP $160,000 (of which Chan received $112,000). Chan did not seek TVB’s permission for this outside engagement, violating his employment contract. The prosecution charged both appellants under **section 9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO)**, alleging that Chan accepted $112,000 as an inducement to perform an act *in relation to TVB’s affairs or business* (i.e., hosting the *Be My Guest* segment as part of TVB’s broadcast). The trial judge acquitted them, but the Court of Appeal overturned the verdict, holding that Chan’s act *related to TVB’s business*. The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) unanimously allowed the appeals, quashing the convictions, ruling that the prosecution failed to prove Chan’s act was *adverse to TVB’s interests*—a necessary element under section 9.  

---

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties  
**Prosecution’s Argument**:  
- Chan’s appearance in the *Be My Guest* segment was *in relation to TVB’s affairs or business* because:  
  (a) The segment was part of a TVB-produced Countdown show;  
  (b) TVB had agreed to include the segment (as it boosted audience ratings);  
  (c) Chan’s refusal would have harmed TVB’s contractual relationship with OC and audience ratings.  
- The Court of Appeal held that the phrase *“in relation to his principal’s affairs or business”* required only that the act *related to* the principal’s business (not that it be detrimental), citing *Ch’ng Poh* and *Fung Hok Cheung*.  
- The prosecution argued that Chan’s act was *aimed at* TVB (as TVB benefited), so section 9 applied.  

**Defendants’ Argument**:  
- Chan’s act was *not* *in relation to TVB’s affairs or business* because:  
  (a) He was acting as a *celebrity* (not in his capacity as TVB’s agent);  
  (b) TVB *benefited* from his appearance (no conflict of interest);  
  (c) The act was *not intended to influence or harm* TVB’s interests.  
- The trial judge and CFA majority held that section 9 requires the agent’s act to *undermine the integrity of the agency relationship* (i.e., be *detrimental* to the principal). Since TVB gained from the act, it was not a section 9 offence.  
- Tang PJ (dissenting) argued that Chan’s act *was* related to TVB’s business but that he had a *reasonable excuse* (TVB implicitly consented to his appearance).  

---

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The **core legal issue** was the interpretation of *“in relation to his principal’s affairs or business”* under **section 9 of POBO**, which criminalizes agents accepting advantages as inducements for acts *in relation to* their principal’s business. The CFA, in a **unanimous but split-reasoning decision**, clarified that this phrase requires the agent’s act to be **intended to influence or affect the principal’s affairs in a manner that undermines the agency relationship**—i.e., **detrimental to the principal’s interests**. This was the **novel and controversial** point, as the Court of Appeal had erroneously held that *any* act related to the principal’s business (even if beneficial) sufficed.  

#### **Key Legal Principles**  
**1. The “Adverse Impact” Requirement**:  
The CFA held that **section 9 does not criminalize all acts related to the principal’s business** but only those **intended to harm the principal’s interests**. This interpretation aligns with the **mischief of the ordinance**: to prevent corruption that *undermines the fiduciary relationship* between agent and principal. As Ribeiro PJ stated:  
> *“The induced or rewarded conduct ‘aimed at the principal’s business’ has to be conduct which subverts the integrity of the agency relationship to the detriment of the principal’s interests.”*  

The Court rejected the Court of Appeal’s reasoning that *“influence or affect”* could be *beneficial* (e.g., boosting TVB’s audience ratings). Instead, it emphasized that **legislative intent**—to criminalize *corrupt* transactions that harm the principal—requires **detriment**. The Privy Council in *Ch’ng Poh* had clarified that the phrase *“in relation to his principal’s affairs”* means the act must be *“aimed at”* the principal, but the CFA added that *“aimed at”* implies **intentional harm**, not mere connection.  

**2. Distinguishing *Ch’ng Poh* and *Fung Hok Cheung***:  
- ***Ch’ng Poh* (1997)**: The Privy Council held that section 9 requires the agent’s act to be *“aimed at”* the principal (e.g., bribing a solicitor to secure a benefit *at the firm’s expense*). The CFA clarified that *Ch’ng Poh* did not mean *any* act related to the principal’s business suffices; it required **intentional harm**.  
- ***Fung Hok Cheung* (2008)**: The Court of Appeal had held that *“influence or affect”* need not be *adverse* (e.g., reputational harm sufficed). The CFA distinguished this by noting that *Fung* involved **actual detriment** (reputational harm to the trainer), whereas here, **no detriment occurred**. The CFA stressed that *Fung* did not establish that *beneficial* acts could be criminalized.  

**3. Mens Rea and the Role of “Corruptly”**:  
The CFA clarified that **removing “corruptly” from section 9 (in 1970)** did *not* mean the offence applies to *any* payment without consent. Instead, the prosecution must prove:  
- The advantage was provided as an **inducement for an act intended to harm the principal** (for the agent’s acceptance);  
- The agent **knew** the advantage was provided for such an act.  
The Attorney General’s 1970 remarks (that the Crown need only prove *“a payment to the agent”*) were **misinterpreted** by the Court of Appeal. The CFA held that the statute still requires **qualitative assessment** of the payment’s purpose (i.e., whether it was for a *harmful* act).  

**4. The “Reasonable Excuse” Defense**:  
The CFA held that **reasonable excuse is irrelevant** here because the prosecution failed to prove the act was *within section 9* (i.e., detrimental). Tang PJ argued that Chan had a reasonable excuse (TVB implicitly consented), but the majority (Ribeiro and Fok PJ) ruled that **no reasonable excuse analysis was needed** since the act was *not* a section 9 offence. The Court emphasized that **section 9’s scope is limited to acts harming the principal**—not all outside dealings.  

**5. Legislative History and Purpose**:  
The CFA anchored its reasoning in the **long title of POBO**: *“to make further and better provision for the prevention of bribery.”* The ordinance targets **secret commissions** (e.g., agents pocketing payments without the principal’s knowledge), not *all* outside earnings. The Court cited *Parker v McKenna* (1874), which established that **agents cannot profit without the principal’s consent**, but **only if the act harms the principal**. The CFA rejected the idea that *any* undisclosed payment is criminal:  
> *“The acceptance of a payment to favour one of two equal competitors is no less an offence under s 9. But as Lawton LJ said, the mischief aimed at is to prevent agents being put in positions of temptation.”*  

**6. Distinction Between Section 9 and Section 4**:  
Section 4 (for public servants) requires the act to be *“in his capacity as a public servant,”* but section 9 requires the act to be *“in relation to his principal’s affairs.”* The CFA stressed that **section 9 is not a mirror of section 4**—it focuses on **harm to the principal**, not the agent’s *capacity*. Thus, a public servant (like Chan) could be prosecuted under section 4 for *acting in their capacity*, but here, the prosecution chose section 9 (for private agents), which requires **detriment**.  

---

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects  
1. **Beneficial Act, Not Harmful**: The most striking feature is that **TVB *benefited* from Chan’s appearance** (higher audience ratings, no cost to TVB). The prosecution sought to criminalize a *beneficial* act, which the CFA rightly rejected. This highlights the **narrow scope of section 9**: it targets *corruption that harms the principal*, not *all* outside earnings.  

2. **Celebrity Context**: The case involved a **real-world TV personality** (*Be My Guest* was a genuine show), making the legal principles relatable. The Court’s focus on *celebrity status* (Chan acting as a “celebrity,” not as TVB’s agent) underscored the **practical limits of section 9**—it does not criminalize *all* side gigs, only those *harmful* to the principal.  

3. **Legislative History Nuance**: The CFA’s detailed analysis of the **1970 removal of “corruptly”** from POBO (to avoid proving *corrupt motive*) revealed a **misunderstanding in lower courts**. The Attorney General’s remarks were **misinterpreted** to mean *any* payment without consent is criminal, but the CFA clarified that **qualitative assessment remains essential**.  

4. **Split in Reasoning, Unanimous Outcome**: The CFA had **three distinct judgments** (Ribeiro, Tang, and Fok), but all agreed the convictions must be quashed. Ribeiro and Fok held the act was *not within section 9* (no detriment), while Tang held it *was* within section 9 but *excused* (TVB consented). This **demonstrates judicial rigor** in avoiding overreach.  

5. **Rejection of “Hypothetical Harm”**: The Court of Appeal argued that Chan’s refusal would have *harmed* TVB (e.g., requiring alternative programming). The CFA **rejected this**, stressing that **intent to harm** (not hypothetical consequences) is required. This prevents *prosecutions based on speculative harm*.  

6. **Global Relevance**: The case aligns with **UNCAC (United Nations Convention against Corruption)**, which focuses on **conduct undermining agency integrity** (not just secret payments). The CFA’s emphasis on *detriment* reflects **international anti-corruption norms**, making it a **landmark interpretation** for common law jurisdictions.  

In summary, *Secretary for Justice v. Chan Chi Wan* is **remarkable for its principled limitation of section 9** to *harmful* acts, its rejection of overbroad prosecutions, and its nuanced engagement with legislative intent. It ensures that **anti-corruption law does not criminalize beneficial conduct**, preserving the integrity of the agency relationship without stifling legitimate side work. [end of text]
