Okay, here’s a breakdown of the *Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v Chan Chun Chuen and Another* case, addressing the three requested sections with a detailed and thorough response:

**1. Summary of the Facts**

The case revolves around a will dispute following the death of Nina Wang, a Hong Kong businesswoman and philanthropist.  Nina Wang had two wills: a 2002 will naming the Chinachem Charitable Foundation as the sole beneficiary, and a 2006 will naming the Applicant, Chan Chun Chuen, as the sole beneficiary. The Foundation challenged the validity of the 2006 will, arguing it was a forgery.  A trial took place, with Lam J finding the 2006 will to be a forgery. The Applicant appealed this decision to the Court of Appeal, which upheld Lam J’s ruling. The Applicant then sought leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal, arguing that the appeal involved a question of “great general or public importance.” The Court of Final Appeal dismissed this application, concluding that the appeal did not meet the criteria for leave. The core dispute centers on whether the 2006 will was genuinely authored by Nina Wang or a forgery, and whether the Court of Appeal’s finding was sufficiently robust to warrant further review.



**2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties**

*   **The Foundation (Respondent):** The Foundation argued that the 2006 will was a forgery and that the appeal to the Court of Final Appeal was without merit. They contended that the Court of Appeal’s decision was well-supported by the evidence and that granting leave to appeal would be an unnecessary and oppressive intrusion into the proceedings.  They emphasized the established practice of final appellate courts declining to review concurrent findings of fact made by lower courts, particularly when those findings are supported by substantial evidence. They argued that the appeal was not of “great general or public importance” and that it would serve no legitimate purpose to revisit the factual determination.  They specifically highlighted inconsistencies in the Applicant’s evidence and the lack of any compelling reason to overturn the Court of Appeal’s judgment.

*   **The Applicant (Appellant):** The Applicant sought leave to appeal, arguing that the case involved a question of “great general or public importance” and that the Court of Appeal’s decision was flawed. He contended that the Court of Appeal’s review of the factual findings was inadequate and that the Court of Final Appeal should intervene to correct any errors.  He attempted to bolster his argument by pointing to discrepancies in the evidence presented by the witnesses, particularly Winfield Wong, a key attesting witness, and arguing that these discrepancies warranted a fresh examination of the facts. He also invoked the precedent set in *China Field Ltd v Appeal Tribunal (Buildings)* and *WLK v TMC* regarding the scope of appeals as of right.  He argued that the case involved a significant question of property rights and that the Court of Final Appeal had a duty to ensure that the matter was properly resolved.



**3. Summary of the Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The Court of Final Appeal’s decision hinged on a careful interpretation of section 22(1)(a) of the Court’s statute and established legal precedent, particularly concerning appeals as of right and the review of concurrent findings of fact. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

*   **Narrow Interpretation of Section 22(1)(a):** The Court firmly adhered to a narrow interpretation of section 22(1)(a), particularly the second limb. It emphasized that appeals as of right are exceptionally rare and should only be granted in cases involving genuine errors of law or a miscarriage of justice. The Court recognized that the primary function of a final appellate court is to determine points of law of general public importance, not to re-examine factual findings.

*   **The “As of Right” Exception – A Historical Context:** The Court highlighted the historical context of appeals as of right, noting that most major Commonwealth jurisdictions have moved away from this practice. It acknowledged that the practice stemmed from the pre-1997 Privy Council jurisdiction and that the public interest strongly favored abandoning it.

*   **The “Concurrent Findings” Doctrine:** The Court reaffirmed the established doctrine that final appellate courts should not review concurrent findings of fact made by lower courts unless there is evidence of a miscarriage of justice or a clear error. This doctrine is rooted in the principle of judicial deference to the expertise and experience of lower courts in assessing factual evidence. The Court cited *Sky Heart Ltd v Lee Hysan Estate Co Ltd* as the cornerstone of this principle.

*   **The “Great General or Public Importance” Test:** The Court rigorously applied the “great general or public importance” test, concluding that the appeal did not meet the threshold. It emphasized that the case primarily concerned a dispute over a will and property rights, which, while significant, did not rise to the level of a matter of general public importance. The Court rejected the Applicant’s argument that the case involved a novel legal issue.

*   **The “Or Otherwise” Ground – A Limited Exception:** The Court acknowledged the “or otherwise” ground, which allows for discretionary leave to be granted if the case involves a question that “otherwise ought to be submitted to the Court for decision.” However, it held that this ground is narrowly construed and should only be invoked in exceptional circumstances.

*   **The “Partial Will” Issue:** The Court addressed the crucial issue of whether the 2006 will was a “partial will” (i.e., a will that only dealt with a portion of the estate). It found that the Court of Appeal’s determination that the will was a forgery was well-supported by the evidence and that the Applicant had failed to demonstrate any basis for overturning this finding. The Court emphasized that the issue of whether the will was a partial or complete will was a matter of construction and not a question of fact.

*   **The Significance of Winfield Wong’s Testimony:** The Court carefully scrutinized Winfield Wong’s testimony, recognizing that he was a key witness in the case. However, it found that the discrepancies in his testimony were not significant enough to warrant a review of the Court of Appeal’s findings. The Court noted that the inconsistencies were largely attributable to the fact that Mr. Wong had forgotten details of the events surrounding the execution of the will.

*   **The Importance of Deference to Lower Courts:** The Court underscored the principle of judicial deference to lower courts in assessing factual evidence. It emphasized that final appellate courts should not substitute their own judgment for that of lower courts, particularly when the lower courts have a more thorough understanding of the local context and the evidence presented.

**Novel or Controversial Points:**

*   **Re-evaluating the “As of Right” Practice:** The Court’s decision implicitly raises questions about the continued relevance of the “as of right” practice in appeals to the Court of Final Appeal. The Court’s observation that most major Commonwealth jurisdictions have abandoned this practice suggests that Hong Kong should consider following suit.

*   **The Scope of Judicial Deference:** The case highlights the extent of judicial deference that should be afforded to lower courts in reviewing factual findings. The Court’s reaffirmation of the “concurrent findings” doctrine reinforces the principle that final appellate courts should not readily overturn the findings of lower courts, even if there are discrepancies in the evidence.

*   **The Application of the “Great General or Public Importance” Test:** The Court’s rigorous application of the “great general or public importance” test demonstrates the difficulty of meeting this threshold in property disputes. The Court’s conclusion that the case did not involve a matter of general public importance reinforces the principle that final appellate courts should focus on issues of broader public concern.
