Okay, I need to tackle this case summary. Let me start by understanding the case. The appellant, W, is a post-operative male-to-female transsexual who wants to marry a man. The Registrar of Marriages refuses, saying she isn't legally recognized as a woman under Hong Kong's Marriage Ordinance. W challenges this, arguing she should be considered a woman for marriage purposes. The Court of Appeal dismissed her appeal, but she got leave to appeal to the High Court.

Now, the legal issues. The main question is whether the statutory definitions of "woman" and "female" in the Marriage Ordinance and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance include transsexuals. The Registrar argues that the Corbett case established that biological criteria determine sex for marriage, so transsexuals aren't included. W argues that the law should evolve to recognize acquired gender, citing international trends and human rights.

The Court's decision was split. The majority allowed the appeal, saying the Registrar's interpretation was unconstitutional. They held that the law must recognize transsexuals as women for marriage purposes, requiring a remedial interpretation. The minority dissented, arguing that the law should not change without legislative action and that the traditional concept of marriage should be upheld.

Legal principles: The case hinges on statutory interpretation and constitutional rights. The majority emphasized the need to update laws to reflect societal changes and protect human dignity, citing the European Court of Human Rights' Goodwin decision. The minority stressed the importance of legislative process and the margin of appreciation. Novelty lies in the Court's willingness to reinterpret statutes for constitutional compliance, even without legislative action.

Striking aspects: The case highlights the tension between traditional legal interpretations and evolving societal norms. The Court's decision to allow a remedial interpretation rather than striking down the law shows a balance between judicial activism and respecting legislative intent. Also, the detailed medical and social context provided underscores the complexity of transsexual issues in legal frameworks.

### 1. Summary of the Facts

The appellant, W, is a post-operative male-to-female transsexual who underwent sex reassignment surgery and is legally recognized as female for purposes such as identity cards and passports. She seeks to marry her male partner but is denied this right by the Registrar of Marriages, who interprets the Marriage Ordinance and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance to exclude transsexuals from being recognized as "women" or "female" for marriage purposes. W challenges this decision, arguing that she should be recognized as a woman under the law. The Registrar contends that statutory definitions of "woman" and "female" are based on biological criteria, as established in the Corbett case. The Court of Appeal dismissed W's appeal, but she obtained leave to appeal to the High Court, leading to a divided decision.
