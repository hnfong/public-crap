Okay, let's tackle this case. The user provided a detailed legal judgment from Hong Kong regarding the constitutionality of public procession regulations. The task is to summarize the facts, arguments, legal principles, and any remarkable aspects.

First, the facts: The case involves a public procession in Hong Kong that didn't comply with notification requirements. The organizers were convicted under the Public Order Ordinance. The appeal challenges the constitutionality of the Ordinance's provisions, particularly the discretion of the Commissioner to restrict assemblies under "public order."

Next, the arguments. The appellants argue that the concept of "public order" is too vague and violates the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. They claim it's an unconstitutional restriction on freedom of assembly. The respondents argue that the Ordinance is necessary for public safety and that the concept of public order is sufficiently defined under international law.

For the legal principles, the court discusses the constitutional requirements for restricting fundamental rights, including the necessity of a proportionality test. The key points are the "prescribed by law" requirement and the necessity requirement. The court distinguishes between constitutional and statutory interpretations of "public order," noting that the latter is too vague and thus unconstitutional. The severance of "public order" from "public order (ordre public)" is a novel approach to save parts of the statute.

Remarkable aspects include the detailed analysis of the proportionality test and the emphasis on the need for legal certainty in restricting fundamental rights. The case also highlights the tension between public safety and individual freedoms, showing how courts balance these interests.

I need to ensure the summary covers all these points clearly, with a focus on the legal principles and the novel approach of severance. Also, note any unusual aspects, like the extensive jurisprudence cited and the detailed reasoning on proportionality.

### 1. Summary of the Facts  
The case revolves around a public procession held on 10 February 2002 in Hong Kong, organized to protest the conviction of an activist for assaulting a police officer. The procession, which began at Chater Garden and proceeded to Police Headquarters, consisted of approximately 96 participants. It did not comply with the statutory notification requirements under the Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245). The organizers were subsequently convicted of holding an unauthorized assembly, and the appellants appealed the conviction, challenging the constitutionality of the Ordinance's provisions regulating public processions. The core issue centered on whether the Commissioner of Police's discretion to restrict assemblies under the purpose of "public order (ordre public)" satisfied constitutional requirements for restricting fundamental rights.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments  
**Appellants' Arguments:**  
The appellants contended that the Ordinance's provisions, particularly the Commissioner's discretion to restrict assemblies under "public order (ordre public)," were unconstitutional. They argued that the concept of "public order" was overly vague and imprecise, failing to meet the "prescribed by law" requirement under Article 39(2) of the Basic Law and Article 17 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights (BORO). They emphasized that such vagueness rendered the restrictions arbitrary and incompatible with the fundamental right to peaceful assembly, which is guaranteed under Article 27 of the Basic Law. The appellants also argued that the Ordinance's prior notification requirements and criminal sanctions for non-compliance were disproportionate and infringed on their freedom of assembly.  

**Respondents' Arguments:**  
The Government defended the Ordinance, asserting that it was necessary to balance public safety and order with individual freedoms. They argued that "public order (ordre public)" was a constitutionally recognized legitimate purpose for restricting assemblies and that the Ordinance incorporated international standards, such as those under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The respondents emphasized that the Ordinance's provisions were reasonable and necessary to prevent public disorder, protect public safety, and ensure the smooth functioning of society. They also highlighted the importance of prior notification in enabling the police to plan and manage public gatherings effectively.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The case established several key legal principles regarding the regulation of fundamental rights, particularly the right to peaceful assembly:  

**Constitutional Requirements for Restrictions:**  
- **Prescribed by Law:** Restrictions on fundamental rights must comply with the "prescribed by law" requirement, which mandates that laws be sufficiently clear and precise to enable individuals to understand their obligations. The court emphasized that vague concepts like "public order (ordre public)" fail this test, as they lack the certainty required to protect constitutional rights.  
- **Necessity Requirement:** Restrictions must be "necessary in a democratic society" and satisfy a proportionality test. This involves ensuring that the restriction is rationally connected to a legitimate purpose (e.g., public safety or order) and no more than necessary to achieve that purpose. The court applied this test rigorously, requiring that restrictions be narrowly tailored and proportionate to the threat posed.  

**Proportionality Test:**  
The court adopted a multi-step proportionality analysis:  
1. **Rational Connection:** The restriction must be rationally linked to a legitimate purpose (e.g., preventing public disorder).  
2. **Necessity:** The measure must be no more than required to achieve the purpose.  
The court stressed that prior restraint, such as the Commissioner's power to prohibit or impose conditions on assemblies, must be exercised only when less restrictive alternatives (e.g., post-event policing) are insufficient.  

**Severance Doctrine:**  
A novel and significant aspect of the judgment was the court's application of the severance doctrine. It held that the unconstitutional part of the Ordinance ("public order (ordre public)") could be severed from the constitutionally valid part ("public order"), preserving the latter while striking down the former. This approach allowed the Ordinance to retain its core regulatory framework while addressing constitutional deficiencies.  

**Freedom of Assembly and Positive Duties:**  
The court acknowledged the positive duty of the Government to facilitate lawful assemblies, emphasizing that restrictions must not unduly hinder the exercise of this fundamental right. It also highlighted the importance of balancing individual freedoms with societal interests, such as public safety, but cautioned against overly broad or vague restrictions.  

**International Law and Constitutional Incorporation:**  
The court affirmed that Hong Kong's constitutional framework incorporates international human rights standards, such as those in the ICCPR, and that domestic laws must align with these principles. However, it cautioned against uncritically adopting international terminology without ensuring sufficient clarity and specificity.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects  
- **Detailed Proportionality Analysis:** The case represents one of the most comprehensive applications of the proportionality test in Hong Kong's constitutional jurisprudence, reflecting the court's commitment to protecting fundamental rights while accommodating legitimate state interests.  
- **Severance Doctrine:** The use of severance to salvage parts of an otherwise unconstitutional statute is a relatively uncommon but pragmatic approach that preserves legislative intent while upholding constitutional principles.  
- **Emphasis on Legal Certainty:** The judgment underscores the importance of clarity in laws restricting fundamental rights, highlighting the tension between vague discretionary powers and the need for judicial review to protect individual freedoms.  
- **Historical Context:** The case reflects Hong Kong's evolving approach to balancing civil liberties with public order, particularly in the post-handover era, and demonstrates the judiciary's role in safeguarding constitutional rights against potential abuses of executive power.  
- **Impact on Public Assembly Laws:** The decision has significant implications for the regulation of public processions and meetings in Hong Kong, potentially influencing future legislative reforms to ensure compliance with constitutional standards. [end of text]
