### 1. Summary of Facts

On October 15, 2014, during the "Occupy Central" protests in Hong Kong, a group of seven serving police officers (the appellants) were involved in the arrest and subsequent treatment of a protestor, Tsang Kin Chiu ("Tsang"). After a struggle at a planter where Tsang splashed liquid on officers, he was subdued, handcuffed, and frogmarched by a Quick Response Team (QRT) unit. The prosecution alleged that the officers then carried Tsang face-down to a nearby substation, threw him to the ground, and subjected him to a sustained assault involving kicking and stamping. Later, at Central Police Station, one officer (D5) allegedly slapped Tsang in an interview room.

The prosecution's case relied heavily on "open source" video footage and photographs downloaded from the internet (broadcast by TVB, ATV, Now TV, and Apple Daily) and CCTV footage from the police station. The original video tapes held by the news agencies were not produced at trial due to a prior refusal by a lower court to grant a Production Order compelling their release. The trial judge admitted the downloaded copies, finding them authentic based on witness testimony from news agencies, the victim's identification of himself in the footage, and the consistency of the video with police testimony.

Seven police officers were convicted. Five (D1, D2, D3, D5, D6) were convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (Charge 1) and sentenced to two years' imprisonment. D5 was additionally convicted of common assault (Charge 2) for the incident in the interview room. D4 and D7 were also convicted of Charge 1. All appellants appealed their convictions and sentences.

### 2. Summary of Arguments

**Appellants' Arguments:**
*   **Admissibility Standard:** The trial judge applied the wrong legal test for admissibility. They argued that the prosecution must prove the authenticity of the video evidence on the "balance of probabilities" before it could be admitted, rather than establishing a *prima facie* case.
*   **Authenticity and Tampering:** The defence argued there was insufficient evidence to prove the videos were not tampered with, edited, or doctored, especially since the original tapes were not produced and the cameramen were not called. They contended the videos were unreliable due to poor quality and "blocked shots."
*   **Identification:** For D4 and D7 specifically, the defence argued there was no identification evidence linking them to the assault. D4 was not a member of the specific QRT unit, and neither D4 nor D7 was identified by any witness in the footage. The defence argued the trial judge's own visual identification of them was unsafe and lacked a proper foundation.
*   **Sentencing:** The appellants argued the sentences were manifestly excessive, citing the stress of the protests, their long service records, and the fact that D1 and D2 were merely "watching" rather than physically assaulting Tsang.

**Respondent's (Prosecution) Arguments:**
*   **Admissibility Standard:** The prosecution argued that the correct test is whether there is a *prima facie* case of authenticity sufficient to allow the evidence to be considered by the fact-finder. The ultimate question of authenticity and weight is for the jury (or judge in a summary trial).
*   **Authenticity:** The prosecution submitted that the videos were authenticated through a combination of witness testimony from news agencies regarding their broadcast and storage processes, the victim's identification of himself, and the consistency of the footage with police testimony. They argued the videos were not tampered with.
*   **Identification:** For D4 and D7, the prosecution argued that circumstantial evidence (team membership, location, and the presence of a seventh officer) was sufficient to prove their involvement, even without direct witness identification in the footage.
*   **Sentencing:** The prosecution argued that police officers breaking the law they are sworn to uphold must be severely punished to maintain public confidence. They contended all participants were equally culpable in the joint enterprise and that the sentences were appropriate.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**The Standard of Proof for Admissibility of Video Evidence**
A central legal principle established in this case concerns the threshold for admitting video recordings and photographs in criminal trials. The Court of Final Appeal (via the Court of Appeal) clarified that the trial judge does not need to be satisfied that the evidence is authentic on the "balance of probabilities" as a condition of admissibility. Instead, the correct test, following *HKSAR v Lee Chi Fai* and *R v Murphy*, is whether the prosecution has established a *prima facie* case of authenticity. This requires evidence that defines and describes the provenance and history of the recording up to the moment of production in court. If a *prima facie* case is made out, the evidence is admissible. The ultimate question of whether the evidence is authentic and reliable enough to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt is a matter of weight for the fact-finder (jury or judge), not a preliminary hurdle for the judge to clear at the admissibility stage. The Court explicitly rejected the argument that the standard of "balance of probabilities" applies at the admissibility stage, noting that such a view misinterprets the leading authority of *R v Robson*.

**Authentication of "Open Source" and Secondary Evidence**
The case provides significant guidance on how to authenticate video evidence that is not the original recording held by the creator (e.g., news agencies) but rather copies downloaded from the internet. The Court affirmed that authenticity can be proved circumstantially. It is not strictly necessary to call the original cameraman if other evidence logically probates the authenticity of the recording. In this instance, the Court found that the authenticity of the "open source" footage was sufficiently established by:
1.  **Witness Testimony:** Evidence from news agency staff regarding the technical process of recording, storing, and broadcasting the footage (e.g., TVB witnesses confirming the footage was burned to discs without editing).
2.  **Victim Identification:** The victim, Tsang, identified himself in the footage and confirmed the sequence of events depicted matched his recollection.
3.  **Corroboration:** The footage was consistent with the testimony of police officers and other independent evidence (such as police CCTV).
The Court held that where a central participant in the event can identify themselves and the sequence of events in the footage, this alone can often establish a *prima facie* basis for authenticity, which is then bolstered by technical evidence.

**Identification of Defendants from Video Evidence**
The Court elaborated on the principles of identification when a defendant is not identified by a witness in the footage but is identified by the trial judge through visual comparison.
*   **Foundation Required:** For a judge to make an identification of a defendant from video footage, there must be a "sure yardstick" or foundation. This usually requires an earlier identification of the defendant by a witness in the same footage or photographs, establishing their presence and appearance at the scene *before* the specific incident in question.
*   **The "Edifice" Principle:** The Court emphasized that a judge's identification cannot stand alone if there is no prior identification by a witness to serve as a foundation. In the case of D4 and D7, the Court quashed their convictions because neither had been identified by any witness in the footage prior to the assault. The trial judge's own visual identification of them at the scene, without a prior "anchor" point (such as a witness identifying them earlier in the video), was deemed unsafe. The Court stated, "An edifice may be meticulously and attractively built, yet if it lacks proper foundations it is a dangerous construction."
*   **Circumstantial Inference:** While the Court accepted that circumstantial evidence (such as team membership and the presence of a seventh officer) could support an inference of guilt, it must be strong enough to exclude reasonable doubt. In the absence of any identification evidence linking D4 and D7 to the group before the assault, the circumstantial evidence was deemed too tenuous to sustain a conviction.

**Sentencing of Police Officers**
The Court reaffirmed the principle that police officers who break the law they are sworn to uphold must be punished severely to maintain public confidence and deter others. However, the Court also recognized the unique pressures faced by officers during large-scale civil disorder. While the starting point for sentencing was high, the Court found the original sentence of two years to be manifestly excessive for some appellants, particularly those who were not the primary physical aggressors. The Court adjusted the sentences to reflect the varying degrees of culpability, reducing the terms for D1, D2, D3, D5, and D6, while setting aside the convictions and sentences for D4 and D7 entirely.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

**The "Open Source" Evidence Dilemma:**
One of the most remarkable aspects of this case is the reliance on "open source" video footage (downloaded from the internet) as the primary evidence for a serious criminal conviction involving police brutality. The prosecution could not produce the original tapes because a lower court had refused a Production Order to compel the news agencies to release them. This created a unique evidentiary landscape where the court had to determine the authenticity of digital copies without access to the originals or the original cameramen, relying instead on the victim's identification and technical testimony from news agencies. This highlights the growing challenge of modern criminal trials where the "best evidence" is often held by third parties (like media corporations) who may refuse to cooperate.

**The "Seventh Officer" Mystery:**
The case hinged on a specific, almost cinematic detail: the video footage showed six officers carrying Tsang initially, but seven officers were present at the substation when the assault occurred. The prosecution's case against D7 rested almost entirely on the inference that he must have been the "seventh" officer who joined the group. The Court's decision to quash D7's conviction because there was no witness identification of him in the footage underscores the strictness of the law regarding identification evidence. It is striking that a conviction based on the logic of "there were seven people, and you were the only one missing from the earlier count" was deemed insufficient without a direct link to the footage.

**The Role of the Victim as the "Silent Witness":**
The case is unusual in that the victim, Tsang, played a dual role. He was the complainant alleging assault, but he was also the primary witness who authenticated the video evidence by identifying himself in it. The Court noted that his evidence was crucial in bridging the gap between the "open source" footage and the specific events of the night. Without his ability to say, "That is me being carried," the authenticity of the videos might have been far more difficult to establish.

**Judicial Self-Identification and its Limits:**
The case provides a stark warning about the limits of a judge's ability to identify a defendant from video footage. The trial judge had spent 31 days watching the footage and felt confident in identifying D4 and D7. However, the Court of Appeal overturned these convictions, emphasizing that a judge's personal observation cannot replace the need for a witness identification to serve as a foundation. This distinction between "seeing" a defendant in a video and "identifying" them legally is a crucial, yet often overlooked, nuance in criminal procedure.

**The "Blocked Shot" and Editing:**
The defense's argument regarding a "blocked shot" (a 49-second gap in the TVB footage where the camera was obscured) was a significant point of contention. The defense argued this gap allowed for the possibility of editing or substitution of the footage. The Court's detailed analysis of how the footage was broadcast live and stored without editing, combined with the victim's testimony, effectively neutralized this argument, demonstrating how technical evidence can overcome suspicions of tampering in the digital age.
