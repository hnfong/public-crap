Okay, the user wants a summary of every section in this bill, starting with Sec. 90001. They specified that each section should have at most one paragraph with up to four sentences, being specific about parties, entities, and quantities. Let me go through each section carefully.

First, Sec. 90001 is about border infrastructure and the wall system. The appropriation is $46.55 billion for fiscal year 2025, available until 2029. It covers construction, access roads, technology, and ground preparation for CBP. I need to mention the entities involved, like the Commissioner of CBP, and the specific uses of funds.

Next, Sec. 90002 deals with CBP personnel, vehicles, and facilities. There's $4.1 billion for hiring and training agents, $2.05 billion for bonuses, $855 million for vehicles, and $5 billion for facilities. The restriction about not hiring processing coordinators after 2028 is important. I should note the amounts and the entities affected.

Sec. 90003 is about detention capacity. $45 billion for single adult and family detention. The standards are set by the Secretary of Homeland Security. I need to clarify that this includes family residential centers and the duration of detention.

Sec. 90004 covers border security technology and screening. $6.168 billion for tech procurement, AI, surveillance upgrades, and biometric systems. Restrictions on surveillance towers without testing are key. Mentioning the specific technologies and the entities involved is necessary.

Sec. 90005 is state and local assistance. $500 million for UAS detection, $625 million for the 2026 World Cup, $1 billion for the 2028 Olympics, and $450 million for Operation Stonegarden. The State Border Security Fund has $10 billion for border projects. I should highlight the different grants and their purposes.

Sec. 90006 is for presidential residence protection. $300 million for law enforcement costs. Conditions include costs incurred after 2024 and being directly attributable to protection. Mentioning the entities and the availability period is important.

Sec. 90007 is for DHS border support. $10 billion for reimbursement of costs. This is a general fund for border activities, so I need to note the amount and the purpose.

Moving to Subtitle B, Sec. 90101 is about FEHB improvements. Regulations for verifying qualifying life events, fraud assessments, audits, and disenrollment processes. The funding amendment adds $66 million for audits. Specific details about the Office of Personnel Management and the timelines are crucial.

Sec. 90102 is the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee funding. $88 million for fiscal year 2026. Amendments to the CARES Act include additional acts and extend the period to 2034. Mentioning the committee and the specific act amendments is necessary.

Finally, Sec. 90103 is an appropriation for OMB. $100 million for budget and accounting efficiencies in the executive branch. I should note the entity (OMB) and the purpose of the funds.

I need to ensure each summary is concise, specific, and within the sentence limit. Avoid any vague terms and include all significant details like amounts, entities, and timeframes. Check that each section starts with the correct number and flows logically. Make sure there are no markdown formats and that the language is clear and direct.
