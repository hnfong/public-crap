Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a detailed bill text and wants a summary of each section "Sec. XXXX" with specific requirements. First, I need to make sure I understand exactly what they're asking for. They mentioned starting with Sec. 80001 and going through each section, giving at most one paragraph of four sentences, being specific with parties, entities, and quantities.

Wait, the bill is titled as a huge bill championed by President Trump, but the user says it's passed by Congress recently. Wait, but Trump is a former president, and the bill is dated 2025. Hmm, that's a bit confusing because Trump isn't in office now. Maybe it's a hypothetical or a typo, but I should focus on the content as given.

First, I need to go through each section listed in the bill. The user provided the table of contents, so I can see all the sections. Let me list them out: Sec. 80001, 81001, 82001, 82002, 82003, 82004, 82005, 83001, 83002, 83003, 83004, 84001, 85001, 85002, 86001, 87001.

Wait, the user said "for every section 'Sec. XXXX' in the Bill," so I need to go through each of these. The example they gave starts with Sec. 80001, so I should follow that order.

Let me start with Sec. 80001. The section is titled "Exemption of Certain Assets." The amendment is to Section 480(f)(2) of the Higher Education Act. The key changes are adding exemptions for family farms, small businesses with up to 100 employees, and commercial fishing businesses. The effective date is July 1, 2026, for award year 2026-2027. I need to be specific: the exemptions are for family farms where the family resides, small businesses with ≤100 FTE employees owned by the family, and commercial fishing businesses with related expenses. The effective date is July 1, 2026, applying to award year 2026-2027. So the summary should mention the specific exemptions, the effective date, and the applicable award year.

Next, Sec. 81001: Establishment of loan limits for graduate and professional students and parent borrowers; termination of graduate and professional PLUS loans. The key points here are the termination of interest-subsidized loans for grad/prof students after July 1, 2012, but with a transition period until June 30, 2026. Then, starting July 1, 2026, the annual limits for unsubsidized Stafford loans: $20,500 for grad students (not professional), $50,000 for professional students. Aggregate limits: $100,000 for grad students not professional, $200,000 minus prior borrowing for those who were professional. Parent PLUS loans: annual limit $20,000 per dependent student, aggregate $65,000. Lifetime limit for all loans: $257,500. Also, an interim exception for students enrolled as of June 30, 2026, with a 3-year expected time to credential. Need to specify the numbers and the effective dates.

Sec. 82001: Loan Repayment. This is a big section. The main changes are transitioning to income-based repayment plans by July 1, 2028, eliminating income-contingent repayment plans, and introducing the Repayment Assistance Plan. The Repayment Assistance Plan has specific payment calculations based on adjusted gross income, with a 10% cap for over $100k. Also, termination of income-contingent repayment plans effective July 1, 2028. The Repayment Assistance Plan replaces the previous plans, with terms like 360 qualifying payments for forgiveness. Need to mention the key dates, the new plan details, and the elimination of old plans.

Sec. 82002: Deferment; Forbearance. Sunset of economic hardship and unemployment deferments for loans made on or after July 1, 2027. Forbearance limited to 9 months in any 24-month period for loans made after July 1, 2027. So, effective dates and the new limits.

Sec. 82003: Loan Rehabilitation. Updating rehabilitation limits: two times instead of one time for FFEL and direct loans, and twice for Perkins loans. Effective July 1, 2027. Minimum monthly payment of $10 for loans made after July 1, 2027.

Sec. 82004: Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Adding on-time payments under the Repayment Assistance Plan as eligible for PSLF. So, the new clause (v) in the existing section.

Sec. 82005: Student Loan Servicing. Adding $1 billion for servicing costs, to be available until expended.

Sec. 83001: Eligibility. Adjusting adjusted gross income definition to include foreign income for Pell Grants starting July 1, 2026. Also, a sunset provision for the current eligibility rules. Conforming amendments to remove clauses related to foreign income.

Sec. 83002: Workforce Pell Grants. Creating a new program for workforce grants, requiring programs to be 150-600 clock hours, 8-15 weeks, approved by the state governor, with specific criteria like job placement rates and earnings. Effective July 1, 2026.

Sec. 83003: Pell Shortfall. Increasing the Pell shortfall from $2.17 billion to $12.67 billion.

Sec. 83004: Federal Pell Grant Exclusion. Prohibiting Pell Grants if non-Federal grant aid equals or exceeds cost of attendance, starting July 1, 2026.

Sec. 84001: Ineligibility Based on Low Earning Outcomes. Institutions must comply with new rules; programs with low median earnings (less than 2 of 3 years) lose eligibility. The median earnings are compared to working adults aged 25-34 with relevant education. Requires state data and a 30-cohort minimum.

Sec. 85001: Delay of Rule Relating to Borrower Defense. Delaying borrower defense rules until July 1, 2035, for loans originating before that date. Restoring pre-2020 regulations.

Sec. 85002: Delay of Rule Relating to Closed School Discharges. Similar to 85001, delaying closed school discharge rules until July 1, 2035, restoring pre-2020 regulations.

Sec. 86001: Garden of Heroes. Appropriating $40 million for statues under specific executive orders.

Sec. 87001: Potential Sponsor Vetting. Appropriate $300 million for vetting unaccompanied alien children, with specific uses like background checks, home studies, etc.

Now, I need to make sure each summary is one paragraph, max four sentences, specific with entities and quantities. Let me check each section.

Starting with Sec. 80001: The amendment adds exemptions for family farms, small businesses (≤100 FTE), and commercial fishing businesses. Effective July 1, 2026, for award year 2026-2027. So, the key points are the exemptions, effective date, and applicable award year.

Sec. 81001: Terminates interest-subsidized loans for grad/prof students after July 1, 2012, but with a transition until June 30, 2026. New annual limits: $20,500 for grad (non-prof), $50,000 for professional. Parent PLUS annual $20k, aggregate $65k. Lifetime limit $257,500. Interim exception for students enrolled as of June 30, 2026, with 3-year credential time.

Wait, the user said "be specific as to parties, entities, and quantities." So for Sec. 81001, the parties are graduate and professional students, parent borrowers. Entities: Higher Education Act, Secretary. Quantities: $20,500, $50,000, $20k annual, $65k aggregate, $257,500 lifetime.

Sec. 82001: Transition to Repayment Assistance Plan by July 1, 2028. Eliminates income-contingent repayment. Repayment Assistance Plan has 10% cap on AGI over $100k, 360 payments for forgiveness. Effective July 1, 2026, for new loans.

Wait, the section says "beginning on July 1, 2026, the income-based Repayment Assistance Plan..." So the new plan starts July 1, 2026. The transition to this plan is by July 1, 2028, for existing borrowers. The elimination of income-contingent plans is effective July 1, 2028.

Sec. 82002: Sunset of economic hardship/unemployment deferments for loans made on or after July 1, 2027. Forbearance limited to 9 months in 24 months for loans after July 1, 2027.

Sec. 82003: Loan rehabilitation limits increased to two times (from one) for FFEL and direct loans, and Perkins loans. Minimum monthly payment of $10 for loans made after July 1, 2027.

Sec. 82004: Public Service Loan Forgiveness now includes on-time payments under the Repayment Assistance Plan.

Sec. 82005: $1 billion added for student loan servicing costs, available until expended.

Sec. 83001: Adjusted gross income now includes foreign income for Pell Grant eligibility starting July 1, 2026. Sunset of current rules for academic years before July 1, 2026.

Sec. 83002: Workforce Pell Grants require programs to be 150-600 clock hours, 8-15 weeks, approved by state governor, with 70% completion and job placement rates, and tuition not exceeding value-added earnings. Effective July 1, 2026.

Sec. 83003: Pell shortfall increased from $2.17B to $12.67B.

Sec. 83004: Pell Grants excluded if non-Federal grant aid ≥ cost of attendance, starting July 1, 2026.

Sec. 84001: Institutions must comply with low earning outcomes rules; programs with median earnings below 2 of 3 years' benchmark lose eligibility. Uses Bureau of Census data, 30-cohort minimum.

Sec. 85001: Delay borrower defense rules until July 1, 2035, for loans originating before that date; restore pre-2020 regulations.

Sec. 85002: Similar to 85001, delay closed school discharge rules until July 1, 2035, restore pre-2020 regulations.

Sec. 86001: $40 million for Garden of Heroes statues under specific executive orders.

Sec. 87001: $300 million for sponsor vetting of unaccompanied alien children, with specific uses like background checks, home studies, etc., until Sept 30, 2028.

Now, I need to make sure each summary is concise, max four sentences, specific. Let me check each one.

For Sec. 80001: The amendment to Section 480(f)(2) adds exemptions for family farms, small businesses with ≤100 FTE employees, and commercial fishing businesses to Pell Grant asset calculations, effective July 1, 2026, for award year 2026-2027.

Wait, the section says "exemption of certain assets" under the Higher Education Act. So the assets exempted are those family farms, small businesses, etc. So the summary should state that.

Sec. 80001: Amends the Higher Education Act to exempt family farms, small businesses (≤100 FTE employees), and commercial fishing businesses from asset calculations for Pell Grants, effective July 1, 2026, for award year 2026-2027.

That's one sentence. But the user said at most four sentences. So maybe one or two sentences. Let me check the example they provided. Wait, the user didn't give an example, but the instructions say "at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences. Minimum 1 sentence."

So for each section, one paragraph, up to four sentences. Let's make sure each is specific.

Sec. 81001: Terminates interest-subsidized loans for graduate/professional students after July 1, 2012, with a transition until June 30, 2026. Establishes new annual limits: $20,500 for non-professional graduate students, $50,000 for professional students, and $20,000 annual/ $65,000 aggregate for parent PLUS loans, effective July 1, 2026. Includes a lifetime limit of $257,500 for all loans excluding PLUS loans.

Wait, the section says "the maximum aggregate amount of loans made, insured, or guaranteed under this title that a student may borrow (other than a Federal Direct PLUS loan, or loan under section 428B, made to the student as a parent borrower on behalf of a dependent student) shall be $257,500."

So the lifetime limit is $257,500 for all loans except PLUS loans and parent loans. So the summary should mention that.

Sec. 81001: Terminates interest-subsidized loans for graduate/professional students after July 1, 2012, with a transition until June 30, 2026. Sets new annual unsubsidized Stafford loan limits at $20,500 for non-professional graduate students and $50,000 for professional students, effective July 1, 2026. Parent PLUS loans are capped at $20,000 annually and $65,000 aggregate per dependent student. A $257,500 lifetime limit applies to all loans excluding Federal Direct PLUS and parent borrower loans.

That's four sentences. Let me check if all quantities are included: $20,500, $50,000, $20k annual, $65k aggregate, $257,500. Yes.

Sec. 82001: Requires transition to income-based repayment plans by July 1, 2028, eliminating income-contingent repayment. Introduces the Repayment Assistance Plan, with monthly payments based on 1-10% of AGI, capping at $100k AGI, and 360 payments for forgiveness. Effective July 1, 2026, for loans made on or after that date, replacing previous plans.

Wait, the section says "beginning on July 1, 2026, the income-based Repayment Assistance Plan under subsection (q)." So the new plan starts July 1, 2026. The transition for existing borrowers is by July 1, 2028. So the summary should mention both dates.

Sec. 82001: Eliminates income-contingent repayment plans effective July 1, 2028, and replaces them with the Repayment Assistance Plan starting July 1, 2026. The plan calculates monthly payments as 1-10% of adjusted gross income (AGI), with a $10 minimum, and forgives balances after 360 qualifying payments. Borrowers with loans made on or after July 1, 2026, must choose between the standard repayment plan or the Repayment Assistance Plan. The plan includes interest subsidies and principal matching for low-income borrowers.

Wait, the user said "be specific as to parties, entities, and quantities." So the Repayment Assistance Plan is under the Higher Education Act, the Secretary of Education administers it. The key quantities are the 1-10% AGI, $10 minimum, 360 payments. Also, the standard repayment plan has terms based on total principal.

Wait, the section says "the applicable monthly payment... is equal to the applicable base payment... divided by 12; minus $50 for each dependent." The base payment is 1% for $10k-20k, etc. So maybe mention the AGI brackets. But the user wants concise, so maybe just the key points: 1-10% of AGI, $10 minimum, 360 payments.

But the user said "keep all significant details." So the 1-10% is significant. Let me check the section. The base payment is 1% for $10k-20k, up to 10% for over $100k. So the summary should mention the percentage range.

So Sec. 82001: Replaces income-contingent repayment with the Repayment Assistance Plan, effective July 1, 2026, calculating monthly payments as 1-10% of adjusted gross income (AGI) with a $10 minimum. Borrowers must select between the standard repayment plan (10-25 year terms based on loan balance) or the Repayment Assistance Plan, with forgiveness after 360 qualifying payments. The plan includes interest subsidies and principal matching for payments below $50 monthly. Income-contingent repayment plans are eliminated effective July 1, 2028.

That's four sentences. Let's check the key points: effective dates, payment calculation, plan options, forgiveness, and elimination of old plans.

Sec. 82002: Sunset of economic hardship and unemployment deferments for loans made on or after July 1, 2027. Limits forbearance to 9 months in any 24-month period for such loans. Effective July 1, 2027.

So summary: Ends economic hardship and unemployment deferments for loans originated on or after July 1, 2027, effective immediately for new loans. Limits forbearance to 9 months within any 24-month period for loans made after that date. Applies to all borrowers with loans under the Higher Education Act.

Wait, the section says "a borrower who receives a loan made under this part on or after July 1, 2027, shall not be eligible to defer such loan under subparagraph (B) or (D) of paragraph (2)." So the deferments are sunset for loans made on or after July 1, 2027. Forbearance is limited to 9 months in 24 months for loans made after July 1, 2027.

So Sec. 82002: Eliminates economic hardship and unemployment deferments for loans made on or after July 1, 2027, effective immediately. Limits forbearance to 9 months per 24-month period for such loans. Applies to all borrowers under the Higher Education Act. The changes take effect on July 1, 2027.

Three sentences. Good.

Sec. 82003: Updates loan rehabilitation limits to two times (from one) for FFEL and direct loans, and Perkins loans. Sets a $10 minimum monthly payment for loans made after July 1, 2027.

Summary: Increases loan rehabilitation attempts from one to two times for FFEL and direct loans, and from once to twice for Perkins loans, effective July 1, 2027. Requires a $10 minimum monthly payment for borrowers with loans made on or after July 1, 2027. Applies to all loans under title IV of the Higher Education Act.

Two sentences. Good.

Sec. 82004: Adds on-time payments under the Repayment Assistance Plan as eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF). The amendment adds clause (v) to the existing section.

Summary: Expands Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) eligibility to include on-time payments under the new Repayment Assistance Plan, effective immediately for borrowers. This change modifies Section 455(m)(1)(A) of the Higher Education Act to include such payments as qualifying for PSLF.

Two sentences. Specific: Repayment Assistance Plan payments count towards PSLF.

Sec. 82005: Adds $1 billion for student loan servicing costs, available until expended.

Effective July 1, 2026, with programs aligned to high-skill, high-wage industries and stackable credentials.

Two sentences. Key points: program requirements, effective date, state approval, rates, tuition limits.

Sec. 83003: Increases Pell shortfall from $2.17 billion to $12.67 billion.

Summary: Raises the Pell Grant shortfall from $2.17 billion to $12.67 billion, effective immediately for fiscal year 2026.

One sentence.

Now, I need to check each summary to ensure they're within the limits: max four sentences, specific entities and quantities. Let me verify each one.

Sec. 80001: One sentence. Correct.

Sec. 81001: Four sentences. Let's count: "Terminates interest-subsidized loans... transition until June 30, 2026. Sets new annual unsubsidized Stafford loan limits... effective July 1, 2026. Parent PLUS loans are capped... per dependent student. A $257,500 lifetime limit applies..." Yes, four sentences.

Sec. 82001: Four sentences. Let's check: "Replaces income-contingent repayment... effective July 1, 2026. The plan calculates monthly payments... 360 qualifying payments. Borrowers must select... Repayment Assistance Plan. The plan includes interest subsidies..." Yes, four.

Sec. 82002: Three sentences. "Eliminates economic hardship... effective July 1, 2027. Limits forbearance to 9 months... for such loans. Applies to all borrowers..." Good.

Sec. 82003: Two sentences. Correct.

Sec. 82004: Two sentences. Correct.

Sec. 82005: One sentence. Correct.

Sec. 83001: Two sentences. Correct.

Sec. 83002: Two sentences. Correct.

Sec. 83003: One sentence. Correct.

Sec. 83004: One sentence. Correct.

Sec. 84001: Two sentences. Correct.

Sec. 85001: One sentence. Correct.

Sec. 85002: One sentence. Correct.

Sec. 86001: One sentence. Correct.

Sec. 87001: One sentence. Correct.

All meet the requirements. Now, check for specific entities and quantities. For example, in Sec. 81001, the $20,500, $50,000, $20k annual, $65k aggregate, $257,500. All included. In Sec. 82001, 1-10% AGI, $10 minimum, 360 payments. Correct.

Wait, in Sec. 82001, the section says "the applicable monthly payment... is equal to the applicable base payment... divided by 12; minus $50 for each dependent." So the $50 per dependent is a detail. But the user said "be concise but not vague," so maybe include that. Wait, but the summary I wrote says "with a $10 minimum," which is from the section: "In the case of a borrower with an applicable monthly payment amount calculated under clause (i) that is less than $10, the applicable monthly payment of the borrower shall be $10." So the $10 minimum is important. The $50 per dependent is part of the calculation, but maybe the summary can mention the $10 minimum as the key point. The user wants significant details, so the $10 minimum is significant.

Also, in Sec. 83002, the tuition limit is "the total amount of the published tuition and fees of the program for such year is an amount that does not exceed the value-added earnings of students..." So the tuition must not exceed the value-added earnings, which is calculated as median earnings minus 150% of poverty line. But the summary mentions "tuition not exceeding value-added earnings," which is correct.

In Sec. 84001, the median earnings comparison is to working adults aged 25-34 with relevant education (high school diploma for undergrad, baccalaureate for grad). The summary mentions "working adults (25-34, relevant education)," which is accurate.

I think all the key details are covered. Now, make sure there are no vague terms. For example, "value-added earnings" is a specific term from the bill, so it's okay to use. "Stackable and portable credentials" is also a specific term.

Double-checking the effective dates. For Sec. 80001, effective July 1, 2026, for award year 2026-2027. Correct.

Sec. 81001: effective July 1, 2026. Correct.

Sec. 82001: Repayment Assistance Plan effective July 1, 2026; elimination of income-contingent plans effective July 1, 2028. Correct.

Sec. 82002: effective July 1, 2027. Correct.

Sec. 82003: effective July 1, 2027. Correct.

Sec. 83001: effective July 1, 2026. Correct.

Sec. 83002: effective July 1, 2026. Correct.

Sec. 83003: effective immediately. Correct.

Sec. 83004: effective July 1, 2026. Correct.

Sec. 84001: effective July 1, 2026. Correct.

Sec. 85001: effective date of enactment, with loans originating before July 1, 2035. Correct.

Sec. 85002: same as 85001.

Sec. 86001: fiscal year 2025, available through 2028.

Sec. 87001: fiscal year 2025, available until Sept 30, 2028.

All effective dates are correctly noted.

I think that's all. Now, format each section as per the user's instruction, starting with Sec. 80001.
</think>

Sec. 80001. Amends the Higher Education Act to exempt family farms (where the family resides), small businesses with ≤100 full-time equivalent employees (owned by the family), and commercial fishing businesses (including vessels and permits) from asset calculations for Pell Grants, effective July 1, 2026, for award year 2026–2027.

This change aligns with the 2026–2027 academic year eligibility determinations under the Act.  

Sec. 81001. Terminates interest-subsidized loans for graduate/professional students after July 1, 2012, with a transition until June 30, 2026.

Requires a $10 minimum monthly payment for borrowers with loans made on or after July 1, 2027, under Section 428F(a)(1)(B). Applies to all loans under title IV of the Higher Education Act.  

Sec. 82004. Expands Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) eligibility to include on-time payments under the Repayment Assistance Plan, effective immediately.
