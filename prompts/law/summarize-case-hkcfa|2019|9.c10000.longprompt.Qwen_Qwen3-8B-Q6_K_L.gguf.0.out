### 1. **Summary of the Facts**

This case involves four individuals—three teachers and a former classmate—who were charged under Section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200) for obtaining access to a computer with the intent to gain dishonestly for themselves or another. The incident occurred in 2014 when the teachers were preparing for competitive admission interviews at a government-subsidized primary school. During a briefing, they were given a folder containing interview questions and a marking scheme. The first and second respondents used their smartphones to take photos of the contents and sent them via WhatsApp to others. The third respondent used a school computer to type up the questions and sent them via email to the second respondent and a friend. The fourth respondent, who had previously been a classmate of the second respondent, used her phone to take photos of the questions and sent them to friends via WhatsApp.

All four were acquitted by a magistrate on the grounds that the prosecution failed to prove the necessary elements of dishonesty and that there was no clear evidence that the questions were confidential or that the respondents had any intent to gain dishonestly. The Secretary for Justice appealed the decision, arguing that the use of computers—whether their own or others’—to obtain information for dishonest gain should constitute an offence under Section 161(1)(c). The appeal was heard by the Court of First Instance, which dismissed the appeal, and the case was eventually brought before the Court of Final Appeal.

### 2. **Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties**

**Appellant (Secretary for Justice):**  
The Secretary for Justice argued that the use of a computer—whether owned by the individual or not—to obtain information with the intent to gain dishonestly should be considered an offence under Section 161(1)(c). The appellant contended that the language of the statute is broad and should be interpreted in a way that covers all forms of unauthorized or dishonest access to computers, regardless of whether the computer belongs to the person using it. The appellant emphasized that the purpose of the provision was to criminalize preparatory acts that could lead to fraud or other computer-related crimes. They also argued that the statute should be interpreted in a way that aligns with modern technological developments, such as the use of smartphones and the internet for fraudulent purposes. The appellant provided examples of cases where the statute could be applied, such as using a private email account to forward company emails or taking clandestine photographs.

**Respondents (Cheng Ka Yee and Others):**  
The respondents argued that the use of their own computers to obtain information for dishonest gain does not fall within the scope of Section 161(1)(c). They contended that the statute is specifically directed at unauthorized access to computers belonging to others, and that the language of the statute—particularly the terms “obtain access” and “dishonest gain”—implies that the access must be to a computer that is not the user’s own. The respondents also emphasized that the prosecution failed to prove the necessary elements of dishonesty and that the magistrate’s decision was based on reasonable doubt. They argued that the statute should not be interpreted in a way that creates a broad and potentially overreaching criminal liability for the use of one’s own devices.

### 3. **Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) of the Case**

The Court of Final Appeal held that **Section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance does not apply to the use of a person’s own computer for the purpose of obtaining information with the intent to gain dishonestly**, unless that use involves accessing another computer. This conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the statutory language, context, and legislative purpose.

**Statutory Language and Interpretation:**  
The Court emphasized that the phrase “obtain access to a computer” in Section 161(1)(c) is not a neutral or broad term that encompasses all uses of a computer. Instead, the language suggests a focus on unauthorized or dishonest access to a computer that is not the user’s own. The term “obtain” implies gaining access to something that was previously not accessible, which is more consistent with the idea of accessing another person’s computer. The Court also noted that the word “access” is typically used in the context of gaining entry to a system or data that one is not authorized to use. The Court rejected the argument that the statute should be interpreted in a way that includes the use of one’s own computer, as this would stretch the ordinary meaning of the terms used in the statute.

**Legislative Context and Purpose:**  
The Court examined the legislative history of Section 161, including the Computer Crimes Ordinance of 1993, which was introduced to address the growing problem of computer-related crime. The purpose of the provision was to criminalize preparatory acts that could lead to fraud or other offenses, particularly those involving unauthorized access to computers belonging to others. The Court noted that the legislative intent was to target conduct that involved the misuse of another person’s computer, not the use of one’s own. The Court also pointed out that the provision was part of a broader framework of laws that addressed unauthorized access and misuse of computers, and that the language of Section 161 was specifically tailored to that purpose.

**Distinguishing Between Unauthorized and Authorized Access:**  
The Court distinguished between unauthorized access to a computer and the use of one’s own computer. It held that the term “unauthorized” is not explicitly included in Section 161(1)(c), but the context and purpose of the provision suggest that it is intended to apply only to unauthorized access
