Okay, let's tackle this case. First, I need to summarize the facts. The case is about Hong Kong residents born in Mainland China to at least one Hong Kong permanent resident parent. The applicants are challenging the government's requirement that they obtain a "one-way permit" from the Mainland authorities to establish their right of abode in Hong Kong, as they believe they are entitled under the Basic Law.

Next, the arguments of the parties. The applicants argue that the Basic Law's Article 24 grants them the right of abode without needing Mainland approval. The government counters that Article 22(4) of the Basic Law requires approval from the Central People's Government for entry, hence the permit system is valid.

For the legal principles, the court had to interpret the Basic Law's provisions. The key points are the interplay between Article 24 (right of abode) and Article 22(4) (entry control). The court held that Article 22(4) doesn't override the right of abode for permanent residents, so the permit requirement was unconstitutional. They also addressed the retrospective application of the law, finding it invalid as it retroactively criminalized their presence. The birth out of wedlock issue was resolved by applying equality principles from the ICCPR.

What's striking here is the court's assertion of its own authority to interpret the Basic Law without needing to defer to the Standing Committee unless specific conditions are met. Also, the case is a landmark in Hong Kong's constitutional law, establishing the rights of a significant group of residents and setting precedents on legislative authority and human rights.

### 1. Summary of the Facts  
The case **Ng Ka Ling and Another v. The Director of Immigration [1999]** concerned the constitutional rights of individuals born in mainland China to at least one Hong Kong permanent resident parent. These applicants, including minors and adults, claimed they were entitled to the **right of abode in Hong Kong** under Article 24(2)(3) of the **Basic Law**, Hong Kong’s mini-constitution. However, the Hong Kong government required them to obtain a **“one-way permit”** from mainland Chinese authorities to enter and establish residency, effectively subjecting them to quotas and administrative control. The applicants argued this violated their constitutional rights, while the government defended the scheme as necessary under Article 22(4) of the Basic Law, which regulates entry from mainland China.  

### 2. Arguments of the Parties  
**Applicants (Residents):**  
- Argued that Article 24(3) of the Basic Law unambiguously grants permanent residents (including those born in mainland China to Hong Kong parents) an **absolute right of abode**, which cannot be restricted by external controls like the one-way permit system.  
- Contended that the **Immigration (Amendment) (No. 3) Ordinance 1997** (No. 3 Ordinance), which imposed the permit requirement, was unconstitutional because it infringed on the right of abode guaranteed by the Basic Law.  
- Highlighted that the scheme’s retrospective application (deeming it effective from July 1, 1997, despite enactment on July 10) violated principles of legality and non-retroactivity.  
- In the case of **Miss Cheung Lai Wah**, born out of wedlock, the applicants argued that the exclusion of such children under Schedule 1(2)(b) of the Immigration Ordinance violated equality principles under the **International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)**.  

**Director of Immigration (Government):**  
- Asserted that Article 22(4) of the Basic Law, which requires approval for entry from mainland China and limits settlement numbers, **qualified the right of abode** for those born in mainland China. This justified the one-way permit system as a necessary administrative measure.  
- Argued that the No. 3 Ordinance was valid because it merely **verified** the applicants’ status as permanent residents, with the permit requirement being a procedural safeguard rather than a restriction on rights.  
- Defended the retrospective provision as a legitimate exercise of legislative power to clarify and implement the Basic Law’s provisions.  
- In Miss Cheung’s case, the government claimed that the exclusion of children born out of wedlock (unless legitimized) was consistent with the Basic Law’s definition of parent-child relationships.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The Court of Final Appeal’s judgment, delivered by Chief Justice Li, established several key legal principles:  

#### **A. Interpretation of the Basic Law and Jurisdiction of Hong Kong Courts**  
- **Autonomy and Judicial Authority**: The Court affirmed Hong Kong’s **independent judicial power**, including the authority to interpret the Basic Law **without prior referral** to China’s Standing Committee unless the case involves provisions **directly tied to central government responsibilities** (Article 158). The Court rejected the government’s argument that it must defer to the Standing Committee on the interpretation of Article 22(4).  
- **Contextual Interpretation**: The Basic Law must be interpreted **purposively**, considering its role in implementing “one country, two systems” and protecting fundamental rights. Provisions guaranteeing rights (e.g., Article 24) should be given a **generous interpretation**, while those defining residency classes (e.g., Article 22) are subject to stricter scrutiny.  

#### **B. Right of Abode Under Article 24**  
- **Unconditional Right**: The Court held that Article 24(3) grants permanent residents an **absolute right of abode**, which cannot be restricted by external controls like the one-way permit system. The right includes the freedom to **enter and remain** in Hong Kong without prior approval.  
- **Article 22(4) Does Not Override the Right of Abode**: The Court rejected the government’s argument that Article 22(4) (regulating entry from mainland China) limits the right of abode. It clarified that Article 22(4) applies only to **non-permanent residents** seeking entry, not to those already recognized as permanent residents under Article 24. The permit system thus unlawfully imposed a **precondition** on exercising a constitutional right.  

#### **C. Constitutionality of the No. 3 Ordinance**  
- **Unconstitutional Quota System**: The requirement to obtain a one-way permit from mainland authorities was struck down as unconstitutional. It effectively subjected permanent residents to **quota controls** and **Mainland administrative discretion**, undermining Hong Kong’s autonomy and the Basic Law’s guarantees.  
- **Valid Verification Scheme**: The Court upheld the **non-retroactive** parts of the No. 3 Ordinance that allowed the Director to **verify** claims of permanent residency (e.g., issuing certificates of entitlement) but excised provisions requiring permits or retroactive application.  

#### **D. Retrospective Legislation**  
- **Invalid Retroactivity**: The Court ruled that the No. 3 Ordinance’s retrospective provision (deeming it effective from July 1, 1997) was unconstitutional. It unlawfully criminalized the applicants’ lawful presence in Hong Kong before the law’s enactment, violating **Article 15(1) of the ICCPR** (no retroactive criminal liability).  

#### **E. Equality and Birth Out of Wedlock**  
- **Gender Discrimination**: The exclusion of children born out of wedlock (unless legitimized) under Schedule 1(2)(b) was found unconstitutional. The Court emphasized that the Basic Law and ICCPR require **equality** and non-discrimination. A child’s legitimacy should not depend on the marital status of their parents, particularly when the mother’s rights are not similarly restricted.  

#### **F. Legitimacy of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC)**  
- **Valid Interim Body**: The Court confirmed that the PLC, established by the Preparatory Committee under the National People’s Congress’s 1990 Decision, was a **legally constituted body** with authority to enact laws. This rebutted claims that PLC legislation (including the No. 3 Ordinance) was invalid due to a lack of proper legislative authority.

### 4. Striking or Unusual Aspects of the Case  
- **Landmark Status**: This case is a **seminal decision** in Hong Kong’s constitutional law, clarifying the scope of the right of abode and the limits of central government control over Hong Kong’s autonomy. It set precedents for judicial review of executive actions and legislative validity.  
- **Human Rights Focus**: The Court’s emphasis on **generous interpretation** of fundamental rights (e.g., abode, equality) reflects a progressive approach to constitutionalism, aligning with international norms like the ICCPR.  
- **Political Sensitivity**: The case arose at a critical juncture post-handover (1997), testing the relationship between Hong Kong’s legal system and mainland China. The Court’s assertion of its interpretive authority without deference to the Standing Committee (except in narrow cases) was a bold assertion of judicial independence.  
- **Personal Stories**: The applicants included minors and individuals like Miss Cheung, born out of wedlock, whose cases highlighted the **human impact** of legal technicalities. The Court’s recognition of their rights underscored the importance of individual dignity in constitutional law.  
- **Quota System Controversy**: The one-way permit system, which limited entries to 150 per day, revealed tensions between Hong Kong’s autonomy and mainland China’s control over migration—a theme that persists in contemporary debates over rights and sovereignty.  

This case remains a cornerstone of Hong Kong’s legal framework, illustrating the judiciary’s role in safeguarding constitutional principles amid complex political and social dynamics. [end of text]
