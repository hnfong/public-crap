Got it, let's tackle this case summary step by step. First, I need to make sure I understand the facts, parties' arguments, legal principles, and any striking aspects. Let's start with the facts.

**Facts Summary**: The case involves two appellants, Stephen Chan (an employee of TVB) and Tseng Pei Kun (director of IEAP). Chan hosted a popular talk show "Be My Guest" for TVB but wasn't contractually required to perform on camera. He occasionally did outside commercial engagements through IEAP. Olympian City (OC) sponsored TVB's New Year's Eve Countdown show and wanted to add a live "Be My Guest" segment with Chan interviewing Lai Yiu Cheung. OC contracted IEAP to secure Chan's appearance, paying IEAP $160k, which IEAP split into $112k to Chan, $20k to Lai, and $28k profit. Chan didn't seek TVB's approval for the outside work (contractually required) but TVB knew he was involved. The prosecution charged them with conspiracy (Charge 1), Chan with accepting an advantage (Charge 2), and Tseng with offering an advantage (Charge 3) under POBO §9. The trial judge acquitted, CA reversed twice, then CFA allowed appeals, quashing convictions.

**Parties' Arguments**: 
- **Prosecution**: Argued Chan's appearance was "in relation to TVB's affairs/business" because it boosted ratings, involved TVB's program, and OC intended to influence TVB. They contended §9 doesn't require prejudice to the principal, just that the act relates to the principal's affairs.
- **Appellants**: Chan argued his appearance was moonlighting as a celebrity, not in his role as TVB's GM, so not "in relation to TVB's affairs." Tseng argued the offer wasn't for an act aimed at TVB. They also challenged the CA's application of §9, particularly the "in relation to" test and the reasonable excuse defense.

**Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**: The key issues were the interpretation of §9 POBO, especially:
1. **Elements of §9 Offense**: §9 requires proof that the agent's act (or forbearance) is "in relation to the principal's affairs or business," which must be "aimed at" and "intended to influence or affect" the principal's affairs, undermining the agency relationship (trust/loyalty). Mere "relation" (e.g., being part of a TVB program) is insufficient; there must be a nexus where the act is intended to impact the principal's interests (not just beneficial).
2. **Mens Rea**: For agents accepting advantages, the prosecution must prove the agent knew/believed the advantage was for an act aimed at/influencing the principal's affairs. For offerors, they must intend the advantage to induce such an act.
3. **"In Relation To" Test**: Rejected the CA's broad interpretation; instead, adopted Lord Lloyd's Privy Council guidance in *Ch'ng Poh*: the act must be "aimed at" and "intended to influence/affect" the principal's affairs, not just tangentially related. Beneficial acts (e.g., boosting ratings) without undermining trust don't suffice.
4. **Reasonable Excuse**: Even if the act were "in relation to" TVB, Chan had a reasonable excuse (he believed TVB consented, as they knew of his involvement and it was beneficial), but the CFA focused more on the misinterpretation of §9.
5. **Conspiracy and Reverse Onus**: §24 POBO (reverse onus for reasonable excuse) doesn't apply to conspiracy charges (common law/offense under CO §159A), so prosecution must negate reasonable excuse, which it failed.

**Striking/Unusual Aspects**: 
- The CA's initial reasoning was criticized for criminalizing beneficial conduct: they argued Chan's appearance was an offense because TVB might have suffered if he refused, even though it was beneficial. The CFA reversed this, emphasizing §9 targets conduct undermining agency trust, not beneficial acts.
- Disagreement among judges: Ribeiro PJ focused on the need for conduct adverse to principal interests (undermining trust), while Tang PJ argued Chan had a reasonable excuse (implied consent), but both allowed appeals.
- The case clarified that §9 isn't a "strict liability" offense for agents; it requires proof of intent to influence the principal's affairs, not just receipt of a benefit without consent.</seed:think>### 1. Brief Summary of Facts  
The case involves **Stephen Chan Chi Wan** (General Manager (Broadcasting) at TVB) and **Tseng Pei Kun** (director of IEAP, Chan’s agent for external engagements). Chan hosted a popular TVB talk show *“Be My Guest”* (not part of his contractual duties) and occasionally did paid external events via IEAP. Olympian City (OC), a shopping mall, sponsored TVB’s 2009 New Year’s Eve Countdown show and wanted to add a live *“Be My Guest”* segment with Chan interviewing Lai Yiu Cheung. OC contracted IEAP to secure Chan’s appearance, paying IEAP $160,000—IEAP retained $28,000, paying $112,000 to Chan and $20,000 to Lai. Chan did not seek TVB’s written approval for the external work (contractually required) but TVB knew he was involved.  

The prosecution charged them with: (1) conspiracy to commit an agent-acceptance offense under POBO §9(1)(a); (2) Chan accepting an advantage (§9(1)(a)); (3) Tseng offering an advantage (§9(2)(a)). The trial judge acquitted, but the Court of Appeal (CA) twice reversed the acquittal, convicting on the conspiracy charge. The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) allowed the appeals, quashing all convictions.  


### 2. Arguments of the Parties  
#### **Prosecution**  
- **§9 Offense Elements**: Argued Chan’s appearance was “in relation to TVB’s affairs or business” because:  
  - The segment was part of TVB’s Countdown show (broadcast by TVB), boosting ratings and TVB’s relationship with OC.  
  - OC intended to influence TVB’s business by securing Chan’s popularity, and TVB would have been prejudiced if Chan refused (e.g., lower ratings, strained sponsorship).  
- **No Requirement for Prejudice**: Contended §9 does not require the agent’s act to harm the principal—only that it relates to the principal’s affairs (relying on *Fung Hok Cheung*).  

#### **Appellants**  
- **Chan**: His appearance was moonlighting as a “celebrity/artiste,” not in his role as TVB’s GM. The act did not “influence or affect” TVB (it was beneficial, not undermining trust).  
- **Tseng**: The $112,000 payment was for Chan’s performance as OC’s guest, not to induce an act related to TVB’s affairs.  
- **Misinterpretation of §9**: Challenged the CA’s broad reading of “in relation to,” arguing it required proof the act was “aimed at” TVB (per *Ch’ng Poh*)—not mere tangential involvement.  
- **Reasonable Excuse**: Chan had implied consent (TVB knew of his involvement and it benefited TVB), so the “without reasonable excuse” element of §9 was unproven.  


### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The CFA clarified critical aspects of POBO §9, focusing on its purpose (suppressing corruption undermining agency trust) and correct interpretation:  

#### **a. Core Elements of §9 Offenses**  
§9 criminalizes corrupt transactions between agents and third parties where the agent’s act/forbearance is “in relation to the principal’s affairs or business.” This requires:  
- **Actus Reus**: The agent’s act must be “aimed at” and “intended to influence or affect” the principal’s affairs (per *Ch’ng Poh*). Mere tangential involvement (e.g., being part of a TVB program) is insufficient.  
- **Mens Rea**: For agents accepting advantages, the prosecution must prove the agent **knew/believed** the advantage was for an act intended to influence the principal’s affairs. For offerors, they must **intend** the advantage to induce such an act.  

#### **b. “In Relation To” Test: Narrowed from CA’s Broad Interpretation**  
The CA erred by holding Chan’s appearance was “in relation to TVB” because it boosted ratings. The CFA rejected this, emphasizing *Ch’ng Poh*: the phrase is restrictive, requiring the act to target the principal’s affairs (not just be beneficial). Conduct must undermine the **agency relationship** (trust/loyalty), not merely coincide with the principal’s interests.  

#### **c. No Offense for Beneficial, Trust-Enhancing Conduct**  
§9 does not criminalize acts that benefit the principal (e.g., boosting TVB’s ratings) if they do not undermine the agency relationship. The prosecution failed to prove Chan’s act was intended to harm or undermine TVB—instead, it was mutually beneficial.  

#### **d. Reasonable Excuse Defense**  
Even if the act were “in relation to TVB,” Chan had a reasonable excuse: he honestly believed TVB consented (TVB knew of his involvement and it served their interests). The CA ignored this, but the CFA held the prosecution never proved the act was “in relation to TVB” in the first place.  

#### **e. Conspiracy and Reverse Onus**  
§24 POBO (placing the burden on the accused to prove “reasonable excuse”) does not apply to conspiracy charges (which are common law offenses under Crimes Ordinance §159A). The prosecution must negate reasonable excuse, which it failed to do.  


### 4. Striking/Unusual Aspects  
- **Criminalizing Beneficial Conduct**: The CA’s initial reasoning was extraordinary—it argued Chan committed an offense because TVB *might have suffered* if he refused, even though his appearance was clearly beneficial. The CFA rejected this, emphasizing §9 targets corruption, not pro-principal conduct.  
- **Judicial Disagreement**: While all judges allowed the appeal, Ribeiro PJ focused on the need for conduct undermining agency trust, while Tang PJ argued Chan had a reasonable excuse (implied consent). This split highlights the complexity of §9’s application.  
- **Clarification of “Corrupt” Without the Word**: The CFA rejected the prosecution’s claim that removing “corruptly” from §9 (compared to earlier legislation) meant strict liability. Instead, §9 still requires proof of intent to influence the principal’s affairs, not just receipt of a benefit without consent.  
- **Public vs. Private Sector Distinction**: The case reinforced that §9 (private sector agents) is narrower than §4 (public servants)—it requires a direct nexus to the principal’s affairs, not just acts in the agent’s capacity. [end of text]
