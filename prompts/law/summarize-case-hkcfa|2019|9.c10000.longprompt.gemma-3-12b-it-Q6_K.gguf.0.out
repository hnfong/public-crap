Okay, here's a breakdown of the *Secretary for Justice v. Cheng Ka Yee and Others* case, addressing each of your requested tasks.

**1. Summary of the Facts**

Four individuals – three primary school teachers and a teacher from another school – were charged under Section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200) in Hong Kong. This section criminalizes obtaining access to a computer with the intent of dishonest gain. The teachers had obtained interview questions for competitive primary school admissions by photographing them at a briefing using their mobile phones and a school computer, and then sharing those photos and typed-up versions with others. The Magistrate acquitted them, citing doubts about whether confidentiality had been emphasized at the briefing and concerns about proving dishonesty. The Secretary for Justice appealed this acquittal, seeking to overturn the lower court's decision. The core dispute revolved around whether a person can be charged under this section when using their *own* computer (smartphones) to access and transmit the information.

**2. Summary of the Arguments**

*   **Secretary for Justice (Appellant):** Argued that the law should be interpreted broadly to cover any unauthorized access to a computer with dishonest intent, regardless of whether the computer belongs to the offender. They contended that the use of smartphones to photograph and transmit the interview questions constituted "access" to a computer, and that the actions were sufficiently serious to warrant prosecution. They presented examples of other computer-related crimes that would be difficult to prosecute under a narrow interpretation of the law.
*   **Respondents (Appellees):** Argued that Section 161(1)(c) should be interpreted as requiring access to *someone else's* computer. They contended that using their own devices to photograph and transmit the information did not constitute "access" to a computer in the legal sense. They emphasized the legislative history of the law, which suggested an intent to target preparatory acts for computer-related crimes, particularly those involving unauthorized access to another's system.

**3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The Court of Final Appeal’s decision in *Secretary for Justice v. Cheng Ka Yee and Others* establishes a significant and nuanced interpretation of Section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance. The core ratio decidendi, and the most novel aspect of the case, is that **the offence under Section 161(1)(c) does not apply when a person uses their own computer (e.g., their own smartphone) to access and transmit information, unless that use also involves accessing another person's computer.**

Here's a detailed breakdown of the legal principles established, with consideration of the controversial aspects:

*   **Construction of Section 161(1)(c):** The Court emphasized the importance of statutory construction, beginning with the text of the provision, its context within the Crimes Ordinance, and its legislative history. They rejected a broad interpretation that would criminalize any use of a computer with dishonest intent, regardless of ownership.
*   **The Meaning of "Obtain Access":** The Court scrutinized the meaning of "obtain access to a computer." They found that the ordinary meaning of the words "obtain" and "access" suggests unauthorized use of *another's* computer. The Court noted the redundancy in the language of the section, suggesting that the inclusion of both words was not intended to broaden the scope of the offence to include the use of one's own device. The deletion of a proposed interpretive provision in the legislative history, which would have defined "access" more broadly, further supported this interpretation.
*   **Legislative Intent and Purpose:** The Court carefully examined the legislative history of Section 161(1)(c), including the Memorandum for Legislative Council, the Second Reading speech, and the deliberations of the Legislative Council Subcommittee. They concluded that the purpose of the section was to criminalize preparatory acts for computer-related crimes, particularly those involving unauthorized access to another's computer system. The focus was on preventing actions taken *in preparation* for a substantive offence, such as fraud, where the access itself would not constitute an offence.
*   **Policy Considerations and the Need for a Narrow Interpretation:** While acknowledging the appellant's arguments about the evolving nature of computer crime and the need for a broad interpretation to address new forms of offending, the Court ultimately prioritized the principle of statutory construction. They recognized that a broad interpretation could lead to absurd consequences and potentially criminalize actions that were not intended to be covered by the law. The Court was wary of extending the scope of the offence beyond its intended purpose, particularly in the absence of clear legislative guidance.
*   **Distinction from Other Computer Crime Offences:** The Court highlighted the distinction between Section 161(1)(c) and other computer crime offences, such as those created under the Telecommunications Ordinance (Cap 106) and the Theft Ordinance (Cap 210). These other offences often explicitly require unauthorized access to a computer, emphasizing the importance of the "unauthorized" element. The absence of the word "unauthorized" in Section 161(1)(c) was interpreted as a deliberate choice, reflecting a narrower focus on preparatory acts.
*   **The Appellant's Concession:** The Court noted the appellant's concession that the third respondent's actions (using a school computer) were essentially equivalent to using their own computer for the purposes of this appeal. This
