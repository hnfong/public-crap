## 1. Summary of Facts

The case of *Secretary for Justice v. Cheng Ka Yee and 3 Others* concerns four individuals – three primary school teachers and a teacher from another school – charged under section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200) in Hong Kong. This section criminalizes obtaining access to a computer with the intent of dishonest gain. The teachers were accused of sharing confidential interview questions for school admissions with third parties. Specifically, they photographed the questions from a briefing folder using their mobile phones (smartphones and an iPhone) and transmitted them via WhatsApp. One teacher typed the questions into a Word document on a school computer and emailed it to others. All four were acquitted by the Magistrate, who raised doubts about whether confidentiality had been emphasized at the briefing and whether the element of dishonesty had been proven. The Secretary for Justice appealed this acquittal, seeking a review and ultimately a statement of case on a point of law. The core question before the Court of Final Appeal was whether a person can commit the offence under s 161(1)(c) when the only computer being used belongs to that person.

## 2. Summary of Arguments

**Appellant (Secretary for Justice):** The Secretary for Justice argued that the charges against the teachers were valid and that their actions constituted the offence under s 161(1)(c). The argument centered on a broad interpretation of "obtaining access to a computer." The Secretary contended that using a smartphone (which is a computer) to photograph and transmit confidential information constituted unauthorized access, regardless of whether the phone belonged to the individual committing the act. They argued that a restrictive interpretation would create loopholes, allowing individuals to commit computer-related crimes with impunity, particularly in the context of evolving technology and online offenses like hacking, phishing, and identity theft. The Secretary emphasized the need for a robust interpretation of the law to effectively combat computer-related crime.

**Respondents (Cheng Ka Yee and 3 Others):** The respondents argued that s 161(1)(c) does not apply when a person uses their own computer (e.g., their smartphone) to access and transmit information. They contended that the section was intended to address situations where someone gains unauthorized access to *another's* computer system. They pointed to the legislative history, which indicated the purpose of the law was to address preparatory acts leading to computer-related crimes, particularly those involving unauthorized access to someone else's system. They argued that the language of the statute, particularly the use of "obtain access," implies access to a computer belonging to someone else. They also highlighted the potential for absurd consequences if a broader interpretation were adopted, where simply using one's own device to transmit information could constitute an offence.



## 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The Court of Final Appeal’s decision in *Secretary for Justice v. Cheng Ka Yee and 3 Others* establishes a significant limitation on the scope of section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance. The core legal principle, or *ratio decidendi*, is that **the offence under s 161(1)(c) does not apply when a person uses their own computer to commit the actus reus, unless that use also involves accessing another person’s computer.** This principle is rooted in a careful consideration of the statutory text, its context, and its legislative history.

**Textual Analysis and the Meaning of "Obtain Access":** The Court meticulously examined the wording of s 161(1)(c), particularly the phrase "obtain access to a computer." The Court emphasized that the ordinary meaning of "obtain" suggests acquiring access to something one *did not* previously have access to. Using one's own device, the Court reasoned, does not fit this definition. The Court also noted the redundancy in the phrasing "obtain access," suggesting that the legislature intended a more specific meaning than simply "use." The Court considered the deleted interpretive provision in s 161(2)(a) which would have defined “obtain access” as “causing a computer to perform any function.” The Court reasoned that the deletion of this provision suggests that the legislature did not intend to encompass such a broad definition.

**Contextual Analysis and the Purpose of the Legislation:** The Court placed considerable weight on the legislative history of the Computer Crimes Ordinance 1993, which introduced s 161(1)(c). The Court highlighted the Working Group’s recommendation for an offence of “dishonest accessing” under the Theft Ordinance, which explicitly referred to accessing a computer "without due authority." The Court also emphasized the Second Reading Speech, where the Secretary for Security stated that the new offence would apply "irrespective of whether the access was authorized or not," but also clarified that it was aimed at penalizing access to a computer for acts preparatory to a fraud. The Court concluded that the purpose of s 161(1)(c) was to criminalize preparatory acts involving unauthorized access to *another’s* computer system, not simply the use of one’s own device.

**Policy Considerations and Avoiding Absurdity:** While acknowledging the evolving nature of technology and the need to combat computer-related crime, the Court rejected the Secretary for Justice’s argument for a broad interpretation that could lead to absurd consequences. The Court recognized the potential for a wide interpretation to criminalize commonplace actions, such as using a personal email account to forward a company email or taking clandestine images with a smartphone. The Court emphasized that other provisions of the Crimes Ordinance and other legislation already address many of the types of computer-related offenses the Secretary for Justice cited as examples.
