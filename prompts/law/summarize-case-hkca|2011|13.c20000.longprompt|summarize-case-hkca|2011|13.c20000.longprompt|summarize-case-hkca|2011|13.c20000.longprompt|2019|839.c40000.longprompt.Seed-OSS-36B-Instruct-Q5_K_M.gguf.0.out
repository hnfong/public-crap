Got it, let's tackle this case summary step by step. First, I need to remember the four tasks: facts, parties' arguments, legal principles (ratio), and striking aspects. 

Starting with the facts. The case is HKSAR v Wong Cho Shing and Others, 2019 HKCA 839. The appellants are police officers convicted of assaulting Tsang Kin Chiu during the 2014 Occupy Central protests. Let me parse the key facts: Tsang was splashing liquid on police from a planter, was arrested, then allegedly assaulted by the appellants (joint enterprise) at the Lung Wo Road Substation—thrown to the ground, kicked, stamped on. D5 also faced a common assault charge for slapping Tsang in interview room 7. The prosecution relied heavily on open-source video/photographs (TVB, Apple Daily, ATV, Now TV) and Tsang's testimony. The defense challenged admissibility/authenticity of the video evidence, identification of the officers, and the judge's credibility assessment of Tsang.

Next, parties' arguments. The appellants (defense) had multiple grounds: (1) Judge wrongly applied "if believed" test for admissibility of video/photos instead of balance of probabilities; (2) Insufficient evidence of video authenticity (no cameraphotographers, unproduced originals); (3) Unsafe identification of D4 and D7 (no witness IDs, judge's own identifications flawed); (4) For D5: Inconsistent credibility (rejected arrest assault claim but accepted interview assault); (5) Sentences were manifestly excessive, especially for senior officers (D1, D2) who allegedly just "failed to intervene." The respondent (prosecution) argued: (1) Correct admissibility test (prima facie authenticity, not balance of probabilities); (2) Video/authenticity proved via circumstantial evidence (Tsang's consistency, TVB's chain of custody, cross-verification with multiple sources); (3) Identifications were safe (witness IDs, clothing/distinctive features, continuity of presence); (4) Sentences were appropriate given police officers' duty to uphold law, need for deterrence.

Legal principles (ratio decidendi). This is the big one. Need to focus on novel/controversial points. First, admissibility of open-source video evidence: The court clarified that the correct test for admissibility is whether the prosecution establishes a prima facie case of authenticity (not balance of probabilities) to get the evidence before the jury. The judge was right to admit the video/photos if they were relevant and prima facie authentic, with ultimate authenticity left to the jury. Second, authentication of electronic evidence: Circumstantial evidence (e.g., Tsang's confirmation of events, TVB's chain of custody for footage, cross-verification with multiple cameras/sources) is sufficient to prove authenticity beyond reasonable doubt. Third, identification of defendants: Judges/juries can make their own identifications from video/photos if the evidence is cogent, but this requires a proper foundation (e.g., witness IDs of the defendant in earlier stages, continuity of clothing/features through the footage). Fourth, joint enterprise: All participants in the assault (including senior officers who "kept watch") were liable, but the court later distinguished D4/D7 as lacking sufficient identification. Fifth, sentencing for police officers: Offences by police against civilians require harsher sentences to maintain public trust, but senior officers' culpability may be higher (though the court later reduced some sentences for mitigating factors like clean records). Also, the court rejected the "best evidence rule" for electronic evidence—copies are admissible if originals are unavailable, as long as authenticity is proven.

Striking/ unusual aspects. Let's see: (1) The case involved high-profile police officers accused of assault during a major political protest, which attracted public attention and highlighted tensions between police and protesters. (2) Heavy reliance on open-source video evidence (from news outlets, social media) which was a novel issue given the ease of editing such materials—court had to grapple with authenticity in the digital age. (3) The judge's detailed analysis of video footage (e.g., clothing patterns, footwear, continuity of presence) to identify defendants, which was unprecedented in scale for a Hong Kong criminal case. (4) The court's criticism of the earlier Production Order ruling (Barnes J) which refused to compel news outlets to produce original footage, but the court held this didn't affect the trial's fairness because the prosecution still proved authenticity via other means. (5) The partial acquittal of D4 and D7 due to insufficient identification evidence, despite convictions of others—showing the high standard for identifying defendants from video evidence. (6) The court's remarks about the Occupy Central context: Acknowledged police stress but emphasized that "no excuse" for assaulting a detained person, balancing sympathy with deterrence.

Wait, need to make sure for ratio decidendi, I'm focusing on the binding legal principles, not just facts. For example, the clarification on the admissibility test for electronic evidence (prima facie vs balance of probabilities) is key. Also, the use of circumstantial evidence for authentication—important because digital evidence is often contested for tampering. Another point: The court's holding that a judge can independently identify a defendant from video/photos if there's a sufficient foundation (witness IDs in earlier stages, consistent clothing/features), but not based solely on the judge's own observation without any witness corroboration (which is why D4/D7 were acquitted).

Also, for the sentencing part, the court distinguished between senior officers (D1/D2) and junior officers (D3/D5/D6) in terms of culpability—seniors had a duty to intervene, so their starting point was higher (24 months vs 21 months), but reduced by 6 months for clean records. That's a novel point on hierarchical liability in joint enterprise among police.

Striking things: The length of the trial (31 days) and the judgment (hundreds of pages) given the number of appellants and evidence. The court's critique of the leave application process—suggesting that hearing leave for multiple appellants separately before a Single Judge was inefficient, as each judge couldn't get the full overview. Also, Tsang's own conviction for assaulting police earlier—shows the complexity of the protest context where both sides had interactions.

Need to structure each section clearly, making sure facts are concise, parties' arguments are balanced, legal principles are detailed with focus on novel points, and striking aspects are distinct from the rest.</seed:think>### 1. Brief Summary of Facts  
In **HKSAR v Wong Cho Shing and Others** (2019), seven serving Hong Kong police officers (appellants) were convicted of assaulting Tsang Kin Chiu during the 2014 Occupy Central protests. The key events unfolded as follows:  
- On October 15, 2014, Tsang splashed liquid from a bottle onto police officers from a planter in Lung Wo Road. He was arrested, restrained, and sprayed with pepper spray.  
- After arrest, Tsang was handed over to a team led by appellants D1 (Detective Chief Inspector) and D2 (Detective Senior Inspector). The prosecution alleged the appellants engaged in a **joint enterprise** to assault Tsang: he was frogmarched to the Lung Wo Road Substation, thrown to the ground, and kicked/stamped on by D3–D7 (junior officers) while D1 and D2 “kept watch.”  
- D5 was additionally convicted of common assault for slapping Tsang twice in interview room 7 of Central Police Station when Tsang refused to unlock his phone.  

The prosecution relied on **open-source video/photographic evidence** (from TVB, Apple Daily, ATV, Now TV) and Tsang’s testimony. The defense challenged the admissibility/authenticity of this evidence, the safety of officer identifications, and the judge’s credibility assessment of Tsang. All appellants were sentenced to 2 years’ imprisonment (D5 received 1 month concurrent for the interview assault).


### 2. Arguments of the Parties  
#### **Appellants (Defense)**  
The appellants advanced multiple grounds to challenge their convictions and sentences:  
- **Admissibility of Video/Photographic Evidence**: The judge erred by applying an “if believed” test for admissibility instead of requiring proof of authenticity on the **balance of probabilities**. They argued the prosecution failed to establish a chain of custody for videos (e.g., unproduced original Blu-ray discs, no cameraphotographer testimony) and that editing/tampering was unproven.  
- **Unsafe Identification**: For D4 and D7, there was no witness identification from video/photos—their convictions rested solely on the judge’s own observations of partial footage, which was insufficient. For other appellants, identification relied on clothing/footwear (e.g., D5’s shoes) that could not uniquely link them to the assault.  
- **Inconsistent Credibility Assessment**: The judge rejected Tsang’s claim of assault during arrest but accepted his testimony of the interview assault, which the defense argued was contradictory.  
- **Manifestly Excessive Sentences**: Sentences were too harsh, especially for senior officers (D1, D2), who allegedly only “failed to intervene” rather than actively assaulting Tsang. The delay in trial (2 years from arrest to conviction) and public backlash also warranted leniency.  

#### **Respondent (Prosecution)**  
The prosecution defended the convictions and sentences:  
- **Admissibility/Authhenticity**: The correct test for admissibility is **prima facie authenticity** (not balance of probabilities)—the judge properly admitted evidence if it was relevant and had a “defined provenance” (e.g., TVB’s chain of custody for footage, Tsang’s confirmation of events). Circumstantial evidence (cross-verification across multiple video sources, rapid broadcast of footage) proved authenticity beyond reasonable doubt.  
- **Safe Identifications**: Witnesses (e.g., senior officers who knew the appellants) identified key defendants in pre-assault footage, and the judge’s analysis of consistent clothing/features (e.g., D3’s distinctive striped shirt, D2’s blue T-shirt) established continuity of presence at the substation.  
- **Credibility of Tsang**: Judges may accept part of a witness’s testimony and reject other parts—Tsang’s account of the substation assault was consistent with video evidence, unlike his vague arrest assault claim.  
- **Appropriate Sentencing**: Police officers who assault detainees undermine public trust and the rule of law, requiring deterrent sentences. All appellants were equally culpable in the joint enterprise, and senior officers (D1, D2) had a duty to stop the assault, justifying harsher starting points.  


### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The case clarified critical legal principles for admissibility, authentication, identification, and sentencing of police officers, with a focus on digital evidence and joint enterprise:  

#### **a. Admissibility of Digital/Open-Source Evidence**  
- **Test for Admissibility**: The court rejected the defense’s demand for a “balance of probabilities” standard for authenticity. Instead, it adopted the **prima facie authenticity** test from *HKSAR v Lee Chi Fai* (2003): evidence is admissible if the prosecution shows a “defined provenance and history” (e.g., how the video was captured, stored, and transmitted) to ensure it is relevant. Ultimate authenticity is reserved for the jury.  
- **Circumstantial Authentication**: Digital evidence (videos/photos) can be authenticated circumstantially. For example:  
  - Tsang’s testimony confirmed he was the person in the footage and events matched his account.  
  - TVB’s chain of custody (automatic server transmission, unedited Blu-ray discs burned within hours) proved the footage was not tampered with.  
  - Cross-verification across multiple sources (TVB, Apple Daily, ATV) confirmed the consistency of events, rebutting claims of fabrication.  

#### **b. Identification of Defendants from Video Evidence**  
- **Judge’s Role in Identification**: A judge may independently identify a defendant from video/photos if there is a **sufficient foundation** (e.g., witness identification of the defendant in earlier stages of the incident, consistent clothing/accessories, or continuity of presence). However, identifications cannot rest solely on the judge’s unaided observation without witness corroboration.  
- **Distinction Between Appellants**: Convictions of D1–D3, D5–D6 were upheld because witnesses (e.g., senior officers) identified them in pre-assault footage, and their clothing/features were traceable through the assault. D4 and D7 were acquitted because there was no witness identification linking them to the substation assault—their convictions relied entirely on the judge’s uncorroborated observations.  

#### **c. Joint Enterprise and Police Culpability**  
- **Senior Officer Liability**: Senior officers (D1, D2) were held liable as part of the joint enterprise not just for failing to intervene, but for “keeping watch” while subordinates assaulted Tsang. The court emphasized that police have a **duty to prevent fellow officers from breaking the law**, making their inaction equivalent to active participation.  
- **Junior Officer Liability**: Junior officers (D3–D6) were convicted for directly assaulting Tsang, with liability grounded in their role in the joint enterprise.  

#### **d. Sentencing for Police Officers**  
- **Deterrent Sentencing**: Offences by police against civilians require harsher sentences to preserve public trust. The court cited *HKSAR v Hui Man Tai* (2008), which held that police who breach the law must be “made examples of.” However, mitigating factors (e.g., clean records, years of service) justified reducing the judge’s starting point (30 months) by 6 months, resulting in 18–24 months’ imprisonment.  
- **Concurrent vs. Consecutive Sentences**: D5’s 1-month interview assault sentence was ordered **consecutive** to his 15-month main sentence, as the court deemed it a separate, deliberate act against a detained person.  

#### **e. Rejection of the “Best Evidence Rule” for Digital Evidence**  
The court reaffirmed that the traditional “best evidence rule” (requiring originals over copies) does not apply to digital evidence. Copies are admissible if authenticity is proven via circumstantial evidence (e.g., chain of custody), as held in *Kajala v Noble* (1982).  


### 4. Striking/Unusual Aspects  
- **High-Stakes Political Context**: The case arose from the 2014 Occupy Central protests, a major political event in Hong Kong, which amplified public interest and scrutiny of police conduct. The court acknowledged the “immense stress” police faced but emphasized that “no excuse” justified assaulting a detained person.  
- **Novel Digital Evidence Challenges**: The heavy reliance on open-source video (from news outlets/social media) was unprecedented in Hong Kong criminal cases. The court had to address modern issues like editing, authentication, and the credibility of user-generated content—setting a precedent for future digital evidence cases.  
- **Judicial Critique of Pre-Trial Proceedings**: The court sharply criticized the earlier *Production Order* ruling by Barnes J, which refused to compel news outlets to produce original footage. The court noted this ruling was “untenable” but held it did not affect fairness because the prosecution still proved authenticity via other means.  
- **Partial Acquittals Due to Identification Failures**: The acquittal of D4 and D7 highlighted the high bar for identifying defendants from video evidence—even for police officers—without witness corroboration.  
- **Length and Complexity**: The 31-day trial and 189-page leave judgments (before the full court) underscored the case’s complexity. The court lamented that separate leave applications for each appellant before a Single Judge were inefficient, as they lacked oversight of the entire case.  
- **Tsang’s Dual Role**: Tsang was both a victim and a convicted offender (he later pleaded guilty to assaulting police during his arrest), adding layers of complexity to the narrative of “protestor vs. police.” [end of text]
