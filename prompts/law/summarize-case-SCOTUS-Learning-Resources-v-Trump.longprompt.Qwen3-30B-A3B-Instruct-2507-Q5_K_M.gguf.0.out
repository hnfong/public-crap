### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case, *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*, centers on the constitutionality of President Donald J. Trump’s use of the **International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)** to impose tariffs on imports from various countries. Shortly after taking office in 2025, President Trump declared two national emergencies under the National Emergencies Act: one related to the influx of illegal drugs from Canada, Mexico, and China, and another concerning persistent U.S. trade deficits that he claimed were harming American manufacturing and supply chains.

In response, he invoked IEEPA to impose two sets of tariffs:
- **Drug trafficking tariffs**: 25% on most Canadian and Mexican imports, and 10% on most Chinese imports.
- **Reciprocal (trade deficit) tariffs**: A minimum 10% duty on all imports from all trading partners, with rates on Chinese goods escalating to as high as 125% over a short period.

These tariffs were imposed unilaterally, without congressional approval, and were subject to frequent modifications—increases, reductions, and exemptions—by executive order. The tariffs were applied regardless of existing trade agreements.

Two groups of plaintiffs sued:
- **Learning Resources, Inc.** and two other small businesses filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, arguing IEEPA did not authorize the tariffs.
- **V.O.S. Selections, Inc.** and five other small businesses, along with 12 states, sued in the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT), making the same argument.

Both lower courts ruled in favor of the plaintiffs. The District Court granted a preliminary injunction, and the CIT granted summary judgment. The Federal Circuit, sitting en banc, affirmed in part, holding that IEEPA did not authorize the tariffs because they were “unbounded in scope, amount, and duration.” The Supreme Court granted certiorari before judgment in both cases and consolidated them.

The central legal question before the Court was whether **IEEPA authorizes the President to impose tariffs**—a power traditionally reserved to Congress under Article I of the Constitution.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties

#### **Government (President Trump) and Pro-Tariff Advocates (Supporting the Majority):**
- **Statutory Interpretation**: The Government argues that IEEPA’s grant of authority to “regulate . . . importation” includes the power to impose tariffs. The word “regulate” is broad and encompasses controlling imports through monetary means, such as tariffs.
- **Historical Precedent**: The Government points to **President Nixon’s 1971 tariffs** (10% on all imports), which were upheld by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals under the predecessor statute, the **Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA)**. It argues that Congress, by re-enacting the same “regulate . . . importation” language in IEEPA in 1977, intended to preserve this authority.
- **Precedent from *Algonquin SNG***: The Government cites *Federal Energy Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc.* (1976), where the Court upheld President Ford’s imposition of monetary exactions on oil imports under a statute that did not mention “tariffs” or “duties.” The Court held that “adjust the imports” included tariffs, and the Government argues that “regulate . . . importation” is even broader.
- **Foreign Affairs Exception**: The Government contends that the major questions doctrine does not apply in foreign affairs contexts, where Congress has historically granted the President broad discretion to act in emergencies.
- **Practical Necessity**: The tariffs were used as a tool to address national emergencies and to negotiate trade deals worth trillions of dollars. The Government argues that the President must have the flexibility to respond swiftly to threats.

#### **Plaintiffs and the Majority (Opposing the Tariffs):**
- **Constitutional Text**: The Constitution vests the power to impose tariffs in Congress alone (Article I, Section 8). The Government concedes this, so any delegation must be clear and explicit.
- **Statutory Text**: The majority argues that “regulate . . . importation” does **not** include the power to impose tariffs. The word “regulate” means to control or govern through rules, not to raise revenue. Tariffs are a **tax**, not a regulation.
- **No Mention of Tariffs**: IEEPA contains **no reference** to “tariff,” “duty,” “tax,” or “revenue.” In contrast, other tariff statutes (e.g., in Title 19) use specific language like “duty” and “surcharge.”
- **Contextual Clues**: The list of powers in IEEPA includes “block,” “prohibit,” “nullify,” “void,” and “compel”—all of which are coercive or prohibitive. Tariffs, by contrast, are **revenue-raising** and operate differently. The majority argues that including tariffs would make the statute partly unconstitutional, as taxing exports is forbidden by the Constitution (Article I, Section 9, Clause 5).
- **Major Questions Doctrine**: The Court applies the **major questions doctrine**, which requires “clear congressional authorization” for executive actions of “major economic and political significance.” The President’s claim to unlimited tariff power is unprecedented and would transform the balance of power between Congress and the Executive.
- **Lack of Historical Precedent**: No President has ever claimed or exercised tariff authority under IEEPA. The Nixon tariffs were based on TWEA, not IEEPA, and were not upheld by the Supreme Court.
- **Legislative History**: The House and Senate Reports on IEEPA describe the statute as authorizing the President to “control or freeze property transactions,” not to impose taxes.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) of the Majority Decision

The **majority opinion**, authored by Chief Justice Roberts and joined by Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, Barrett, and Jackson, holds that **IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs**. The decision rests on a combination of constitutional, statutory, and doctrinal principles, with the **major questions doctrine** serving as the central legal framework.

#### **A. Constitutional Foundation: The Power to Tax is Congress’s Alone**
The Court begins with a foundational constitutional principle: **Article I, Section 8** of the Constitution grants Congress the exclusive power to “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises.” The Framers understood this power as “very clearly . . . a branch of the taxing power” (*Gibbons v. Ogden*, 1824). The Court emphasizes that the power to tax is “the one great power upon which the whole national fabric is based” (*Nicol v. Ames*, 1899), and that Congress alone has “access to the pockets of the people” (*The Federalist No. 48*).

The Government concedes that the President has **no inherent peacetime authority** to impose tariffs. Therefore, any such power must come from **clear congressional delegation**. The Court rejects the idea that the President can unilaterally assume this power through a broad statutory phrase like “regulate . . . importation.”

#### **B. The Major Questions Doctrine: A Constitutional Safeguard**
The Court applies the **major questions doctrine**, a principle developed in recent years to prevent the Executive from claiming vast, transformative powers based on ambiguous statutory language. The doctrine is not a new invention but a **reaffirmation of longstanding separation of powers principles**.

The doctrine applies when:
- The executive action is of **major economic and political significance** (e.g., $4 trillion in projected deficit reduction, $15 trillion in trade deals).
- The power claimed is **unheralded or unprecedented**—no President has ever used IEEPA to impose tariffs.
- The statutory language is **ambiguous** and could be read to authorize the power, but the Court must be skeptical.

The Court stresses that **Congress would not have delegated such a consequential power through vague language**. As Justice Barrett notes, a “reasonable interpreter” would not expect Congress to “pawn[]” such a “big-time policy call[] . . . off to another branch.”

#### **C. Statutory Interpretation: “Regulate” Does Not Mean “Tax”**
The Court conducts a detailed textual analysis of IEEPA’s key provision:  
> “The President may . . . regulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit . . . importation or exportation.”

The Court argues that **“regulate”** means to “fix, establish, or control; to adjust by rule, method, or established mode; to direct by rule or restriction.” It does **not** include the power to **tax**.

Key points:
- **No statute in the U.S. Code** grants the Executive the power to “regulate” and simultaneously gives it the power to tax. The SEC cannot tax securities, even though it regulates them.
- **Congress consistently distinguishes** between “regulate” and “tax.” When it wants to delegate both powers, it does so **separately and expressly**.
- **Tariffs are revenue-raising**, not regulatory. They are “very clearly . . . a branch of the taxing power” (*Gibbons*, 1824).
- **The neighboring verbs** in IEEPA (block, prohibit, nullify, void) are all coercive or prohibitive. Tariffs are **not** in this category—they are **financial**.

#### **D. The “Neighboring Words” Rule and Structural Inconsistency**
The Court applies the **“neighboring words” rule** (*United States v. Williams*, 2008): the meaning of a word is shaped by the words around it. The list of powers in IEEPA is **coherent and consistent**—all are tools to **control or restrict** foreign transactions. Tariffs **break this pattern** because they are **revenue-generating**, not control-oriented.

Moreover, **taxing exports is unconstitutional** (Article I, Section 9, Clause 5). If “regulate” included the power to tax exports, IEEPA would be **partly unconstitutional**—a fatal flaw.

#### **E. Rejection of Historical and Precedential Arguments**
The Court dismisses several arguments from the Government:
- **Nixon’s 1971 tariffs**: The Court notes that Nixon relied on **TWEA**, not IEEPA, and that the **Court of Customs and Patent Appeals** (a specialized, non-Supreme Court body) upheld the tariffs. That single, non-binding decision does **not** establish a “well-settled” meaning.
- **Algonquin SNG**: The Court distinguishes *Algonquin* because Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act **explicitly referenced “duties”** in a prior section, making it natural to infer that “adjust the imports” included tariffs. IEEPA contains **no such reference**.
- **Wartime precedents**: The Court rejects the idea that wartime authority to impose tariffs justifies peacetime power. The President has **no inherent peacetime authority** to tax.

#### **F. The “Lack of Historical Precedent” is a Telling Indicator**
The Court emphasizes that **no President has ever used IEEPA to impose tariffs**—not even once—despite 49 years of its existence and over 70 emergency declarations. This “lack of historical precedent” is a “telling indication” that the power is beyond the President’s “legitimate reach” (*National Federation of Independent Business v. OSHA*, 2022).

#### **G. The “Foreign Affairs Exception” Does Not Apply**
The Government argued that the major questions doctrine should not apply in foreign affairs. The Court **rejects this**. The Framers gave Congress alone the power to impose tariffs during peacetime, regardless of foreign affairs implications. The fact that tariffs have foreign policy uses does **not** make it more likely that Congress would delegate this power through vague language.

#### **H. Conclusion: No Clear Congressional Authorization**
The Court concludes that the President **cannot** point to “clear congressional authorization” for the power to impose tariffs. The statutory text, context, history, and constitutional structure all point to the same result: **IEEPA does not authorize tariffs**.

### 4. Legal Principles and Arguments of the Dissenting Side

The **dissent**, authored by Justice Kavanaugh and joined by Justices Thomas and Alito, argues that **IEEPA does authorize the President to impose tariffs**. The dissent is based on **textualism, historical practice, and precedent**, and it rejects the major questions doctrine as inapplicable.

#### **A. Textualism: “Regulate . . . Importation” Includes Tariffs**
The dissent argues that **“regulate”** means to “control,” “adjust by rule,” or “subject to governing principles.” Tariffs are a **common and traditional means** of regulating imports. The dictionary definitions support this.

The dissent emphasizes that **tariffs are not inherently “taxes”** in the constitutional sense—they are **regulatory tools** used to control trade. The Court’s distinction between “regulate” and “tax” is artificial and ignores historical usage.

#### **B. Historical Precedent: Tariffs Have Been a Core Tool**
The dissent presents a **robust historical record**:
- **President Polk (1840s)**: Imposed tariffs during the Mexican-American War.
- **President Lincoln (1860s)**: Imposed fees on trade with the Confederacy.
- **President McKinley (1898)**: Imposed duties during the Spanish-American War.
- **President Nixon (1971)**: Imposed a 10% tariff on all imports under TWEA, which was upheld by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals.

The dissent argues that **Congress, when enacting IEEPA in 1977, was aware** of these precedents. The House Report explicitly references Nixon’s 1971 tariffs as an example of the “regulate . . . importation” power in action.

#### **C. Precedent from *Algonquin SNG***
The dissent **strongly relies on *Algonquin SNG*** (1976), where the Court upheld President Ford’s imposition of monetary exactions on oil imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. The statute did **not** mention “tariff” or “duty,” yet the Court held that “adjust the imports” included tariffs.

The dissent argues that **IEEPA’s “regulate . . . importation” is broader than “adjust the imports”**, so if the latter includes tariffs, the former must too.

#### **D. The Major Questions Doctrine Does Not Apply in Foreign Affairs**
This is the **core of the dissent’s argument**. The dissent contends that the **major questions doctrine does not apply in foreign affairs** because:
- Congress has **long granted the President broad discretion** in foreign policy.
- The Court has **never applied the doctrine in foreign affairs** cases.
- The **“unwisdom of requiring Congress to lay down narrowly definite standards”** in foreign affairs is well-established (*Youngstown*, 1952; *Curtiss-Wright*, 1936).

The dissent argues that **tariffs are a traditional tool of foreign policy**, used to negotiate trade deals, punish adversaries, and level the playing field. The Court’s decision undermines the President’s ability to act swiftly in emergencies.

#### **E. The “Clear Congressional Authorization” Standard is Too High**
The dissent argues that the majority’s demand for “clear” authorization is **unrealistic**. Congress often delegates broad powers in foreign affairs. The **“regulate . . . importation”** language was **well-understood** in 1977 to include tariffs.

#### **F. Practical Consequences**
The dissent warns that the decision will:
- **Force the U.S. to refund billions** in tariffs collected.
- **Undermine trade deals** worth trillions of dollars.
- **Hinder future presidential action** in emergencies.

### 5. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case

Several aspects of this case are **striking and unprecedented**:

1. **The Court’s Use of the Major Questions Doctrine in a Foreign Affairs Context**: This is the **first time** the Court has applied the major questions doctrine to **foreign affairs**. The dissent argues this is a **radical departure** from precedent. The fact that the Court did so—especially in a case involving national security and trade—raises profound questions about the future of executive power.

2. **The Split on the Major Questions Doctrine**: The Court is **deeply divided** on the doctrine:
   - **Three Justices (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett)**: Apply it rigorously.
   - **Three Justices (Kagan, Sotomayor, Jackson)**: Reject it, relying on **ordinary statutory interpretation**.
   - **Three Justices (Thomas, Kavanaugh, Alito)**: Reject it entirely and argue for **broad presidential power**.

   This **three-way split** suggests the doctrine is **not settled law** and may be in flux.

3. **The Court’s Rejection of a 50-Year-Old Precedent**: The dissent cites **Nixon’s 1971 tariffs** as a key precedent. The majority dismisses it as a **single, non-Supreme Court decision**. This is **unusual**—the Court rarely overturns or ignores such a high-profile historical event.

4. **The Court’s Focus on Legislative History**: Justice Jackson’s concurrence is **unusual** in its **explicit reliance on legislative history** (House and Senate Reports). This is rare in modern constitutional law, where textualism dominates.

5. **The Practical Impact**: The decision could **require the U.S. to refund billions** in tariffs. The Government acknowledged at oral argument that the **refund process would be a “mess.”** This is **unprecedented**—a Supreme Court decision directly ordering the return of **billions of dollars** in revenue.

6. **The Case Was Decided in 2026**: The case was argued in **November 2025** and decided in **February 2026**—a **record speed** for a major constitutional case. This reflects the **urgency** of the issue.

7. **The President’s Power to Impose Tariffs Was Never in Question**: The Court did **not** rule on whether tariffs are **wise policy**—only whether they are **constitutional**. This is a **rare focus on legal authority over policy**.

In sum, this case is **not just a legal decision**—it is a **constitutional turning point** that redefines the balance of power between Congress and the Executive, especially in foreign affairs. [end of text]
