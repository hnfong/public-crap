## 1. Summary of Facts

This case, *HKSAR v. Wong Cho Shing and Others*, concerns five Hong Kong police officers convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm to a protestor, Tsang Kin Chiu, during the 2014 Occupy Central protests. On October 15, 2014, police were clearing protestors near Lung Wo Road. Tsang was observed splashing liquid from a bottle, leading to a struggle and the use of pepper spray. After being restrained and rinsed with water, Tsang was handed over to the officers in question. The prosecution alleged that the officers jointly assaulted Tsang behind a substation, with senior officers (D1 and D2) acting as lookouts. D5 was also convicted of a separate common assault charge for slapping Tsang inside a police interview room. The trial involved the admissibility of video recordings and photographs taken from various sources (Apple Daily, Oriental Daily, TVB, Now TV, and CCTV) documenting the events. The court also considered a failed application for a Production Order to obtain the original recordings and identify their makers. A key point of contention was the reliability and authenticity of the open-source video evidence.

## 2. Summary of Arguments

**The Prosecution's Arguments:**

*   **Admissibility of Video Evidence:** The prosecution argued that the video recordings and photographs were relevant and, if believed, sufficient to prove the assault beyond a reasonable doubt. They contended that the prosecution needed only establish a *prima facie* case of authenticity, or, alternatively, that the "balance of probabilities" test should apply.
*   **Identification:** The prosecution relied on the video footage, photographs, and witness testimony (particularly Tsang's) to identify the officers involved in the assault. They emphasized the distinctive clothing and features of the officers visible in the recordings.
*   **Joint Enterprise:** The prosecution asserted that the officers acted as part of a joint enterprise to assault Tsang, with senior officers facilitating the attack.
*   **Sentencing:** The prosecution argued for a significant sentence, emphasizing the seriousness of police officers abusing their power and damaging public trust.

**The Appellants' Arguments:**

*   **Admissibility of Video Evidence:** The appellants argued that the prosecution failed to adequately prove the authenticity and provenance of the video recordings and photographs. They contended that the *prima facie* standard was not met, and the "balance of probabilities" test should have been applied. They questioned the lack of testimony from the videographers and the potential for tampering.
*   **Identification:** The appellants challenged the accuracy of the identifications made by the judge, arguing that the video quality was poor and that the identifications were based on flimsy evidence (e.g., clothing). They argued that the judge should not have relied solely on his own observations.
*   **Lack of Evidence:** Regarding D4 and D7, the appellants argued that there was insufficient evidence to link them to the assault, as they were not identified in any of the video footage or photographs.
*   **Sentencing:** The appellants sought reduced sentences, citing their long and distinguished careers in the police force, the stressful circumstances they faced during the protests, and the potential loss of their pensions.



## 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The Court of Appeal’s judgment in *HKSAR v. Wong Cho Shing and Others* establishes and clarifies several important legal principles, particularly concerning the admissibility of open-source video evidence in criminal trials. The case is notable for its detailed analysis of the evidentiary standards and the potential pitfalls of relying on such material.

**1. Admissibility of Video Evidence: The *Prima Facie* Standard & Rejection of "Balance of Probabilities"**

The Court firmly upheld the established principle, rooted in *R v Robson* and reaffirmed in *HKSAR v Lee Chi Fai*, that the test for admissibility of video recordings is whether the prosecution establishes a *prima facie* case of authenticity. This means the prosecution must present sufficient evidence to define and describe the provenance and history of the recordings up to the point of production in court. The Court explicitly rejected the argument that the higher standard of "balance of probabilities" should apply, finding that such a standard would inappropriately shift the burden of proof onto the defense regarding the authenticity of the evidence. The Court emphasized that the ultimate question of authenticity, weight, and credibility remains for the jury (or trial judge) to determine.

**2. Relevance as a Prerequisite:**

The Court reiterated that the initial step in determining admissibility is to assess whether the video evidence, *if authentic*, would be relevant to the case. This is a crucial preliminary assessment, as irrelevant evidence is inadmissible regardless of its authenticity.

**3. Circumstantial Evidence and Authentication:**

The Court confirmed that authenticity can be proven circumstantially. This is particularly relevant in cases involving open-source material where direct testimony from the videographer is unavailable. The Court highlighted the importance of considering factors such as the consistency of the footage with other evidence, the absence of signs of tampering, and the testimony of witnesses who can corroborate the events depicted.

**4. The Role of the Trial Judge:**

The Court emphasized the trial judge’s role as a gatekeeper in assessing the admissibility of video evidence. The judge must carefully scrutinize the evidence, consider the arguments of both parties, and make a reasoned determination as to whether a *prima facie* case of authenticity has been established. The judge’s decision is subject to appellate review.

**5. The Significance of Tsang's Testimony:**

The Court recognized the unique importance of Tsang’s testimony in this case. As a central figure in the events depicted in the video recordings, his ability to identify himself and corroborate the sequence of events significantly strengthened the prosecution’s case regarding authenticity. The Court acknowledged that while Tsang’s testimony regarding the initial arrest was rejected, his subsequent account of the events at the substation was accepted as credible.

**6. Identification Based on Clothing and Features:**

The Court acknowledged that identification based on clothing and distinctive features can be sufficient to establish a person’s presence in a video recording, particularly when combined with other corroborating evidence. However, the Court cautioned that such identifications must be carefully scrutinized and should not be based on flimsy or speculative evidence.

**7. The Failure of the Production Order and its Impact:**

The Court addressed the significance of the failed application for a Production Order. While acknowledging that the absence of the original recordings and the videographer’s testimony was a disadvantage, the Court concluded that it did not render the trial unfair. The Court emphasized that the prosecution was able to present sufficient evidence to establish a *prima facie* case of authenticity, despite the lack of the original material.

**8. D4 and D7 – The Limits of Self-Identification:**

The Court’s decision regarding D4 and D7 is particularly noteworthy. The Court found that the trial judge’s identification of these officers was unsafe because it was based solely on the judge’s own observations, without any corroborating witness testimony. This highlights the importance of independent verification in identification evidence and underscores the limitations of a judge’s ability to make identifications based solely on visual observation. The Court’s decision effectively established a higher threshold for self-identification in the absence of corroborating evidence.

**9. Sentencing Considerations:**

The Court addressed the sentencing considerations, acknowledging the seriousness of the officers’ actions in abusing their power and damaging public trust. However, the Court also recognized the mitigating factors, including the officers’ long service records and the stressful circumstances they faced during the protests. The Court adjusted the sentences downwards, reflecting these considerations.

**Novel and Controversial Points:**

*   **Rejection of "Balance of Probabilities":** The Court’s reaffirmation of the *prima facie* standard for authenticity, despite arguments to the contrary, is a significant point of law. This reinforces the traditional evidentiary framework and prevents the evidentiary bar from being lowered in cases involving open-source material.
*   **Reliance on Self-Identification:** The Court’s decision regarding D4 and D7 highlights the dangers of relying solely on a judge’s own observations for identification purposes. This sets a higher standard for identification evidence and underscores the importance of independent verification.
*   **The Impact of the Failed Production Order:** The Court’s finding that the failed Production Order did not render the trial unfair is a practical and pragmatic approach. It acknowledges the challenges of obtaining open-source material while upholding the principles of fair trial.



This case provides a comprehensive analysis of the evidentiary challenges posed by open-source video evidence and offers valuable guidance to courts and practitioners dealing with similar cases. The Court’s reaffirmation of the *prima facie* standard and its emphasis on the importance of independent verification are particularly noteworthy contributions to the law of evidence.
