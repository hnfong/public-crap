### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case, *W v. The Registrar of Marriages* [2013] HKCFA 39, concerns a post-operative male-to-female transsexual woman, referred to as W, who sought to marry her male partner in Hong Kong. W was born biologically male but has undergone a full course of gender reassignment treatment, including hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery (SRS), which involved the removal of her male genitalia and the construction of a neovagina. She has been issued with a Hospital Authority letter certifying her gender as female, and her identity card and passport reflect this change. Despite this, the Registrar of Marriages refused to allow her to marry her male partner, citing the Marriage Ordinance (Cap 181) and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance (Cap 179), which define marriage as a union between one man and one woman.

W challenged this decision through judicial review, arguing that she should be legally recognized as a woman for the purposes of marriage. The High Court and Court of Appeal both upheld the Registrar’s decision, applying the precedent set by *Corbett v Corbett* (1971), which held that biological sex at birth is determinative for marriage. The case then reached the Court of Final Appeal (CFA), where the majority of the Court (Chief Justice Ma and Mr Justice Ribeiro PJ, with Lord Hoffmann NPJ concurring) allowed the appeal, ruling that the statutory interpretation of "woman" must be updated to reflect modern medical and social realities. Mr Justice Chan PJ dissented, maintaining that the law should remain unchanged.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties

**Appellant (W):**
W’s core argument was that she is legally a woman for the purposes of marriage, despite being born male, because she has undergone irreversible medical and social transition to live as a woman. She contended that the law should not be confined to the outdated *Corbett* test, which relies solely on biological criteria (chromosomes, gonads, and genitalia) fixed at birth. Instead, she argued that the law should consider the full range of factors—psychological, social, and medical—relevant to a person’s gender identity at the time of marriage. She emphasized that she lives as a woman, is recognized as such in all aspects of life (including identity documents), and has undergone extensive, irreversible surgery. She further argued that denying her the right to marry in her acquired gender violates her constitutional rights under Article 37 of the Basic Law (freedom of marriage) and Article 19(2) of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights (right to marry), as it impairs the very essence of the right to marry.

**Respondent (Registrar of Marriages):**
The Registrar argued that the law must follow the *Corbett* precedent, which holds that biological sex at birth is immutable and determinative for marriage. He maintained that the Marriage Ordinance and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance were enacted to reflect this principle, particularly through the adoption of the UK’s *Nullity of Marriage Act 1971*, which explicitly states that a marriage is void if the parties are not respectively male and female.
