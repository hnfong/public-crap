Okay, let me tackle this case step by step. First, I need to summarize the facts. The case is about four teachers and a friend who leaked interview questions from a primary school's admission process. They used their own phones and a school computer to send the questions to others. They were charged under section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance for obtaining access to a computer with dishonest intent. The trial court acquitted them, and the appeal court upheld the acquittal, leading to this final appeal.

Next, the arguments of the two parties. The prosecution (Secretary for Justice) argued that using one's own computer to transmit confidential information still falls under the statute, so the teachers' actions were illegal. The defense probably argued that since they used their own devices or had authorized access to the school computer, there was no unauthorized access required by the law. They might have also questioned the element of dishonesty.

For the legal principles, the key issue is the interpretation of section 161(1)(c). The court had to decide if "obtaining access to a computer" requires unauthorized access. The ratio here is that the offense doesn't apply when the person uses their own computer or a computer they're authorized to use. The court looked at the statute's wording, legislative history, and purpose. The legislative intent was to criminalize preparatory acts involving unauthorized access, not any use of one's own device. The court rejected the prosecution's broader interpretation to avoid absurd outcomes, like criminalizing common uses of personal devices.

Lastly, what's striking? The case clarifies a gap in computer crime laws, showing that using your own device isn't covered under this specific statute. It's notable because it deals with modern tech issues and the limits of legal definitions. Also, the fact that teachers leaked exam questions might be seen as unethical, but the legal technicality here is interesting.

### 1. Summary of the Facts  
The case involves four teachers at the Church of Christ in China Heep Woh Primary School and a friend who leaked confidential interview questions used for the school’s competitive admission process. On June 13, 2014, the teachers were briefed on the interview questions and marking scheme, which were provided in folders. Using their personal smartphones (Xiaomi, Samsung, iPhone) and a school desktop computer, they photographed or transcribed the questions and transmitted them to third parties via WhatsApp and email. The fourth respondent, a teacher at another school, also shared the questions using her phone. All four were charged under **section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap. 200)**, which criminalizes obtaining access to a computer with a view to dishonest gain. The trial magistrate acquitted them, citing doubts about the confidentiality of the questions and insufficient proof of dishonest intent. The Secretary for Justice appealed, focusing on whether the statute applies when the computer used belongs to the accused.

### 2. Summary of the Parties’ Arguments  
**Prosecution (Secretary for Justice):**  
- Argued that the statute’s wording—“obtaining access to a computer”—does not require *unauthorized* access.  
- Claimed that using one’s own device (e.g., smartphones) to transmit confidential information constitutes the actus reus of the offense.  
- Emphasized that the legislative intent of **section 161** was to criminalize preparatory acts involving computers, regardless of ownership or authorization.  
- Cited public policy concerns, asserting that a narrow interpretation would create legal loopholes for modern cybercrimes (e.g., phishing, hacking via personal devices).  

**Defense:**  
- Contended that **section 161(1)(c)** implicitly requires *unauthorized* access to another’s computer, as the statute’s purpose was to address misuse of others’ systems.  
- Argued that using one’s own device (e.g., taking photos with a personal phone) or authorized school computers does not satisfy the actus reus.  
- Highlighted that the trial court’s acquittal was reasonable, as dishonest intent was not proven beyond doubt.  
- Warned against expanding the statute to cover everyday uses of personal technology, which could lead to absurd outcomes (e.g., criminalizing “upskirt photos” or social media misuse under the same provision).

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The Court of Final Appeal held that **section 161(1)(c)** does **not** apply when the accused uses their own computer or a computer they are authorized to use. The key principles are as follows:  

#### **Textual Analysis**  
- The phrase “obtains access to a computer” implies accessing a system *not under one’s control*. The verbs “obtain” and “access” suggest gaining entry to something previously inaccessible.  
- The absence of the word “unauthorized” in **section 161(1)** does not override this implication. The statute’s structure (Part XIII, “Miscellaneous Offences”) and its placement alongside other computer misuse provisions (e.g., hacking under **s. 27A** of the Telecommunications Ordinance) indicate it targets *unauthorized* access.  

#### **Legislative History and Purpose**  
- The 1993 Computer Crimes Ordinance aimed to criminalize preparatory acts (e.g., accessing a computer to plan fraud) that were not covered by existing laws. The legislative intent focused on *unauthorized* access to others’ systems to address gaps in inchoate offenses.  
- The Working Group’s recommendation for a “dishonest accessing”
