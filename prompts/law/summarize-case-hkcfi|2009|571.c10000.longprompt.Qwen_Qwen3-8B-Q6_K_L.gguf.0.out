### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts

This case involves the conviction of Chan Ming Lok for the offense of possession of an offensive weapon under section 33(1) of the Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245). The incident occurred on 29 June 2008 in a public place near Cochrane Street in Central, Hong Kong. A police officer observed the appellant walking in the area, appearing suspicious due to the late hour and his behavior. The officer followed him and eventually intercepted him. During the encounter, the appellant was found carrying a knife in his rucksack. When questioned, he claimed the knife was for self-defense, as he feared being robbed while returning from Shenzhen. The magistrate found the knife to be an offensive weapon and convicted the appellant, sentencing him to six months’ imprisonment.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties

**Appellant’s Argument (Mr. Stephen Wong):**  
The appellant’s legal representative, Mr. Stephen Wong, argued that the magistrate erred in concluding that the knife was an offensive weapon. He contended that the knife did not fall under the category of an article “suitable for causing injury to the person,” as per section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance. Wong referenced the obiter dictum from *R v. Chong Ah Choi & Others* [1994] 2 HKCLR 263, where Justice Bokhary suggested that the definition of “offensive weapon” might need to be interpreted in light of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (Cap. 383), potentially excluding the “suitable for causing injury” category. Wong argued that the magistrate’s findings were unclear and that the knife’s classification as an offensive weapon was based on an incorrect legal interpretation.

**Respondent’s Argument (Miss Vinci Lam):**  
The respondent, represented by Miss Vinci Lam, conceded that the magistrate’s findings were not clearly articulated but argued that the knife clearly fell under the definition of an offensive weapon. She emphasized that the knife was pointed and sharp, capable of causing injury, and that the appellant’s admission of carrying it for self-defense in Shenzhen did not negate its classification as an offensive weapon under the Ordinance. Lam also noted that the magistrate had found the appellant’s statements credible and that the knife’s presence in a public place, regardless of its intended use, constituted an offense. She further argued that the law’s strict stance on offensive weapons was necessary for public safety.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) of the Case

The central legal issue in this case was whether the knife in question constituted an “offensive weapon” under section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance. The Ordinance defines an offensive weapon as any article that is (a) made for causing injury, (b) adapted for such use, (c) suitable for causing injury, or (d) intended by the possessor for such use. The court’s decision hinged on the interpretation of these categories, particularly the third category, which was the subject of legal debate due to its potential conflict with the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance.

The court acknowledged that the definition of “offensive weapon” in the Ordinance was not without controversy. Justice Bokhary’s obiter dictum in *R v. Chong Ah Choi & Others* suggested that the “suitable for causing injury” category might be incompatible with the Bill of Rights, which protects individuals from arbitrary detention and unreasonable searches. However, the court did not adopt this interpretation, noting that the Secretary of Justice had accepted that the “suitable for causing injury” category had been effectively removed, leaving only the first three categories. This left the legal framework ambiguous, as the Ordinance had not been formally amended to reflect this change.

The court emphasized that the magistrate’s findings were not clearly articulated, particularly regarding the basis for concluding that the knife was an offensive weapon. The magistrate had not explicitly stated whether the knife fell under category (c) or (d), which raised concerns about the legal reasoning. However, the court ultimately concluded that the knife was an offensive weapon based on its physical characteristics—being pointed and sharp, capable of causing injury. The court also noted that the appellant’s admission of carrying the knife for self-defense did not negate its classification as an offensive weapon, as the law does not require proof of intent to use the weapon for offensive purposes, only that it is suitable for such use.

A key legal principle established in this case is that the mere possession of an item capable of causing injury in a public place can constitute an offense under the Public Order Ordinance, regardless of the possessor’s stated intent. The court rejected the argument that the appellant’s self-defense claim could exempt him from liability, emphasizing that the law views the presence of offensive weapons in public spaces as a serious threat to public order. The court also highlighted the importance of public safety, noting that the absence of offensive weapons is a key factor in maintaining the safety of Hong Kong’s streets.

Another significant legal principle is the court’s recognition of the potential conflict between the definition of “offensive weapon” in the Ordinance and the protections afforded by the Bill of Rights. While the court did not formally amend the Ordinance, it acknowledged that the legal framework was outdated and in need of reform. This highlights a broader issue in Hong Kong’s legal system: the tension between statutory definitions and constitutional rights, particularly in areas where the law may be perceived as overly broad or punitive.

The court also addressed the issue of reasonable excuse for possession. It clarified that self-defense, even if genuine, does not constitute a reasonable excuse for possessing an offensive weapon unless there is evidence of imminent danger. In this case, the appellant had not demonstrated any such danger, and therefore, his possession of the knife was deemed unlawful. This reinforces the principle that the law does not permit individuals to carry weapons for self-defense in public spaces unless there is a clear and immediate threat.

Finally, the court emphasized the importance of judicial clarity in legal reasoning. The magistrate’s failure to clearly articulate the basis for her findings raised concerns about the reliability of the conviction. However, the court ultimately found that the evidence supported the conviction, and the appeal against conviction was dismissed. This underscores the importance of clear and transparent legal reasoning in criminal cases, particularly when the law is ambiguous or outdated.

### 4. Anything Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable About the Case

One striking aspect of this case is the legal ambiguity surrounding the definition of “offensive weapon” in the Public Order Ordinance. The Ordinance’s definition, which includes the category of items “suitable for causing injury to the person,” has been the subject of legal debate for over a decade. The court acknowledged that this category may conflict with the protections afforded by the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, yet it did not formally amend the law. This highlights a broader issue in Hong Kong’s legal system: the tension between statutory definitions and constitutional rights, particularly in areas where the law may be perceived as overly broad or punitive.

Another remarkable feature of the case is the appellant’s admission that he carried the knife for self-defense in Shenzhen, not in Hong Kong. This raises questions about the jurisdictional reach of the law and whether the intent of the possessor is relevant to the classification of an item as an offensive weapon. The court rejected this argument, emphasizing that the law does not require proof of intent to use the weapon for offensive purposes, only that the item is suitable for such use. This underscores the strict interpretation of the law in public order offenses, where the mere presence of a potentially dangerous item in a public place is sufficient to constitute an offense.

Additionally, the case highlights the importance of judicial clarity in legal reasoning. The magistrate’s failure to clearly articulate the basis for her findings raised concerns about the reliability of the conviction. However, the court ultimately found that the evidence supported the conviction, and the appeal against conviction was dismissed. This underscores the importance of clear and transparent legal reasoning in criminal cases, particularly when the law is ambiguous or outdated.

Finally, the case is notable for its emphasis on public safety. The court stressed that the absence of offensive weapons is a key factor in maintaining the safety of Hong Kong’s streets. This reflects a broader societal concern about the presence of weapons in public spaces and the need for strict enforcement of laws related to public order. The court’s decision reinforces the seriousness with which the law views the carrying of offensive weapons, even in the context of self-defense. [end of text]
