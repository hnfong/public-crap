### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case of LEUNG KWOK HUNG AND OTHERS v. HKSAR [2005] HKCFA 40 concerns the constitutionality of the Public Order Ordinance, Cap. 245, which regulates public processions and meetings in Hong Kong. On February 10, 2002, a public procession was held in Hong Kong to protest against the conviction of an activist for assault and obstruction of a public officer. The procession, which started at Chater Garden and proceeded to Police Headquarters, was not notified to the Commissioner of Police as required by the Ordinance. As a result, the appellants were convicted of holding an unauthorized assembly and assisting in holding such an assembly under s. 17A(3)(b)(i) of the Ordinance. The appellants appealed their convictions, arguing that the statutory scheme for regulating public processions was unconstitutional.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**Appellants' Argument:**
The appellants argued that the statutory scheme for regulating public processions, particularly the Commissioner of Police's discretion to restrict the right of peaceful assembly for the purpose of "public order (ordre public)," was unconstitutional. They contended that the concept of "public order (ordre public)" was too wide and uncertain to satisfy the constitutional requirements for restriction. Additionally, they argued that the scheme's provisions for prior restraint were overly broad and lacked the necessary precision and proportionality required by the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance.

**Respondent's Argument:**
The respondent, the Government, argued that the statutory scheme was constitutional. They contended that the notification requirement was a reasonable measure to enable the police to ensure public safety and maintain order. The Government also argued that the Commissioner's discretion to restrict public assemblies for the purpose of "public order (ordre public)" was sufficiently precise and necessary in a democratic society. They further argued that the scheme provided adequate safeguards, including the right to appeal to an Appeal Board and judicial review, to prevent arbitrary or disproportionate use of the Commissioner's powers.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The Court's judgment in this case established several key legal principles:

**Prescribed by Law Requirement:**
- The Court held that a statutory discretion to restrict fundamental rights must give an adequate indication of the scope of the discretion with a degree of precision appropriate to the subject matter. The concept of "public order (ordre public)" was found to be too imprecise and uncertain to satisfy this requirement.
- The Court emphasized that the Commissioner's discretion to restrict the right of peaceful assembly for the purpose of "public order (ordre public)" did not provide an adequate indication of its scope and thus failed the "prescribed by law" requirement.

**Necessity Requirement:**
- The Court applied a proportionality test to determine whether the restriction on the right of peaceful assembly was necessary in a democratic society. The test required that the restriction be rationally connected to the legitimate purpose and be no more than necessary to accomplish that purpose.
- The Court held that the Commissioner's discretion to restrict the right of peaceful assembly for the purpose of "public order (ordre public)" was not sufficiently circumscribed to be constitutional. The Court found that the concept of "public order (ordre public)" was too wide and lacked the necessary precision and proportionality.

**Proportionality Test:**
- The Court adopted a proportionality test to evaluate the necessity of restrictions on fundamental rights. This test required that the restriction be rationally connected to the legitimate purpose and be no more than necessary to accomplish that purpose.
- The Court held that the Commissioner's discretion to restrict the right of peaceful assembly for the purpose of "public order (ordre public)" was not proportionate because it was too broad and lacked the necessary safeguards to prevent arbitrary or disproportionate use.

**Positive Duty on the Government:**
- The Court recognized that the right of peaceful assembly involves a positive duty on the Government to take reasonable and appropriate measures to enable lawful assemblies to take place peacefully. This positive duty is consistent with the approach taken by the European Court of Human Rights in Plattform 'Ärzte für das Leben' v. Austria.

**Severance of Unconstitutional Provisions:**
- The Court held that the appropriate remedy for the unconstitutionality of the Commissioner's discretion to restrict the right of peaceful assembly for the purpose of "public order (ordre public)" was to sever the unconstitutional part from the statute. The Court held that the Commissioner's discretion to restrict the right of peaceful assembly for the purpose of "public order" (in the law and order sense) was constitutional and could survive the severance.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case

**Unprecedented Constitutional Challenge:**
This case marked the first time that the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal had been asked to rule on the constitutionality of the Public Order Ordinance. The challenge to the Ordinance was significant because it involved fundamental rights and freedoms, and the Court's decision had far-reaching implications for the regulation of public assemblies in Hong Kong.

**Complexity of Legal Issues:**
The case involved complex legal issues, including the interpretation of the "prescribed by law" requirement, the necessity requirement, and the proportionality test. The Court's decision provided detailed guidance on these issues, which are crucial for the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.

**Impact on Public Order Regulations:**
The Court's decision had a significant impact on the regulation of public assemblies in Hong Kong. By striking down certain provisions of the Public Order Ordinance, the Court effectively narrowed the scope of the Commissioner's discretion to restrict public assemblies, which could have implications for future public demonstrations and protests.

**Dissenting Opinion:**
Chief Justice Bokhary's dissenting opinion provided a different perspective on the case, arguing that the Commissioner's powers of prior restraint were unconstitutional. This dissent highlighted the complexity of the legal issues involved and the potential for different interpretations of the constitutional requirements.

**Significance for Democratic Freedoms:**
The case underscored the importance of protecting democratic freedoms, such as the right to peaceful assembly, and the role of the judiciary in safeguarding these rights against potential overreach by the executive branch. The Court's decision emphasized the need for clear and precise statutory provisions to ensure that fundamental rights and freedoms are not unduly restricted. 

In summary, this case is remarkable for its far-reaching implications for the regulation of public assemblies in Hong Kong, the detailed legal analysis provided by the Court, and the potential for different interpretations of constitutional requirements. The case highlights the ongoing tension between the need for public order and the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms in a democratic society. [end of text]
