### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case of LEUNG KWOK HUNG AND OTHERS v. HKSAR [2005] HKCFA 40 concerns the constitutionality of the Public Order Ordinance, Cap. 245, which regulates public processions and meetings in Hong Kong. The appellants, Leung Kwok Hung and others, were convicted for holding an unauthorized assembly during a public procession on February 10, 2002, in protest against the conviction of an activist for assault and obstruction of a public officer. The procession, which started at Chater Garden and proceeded to Police Headquarters, was not notified to the Commissioner of Police as required by the Ordinance. The appellants challenged the constitutionality of the statutory scheme for regulating public processions, arguing that it was too wide and uncertain to satisfy constitutional requirements.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments

**Appellants' Argument:**

The appellants argued that the Commissioner of Police's discretion to restrict the right of peaceful assembly for the purpose of "public order (ordre public)" was too wide and uncertain to satisfy the constitutional requirements. They contended that the concept of "public order (ordre public)" was imprecise and could be used to justify arbitrary restrictions on the right to peaceful assembly. They also argued that the notification requirement was constitutional but that the Commissioner's powers to object to or impose conditions on public processions were unconstitutional due to their vagueness and potential for abuse.

**Respondent's Argument:**

The respondent, the Government, argued that the statutory scheme was constitutional and that the Commissioner's discretion to restrict public processions was sufficiently circumscribed. They contended that the notification requirement was necessary to enable the police to ensure public safety and maintain order. The Government also argued that the Commissioner's powers to object to or impose conditions on public processions were necessary to protect public order and the rights and freedoms of others. They maintained that the scheme provided adequate safeguards, including the requirement for the Commissioner to give reasons for his decisions and the availability of an appeal mechanism.

### 3. Summary of the Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**Prescribed by Law Requirement:**

The Court held that the Commissioner's discretion to restrict the right of peaceful assembly for the purpose of "public order (ordre public)" did not satisfy the constitutional requirement of "prescribed by law." The concept of "public order (ordre public)" was deemed too imprecise and uncertain to provide adequate guidance to individuals on how to regulate their conduct. The Court emphasized the need for legal certainty, particularly in the context of fundamental rights and freedoms.

**Necessity Requirement:**

The Court applied the proportionality test to determine whether the restrictions on the right of peaceful assembly were necessary in a democratic society. It held that the Commissioner's discretion to restrict public processions for the purpose of "public order (ordre public)" was not necessary because it was too broad and could be used to justify arbitrary restrictions. The Court emphasized that the Commissioner's discretion must be constrained by clear and objective standards to ensure that it does not infringe on fundamental rights and freedoms.

**Severance of "Public Order (Ordre Public)":**

The Court held that the appropriate remedy was to sever "public order (ordre public)" from the Commissioner's discretion to restrict public processions. The Court found that "public order" (in the sense of maintaining public order and preventing public disorder) was sufficiently certain and could be constitutionally valid. However, the broader concept of "public order (ordre public)" was unconstitutional due to its imprecision and potential for abuse.

**Entitlement to Notification:**

The Court held that the Commissioner's entitlement to notification of public meetings and processions was constitutional. The notification requirement was deemed necessary to enable proper policing and to ensure the safety of participants and the general public. The Court also held that spontaneous demonstrations were exempt from the notification requirement to ensure that the right to peaceful assembly was not unduly restricted.

**Unconstitutionality of Criminal Sanctions:**

The Court declared that the criminal sanctions in Section 17A of the Public Order Ordinance were unconstitutional, as they were too closely tied to the Commissioner's unconstitutional powers of prior restraint. The Court emphasized that the enforcement of the notification requirement should be achieved through constitutional means, such as the power to prevent, stop, or disperse non-notified public meetings and processions.

**Positive Duty on the Government:**

The Court recognized the positive duty of the Government to take reasonable and appropriate measures to enable lawful assemblies to take place peacefully. This duty was seen as an essential component of the right to peaceful assembly and was emphasized as a constitutional requirement.

**Proportionality and Certainty:**

The Court emphasized the importance of proportionality and legal certainty in the context of fundamental rights and freedoms. It held that any restriction on the right of peaceful assembly must be necessary, proportionate, and clearly defined to ensure that individuals can regulate their conduct without fear of arbitrary interference.

**Conclusion:**

The Court dismissed the appeal, upholding the convictions of the appellants. However, it declared that the Commissioner's powers of prior restraint under the challenged schemes were unconstitutional and struck them down. The Court also declared Section 17A of the Public Order Ordinance unconstitutional due to its close ties to the Commissioner's unconstitutional powers of prior restraint.

The decision highlights the importance of legal certainty and proportionality in the context of fundamental rights and freedoms, particularly in the regulation of public assemblies. It also underscores the need for clear and objective standards to guide the exercise of discretion by public officials in matters affecting fundamental rights. [end of text]
