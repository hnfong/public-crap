### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts

The case involves four respondents: three primary school teachers from the Church of Christ in China Heep Woh Primary School and one teacher from another school. They were charged under section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200) for "obtaining access to a computer with a view to dishonest gain for himself or another." The facts show that on 13 June 2014, they used their own devices (smartphones, a school computer) to photograph confidential interview questions for an admission process and transmitted them to third parties via WhatsApp and email. The respondents were acquitted by the Magistrate, who found reasonable doubt about confidentiality warnings and dishonesty. The Secretary for Justice appealed, arguing the actus reus of the offence includes using one's own computer with dishonest intent, even without unauthorized extraction of information. The Court of First Instance dismissed the appeal, holding that s 161(1)(c) requires unauthorized extraction and use of information from a computer not belonging to the offender. The Secretary for Justice then appealed to the Court of Final Appeal (CFA).

### 2. Arguments of the Two Parties

**Appellant (Secretary for Justice):**
- The actus reus of s 161(1)(c) is not restricted to unauthorized extraction and use of information from another's computer. It includes any access to a computer with dishonest intent, regardless of ownership.
- The phrase "obtain access to a computer" should be given its natural meaning: gaining possession or control over computer resources.
- The legislative purpose was to criminalize preparatory computer misuse, including using one's own computer for dishonest purposes.
- The narrow interpretation would create a legal lacuna, leaving many forms of computer misuse unpunished (e.g., phishing, identity theft, clandestine photography).

**Respondents:**
- The offence requires unauthorized access to a computer, which inherently excludes using one's own computer.
- The statutory language ("obtain access") and legislative history show Parliament intended to target external, unauthorized use.
- The Court should not expand the offence beyond its clear text and purpose, as that would be legislative overreach.
- The case involves misuse of one's own property, which is not the target of the provision.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**Key Legal Principles:**

1. **Statutory Interpretation Framework:**
   - The Court applies a three-step approach: text, context, and purpose (para 34).
   - The ordinary meaning of "obtain access" suggests gaining possession of something not previously owned (para 38).
   - Legislative history (Memorandum, Second Reading Debate) shows Parliament intended to target external unauthorized access, not internal misuse (paras 21-30).

2. **Actus Reus Requirement:**
   - The offence requires "obtaining access to a computer" with dishonest intent (para 19).
   - The Court interprets "access" as involving a computer not belonging to the offender (para 37-44).
   - The phrase "unauthorized extraction and use of information" is central to the actus reus (para 14, 48).

3. **Purpose of the Offence:**
   - Section 161 was designed to criminalize preparatory acts for future offences, not internal misuse (para 42-43).
   - The legislative intent was to address external threats, not self-serving conduct (para 44).

4. **Novel/Controversial Points:**
   - The Court rejects the argument that "access" includes using one's own computer, despite technological advancements (para 45-47).
   - The decision emphasizes textualism over purposivism, refusing to expand the offence for policy reasons (para 47).
   - The case highlights the tension between judicial restraint and legislative intent in cybercrime legislation.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

1. **Technological Paradox:** The case involves modern technology (smartphones, WhatsApp, email) but hinges on a statutory interpretation that refuses to adapt to digital realities. The Court explicitly acknowledges the technological shift but chooses textual narrowness (para 45-47).

2. **Self-Ownership Doctrine:** The Court's refusal to punish self-misuse of one's own computer is striking. It prioritizes property rights over cybercrime prevention, even when the conduct is clearly dishonest (para 48).

3. **Legislative History as Barrier:** The Court heavily relies on legislative history to limit the offence, despite the respondents' conduct being precisely the type of "dishonest accessing" Parliament intended to target (paras 21-30).

4. **Academic Irony:** The case involves teachers who breached confidentiality to gain unfair advantage in school admissions. The Court's narrow interpretation effectively legitimizes such conduct if done on one's own device, which is counterintuitive.

5. **Precedential Impact:** The decision creates a significant loophole in Hong Kong's cybercrime framework, potentially encouraging internal misuse of computers under the guise of "self-ownership" (para 48).

This case is remarkable for its conservative approach to statutory interpretation in the face of rapidly evolving cybercrime, prioritizing textual purity over practical justice. [end of text]
