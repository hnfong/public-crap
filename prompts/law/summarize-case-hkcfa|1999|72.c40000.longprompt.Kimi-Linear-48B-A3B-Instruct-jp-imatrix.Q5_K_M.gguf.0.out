### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts

The case **Ng Ka Ling and Others v. Director of Immigration** ([1999] HKCFA 72) concerns the interpretation and application of **Article 24(2) and (3)** of the **Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)**, particularly regarding the **right of abode** for permanent residents. The appellants are **three Chinese nationals born in mainland China** who claimed permanent resident status in Hong Kong under **Category 3 of Article 24(2)** of the Basic Law, which includes persons of Chinese nationality born outside Hong Kong to parents who are permanent residents of Hong Kong.

The Director of Immigration **refused to recognize their right of abode**, arguing that they must first obtain a **one-way permit** and a **certificate of entitlement** under the **Immigration (Amendment) (No. 3) Ordinance 1997** (No. 3 Ordinance) before they could exercise their constitutional right. The applicants challenged this, arguing that the Basic Law guaranteed them the right of abode unconditionally once they were classified as permanent residents.

The case involved multiple legal issues, including:
- Whether the **No. 3 Ordinance** was constitutional.
- Whether the **retrospective application** of the No. 3 Ordinance was lawful.
- Whether **discrimination against children born out of wedlock** in the definition of parent-child relationships was constitutional.
- Whether the **Provisional Legislative Council (PLC)** was legally constituted.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments

#### **Appellants' Arguments:**
- The **Basic Law** explicitly grants permanent residents the **right of abode** (Article 24(3)), and this right is **unconditional**.
- The **No. 3 Ordinance** was **unconstitutional** because it imposed an **additional requirement** (one-way permit + certificate of entitlement) beyond what the Basic Law stipulated.
- The **retrospective provision** in the No. 3 Ordinance was **unconstitutional** as it violated **Article 15(1) of the ICCPR** (non-retroactivity of criminal laws).
- The **discrimination against children born out of wedlock** in the definition of parent-child relationships was **unconstitutional** under **Article 25 (equality)** and **Article 23(1) (family rights)** of the ICCPR.
- The **Provisional Legislative Council (PLC)** was **legally constituted** under the **1990 Decision** of the National People's Congress.

#### **Director of Immigration's Arguments:**
- **Article 22(4)** of the Basic Law requires **Central Government approval** for entry into Hong Kong for settlement, and this **qualifies** the right of abode under Article 24(3).
- The **No. 3 Ordinance** was necessary to **verify** permanent resident status and prevent **abuse** of the right of abode.
- The **retrospective provision** was valid because it **did not criminalize past conduct** but merely **delayed the exercise** of the right of abode.
- The **discrimination against out-of-wedlock children** was justified under **immigration policies** and **family reunification principles**.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

#### **A. Jurisdiction of Hong Kong Courts to Interpret the Basic Law**
- The **Court of Final Appeal (CFA)** has the **power to interpret the Basic Law** in adjudicating cases (Article 158(2)).
- However, if the interpretation involves **Central Government affairs** or **relations between Central and Regional authorities**, the CFA must **seek an interpretation** from the **Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC)** (Article 158(3)).
- The **CFA has the authority to determine** whether a provision is an **excluded provision** (i.e., concerning Central Government affairs or Central-Regional relations) and whether the **necessity condition** for referral is met.

#### **B. Interpretation of Article 24(2) and (3) – Right of Abode**
- **Article 24(3)** grants **unconditional right of abode** to permanent residents.
- The **third category** (Article 24(2)(3)) includes **children born outside Hong Kong to permanent residents**, and this **includes children born out of wedlock**.
- The **Director’s scheme** (No. 3 Ordinance) was **unconstitutional** because it **imposed an additional requirement** (one-way permit + certificate of entitlement) **beyond the Basic Law’s guarantee**.
- The **Joint Declaration’s reference to continued Mainland exit controls** did **not qualify** the right of abode of permanent residents.

#### **C. Constitutionality of the No. 3 Ordinance**
- The **No. 3 Ordinance** was **severed** of its unconstitutional parts:
  - **Section 2AA(1)(a)** (requiring a certificate of entitlement) was **struck down**.
  - **Section 53D(3)(a)** (preventing appeals against removal orders) was **struck down**.
  - **Form 12** (certificate of entitlement) was **amended** to remove the requirement of attachment to a travel document.
- The **retrospective provision** (Section 1(2)) was **unconstitutional** under **Article 15(1) of the ICCPR**, as it **criminalized past conduct** without fair warning.

#### **D. Discrimination Against Out-of-Wedlock Children**
- **Paragraph 1(2)(b) of Schedule 1** (defining father-child relationships) was **unconstitutional** because it **discriminated against children born out of wedlock**.
- The **Basic Law and ICCPR** guarantee **equality** (Article 25) and **family rights** (Article 23(1)), and **discrimination based on birth status** is **unjustified**.
- The provision was **severed**, and the law now treats **legitimate and illegitimate children equally** for the purpose of permanent residency.

#### **E. Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) Validity**
- The **PLC was legally constituted** under the **1990 Decision** of the NPC, which authorized the Preparatory Committee to establish an interim legislature.
- The **PLC’s enactment of laws** was **valid** because it was done **pursuant to the NPC’s authority** and **consistent with the Basic Law**.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

1. **Unprecedented Judicial Scrutiny of Mainland Exit Controls**  
   - The case **boldly declared** that **Mainland exit controls** (one-way permits) **do not override** the **constitutional right of abode** of Hong Kong permanent residents, marking a **significant assertion of judicial independence** against **Central Government authority**.

2. **Severance of Unconstitutional Provisions**  
   - The court **severed multiple provisions** of the **No. 3 Ordinance**, including **criminal penalties** for overstaying without a certificate of entitlement, **demonstrating a willingness to strike down** even **criminal laws** that violate constitutional rights.

3. **Discrimination Against Out-of-Wedlock Children**  
   - The **rejection of gendered discrimination** in parent-child relationships was **progressive**, aligning Hong Kong’s laws with **international human rights standards** (ICCPR Articles 3, 26).

4. **Retrospective Criminalization Struck Down**  
   - The court **struck down a retrospective provision** that would have **criminalized past conduct**, invoking **Article 15(1) of the ICCPR**—a **rare judicial intervention** against **ex post facto laws**.

5. **Political Context of the PLC**  
   - The case **resolved a major political dispute** over the **legitimacy of the PLC**, confirming that **interim legislatures** could be **constitutionally valid** if established **pursuant to NPC decisions**, even without **universal suffrage**.

6. **Symbolic Victory for Human Rights**  
   - The judgment **reaffirmed Hong Kong’s autonomy** in **constitutional interpretation**, **protecting fundamental rights** against **executive overreach**, and **setting a precedent** for future **Basic Law challenges**.

### **Conclusion**
This case is **landmark** in Hong Kong’s constitutional jurisprudence, **reaffirming judicial independence**, **protecting fundamental rights**, and **limiting executive discretion** in immigration matters. It remains a **critical reference** for future **Basic Law interpretation** and **human rights adjudication** in Hong Kong. [end of text]
