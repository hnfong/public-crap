### 1. Brief Summary of Facts

The case **KWOK CHEUK KIN AND ANOTHER v. DIRECTOR OF LANDS AND OTHERS** ([2021] HKCA 54) concerns a constitutional challenge to the **New Territories Small House Policy** ("Small House Policy"), a long-standing government policy in Hong Kong that grants eligible indigenous villagers (NTIIs) the right to apply for a small house (a traditional village dwelling) on government or private land. The applicants, who are not indigenous villagers, challenged the policy on the grounds that it is discriminatory based on **social origin, birth, and sex**, violating **Basic Law articles 25, 39, and 22** (equality and anti-discrimination provisions). The respondents and an interested party argued that the policy is protected under **Basic Law article 40**, which guarantees the protection of "lawful traditional rights and interests" of NTIIs.

The Court of Appeal (HKCA) ultimately upheld the policy in its entirety, ruling that the Ding Rights (the right to apply for a small house) are **lawful traditional rights** protected under BL40, despite their discriminatory nature. The court rejected the lower court's partial invalidation of the policy and dismissed the applicants' claims on both **constitutional and procedural grounds** (lack of standing and delay).

### 2. Summary of the Parties' Arguments

#### **Applicants' Arguments:**
- The Small House Policy is **discriminatory** under BL25, BL39, and BOR22 (equality provisions) because it only benefits male indigenous villagers.
- The policy is **not protected** by BL40 because:
  - "Traditional" rights must be traceable to pre-1898 customs (which they argue the Ding Rights are not).
  - "Lawful" means lawful under **both pre-1898 Qing law and post-1997 Hong Kong law**, and the policy is unlawful under modern equality standards.
  - The Ding Rights are not "rights or interests" but merely a **discretionary government policy**, not a legally enforceable right.

#### **Respondents' (Government) Arguments:**
- The Small House Policy is a **lawful traditional right** protected by BL40, as it derives from pre-1898 customs and has been continuously recognized in Hong Kong law.
- The policy is **constitutional** because:
  - BL40 protects rights that were **lawful at the time of the Basic Law's enactment (1990)**.
  - The policy is **traceable** to pre-1898 customary land tenure and building rights.
  - The policy is **protected by BL120 and BL122** (which preserve pre-1997 land grants), reinforcing its constitutional status.
- The policy is **not discriminatory** under BL40 due to **CEDAW reservations** (UK and PRC reservations to CEDAW allow continued application of discriminatory customary laws for NTIIs).

#### **Interested Party's Arguments (Heung Yee Kuk):**
- The Small House Policy, including **private treaty grants and land exchanges**, is fully protected under BL40 as **lawful traditional rights**.
- The court erred in limiting BL40 protection to **free building licences only**, ignoring the broader traditional rights to land acquisition.
- The policy is **traditional** because it reproduces the essential features of pre-1898 customary land rights, even if the form has evolved.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) – Detailed Analysis

#### **A. Construction of BL40: "Lawful Traditional Rights and Interests"**
The court adopted a **contextual and purposive approach** to interpreting BL40, emphasizing:
- **Historical Context:** BL40 was drafted in 1990 against the backdrop of the **1997 handover** and the need to preserve NTIIs' customary rights. The drafters intended to protect rights that were **lawful and traditional at the time of enactment**, not to freeze them in pre-1898 form.
- **Coherence Principle:** BL40 must be read **harmoniously with BL120 and BL122**, which explicitly protect pre-1997 land grants (including small houses). This confirms that the Ding Rights are **constitutional rights**, not mere administrative privileges.
- **CEDAW Reservations:** The UK and PRC reservations to CEDAW (allowing continued application of discriminatory customary laws for NTIIs) reinforce that BL40 protects these rights **despite their discriminatory nature** under other laws.

#### **B. "Traditional" Rights: No Tracing Exercise Required**
The court **rejected the tracing exercise** proposed by the lower court judge, holding that:
- BL40 does **not require** a right to be traceable to pre-1898 customs if it was **recognized as traditional and lawful in 1990**.
- The Ding Rights were **continuously recognized** in Hong Kong law since 1898 (via free building licences, private treaty grants, and exchanges), even if their form evolved.
- The policy’s **administrative continuity** (no legal challenge since 1972) confirms its **long-standing recognition** as a traditional right.

#### **C. "Lawful" Rights: Protection Despite Discrimination**
- The court held that **"lawful" in BL40 refers to legality at the time of the Basic Law’s enactment (1990)**, not under modern equality laws.
- The policy was **never struck down** before 1997, and the **CEDAW reservations** confirm that discriminatory customary laws are **acceptable under international law** for NTIIs.
- The policy is **constitutional** because it was **lawful in 1990** and protected by BL40, even if it would now violate BL25/39 under a strict equality analysis.

#### **D. Procedural Defences (Standing & Delay)**
- **Standing:** The applicants lacked standing because they **did not own land** in the New Territories or show any **personal interest** in the policy. They were **ordinary residents**, not NTIIs.
- **Delay:** The **23-year delay** in bringing the challenge was **unreasonable**, causing **prejudice to third parties** (e.g., landowners, government) and undermining **good administration**. The court refused relief on this basis even if the policy were unconstitutional.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

1. **Constitutional Protection for Discriminatory Rights:**  
   The court **upheld a discriminatory policy** (denying women and non-indigenous villagers the right to build small houses) as a **constitutional right** under BL40, citing **CEDAW reservations** and **historical continuity**. This is unusual because constitutional courts typically **strike down** discriminatory laws, not protect them.

2. **No Tracing Exercise Required:**  
   The court **rejected the lower court’s tracing exercise**, holding that BL40 protects rights **recognized as traditional and lawful in 1990**, not those **traceable to 1898**. This is a **novel interpretation**, avoiding a rigid historical analysis.

3. **Coherence with Land Leases:**  
   The court **read BL40 with BL120 and BL122**, confirming that small house grants are **protected land rights**, not mere administrative concessions. This **elevates a policy to constitutional status**, which is rare.

4. **Procedural Bar on Delay:**  
   The court **refused relief based on delay and lack of standing**, even though the policy had been **consistently applied for 47 years**. This is **unusual** because courts usually **balance prejudice vs. public interest**, but here, the **prejudice to third parties** (landowners, government) was deemed **more significant**.

5. **CEDAW Reservations as Constitutional Interpretation Tool:**  
   The court **relied on international reservations** (CEDAW) to **justify domestic constitutional protection** of discriminatory rights. This is **remarkable** because courts typically **set aside** international reservations when interpreting domestic law.

---

### **Conclusion**
The case is a **landmark constitutional decision** that **upholds a discriminatory customary right** as **protected under BL40**, despite its incompatibility with modern equality norms. The court’s ** purposive interpretation**, **coherence principle**, and **CEDAW reservations** create a **unique constitutional framework** where **tradition trumps equality** in the context of NTIIs. The **procedural dismissal** on standing and delay further underscores the court’s **deference to administrative continuity** over individual challenges. [end of text]
