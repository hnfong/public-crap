## 1. Summary of Facts

The case of *Ng Ka Ling and Another v. The Director of Immigration* concerns the interpretation of Article 24 of the Basic Law, which defines who qualifies as a permanent resident of Hong Kong and, consequently, who enjoys the right of abode. Following the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, several Chinese nationals born on the mainland, with at least one parent being a Hong Kong permanent resident, sought to assert their right of abode.

The case specifically involves four applicants: Ng Ka Ling, Ng Tan Tan (sisters), Tsui Kuen Nang, and Cheung Lai Wah. All four entered Hong Kong around July 1, 1997, claiming permanent resident status under Article 24(2)(3) (descendants of Hong Kong permanent residents). The Director of Immigration denied their claims, arresting and detaining them. They subsequently launched judicial review proceedings challenging the Director's actions.  A key element of the case is the Immigration (Amendment) (No. 3) Ordinance 1997 ("No. 3 Ordinance"), which introduced a scheme requiring applicants claiming permanent resident status by descent to obtain a certificate of entitlement affixed to a travel document from the Mainland Chinese authorities as proof of their status.  Cheung Lai Wah's case is further complicated by the fact she was born out of wedlock.

## 2. Summary of Arguments

**Applicants (Ng Ka Ling, Ng Tan Tan, Tsui Kuen Nang, and Cheung Lai Wah):**

*   **Right of Abode:** The applicants argued they met the criteria for permanent residency under Article 24(2)(3) of the Basic Law and, therefore, were entitled to the right of abode in Hong Kong as guaranteed by Article 24(3).
*   **No. 3 Ordinance Unconstitutional:** They contended that the No. 3 Ordinance, particularly the requirement of a certificate of entitlement from Mainland authorities, was unconstitutional. They argued it imposed an unreasonable and unlawful restriction on their right of abode, effectively requiring them to seek approval from the Chinese government to exercise a right guaranteed by Hong Kong's Basic Law.
*   **Retrospective Application:** They challenged the retrospective application of the No. 3 Ordinance, arguing it criminalized actions they took before the ordinance came into effect.
*   **Born Out of Wedlock (Cheung Lai Wah):** Cheung Lai Wah specifically argued that her birth out of wedlock should not disqualify her from permanent residency, as the Basic Law does not discriminate based on marital status.
*   **PLC Legitimacy:** They questioned the legality of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) which enacted the No. 3 Ordinance, arguing it was not the legitimate legislature established under the Basic Law.

**Director of Immigration:**

*   **No. 3 Ordinance Valid:** The Director defended the No. 3 Ordinance, arguing it was a reasonable and necessary measure to verify claims of permanent residency, particularly given the influx of applicants.
*   **Article 22(4) Qualification:** The Director argued that Article 22(4) of the Basic Law, concerning entry requirements for people from other parts of China, qualified the right of abode, allowing for Mainland authorities to regulate entry, including requiring a one-way permit.
*   **PLC Legitimacy:** The Director asserted that the PLC was legally constituted under the 1990 Decision of the National People's Congress and had the authority to enact the No. 3 Ordinance.
*   **Born Out of Wedlock:** The Director argued that the relevant provisions of the Immigration Ordinance, which discriminated against children born out of wedlock, were consistent with the Basic Law.



## 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The Court of Final Appeal's judgment in *Ng Ka Ling and Another v. The Director of Immigration* establishes several significant legal principles concerning the interpretation of the Basic Law, the relationship between Hong Kong and Mainland China, and the constitutional validity of legislation. The case is notable for its exploration of the limits of Hong Kong's autonomy and the role of the courts in interpreting the Basic Law.

**1. Constitutional Jurisdiction of Hong Kong Courts:**

*   **Broad Jurisdiction:** The Court definitively affirmed that the Hong Kong courts possess the jurisdiction to interpret the Basic Law and to review the actions of both the Hong Kong and Mainland governments to ensure consistency with the Basic Law. This includes the power to examine acts of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee.
*   **Rejection of *Ma Wai Kwan David*:** The Court overturned the earlier decision in *HKSAR v Ma Wai Kwan David*, which had limited the courts' power to review Mainland legislation. The Court reasoned that the pre-1997 analogy to the UK Parliament was inapplicable in the new constitutional order.
*   **Article 158 and the Court of Final Appeal:** While Article 158 requires the Court of Final Appeal to seek an interpretation from the Standing Committee if it needs to interpret provisions concerning the Central Government's responsibilities or the relationship between the two entities, the Court clarified that this obligation is triggered only when specific conditions are met (the "classification condition" and the "necessity condition"). The Court has the power to interpret provisions within the Region's autonomy without referral.

**2. Interpretation of the Basic Law:**

*   **Purposive Approach:** The Court emphasized the need for a purposive approach to interpreting the Basic Law, considering its overall purpose of implementing "one country, two systems" and upholding Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy.
*   **Generous Interpretation of Rights:** The Court advocated for a generous interpretation of provisions guaranteeing fundamental rights and freedoms under Chapter III of the Basic Law.
*   **Contextual Interpretation:** The Court stressed the importance of considering the context of each provision, including other provisions within the Basic Law and relevant extrinsic materials like the Joint Declaration.

**3. Constitutionality of the No. 3 Ordinance:**

*   **Unconstitutionality of Certificate Requirement:** The Court held that the requirement under the No. 3 Ordinance for permanent residents to obtain a certificate of entitlement from Mainland authorities before exercising their right of abode was unconstitutional. This requirement effectively placed the exercise of a fundamental right under the control of the Mainland government, infringing on Hong Kong's autonomy.
*   **Unconstitutionality of Retrospective Application:** The Court found the retrospective application of the No. 3 Ordinance, which criminalized actions taken before its enactment, to be unconstitutional, violating Article 15(1) of the ICCPR.
*   **Severance:** The Court ordered the severance of the unconstitutional provisions of the No. 3 Ordinance, leaving the scheme for verifying permanent resident status (excluding the certificate requirement) intact.
*   **Director's Notice:** The Court ordered the excision of specific paragraphs of the Director's Notice related to Mainland involvement in the verification process.

**4. Born Out of Wedlock:**

*   **Discrimination Unconstitutional:** The Court held that the provision in the Immigration Ordinance discriminating against children born out of wedlock was unconstitutional. The Court reasoned that such discrimination was inconsistent with the principles of equality enshrined in the Basic Law and the ICCPR.

**5. Legality of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC):**

*   **PLC Constitutionally Valid:** The Court concluded that the PLC was legally constituted under the 1990 Decision of the National People's Congress and had the authority to enact the No. 3 Ordinance. The Court found that the PLC's establishment was consistent with the Basic Law's provisions regarding the formation of the Legislative Council.

**Novel and Controversial Points:**

*   **Scope of Judicial Review over Mainland Actions:** The Court's unequivocal assertion of the Hong Kong courts' power to review acts of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee was a significant and potentially controversial development. This affirmed the courts' role as a constitutional check on the Mainland government.
*   **Balancing Autonomy and Mainland Authority:** The case highlighted the ongoing tension between Hong Kong's autonomy and the authority of the Mainland government. The Court's decision sought to strike a balance, upholding Hong Kong's fundamental rights while acknowledging the Mainland's role in certain areas.
*   **Interpretation of Article 22(4):** The Court's interpretation of Article 22(4) and its impact on the right of abode was a crucial element of the decision. The Court's finding that Article 22(4) does not qualify the right of abode for permanent residents was a significant victory for Hong Kong's autonomy.



This case remains a landmark decision in Hong Kong's constitutional jurisprudence, clarifying the scope of judicial review, the principles of Basic Law interpretation, and the limits of legislative power in the context of "one country, two systems." [end of text]
