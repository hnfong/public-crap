Okay, here's a breakdown of the *Ng Ka Ling v. Director of Immigration* case, addressing your requested tasks.

**1. Summary of Facts**

The case arose following the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to China on July 1, 1997. The core issue concerned the interpretation of Article 24 of the Basic Law, which defines who qualifies as a "permanent resident" of Hong Kong and, consequently, who has the "right of abode." Several individuals (Ng Ka Ling, Ng Tan Tan, Tsui Kuen Nang, and Cheung Lai Wah) entered Hong Kong around the handover date and asserted their right of abode based on being Chinese nationals with at least one parent who was a Hong Kong permanent resident.

The Director of Immigration, however, refused to recognize their right of abode, citing a newly implemented scheme under the Immigration (Amendment) (No. 3) Ordinance 1997 (No. 3 Ordinance). This ordinance required individuals claiming permanent resident status by descent (specifically, those born outside Hong Kong to a parent who was a permanent resident) to possess a "certificate of entitlement" affixed to a valid travel document, issued by the Director and approved by Mainland Chinese authorities.  The applicants had not obtained this certificate.  Cheung Lai Wah's case also involved the added complexity of being born out of wedlock.

The applicants initially sought judicial review, which was dismissed by the trial judge, with the exception of Cheung's case regarding her birth out of wedlock. The Court of Appeal upheld the lower court's decisions, further solidifying the Director's position.  The applicants then appealed to the Court of Final Appeal.

**2. Summary of Arguments**

*   **Applicants (Ng Ka Ling, Ng Tan Tan, Tsui Kuen Nang, and Cheung Lai Wah):**
    *   They argued that they met the criteria for permanent residency under Article 24(2) of the Basic Law and, therefore, were entitled to the right of abode under Article 24(3).
    *   They contended that the No. 3 Ordinance, particularly the requirement of a certificate of entitlement, was unconstitutional as it imposed an unreasonable and discriminatory restriction on their fundamental right of abode.
    *   They argued that the scheme effectively required them to seek approval from Mainland Chinese authorities, undermining Hong Kong's autonomy.
    *   In Cheung's case, they argued that her birth out of wedlock should not disqualify her from permanent residency.
*   **Director of Immigration:**
    *   He argued that the No. 3 Ordinance was a valid exercise of legislative power, necessary to verify claims of permanent residency and manage immigration flows.
    *   He asserted that Article 22(4) of the Basic Law, which deals with entry requirements for people from other parts of China, qualified the right of abode, allowing for Mainland approval processes.
    *   He maintained that the scheme was consistent with the Basic Law and did not unduly infringe on the applicants' rights.
    *   Regarding Cheung's case, he argued that the relevant provisions of the Immigration Ordinance discriminated between children born in and out of wedlock, a distinction permissible under Hong Kong law.

**3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The Court of Final Appeal's judgment established several significant legal principles, particularly concerning the interpretation of the Basic Law and the relationship between Hong Kong and Mainland China. Here's a detailed breakdown:

*   **Constitutional Jurisdiction of Hong Kong Courts:** The Court definitively affirmed that the courts of Hong Kong have the jurisdiction to interpret the Basic Law, including the power to examine acts of the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee for consistency with the Basic Law. This was a reversal of a previous decision (*HKSAR v Ma Wai Kwan David*) which had limited this power. The Court emphasized that this jurisdiction is essential for upholding the principle of "one country, two systems" and ensuring the Region's autonomy.
*   **Approach to Interpreting the Basic Law:** The Court adopted a purposive approach to interpreting the Basic Law, emphasizing the need to consider the document's overall purpose, context, and relevant extrinsic materials (including the Joint Declaration).  A generous interpretation was to be applied to provisions guaranteeing fundamental rights and freedoms.
*   **Article 158 and the Power of Interpretation:** The Court clarified the operation of Article 158, which governs the interpretation of the Basic Law. It distinguished between the power of lower courts and the Court of Final Appeal. The Court of Final Appeal is required to seek an interpretation from the Standing Committee only when interpreting provisions concerning affairs of the Central Government or the relationship between the Central Authorities and the Region, and only if such interpretation would affect the judgment in the case. The Court emphasized that the power to interpret provisions within the Region's autonomy rests primarily with the Hong Kong courts.
*   **Article 22(4) and the Right of Abode:** The Court held that Article 22(4), concerning entry requirements for people from other parts of China, *does not* qualify the right of abode for permanent residents of Hong Kong. The Court reasoned that permanent residents, by definition, are not "people from other parts of China" seeking entry for settlement. The Court rejected the Director's argument that Article 22(4) provided a constitutional basis for the certificate of entitlement scheme.
*   **Unconstitutionality of the No. 3 Ordinance:**  The Court declared the No. 3 Ordinance, to the extent it required permanent residents to hold a certificate of entitlement to exercise their right of abode, to be unconstitutional. This was because it imposed an unreasonable and discriminatory restriction on a fundamental right guaranteed by the Basic Law. The Court ordered the excision of specific sections of the Ordinance.
*   **Retrospective Application of the No. 3 Ordinance:** The Court found the retrospective application of the No. 3 Ordinance (section 1(2)) to be unconstitutional. This is because it effectively criminalized actions (entering and remaining in Hong Kong) that were lawful prior to the ordinance's effective date.
*   **Birth Out of Wedlock and Permanent Residency:** The Court held that the provision in the Immigration Ordinance (Schedule 1, para 1(2)(b)) that discriminated against children born out of wedlock in determining permanent residency was unconstitutional. The Court reasoned that such discrimination was inconsistent with the principles of equality enshrined in the Basic Law and the ICCPR.
*   **PLC's Legitimacy:** The Court found that the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) was a legally constituted body, established in accordance with the National People's Congress's decision based on the 1990 Decision. The Court found that the PLC's formation was consistent with the Basic Law.

**Novel/Controversial Points:**

*   **The Scope of Judicial Review over National Legislation:** The Court's reaffirmation of the Hong Kong courts' power to review acts of the National People's Congress was a significant and potentially controversial point. It challenged the previous restrictive interpretation and asserted the importance of judicial independence in safeguarding Hong Kong's autonomy.
*   **The Interpretation of Article 22(4):** The Court's rejection of the Director's argument regarding Article 22(4) was crucial in upholding the right of abode for permanent residents. This interpretation affirmed the principle that permanent residents are not subject to the same entry restrictions as other Chinese citizens.
*   **The Retrospective Application of Laws:** The Court's finding that the retrospective application of the No. 3 Ordinance was unconstitutional reinforced the principle that laws should not be applied retroactively to criminalize past conduct.



**4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects**

*   **The Political Context:** The case occurred shortly after the handover of Hong Kong to China, making it a pivotal moment in defining the relationship between the Region and the Mainland. The case was highly politically charged, with significant implications for immigration policy and the future of Hong Kong's autonomy.
*   **The Complex Legal Framework:** The case involved navigating a complex web of legal instruments, including the Chinese Constitution, the Basic Law, the Joint Declaration, Hong Kong legislation (the Immigration Ordinance), and international treaties (the ICCPR).
*   **The Impact on Immigration Policy:** The Court's decision had a direct and immediate impact on immigration policy, effectively dismantling the certificate of entitlement scheme and allowing permanent residents to freely enter and remain in Hong Kong.
*   **The Court's Boldness:** The Court's willingness to challenge the interpretation of national legislation and assert the independence of the Hong Kong judiciary demonstrated a remarkable degree of judicial courage in a sensitive political environment. [end of text]
