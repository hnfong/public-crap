**Sec. 71101**
The Secretary of Health and Human Services is prohibited from implementing, administering, or enforcing specific amendments to 42 Code of Federal Regulations regarding Medicare Savings Program eligibility and enrollment that were published by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on September 21, 2023. This moratorium applies to five specific regulatory sections (406.21(c), 435.4, 435.601, 435.911, and 435.952) and remains in effect from the date of enactment until September 30, 2034. To support these provisions, $1,000,000 is appropriated to the CMS Administrator for fiscal year 2026 to remain available until expended.

**Sec. 71102**
The Secretary of Health and Human Services is barred from implementing rules related to Medicaid, CHIP, and the Basic Health Program application and enrollment processes published by CMS on April 2, 2024. This prohibition covers 19 specific sections across 42 CFR Parts 431, 435, 447, and 457 and lasts until September 30, 2034. The measure effectively freezes the implementation of the "Streamlining" rule changes for these programs for a decade.

**Sec. 71103**
This section mandates that states establish a system by October 1, 2029, to prevent individuals from being simultaneously enrolled in Medicaid or CHIP plans across multiple states using Social Security numbers and address data. States must begin collecting address information from enrollees by January 1, 2027, and submit monthly data to a new federal system to identify and disenroll individuals residing in other states. The federal government appropriates $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2026 to establish this system and $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2029 for its maintenance.

**Sec. 71104**
Beginning January 1, 2027, states must conduct quarterly screenings against the Death Master File to identify and immediately disenroll deceased individuals from Medicaid, discontinuing all future payments for them. If an individual is erroneously identified as deceased, the state must immediately re-enroll them retroactively to the date of the mistaken disenrollment. This requirement applies to all 50 states and the District of Columbia to prevent payments to deceased beneficiaries.

**Sec. 71105**
Starting January 1, 2028, states must check the Death Master File quarterly during provider enrollment and revalidation to ensure deceased providers or suppliers do not remain enrolled in Medicaid. This amendment to the Social Security Act requires states to screen against the file as part of the initial enrollment process and subsequent periodic reviews. The goal is to prevent federal funds from being paid to providers who are no longer alive.

**Sec. 71106**
This section expands the definition of erroneous excess payments under Medicaid to include payments where insufficient information is available to confirm eligibility, in addition to payments for ineligible individuals. Beginning with fiscal year 2030, the Secretary may waive payment reductions for states only if the erroneous excess payments exceed the allowable error rate of 0.03 percent. The provision also allows the Secretary to conduct audits or authorize states to conduct audits to identify these errors.

**Sec. 71107**
States must conduct eligibility redeterminations for certain expansion individuals every six months starting in the first quarter after December 31, 2026. This requirement applies to individuals enrolled under the Medicaid expansion (section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII)) and those in waivers providing equivalent coverage. To assist states in implementing this change, $75,000,000 is appropriated to the CMS Administrator for fiscal year 2026.

**Sec. 71108**
Effective January 1, 2028, states may elect to increase the home equity limit for Medicaid long-term care eligibility from $500,000 to up to $1,000,000 for non-agricultural homes, while agricultural homes remain subject to the higher limit. States are explicitly prohibited from determining eligibility for nursing facility services without applying this home equity limit. The amendment clarifies that the limit applies to all long-term care services and sets a maximum cap of $1,000,000.

**Sec. 71109**
Beginning October 1, 2026, federal Medicaid payments are restricted to individuals who are U.S. citizens, nationals, lawful permanent residents, Cuban/Haitian entrants, or those under a Compact of Free Association. This provision excludes temporary visitors, tourists, diplomats, and students from eligibility for federal Medicaid funding. The section also applies similar restrictions to CHIP, with an exception for specific family planning services. $15,000,000 is appropriated for fiscal year 2026 to implement these changes.

**Sec. 71110**
Starting October 1, 2026, the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) for emergency Medicaid services provided to ineligible aliens is capped at the standard FMAP rate for that state, rather than the higher rate previously allowed. This change reduces the federal share of costs for emergency care provided to aliens who do not meet the eligibility criteria established in the previous section. $1,000,000 is appropriated for fiscal year 2026 to support the implementation of this funding adjustment.

**Sec. 71111**
The Secretary of Health and Human Services is prohibited from implementing staffing standards for long-term care facilities under Medicare and Medicaid that were published by CMS on May 10, 2024. This moratorium covers two specific sections of 42 CFR Part 483 (483.5 and 483.35) and remains in effect until September 30, 2034. The measure prevents the enforcement of new minimum staffing requirements for nursing homes and other long-term care facilities for a decade.

**Sec. 71112**
This section reduces the retroactive coverage period for Medicaid and CHIP, limiting eligibility for care furnished before application to one month prior for expansion individuals and two months prior for others. Previously, coverage could extend back three months; this change applies to applications made on or after the first quarter following December 31, 2026. $10,000,000 is appropriated for fiscal year 2026 to assist states in adjusting their systems to these new retroactive coverage limits.

**Sec. 71113**
Federal Medicaid funds cannot be used to make payments to "prohibited entities" for a one-year period starting from the enactment of the Act. A prohibited entity is defined as a 501(c)(3) organization primarily engaged in family planning or reproductive health that provided abortions (except for rape, incest, or life endangerment) and received over $800,000 in federal and state Medicaid expenditures in fiscal year 2023. This ban applies to direct payments and payments made through managed care entities or prepaid health plans.

**Sec. 71114**
The increased Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (FMAP) incentive for states that expanded Medicaid coverage is sunsetted for states that began expending amounts for expansion individuals prior to January 1, 2026. This amendment effectively removes the enhanced federal funding match for states that expanded early, aligning their FMAP with standard rates. The change targets the financial incentive structure for Medicaid expansion states.

**Sec. 71115**
This section lowers the threshold for the "hold harmless" provision regarding broad-based health care related taxes, reducing the applicable percent for expansion states from 6 percent to a sliding scale starting at 5.5 percent in 2028 and decreasing to 3.5 percent by 2032. Non-expansion states are subject to a 0 percent threshold if they do not have an existing tax, or their current determined rate if they do. The changes apply only to the 50 states and the District of Columbia, excluding territories.

**Sec. 71116**
State directed payments for services in Medicaid managed care are capped at 100 percent of the Medicare payment rate for expansion states and 110 percent for non-expansion states, effective for rating periods beginning on or after the date of enactment. Existing payments with prior approval before May 1, 2025, or for rural hospitals, are grandfathered but must be reduced by 10 percentage points annually starting January 1, 2028, until they reach the new cap. $7,000,000 is appropriated for each fiscal year from 2026 through 2033 to support this transition.

**Sec. 71117**
This section tightens the requirements for Medicaid provider taxes by defining "generally redistributive" taxes to exclude those that impose lower rates on taxpayers with lower Medicaid volume or higher rates based on Medicaid units. It introduces new definitions for "Medicaid taxable units" and "non-Medicaid taxable units" to prevent states from structuring taxes that disproportionately burden non-Medicaid payers. The amendments take effect upon enactment, with a transition period of up to three fiscal years.

**Sec. 71118**
Beginning January 1, 2027, the Secretary of Health and Human Services cannot approve Medicaid demonstration projects under Section 1115 unless the Chief Actuary certifies that the project will not increase federal expenditures compared to the status quo. This budget neutrality requirement applies to all new, renewed, or amended waivers and includes expenditures for services that could have been provided under the standard state plan. $5,000,000 is appropriated for each of fiscal years 2026 and 2027 to implement this rule.

**Sec. 71119**
States must require "applicable individuals" (non-disabled, non-pregnant adults aged 19-65 in the Medicaid expansion) to demonstrate 80 hours of community engagement per month, such as work, community service, or education, to maintain eligibility. Exceptions are provided for specific groups like parents, veterans, and those with disabilities, and states may grant exemptions for short-term hardships like natural disasters or serious illness. States must verify compliance using reliable data sources and may disenroll non-compliant individuals after a 30-day notice period. $200,000,000 is appropriated for fiscal year 2026 to help states build the necessary systems.

**Sec. 71120**
Beginning October 1, 2028, states may impose cost-sharing charges on "specified individuals" (expansion enrollees with income above the poverty line), but premiums are prohibited. Cost-sharing is limited to $35 per item or service, excluding primary care, mental health, and substance use disorder services, and the total annual cost-sharing for a family cannot exceed 5 percent of their income. States must establish these rules for individuals enrolled under the Medicaid expansion or equivalent waivers. $15,000,000 is appropriated for fiscal year 2026 to support implementation.

**Sec. 71121**
This section allows states to apply for standalone Section 1915(c) waivers to provide home and community-based services (HCBS) to individuals who do not meet the traditional institutional level-of-care requirement. States must demonstrate that these waivers will not increase wait times for other waiver recipients and that per capita expenditures for HCBS will not exceed the cost of institutional care. $50,000,000 is appropriated for fiscal year 2026 and $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2027 to support state systems for delivering these services.

**Sec. 71201**
Medicare benefits are restricted to U.S. citizens, nationals, lawful permanent residents, Cuban/Haitian entrants, and those under a Compact of Free Association, excluding other aliens. Individuals currently enrolled who do not meet these criteria will have their benefits terminated 18 months after the date of enactment, following a review by the Social Security Commissioner. The Commissioner must notify affected individuals of the impending termination as soon as practicable after identification.

**Sec. 71202**
A temporary 2.5 percent payment increase is added to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule for services furnished between January 1, 2026, and January 1, 2027. This increase is in addition to the existing updates for 2021 through 2024, effectively extending the enhanced payment period to cover the 2026 calendar year. The amendment ensures that physician payments are adjusted to account for exceptional circumstances during this specific timeframe.

**Sec. 71203**
The Drug Price Negotiation Program is amended to exclude drugs treating one or more rare diseases or conditions, clarifying that a drug is excluded if it treats any rare disease, not just one. Additionally, drugs that were previously classified as orphan drugs but no longer meet the definition will remain excluded from negotiation for the first day after they cease to be orphan drugs. These changes apply to initial price applicability years beginning on or after January 1, 2028.

**Sec. 71301**
Premium tax credits are restricted to individuals who are lawfully present and are "eligible aliens," defined as lawful permanent residents, Cuban/Haitian entrants, or those under a Compact of Free Association. This change disallows credits for aliens who are lawfully present but do not meet these specific immigration status criteria. The amendments apply to plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2027, and taxable years beginning after December 31, 2026.

**Sec. 71302**
Premium tax credits are disallowed for any period during which an individual is ineligible for Medicaid specifically due to their alien status. This provision closes a loophole where individuals could receive subsidies while being barred from Medicaid based on immigration status. The change applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

**Sec. 71303**
Exchanges must verify an applicant's eligibility for enrollment and premium tax credits, including household income, family size, alien status, and place of residence, before a month can be counted as a "coverage month." A pre-enrollment verification process must be established by August 1 to allow applicants to verify their eligibility for the subsequent plan year. These requirements apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2027.

**Sec. 71304**
Premium tax credits are disallowed for plans enrolled in during a special enrollment period based solely on expected household income relative to the poverty line, unless the enrollment is connected to a specific qualifying life event. This restriction targets special enrollment periods that allow enrollment based on income projections without a triggering event. The change applies to plan years beginning after December 31, 2025.

**Sec. 71305**
The limitation on the recapture of advance payments of the premium tax credit is eliminated, meaning taxpayers must repay the full amount of advance payments that exceed their actual credit entitlement. This change removes the cap on repayment amounts that previously protected taxpayers from owing more than a certain percentage of their income. The amendment applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025.

**Sec. 71306**
The safe harbor allowing Health Savings Account (HSA) eligible high-deductible health plans to offer telehealth services without a deductible is made permanent. This provision ensures that plans do not lose their HSA-eligible status simply because they waive the deductible for remote care services. The amendment applies to plan years beginning after December 31, 2024.

**Sec. 71307**
Bronze and catastrophic plans available through an Exchange are now treated as high-deductible health plans for the purpose of Health Savings Account (HSA) eligibility. This change allows individuals enrolled in these lower-tier plans to contribute to an HSA, expanding access to tax-advantaged savings. The amendment applies to months beginning after December 31, 2025.

**Sec. 71308**
Direct primary care service arrangements are excluded from the definition of a health plan for HSA purposes, provided the fees do not exceed $150 per month (or $300 for family coverage). Fees paid for these arrangements are treated as deductible medical expenses for HSA purposes. The $150 limit is subject to inflation adjustments starting in 2026. The amendment applies to months beginning after December 31, 2025.

**Sec. 71401**
A $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program is established, appropriating $10 billion annually for fiscal years 2026 through 2030 to support rural hospitals and providers. States must submit a transformation plan by December 31, 2025, detailing strategies to improve access, outcomes, and financial stability, with funds allocated equally among states and based on rural population and facility counts. The program prohibits matching funds and allows states to use the money for workforce recruitment, technology adoption, and chronic disease management.

**Sec. 72001**
The limitation on the public debt is increased by $5,000,000,000,000 (five trillion dollars). This modification applies to the limit set forth in title 31, United States Code, effectively raising the federal borrowing ceiling by five trillion dollars. The increase is intended to provide additional borrowing authority for the federal government.

**Sec. 73001**
Federal funds are prohibited from being used to pay unemployment compensation benefits to individuals whose wages during their base period equal or exceed $1,000,000. States must implement self-certification and verification systems to ensure claimants do not exceed this wage threshold and must recover any overpayments made in error. The prohibition applies to weeks of unemployment beginning on or after the date of enactment. [end of text]
