Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a summary of every section "Sec. XXXX" in this bill, starting from Sec. 50101. They specified that each section summary should be at most one paragraph, four sentences max, with specific details on parties, entities, and quantities. They also want it concise but not vague.

First, I need to parse the bill text provided. The bill is titled "An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of H. Con. Res. 14." It's a huge bill championed by President Trump, passed by Congress in 2025. The user provided the entire bill text, so I need to go through each section starting from 50101.

Let me start with Sec. 50101. The section is about Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing. The key points here are the repeal of Inflation Reduction Act provisions, requiring immediate resumption of quarterly lease sales, and specific states involved. The user wants specific entities and quantities. So, I need to note that the Inflation Reduction Act's subsections (a) and (e) of section 50262 are repealed. Then, the Secretary of the Interior must resume quarterly lease sales in specific states: Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Nevada, Alaska. The requirement is 50% of available parcels from resource management plans. Also, the amendment to the Mineral Leasing Act defines "eligible lands" and "available" lands. I need to make sure to mention the Secretary of the Interior, the states, the 50% requirement, and the repeal of specific sections.

Next, Sec. 50102 is Offshore Oil and Gas Leasing. There are two regions: Gulf of America and Alaska. The Gulf requires 30 lease sales with specific timing (1 by Dec 15, 2025; 2 per year from 2026-2039; 1 in 2040). The Alaska region needs 6 lease sales between 2026-2028 and 2030-2032. Royalty rates are set between 12.5% and 16.67%. For the Gulf, 80 million acres per sale; Alaska, 1 million acres. Also, 70% of revenues go to Alaska starting in 2034. Need to specify the Secretary of the Interior, the regions, the number of sales, acreage, royalty rates, and revenue sharing.

Sec. 50103 is Royalties on Extracted Methane, which repeals Section 50263 of the Inflation Reduction Act. So, the key point here is the repeal, no specific entities or quantities beyond that. Just state it's repealed.

Sec. 50104 is Alaska Oil and Gas Leasing. Requires 4 lease sales area-wide within 10 years, starting 1 year after enactment. Each sale must offer at least 400,000 acres with high hydrocarbon potential. Revenue sharing: 50% to Alaska for 2025-2033, 70% from 2034 onwards. The Secretary of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, and the State of Alaska are involved here.

Sec. 50105 is National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska. Restores and resumes lease sales under the Program. Requires 5 lease sales within 10 years, each offering at least 4 million acres. Terms based on the NPR-A final EIS and record of decision. Revenue sharing: 70% to Alaska from 2034 onwards. The Secretary of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, and State of Alaska again.

Moving to Subtitle B, Mining. Sec. 50201 is Coal Leasing. Requires the Secretary to process qualified applications within 90 days: publish environmental reviews, set fair market value, hold lease sales, and grant leases. Qualified applications are those pending or submitted within 90 days of enactment. The Bureau of Land Management is the entity here.

Sec. 50202 is Coal Royalty. Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to set the royalty rate at 12.5%, but not more than 7% until 2034. Applies to existing leases not terminated. Also, advance royalties get a credit for the difference. The Secretary of the Interior handles this.

Sec. 50203 is Leases for Known Recoverable Coal Resources. Requires making 4 million additional acres available for lease in 48 states and Alaska, excluding certain protected areas. The Secretary of the Interior must do this within 90 days. The excluded areas are National Monuments, Wilderness, etc.

Sec. 50204 is Authorization to Mine Federal Coal. Allows mining Federal coal adjacent to State/private land if it's economically viable. The Secretary must authorize within 90 days without substantial modification. NEPA still applies.

Subtitle C, Lands. Sec. 50301 is Timber Sales and Long-Term Contracting. For Forest Service, 250 million board-feet more each year from 2026-2034. For BLM, 20 million board-feet more annually. Long-term contracts: 40 for Forest Service (20+ years), 5 for BLM (20+ years). Receipts go to the Treasury.

Sec. 50302 is Renewable Energy Fees on Federal Land. Acreage rent calculated as Per-Acre Rate × Encumbrance Factor × (1 + Annual Adjustment Factor)^D. Capacity fee is 3.9% of gross proceeds or acreage rent, with a 10% reduction for wind if 25% land is multi-use. The Secretary (Interior or Agriculture) collects these.

Sec. 50303 is Renewable Energy Revenue Sharing. 25% to the State, 25% to counties based on land percentage. Payments start Jan 1, 2026. The Secretary handles the allocation.

Sec. 50304 is Rescission of NPS and BLM Funds. Rescinds unobligated balances from sections 50221, 50222, 50223 of the Inflation Reduction Act.

Sec. 50305 is Celebrating America's 250th Anniversary. $150 million for NPS events, available through 2028.

Subtitle D, Energy. Sec. 50401 is Strategic Petroleum Reserve. $218 million for maintenance, $171 million for petroleum acquisition. Repeals the drawdown mandate.

Sec. 50402 is Repeals; Resciissions. Repeals Section 50142 of the Inflation Reduction Act and rescinds unobligated balances from several sections.

Sec. 50403 is Energy Dominance Financing. Amends Section 1706 of the Energy Policy Act to include grid reliability. $1 billion for fiscal 2025, 3% for admin costs. Extends commitment authority to 2028.

Sec. 50404 is Transformational AI Models. $150 million for AI models via the American Science Cloud. Focus on microelectronics and new energy tech.

Subtitle E, Water. Sec. 50501 is Water Conveyance and Storage. $1 billion for Reclamation projects, no matching requirements.

Now, I need to make sure each section summary is one paragraph, max four sentences, specific on entities and quantities. Let me check each one.

Now, check if each summary is within 4 sentences, specific. Let's draft each one.

Starting with Sec. 50101:

Sec. 50101 repeals Inflation Reduction Act provisions on onshore oil and gas royalty rates and noncompetitive leasing, restoring pre-2022 rules. The Secretary of the Interior must immediately resume quarterly onshore lease sales in Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Nevada, and Alaska, offering at least 50% of nominated parcels under resource management plans. The Mineral Leasing Act is amended to define "eligible lands" and "available" lands, requiring timely environmental reviews and scoping. This mandates increased leasing activity to boost domestic energy production and federal revenue.

Wait, the user said "at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences." So four sentences max. Let me count: 4 sentences. Good.

Sec. 50102:

Sec. 50102 mandates 30 Gulf of America offshore lease sales (1 by December 15, 2025; 2 annually 2026–2039; 1 in 2040) offering 80 million acres each, and 6 Alaska Cook Inlet sales (1 annually 2026–2028 and 2030–2032) offering 1 million acres each. Royalty rates are set at 12.5%–16.67% for Gulf sales and 12.5%–16.67% for Alaska sales, with 70% of Alaska lease revenues paid to the State of Alaska starting in 2034. The Secretary of the Interior must use lease forms and terms from specific 2020 and 2017 Bureau of Ocean Energy Management notices.

Check quantities: 30 sales, 80M acres, 6 sales, 1M acres, 12.5-16.67%, 70% to Alaska from 2034. Entities: Secretary, Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. Good.

Sec. 50103:

Sec. 50103 repeals Section 50263 of the Inflation Reduction Act, which previously imposed royalties on extracted methane. No further details or entities are specified, so the summary is straightforward.

Sec. 50104:

Sec. 50104 requires the Secretary of the Interior to conduct four Alaska oil and gas lease sales within 10 years, each offering at least 400,000 acres of high-potential hydrocarbon areas, starting one year after enactment. Revenue sharing allocates 50% of receipts to the State of Alaska for fiscal years 2025–2033 and 70% thereafter. The leases must follow terms from the 2020 Coastal Plain Record of Decision, and rights-of-way and surface development provisions apply. This aims to expand Alaska’s oil and gas leasing while increasing state revenue.

Check: 4 sales, 400k acres, 50% until 2033, 70% after, Secretary, BLM, State of Alaska. Good.

Sec. 50105:

Sec. 50105 directs the Secretary of the Interior to restore and resume National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) oil and gas lease sales, conducting at least five sales within 10 years, each offering 4 million acres. Lease terms must align with the 2020 NPR-A Final Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision. Revenue sharing shifts to 70% for the State of Alaska starting in fiscal year 2034, up from prior allocations. This reinstates NPR-A leasing after prior restrictions.

Check: 5 sales, 4M acres each, 70% to Alaska from 2034, Secretary, NPR-A. Correct.

Subtitle B, Sec. 50201:

Sec. 50201 requires the Secretary of the Interior (via Bureau of Land Management) to process all qualified coal lease applications within 90 days, including environmental reviews, fair market value assessments, and lease sales, with the highest bidder granted the lease. Qualified applications include those pending or submitted within 90 days of enactment with environmental reviews commenced or commencable within 90 days. This accelerates coal leasing by streamlining BLM’s approval process. The goal is to increase coal production and federal revenue from existing applications.

Check: 90 days, BLM, qualified applications, highest bidder. Good.

Sec. 50202:

Sec. 50202 amends the Mineral Leasing Act to set coal royalties at 12.5%, but not exceeding 7% until September 30, 2034, applying to all existing unterminated coal leases. The Secretary must provide advance royalty credits for lessees who paid higher rates before enactment. This reduces coal royalty rates to boost industry competitiveness while maintaining federal revenue. The change affects all coal leases under the Mineral Leasing Act.

Check: 12.5% max, 7% until 2034, applies to existing leases, credit for advance royalties. Correct.

Sec. 50203:

Sec. 50203 mandates the Secretary of the Interior to make 4 million additional acres of known recoverable coal available for leasing in the 48 contiguous states and Alaska within 90 days, excluding National Monuments, Wilderness, and other protected areas. The provision targets coal resources not previously subject to leasing under the Mineral Leasing Act. This expands federal coal leasing opportunities while respecting conservation designations. The Secretary must exclude lands within 9 specific protected categories.

Check: 4M acres, 48 states and Alaska, 9 excluded categories. Correct.

Sec. 50204:

Sec. 50204 authorizes mining Federal coal adjacent to State or private land if economically viable, requiring the Secretary of the Interior to approve such mining within 90 days without substantial modification. The provision does not override National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements. This aims to facilitate access to Federal coal reserves adjacent to private or state lands. The Secretary must act within 90 days to enable mining operations.

Check: 90 days, Secretary, NEPA applies. Good.

Subtitle C, Sec. 50301:

Sec. 50301 requires the Forest Service to sell 250 million board-feet more timber annually (2026–2034) and the Bureau of Land Management to sell 20 million board-feet more annually, both subject to resource plans. It mandates 40 long-term timber contracts (20+ years) for the Forest Service and 5 for BLM, with all receipts deposited in the Treasury. This increases timber sales and long-term contracting to boost federal revenue from forest and public lands.

Check: 250M board-feet, 20M, 40 contracts, 5 contracts, receipts to Treasury. Correct.

Sec. 50302:

Sec. 50302 establishes renewable energy fees on federal land, calculating acreage rent as Per-Acre Rate × Encumbrance Factor × (1 + 3%)^D, with capacity fees at 3.9% of gross proceeds or acreage rent. Wind projects may qualify for a 10% capacity fee reduction if 25% of land is multi-use. The Secretary (Interior or Agriculture) collects these fees until energy production begins. This creates new revenue streams for renewable energy projects on federal lands.

Check: 3% annual adjustment, 10% reduction for wind, Secretary collects. Good.

Sec. 50303:

Sec. 50303 allocates 25% of renewable energy revenue to the State and 25% to counties based on land percentage, starting January 1, 2026. Payments are made from the Treasury without further appropriation, with county payments in addition to existing tax payments. The Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture administers the allocation. This ensures local communities benefit from renewable energy projects on federal lands.

Check: 25% to State, 25% to counties, 2026 start, Secretary. Correct.

Sec. 50304:

Sec. 50304 rescinds unobligated balances from Inflation Reduction Act sections 50221, 50222, and 50223, totaling funds previously allocated to National Park Service and Bureau of Land Management programs. This reduces funding for certain environmental and conservation initiatives. The rescission applies to unobligated balances as of the bill’s enactment date. The provision aligns with broader budget cuts to IRA programs.

Check: Sections 50221-50223, rescind unobligated balances. Correct.

Sec. 50305:

Sec. 50305 appropriates $150 million for the National Park Service to fund 250th-anniversary events, available through fiscal year 2028. The funds are for celebrations and commemorations of the U.S. founding. This is in addition to existing appropriations. The funding is non-reimbursable and not subject to matching requirements.

Check: $150M, NPS, 2025-2028. Correct.

Subtitle D, Sec. 50401:

Sec. 50401 appropriates $218 million for Strategic Petroleum Reserve maintenance and $171 million for petroleum acquisition, repealing the drawdown and sale mandate in Public Law 115-97. The funds are available until September 30, 2029. This strengthens the SPR’s capacity and readiness for future energy crises. The Secretary of Energy manages these appropriations.

Check: $218M, $171M, repeal drawdown mandate. Correct.

Sec. 50402:

Sec. 50402 repeals Section 50142 of the Inflation Reduction Act and rescinds unobligated balances from eight IRA sections (50123, 50141, 50144, 50145, 50151, 50152, 50153, 50161). This eliminates funding for certain clean energy programs. The rescission applies to unobligated balances as of the bill’s enactment. The provision reduces federal spending on renewable energy initiatives.

Check: Repeal Section 50142, rescind 8 sections. Correct.

Sec. 50403:

Sec. 50403 amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to include grid reliability support in energy financing, appropriating $1 billion for fiscal year 2025 (3% for administrative costs) to enhance energy infrastructure. It extends the commitment authority end date from 2026 to 2028. The Secretary of Energy administers the funding. This supports energy dominance and grid stability.

Check: $1B, 3% admin, extend to 2028. Correct.

Sec. 50404:

Sec. 50404 appropriates $150 million for transformational AI models via the American Science Cloud, focusing on microelectronics and new energy technologies. The funds are available through September 30, 2026. The Department of Energy’s National Laboratories partner with industry to develop AI models. This aims to accelerate scientific innovation in energy and computing.

Check: $150M, American Science Cloud, 2026 end. Correct.

Subtitle E, Sec. 50501:

Sec. 50501 appropriates $1 billion for Bureau of Reclamation water conveyance and storage projects, with no matching or cost-sharing requirements. The funds are available through September 30, 2034. Projects must restore or increase capacity of existing facilities. This supports water infrastructure improvements without additional state or local funding.

Check: $1B, no matching, 2034 end. Correct.

Now, check each summary for conciseness, specific entities, quantities, and within 4 sentences. Let me verify a few more.

Sec. 50101: 4 sentences. Correct.

Sec. 50102: 4 sentences. Good.

Sec. 50103: 1 sentence. Correct.

Sec. 50104: 4 sentences. Wait, the user said "at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences. Minimum 1 sentence." So 4 is okay.

Wait, the user said "For every Section ("Sec."), give at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences. Minimum 1 sentence." So each section should be 1-4 sentences. Let me check each.

Sec. 50103 is one sentence, which is okay.

Sec. 50304: "Sec. 50304 rescinds unobligated balances from Inflation Reduction Act sections 50221, 50222, and 50223, totaling funds previously allocated to National Park Service and Bureau of Land Management programs. This reduces funding for certain environmental and conservation initiatives. The rescission applies to unobligated balances as of the bill’s enactment date. The provision aligns with broader budget cuts to IRA programs."

That's four sentences. Good.

Wait, but the user said "at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences." So four sentences is acceptable.

I think this covers all sections. Let me make sure I didn't miss any. The bill has sections from 50101 to 50501, grouped under the subtitles. The user provided all the sections, so I need to cover each one. Let me count the sections listed in the bill:

Title V, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources:

Subtitle A: 50101-50105

Subtitle B: 50201-50204

Subtitle C: 50301-50305

Subtitle D: 50401-50404

Subtitle E: 50501

So total 15 sections. Let me check if I have all 15.

Yes, 50101 to 50105 (5), 50201-50204 (4), 50301-50305 (5), 50401-50404 (4), 50501 (1). Total 19 sections. Wait, the user listed up to Sec. 50501, so 19 sections. Let me confirm the list:

Sec. 50101, 50102, 50103, 50104, 50105,

50201, 50202, 50203, 50204,

50301, 50302, 50303, 50304, 50305,

50401, 50402, 50403, 50404,

50501.

Yes, 19 sections. I have summaries for all 19. Let me check if each is covered.

Yes, the user provided all the sections, and I've addressed each one. Now, ensure that all key details are included: parties (Secretary of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management, State of Alaska, etc.), quantities (400,000 acres, 12.5%, $150 million, etc.), and specific entities.

I think that's all. Now, format the response as per the user's instruction: start with Sec. 50101, each section in order, one paragraph max 4 sentences, specific details.

Wait, the user said "Start with Sec. 50101." So the response should list each section in order, starting from 50101. Let me make sure the order is correct as per the bill.

Yes, the bill lists Sec. 50101 to 50501 in order. So the response should follow that order.

Double-checking each section's summary for accuracy. For example, in Sec. 50102, the Gulf of America region requires 30 lease sales, with specific timing. The user mentioned "Gulf of america" in the text, but it's probably a typo for "Gulf of Mexico," but the bill says "Gulf of america," so I'll keep it as written.

Another check: Sec. 50202 says "12\1/2\ percent, except such amount shall be not more than 7 percent during the period that begins on the date of enactment of the Act entitled `An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to title II of H. Con. Res. 14' (119th Congress) and ends September 30, 2034," so the rate is 12.5%, but capped at 7% until 2034. So the summary says "12.5%, but not exceeding 7% until September 30, 2034." Correct.

Sec. 50302: "Encumbrance Factor: 100% for solar, 10%+ for wind." The summary says "Encumbrance Factor: 100% for solar, 10%+ for wind." Wait, the bill says "an amount determined by the Secretary, but not less than 10 percent for a wind energy generation facility." So the Encumbrance Factor for wind is not less than 10%, so the summary says "10% for wind," which is the minimum. So the summary is accurate.

Sec. 50303: "25% to the State, 25% to counties based on land percentage." Correct.

Okay, I think all the details are correctly captured. Now, time to write the response as per the instructions.

Sec. 50104 requires the Secretary of the Interior to conduct four Alaska oil and gas lease sales within 10 years, each offering at least 400,000 acres of high-potential hydrocarbon areas, starting one year after enactment. Revenue sharing allocates 50% of receipts to the State of Alaska for fiscal years 2025–2033 and 70% thereafter. The leases must follow terms from the 2020 Coastal Plain Record of Decision, with rights-of-way and surface development provisions applying.  

Sec. 50105 directs the Secretary of the Interior to restore and resume National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A) oil and gas lease sales, conducting at least five sales within 10 years, each offering 4 million acres. Lease terms must align with the 2020 NPR-A Final Environmental Impact Statement and Record of Decision. Revenue sharing shifts to 70% for the State of Alaska starting in fiscal year 2034.  

Sec. 50201 requires the Secretary of the Interior (via Bureau of Land Management) to process all qualified coal lease applications within 90 days, including environmental reviews, fair market value assessments, and lease sales, with the highest bidder granted the lease. Qualified applications include those pending or submitted within 90 days of enactment with environmental reviews commenced or commencable within 90 days. This accelerates coal leasing by streamlining BLM’s approval process.  

Sec. 50202 amends the Mineral Leasing Act to set coal royalties at 12.5%, but not exceeding 7% until September 30, 2034, applying to all existing unterminated coal leases. The Secretary must provide advance royalty credits for lessees who paid higher rates before enactment. This reduces coal royalty rates to boost industry competitiveness while maintaining federal revenue.  

Sec. 50203 mandates the Secretary of the Interior to make 4 million additional acres of known recoverable coal available for leasing in the 48 contiguous states and Alaska within 90 days, excluding National Monuments, Wilderness, and other protected areas. The provision targets coal resources not previously subject to leasing under the Mineral Leasing Act.  

Sec. 50204 authorizes mining Federal coal adjacent to State or private land if economically viable, requiring the Secretary of the Interior to approve such mining within 90 days without substantial modification. The provision does not override National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requirements.  

Sec. 50301 requires the Forest Service to sell 250 million board-feet more timber annually (2026–2034) and the Bureau of Land Management to sell 20 million board-feet more annually, both subject to resource plans. It mandates 40 long-term timber contracts (20+ years) for the Forest Service and 5 for BLM, with all receipts deposited in the Treasury.  

Sec. 50302 establishes renewable energy fees on federal land, calculating acreage rent as Per-Acre Rate × Encumbrance Factor × (1 + 3%)^D, with capacity fees at 3.9% of gross proceeds or acreage rent. Wind projects may qualify for a 10% capacity fee reduction if 25% of land is multi-use. The Secretary (Interior or Agriculture) collects these fees until energy production begins.  

Sec. 50303 allocates 25% of renewable energy revenue to the State and 25% to counties based on land percentage, starting January 1, 2026. Payments are made from the Treasury without further appropriation, with county payments in addition to existing tax payments. The Secretary of the Interior or Agriculture administers the allocation.  

Sec. 50304 rescinds unobligated balances from Inflation Reduction Act sections 50221, 50222, and 50223, totaling funds previously allocated to National Park Service and Bureau of Land Management programs. This reduces funding for certain environmental and conservation initiatives. The rescission applies to unobligated balances as of the bill’s enactment date.  

Sec. 50305 appropriates $150 million for the National Park Service to fund 250th-anniversary events, available through fiscal year 2028. The funds are for celebrations and commemorations of the U.S. founding. This is in addition to existing appropriations.  

Sec. 50401 appropriates $218 million for Strategic Petroleum Reserve maintenance and $171 million for petroleum acquisition, repealing the drawdown and sale mandate in Public Law 115-97. The funds are available until September 30, 2029. This strengthens the SPR’s capacity and readiness for future energy crises.  

Sec. 50402 repeals Section 50142 of the Inflation Reduction Act and rescinds unobligated balances from eight IRA sections (50123, 50141, 50144, 50145, 50151, 50152, 50153, 50161). This eliminates funding for certain clean energy programs. The rescission applies to unobligated balances as of the bill’s enactment.  

Sec. 50403 amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to include grid reliability support in energy financing, appropriating $1 billion for fiscal year 2025 (3% for administrative costs) to enhance energy infrastructure. It extends the commitment authority end date from 2026 to 2028. The Secretary of Energy administers the funding.  

Sec. 50404 appropriates $150 million for transformational AI models via the American Science Cloud, focusing on microelectronics and new energy technologies. The funds are available through September 30, 2026. The Department of Energy’s National Laboratories partner with industry to develop AI models.  

Sec. 50501 appropriates $1 billion for Bureau of Reclamation water conveyance and storage projects, with no matching or cost-sharing requirements. The funds are available through September 30, 2034. Projects must restore or increase capacity of existing facilities. [end of text]
