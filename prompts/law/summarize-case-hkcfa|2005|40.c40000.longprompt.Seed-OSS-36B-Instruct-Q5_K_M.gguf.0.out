Got it, let's tackle this case step by step. First, I need to remember the four tasks: facts, parties' arguments, legal principles (ratio), and something striking. Let's start with the facts because that's the foundation.

**Facts Summary**: The case is Leung Kwok Hung and Others v. HKSAR, involving challenges to the constitutionality of the Public Order Ordinance (POO) Cap. 245, specifically its regulation of public processions. The appellants were convicted of holding an unauthorized assembly after a procession on February 10, 2002, in Hong Kong. They didn't comply with the POO's notification requirement (needing to notify the Commissioner of Police one week in advance for processions over 30 people). The procession was peaceful, starting at Chater Garden, moving along Queensway, and ending at Police Headquarters. The appellants argued the POO's scheme for restricting processions via the Commissioner's discretion (to object or impose conditions on grounds including "public order (ordre public)") was unconstitutional.

**Parties' Arguments**: 
- **Appellants**: Challenged the constitutionality of the POO's statutory scheme, particularly the Commissioner's broad discretion to restrict processions for "public order (ordre public)" and "protection of the rights and freedoms of others." They argued these grounds were too vague and uncertain, violating the "prescribed by law" requirement under the Basic Law (Art. 39) and the ICCPR (incorporated via Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, Cap. 383). They also contended the notification requirement, when combined with the broad discretion, unconstitutionally restricted the right to peaceful assembly.
- **Respondent (Government)**: Defended the POO as compliant with constitutional requirements. Argued the notification scheme was necessary to enable the police to manage public order (e.g., traffic, crowd control) and fulfill their positive duty to protect lawful assemblies. They claimed the Commissioner's discretion was sufficiently constrained by statutory time limits, requirement to give reasons, and the right of appeal to the Appeal Board. They also argued "public order (ordre public)" was not unconstitutionally vague, relying on its interpretation under ICCPR principles.

**Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**: This is the most complex part. The Court (majority: Chief Justice Li, Chan, Ribeiro, Mason; dissent: Bokhary) focused on the right to peaceful assembly under the Basic Law (Art. 27) and ICCPR (Art. 21, incorporated via BORO Art. 17). Key principles:

1. **Fundamental Right to Peaceful Assembly**: The right is fundamental, closely linked to freedom of speech, and must be interpreted generously. Restrictions must be narrowly construed, with the burden on the government to justify them.

2. **Constitutional Requirements for Restrictions**: Any restriction on the right must satisfy two tests:
   - **"Prescribed by Law" Requirement**: The restriction must be sufficiently precise to enable citizens to regulate their conduct (legal certainty). Vague or overly broad discretions violate this, as they allow arbitrary interference with fundamental rights.
   - **Necessity Requirement**: Restrictions must be "necessary in a democratic society" for specified legitimate purposes (national security, public safety, public order, public health/morals, protection of others' rights). This involves a proportionality test: (a) the restriction must be rationally connected to a legitimate purpose; (b) it must be no more than necessary to achieve that purpose.

3. **Analysis of the POO's Discretion**: The majority held the Commissioner's discretion to restrict processions for "public order (ordre public)" (as defined in the POO) was unconstitutional because "public order (ordre public)" was too vague and uncertain at the statutory level, violating the "prescribed by law" requirement. However, they severed "public order (in the law and order sense—maintenance of public order, prevention of disorder)" from the broader "public order (ordre public)," holding the narrower "public order" was sufficiently certain and constitutional.

4. **Positive Duty of the Government**: The state has a positive duty to take reasonable measures to enable lawful assemblies to proceed peacefully (e.g., via notification to plan policing), but this duty is not absolute.

5. **Proportionality Test Application**: The majority emphasized that even valid statutory discretions must be subject to a proportionality test. The Commissioner must consider whether a restriction is rationally connected to a legitimate purpose and no more than necessary. This includes giving adequate reasons for objections/conditions, statutory time limits, and appeal rights.

6. **Severance Doctrine**: When part of a statute is unconstitutional, the court may sever the invalid part if the remainder can stand independently. Here, severing "public order (ordre public)" to leave "public order" (narrowly defined) was valid because the legislature would have intended the narrower term if it knew the broader one was unconstitutional.

7. **Dissent (Bokhary PJ)**: He went further, holding the entire scheme of prior restraint (Commissioner's power to prohibit/object to processions) was unconstitutional because the legitimate purposes (national security, public safety, public order, protection of others) were too broad and lacked sufficient constraints (e.g., no "clear and present danger" standard, no requirement to exhaust less restrictive means first). He argued prior restraint on fundamental rights requires stricter scrutiny and the POO failed that.

**Striking/Unusual Aspects**:
- **Split Decision**: The majority (4 judges) and dissent (1 judge) highlight deep divisions on the scope of the right to peaceful assembly and the validity of prior restraint mechanisms. Bokhary's dissent is particularly notable for its thorough critique of prior restraint, citing international jurisprudence (e.g., US Supreme Court cases on First Amendment, German Bundesverfassungsgericht) to argue the POO's broad discretions violated fundamental rights.
- **Severance of "Public Order"**: The majority's use of severance to narrow "public order (ordre public)" to its core law-and-order meaning is a practical approach to save part of the statute while striking down the overbroad provision. This balances statutory validity with constitutional rights.
- **Political Context**: The case arose from a peaceful protest against a political conviction, reflecting Hong Kong's political activism and the tension between governance (police need for control) and civil liberties.
- **International Jurisprudence Citation**: Both majority and dissent extensively cite international human rights cases (e.g., European Court of Human Rights, US Supreme Court, German constitutional court), showing the influence of global standards on Hong Kong's constitutional law post-1997.
- **Appellants' Motive**: The appellants deliberately engaged in an unauthorized procession to test the constitutionality of the POO, making this a "test case" for civil liberties, which is unusual but common in constitutional law to clarify rights.</seed:think>### 1. Brief Summary of Facts  
The case concerns a challenge to the constitutionality of the **Public Order Ordinance (POO), Cap. 245** in Hong Kong, which regulates public processions. The appellants (Leung Kwok Hung and others) were convicted of holding an unauthorized assembly after organizing a peaceful procession on February 10, 2002, to protest the conviction of an activist. The procession involved ~100 people, started at Chater Garden, and ended at Police Headquarters. They did not comply with the POO’s requirement to notify the Commissioner of Police one week in advance for processions of over 30 people. The core dispute was whether the POO’s scheme for restricting processions—specifically the Commissioner’s broad discretion to object to or impose conditions on processions for “public order (ordre public)” and “protection of the rights and freedoms of others”—violated the right to peaceful assembly under the Basic Law and Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (BORO).


### 2. Arguments of the Parties  
#### **Appellants**  
The appellants challenged the POO’s constitutionality on two main grounds:  
- **Vagueness of “Public Order (Ordre Public)”**: The Commissioner’s discretion to restrict processions for “public order (ordre public)” was too vague and uncertain, violating the “prescribed by law” requirement under the Basic Law (Art. 39) and ICCPR (incorporated via BORO Art. 17). They argued this lack of precision allowed arbitrary interference with the fundamental right to peaceful assembly.  
- **Overbreadth of Restrictions**: The combination of the mandatory notification requirement (one week’s notice) and the Commissioner’s broad discretion unconstitutionally chilled the exercise of free assembly, as citizens could not reasonably predict when their procession would be blocked.  

#### **Respondent (Government)**  
The Government defended the POO as compliant with constitutional standards:  
- **Legitimate Purpose**: The notification scheme was necessary to enable the police to manage public order (e.g., traffic, crowd control) and fulfill their **positive duty** to protect lawful assemblies (per international human rights jurisprudence).  
- **Constraints on Discretion**: The Commissioner’s discretion was not unlimited: it required giving written reasons for objections/conditions, operated within strict time limits, and was subject to appeal to an independent Appeal Board.  
- **“Public Order (Ordre Public)” Clarity**: The term was sufficiently defined by reference to ICCPR principles (per POO s. 2(2)) and did not violate legal certainty.  


### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The case clarified the constitutional framework for regulating the right to peaceful assembly in Hong Kong, with key principles derived from the Basic Law, BORO, and international human rights law:  

#### **a. Fundamental Right to Peaceful Assembly**  
The right to peaceful assembly (Basic Law Art. 27; BORO Art. 17) is a **core fundamental right**, closely linked to freedom of speech. Courts must interpret it *generously* to ensure full enjoyment, while restrictions on it must be *narrowly construed* (burden on the Government to justify).  

#### **b. Dual Constitutional Tests for Restrictions**  
Any restriction on the right to peaceful assembly must satisfy two mandatory requirements:  
1. **“Prescribed by Law” (Legal Certainty)**: The restriction must be sufficiently precise to enable citizens to understand what conduct is permitted. Vague or overly broad discretions violate this, as they allow arbitrary state interference (e.g., *Shum Kwok Sher v. HKSAR*).  
2. **Necessity in a Democratic Society**: Restrictions must be “necessary” to achieve one of the specified legitimate purposes (national security, public safety, public order, public health/morals, protection of others’ rights). This requires a **proportionality test**:  
   - *Rational Connection*: The restriction must target a legitimate purpose.  
   - *Minimal Impairment*: The restriction must be no more than necessary to achieve that purpose (i.e., less restrictive means should be exhausted first).  

#### **c. “Public Order (Ordre Public)” Is Unconstitutionally Vague**  
The majority held the Commissioner’s discretion to restrict processions for “public order (ordre public)” (as defined in the POO) violated the “prescribed by law” requirement. While “public order” is a valid constitutional concept, the POO’s statutory use of “public order (ordre public)” was too broad (encompassing abstract “principles of society” beyond mere law-and-order), lacking the precision needed to guide citizens or constrain executive discretion.  

#### **d. Severance of “Public Order”**  
To save the POO from total invalidity, the Court applied the **severance doctrine**: it struck down the broad “public order (ordre public)” but upheld the narrower “public order” (defined as “maintenance of public order and prevention of public disorder”). This narrower term was sufficiently certain and constitutional, as it aligned with the core law-and-order purpose justifying state intervention.  

#### **e. Positive Duty of the State**  
The state has a **positive duty** to take reasonable measures to enable lawful assemblies (e.g., via notification to plan policing), but this duty is not absolute. The police must balance order with liberty, using proportional means (e.g., conditions rather than blanket prohibitions) where possible.  

#### **f. Dissent: Prior Restraint Is Unconstitutional**  
Justice Bokhary dissented, arguing the entire **prior restraint scheme** (Commissioner’s power to prohibit/object to processions) was unconstitutional. He contended the legitimate purposes (national security, public safety, etc.) were too broad and lacked critical constraints (e.g., a “clear and present danger” standard, requirement to exhaust less restrictive alternatives). Prior restraint on fundamental rights, he argued, demands stricter scrutiny, which the POO failed.  


### 4. Striking/Unusual Aspects  
- **Test Case for Civil Liberties**: The appellants deliberately engaged in an unauthorized procession to challenge the POO, making this a *strategic test case* to clarify Hong Kong’s constitutional protections for free assembly—unusual but common in advancing civil rights.  
- **Deep Judicial Split**: The majority (4 judges) and dissent (1 judge) revealed sharp divisions over the scope of state power to restrict free assembly. Bokhary’s dissent, citing global jurisprudence (e.g., U.S. *Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham*, German *Brokdorf Nuclear Case*), criticized the POO’s “standardless sweep” of discretion.  
- **Severance as a Pragmatic Remedy**: The majority’s use of severance to narrow “public order (ordre public)” to its law-and-order core was a pragmatic compromise, saving part of the statute while upholding constitutional rights—a rare but effective tool in Hong Kong’s post-1997 jurisprudence.  
- **Political Context**: The protest targeted a politically controversial conviction, highlighting the case’s role in balancing governance (police control) with Hong Kong’s tradition of political activism.  
- **Extensive International Citation**: Both sides and the Court heavily relied on international human rights cases (e.g., European Court of Human Rights, U.S. Supreme Court), reflecting Hong Kong’s integration of global standards into its constitutional law. [end of text]
