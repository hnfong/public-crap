Okay, I need to analyze this Hong Kong bill about protecting critical infrastructure computer systems. The user wants detailed answers to four specific questions, so I'll go through each part systematically.

First, for Question A about summary and purpose. The bill's full title is "Protection of Critical Infrastructures (Computer Systems) Bill" and its stated purpose is to protect computer security for critical infrastructure, regulate operators, and handle cyber threats. Major themes include regulatory oversight (with a Commissioner and designated authorities), mandatory security measures for operators, incident response protocols, and enforcement mechanisms. The structure shows it covers everything from defining critical sectors to imposing obligations and penalties.

For Question B on impact, the legislation primarily affects CI operators - organizations running essential services in sectors like energy, finance, and transport. These operators must comply with new cybersecurity requirements. Designated authorities like the Monetary Authority and Communications Authority also have new regulatory roles. Broader stakeholders include service providers, employees managing security units, and even organizations controlling relevant computer systems. Anyone involved with Hong Kong's critical infrastructure should be concerned about compliance burdens.

Question C requires identifying new obligations and rights. Obligations fall heavily on CI operators: maintaining local offices, setting up security units, submitting plans (security management, emergency response), conducting risk assessments/audits, reporting incidents, and participating in drills. The Commissioner gains significant powers - designating critical systems, issuing codes of practice, conducting investigations, entering premises with warrants, and granting exemptions. Authorities can demand information and give binding directions.

For Question D on liabilities, I'll systematically extract all offenses from the clauses. Criminal liabilities include fines up to HK$5M and daily penalties for continuing offenses. Key offenses cover: failing to comply with directions (Clause 7), information requests (Clause 18), office/notification requirements (Clauses 19-21), system change reporting (Clause 22), plan submission/implementation (Clauses 23,27), assessment/audit failures (Clauses 24-25), incident reporting (Clause 28), investigation non-compliance (Clauses 42,45), and secrecy breaches (Clause 58). Civil liabilities arise from non-compliance with obligations, though Clause 60 provides immunity for good-faith actions.

The bill establishes strict liability with limited defenses like "reasonable excuse" (Clause 66) and "due diligence" (Clause 65). It also has special evidence rules protecting against self-incrimination in certain proceedings.

Here's a detailed analysis of the Protection of Critical Infrastructures (Computer Systems) Bill based on your questions:

### **Question A: Summary, Purpose, and Major Themes**
- **Summary**: The bill establishes a regulatory framework to protect computer systems essential to Hong Kong's critical infrastructure. It designates critical sectors, creates oversight authorities (Commissioner and Designated Authorities), imposes cybersecurity obligations on operators, and grants investigation/enforcement powers to address threats and incidents.
- **Purpose**:  
  - Protect the security of critical infrastructure computer systems.  
  - Regulate operators of such infrastructure.  
  - Enable investigation and response to cyber threats/incidents.  
- **Major Themes**:  
  1. **Regulatory Oversight**: Establishes the Commissioner of Critical Infrastructure and sector-specific Designated Authorities (e.g., Monetary Authority for finance).  
  2. **Critical Designations**: Identifies critical infrastructures (e.g., energy, finance, transport) and designates their operators (CI Operators) and systems (Critical Computer Systems).  
  3. **Proactive Security**: Mandates risk assessments, audits, security plans, and incident response protocols.  
  4. **Incident Management**: Requires threat reporting, emergency drills, and grants powers for early intervention/investigations.  
  5. **Enforcement**: Imposes penalties for non-compliance and provides appeal mechanisms.

### **Question B: Impacted Parties and Stakeholders**
- **Impacted Parties**:  
  - **CI Operators**: Organizations operating critical infrastructure (e.g., banks, utilities, transport providers).  
  - **Service Providers**: Entities engaged by CI Operators for security management (Clause 21(2)(b)).  
  - **Organizations Controlling Systems**: Non-operator entities managing designated critical computer systems (Clause 37).  
  - **Government Entities**: Commissioner, Designated Authorities (e.g., Communications Authority), and public officers.  
- **Who Must Be Familiar**:  
  - CI Operators and their security teams.  
  - Designated Authorities (e.g., Monetary Authority).  
  - Legal/compliance teams in critical sectors.  
  - Cybersecurity auditors and consultants.  
- **Who Should Be Concerned**:  
  - CI Operators facing compliance costs/penalties.  
  - Organizations in Schedule 1 sectors (e.g., energy, healthcare).  
  - Entities sharing systems with critical infrastructure.  
  - Privacy advocates (due to data access powers).
