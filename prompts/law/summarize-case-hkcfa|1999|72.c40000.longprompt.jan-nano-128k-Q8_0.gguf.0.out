Okay, I need to tackle this case summary. Let me start by understanding the case details. The case is NG KA LING AND ANOTHER v. THE DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION [1999] HKCFA 72. The main issue here is about the status of certain Chinese nationals born on the Mainland as permanent residents of Hong Kong and their right of abode. The applicants are three individuals: two sisters, a man, and a woman born out of wedlock. The Director of Immigration denied their right of abode, leading to judicial review.

First, the facts: The applicants are Chinese nationals born on the Mainland. Their fathers were permanent residents in Hong Kong for at least seven years. They arrived in Hong Kong on 1 July 1997, which is the date Hong Kong was handed over to China. The Director didn't recognize their right of abode under Article 24(2) of the Basic Law, which has three categories. The third category is for those born outside Hong Kong of residents in categories 1 or 2. The Director's position is that they need a one-way permit from Mainland authorities, which they didn't have, so they don't have the right of abode. The applicants argue they should be recognized as permanent residents by descent.

Now, the arguments of the two parties. The applicants (Ng sisters, Mr Tsui, Miss Cheung) argue that they are permanent residents under the third category of Article 24(2) and thus have the right of abode under Article 24(3). They also challenge the Director's requirement for a one-way permit, which they say is unconstitutional. The Director, on the other hand, claims that the applicants must go through Mainland Exit-Entry Administration for approval, which they didn't do, hence they don't have the right of abode. The Director also argues that the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) was not legally constituted, so the No 3 Ordinance is invalid.

For the legal principles, the case is about the interpretation of the Basic Law, specifically Article 24. The Court had to determine if the Basic Law's provisions on permanent residents and their right of abode are subject to interpretation by the Hong Kong courts or require reference to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. The Court ruled that the Hong Kong courts can interpret the Basic Law on their own for non-excluded provisions, but if the interpretation affects excluded provisions (like Article 22(4) which deals with Mainland entry), they need to refer to the Standing Committee. However, the Court found that Article 24(3) is not qualified by Article 22(4), so the requirement for a one-way permit is unconstitutional. They also addressed the issue of the PLC's legitimacy, concluding that it was indeed a legally constituted body under the 1990 Decision, so the No 3 Ordinance is constitutional except for the parts related to the one-way permit and the retrospective provision.

The novel or controversial points here are the interpretation of the Basic Law's Article 24, especially the third category. The Court had to decide whether the Hong Kong courts can interpret the Basic Law without referring to the Standing Committee, which is a new issue. Also, the application of the ICCPR's Article 15(1) to the retrospective provision of the No 3 Ordinance, which the Court found unconstitutional. Another point is the legitimacy of the PLC, which the Court affirmed despite the initial concerns.

What's striking about the case is the detailed analysis of the Basic Law's interpretation and the constitutional implications of the Hong Kong courts' authority. The case is significant because it's one of the first to address the interpretation of the Basic Law by Hong Kong courts, establishing that they can interpret non-excluded provisions independently. The ruling on the PLC's legitimacy is also notable, as it clarified that the PLC was a transitional body, not the permanent legislature, but still valid under the Basic Law. The case also highlights the tension between the "one country, two systems" principle and the need for Mainland approval for entry, which the Court found not to apply to permanent residents. The decision to sever unconstitutional parts of the No 3 Ordinance shows the Court's role in checking the constitutionality of laws, which is a key aspect of the Basic Law's constitutional framework.

### 1. **Facts of the Case**  
The case involves three applicants—two sisters (Ng Ka Ling and Ng Tan Tan), a man (Mr. Tsui Kuen Nang), and a woman (Miss Cheung Lai Wah)—who are Chinese nationals born on the Mainland. All applicants claim to be permanent residents of Hong Kong under **Article 24(2)(3)** of the Basic Law, which defines permanent residents as those born outside Hong Kong of individuals who were permanent residents in Hong Kong for at least seven years or who are descendants of such residents. The applicants’ fathers were permanent residents under **Article 24(2)(2)** of the Basic Law, having resided in Hong Kong for over seven years. The applicants arrived in Hong Kong on **1 July 1997**, the day Hong Kong was handed over to China, and sought to assert their right of abode under the Basic Law. The Director of Immigration denied their claims, citing the **Immigration (Amendment) (No 3) Ordinance 1997**, which required applicants to hold a **one-way permit** issued by Mainland authorities (via the Mainland Exit-Entry Administration) to establish their status as permanent residents by descent. The applicants were detained, released on recognizance, or denied permission to land, leading to judicial review proceedings. The key legal disputes revolved around:  
- Whether the Hong Kong courts could interpret the Basic Law independently of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (a novel constitutional question).  
- Whether the **No 3 Ordinance** was constitutional, particularly its requirement for a one-way permit and its **retrospective** application.  
- Whether the **Provisional Legislative Council (PLC)** was a legally constituted body under the Basic Law.  
- Whether **Article 24(3)** of the Basic Law (granting the right of abode to permanent residents) was qualified by **Article 22(4)** (which requires Mainland approval for entry into Hong Kong).  
- Whether **Article 24(2)(3)** excluded children born out of wedlock, particularly Miss Cheung, whose father was a permanent resident but whose mother died shortly after her birth.  

The applicants argued that they were permanent residents by descent and thus entitled to the right of abode, while the Director contended that their status required Mainland approval and that the PLC lacked legal authority to enact the No 3 Ordinance.

### 2. **Arguments of the Two Parties**  
**Applicants (Ng sisters, Mr. Tsui, Miss Cheung):**  
- **Claimed permanent resident status under Article 24(2)(3)** of the Basic Law, arguing that their fathers were permanent residents under Article 24(2)(2) and that their birth outside Hong Kong (to such parents) qualifies them as permanent residents by descent.  
- **Challenged the requirement for a one-way permit** under the No 3 Ordinance, asserting that this requirement was unconstitutional because it effectively denied them the right of abode without their consent. They argued that the Basic Law’s right of abode (Article 24(3)) is unqualified and not subject to Mainland approval.  
- **Contended that the PLC was not legally constituted**, thus the No 3 Ordinance enacted by it was invalid. They also argued that the **retrospective provision** in the No 3 Ordinance (which applied to arrivals before 1 July 1997) violated the **ICCPR’s Article 15(1)**, which prohibits retrospective criminal liability.  
- **Argued that Miss Cheung’s birth out of wedlock should not exclude her from the third category** of permanent residents, as the Basic Law’s definition of "persons born of a parent who is a permanent resident" does not distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate children.  

**Director of Immigration (Respondent):**  
- **Maintained that the No 3 Ordinance was constitutional**, as it was enacted by the PLC, which the Director argued was a legally valid body under the Basic Law.  
- **Contended that Article 22(4)** of the Basic Law (requiring Mainland approval for entry into Hong Kong) qualified the right of abode under Article 24(3), meaning that permanent residents must obtain Mainland approval to enter Hong Kong.  
- **Argued that the one-way permit requirement was necessary** to ensure compliance with Mainland laws, which the Director claimed were binding on Hong Kong.  
- **Sought to refer the interpretation of Article 24(2)** to the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, asserting that the Hong Kong courts lacked jurisdiction to interpret provisions related to Mainland-China relations (e.g., Article 22(4)).  
- **Defended the retrospective provision** in the No 3 Ordinance, arguing that it was valid and that the applicants’ status as permanent residents by descent was not established until they applied for the one-way permit.

### 3. **Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**  
The case is a landmark decision in Hong Kong constitutional law, addressing the interpretation of the Basic Law and the limits of Hong Kong courts’ authority. The Court’s reasoning is multifaceted and includes several novel or controversial points:  

#### **A. Jurisdiction of Hong Kong Courts to Interpret the Basic Law**  
The Court held that **Hong Kong courts have the authority to interpret the Basic Law independently of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress** for provisions not classified as "excluded provisions" (those related to Mainland-China relations or Central Government responsibilities). This is based on **Article 158(2)** of the Basic Law, which authorizes Hong Kong courts to interpret "provisions within the limits of the Region’s autonomy." The Court clarified that the **"classification condition"** (whether a provision is excluded) must be determined by the Hong Kong courts, not the Standing Committee. This is a **novel interpretation** of the Basic Law’s constitutional framework, as it rejects the earlier view (from the Court of Appeal in *HKSAR v Ma Wai Kwan David*) that Hong Kong courts could not question the validity of National People’s Congress (NPC) acts. The Court emphasized that the **Basic Law is a national law** (Article 159) and that the NPC’s acts are subject to interpretation by the Hong Kong courts if they conflict with the Basic Law.  

#### **B. Constitutionality of the No 3 Ordinance**  
The Court ruled that the **No 3 Ordinance is constitutional except for specific provisions**. It held that:  
- **Article 24(3)** of the Basic Law **does not qualify** the right of abode for permanent residents by descent, as the Basic Law’s definition of "permanent resident" (Article 24(2)) does not require Mainland approval for entry.  
- **Article 22(4)** (requiring Mainland approval for entry) **does not apply to permanent residents** of Hong Kong, as they are not "people from other parts of China" but rather "permanent residents of the Region." The Court clarified that the **"one country, two systems" principle** ensures that Hong Kong’s residents are not subject to Mainland laws governing entry, even if they are born on the Mainland.  
- The **requirement for a one-way permit** (under the No 3 Ordinance) is **unconstitutional** because it effectively denies the right of abode to permanent residents by descent who arrived in Hong Kong before the Ordinance was enacted. This is because the Basic Law’s right of abode (Article 24(3)) is **unqualified** and not subject to Mainland approval. The Court also held that the **retrospective provision** in the No 3 Ordinance (which applied to arrivals before 1 July 1997) **violates the ICCPR’s Article 15(1)**, which prohibits retrospective criminal liability.  

#### **C. Legitimacy of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC)**  
The Court concluded that the **PLC was a legally constituted body** under the **1990 Decision** of the National People’s Congress. The PLC was established as a **transitional body** to ensure the smooth transfer of power after the handover, with its functions limited to preparing for the establishment of the first Legislative Council (which was to be formed by universal suffrage). The Court rejected the argument that the PLC lacked legal authority, emphasizing that its role was **explicitly authorized by the Basic Law** and that its actions were **consistent with the "one country, two systems" principle**.  

#### **D. Interpretation of Article 24(2)(3) and the Right of Abode**  
The Court applied a **purposive interpretation** of the Basic Law, emphasizing that the **right of abode** (Article 24(3)) is a **core constitutional right** for permanent residents. It held that the **third category** in Article 24(2) includes **children born out of wedlock** of permanent residents, as the Basic Law does not distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate children in this context. The Court rejected the Director’s argument that the **"birth out of wedlock" provision** in Schedule 1 of the Immigration Ordinance (para 1(2)(b)) was constitutional, stating that it **violates the principle of equality** enshrined in both the Basic Law and the ICCPR. The Court also clarified that the **"right of abode"** is not merely a right to enter but includes the **right to remain** in Hong Kong without restriction, which the No 3 Ordinance’s one-way permit requirement infringes upon.  

#### **E. Severance of Unconstitutional Provisions**  
The Court ruled that **unconstitutional parts of the No 3 Ordinance could be severed** from the rest of the Ordinance. Specifically:  
- The **requirement for a one-way permit** (Article 2AA(1)(a)) was excised, as it violated the right of abode.  
- The **retrospective provision** (Section 1(2)) was excised, as it violated the ICCPR’s Article 15(1).  
- The **"birth out of wedlock" exclusion** in Schedule 1 (para 1(2)(b)) was excised, as it was unconstitutional.  
- The **Director’s Notice** requiring applications to be submitted to the Mainland Exit-Entry Administration was also excised, as it was not necessary for the scheme as severed.  

#### **F. Application of the ICCPR to Hong Kong Law**  
The Court held that **Article 15(1)** of the ICCPR (prohibiting retrospective criminal liability) **applies to Hong Kong law** as it is incorporated into Hong Kong law via **Article 39** of the Basic Law. The Court found that the **retrospective provision** in the No 3 Ordinance **invalidates the one-way permit requirement** because it would retroactively criminalize the applicants’ entry into Hong Kong, which they had already done under the Basic Law. This is a **controversial application** of international human rights law to Hong Kong’s domestic law, as it requires the Hong Kong courts to interpret the Basic Law in light of the ICCPR’s principles.  

#### **G. Role of the Hong Kong Courts in Constitutional Review**  
The Court affirmed that **Hong Kong courts have the duty to interpret the Basic Law** and to invalidate laws inconsistent with it. This includes the **right of abode** (Article 24(3)) and the **provisions of the Basic Law** that define permanent residents. The Court emphasized that the **Basic Law is a national law** (Article 159) and that the Hong Kong courts are **constitutional checkers** of the NPC’s acts, provided they do not involve excluded provisions. This is a **novel interpretation** of the Basic Law’s constitutional role, as it expands the Hong Kong courts’ authority to interpret the Basic Law independently of the Standing Committee.

### 4. **Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case**  
This case is **extraordinary** in several ways:  
- **First of its kind**: It is one of the **first cases** to address the **constitutional jurisdiction of Hong Kong courts** in interpreting the Basic Law, particularly in relation to the Standing Committee of the NPC. The Court’s decision to **reject the Standing Committee’s authority** to override Hong Kong courts in this context is a **landmark ruling** on the autonomy of Hong Kong.  
- **Constitutional interpretation of the ICCPR**: The Court’s **application of the ICCPR’s Article 15(1)** to Hong Kong law is **unusual**, as it demonstrates how international human rights norms can be **integrated into Hong Kong’s constitutional framework**. This sets a precedent for the **enforceability of the ICCPR** in Hong Kong, even if the Basic Law does not explicitly mention it.  
- **Severance of unconstitutional provisions**: The Court’s **severance of the No 3 Ordinance** (excising the one-way permit requirement, the retrospective provision, and the "birth out of wedlock" exclusion) is a **novel approach** to constitutional law, allowing parts of a law to be **invalidated without invalidating the entire law**. This reflects the **"one country, two systems" principle** by ensuring that Hong Kong’s residents retain their constitutional rights even if certain provisions of the Basic Law are interpreted differently.  
- **Clarification of the PLC’s legitimacy**: The Court’s **affirmation of the PLC’s legal status** under the 1990 Decision is **remarkable**, as it resolves a **controversial issue** about the transition of Hong Kong’s legislature. The PLC was not the permanent legislature but a **transitional body**, yet the Court found it **legally valid** under the Basic Law.  
- **Rejection of the "one country, two systems" as a basis for Mainland approval**: The Court’s **clear rejection** of the argument that Mainland approval is required for Hong Kong residents (even if born on the Mainland) is **striking**, as it underscores the **autonomy of Hong Kong** in defining its own residency and right of abode. This decision **reinforces the principle** that Hong Kong’s residents are not subject to Mainland laws governing entry, even if they are born on the Mainland.  
- **Impact on the right of abode**: The Court’s **detailed analysis** of the right of abode as a **core constitutional right** (Article 24(3)) has **far-reaching implications** for Hong Kong’s legal system. It establishes that the right of abode is **not contingent on Mainland approval** and that the Basic Law’s provisions must be interpreted **generously** to protect residents’ fundamental rights.  

This case is **remarkable** for its **bold constitutional interpretation**, its **integration of international human rights law**, and its **clarification of Hong Kong’s autonomy** under the Basic Law. It is a **cornerstone of Hong Kong’s constitutional jurisprudence**, as it defines the limits of the Hong Kong courts’ authority and the **constitutional rights of permanent residents**.
