### 1. Brief Summary of Facts

The appellant, Chan Ming Lok, was convicted of possessing an offensive weapon (a knife) in a public place in contravention of section 33(1) of the Public Order Ordinance, Cap. 245. The incident occurred on 29 June 2008 at approximately 1:45 a.m. outside Nos. 9-11 Cochrane Street, Central, Hong Kong. Police officers observed the appellant acting suspiciously, walking slowly, looking around, and carrying a rucksack. He was stopped and questioned. The knife was found in his rucksack. The appellant claimed he used the knife as a cook in Shenzhen and carried it for self-defence against robbery when returning home late at night. He stated he was unaware it was illegal to carry in Hong Kong. The magistrate convicted him, finding the knife met the definition of an "offensive weapon" under section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance, and that the appellant had no lawful authority or reasonable excuse for possession. The appellant appealed, arguing the magistrate misapplied the law regarding the definition of "offensive weapon" and the concept of "reasonable excuse."

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**Appellant (Mr. Wong):**
- Argued the magistrate wrongly concluded the knife was an "offensive weapon" under section 2(c) of the Public Order Ordinance, which defines such weapons as articles "suitable for causing injury to the person."
- Relied on *R v. Chong Ah Choi & Others* [1994] 2 HKCLR 263, where Bokhary JA (obiter) suggested that the definition might need reinterpretation under the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (Cap. 383) to align with human rights principles.
- Contended that the magistrate's finding was based on an incorrect legal basis, specifically that the knife was "suitable for causing injury to the person" without sufficient evidence of intent to use it as such in Hong Kong.

**Respondent (Miss Lam for the Secretary of Justice):**
- Accepted that section 2(c) of the Public Order Ordinance might be unconstitutional under the Bill of Rights, effectively reducing the definition to three categories (a), (b), and (d).
- Argued the magistrate's findings were clear and sufficient, even if not perfectly articulated, and that the appellant's admission of carrying the knife for self-defence in China constituted an intent to use it as a weapon, satisfying the "intended for use" category (d).
- Contended that the appellant's claim of self-defence was not a reasonable excuse, especially given the lack of imminent danger in Hong Kong.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**Definition of "Offensive Weapon" under Section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance:**
- The court confirmed that section 2(c) of the Public Order Ordinance, which includes articles "suitable for causing injury to the person," remains part of the law unless amended. The court did not strike it down as unconstitutional, despite obiter comments in *Chong Ah Choi* suggesting potential incompatibility with the Bill of Rights.
- The court emphasized that the definition includes four categories: (a) made for causing injury, (b) adapted for causing injury, (c) suitable for causing injury, and (d) intended for use by the possessor to cause injury. The magistrate's failure to specify which category she relied on was a critical flaw.

**Magistrate's Findings and Appellate Review:**
- The court noted that the magistrate's written findings were unclear regarding the basis for concluding the knife was an offensive weapon. The court could not exclude the possibility that the magistrate relied on category (c) ("suitable for causing injury") rather than category (d) ("intended for use").
- The court applied a standard of review for a rehearing on the papers, deferring to the magistrate's factual findings (e.g., credibility of witnesses) but scrutinizing legal conclusions. The court found the magistrate's reasoning insufficiently explicit.

**Admissibility of Appellant's Admissions:**
- The court upheld the magistrate's acceptance of the appellant's admissions (e.g., carrying the knife for self-defence in China) as voluntary and truthful. The court reasoned that such admissions demonstrated an intent to use the knife as a weapon, satisfying category (d) of the definition.
- The court rejected the argument that the knife's use was limited to self-defence in China, stating that the potential for injury in Hong Kong was sufficient to establish the "intended for use" element.

**Reasonable Excuse and Lawful Authority:**
- The court affirmed that self-defence is not a reasonable excuse under section 33(1) unless there is imminent danger. The appellant's fear of robbery in China did not constitute a reasonable excuse for carrying the knife in Hong Kong.
- The court noted that the absence of imminent danger and the lack of connection between the appellant's movements and the knife were relevant to sentence but not to guilt.

**Sentence:**
- The court reduced the sentence from 6 to 4 months, acknowledging the appellant's lack of prior convictions and the relatively small size of the knife, but emphasizing the seriousness of carrying offensive weapons.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

- **Ambiguity in Legal Definition:** The case highlights the ongoing ambiguity and potential unconstitutionality of section 2(c) of the Public Order Ordinance, which criminalizes carrying items "suitable for causing injury." The court's reluctance to strike it down, despite obiter concerns, underscores the legislative lag in addressing human rights compatibility.
- **Magistrate's Vague Findings:** The magistrate's failure to clearly specify which category of "offensive weapon" she relied on is unusual for a seasoned magistrate, leading to a rehearing on appeal. This lack of clarity could undermine public confidence in judicial reasoning.
- **Admissions as Proof of Intent:** The court's acceptance of the appellant's admissions about his intent to use the knife for self-defence in China as proof of "intended for use" under category (d) is notable. It suggests that even self-defensive intent, if explicitly stated, can satisfy the legal definition, even if the threat was not imminent in Hong Kong.
- **Sentencing Discretion:** The court's reduction of the sentence from 6 to 4 months, while upholding conviction, reflects a nuanced approach to sentencing, balancing public safety with individual circumstances. The emphasis on the importance of deterrence ("one of the most important factors in rendering the streets of Hong Kong relatively safe") is a striking reminder of the law's prioritization of order over leniency in weapon possession cases.
