**Sec. 60001**
This section rescinds all unobligated balances of funds previously made available to carry out section 132 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7432), which authorized grants for clean heavy-duty vehicles.

**Sec. 60002**
This section repeals section 134 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7434), which established the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and rescinds all unobligated balances associated with it. The repeal removes the statutory authority for the Environmental Protection Agency to provide grants, loans, or loan guarantees to projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, no further funding can be allocated to the entities or projects that were intended to benefit from this specific climate finance mechanism.

No new appropriations are made for these HFC management efforts, and existing unspent funds are returned to the Treasury.

**Sec. 60009**
This provision rescinds all unobligated balances of amounts made available to carry out section 60110 of Public Law 117-169, which funded enforcement technology and public information programs. The action eliminates federal financial support for tools and initiatives designed to monitor air pollution compliance and educate the public on air quality standards. Consequently, the Environmental Protection Agency loses the funding necessary to maintain these specific enforcement and outreach capabilities under the cited statute.

**Sec. 60010**
This section rescinds all unobligated balances of amounts made available to carry out section 60111 of Public Law 117-169, which funded greenhouse gas corporate reporting requirements.

**Sec. 60025**
This section appropriates $256,657,000 for fiscal year 2025 to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for capital repairs, restoration, maintenance backlog, and security structures. These funds are to remain available until September 30, 2029, and no more than 3 percent of the total amount may be used for administrative costs. This appropriation is made out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, providing a specific, one-time infusion of capital for the Center's physical infrastructure.

**Sec. 60026**
This section amends the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to allow project sponsors to opt-in to pay fees for the preparation or supervision of environmental assessments and impact statements. If a sponsor chooses to pay, the fee is set at 125 percent of the anticipated costs to prepare or supervise the review, and the Council on Environmental Quality must provide a fee notice within 15 days of the sponsor's request. In exchange for payment, the environmental assessment must be completed within 180 days, and the environmental impact statement within one year of the notice of intent. This creates a new user-fee mechanism to potentially accelerate environmental review timelines for projects willing to bear the cost. [end of text]
