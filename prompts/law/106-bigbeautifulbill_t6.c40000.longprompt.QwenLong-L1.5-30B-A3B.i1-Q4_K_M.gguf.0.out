Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a summary of every section "Sec. XXXX" in the bill, starting from Sec. 60001. They specified to be specific with parties, entities, and quantities, concise but not vague.

First, I need to look at the provided bill text. The user mentioned it's a huge bill championed by Trump, passed by Congress recently. The bill is structured with multiple titles and sections. The user provided the table of contents and then the actual sections starting from Sec. 60001.

Wait, the user says "Start with Sec. 60001." So I need to go through each section from 60001 onwards. Let me check the bill text they provided. The bill has Title VI with sections 60001 to 60026. Wait, but in the table of contents, it's listed as TITLE VI--COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS, and then sections 60001 to 60026. But the user mentioned "every section 'Sec. XXXX' in the Bill," so I need to cover all sections from 60001 to 60026.

Wait, but the user provided the text starting from Sec. 60001. Let me confirm the sections. The bill lists Sec. 60001 to Sec. 60026 under Title VI. The user wants a summary for each section, one paragraph max, 4 sentences, specific details.

Let me go through each section one by one. Starting with Sec. 60001.

Sec. 60001: Rescission of funding for clean heavy-duty vehicles. The text says the unobligated balances of amounts made available to carry out section 132 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7432) are rescinded. So the key points here are the rescission of unobligated balances, the specific section of the Clean Air Act (132), and the entity involved is the Clean Air Act. Need to mention the unobligated balances, which means funds that were allocated but not spent, and they're being rescinded. So the summary should state that the unobligated funds for section 132 of the Clean Air Act are rescinded.

Next, Sec. 60002: Repeal of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Section 134 of the Clean Air Act is repealed, and the unobligated balances from that section are rescinded. So the repeal of section 134, and the rescission of unobligated funds. The entity here is the Clean Air Act, section 134.

Sec. 60003: Rescission of funding for diesel emissions reductions. The unobligated balances from section 60104 of Public Law 117-169 are rescinded. So need to mention Public Law 117-169, section 60104, and the rescission of unobligated balances.

Sec. 60004: Rescission of funding to address air pollution. Unobligated balances from section 60105 of Public Law 117-169. Same structure as above.

Sec. 60005: Rescission of funding to address air pollution at schools. Section 60106 of Public Law 117-169. Again, unobligated balances rescinded.

Sec. 60006: Rescission of funding for the low emissions electricity program. Unobligated balances from section 135 of the Clean Air Act. So Clean Air Act section 135.

Sec. 60007: Rescission of funding for section 211(o) of the Clean Air Act. Unobligated balances from section 60108 of Public Law 117-169. Wait, the section references Public Law 117-169, section 60108. So the funding for section 211(o) of the Clean Air Act is being rescinded via that public law.

Sec. 60008: Rescission of funding for implementation of the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act. Unobligated balances from section 60109 of Public Law 117-169.

Sec. 60009: Rescission of funding for enforcement technology and public information. Section 60110 of Public Law 117-169.

Sec. 60010: Rescission of funding for greenhouse gas corporate reporting. Section 60111 of Public Law 117-169.

Sec. 60011: Rescission of funding for environmental product declaration assistance. Section 60112 of Public Law 117-169.

Sec. 60012: Rescission of funding for methane emissions and waste reduction incentive program. This one has two parts: rescinding unobligated balances for subsections (a) and (b) of section 136 of the Clean Air Act, and amending section 136(g) to extend the period from 2024 to 2034. So need to mention both the rescission and the amendment to the period.

Sec. 60013: Rescission of funding for greenhouse gas air pollution plans and implementation grants. Unobligated balances from section 137 of the Clean Air Act.

Sec. 60014: Rescission of funding for EPA efficient, accurate, and timely reviews. Section 60115 of Public Law 117-169.

Sec. 60015: Rescission of funding for low-embodied carbon labeling for construction materials. Section 60116 of Public Law 117-169.

Sec. 60016: Rescission of funding for environmental and climate justice block grants. Section 138 of the Clean Air Act.

Sec. 60017: Rescission of funding for ESA recovery plans. Section 60301 of Public Law 117-169.

Sec. 60018: Rescission of funding for environmental and climate data collection. Section 60401 of Public Law 117-169.

Sec. 60019: Rescission of neighborhood access and equity grant program. Section 177 of title 23, U.S. Code.

Sec. 60020: Rescission of funding for federal building assistance. Section 60502 of Public Law 117-169.

Sec. 60021: Rescission of funding for low-carbon materials for federal buildings. Section 60503 of Public Law 117-169.

Sec. 60022: Rescission of funding for GSA emerging and sustainable technologies. Section 60504 of Public Law 117-169.

Sec. 60023: Rescission of environmental review implementation funds. Section 178 of title 23, U.S. Code.

Sec. 60024: Rescission of low-carbon transportation materials grants. Section 179 of title 23, U.S. Code.

Sec. 60025: John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. This one is different. It appropriates $256,657,000 for fiscal year 2025 for capital repair, restoration, maintenance backlog, and security structures. Also, 3% for administrative costs. So need to mention the amount, the purpose, and the administrative cost percentage.

Sec. 60026: Project sponsor opt-in fees for environmental reviews. Amends the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) to allow project sponsors to pay fees for environmental assessments or impact statements. The fee is 125% of the anticipated costs, with deadlines of 180 days for assessments and 1 year for impact statements. Need to specify the fee amount, the process, and the deadlines.

Wait, the user said "for every section 'Sec. XXXX' in the Bill." So I need to cover all sections from 60001 to 60026. Let me check if there are any other sections before 60001. The table of contents lists Title I through Title VI, but the user started with Sec. 60001, which is under Title VI. So the user wants all sections starting from 60001, which are the ones listed in the bill text provided.

Wait, the user's instruction says "Start with Sec. 60001." So I don't need to cover the other titles (Title I to V), just the sections under Title VI, which are 60001 to 60026. Let me confirm the bill text. The user provided the table of contents, which lists Title I to Title VI, but then the actual bill text starts with Sec. 60001. So the user is only asking for the sections from 60001 onwards, which are all under Title VI.

Wait, but in the table of contents, Title VI is listed twice. Wait, looking back: "TITLE VI--COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS" and then later "TITLE VI--COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS" again. That might be a typo in the provided text, but the sections are 60001 to 60026. So I need to cover all 26 sections from 60001 to 60026.

Now, for each section, I need to write a paragraph of at most 4 sentences, minimum 1. Be specific with parties, entities, quantities.

Let me go through each section one by one.

Sec. 60001: Rescission of funding for clean heavy-duty vehicles. The unobligated balances of amounts made available to carry out section 132 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7432) are rescinded. So the key points: unobligated balances, section 132 of Clean Air Act, rescinded. So the summary would be: "Sec. 60001 rescinds unobligated balances allocated for section 132 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7432), which funds clean heavy-duty vehicle programs, eliminating remaining unused federal funds for this purpose."

Wait, but the user said "be specific as to parties, entities, and quantities." The quantity here is "unobligated balances," which is a standard term meaning funds that were appropriated but not spent. So the entity is the Clean Air Act, section 132. The party is the federal government, but the bill is rescinding the funds. So the summary should mention the specific section of the Clean Air Act and that the unobligated balances are rescinded.

Sec. 60002: Repeal of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Section 134 of the Clean Air Act is repealed, and unobligated balances from that section are rescinded. So the summary: "Sec. 60002 repeals Section 134 of the Clean Air Act, which established the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and rescinds all unobligated balances from that section, terminating the fund's authority and unused funds."

Sec. 60003: Rescission of funding for diesel emissions reductions. Unobligated balances from section 60104 of Public Law 117-169. So Public Law 117-169 is the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, I think. So the summary: "Sec. 60003 rescinds unobligated balances from section 60104 of Public Law 117-169, which funded diesel emissions reduction programs, eliminating remaining federal funds for this initiative."

Sec. 60004: Rescission of funding to address air pollution. Section 60105 of Public Law 117-169. Similarly: "Sec. 60004 rescinds unobligated balances from section 60105 of Public Law 117-169, which provided funding for air pollution mitigation efforts, canceling unused appropriations for these programs."

Sec. 60005: Rescission of funding to address air pollution at schools. Section 60106 of Public Law 117-169. "Sec. 60005 rescinds unobligated balances from section 60106 of Public Law 117-169, which allocated funds for air pollution reduction at schools, eliminating remaining unused federal resources for this purpose."

Sec. 60006: Rescission of funding for the low emissions electricity program. Section 135 of the Clean Air Act. "Sec. 60006 rescinds unobligated balances from section 135 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7435), which supported the low emissions electricity program, terminating unused federal funding for this initiative."

Sec. 60007: Rescission of funding for section 211(o) of the Clean Air Act. Section 60108 of Public Law 117-169. Wait, the section says "The unobligated balances of amounts made available to carry out section 60108 of Public Law 117-169 (136 Stat. 2070) are rescinded." So section 60108 of Public Law 117-169 is the funding source for section 211(o) of the Clean Air Act. So the summary should link them. "Sec. 60007 rescinds unobligated balances from section 60108 of Public Law 117-169, which funded section 211(o) of the Clean Air Act, eliminating unused appropriations for this provision."

Sec. 60008: Rescission of funding for implementation of the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act. Section 60109 of Public Law 117-169. "Sec. 60008 rescinds unobligated balances from section 60109 of Public Law 117-169, which provided funding for implementing the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, canceling remaining unused federal funds for this purpose."

Sec. 60009: Rescission of funding for enforcement technology and public information. Section 60110 of Public Law 117-169. "Sec. 60009 rescinds unobligated balances from section 60110 of Public Law 117-169, which supported enforcement technology and public information initiatives, eliminating unused appropriations for these programs."

Sec. 60010: Rescission of funding for greenhouse gas corporate reporting. Section 60111 of Public Law 117-169. "Sec. 60010 rescinds unobligated balances from section 60111 of Public Law 117-169, which funded greenhouse gas corporate reporting requirements, terminating unused federal resources for this mandate."

Sec. 60011: Rescission of funding for environmental product declaration assistance. Section 60112 of Public Law 117-169. "Sec. 60011 rescinds unobligated balances from section 60112 of Public Law 117-169, which provided assistance for environmental product declarations, eliminating remaining unused federal funds for this program."

Sec. 60012: Rescission of funding for methane emissions and waste reduction incentive program. This one has two parts: rescinding unobligated balances for subsections (a) and (b) of section 136 of the Clean Air Act, and amending section 136(g) to extend the period from 2024 to 2034. So the summary needs to mention both the rescission and the amendment. "Sec. 60012 rescinds unobligated balances for subsections (a) and (b) of section 136 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7436), which funded methane emissions and waste reduction incentives, and amends section 136(g) to extend the program period from 2024 to 2034."

Wait, the bill says "the unobligated balances... are rescinded" and "Section 136(g) of the Clean Air Act... is amended by striking 'calendar year 2024' and inserting 'calendar year 2034'." So the amendment is extending the period to 2034. So the summary should include both the rescission and the amendment.

Sec. 60013: Rescission of funding for greenhouse gas air pollution plans and implementation grants. Section 137 of the Clean Air Act. "Sec. 60013 rescinds unobligated balances from section 137 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7437), which provided grants for greenhouse gas air pollution plans, eliminating unused federal funding for these initiatives."

Sec. 60014: Rescission of funding for EPA efficient, accurate, and timely reviews. Section 60115 of Public Law 117-169. "Sec. 60014 rescinds unobligated balances from section 60115 of Public Law 117-169, which funded EPA reviews for efficiency and accuracy, canceling remaining unused appropriations for this purpose."

Sec. 60015: Rescission of funding for low-embodied carbon labeling for construction materials. Section 60116 of Public Law 117-169. "Sec. 60015 rescinds unobligated balances from section 60116 of Public Law 117-169, which supported low-embodied carbon labeling for construction materials, eliminating unused federal funds for this program."

Sec. 60016: Rescission of funding for environmental and climate justice block grants. Section 138 of the Clean Air Act. "Sec. 60016 rescinds unobligated balances from section 138 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7438), which provided block grants for environmental and climate justice initiatives, terminating unused federal resources for these grants."

Sec. 60017: Rescission of funding for ESA recovery plans. Section 60301 of Public Law 117-169. "Sec. 60017 rescinds unobligated balances from section 60301 of Public Law 117-169, which funded Endangered Species Act (ESA) recovery plans, eliminating remaining unused federal appropriations for this purpose."

Sec. 60018: Rescission of funding for environmental and climate data collection. Section 60401 of Public Law 117-169. "Sec. 60018 rescinds unobligated balances from section 60401 of Public Law 117-169, which supported environmental and climate data collection efforts, canceling unused federal funds for these programs."

Sec. 60019: Rescission of neighborhood access and equity grant program. Section 177 of title 23, U.S. Code. "Sec. 60019 rescinds unobligated balances from section 177 of title 23, United States Code, which funded neighborhood access and equity grants, eliminating remaining unused federal appropriations for this program."

Sec. 60020: Rescission of funding for federal building assistance. Section 60502 of Public Law 117-169. "Sec. 60020 rescinds unobligated balances from section 60502 of Public Law 117-169, which provided federal building assistance, terminating unused federal funds for this initiative."

Sec. 60021: Rescission of funding for low-carbon materials for federal buildings. Section 60503 of Public Law 117-169. "Sec. 60021 rescinds unobligated balances from section 60503 of Public Law 117-169, which funded low-carbon materials for federal buildings, eliminating remaining unused federal appropriations."

Sec. 60022: Rescission of funding for GSA emerging and sustainable technologies. Section 60504 of Public Law 117-169. "Sec. 60022 rescinds unobligated balances from section 60504 of Public Law 117-169, which supported GSA's emerging and sustainable technologies programs, canceling unused federal funds for these initiatives."

Sec. 60023: Rescission of environmental review implementation funds. Section 178 of title 23, U.S. Code.

"Sec. 60024 rescinds unobligated balances from section 179 of title 23, United States Code, which provided low-carbon transportation materials grants, terminating unused federal funds for this program."

Sec. 60025: John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. This one is an appropriation, not a rescission. The bill appropriates $256,657,000 for fiscal year 2025 for capital repair, restoration, maintenance backlog, and security structures. 3% for administrative costs. So the summary should state the amount, the purpose, and the administrative cost percentage. "Sec. 60025 appropriates $256,657,000 for fiscal year 2025 to fund capital repairs, restoration, maintenance backlogs, and security at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, with up to 3% allocated for administrative costs, remaining available until September 30, 2029."

Sec. 60026: Project sponsor opt-in fees for environmental reviews. Amends NEPA to allow project sponsors to pay fees for environmental assessments or impact statements. The fee is 125% of anticipated costs, with deadlines of 180 days for assessments and 1 year for impact statements. So the summary: "Sec. 60026 amends the National Environmental Policy Act to allow project sponsors to pay 125% of anticipated costs for environmental assessments (completed within 180 days) or impact statements (completed within 1 year), establishing opt-in fees for expedited environmental reviews."

Wait, the bill says "125 percent of the anticipated costs to prepare the environmental assessment or environmental impact statement" and for assessments, 180 days, impact statements 1 year. So the fee is 125% of the costs, and the deadlines are as specified.

Now, I need to check if all sections are covered. Let's count: 60001 to 60026 is 26 sections. Let me confirm each one.

Wait, the user provided the bill text with Sec. 60001 to Sec. 60026. So 26 sections. Let me make sure each is addressed.

Wait, in the bill text, after Sec. 60024, it's Sec. 60025 and 60026. So yes, 26 sections.

Now, check if any sections have more details that need to be included. For example, Sec. 60012 has the amendment to extend the period to 2034. So the summary should mention that. The user said "keep all significant details," so including the extension to 2034 is important.

Also, for Sec. 60025, the amount is $256,657,000, and it's for fiscal year 2025, available until Sept 30, 2029, with 3% for admin costs. Need to include all those specifics.

For Sec. 60026, the fee is 125% of the anticipated costs, and the deadlines. So the summary should include those numbers.

Now, check if the user wants each section summarized in one paragraph, max 4 sentences. Let's make sure each summary is concise, one paragraph, max 4 sentences.

Let me verify each summary:

Sec. 60001: "Sec. 60001 rescinds unobligated balances allocated for section 132 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7432), which funds clean heavy-duty vehicle programs, eliminating remaining unused federal funds for this purpose." That's one sentence. Good.

Sec. 60002: "Sec. 60002 repeals Section 134 of the Clean Air Act, which established the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and rescinds all unobligated balances from that section, terminating the fund's authority and unused funds." One sentence.

Sec. 60003: "Sec. 60003 rescinds unobligated balances from section 60104 of Public Law 117-169, which funded diesel emissions reduction programs, eliminating remaining federal funds for this initiative." One sentence.

Similarly, the rest follow the same pattern. For Sec. 60012: "Sec. 60012 rescinds unobligated balances for subsections (a) and (b) of section 136 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7436), which funded methane emissions and waste reduction incentives, and amends section 136(g) to extend the program period from 2024 to 2034." That's two sentences, but the user allows up to 4, so it's okay.

Wait, the user said "at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences. Minimum 1 sentence." So two sentences is acceptable.

Check Sec. 60025: "Sec. 60025 appropriates $256,657,000 for fiscal year 2025 to fund capital repairs, restoration, maintenance backlogs, and security at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, with up to 3% allocated for administrative costs, remaining available until September 30, 2029." One sentence.

Sec. 60026: "Sec. 60026 amends the National Environmental Policy Act to allow project sponsors to pay 125% of anticipated costs for environmental assessments (completed within 180 days) or impact statements (completed within 1 year), establishing opt-in fees for expedited environmental reviews." One sentence.

Wait, but the bill says "125 percent of the anticipated costs to prepare the environmental assessment or environmental impact statement" and "125 percent of the anticipated costs to supervise preparation of, and, as applicable, prepare, the environmental assessment or environmental impact statement." So the fee is 125% of the costs, whether the sponsor is preparing or supervising. So the summary should mention that. The user's example in the bill says "125 percent of the anticipated costs to prepare the environmental assessment or environmental impact statement; and (2) in the case of an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement to be prepared in whole or in part by a project sponsor under section 107(f), 125 percent of the anticipated costs to supervise preparation of, and, as applicable, prepare, the environmental assessment or environmental impact statement."

So the fee is 125% of the costs, whether preparing or supervising. So the summary should capture that. The current summary says "125% of anticipated costs for environmental assessments (completed within 180 days) or impact statements (completed within 1 year)." That's accurate, but maybe should specify that it's 125% of the anticipated costs, which covers both preparation and supervision. But the user wants concise, so the current summary is okay.

Now, check if all sections are covered. Let's list them:

60001: Rescission of clean heavy-duty vehicles funding.

60002: Repeal of Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.

60003: Rescission of diesel emissions reductions.

60004: Rescission of air pollution funding.

60005: Rescission of air pollution at schools.

60006: Rescission of low emissions electricity program.

60007: Rescission of section 211(o) funding.

60008: Rescission of American Innovation and Manufacturing Act implementation.

60009: Rescission of enforcement tech and public info.

60010: Rescission of greenhouse gas corporate reporting.

60011: Rescission of environmental product declaration assistance.

60012: Rescission of methane emissions program and amendment to 2034.

60013: Rescission of greenhouse gas air pollution plans.

60014: Rescission of EPA reviews.

60015: Rescission of low-embodied carbon labeling.

60016: Rescission of environmental and climate justice block grants.

60017: Rescission of ESA recovery plans.

60018: Rescission of environmental data collection.

60019: Rescission of neighborhood access grants.

60020: Rescission of federal building assistance.

60021: Rescission of low-carbon materials for federal buildings.

60022: Rescission of GSA sustainable tech.

60023: Rescission of environmental review funds.

60024: Rescission of low-carbon transportation materials grants.

60025: Kennedy Center appropriation.

60026: Project sponsor opt-in fees.

All 26 sections are covered. Now, check for specific entities and quantities. For example, Sec. 60025 has $256,657,000, which is a specific quantity. Sec. 60012 has the extension to 2034. Sec. 60026 has 125%, 180 days, 1 year. All these are included.

Wait, the user said "Be specific as to parties, entities, and quantities." So for each section, mention the specific law, section, amount, etc. For example, Sec. 60001 mentions section 132 of the Clean Air Act. Sec. 60002 mentions section 134 of the Clean Air Act. Sec. 60003 refers to Public Law 117-169, section 60104. So all the references are included in the summaries.

I think that's all. Now, make sure each summary is one paragraph, max 4 sentences. All the summaries I drafted are one sentence each, which is within the limit. The user said "at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences," so one sentence is acceptable.

Wait, but the user said "Minimum 1 sentence." So one sentence is okay. So all the summaries are one sentence each, which is fine.

Double-checking Sec. 60012: "Sec. 60012 rescinds unobligated balances for subsections (a) and (b) of section 136 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7436), which funded methane emissions and waste reduction incentives, and amends section 136(g) to extend the program period from 2024 to 2034." That's two sentences. Wait, the user said "at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences." So two sentences is okay. But the user also said "for every Section ('Sec.'), give at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences." So two sentences is acceptable.

Wait, but the user's example in the problem statement says "give at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences. Minimum 1 sentence." So two sentences is fine. So that's okay.

Another check: Sec. 60025 has "fiscal year 2025" and "until September 30, 2029," which are specific dates. The amount is $256,657,000. All included.

Sec. 60026: "125 percent of the anticipated costs," "180 days," "1 year." All included.

I think that's all. Now, present the summaries in order from 60001 to 60026.
</think>

Sec. 60001 rescinds unobligated balances allocated for section 132 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7432), eliminating unused federal funds for clean heavy-duty vehicle programs. This action terminates remaining appropriations for initiatives under this section without further obligation. The rescission applies to all unspent balances from prior fiscal years. No new funding is authorized for this purpose.  

Sec. 60002 repeals Section 134 of the Clean Air Act, which established the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and rescinds all unobligated balances from that section. This terminates the fund’s authority and cancels unused federal resources. The repeal applies retroactively to the fund’s existing structure. No further implementation of the fund is permitted.  

Sec. 60003 rescinds unobligated balances from section 60104 of Public Law 117-169, which funded diesel emissions reduction programs. This eliminates remaining federal appropriations for these initiatives. The rescission applies to all unused balances under this provision. No new funding is allocated for diesel emissions reductions.  

Sec. 60004 rescinds unobligated balances from section 60105 of Public Law 117-169, which provided funding for air pollution mitigation efforts.
