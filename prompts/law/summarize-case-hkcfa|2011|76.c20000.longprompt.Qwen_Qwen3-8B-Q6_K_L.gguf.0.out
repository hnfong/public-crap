### 1. **Summary of the Facts**

This case involves a dispute over the validity of two wills left by Mrs. Nina Wang, who died in 2007. The first will, dated July 2002, was probated by the Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd (the Foundation), which was named as the sole beneficiary. The second will, dated October 2006, was claimed by the Applicant, Chan Chun Chuen, as the sole beneficiary. The Applicant contested the validity of the 2006 will, arguing that it was a forgery, while the Foundation sought to have the 2006 will declared invalid.

After a 40-day trial, Judge Lam found the 2006 will to be a forgery. The Applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal, which upheld the decision. The Applicant then sought leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) under two grounds: (1) as of right, based on the value of the claim, and (2) on a discretionary basis, arguing that the case involved a question of public importance. The CFA ultimately dismissed the application for leave to appeal, finding that the Applicant had not met the threshold for either ground.

### 2. **Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties**

**Applicant (Chan Chun Chuen):**  
The Applicant argued that he was entitled to leave to appeal as of right under section 22(1)(a) of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance. He claimed that the case involved a claim to property of significant value, specifically the entire estate of Mrs. Wang, which exceeded the $1 million threshold. He also argued that the case involved a question of public importance, as it concerned the interpretation of wills and the administration of estates, which are matters of general legal significance.

The Applicant further contended that the case involved an indirect claim to the property of the estate, as the outcome of the appeal would determine who would inherit the entire estate. He cited two previous Court of Appeal decisions, *Wang Din Shin v Nina Kung* and *Re Estate of Mui Yim Fong*, where similar claims were found to qualify for leave as of right.

**Foundation (Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd):**  
The Foundation opposed the Applicant’s application for leave to appeal. It argued that the Applicant’s claim did not meet the requirements for leave as of right, as the case did not involve a direct or indirect claim to a specific property or proprietary right. Instead, the Applicant was merely seeking a declaration of the validity of the 2006 will, which was not a claim to property but a legal procedural matter.

The Foundation also argued that the Applicant’s appeal was not of public importance and that the case did not involve any novel legal issues. Furthermore, the Foundation contended that the Applicant’s appeal would not result in a quantifiable financial impact, as the outcome of the appeal would require further adjudication to determine the distribution of the estate.

### 3. **Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) of the Case**

The case involved a detailed analysis of the legal principles governing appeals to the Court of Final Appeal, particularly under section 22(1) of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance. The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) held that the Applicant had not met the threshold for leave to appeal either as of right or on a discretionary basis. The key legal principles established in the case are as follows:

#### **(1) The "As of Right" Ground Under Section 22(1)(a)**

The CFA emphasized that the "as of right" ground applies only to claims that are **liquidated monetary claims** exceeding the $1 million threshold. The Applicant’s claim, however, was **unliquidated**, as it involved a dispute over the validity of a will rather than a specific monetary sum. The Court rejected the Applicant’s argument that the case involved an indirect claim to property, noting that the outcome of the appeal would require further adjudication to determine the distribution of the estate, which would not result in an immediate quantifiable financial impact.

The CFA also held that the two previous Court of Appeal decisions (*Wang Din Shin v Nina Kung* and *Re Estate of Mui Yim Fong*) were not binding, as they had been decided before the CFA’s interpretation of the "as of right" ground in *China Field Ltd v Appeal Tribunal (Buildings) (No 1)* and *WLK v TMC (No 1)*. These later cases established that the "as of right" ground must be interpreted narrowly, and that the claim must involve a **direct or indirect claim to a specific property or proprietary right** of the required value.

#### **(2) The "Discretionary" Ground Under Section 22(1)(b)**

The CFA considered whether the case involved a question of **public importance** or **exceptional circumstances** that warranted discretionary leave. The Applicant argued that the case involved a broader legal issue regarding the Court’s approach to concurrent findings of fact. However, the CFA rejected this argument, noting that the Court had a well-established practice of **not reviewing concurrent findings of fact** unless there was a **miscarriage of justice** or a **violation of a legal principle**.

The CFA also examined the Applicant’s argument that the Court of Appeal’s findings were inadequate and that the case involved new evidence that could undermine the trial judge’s findings. However, the CFA found that the new evidence did not amount to a **miscarriage of justice** and that the Applicant had not demonstrated that the findings of fact were **clearly erroneous** or that the Court’s practice was **unjust or outdated**.

#### **(3) The Immediacy Requirement**

A key legal principle established in the case was the **immediacy requirement** for claims to qualify for leave as of right. The CFA held that the Applicant’s claim did not meet this requirement, as the outcome of the appeal would require further adjudication to determine the distribution of the estate. The Court emphasized that the order sought by the Applicant would not have an **immediate financial impact** unless the Court could determine the exact value of the estate and the distribution of assets, which was not possible at the time of the appeal.

#### **(4) The Role of the Court of Final Appeal**

The CFA emphasized that its role is to **determine questions of law of general public importance**, not to engage in **factual review** of cases that have already been decided by lower courts. The Court noted that the practice of reviewing concurrent findings of fact is **exceptional** and should only be undertaken in cases where there is a **clear miscarriage of justice** or a **violation of a legal principle**.

The CFA also highlighted the **importance of judicial efficiency** and the need to **avoid unnecessary appeals** that do not contribute to the development of the law or the administration of justice. The Court stressed that the "as of right" ground should be used sparingly and only in **exceptional circumstances**, as it deprives the Court of its discretion to manage its docket.

### 4. **Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case**

This case is notable for several reasons, both legal and procedural:

- **The Extensive Legal Analysis**: The case involved an in-depth analysis of the legal principles governing appeals to the Court of Final Appeal, particularly the interpretation of section 22(1) of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance. The Court’s reasoning was thorough and detailed, reflecting the complexity of the legal issues at stake.

- **The Role of the "As of Right" Ground**: The case is significant because it clarified the narrow interpretation of the "as of right" ground, which is an unusual feature of Hong Kong’s legal system. The CFA emphasized that this ground should be used sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances, as it is not common in modern legal systems.

- **The Rejection of the "Public Importance" Ground**: The case also addressed the broader question of whether the Court should adopt a more liberal approach to appeals on the basis of public importance. The CFA rejected this argument, emphasizing the importance of judicial efficiency and the need to avoid unnecessary appeals.

- **The Use of New Evidence**: The case involved a detailed examination of the Applicant’s claim that new evidence, in the form of police statements, could undermine the trial judge’s findings. The CFA carefully analyzed the evidence and concluded that it did not amount to a miscarriage of justice, highlighting the importance of **judicial discretion** in evaluating new evidence on appeal.

- **The Cultural and Familial Context**: The case also touched on the **personal and familial relationships** between the parties, including the role of the attesting witnesses and the significance of the wills in the context of the deceased’s charitable activities and family dynamics. This added a human element to the legal dispute, making it more than just a technical legal question.

In summary, this case is remarkable for its detailed legal analysis, the clarification of the "as of right" ground, and the emphasis on judicial efficiency and the proper role of the Court of Final Appeal. It also highlights the importance of **judicial discretion** in managing the docket and ensuring that appeals are only granted when they contribute to the development of the law or the administration of justice.
