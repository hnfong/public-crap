Okay, let's tackle this case step by step. First, I need to summarize the facts. The case is HKSAR v. Chan Ming Lok from 2009. The defendant was convicted of possessing an offensive weapon, a knife, under the Public Order Ordinance. The facts involve the police observing him acting suspiciously at night in Hong Kong, following him, and then intercepting him. They found the knife in his rucksack. He claimed it was for self-defense because he was returning to Shenzhen late and feared robbery. The magistrate convicted him, but the appeal was about the legal definition of the weapon and the sentence.

Next, the arguments of both parties. The appellant's lawyer argued that the magistrate might have incorrectly used the "suitable for causing injury" part of the definition, which was questionable under the Bill of Rights. The prosecution agreed that part (c) might be invalid, so they had to rely on the other categories, especially the intent part. The defense also contested the sentence as too harsh.

For the legal principles, the key is the definition of offensive weapons. The court had to consider the four categories in the law, but due to the Bill of Rights, part (c) was problematic. The court here clarified that even if (c) is out, the defendant's admission of intent to use the knife for self-defense (which implies causing injury) falls under category (d). The court also addressed the sentence, reducing it from 6 to 4 months, considering his lack of prior convictions and the nature of the knife.

What's striking? The case highlights the tension between public safety and individual rights, especially regarding self-defense. Also, the court's note that the law hasn't been amended despite the 14-year-old ruling shows a legislative lag. The fact that intent to use for self-defense still makes it an offensive weapon under Hong Kong law is notable, even if there's no imminent threat. Plus, the substitution of sentence shows judicial discretion balancing punishment and circumstances.

### 1. Summary of Facts  
The appellant, Chan Ming Lok, was convicted of possessing an offensive weapon (a knife) under Section 33(1) of Hong Kong’s Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245) after being stopped by police in a public area late at night. Police observed him acting suspiciously, including repeatedly stopping, looking around, and adjusting his rucksack. During questioning, he admitted carrying the knife for self-defense due to fears of robbery while traveling late at night between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. The magistrate found the knife was an offensive weapon under Section 2 of the Ordinance and imposed a 6-month prison sentence. The appellant appealed both the conviction and sentence.

### 2. Summary of Arguments  
**Appellant’s Arguments:**  
- The magistrate may have incorrectly relied on the knife being “suitable for causing injury” (Section 2(c)), which was deemed problematic under Hong Kong’s Bill of Rights Ordinance (Cap. 383). This category was suggested as potentially invalid in *R v. Chong Ah Choi* (1994).  
- The appellant argued that his intent to use the knife for self-defense in Shenzhen (not Hong Kong) meant it did not qualify as an offensive weapon under the remaining categories (a, b, or d).  
- The 6-month sentence was excessive for a first-time offender carrying a small kitchen knife.  

**Respondent’s (HKSAR) Arguments:**  
- The prosecution conceded that Section 2(c) was invalid but argued the knife fell under Section 2(d): the appellant’s admitted intent to use it for self-defense (even in Shenzhen) demonstrated an intention to cause injury, satisfying the definition of an offensive weapon.  
- The appellant’s suspicious behavior and admission of intent negated any “reasonable excuse” for possession.  
- While not opposing a reduced sentence, the prosecution emphasized the importance of strict enforcement of weapon laws to maintain public safety.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  

#### **Definition of “Offensive Weapon” Under Section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance**  
The court reaffirmed the four statutory categories of offensive weapons but acknowledged the invalidity of Section 2(c) (“suitable for causing injury”) due to concerns under the Bill of Rights. This left three valid categories:  
1. **(a)** Made for injury.  
2. **(b)** Adapted for injury.  
3. **(d)** Intended by the possessor for use to cause injury.  

The court criticized the legislature for not amending the statute to remove the problematic category, calling it a “trap to the unwary.”  

#### **Application to the Case**  
The magistrate’s findings were unclear about which category the knife fell under. However, the court concluded that the appellant’s **admitted intent** to use the knife for self-defense (even in Shenzhen) satisfied Section 2(d). Key points:  
- **Intent as the critical factor**: The court held that self-defense inherently involves the *potential* to cause injury, even if not imminent. The appellant’s acknowledgment that he carried the knife to “protect himself” demonstrated the requisite intent under Section 2(d).  
- **Geographic limitation irrelevant**: The court rejected the argument that the knife’s intended use in Shenzhen (not Hong Kong) negated its classification as an offensive weapon in Hong Kong. The law prohibits possession in Hong Kong regardless of the intended location of use.  
- **No “reasonable excuse”**: The appellant’s claim of fearing robbery in Shenzhen did not constitute a “reasonable excuse” under Section 33(1). The court emphasized that self-defense cannot justify possession without evidence of imminent danger.  

#### **Sentencing Principles**  
The court reduced the sentence from 6 to 4 months, citing:  
- The appellant’s lack of prior convictions.  
- The knife’s small size and domestic use (not a weapon designed for combat).  
- The absence of evidence linking his suspicious movements to criminal intent (e.g., following others).  
However, the court stressed that Hong Kong’s strict stance against offensive weapons is vital for public safety, and even self-defense justifications do not mitigate the legal prohibition.

### 4. Striking or Unusual Aspects of the Case  
1. **Legislative Lag**: The court’s frustration with the 14-year delay in amending Section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance highlights a systemic issue in Hong Kong’s legal framework. The continued inclusion of an invalid statutory category creates ambiguity and risks unfair convictions.  

2. **Geographic Irrelevance of Intent**: The ruling that the knife’s intended use in Shenzhen still rendered it an offensive weapon in Hong Kong underscores the law’s strict territorial application. This could lead to unexpected outcomes, such as travelers being prosecuted for items meant for use abroad.  

3. **Self-Defense as a Factor**: The court’s dismissal of self-defense as a “reasonable excuse” without evidence of imminent danger contrasts with common law principles where self-defense is often a valid defense. This reflects Hong Kong’s prioritization of public safety over individual self-protection, even for non-violent possession.  

4. **Sentence Reduction Nuance**: The reduction from 6 to 4 months illustrates judicial discretion balancing deterrence with proportionality. The court’s acknowledgment of the knife’s domestic nature and the appellant’s lack of prior offenses adds a humanizing element to an otherwise rigid legal framework.  

5. **Behavioral Suspicion**: The detailed description of the appellant’s movements (e.g., repeatedly stopping, adjusting his rucksack) raises questions about racial or profile-based policing. While not addressed in the judgment, such details could fuel debates about police discretion and bias in high-crime areas.  

This case serves as a cautionary tale about the interplay between statutory interpretation, human rights, and public safety, while exposing gaps in legislative modernization. [end of text]
