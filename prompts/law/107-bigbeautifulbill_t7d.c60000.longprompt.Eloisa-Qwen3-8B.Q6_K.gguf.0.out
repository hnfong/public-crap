Okay, the user wants a summary of every section in this big bill, starting with Sec. 71101. The bill is pretty lengthy, so I need to go through each section carefully. The user specified that each summary should be at most one paragraph with up to four sentences, and they want specifics about parties, entities, and quantities. They also mentioned being concise but not vague, so I need to make sure I include all significant details without getting too wordy.

First, I'll start with Sec. 71101. It's about a moratorium on implementing certain Medicare Savings Program rules. The key points are the Secretary can't enforce the amendments until September 30, 2034, and there's funding for implementation. I need to mention the parties involved (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Secretary), the specific rules, and the funding amount.

Next, Sec. 71102 is similar but for Medicaid, CHIP, and Basic Health Program. Again, a moratorium until 2034, with specific sections being amended. I should note the entities affected and the funding.

Sec. 71103 deals with reducing duplicate Medicaid enrollments. It introduces new requirements for states to prevent multiple enrollments, including a system for address verification and funding. I need to highlight the state obligations, the new system, and the funding details.

Sec. 71104 is about ensuring deceased individuals aren't enrolled. It requires states to verify eligibility quarterly using the Death Master File and disenroll them if deceased. Funding is mentioned here too.

Sec. 71105 is about deceased providers not remaining enrolled. States must screen providers against the Death Master File quarterly starting in 2028.

Sec. 71106 is about payment reductions for erroneous Medicaid payments. It outlines how audits are conducted and the caps on erroneous payments.

Sec. 71107 is about eligibility redeterminations, requiring more frequent checks for certain individuals starting in 2027, with guidance and funding.

Sec. 71108 revises the home equity limit for Medicaid long-term care, allowing states to set higher limits up to $1 million.

Sec. 71109 restricts Medicaid eligibility to U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and specific aliens starting in 2026, with funding.

Sec. 71110 increases FMAP for emergency Medicaid for aliens, with funding.

Sec. 71111 is another moratorium on staffing standards for long-term care facilities until 2034.

Sec. 71112 reduces state Medicaid costs by adjusting eligibility redetermination periods and requiring cost-sharing for certain services.

Sec. 71113 prohibits federal payments to entities providing abortions, with specific definitions and funding.

Sec. 71114 sunsets an increased FMAP incentive for Medicaid, requiring states to spend down funds by 2026.

Sec. 71115 changes provider tax thresholds and introduces new rules for hold harmless provisions.

Sec. 71116 limits state-directed payments for Medicare services to 100% or 110% of Medicare rates, with grandfathering provisions.

Sec. 71117 adds requirements for Medicaid provider taxes to avoid being redistributive.

Sec. 71118 requires budget neutrality for Medicaid demonstration projects starting in 2027.

Sec. 71119 mandates community engagement for certain Medicaid recipients, with specific activities and exceptions.

Sec. 71120 modifies cost-sharing requirements for expansion Medicaid individuals, reducing costs starting in 2028.

Sec. 71121 expands HCBS coverage under Medicaid waivers, allowing standalone waivers for certain services.

Moving to Chapter 2, Medicare sections: Sec. 71201 limits Medicare coverage to U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and specific aliens, with a transition period.

Sec. 71202 provides a temporary payment increase for Medicare physicians for exceptional circumstances.

Sec. 71203 expands the exclusion for orphan drugs in the drug price negotiation program.

Chapter 3, Health Tax: Sec. 71301 restricts premium tax credits to certain individuals, including eligible aliens.

Sec. 71302 disallows premium tax credits during periods of Medicaid ineligibility due to alien status.

Sec. 71303 requires verification of eligibility for premium tax credits.

Sec. 71304 disallows premium tax credits for coverage enrolled during certain special enrollment periods.

Sec. 71305 eliminates the limitation on recapture of advance premium tax credits.

Chapter 4, Protecting Rural Hospitals: Sec. 71401 establishes a Rural Health Transformation Program with significant funding.

Subtitle C, Increase in Debt Limit: Sec. 72001 increases the public debt limit by $5 trillion.

Subtitle D, Unemployment: Sec. 73001 prohibits unemployment payments to jobless millionaires, with self-certification and verification requirements.

I need to ensure each summary is concise, includes the key parties (like CMS, states, Secretary), specific entities (like Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP), quantities (like funding amounts, dates), and the main changes. Avoid any markdown and keep the language clear and direct. Double-check that each section's summary adheres to the one-paragraph, up to four-sentence limit, and that all significant details are included without unnecessary fluff.
