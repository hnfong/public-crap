Okay, here's a breakdown of the bill, section by section, starting with Sec. 40001, adhering to your specified length and format requirements.

**Sec. 40001. Coast Guard Mission Readiness.**

This section provides a significant appropriation of $24.5935 billion to the Coast Guard for fiscal year 2025, with funds available until September 30, 2029. The funds are designated for procuring new assets, maintaining existing ones, improving shore infrastructure, and enhancing operational resilience, specifically targeting maritime border security, search and rescue, interdiction, and navigational safety. The allocation details specific funding amounts for various acquisitions, including aircraft, cutters (Offshore Patrol, Fast Response, Polar Security, Arctic Security, and Waterways Commerce), unmanned aircraft, and shore facility improvements. This aims to bolster the Coast Guard's capabilities across a range of critical missions.

**Sec. 40002. Spectrum Auctions.**

This section aims to accelerate the auctioning of spectrum frequencies, particularly in the 1.3 to 10.5 GHz band. It extends the general auction authority of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and mandates the auction of at least 300 MHz of spectrum, including 100 MHz between 3.98 and 4.2 GHz within two years.  It also directs the Assistant Secretary of Commerce to identify 500 MHz of frequencies for reallocation, prioritizing those suitable for full-power commercial licensed use cases, with a focus on maximizing revenue for the Treasury.

**Sec. 40003. Air Traffic Control Improvements.**

This section allocates $4.75 billion to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for improvements to air traffic control systems. The funding is earmarked for modernizing telecommunications infrastructure, replacing radar systems, enhancing runway safety, and upgrading other critical systems.  It also includes provisions for constructing a new Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) and consolidating existing TRACONs to improve efficiency and safety.

**Sec. 40004. Space Launch and Reentry Licensing and Permitting User Fees.**

This section establishes a user fee system for space launch and reentry licenses and permits issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The fees, increasing annually, will be deposited into a dedicated fund to support the FAA's Office of Commercial Space Transportation.  The law also mandates the transfer of a space vehicle to a field center for public exhibition.

**Sec. 40005. Mars Missions, Artemis Missions, and Moon to Mars Program.**

This section provides $9.995 billion to NASA for missions related to Mars exploration, the Artemis program (returning humans to the Moon), and the broader Moon to Mars program.  The funding is allocated to specific initiatives, including the procurement of a Mars telecommunications orbiter, supporting the Gateway lunar platform, advancing the Space Launch System, and improving infrastructure at NASA centers.  It also includes provisions for the transfer of a space vehicle for public display.

**Sec. 40006. Corporate Average Fuel Economy Civil Penalties.**

This section significantly reduces civil penalties for automakers who fail to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. It sets the penalty at $0.00 per vehicle, effectively eliminating financial repercussions for non-compliance, except for cases where the Secretary of Transportation hasn't provided a notification regarding the penalty. This change is intended to ease the financial burden on automakers.

**Sec. 40007. Payments for Lease of Metropolitan Washington Airports.**

This section modifies the annual payment required from the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) to the U.S. Treasury for leasing the airports. It extends the current payment amount until 2026 and mandates renegotiation of the payment level every 10 years to ensure it remains at least $15 million in 2027 dollars. This aims to provide more financial stability for the MWAA.

**Sec. 40008. Rescission of Certain Amounts for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.**

This section rescinds any unobligated balances of funds previously appropriated to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under specific sections of a prior law. This action effectively eliminates those unspent funds from future use.

**Sec. 40009. Reduction in Annual Transfers to Travel Promotion Fund.**

This section reduces the annual transfer of funds to the Travel Promotion Fund from $100 million to $20 million. This represents a decrease in funding for programs aimed at promoting tourism to the United States.

**Sec. 40010. Treatment of Unobligated Funds for Alternative Fuel and Low-Emission Aviation Technology.**

This section rescinds any unobligated funds previously allocated for alternative fuel and low-emission aviation technology. This action removes those funds from further allocation for these specific purposes.

**Sec. 40011. Rescission of Amounts Appropriated to Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund.**

This section rescinds $850 million from the Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund, established under the CHIPS Act of 2022. This represents a reduction in funding available for initiatives related to securing the public wireless supply chain. [end of text]
