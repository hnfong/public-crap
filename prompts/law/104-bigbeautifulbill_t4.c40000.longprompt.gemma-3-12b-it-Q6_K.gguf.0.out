The funds are exempt from certain spending limitations and procedures.

**SEC. 40002. SPECTRUM AUCTIONS.**

This section aims to accelerate spectrum auctions and reallocation to facilitate wireless broadband deployment. It extends the general auction authority of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to September 30, 2034, and mandates the FCC to auction at least 300 megahertz of spectrum, including 100 megahertz between 3.98 and 4.2 gigahertz within two years.  It also directs the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information to identify 500 megahertz of frequencies for reallocation, with a focus on maximizing revenue and supporting full-power commercial licensed use cases, and provides $50 million to the Department of Commerce for spectrum analysis.

**SEC. 40003. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL IMPROVEMENTS.**

This section allocates $4.75 billion to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for air traffic control improvements for fiscal year 2025, available until September 30, 2029. The funds are designated for telecommunications infrastructure, radar systems, runway safety technologies, Enterprise Information Display Systems, Automated Weather Observing Systems, a new Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC), TRACON recapitalization, unstaffed infrastructure sustainment, and other initiatives outlined in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2024.  The bill also mandates quarterly reporting on expenditures.

**SEC. 40004. SPACE LAUNCH AND REENTRY LICENSING AND PERMITTING USER FEES.**

This section establishes a user fee system for space launch and reentry licenses and permits issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The fees, deposited into a dedicated fund, will increase annually and are intended to cover the expenses of the Office of Commercial Space Transportation.  The law also mandates the Administrator to transfer a space vehicle to a field center for public exhibition and provides appropriations for Mars missions, Artemis missions, and the Moon to Mars program.

**SEC. 40005. MARS MISSIONS, ARTEMIS MISSIONS, AND MOON TO MARS PROGRAM.**

This section allocates $9.995 billion to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for fiscal year 2025, available until September 30, 2032, to support Mars missions, Artemis missions, and the Moon to Mars program. Specific allocations include funding for a Mars telecommunications orbiter, Gateway development, Space Launch System procurement, Orion spacecraft, International Space Station operations, infrastructure improvements at NASA centers, and a space vehicle transfer for public display.  The bill also establishes obligation deadlines for the allocated funds.

**SEC. 40006. CORPORATE AVERAGE FUEL ECONOMY CIVIL PENALTIES.**

This section significantly reduces civil penalties for automakers failing to meet Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards. It sets the penalty at $0.00 per vehicle for most model years and eliminates penalties for manufacturers who have not received a notification from the Secretary of Transportation regarding fuel economy violations. This effectively removes financial disincentives for lower fuel economy vehicles.

**SEC. 40007. PAYMENTS FOR LEASE OF METROPOLITAN WASHINGTON AIRPORTS.**

This section modifies the annual lease payments made by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) to the U.S. Treasury. It caps the payments at $3 million in 1987 dollars through 2026, then sets a minimum of $15 million in 2027 dollars for subsequent years, with renegotiation required every 10 years.

**SEC. 40008. RESCISSION OF CERTAIN AMOUNTS FOR THE NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION.**

This section rescinds any unobligated balances of funds previously appropriated to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under titles IV of Public Law 117-169. This effectively eliminates any unused funds from prior appropriations.

**SEC. 40009. REDUCTION IN ANNUAL TRANSFERS TO TRAVEL PROMOTION FUND.**

This section reduces the annual transfer of funds to the Travel Promotion Fund from $100 million to $20 million. This limits the amount of money available for promoting tourism in the United States.

**SEC. 40010. TREATMENT OF UNOBLIGATED FUNDS FOR ALTERNATIVE FUEL AND LOW-EMISSION AVIATION TECHNOLOGY.**

This section rescinds any unobligated balances of funds previously allocated for alternative fuel and low-emission aviation technology. This removes any remaining funds designated for these purposes.

**SEC. 40011. RESCISSION OF AMOUNTS APPROPRIATED TO PUBLIC WIRELESS SUPPLY CHAIN INNOVATION FUND.**

This section rescinds $850 million from unobligated balances previously appropriated to the Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund under the CHIPS Act of 2022. This reduces the funding available for initiatives related to securing the public wireless supply chain. [end of text]
