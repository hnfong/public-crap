### 1. Brief Summary of Facts

The case involves a dispute over the validity of a will. After the death of Mrs. Nina Wang in 2007, her foundation (the first respondent) initiated probate proceedings to validate her 2002 will, which named the foundation as the beneficiary. The applicant (Chan Chun Chuen) counterclaimed, propounding a 2006 will that would entitle him to the entire estate. The trial judge, Lam J, found the 2006 will to be a forgery and dismissed the applicant's claim. The Court of Appeal affirmed this decision. The applicant then sought leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal (CFA), arguing that the Court of Appeal's findings were erroneous and that the case raised issues of public importance.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**Applicant's Arguments:**
- The 2006 will was a genuine document, not a forgery. The applicant claimed that the trial judge and Court of Appeal erred in their factual findings regarding the authenticity of the will.
- The case involved a claim of significant value (over $1 million), entitling him to leave to appeal as of right under Section 22(1)(a) of the CFA Ordinance.
- The case raised issues of great general or public importance, justifying discretionary leave under Section 22(1)(b).
- The Court of Final Appeal should reconsider its practice of not reviewing concurrent findings of fact, as this practice was outdated and inconsistent with other Commonwealth jurisdictions.

**Foundation's Arguments:**
- The 2006 will was a forgery, and the trial judge's findings were supported by substantial evidence, including expert handwriting analysis and witness testimony.
- The applicant's claim did not meet the criteria for an "as of right" appeal under Section 22(1)(a) because it did not involve a claim to a specific property or proprietary right of the required value.
- The case did not raise a question of great general or public importance sufficient to warrant discretionary leave.
- The Court of Final Appeal should uphold its established practice of deferring to concurrent findings of fact by the trial judge and Court of Appeal, as this practice promotes judicial efficiency and finality.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**A. As of Right Appeal under Section 22(1)(a):**
The Court of Final Appeal clarified that the second limb of Section 22(1)(a) applies only to claims that involve a direct or indirect claim to a specific property or proprietary right of the requisite value. The Court rejected the applicant's argument that his claim for a declaration on the validity of the 2006 will constituted an indirect claim to the estate. The Court emphasized that the value of the claim must be clearly quantifiable and that the order sought must have an immediate financial impact. In this case, the applicant's claim was not a claim to property but rather a collateral challenge to the validity of a will, which did not meet the threshold for an as of right appeal.

**B. Discretionary Leave under Section 22(1)(b):**
The Court reiterated its established practice of deferring to concurrent findings of fact by the trial judge and Court of Appeal. The Court held that such deference is justified by the need to balance access to justice with judicial efficiency and the proper distribution of functions among court levels. The Court rejected the applicant's argument for a broader review of concurrent findings, noting that the practice is grounded in sound judicial policy and is consistent with the approach of other final appellate courts in the Commonwealth.

**C. Review of Concurrent Findings of Fact:**
The Court emphasized that it would only intervene in concurrent findings of fact in exceptional cases where there is a clear miscarriage of justice or a violation of legal principles. The Court found no such grounds in the present case, as the Court of Appeal's findings were based on a thorough evaluation of the evidence, including expert testimony and scientific analysis. The Court also rejected the applicant's attempt to introduce fresh evidence, concluding that it did not undermine the credibility of key witnesses or constitute a basis for overturning the findings.

**D. Public Interest and Finality:**
The Court stressed the importance of judicial finality and the need to avoid prolonged litigation. The Court noted that the public interest is served by limiting appeals to cases that raise arguable points of law of general public importance. The Court expressed concern that allowing appeals on factual findings would lead to a "process of attrition" and undermine the efficiency of the justice system.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

- **High-Profile Case:** The case involved the estate of Nina Wang, one of Hong Kong's wealthiest individuals, adding significant public and media interest.
- **Forgery Allegations:** The central issue was whether a will was a forgery, a matter that required intricate analysis of handwriting, witness testimony, and circumstantial evidence.
- **Judicial Deference to Findings:** The case highlighted the Court of Final Appeal's reluctance to overturn concurrent findings of fact, reflecting a broader judicial philosophy that prioritizes finality and efficiency over re-litigation of facts.
- **Public Interest in Probate Law:** The case underscored the importance of probate law in high-stakes disputes over substantial estates, particularly in cases involving allegations of forgery or undue influence.
- **Policy Implications:** The judgment touched on broader policy considerations, such as the balance between access to justice and judicial efficiency, and the role of final appellate courts in reviewing factual findings.
