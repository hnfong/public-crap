## NG KA LING AND ANOTHER v. THE DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION – Case Summary

### 1. Facts of the Case

This case concerns the right of abode in Hong Kong for individuals born on the mainland to Hong Kong permanent residents, specifically those falling under the third category of Article 24(2) of the Basic Law. Following the 1997 handover, a large number of mainland residents with Hong Kong parentage sought to exercise their right of abode. The Director of Immigration implemented a scheme, through the Immigration (Amendment) (No. 3) Ordinance 1997 (“No. 3 Ordinance”), requiring these individuals to obtain a travel document with a certificate of entitlement from the mainland authorities before being recognized as permanent residents with the right of abode.  Four applicants – Ng Ka Ling, Ng Tan Tan, Tsui Kuen Nang, and Cheung Lai Wah – challenged this scheme, arguing it was unconstitutional. Cheung Lai Wah also argued that her status as a child born out of wedlock should not disqualify her from permanent residency. The case progressed through the lower courts, ultimately reaching the Court of Final Appeal.  The core issue revolved around the interpretation of the Basic Law, particularly Articles 22(4) and 24, and the validity of the No. 3 Ordinance in light of these provisions.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**The Applicants (Ng Ka Ling, Ng Tan Tan, Tsui Kuen Nang, Cheung Lai Wah):**

*   Argued that as permanent residents under Article 24(2), they were inherently entitled to the right of abode in Hong Kong.
*   Contended that the No. 3 Ordinance, requiring mainland approval via a one-way permit, effectively subjected their constitutional right to the discretion of mainland authorities, violating Hong Kong’s autonomy.
*   Asserted that Article 22(4) of the Basic Law, concerning entry requirements for mainland residents, did not apply to individuals *already* possessing the status of permanent residents.
*   Cheung Lai Wah specifically argued that the Immigration Ordinance’s distinction between children born in and out of wedlock was discriminatory and unconstitutional.
*   Challenged the retrospective application of the No. 3 Ordinance, arguing it created criminal offenses retrospectively.
*   Argued that the Provisional Legislative Council lacked the legitimacy to enact the No. 3 Ordinance.

**The Director of Immigration:**

*   Maintained that the No. 3 Ordinance was constitutional, justified by Article 22(4) of the Basic Law, which allows the central government to control entry from the mainland.
*   Argued that the scheme was a reasonable measure to regulate the influx of mainland residents and ensure orderly immigration.
*   Contended that the requirement for mainland approval did not infringe upon the right of abode but merely established a process for exercising that right.
*   Initially argued that Cheung Lai Wah was not a permanent resident due to being born out of wedlock, but later conceded this point.
*   Defended the retrospective application of the No. 3 Ordinance as necessary for implementing the immigration regime.
*   Argued that the Provisional Legislative Council was legally constituted and had the authority to enact legislation.



### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

This case establishes several crucial legal principles concerning the interpretation of the Basic Law, the scope of Hong Kong’s autonomy, and the rights of permanent residents.

**1. Constitutional Jurisdiction of Hong Kong Courts:** The Court unequivocally affirmed that Hong Kong courts possess the jurisdiction to interpret the Basic Law and to examine the constitutionality of both Hong Kong legislation and acts of the National People’s Congress (NPC) and its Standing Committee. This jurisdiction is fundamental to the courts’ role as a constitutional check on the executive and legislative branches, safeguarding the Basic Law’s provisions.  The court rejected the prior holding in *HKSAR v Ma Wai Kwan David* which had limited this jurisdiction.

**2. Approach to Basic Law Interpretation:** The Court outlined a purposive approach to interpreting the Basic Law, emphasizing the importance of considering the document’s overall purpose – establishing Hong Kong as a region with a high degree of autonomy under the “one country, two systems” principle.  This requires examining the text in context, considering relevant extrinsic materials like the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and adopting a generous interpretation of provisions guaranteeing fundamental rights.

**3. Relationship Between Article 24 and Article 22(4):**  A central holding of the case is the rejection of the Director’s argument that Article 22(4) qualifies the right of abode conferred by Article 24. The Court held that Article 22(4), concerning entry requirements for those *from* mainland China, does not apply to individuals who *are* permanent residents of Hong Kong.  Permanent residents are not “people from other parts of China” in the context of Article 22(4); they *are* residents of Hong Kong with a constitutionally guaranteed right of abode.  This is a critical clarification, protecting the autonomy of Hong Kong’s immigration regime for those already recognized as permanent residents.

**4. Unconstitutionality of the No. 3 Ordinance (Partially):** The Court found that the portion of the No. 3 Ordinance requiring permanent residents by descent to obtain a one-way permit from mainland authorities before exercising their right of abode was unconstitutional. This requirement was deemed to unduly subject the exercise of a constitutional right to the discretion of mainland authorities, infringing upon Hong Kong’s autonomy. However, the Court severed this unconstitutional portion, upholding the remainder of the scheme relating to verification of residency claims.

**5. Severance of Unconstitutional Provisions:** The Court affirmed the principle of severance, allowing the unconstitutional parts of the No. 3 Ordinance to be excised while preserving the valid portions. This ensured that the scheme for verifying residency claims could continue to operate without violating the Basic Law.

**6. Retrospectivity and Criminal Liability:** The Court held that the retrospective application of the No. 3 Ordinance was unconstitutional. Applying the principle enshrined in Article 15(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the Court found that the ordinance could not retrospectively criminalize conduct that was lawful before its enactment.

**7.  Discrimination Based on Birth Status:** The Court upheld the lower court’s ruling that the distinction in the Immigration Ordinance between children born in and out of wedlock was discriminatory and unconstitutional. The ordinance was amended to treat children born in and out of wedlock equally for the purposes of establishing permanent residency through a parent.

**8. Legitimacy of the Provisional Legislative Council:** The Court affirmed the legitimacy of the Provisional Legislative Council, finding that its establishment was consistent with the Basic Law and the 1990 Decision of the National People’s Congress.



**Novel and Controversial Points:**

*   **The Scope of Hong Kong’s Autonomy:** The case represents a strong assertion of Hong Kong’s constitutional jurisdiction and its ability to interpret the Basic Law independently, even when it potentially conflicts with the interests of the central government. This is a particularly sensitive issue given the evolving political relationship between Hong Kong and mainland China.
*   **Interpretation of “One Country, Two Systems”:** The Court’s interpretation of Article 24 and its rejection of the Director’s reliance on Article 22(4) underscore the importance of maintaining a distinct legal and immigration regime in Hong Kong, consistent with the “two systems” aspect of the “one country, two systems” principle.
*   **The Role of International Human Rights Law:** The Court’s reliance on Article 15(1) of the ICCPR to invalidate the retrospective application of the No. 3 Ordinance highlights the importance of international human rights law in interpreting and applying the Basic Law.
*   **The Balancing of Interests:** The case demonstrates the Court’s attempt to balance the interests of the central government in regulating immigration with the constitutional rights of Hong Kong residents, particularly those with strong ties to the region.



This case is a landmark decision in Hong Kong constitutional law, providing crucial guidance on the interpretation of the Basic Law and the protection of fundamental rights in the post-handover era. It remains highly relevant in the ongoing debate over Hong Kong’s autonomy and its relationship with mainland China. [end of text]
