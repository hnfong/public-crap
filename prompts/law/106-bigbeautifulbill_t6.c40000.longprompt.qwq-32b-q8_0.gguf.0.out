Okay, let me tackle this query. The user wants a summary of each section in the provided bill, starting with Sec. 60001. They specified that each section should be a paragraph of up to four sentences, with specifics on parties, entities, and quantities. 

First, I need to parse the bill text provided. The user included sections from Title VI of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. Each section starts with "SEC." followed by a number. The user wants summaries for each of these sections, starting from 60001 up to 60026.

Looking at the first section, Sec. 60001: It mentions rescinding unobligated balances for clean heavy-duty vehicles under section 132 of the Clean Air Act. The key points here are the action (rescission), the specific fund (section 132 funds), and the effect (funds are canceled). 

Next, Sec. 60002 repeals section 134 of the Clean Air Act and rescinds its funds. I need to note both the repeal and the fund cancellation. 

Continuing through each section, I see a pattern of rescissions. For example, Sec. 60003 rescinds diesel emissions funds from Public Law 117-169. Each of these sections is about cutting existing funds. 

Sections like 60012 have two parts: rescinding funds and amending a date. I need to mention both actions concisely. 

Sec. 60025 is an appropriation for the Kennedy Center, so the summary should include the amount and purpose. 

Sec. 60026 adds a new fee structure under NEPA, so I need to explain the fee process and deadlines. 

I must ensure each summary is specific, mentioning the exact sections or laws affected, the entities involved (like EPA, project sponsors), and any numerical details (like the $256 million in Sec. 60025). 

I should avoid vague terms. For instance, instead of saying "some funds are cut," specify which funds and under which law. Also, check that each section is addressed individually, even if they follow a similar pattern. 

Wait, the user mentioned starting with Sec. 60001, but in the provided text, there are sections up to 60026. I need to make sure I cover all sections listed under Title VI. Let me count them: from 60001 to 60026, that's 26 sections. Each needs a separate summary. 

I should also check for any sections that might have subparts, like Sec. 60012 has (a) and (b). Need to include both parts in the summary without exceeding four sentences. 

Finally, ensure clarity and conciseness, sticking to the user's structure and requirements. Avoid any markdown and keep each section's summary as a separate paragraph.
