Got it, let's tackle this. The user wants summaries for every section starting with Sec. 60001 from the provided bill text. First, I need to go through each Sec. 60001 to 60026 and extract the key points: what's being done (rescind, repeal, appropriate, amend), which entities are affected, any specific laws or programs, and quantities if applicable.

Starting with Sec. 60001: It's about rescinding unobligated balances for clean heavy-duty vehicles under section 132 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7432). So I need to mention the rescission of unobligated balances, the specific CAA section, and the purpose (clean heavy-duty vehicles).

Key points: appropriation amount, FY, purpose, availability period, admin cost limit.

Sec. 60026: Amends NEPA (42 U.S.C. 4331 et seq.) by adding Sec. 112, which creates a project sponsor opt-in fee process: project sponsors submit project info/declaration to CEQ, CEQ provides fee notice (125% of anticipated preparation/supervision costs) within 15 days; fee payment allows shorter deadlines (180 days for EA, 1 year for EIS post-NOI) instead of standard NEPA timelines. Need to include the amendment to NEPA, the fee process (submission, CEQ notice, fee amount), and the deadline changes.

Now, I need to make sure each is concise (1-4 sentences), specific (mentions laws, PLs, entities, quantities), and covers all significant details. Avoid vagueness. Check that for rescissions, I mention "unobligated balances" as that's key. For Sec. 60025, the amount, purpose, time period, and admin cost. For Sec. 60026, the NEPA amendment, the fee process steps, fee amount (125% of anticipated costs), and deadline modifications.</seed:think>Sec. 60001: Rescinds unobligated balances of funds available under section 132 of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7432) for clean heavy-duty vehicle programs.
