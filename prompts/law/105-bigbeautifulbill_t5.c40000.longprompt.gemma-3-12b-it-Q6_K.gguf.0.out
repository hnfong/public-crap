Okay, here's a breakdown of the bill, section by section, as requested.

**Sec. 50101. Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing.**

This section significantly alters the provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 regarding onshore oil and gas leasing. It repeals sections of that act that modified royalty rates and eliminated non-competitive leasing practices. The bill mandates the immediate resumption of quarterly onshore oil and gas lease sales, requiring timely environmental reviews and prioritizing sales on lands nominated for leasing.

**Sec. 50102. Offshore Oil and Gas Leasing.**

This section aims to increase offshore oil and gas lease sales. It mandates a minimum of 30 region-wide sales in the Gulf of Mexico and 6 in Alaska over the next several years, overriding aspects of the existing offshore leasing program. It also establishes specific royalty rates and revenue sharing arrangements for Alaska, and streamlines the process for commingling production from multiple sources.

**Sec. 50103. Royalties on Extracted Methane.**

This section simply repeals a provision from the Inflation Reduction Act related to methane royalty rates. It effectively removes any changes made by that earlier legislation concerning royalties on extracted methane.

**Sec. 50104. Alaska Oil and Gas Leasing.**

This section focuses on boosting oil and gas leasing in Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A). It requires the Secretary of the Interior to resume lease sales in the NPR-A, mandating a minimum of 5 sales within 10 years and offering a significant acreage amount. It also directs a portion of revenue from these leases to the State of Alaska.

**Sec. 50105. National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.**

This section builds upon Sec. 50104, further solidifying the requirements for oil and gas leasing in the NPR-A. It reinforces the schedule for lease sales, specifies acreage requirements, and outlines how revenue generated from these leases will be distributed between the State of Alaska and the federal government.

**Sec. 50203. Leases for Known Recoverable Coal Resources.**

This section mandates the Secretary of the Interior to make available for lease a minimum of 4 million acres of Federal land for coal resources. It specifies that these lands must be located in the 48 contiguous states and Alaska, excluding certain protected areas like National Monuments.

**Sec. 50204. Authorization to Mine Federal Coal.**

This section authorizes the mining of Federal coal reserves adjacent to State or private land, even if it requires mining Federal land. It aims to facilitate access to coal reserves that might otherwise be economically unviable to extract.

**Sec. 50302. Renewable Energy Fees on Federal Land.**

This section establishes a fee structure for renewable energy projects on Federal land, including acreage rents and capacity fees. It aims to increase revenue generation from renewable energy development while providing incentives for multiple land uses and potentially reducing fees for wind energy projects.

**Sec. 50303. Renewable Energy Revenue Sharing.**

This section outlines how revenue generated from renewable energy projects on Federal land will be shared. It mandates that 25% of the revenue be paid to the state and 25% to the county where the project is located, with the remainder going to the federal government.

**Sec. 50304. Rescission of National Park Service and Bureau of Land Management Funds.**

This section repeals and rescinds funding from several provisions within the Inflation Reduction Act. It targets specific programs and initiatives related to energy and climate, effectively eliminating funding for those areas.

**Sec. 50403. Energy Dominance Financing.**

This section amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to broaden the scope of energy projects eligible for financing. It expands the definition of activities that qualify for support, including those related to grid reliability and new energy technologies. It also provides $1 billion in funding for these activities.

**Sec. 50404. Transformational Artificial Intelligence Models.**

This section directs the Secretary of Energy to support the development of artificial intelligence models for scientific and engineering applications. It emphasizes the use of curated data from National Laboratories and aims to accelerate innovation in areas like microelectronics and new energy technologies, allocating $150 million for this purpose.

**Sec. 50501. Water Conveyance and Surface Water Storage Enhancement.**

This section appropriates $1 billion to the Secretary of the Interior for projects that restore or increase the capacity of existing water conveyance and storage facilities. It aims to improve water infrastructure and enhance water availability, with funds available through fiscal year 2034.
