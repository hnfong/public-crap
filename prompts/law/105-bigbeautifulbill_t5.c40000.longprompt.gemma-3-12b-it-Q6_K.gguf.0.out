Okay, here's a breakdown of the bill, section by section, as requested.

**Sec. 50101. Onshore Oil and Gas Leasing.**

This section repeals provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 related to onshore oil and gas royalty rates and noncompetitive leasing. It mandates the Secretary of the Interior immediately resume quarterly onshore oil and gas lease sales, ensuring compliance with the Mineral Leasing Act and the National Environmental Policy Act. The definition of "eligible lands" is amended to broaden the availability of land for leasing, and requires a minimum of four oil and gas lease sales per year in specific states (Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Nevada, and Alaska), offering at least 50% of nominated parcels. Finally, it amends the Mineral Leasing Act to streamline leasing processes and allow for commingling of production.

**Sec. 50102. Offshore Oil and Gas Leasing.**

This section mandates a minimum of 30 region-wide offshore oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and 6 in Alaska's Cook Inlet, overriding aspects of the existing National Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program. It sets a schedule for these sales, requiring at least one in the Gulf of Mexico by December 15, 2025, and regular sales through 2040, and one in Alaska each year from 2026-2028 and 2030-2032.  The section also establishes royalty rates, stipulates terms and conditions for lease sales, and mandates that 70% of revenues from Alaska sales after 2033 be paid to the State of Alaska.

**Sec. 50103. Royalties on Extracted Methane.**

This section simply repeals Section 50263 of Public Law 117-169, which related to methane royalty rates. This effectively removes the changes made by the Inflation Reduction Act regarding methane royalties.

**Sec. 50104. Alaska Oil and Gas Leasing.**

This section aims to expedite oil and gas leasing in Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska (NPR-A). It requires the Secretary of the Interior to resume leasing activities and conduct at least five lease sales within ten years, offering a minimum of 4 million acres per sale.  It mandates specific timelines for these sales and stipulates that 50% of revenues from these leases between 2025 and 2033, and 70% after 2033, will be paid to the State of Alaska.

**Sec. 50105. National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.**

This section reinforces the provisions of Sec. 50104, further directing the Secretary of the Interior to expedite oil and gas leasing in the NPR-A. It defines key terms related to the leasing program and mandates the resumption of lease sales, ensuring a minimum of 4 million acres are offered in each sale. It also outlines the revenue sharing agreement with the State of Alaska, mirroring the percentages detailed in Sec. 50104.

**Sec. 50201. Coal Leasing.**

This section aims to accelerate coal leasing on Federal lands. It directs the Secretary of the Interior to process pending coal lease applications within 90 days, conducting fair market value assessments and holding lease sales. It prioritizes applications that have already undergone environmental review and allows for the resumption of mining activities on previously approved plans.

**Sec. 50202. Coal Royalty.**

This section modifies the coal royalty rate. It lowers the royalty rate to a maximum of 12.5% through September 30, 2034, and provides a credit to lessees for any overpayment of royalties prior to the Act's enactment. This change is applicable to both existing and future coal leases.

**Sec. 50203. Leases for Known Recoverable Coal Resources.**

This section mandates the Secretary of the Interior to make available at least 4 million acres of Federal land for coal leasing, excluding certain protected areas. This provision overrides existing land use plans and aims to increase coal production.

**Sec. 50204. Authorization to Mine Federal Coal.**

This section authorizes the mining of Federal coal reserves adjacent to State or private land, even if it requires modifying previously approved mining plans. It aims to facilitate access to coal reserves that would otherwise be economically unviable to mine.

**Sec. 50301. Timber Sales and Long-Term Contracting for the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management.**

This section seeks to increase timber sales and long-term contracting on both National Forest System land and public lands. It mandates the Forest Service to sell at least 250 million board feet more timber annually and enter into 40 long-term contracts, while the Bureau of Land Management must sell at least 20 million board feet more annually and enter into 5 long-term contracts. All revenue generated from these sales will be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury.

**Sec. 50302. Renewable Energy Fees on Federal Land.**

This section establishes a fee structure for renewable energy projects on Federal land, including acreage rents and capacity fees. It calculates acreage rent based on a formula incorporating per-acre rates and an annual adjustment factor, and capacity fees based on either acreage rent or a percentage of gross electricity sales. It also allows for a 10% reduction in capacity fees for wind energy projects meeting certain multiple-use criteria.

**Sec. 50303. Renewable Energy Revenue Sharing.**

This section establishes a revenue-sharing agreement for renewable energy projects on Federal land. Beginning in 2026, 25% of revenues will be paid to the state and 25% to the county where the project is located, with the remainder going to the Treasury. Payments to counties are in addition to existing payments in lieu of taxes.

**Sec. 50304. Rescission of National Park Service and Bureau of Land Management Funds.**

This section rescinds unobligated balances of funds previously allocated to the National Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Specific sections are identified for rescission.

This section provides additional funding for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). It allocates $218 million for maintenance and $171 million for acquiring petroleum products, totaling $389 million, to be available through September 30, 2029. It also repeals a mandate related to SPR drawdowns.

**Sec. 50402. Repeals; Rescissions.**

This section repeals and rescinds unobligated funds from several sections of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, targeting specific energy-related programs.

**Sec. 50403. Energy Dominance Financing.**

This section amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to broaden the scope of energy projects eligible for financing and increases the funding available for these projects to $1 billion, available through 2028. It also prioritizes projects that support energy supply and grid reliability.

**Sec. 50404. Transformational Artificial Intelligence Models.**

This section directs the Secretary of Energy to mobilize National Laboratories to curate scientific data for use in developing artificial intelligence models for microelectronics and new energy technologies. It allocates $150 million for this purpose, available through 2026.

**Sec. 50501. Water Conveyance and Surface Water Storage Enhancement.**

This section appropriates $1 billion to the Secretary of the Interior for construction and activities to restore or increase the capacity of existing water conveyance and storage facilities, to be available through September 30, 2034. It allows for these projects to proceed without certain regulatory hurdles and without requiring matching funds.
