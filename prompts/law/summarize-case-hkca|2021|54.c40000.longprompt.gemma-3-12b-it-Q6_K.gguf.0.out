## 1. Summary of Facts

Kwok Cheuk Kin and another (the Applicants) challenged the constitutionality of Hong Kong's New Territories Small House Policy (the Policy). The Policy, approved in 1972, allows male indigenous villagers of the New Territories (NTIIs) who descend through the male line from residents in 1898 to apply for permission to erect a small house on a suitable site within their village once in their lifetime. The Policy has specific criteria regarding eligibility, location, size, and construction. The Applicants argued the Policy discriminated based on social origin/birth and sex, violating articles 25 and 39 of the Basic Law and article 22 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights. The respondents (Director of Lands and others) and the interested party argued the Policy falls within the "lawful traditional rights and interests" of NTIIs, protected by Article 40 of the Basic Law, rendering it constitutional. The case arose from a previous judgment (Chow J, 2019) which found the Policy discriminatory but left open the question of whether Article 40 protected it.

## 2. Summary of Arguments

**Applicants' Arguments:**

*   **Unconstitutionality:** The Policy inherently discriminates based on social origin/birth and sex, violating the Basic Law and the Bill of Rights.
*   **Article 40 Does Not Protect:** Even if discriminatory, the Policy does not fall within the "lawful traditional rights and interests" protected by Article 40.
    *   "Lawful" requires justification and proportionality, which the Policy lacks.
    *   The "Ding Rights" (the right to apply for a small house) are not true rights or interests, merely a discretionary government policy.
    *   The Ding Rights are not "traditional" as they are not traceable to pre-1898 practices.

**Respondents' and Interested Party's Arguments:**

*   **Article 40 Protection:** The Policy *is* protected by Article 40 as it embodies the "lawful traditional rights and interests" of NTIIs.
*   **"Lawful" and "Traditional" Interpretation:**
    *   "Lawful" means lawful under Hong Kong law on 1 July 1997, not requiring pre-1898 legality.
    *   "Traditional" refers to rights and interests enjoyed by NTIIs prior to the Basic Law's drafting, not necessarily pre-1898.
*   **Tracing Exercise Not Required:** The focus should be on whether the Policy reflects a historical recognition of NTII rights, not a strict tracing of pre-1898 practices.
*   **Private Treaty Grants and Exchanges are Protected:** These forms of land grant are part of a recognized administrative policy and are traceable to pre-1898 practices.
*   **Policy's Continuity:** The Policy reflects a continuity of practices and agreements made before the handover, particularly those outlined in Annex III of the Joint Declaration.
*   **Delay and Standing:** The Applicants' delay in bringing the claim and lack of standing should have resulted in the judicial review being dismissed.



## 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The Court of Appeal’s judgment in *Kwok Cheuk Kin v Director of Lands* establishes several significant legal principles concerning the interpretation of Article 40 of the Basic Law and its interaction with other constitutional provisions. The core holding is that the Small House Policy, in its entirety, is constitutionally protected under Article 40.

**1. Contextual and Purposive Interpretation of Article 40:**

The Court reaffirmed the established principle of contextual and purposive interpretation of the Basic Law. This means that Article 40 must be understood within the broader framework of the Basic Law, the Joint Declaration, and the historical context surrounding the drafting and implementation of the Basic Law. The Court emphasized the importance of considering the factual context of the New Territories, including the historical status of NTIIs, the colonial administration's policies, and the evolution of land tenure systems.

**2. Defining "Lawful Traditional Rights and Interests":**

The Court rejected the Applicants’ restrictive interpretation of "lawful traditional rights and interests." It held that:

*   **"Traditional" does not require a strict tracing back to 1898:** While acknowledging the importance of historical context, the Court found the Judge’s tracing exercise overly restrictive. The focus should be on whether the right or interest reflects a historical recognition of NTII rights, not a precise reproduction of pre-1898 practices.  A right or interest can be considered "traceable" if it captures or reproduces the essential features of a right or interest enjoyed by the NTIIs before the New Territories Lease.
*   **"Lawful" means recognized as lawful in the Hong Kong legal system at the time of the Basic Law's promulgation (April 1990):** The Court rejected the argument that "lawful" requires adherence to Qing law or a later legal standard. The focus is on whether the right or interest was legally recognized and enforceable in Hong Kong at the time the Basic Law was drafted. This interpretation avoids rendering Article 40 a hollow promise by allowing later legal challenges to undermine established practices.

**3. The Ding Rights and Article 40 Protection:**

The Court unequivocally held that the "Ding Rights" – the right of male NTIIs to apply for a small house grant under the Small House Policy – fall within the scope of "lawful traditional rights and interests" protected by Article 40. This conclusion was based on:

*   **Historical Recognition:** The colonial government consistently recognized and facilitated the NTIIs’ custom of building houses on their land, evolving into the Small House Policy.
*   **Legal Framework:** The Policy was embedded in legislation (Buildings Ordinance) and administrative practices, demonstrating its legal recognition.
*   **Coherence with Other Basic Law Provisions:** The Court emphasized the importance of interpreting Article 40 in conjunction with Articles 120 and 122, which implement Annex III of the Joint Declaration. Annex III guarantees the continuation of existing land leases and related rights, including those associated with small house grants.
*   **CEDAW Reservations:** The Court considered the reservations made by both the UK and PRC governments regarding the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). These reservations, reflected in Schedule 5 of the SDO, effectively shield the Small House Policy from challenges based on sex discrimination, reinforcing its constitutional protection.

**4. Private Treaty Grants and Exchanges:**

The Court explicitly rejected the Judge’s finding that private treaty grants and exchanges were not protected under Article 40. The Court found that these forms of land grant were traceable to pre-1898 practices and were part of a recognized administrative policy. The Court emphasized that these grants facilitated the realization of the core right – the right to build a house – and were consistent with the historical context of land administration in the New Territories.

**5. Exclusion of Discrimination Challenges:**

The Court held that Article 40, when read in conjunction with Annex III and the CEDAW reservations, effectively excludes challenges to the Small House Policy based on discriminatory grounds (such as social origin/birth or sex). This is because the Policy’s inherent discrimination was recognized and accepted during the drafting of the Basic Law and the Joint Declaration, and the reservations reflect a deliberate decision to preserve existing practices despite their discriminatory nature.

**6. Relief and Delay/Standing:**

The Court reversed the lower court’s decision regarding relief, finding that the Applicants lacked standing and that the significant delay in bringing the claim warranted dismissal of the judicial review. The Court emphasized the prejudice caused to third parties and the importance of upholding good administrative practices.



**Novel and Controversial Points:**

*   **The Scope of "Traditional":** The Court’s rejection of a strict pre-1898 tracing exercise is a significant departure from a more literal interpretation of Article 40. This approach prioritizes the historical recognition of NTII rights over a rigid adherence to a specific historical date.
*   **The Interaction of Article 40 with Annex III and CEDAW:** The Court’s interpretation of Article 40 in light of Annex III and the CEDAW reservations is particularly noteworthy. It demonstrates a willingness to prioritize the preservation of pre-existing agreements and practices, even if they conflict with broader principles of equality. This approach has been criticized as potentially undermining the protection of fundamental rights.
*   **The Exclusion of Discrimination Challenges:** The Court’s finding that Article 40 effectively excludes discrimination challenges based on sex or social origin is likely to be controversial. It raises questions about the extent to which constitutional protections can be overridden by historical practices and international agreements.



The *Kwok Cheuk Kin* case represents a significant and complex interpretation of Article 40 of the Basic Law. It underscores the importance of historical context, the coherence of constitutional provisions, and the preservation of pre-existing agreements in interpreting Hong Kong’s constitutional framework. The case’s emphasis on protecting established practices, even those with discriminatory elements, has sparked debate about the balance between upholding historical rights and promoting equality.
