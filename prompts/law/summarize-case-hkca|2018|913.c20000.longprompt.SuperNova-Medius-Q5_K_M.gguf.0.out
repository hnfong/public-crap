### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case of HKSAR v. SO PING CHI [2018] HKCA 913 involves SO Ping Chi, a former General Manager and Principal Surveyor of Ships in the Local Vessel Safety Branch of the Marine Department in Hong Kong. Between April 2007 and August 2010, SO Ping Chi was responsible for enforcing the Merchant Shipping (Local Vessels) (Safety and Survey) Regulation, Cap 548G, which required vessels to provide life-saving equipment, including children's lifejackets.

The prosecution alleged that SO Ping Chi issued an instruction to his subordinates not to enforce the requirement for children's lifejackets on vessels licensed before January 2, 2007. This instruction was continued until October 2012, when it was rescinded following a tragic collision near Lamma Island. The prosecution argued that this instruction amounted to serious misconduct, as it allowed vessels to operate without compliance with the law, potentially endangering passengers' safety.

SO Ping Chi was convicted of misconduct in public office and sentenced to 16 months' imprisonment. He appealed against both his conviction and sentence, arguing that his actions were not serious enough to warrant criminal sanction and that the sentence was disproportionate.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments

**Defendant's Arguments:**
- SO Ping Chi's counsel argued that there was insufficient evidence to prove that SO Ping Chi had issued the non-enforcement instruction or that he had deliberately failed to rescind it.
- Even if the instruction was issued, his actions were not serious enough to warrant criminal sanction.
- SO Ping Chi had a reasonable excuse for continuing the non-enforcement instruction, namely the need to ensure the "smooth implementation" of the new lifejacket requirements.
- The new law made little practical difference to safety, and lifejackets suitable for adults were also suitable for children.

**Prosecution's Arguments:**
- The prosecution maintained that SO Ping Chi's actions amounted to serious misconduct, as he deliberately decided not to enforce lawfully enacted legislation.
- The non-enforcement instruction was unlawful and strictly impermissible, and there was no reasonable excuse for continuing it.
- SO Ping Chi's actions were serious enough to warrant criminal sanction, as they involved a blanket instruction covering all local vessels licensed before the new law was enacted.
- SO Ping Chi's actions eroded public trust in the Marine Department and the civil service system, and the consequences of his decision were potentially very serious.

### 3. Summary of the Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**Nonfeasance vs. Misfeasance:**
The Court of Appeal distinguished between nonfeasance (failure to perform a duty) and misfeasance (improper performance of a duty). In cases of nonfeasance, the mental element required is a wilful intent, accompanied by the absence of a reasonable excuse or justification. The Court emphasized that nonfeasance does not require a dishonest, corrupt, or malicious motive to be considered serious enough for criminal sanction.

**Wilfulness and Seriousness:**
The Court held that the appellant's misconduct was both wilful and serious. The non-enforcement instruction was deliberate and not inadvertent, and it directly countermanded the statutorily prescribed safety requirements. The Court found that the appellant's departure from his duty was an affront to the standing of the public office held and that his misconduct fell so far below acceptable standards as to amount to an abuse of the public trust.

**Reasonable Excuse or Justification:**
The Court rejected the appellant's argument that he had a reasonable excuse for his actions. The appellant did not consult his superior or seek legal advice before issuing the non-enforcement instruction, and he did not provide any explanation for his actions. The Court found that appeasing industry representatives and ensuring the "smooth implementation" of the new law did not amount to a reasonable excuse or justification.

**Sentence:**
The Court of Appeal found that the sentence of 16 months' imprisonment was excessive. The appellant had no dishonest, corrupt, or malicious motive, and he was an otherwise excellent civil servant. However, the Court noted that the appellant's actions were serious and that he had continued a policy that had been in place before him. The Court also considered that the appellant's successors had not been subject to criminal prosecution, which was a valid consideration for a sentencing court. The Court ultimately ordered that the appellant should be sentenced to time already served, so he would be immediately released.

**Key Points:**
- The Court emphasized that public officials have no right to decide that a law affecting public safety should not be enforced.
- The Court held that the mental element required for nonfeasance is a wilful intent, accompanied by the absence of a reasonable excuse or justification, and that this does not require a dishonest, corrupt, or malicious motive.
- The Court found that the appellant's actions were serious and that he had no reasonable excuse for his conduct.
- The Court considered the unusual circumstances of the case, including the fact that the appellant's successors had not been subject to criminal prosecution, in determining an appropriate sentence. 

These principles are significant as they clarify the mental element required for misconduct in public office and the circumstances under which such misconduct can be considered serious enough to warrant criminal sanction. The case also highlights the importance of public officials consulting their superiors and seeking legal advice before making decisions that affect public safety. [end of text]
