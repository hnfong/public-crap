**Sec. 80001. Exemption of Certain Assets.**
Effective July 1, 2026, for the 2026-2027 award year and subsequent years, the Higher Education Act is amended to exclude the net value of a family farm, a small business with no more than 100 full-time employees, and a commercial fishing business from the calculation of a family's net worth for federal student aid eligibility. These exemptions apply specifically to assets owned and controlled by the family residing on the farm or operating the business. This change aims to protect family-owned agricultural and small business assets when determining financial need for federal student aid.

**Sec. 81001. Establishment of Loan Limits for Graduate and Professional Students and Parent Borrowers; Termination of Graduate and Professional PLUS Loans.**
Beginning July 1, 2026, the bill terminates the authority to make interest-subsidized loans to graduate students and eliminates Federal Direct PLUS Loans for graduate and professional students entirely. New annual loan limits are set at $20,500 for non-professional graduate students and $50,000 for professional students, with aggregate limits capped at $100,000 for non-professional graduates and $200,000 for professional students. Additionally, parent borrowers are restricted to a maximum annual limit of $20,000 and an aggregate limit of $65,000 per dependent student, while the total lifetime aggregate limit for all students (excluding parent PLUS loans) is set at $257,500. Students enrolled in programs as of June 30, 2026, are grandfathered under the previous limits for up to three academic years or the remaining time to their credential.

**Sec. 82001. Loan Repayment.**
Starting July 1, 2026, the bill repeals Income Contingent Repayment (ICR) plans and replaces them with a new "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP) and a Standard Repayment Plan, requiring borrowers to choose between them. Under the RAP, monthly payments are calculated based on a percentage of adjusted gross income ranging from 1% to 10% depending on income levels, with a minimum payment of $10, and any unpaid interest is subsidized while principal reductions under $50 are matched by the Secretary. Borrowers with loans made on or after July 1, 2026, must repay under these new plans, with loan forgiveness available after 360 qualifying payments, while "excepted loans" like Parent PLUS loans must be repaid under the Standard Repayment Plan. Existing borrowers with ICR loans must transition to the new plans by July 1, 2028, or be automatically enrolled in the RAP.

**Sec. 82002. Deferment; Forbearance.**
For loans originated on or after July 1, 2027, the bill eliminates eligibility for economic hardship and unemployment deferments, which previously allowed borrowers to pause payments without accruing interest. Additionally, forbearance for these new loans is strictly limited to a maximum of 9 months within any 24-month period, removing the previous indefinite or longer-term forbearance options. These restrictions apply to all borrowers receiving loans under the Federal Direct Loan program after the specified effective date.

**Sec. 82003. Loan Rehabilitation.**
Effective July 1, 2027, the bill increases the number of times a borrower may rehabilitate a defaulted FFEL or Direct loan from one time to two times, and similarly allows Perkins loans to be rehabilitated twice. Furthermore, for loans made on or after July 1, 2027, the minimum monthly payment required for loan rehabilitation is set at $10, ensuring a baseline payment amount for borrowers entering the rehabilitation process. These changes apply to all loans made, insured, or guaranteed under Title IV of the Higher Education Act.

**Sec. 82004. Public Service Loan Forgiveness.**
The bill amends the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program to explicitly count on-time payments made under the new Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP) as qualifying payments toward loan forgiveness. This amendment ensures that borrowers participating in the new income-based repayment structure can still achieve forgiveness after 120 qualifying payments if they work in public service. The change aligns the new repayment plans with the existing PSLF requirements without altering the definition of qualifying employment.

**Sec. 82005. Student Loan Servicing.**
The bill appropriates $1,000,000,000 to the Secretary of Education to cover administrative costs associated with servicing Federal Direct student loans, including the costs of the new repayment plans. These funds are available until expended and are in addition to any other amounts appropriated for administrative costs under the relevant parts of the Higher Education Act. This funding is intended to support the transition to the new repayment systems and the management of the expanded loan portfolio.

**Sec. 83001. Eligibility.**
Beginning July 1, 2026, the calculation of a student's Student Aid Index (SAI) for Federal Pell Grant eligibility will include the foreign income of the student's parents or the student (if independent) in addition to their adjusted gross income. Additionally, the bill establishes a new ineligibility rule where students with an SAI equal to or exceeding twice the maximum Federal Pell Grant amount for that academic year will be barred from receiving the grant. These changes apply to all Pell Grant determinations for academic years beginning on or after July 1, 2026.

**Sec. 83002. Workforce Pell Grants.**
Starting July 1, 2026, the bill creates a new "Workforce Pell Grant" program for students enrolled in eligible workforce programs that are at least 150 clock hours but less than 600 clock hours, and do not lead to a graduate credential. To qualify, programs must be approved by the State Governor and the Secretary of Education, demonstrating a 70% completion rate, a 70% job placement rate within 180 days, and a positive value-added earnings metric where tuition does not exceed the difference between student median earnings and 150% of the poverty line. Grants are prorated for programs shorter than an academic year, and students cannot receive both a standard Pell Grant and a Workforce Pell Grant simultaneously.

**Sec. 83003. Pell Shortfall.**
The bill increases the funding authorization for the Federal Pell Grant program's shortfall from $2,170,000,000 to $12,670,000,000 to ensure sufficient funds are available to meet the demand for grants. This adjustment is made to Section 401(b)(7)(A)(iii) of the Higher Education Act to address the gap between authorized grant amounts and available appropriations. The increased funding is intended to support the expanded eligibility and new grant programs introduced in this legislation.

**Sec. 83004. Federal Pell Grant Exclusion Relating to Other Grant Aid.**
Effective July 1, 2026, the bill prohibits students from receiving a Federal Pell Grant during any period where they receive non-Federal grant aid (from states, institutions, or private sources) that equals or exceeds their total cost of attendance. This exclusion prevents "double-dipping" where a student's total financial aid package exceeds their educational expenses through a combination of federal and non-federal sources. The rule applies regardless of other Pell Grant eligibility criteria if the non-federal aid threshold is met.

**Sec. 84001. Ineligibility Based on Low Earning Outcomes.**
Beginning July 1, 2026, the bill makes institutions ineligible for federal student aid funds for any program where the median earnings of graduates are less than the median earnings of a working adult with a similar education level for at least two of the three years preceding the determination. The determination compares program graduates to working adults aged 25-34 with only a high school diploma (for undergraduate programs) or a bachelor's degree (for graduate programs), using Census data. Institutions are given an appeals process and a notice period, and programs can regain eligibility after two years of ineligibility if they meet new standards.

**Sec. 85001. Delay of Rule Relating to Borrower Defense to Repayment.**
The bill delays the implementation of the November 1, 2022, regulations regarding borrower defense to repayment for loans originating before July 1, 2035, effectively reverting to the rules in effect on July 1, 2020. This means that the stricter standards for loan discharge introduced in 2022 will not apply to these loans, and the previous, more lenient standards will remain in force. The delay applies to all provisions of subpart D of part 685 of title 34, Code of Federal Regulations, as amended by the 2022 final regulations.

**Sec. 85002. Delay of Rule Relating to Closed School Discharges.**
Similar to the borrower defense provisions, the bill delays the November 1, 2022, regulations regarding closed school loan discharges for loans originating before July 1, 2035, restoring the regulations as they existed prior to those amendments. This ensures that the criteria for discharging loans due to school closures remain at the pre-2022 level for the specified loan cohort. The affected regulations include sections 674.33(g), 682.402(d), and 685.214 of title 34, Code of Federal Regulations.

**Sec. 86001. Garden of Heroes.**
The bill appropriates $40,000,000 to the National Endowment for the Humanities for fiscal year 2025 to fund the procurement of statues for the National Garden of American Heroes, with funds remaining available through fiscal year 2028. This funding is designated for the construction and rebuilding of monuments to American heroes as directed by Executive Orders 13934, 13978, and 14189. The appropriation is made from money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated and is specifically for the purpose of honoring American heroes through physical monuments.

**Sec. 87001. Potential Sponsor Vetting for Unaccompanied Alien Children Appropriation.**
The bill appropriates $300,000,000 to the Office of Refugee Resettlement for fiscal year 2025 to fund comprehensive background checks, home studies, and data system improvements for potential sponsors of unaccompanied alien children. These funds must be used to verify the identity, residence, and criminal history of sponsors and all adult household residents, including checks against sex offender registries and national criminal history databases. Additionally, the funds support the examination of children for gang-related markings and coordination with state child welfare agencies to ensure safe placement. The appropriation remains available until September 30, 2028. [end of text]
