<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a lengthy tax bill and wants a summary of each section starting from Sec. 70401. They specified that for each section, I should give at most one paragraph with up to four sentences, be specific with parties, entities, and quantities, and be concise but not vague.

First, I need to parse the bill. The user mentioned it's a huge bill championed by President Trump, but the bill's text shows it's from 2025, which is in the future. Wait, the date in the bill is July 1, 2025. So this is a hypothetical or future bill. But the user says it's passed by Congress recently, so maybe it's a fictional scenario. Anyway, I should focus on the content provided.

The user wants a summary for every "Sec. XXXX" in the bill. The bill is structured into chapters and subchapters. The first section listed is Sec. 70401. Let me check the bill's table of contents. The table of contents shows Sec. 70401 under Subchapter A, which is about permanent investments in families and children.

Looking at Sec. 70401: Enhancement of employer-provided child care credit. The section has several subsections: (a) Increase of Amount of Qualified Child Care Expenditures Taken Into Account, (b) Increase of Maximum Credit Amount, (c) Eligible Small Business, (d) Credit Allowed for Third-party Intermediaries, (e) Treatment of Jointly Owned or Operated Child Care Facility, (f) Regulations and Guidance, and (g) Effective Date.

I need to summarize each of these subsections concisely. The user wants specific details: parties, entities, quantities. So for (a), it's changing the percentage from 25% to 40% (50% for eligible small businesses). The maximum credit is $500,000 ($600,000 for eligible small businesses), with inflation adjustments starting in 2026. The eligible small business is defined using a 5-taxable-year test instead of 3.

Wait, the user said "for every section 'Sec. XXXX'", so each Sec. number. So Sec. 70401 is one section, and the subsections (a), (b), etc., are parts of that section. But the user wants a summary for each Sec. XXXX, so I should summarize the entire Sec. 70401 as one section, not each subsection. The user's example in the query shows that for Sec. 70401, they have the entire section's content, so I need to summarize the whole section, not the subsections.

Wait, the user says "for every section 'Sec. XXXX' in the Bill." So each Sec. number is a separate section. So Sec. 70401 is one section, Sec. 70402 is another, etc. So I need to go through each Sec. XXXX listed in the table of contents and summarize each one.

Let me check the table of contents. The first section is Sec. 70401, then 70402, 70403, etc. So I need to process each of these sections one by one.

Starting with Sec. 70401. The section is about enhancing the employer-provided child care credit. The key points are:

- (a) Increases the percentage of qualified child care expenditures from 25% to 40% (50% for eligible small businesses).
- (b) Increases the maximum credit to $500,000 ($600,000 for eligible small businesses), with inflation adjustments starting in 2026.
- (c) Defines "eligible small business" using a 5-taxable-year gross receipts test instead of 3.
- (d) Allows credit for third-party intermediaries contracting with child care facilities.
- (e) Clarifies that jointly owned/operated facilities are still qualified.
- (f) Requires regulations and guidance.
- (g) Effective after Dec 31, 2025.

So the summary needs to capture all these points concisely. The user wants at most four sentences, specific entities and quantities. Let's see. The main changes are the percentage increase, the max credit amounts, the eligible small business definition, and the effective date.

Wait, the user said "for every Section ('Sec.'), give at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences." So each Sec. XXXX gets one paragraph. So Sec. 70401's summary should be one paragraph, up to four sentences.

Let me draft that. Start with the main change: increasing the credit percentage. Then the max credit amounts. Then the eligible small business definition. Then the effective date. Need to include all significant details without being vague.

So: "Sec. 70401 enhances the employer-provided child care credit by increasing the percentage of qualified expenditures from 25% to 40% (50% for eligible small businesses), raising the maximum credit to $500,000 ($600,000 for eligible small businesses) with inflation adjustments starting in 2026. An 'eligible small business' is defined as one meeting a 5-taxable-year gross receipts test under section 448(c), replacing the previous 3-year test. The section also permits credit for third-party intermediaries contracting with child care facilities and clarifies that jointly owned facilities remain qualified. Effective for amounts paid after December 31, 2025."

Check the sentences: that's four sentences. Let's verify the details. The percentage is 40% (50% for small businesses). Max credit $500k/$600k. Inflation adjustment for 2026. Eligible small business uses 5-taxable-year test. Third-party intermediaries allowed. Jointly owned facilities treated as qualified. Effective date Dec 31, 2025. That's all covered.

Next, Sec. 70402: Enhancement of Adoption Credit. The key points are making $5,000 of the credit refundable, adjusting for inflation with specific formulas, and excluding the refundable portion from carryforward.

So summary: "Sec. 70402 makes up to $5,000 of the adoption credit refundable, treating it as a credit under subpart C rather than the adoption credit subpart. It adjusts the credit amounts for inflation using a formula based on the 2001 cost-of-living adjustment, with specific substitutions for 2025. The refundable portion is excluded from carryforward, and the changes apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024."

Check: refundable up to $5k, inflation adjustment using 2001 as base but substituting 2025, exclusion from carryforward, effective 2025. Wait, the effective date is taxable years beginning after Dec 31, 2024. So the summary should mention that. Let me confirm the text: "The amendments made by this section shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024." So effective for 2025 tax years.

Sec. 70403: Recognizing Indian Tribal Governments for Adoption Credit. The change is adding "or Indian tribal government" to definitions in section 23(d)(3). So the summary should state that Indian tribal governments are now included in determining if a child has special needs for the adoption credit. Effective after Dec 31, 2024.

Sec. 70404: Enhancement of Dependent Care Assistance Program. Increases the limit from $5,000/$2,500 to $7,500/$3,750. Effective for taxable years after Dec 31, 2025.

Sec. 70405: Enhancement of Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit. Changes the applicable percentage to 50%, with reductions based on AGI: 1% per $2k over $15k, and further reduction of 1% per $2k over $75k (or $150k for joint returns). Effective after Dec 31, 2025.

Moving to Subchapter B. Sec. 70411: Tax Credit for Contributions to Scholarship Granting Organizations. Creates a new credit of up to $1,700 for contributions to scholarship organizations, with state participation requirements. The credit is excluded from charitable contributions under section 170. Effective after Dec 31, 2026.

Wait, the section says "the amendments made by this section shall apply to taxable years ending after December 31, 2026." So effective for tax years ending after 2026.

Sec. 70412: Exclusion for Employer Payments of Student Loans. Removes the January 1, 2026, cutoff, allowing unlimited exclusion for payments after Dec 31, 2025. Inflation adjustment increases the $5,250 limit. Effective for payments after Dec 31, 2025.

Sec. 70413: Additional Expenses Treated as Qualified Higher Education Expenses for 529 Accounts. Expands qualified expenses to include tutoring, standardized tests, dual enrollment, and educational therapies. Increases the annual limit from $10k to $20k. Effective for distributions after enactment.

Sec. 70414: Certain Postsecondary Credentialing Expenses Treated as Qualified. Defines qualified postsecondary credentialing expenses, including tuition, fees, testing, and continuing education. Requires programs to be on state lists or recognized by federal agencies. Effective for distributions after enactment.

Sec. 70415: Modification of Excise Tax on Investment Income of Private Colleges. Changes the tax rates to 1.4%, 4%, and 8% based on student-adjusted endowment. Requires reporting on student numbers and investment income. Effective for taxable years after Dec 31, 2025.

Sec. 70416: Expanding Application of Tax on Excess Compensation. Broadens the definition of "covered employee" to include former employees and those with predecessors. Effective for taxable years after Dec 31, 2025.

Subchapter C: Sec. 70421: Permanent Renewal and Enhancement of Opportunity Zones. Decennial designations starting July 1, 2026, with 10-year periods. Repeals Puerto Rico special rule. Modifies low-income community definitions and capital gains rules. Effective for areas designated after enactment.

Sec. 70422: Permanent Enhancement of Low-Income Housing Tax Credit. Increases the state housing credit ceiling from 1.125 to 1.12. Adjusts the tax-exempt bond financing requirement to 50% or 25% with specific conditions. Effective for buildings placed in service after Dec 31, 2025.

Sec. 70423: Permanent Extension of New Markets Tax Credit. Extends the credit beyond 2025, allowing it for all calendar years after 2019. Adjusts carryover rules to allow up to 5 years. Effective for calendar years after Dec 31, 2025.

Sec. 70424: Permanent and Expanded Reinstatement of Partial Deduction for Charitable Contributions. Increases the non-itemizer deduction from $300/$600 to $1,000/$2,000. Effective for taxable years after Dec 31, 2025.

Sec. 70425: 0.5 Percent Floor on Deduction of Contributions by Individuals. Requires charitable contributions to exceed 0.5% of contribution base, with specific ordering of contributions. Effective for taxable years after Dec 31, 2025.

Sec. 70426: 1 Percent Floor on Deduction of Charitable Contributions by Corporations. Limits corporate deductions to 1-10% of taxable income, with 5-year carryforward. Effective for taxable years after Dec 31, 2025.

Sec. 70427: Permanent Increase in Limitation on Cover Over of Tax on Distilled Spirits. Raises the cover-over limit from $13.25 to $13.25 (wait, the text says "Paragraph (1) of section 7652(f) is amended to read as follows: (1) $13.25, or". Wait, the original was $13.25, so maybe it's a typo, but the amendment just keeps it at $13.25. Wait, the bill says "permanent increase", but the text shows it's amended to read "$13.25, or". Wait, maybe the original was a different amount, but the amendment just restates it. Wait, the original section 7652(f)(1) probably had a different amount, but the bill amends it to "$13.25, or". So the effective change is that the cover-over limit is set at $13.25. Wait, but the section title says "permanent increase", so maybe the previous amount was lower. But according to the text, the amendment is to read "$13.25, or", so the new amount is $13.25. So the summary should state that the cover-over limit is set at $13.25 for distilled spirits brought in after Dec 31, 2025.

Sec. 70428: Nonprofit Community Development Activities in Remote Native Villages. Allows activities related to fisheries in Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands to be considered substantially related to nonprofit purposes. Includes transfer of subsidiary assets without gain recognition. Effective on enactment, lasting through the western Alaska community development quota program.

Subchapter D: Sec. 70431: Expansion of Qualified Small Business Stock Gain Exclusion. Phases in higher exclusion percentages (50% for 3 years, 75% for 4, 100% for 5+), increases the per issuer limit to $10M/$15M, and raises the gross assets limit to $75M. Effective for taxable years after enactment.

Sec. 70432: Repeal of Revision to De Minimis Rules. Restores the $20k threshold and 200 transactions for third-party network transactions. Effective as if included in the American Rescue Plan Act.

Sec. 70433: Increase in Threshold for Information Reporting. Raises the reporting threshold from $600 to $2,000, with inflation adjustments. Effective for payments after Dec 31, 2025.

Sec. 70434: Treatment of Certain Qualified Sound Recording Productions. Adds sound recordings to the list of productions eligible for immediate expensing, with a $150k limit. Effective for productions commencing after enactment.

Sec. 70435: Exclusion of Interest on Loans Secured by Rural or Agricultural Real Property. Excludes 25% of interest on qualified loans, defined for banks, insurers, and certain entities. Effective for taxable years after enactment.

Sec. 70438: Extension of Disaster-Related Casualty Loss Rules. Extends the application of certain disaster tax relief by substituting the bill's enactment date. Effective immediately.

Sec. 70439: Restoration of Taxable REIT Subsidiary Asset Test. Increases the asset test from 20% to 25%. Effective for taxable years after Dec 31, 2025.

Now, I need to make sure each summary is one paragraph, max four sentences, specific with entities and quantities. Let me check each one.

Starting with Sec. 70401: The summary I drafted earlier seems good. Let me confirm the numbers: 40% (50% for small businesses), $500k/$600k, 5-taxable-year test. Yes.

Sec. 70402: Refundable up to $5k, inflation adjustment using 2001 base but substituting 2025, effective 2025. Wait, the effective date is taxable years beginning after Dec 31, 2024, so 2025 tax years. The inflation adjustment uses 2001 as the base year but substitutes 2025. The text says "substituting '2025' for '2002' in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), and 'calendar year 2024' for 'calendar year 2001' in subparagraph (B) thereof." So the inflation adjustment for the refundable portion uses 2024 as the base year. So the summary should mention that.

Wait, the user wants specific quantities. So for Sec. 70402: "Sec. 70402 makes the first $5,000 of the adoption credit refundable, treating it as a subpart C credit, and adjusts all credit amounts for inflation using a formula based on the 2001 cost-of-living adjustment with substitutions for 2025 and 2024. The refundable portion is excluded from carryforward, and the changes apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024."

That's three sentences. Good.

Sec. 70403: "Sec. 70403 adds 'or Indian tribal government' to definitions in section 23(d)(3), allowing tribal governments to determine if a child has special needs for the adoption credit. Effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2024."

Two sentences. Good.

Sec. 70404: "Sec. 70404 increases the dependent care assistance program limit from $5,000/$2,500 to $7,500/$3,750, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025."

One sentence. Perfect.

Sec. 70405: "Sec. 70405 revises the child and dependent care credit to allow a 50% applicable percentage, reduced by 1% per $2,000 of AGI over $15,000 (or $75,000 for joint returns), effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025."

One sentence. Wait, the text says "reduced (but not below 35 percent) by 1 percentage point for each $2,000 or fraction thereof by which the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for the taxable year exceeds $15,000, and further reduced (but not below 20 percent) by 1 percentage point for each $2,000 ($4,000 in the case of a joint return) or fraction thereof by which the taxpayer's adjusted gross income for the taxable year exceeds $75,000 ($150,000 in the case of a joint return)." So the summary should mention the thresholds: $15k, $75k (joint $150k), and the reductions. So the summary should include those numbers. So maybe: "Sec. 70405 sets the applicable percentage for the child and dependent care credit at 50%, reduced by 1% per $2,000 of AGI over $15,000 (or $75,000 for joint returns), with a floor of 20%, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025."

Yes, that's concise and includes the key numbers.

Moving to Sec. 70411: "Sec. 70411 creates a new $1,700 nonrefundable credit for contributions to scholarship granting organizations, requiring states to voluntarily elect participation and list eligible organizations, with the credit excluded from charitable contributions under section 170, effective for taxable years ending after December 31, 2026."

Wait, the credit is nonrefundable? The section says "the credit allowed under subsection (a) to any taxpayer for any taxable year shall not exceed $1,700." So it's a nonrefundable credit. The summary should mention that. Also, the credit is excluded from charitable contributions under section 170. So the summary should include that. Effective for taxable years ending after Dec 31, 2026.

Sec. 70412: "Sec. 70412 removes the January 1, 2026, cutoff for employer student loan payments, allowing unlimited exclusion for payments after December 31, 2025, with the $5,250 limit subject to inflation adjustments starting in 2026."

Wait, the section says "Section 127(c)(1)(B) is amended by striking 'in the case of payments made before January 1, 2026,'." So the cutoff is removed, so payments after Dec 31, 2025 are covered. The inflation adjustment increases the $5,250 amount. So the summary should say the $5,250 limit is subject to inflation adjustments. So: "Sec. 70412 eliminates the January 1, 2026, deadline for employer student loan payments, allowing exclusions for payments after December 31, 2025, and increases the $5,250 annual limit with inflation adjustments starting in 2026."

Yes, that's good.

Sec. 70413: "Sec. 70413 expands 529 qualified expenses to include tutoring, standardized tests, dual enrollment, and educational therapies, and raises the annual distribution limit from $10,000 to $20,000, effective for distributions after the bill's enactment."

Check: the section says "the last sentence of section 529(e)(3) is amended by striking '$10,000' and inserting '$20,000'." So the annual limit is $20k. The new expenses are listed. Effective for distributions after enactment.

Sec. 70414: "Sec. 70414 defines 'qualified postsecondary credentialing expenses' to include tuition, testing, and continuing education for recognized programs, requiring state or federal recognition, effective for distributions after enactment."

The section defines the expenses and the requirements for the programs. So the summary should mention the types of expenses and the recognition requirements.

Sec. 70415: "Sec. 70415 modifies the excise tax on private colleges' investment income to 1.4%, 4%, or 8% based on student-adjusted endowment thresholds, requiring reporting of student numbers and investment income, effective for taxable years after December 31, 2025."

The tax rates are 1.4% for $500k-$750k endowment, 4% for $750k-$2M, 8% over $2M. The section also requires reporting on student numbers and investment income. So the summary should include the tax rates and the reporting requirement.

Sec. 70416: "Sec. 70416 broadens the definition of 'covered employee' for excess compensation tax to include former employees and those with predecessor organizations, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025."

The original definition was limited to current employees, now includes former and predecessors.

Subchapter C:

Sec. 70421: "Sec. 70421 establishes decennial opportunity zone designations starting July 1, 2026, with 10-year periods, revises low-income community definitions to include 20% poverty rate thresholds, and modifies capital gains rules for investments held 5+ years, effective for areas designated after enactment."

Wait, the section has several parts: decennial designations, qualification for designations (low-income communities), application of special rules for capital gains, information reporting, and Secretary reporting. The summary should capture the main points: decennial designations starting July 1, 2026, 10-year periods, revised low-income definitions (70% median income or 20% poverty rate with 125% median), and capital gains rules (deferral, 5-year and 10-year rules). The information reporting and Secretary reporting are also part of it, but maybe the summary can focus on the key changes. The user wants concise, so maybe mention the decennial designations, the revised definitions, and the capital gains rules.

Wait, the user said "keep all significant details." So the key changes are the decennial designations, the new low-income community criteria, and the capital gains rules. So the summary should include those. The effective date is for areas designated after enactment.

Sec. 70422: "Sec. 70422 increases the low-income housing credit state ceiling from 1.125 to 1.12 and modifies the tax-exempt bond financing requirement to 50% or 25% with specific conditions, effective for buildings placed in service after December 31, 2025."

The original ceiling was 1.125, now 1.12. The bond financing: 50% or 25% with the 5% threshold. So the summary should mention the ceiling increase and the bond requirement changes.

Sec. 70423: "Sec. 70423 permanently extends the New Markets Tax Credit beyond 2025, applying to all calendar years after 2019, and allows a 5-year carryforward for unused credits, effective for calendar years after December 31, 2025."

The section amends the credit to apply for all calendar years after 2019, and adjusts the carryover to 5 years. So the summary should state the extension beyond 2025, the new effective period, and the carryover rule.

Sec. 70424: "Sec. 70424 increases the non-itemizer charitable contribution deduction from $300/$600 to $1,000/$2,000, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025."

Simple enough.

Sec. 70425: "Sec. 70425 imposes a 0.5% floor on individual charitable deductions, requiring contributions to exceed 0.5% of the contribution base, with specific ordering of contributions, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025."

The 0.5% floor, contribution base, and the ordering (subparagraphs D, C, B, E, A, G).

Sec. 70426: "Sec. 70426 imposes a 1% floor on corporate charitable deductions, limiting them to 1-10% of taxable income with a 5-year carryforward, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025."

The 1% floor, 10% cap, 5-year carryforward.

Sec. 70427: "Sec. 70427 sets the distilled spirits cover-over tax limit at $13.25, effective for spirits brought into the U.S. after December 31, 2025."

Wait, the section says "Paragraph (1) of section 7652(f) is amended to read as follows: (1) $13.25, or". So the limit is $13.25. The title says "permanent increase," but the amendment just restates the amount. So the summary should state the limit is $13.25.

Sec. 70428: "Sec. 70428 allows nonprofit fisheries activities in Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands to qualify as community development, permitting asset transfers without gain recognition, effective on enactment through the western Alaska community development quota program."

The key points: nonprofit activities related to fisheries in those areas are considered substantially related, asset transfers without gain, effective on enactment.

Sec. 70429: "Sec. 70429 increases the charitable deduction limit for Native Alaskan subsistence whaling from $10,000 to $50,000, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2025."

Simple.

Sec. 70430: "Sec. 70430 replaces 'home construction' with 'residential construction' in the percentage of completion method, extending the 2-year test to 3 years, effective for contracts entered into after enactment."

The section amends section 460(e) to change home to residential construction and adjust the test from 2-year to 3-year.

Subchapter D:

Sec. 70431: "Sec. 70431 phases in higher qualified small business stock gain exclusions (50% for 3 years, 75% for 4, 100% for 5+), increases the per issuer limit to $10 million (acquired before) or $15 million (acquired after), and raises the gross assets limit to $75 million, effective for taxable years after enactment."

The key points: exclusion percentages, per issuer limits, gross assets limit.

Sec. 70432: "Sec. 70432 reinstates the $20,000 threshold and 200 transaction de minimis rule for third-party network transactions, effective as if included in the American Rescue Plan Act."

The de minimis rule was revised by the American Rescue Plan, and this bill repeals that revision, restoring the old rule.

Sec. 70433: "Sec. 70433 raises the information reporting threshold from $600 to $2,000, with inflation adjustments starting in 2026, effective for payments after December 31, 2025."

The threshold is $2k, inflation adjustments.

Sec. 70434: "Sec. 70434 adds qualified sound recording productions to the list of eligible productions for immediate expensing, with a $150,000 limit on aggregate costs, effective for productions commencing after enactment."

The $150k limit on aggregate costs for sound recordings.

Sec. 70435: "Sec. 70435 excludes 25% of interest on loans secured by rural or agricultural real estate, defined for banks, insurers, and certain entities, effective for taxable years after enactment."

The 25% exclusion, qualified lenders, and the definition of rural/agricultural real estate.

Sec. 70436: "Sec. 70436 eliminates transfer and manufacturing taxes on non-machinegun firearms, effective for calendar quarters starting more than 90 days after enactment."

The tax rate is $0 for non-machineguns, $200 for machineguns/destructive devices.

Sec. 70437: "Sec. 70437 allows 4 equal installments for capital gains from farmland sales to qualified farmers, with acceleration clauses for failure to pay, effective for sales after enactment."

The 4 installments, acceleration for failure to pay, qualified farmers.

Sec. 70438: "Sec. 70438 extends disaster-related casualty loss rules by substituting the bill's enactment date for the Taxpayer Certainty Act's date, effective immediately."

The extension applies the rules by substituting the bill's enactment date.

Sec. 70439: "Sec. 70439 increases the taxable REIT subsidiary asset test from 20% to 25%, effective for taxable years after December 31, 2025."

The asset test is now 25%.

Now, I need to make sure each summary is one paragraph, max four sentences, specific. Let me check each one again for conciseness and key details.

For example, Sec. 70421: The summary I had was "Sec. 70421 establishes decennial opportunity zone designations starting July 1, 2026, with 10-year periods, revises low-income community definitions to include 20% poverty rate thresholds, and modifies capital gains rules for investments held 5+ years, effective for areas designated after enactment."

Wait, the section also includes information reporting requirements and Secretary reporting. But the user wants concise, so maybe the key changes are the decennial designations, the low-income definitions, and the capital gains rules. The information reporting is part of the section, but maybe it's a detail that can be omitted for brevity. The user said "keep all significant details," so perhaps the information reporting is significant. But the summary is limited to four sentences. Let me check the original section: Sec. 70421 has parts (a) through (e), with (a) being decennial designations, (b) qualification for designations, (c) application of special rules for capital gains, (d) information reporting, (e) Secretary reporting. So the significant details are all these parts. But the summary needs to be concise. So maybe: "Sec. 70421 creates decennial opportunity zone designations starting July 1, 2026, with 10-year periods, revises low-income community criteria to include 20% poverty rates, modifies capital gains deferral rules (including 5-year and 10-year increases), and mandates annual reporting by funds and businesses, effective for areas designated after enactment."

That's four sentences. Wait, but the user said at most four sentences. So maybe combine into three. Let's see: "Sec. 70421 establishes decennial opportunity zone designations beginning July 1, 2026, with 10-year periods, revises low-income community definitions to require 20% poverty rates or 70% median income thresholds, modifies capital gains deferral rules (including 10% basis increase for 5-year holdings), and requires annual reporting by qualified opportunity funds, effective for areas designated after enactment."

That's one sentence. Wait, but the user allows up to four sentences. So maybe split into two or three. But the user said "at most one paragraph of at most 4 sentences." So one paragraph, up to four sentences. So for Sec. 70421, the summary can be up to four sentences. Let's structure it as:

Sec. 70421 establishes decennial opportunity zone designations starting July 1, 2026, with 10-year periods, replacing the previous sunset. It revises low-income community criteria to include 20% poverty rates or 70% median income thresholds, and modifies capital gains rules to allow 10% basis increases for 5-year holdings. The section also mandates annual reporting by qualified opportunity funds on asset values, employment, and investments, and requires the IRS to publish annual reports on economic impacts. Effective for areas designated after the bill's enactment.

That's four sentences. Good.

Similarly, check other sections. For example, Sec. 70431: "Sec. 70431 phases in higher qualified small business stock gain exclusions (50% for 3 years, 75% for 4, 100% for 5+), increases the per issuer limit to $10 million (acquired before the applicable date) or $15 million (acquired after), and raises the gross assets limit from $50 million to $75 million, effective for taxable years beginning after enactment."

Wait, the section says "the $50,000,000 amounts in paragraphs (1)(A) and (1)(B) shall each be increased by an amount equal to..." so the gross assets limit is raised to $75 million. So the summary should mention that. So the summary I have is correct.

Another check: Sec. 70435. The exclusion is 25% of interest on qualified real estate loans. The qualified lenders include banks, insurers, etc. So the summary says "excludes 25% of interest on loans secured by rural or agricultural real estate, defined for banks, insurers, and certain entities, effective for taxable years after enactment." That's correct.

I think all the summaries are covered. Now, I need to make sure each one is specific with entities and quantities. For example, in Sec. 70427, the cover-over limit is $13.25, so the summary should state that. In Sec. 70436, the tax is $200 for machineguns/destructive devices and $0 for others. So the summary should mention that.

Wait, in Sec. 70436, the summary says "eliminates transfer and manufacturing taxes on non-machinegun firearms," but the actual tax is $0 for non-machineguns, and $200 for machineguns/destructive devices. So the summary should clarify that the tax is $0 for non-machineguns, not eliminated entirely. So the correct summary is: "Sec. 70436 sets transfer and manufacturing taxes on firearms to $200 for machineguns or destructive devices and $0 for all other firearms, effective for calendar quarters starting more than 90 days after enactment."

Yes, that's better. So I need to adjust that summary.

Similarly, for Sec. 70439: "Sec. 70439 increases the taxable REIT subsidiary asset test from 20% to 25%, effective for taxable years after December 31, 2025."

That's correct.

Okay, I think I've covered all sections. Now, let's compile the list starting from Sec. 70401 as per the user's instruction.
