Need to ensure each is concise, 1-4 sentences, specific with dates, entities (like SFEs, FIEs, PFEs), percentages, and key changes. Avoid jargon where possible but keep specifics. Check that all sections from 70501 onwards are covered, including the Chapter 6 sections (70601-70607). Make sure not to miss details like effective dates, dollar amounts, or specific amendments (e.g., which Code sections are modified).</seed:think>### Sec. 70501: Termination of Previously-Owned Clean Vehicle Credit
