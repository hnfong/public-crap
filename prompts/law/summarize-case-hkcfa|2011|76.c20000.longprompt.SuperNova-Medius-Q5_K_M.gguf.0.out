### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case involves a dispute over the validity of two wills left by Mrs Nina Wang, a prominent Hong Kong businesswoman. The first will, dated July 28, 2002, named the Chinache Charitable Foundation Ltd (the Foundation) as the beneficiary. The second will, dated October 16, 2006, was proposed by the Applicant, Chan Chun Chuen, who claimed it entitled him to the entirety of Nina Wang's estate. The Foundation sought a declaration that the 2006 Will was a forgery and that the 2002 Will was valid. After a 40-day trial, Lam J found the 2006 Will to be a forgery. The Court of Appeal upheld this decision, and Chan Chun Chuen then applied for leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal (CFA).

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**Applicant's Arguments:**
- The case should be considered as of right under section 22(1)(a) of the Court of Final Appeal Ordinance, as it involves a claim to property or a civil right exceeding $1 million.
- Alternatively, the case should be considered under the discretionary grounds, as it involves a question of great general or public importance regarding the Court's practice on concurrent findings of fact.
- The Court of Appeal's review of the trial judge's findings was inadequate, and the new evidence (Police statements from Winfield Wong) undermines the credibility of a crucial witness and suggests a risk of miscarriage of justice.

**Foundation's Arguments:**
- The case does not qualify for leave as of right under section 22(1)(a) because the claim is not for a particular property or proprietary right, but rather for a declaration regarding the validity of a will.
- The Court of Appeal's review was thorough and adequate, and the new evidence does not provide a reasonable basis for overturning the findings of fact.
- The Court's established practice regarding concurrent findings of fact should not be disturbed.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**Section 22(1)(a) of the Court of Final Appeal Ordinance:**
- The Court held that the second limb of section 22(1)(a) should be narrowly construed, limiting it to claims for a particular property or proprietary right of the requisite value.
- A claim for a declaration regarding the validity of a will does not qualify as a claim to a particular property or proprietary right under this section.
- The immediacy requirement means that the order sought must have an immediate and quantifiable financial impact on the parties, without the need for further adjudicatory processes.

**Practice on Concurrent Findings of Fact:**
- The Court reaffirmed its established practice of not reviewing concurrent findings of fact made by the trial judge and the Court of Appeal unless there is a miscarriage of justice or a violation of a principle of law or procedure.
- The Court emphasized that the practice is necessary to balance the interests of litigants and the proper administration of justice, and to avoid unnecessary prolongation of litigation.
- The Court held that the new evidence did not provide a reasonable basis for overturning the findings of fact, as the alleged inconsistencies were inconsequential and did not undermine the central findings.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case

**Complexity and Length of the Trial:**
- The 40-day trial and the extensive review by the Court of Appeal and the Court of Final Appeal highlight the complexity and significance of the case, involving detailed forensic analysis and expert testimony.

**Significance of the Will:**
- The case involves a dispute over a will that potentially controls a vast fortune, estimated to be worth billions of dollars. This underscores the high stakes involved and the potential impact on the distribution of a significant estate.

**Challenges to Established Practices:**
- The case presents a challenge to the established practice of not reviewing concurrent findings of fact, which the Court ultimately upheld. This highlights the importance of maintaining judicial efficiency and the finality of decisions in complex probate cases.

**Use of New Evidence:**
- The introduction of new evidence (Police statements) to challenge the findings of fact demonstrates the ongoing scrutiny and potential for new evidence to impact legal proceedings, even after multiple levels of review.

**Implications for Probate Law:**
- The case has implications for the interpretation of wills and the standards for proving forgery, particularly in high-profile and high-value cases. It underscores the importance of clear and unambiguous language in wills and the scrutiny that such documents may face in probate disputes. 

**Potential for Reconsideration of "As of Right" Appeals:**
- The Court's suggestion that the "as of right" basis for appeals to the Court of Final Appeal should be reconsidered reflects a broader trend in legal systems to limit the scope of appeals to the highest courts, emphasizing the importance of finality and judicial efficiency. 

These aspects of the case make it a significant and noteworthy decision in the context of probate law and appellate practice. [end of text]
