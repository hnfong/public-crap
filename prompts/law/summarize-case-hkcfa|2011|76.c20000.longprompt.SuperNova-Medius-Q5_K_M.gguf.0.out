### 1. Facts of the Case

The case of Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v Chan Chun Chuen and Another [2011] HKCFA 76 involves a dispute over the validity of two wills left by Mrs Nina Wang, who passed away in 2007. The first will, dated July 28, 2002, named the Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd (the Foundation) as the beneficiary. The second will, dated October 16, 2006, was proposed by the Applicant, Chan Chun Chuen, who claimed it entitled him to the entirety of Nina Wang's estate.

After a 40-day trial, Lam J found that the 2006 Will was a forgery and declared the 2002 Will valid. The Applicant appealed to the Court of Appeal, which dismissed the appeal. The Applicant then sought leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal (CFA), arguing that the case met the criteria for leave to appeal as of right or on discretionary grounds.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**Applicant's Arguments:**

1. **As of Right Ground:** The Applicant argued that the case met the criteria for leave to appeal as of right under section 22(1)(a) of the Court of Final Appeal Ordinance. He contended that the appeal involved a claim or question to or respecting property or some civil right amounting to or of the value of $1,000,000 or more. He also argued that the case involved a unique character of probate actions and that the Court should adopt the approach of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in Re White (No 2).

2. **Important Question Ground:** The Applicant argued that the Court should review its established practice regarding concurrent findings of fact, as it was a matter of great general or public importance. He contended that the Court's practice of not reviewing concurrent findings unless there was a miscarriage of justice or violation of a principle of law or procedure should be reconsidered.

3. **New Evidence Ground:** The Applicant sought to introduce fresh evidence, specifically Police statements from Winfield Wong, which he claimed would undermine the credibility of Wong's testimony and create a risk of a miscarriage of justice.

**Foundation's Arguments:**

1. **As of Right Ground:** The Foundation argued that the case did not meet the criteria for leave to appeal as of right. They contended that the claim was not for a particular property or proprietary right, but merely for a pronouncement on the validity of the 2006 Will. They also argued that the "immediacy requirement" was not satisfied, as the financial impact of the appeal was not immediately quantifiable.

2. **Discretionary Leave:** The Foundation argued that the Applicant had not demonstrated reasonably arguable grounds for overturning the findings of the trial Judge and the Court of Appeal. They contended that the Court should not interfere with concurrent findings of fact unless there was a miscarriage of justice or a violation of a principle of law or procedure.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**1. Leave to Appeal as of Right:**

The Court held that the proper approach to an application for leave to appeal based on the second limb of section 22(1)(a) should be narrowly construed. The claim must be for a particular property or proprietary right, and the value of the claim must be clearly quantifiable in the sum of $1 million or more. The Court emphasized that the order sought must have the immediate effect of conferring or imposing a financial benefit or detriment in the quantified amount.

**2. Concurrent Findings of Fact:**

The Court reaffirmed its established practice regarding concurrent findings of fact. The Court will not review such findings unless there is a miscarriage of justice or a violation of a principle of law or procedure. The Court noted that this practice is important for the proper distribution of functions between the three court levels and to avoid unnecessary prolongation of litigation.

**3. Fresh Evidence:**

The Court examined the proposed new evidence and found that it did not undermine the crucial evidence relied upon by the Judge. The Court held that the alleged discrepancies in Winfield Wong's testimony were inconsequential and did not create a risk of a miscarriage of justice. The Court also noted that the evidence did not provide a reasonable basis for overturning the concurrent findings of the trial Judge and the Court of Appeal.

**4. Reconsideration of "As of Right" Basis for Appeals:**

The Court expressed a view that the "as of right" basis for appeals to the Court of Final Appeal should be reconsidered. The Court noted that all major Commonwealth jurisdictions and England and Wales have abandoned this right of appeal, and the public interest strongly favors a similar course in Hong Kong.

These principles highlight the Court's commitment to limiting appeals to the Court of Final Appeal to cases of significant public importance or where there is a clear miscarriage of justice, and its reluctance to interfere with findings of fact made by lower courts. The case also underscores the importance of the "immediacy requirement" in determining whether a claim qualifies for leave to appeal as of right. [end of text]
