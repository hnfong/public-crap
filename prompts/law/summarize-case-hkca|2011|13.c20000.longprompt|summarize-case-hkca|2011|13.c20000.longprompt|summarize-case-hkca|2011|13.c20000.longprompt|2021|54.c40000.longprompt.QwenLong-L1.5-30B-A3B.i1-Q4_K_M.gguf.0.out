Okay, let's tackle this case summary. The user provided a detailed judgment from the Hong Kong Court of Appeal in KWOK CHEUK KIN AND ANOTHER v. DIRECTOR OF LANDS AND OTHERS [2021] HKCA 54. The task is to break it down into four parts: facts, arguments, legal principles (ratio decidendi), and any striking aspects.

First, I need to understand the case. The main issue is the constitutionality of the New Territories Small House Policy (SH Policy) under the Basic Law. The applicants challenged it as discriminatory based on social origin/birth and sex, violating BL25, BL39, and BOR22. The respondents argued that the policy is protected under BL40 as the "lawful traditional rights and interests of the indigenous inhabitants of the New Territories" (NTIIs).

Starting with the facts. The SH Policy was introduced in 1972, allowing male indigenous villagers to build a small house once in their lifetime on their own land. The policy has three forms: free building licence, private treaty grant, and land exchange. The applicants argued it's discriminatory because it's based on sex (only males) and social origin (only NTIIs). The lower court (Chow J) ruled that the policy is discriminatory but that the free building licence part is protected under BL40, while private treaty grant and exchange aren't. The appeals court (Poon CJ) overturned that, saying the entire policy is protected under BL40.

Wait, so the key point is whether the SH Policy falls under BL40's protection. The lower court split the policy into parts, but the Court of Appeal said the whole thing is protected. I need to make sure I get the facts right. The policy's history, the legal challenges, the lower court's decision, and the appeals court's reversal.

Next, the arguments of the two parties. The applicants (Kwok Cheuk Kin and others) argued that the SH Policy is discriminatory and not protected by BL40 because it's unlawful under equality provisions. They also said the "Ding Rights" (the right to apply for a small house) aren't actual rights but discretionary government policy. The respondents (Director of Lands, etc.) and the interested party (Heung Yee Kuk) argued that the SH Policy is a traditional right protected by BL40, and the policy's discriminatory nature is shielded by BL40 and the CEDAW reservations.

Wait, the CEDAW reservations are important here. The UK and PRC made reservations to CEDAW to allow the SH Policy's discriminatory aspects to continue. So the Court of Appeal used that to argue that the policy isn't unlawful under the BOR because of the reservations.

Now, the legal principles (ratio decidendi). The Court of Appeal focused on the interpretation of BL40. They rejected the lower court's tracing exercise, saying that "traditional" doesn't require tracing back to 1898 but refers to rights recognized as traditional at the time of the Basic Law's promulgation in 1990. They also emphasized the coherence of the Basic Law, reading BL40 with BL120 and BL122, which protect land leases and small house grants. The Court held that the SH Policy is a lawful traditional right because it was recognized in the legal system since the colonial era, and the CEDAW reservations confirm its legality despite discrimination.

Wait, the lower court thought the policy had to be traced back to pre-1898 customs, but the Court of Appeal said that's not necessary. Instead, the rights just need to be recognized as traditional at the time of the Basic Law's drafting. That's a key point. Also, the Court used the coherence principle, linking BL40 with BL120 and BL122, which protect small house grants. So the entire SH Policy is protected, not just the free building licence part.

Another point is the "lawful" aspect. The Court said "lawful" means lawful under Hong Kong law as of 1997, not Qing law. The applicants argued it should be lawful under both, but the Court rejected that. Also, the CEDAW reservations mean that discrimination claims based on sex are excluded, which supports the policy's constitutionality.

The Court also addressed the relief issue, saying the applicants lacked standing and there was a significant delay in bringing the case, so even if the policy were unconstitutional, relief should be refused. But since they upheld the policy, the relief issue was moot.

Now, for the striking or unusual aspects. The case is about a policy that's been in place since 1972, and it's discriminatory but protected under the Basic Law. The fact that the Court relied on the CEDAW reservations to shield the policy from discrimination claims is notable. Also, the historical context of the New Territories' land tenure and the evolution of the SH Policy from colonial practices to a formal policy. The Court's rejection of the tracing exercise and their focus on the legal recognition at the time of the Basic Law's drafting is a significant legal principle. The case also highlights the tension between equality rights and traditional rights in the context of Hong Kong's constitutional framework.

Wait, I should check if there are any other unusual elements. The applicants didn't have standing because they didn't intend to build a house, which is a procedural point. The delay in challenging the policy for over 40 years is also a striking fact. The Court emphasized the prejudice to third parties and the importance of good administration, which is why they refused relief even if the policy were unconstitutional.

Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The Court of Appeal's reasoning about the "Ding Rights" being a right to have applications determined under the policy, not just a discretionary grant, is important. They cited the doctrine of legitimate expectation, so the applicants have a right to have their applications processed, which falls under "rights and interests" for BL40.

Also, the Court's interpretation of "traditional" as not requiring a direct lineage to 1898 but rather being recognized as traditional at the time of the Basic Law's drafting. That's a departure from the lower court's approach. The lower court did a historical tracing, but the Court of Appeal said that's not necessary. Instead, the focus is on whether the rights were recognized as traditional in the legal system in 1990.

Another key point is the coherence of the Basic Law. The Court read BL40 together with BL120 and BL122, which protect land leases and small house grants. So if BL40 didn't protect the SH Policy, BL120 and BL122 would be meaningless in this context. That's a strong argument for the Court's position.

The CEDAW reservations are crucial here. The UK and PRC reserved the right to apply laws that discriminate against women in the New Territories, so the SH Policy's gender discrimination is legally permissible. The Court used this to argue that the policy isn't unlawful under the BOR, which supports the "lawful" element of BL40.

Wait, the applicants argued that the policy is unlawful because it's discriminatory, but the Court said that the CEDAW reservations make it lawful, so it's protected under BL40. So the policy's discriminatory nature is excused by the international treaty reservations.

Now, putting it all together for the summary. The facts: SH Policy introduced in 1972, challenged as discriminatory, lower court split the policy, Court of Appeal upheld the entire policy under BL40. Arguments: applicants say discriminatory and not protected; respondents say protected as traditional rights. Legal principles: interpretation of BL40, rejection of tracing exercise, coherence with BL120/BL122, CEDAW reservations. Striking aspects: long-standing policy, CEDAW reservations shielding discrimination, coherence principle application.

Wait, the user asked for the ratio decidendi to be detailed and thorough. So I need to explain the Court's reasoning step by step. The key legal principles are:

1. BL40's "lawful traditional rights and interests" refers to rights recognized as traditional and lawful in the Hong Kong legal system at the time of the Basic Law's promulgation (1990), not requiring tracing back to 1898.

2. The SH Policy is such a right because it was recognized in colonial law, embedded in legislation, and never legally challenged.

3. BL40 must be read coherently with BL120 and BL122, which protect small house grants, so the entire SH Policy is protected.

4. The CEDAW reservations confirm the policy's legality despite discrimination, so it's "lawful" under BL40.

5. The applicants lacked standing and there was a significant delay, but since the policy was upheld, this was moot.

Also, the Court rejected the lower court's four-element test (lawful, traditional, etc.) in favor of a more contextual approach.

For the striking aspects, the 40+ year delay in challenging the policy, the use of CEDAW reservations to justify discrimination, the Court's emphasis on historical continuity, and the fact that the policy is a cornerstone of NTII identity despite its discriminatory nature.

Wait, the Court also clarified that "traditional" doesn't mean the right must have existed exactly as it does now, but must retain its essential features. So even though the land system changed after 1898, the right to build a small house on one's land was preserved in essence.

I need to make sure all these points are covered in the summary. Let me check the judgment again to confirm. The Court said that the Ding Rights (the right to apply for a small house) are recognized as traditional because they originated from pre-1898 customs and were continued through colonial policies. The Court rejected the lower court's tracing exercise, saying that the focus is on whether the rights were recognized as traditional at the time of the Basic Law's drafting, not whether they can be traced back to 1898.

Also, the Court emphasized that the Small House Policy was never legally challenged before, so it was considered lawful. The applicants argued that it should be unlawful under the BOR, but the CEDAW reservations mean that the discrimination isn't actionable, so the policy remains lawful.

Another point is the distinction between the forms of grants. The lower court said free building licence is protected, but private treaty and exchange aren't. The Court of Appeal said all three are protected because they're part of the same policy, and exchange is a derivative of free building licence.

Wait, the Court said that private treaty grant is traceable because it preserves the essential feature of the right to acquire land for building, which was part of the customary tenure. So even though the method of land disposal changed (from auctions to private treaty), the core right remained.

Okay, I think I have the main points. Now, structuring the answer as per the tasks.

1. Facts: Summarize the case, the policy, the challenge, the lower court's decision, and the appeal.

2. Arguments: Applicants' points (discrimination, not protected by BL40, lack of standing), Respondents' points (protected by BL40, coherence with other articles, CEDAW reservations).

3. Legal principles: Detailed explanation of BL40 interpretation, rejection of tracing exercise, coherence with BL120/BL122, CEDAW reservations, the Ding Rights as rights, and the "lawful" aspect.

4. Striking aspects: Long delay, CEDAW reservations, the policy's role in NTII identity, the Court's approach to tradition vs. historical tracing.

Wait, the user mentioned "if applicable, focus on the points that might be novel or controversial." So the novel points here are the Court's rejection of the tracing exercise, the emphasis on legal recognition at the time of the Basic Law's drafting, and the use of CEDAW reservations to shield the policy from discrimination claims. Also, the coherence principle application to link BL40 with BL120 and BL122.

I should make sure to highlight those as novel or controversial. The lower court's approach was to trace back to 1898, but the Court of Appeal said that's not required. That's a significant shift in interpretation. Also, the idea that a discriminatory policy can be protected under the Basic Law because of international reservations is a key point.

Another controversial aspect is the Court's stance that the applicants lacked standing because they didn't intend to build a house. That's a procedural point but important for the relief.

Wait, the Court also said that the Small House Policy's discriminatory nature is irrelevant because BL40 shields it from such challenges. So even though it's discriminatory, it's protected, which might be controversial in the context of equality rights.

Okay, putting it all together. Let me draft each section step by step.
</think>

### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts  
The case concerns the constitutionality of Hong Kong’s **New Territories Small House Policy (SH Policy)**, introduced in 1972. The policy grants **male indigenous villagers of the New Territories (NTIIs)** the right to apply for a small house (max. 700 sq. ft., 3 storeys) on their own land or government land, subject to eligibility criteria (e.g., descent through the male line, village residency). The policy operates in three forms: **free building licence** (on private land), **private treaty grant** (on government land at a concessionary rate), and **land exchange** (surrender of private land for government land).  

The applicants (Kwok Cheuk Kin and others), challenging the policy as discriminatory on grounds of **sex** (excludes women) and **social origin** (excludes non-NTIIs), argued it violated **Basic Law (BL) Articles 25, 39, and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights (BOR) Article 22**. The lower court (Chow J, 2019) ruled the policy was discriminatory but **constitutionally protected under BL40** (which safeguards "lawful traditional rights and interests of NTIIs") *only* for **free building licences**. Private treaty grants and land exchanges were deemed unconstitutional. The respondents (Director of Lands, etc.) and the interested party (Heung Yee Kuk, representing NTIIs) appealed, arguing the **entire SH Policy** was protected by BL40. The Court of Appeal (Poon CJ, 2021) **overturned the lower court**, holding the **entire SH Policy is constitutional** under BL40, shielding it from discrimination challenges.  

---

### 2. Summary of the Parties’ Arguments  
**Applicants’ Arguments:**  
- The SH Policy is **inherently discriminatory** on sex (only males eligible) and social origin (only NTIIs), violating BL25, BL39, and BOR22.  
- The "Ding Rights" (right to apply for a small house) are **not "rights or interests"** under BL40 because the policy is **discretionary** (government may refuse applications).  
- The policy **cannot be "traditional"** as it lacks traceability to pre-1898 customs (e.g., free building licences under the SH Policy differ from pre-colonial land practices).  
- The "lawful" element of BL40 requires compliance with **Qing law (pre-1898) and Hong Kong law (post-1997)**, which the policy violates.  
- The applicants **lacked standing** (no intention to build a house), and the **40-year delay** in challenging the policy justified dismissal.  

**Respondents’ and Interested Party’s Arguments:**  
- The SH Policy **falls squarely under BL40** as a "lawful traditional right and interest" of NTIIs.  
- The policy **originates from pre-1898 customs** (NTIIs’ right to build houses on their land), recognized and formalized by colonial authorities since 1898.  
- **"Traditional"** does not require tracing to 1898 but refers to rights **recognized as traditional at the time of the Basic Law’s drafting (1990)**.  
- **"Lawful"** means lawful under Hong Kong law as of 1997 (not Qing law), and the policy was **never legally challenged** (thus lawful).  
- The **CEDAW reservations** (by UK/PRC) explicitly permit the policy’s discriminatory nature, rendering it **lawful under international law**.  
- The **entire SH Policy** (including private treaty grants and land exchanges) is protected, as it is a **coherent continuation** of colonial land practices.  
- The applicants **lacked standing** (no direct interest in land/housing), and the **40-year delay** prejudiced third parties and good administration.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The Court of Appeal’s ratio decidendi centers on a **contextual, purposive interpretation of BL40**, rejecting the lower court’s "tracing exercise" and emphasizing **coherence with other Basic Law provisions** and **international obligations**. The key principles are:  

#### **(a) Interpretation of "Lawful Traditional Rights and Interests" under BL40**  
The Court rejected the lower court’s requirement to **trace rights back to pre-1898 customs** (e.g., via the "essential features" test). Instead, it held that **"traditional"** refers to rights **recognized as traditional in the Hong Kong legal system at the time of the Basic Law’s promulgation (April 1990)**, not those directly traceable to 1898. This aligns with the **drafting materials**, which show the Basic Law’s framers aimed to protect **"existing traditional rights and interests"** (e.g., the *Seminar Report* of 1986 listed the SH Policy as a key right). Crucially, the Court emphasized that **"traditional" does not demand historical continuity without evolution**—rights may retain their **essential features** even if modified (e.g., land tenure shifted from customary to Crown leasehold, but the right to build houses persisted).  

The Court also clarified **"lawful"** means **lawful under Hong Kong law as of 1 July 1997**, not Qing law. The applicants argued "lawful" required compliance with **both Qing law (pre-1898) and Hong Kong law (post-1997)**, but the Court rejected this, noting the Basic Law’s framers **could not have intended to subject NTII rights to Qing law** (which was irrelevant post-1997). Instead, the policy’s **lack of legal challenge since 1972** (and post-1991 BOR) confirmed its **lawfulness under Hong Kong law**.  

#### **(b) Coherence of the Basic Law: BL40, BL120, and BL122**  
The Court applied the **coherence principle**—reading the Basic Law as a **harmonious whole**—to **elevate BL40’s protection** to the entire SH Policy. **BL120** (implementing Annex III of the Sino-British Joint Declaration) guarantees **"all rights in relation to such leases"** (including small house grants) will be protected post-1997. **BL122** specifically preserves **rent concessions** for small houses granted to NTIIs. The Court held that **BL40 must be read with BL120/BL122**, as the latter **explicitly protect small house grants**. If BL40 did not cover the SH Policy, BL120/BL122 would be **rendered meaningless**—a contradiction the Court rejected. This **overturned the lower court’s narrow reading** of BL40, which had split the policy into protected (free building licence) and unprotected (private treaty grant/exchange) elements.  

#### **(c) CEDAW Reservations and Discrimination Shielding**  
The Court invoked **CEDAW reservations** (by the UK and PRC in 1996) to **exclude discrimination challenges** against the SH Policy. The reservations explicitly permit **"laws applicable in the New Territories which enable male indigenous villagers to exercise certain rights in respect of property"** (e.g., the SH Policy). The Court held that **CEDAW reservations are a "weighty aid"** to interpreting the Basic Law, confirming the policy’s **lawfulness despite its sex discrimination**. This meant the **BOR’s equality provisions (e.g., BOR22) could not invalidate the policy**, as the reservations **preemptively shielded it**. The Court further reasoned that **BL40’s purpose**—protecting NTII rights—**overrides equality challenges**, as the Basic Law’s framers **intentionally preserved discriminatory rights** (e.g., the *Seminar Report* cited "special circumstances of New Territories" as justification).  

#### **(d) The "Ding Rights" as "Rights and Interests" under BL40**  
The applicants argued the SH Policy is **discretionary** (government may refuse applications), so the "Ding Rights" (right to apply) are **not "rights"** under BL40. The Court rejected this, citing **legitimate expectation** (from *Ng Siu Tung v Director of Immigration*): a government policy creates **legal obligations** to process applications fairly. Thus, the **right to have an application determined** under the SH Policy qualifies as a **"right or interest"** under BL40. The Court also noted the policy’s **statutory recognition** (e.g., *Buildings Ordinance (Application to the New Territories) Ordinance*), confirming its **legal enforceability**.  

#### **(e) Rejection of the Lower Court’s Tracing Exercise**  
The lower court required **historical tracing** to prove the SH Policy’s "traditionality" (e.g., whether free building licences mirrored pre-1898 customs). The Court of Appeal **rejected this as unnecessary**, stating the **drafting materials** show the framers focused on **"existing rights"** (not pre-1898 origins). The Court further held that **private treaty grants and land exchanges** are **traceable** because they **preserve the essential feature** of NTIIs’ right to acquire land for building (e.g., concessionary rates, village-exclusive sales). For example:  
- **Pre-1909**: Land sold via **public auction** at concessionary rates (villagers paid low premiums).  
- **1909–1940s**: **Private treaty grants** (same concessionary rates, for "bona fide" villagers).  
- **1950s–1972**: **Restricted village auctions** (effectively private treaty grants).  
- **1972 onward**: **SH Policy** (formalizing private treaty grants).  
The **concessionary rate** (2/3 market value) **consistently preserved** the core right, proving **continuity**. Thus, **all three grant forms** are protected.  

#### **(f) Relief and Standing**  
The Court dismissed the applicants’ claim on **lack of standing** (no intention to build a house, no land interest) and **procedural delay** (40+ years since the SH Policy’s inception). It emphasized that **good administration** and **prejudice to third parties** (e.g., 111,995 applications processed since 1972) **override the applicants’ claims**.  

---

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects  
1. **The Policy’s 50-Year Legal Immunity**: The SH Policy operated **uncontested for 49 years** (1972–2021), despite its **explicit sex discrimination** (excluding women). The Court’s ruling confirms that **discriminatory policies can be constitutionally protected** if framed as "traditional rights," a stark contrast to global equality norms.  

2. **CEDAW Reservations as a Constitutional Shield**: The Court’s reliance on **UK/PRC CEDAW reservations** to **legally justify sex discrimination** is unprecedented. The reservations explicitly permit the SH Policy’s gender bias, making it **immune to BOR22 challenges**. This highlights how **international treaties can override domestic equality laws** in Hong Kong’s constitutional framework.  

3. **Rejection of Historical Tracing**: The Court **rejected the lower court’s meticulous historical analysis** (e.g., tracing land tenure to 1898), instead focusing on **legal recognition at the time of the Basic Law’s drafting (1990)**. This **shifts the burden from historical proof to legal continuity**, a novel approach to interpreting "traditional rights."  

4. **The "Ding Rights" as a Constitutional Right**: The Court elevated the **discretionary right to apply** for a small house into a **protected "right" under BL40**, grounding it in **legitimate expectation**. This expands the scope of "rights and interests" beyond formal entitlements to **administrative processes**.  

5. **The Court’s Coherence Principle**: The ruling **links BL40 to BL120/BL122** to **avoid rendering the latter meaningless**—a bold application of constitutional coherence. This demonstrates how Hong Kong courts **prioritize systemic harmony over textual literalism**.  

6. **The 40-Year Delay as a Dispositive Factor**: The Court **refused relief solely due to procedural delay**, emphasizing **administrative stability** over individual rights. This underscores the **pragmatic, non-ideological** approach of Hong Kong courts in constitutional matters.  

7. **The Policy’s Role in NTII Identity**: The SH Policy is **central to NTII cultural identity** (e.g., "Ding Rights" are a symbol of lineage and village belonging). The Court’s ruling **prioritizes cultural continuity over equality**, reflecting Hong Kong’s unique post-colonial constitutional balance.  

**Conclusion**: This case is remarkable for **legally entrenching a discriminatory policy** under the guise of "tradition," **leveraging international treaties** to shield it from equality challenges, and **redefining "tradition"** to prioritize **legal recognition over historical lineage**. It reveals the **tension between universal equality norms and localized cultural rights** in Hong Kong’s constitutional order—a tension the Court resolved in favor of tradition. [end of text]
