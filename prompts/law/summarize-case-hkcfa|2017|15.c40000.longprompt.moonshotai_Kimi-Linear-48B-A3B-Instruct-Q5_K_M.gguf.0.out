### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts

The case involves two appellants, Stephen Chan Chi Wan ("Chan") and Tseng Pei Kun ("Tseng"), who were charged under Section 9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (Cap. 201, "POBO") with conspiracy to accept an advantage and substantive offences of accepting an advantage and offering an advantage. The facts are as follows:

- **Chan** was the General Manager (Broadcasting) of Television Broadcasts Ltd ("TVB") and hosted a popular talk show called "Be My Guest" ("志雲飯局"). He was not contractually required to host the show but did so voluntarily, gaining celebrity status.
- **Olympian City** ("OC") is a shopping mall that collaborated with TVB for a New Year's Eve Countdown show. In 2009, OC agreed to pay TVB $1.3 million as a sponsorship fee for the event.
- **OC** independently invited Chan to appear in a live, staged edition of "Be My Guest" as part of the Countdown show, interviewing a celebrity guest, Lai Yiu Cheung ("Lai"). OC paid IEAP (a company associated with Chan) $160,000, which IEAP then paid Chan $112,000 and Lai $20,000, keeping $28,000 for itself.
- Chan did not seek TVB's permission for this outside engagement, violating his employment contract. However, TVB was aware of his participation, as the show was broadcast on TVB and involved its production.
- **Tseng** was the sole director of IEAP and acted as Chan's agent for external engagements. He facilitated the payment from OC to Chan.
- The prosecution charged Chan and Tseng with conspiracy to accept an advantage (Charge 1) and substantive offences (Charges 2 and 3). The trial judge acquitted them, but the Court of Appeal reversed the acquittal, convicting them and imposing fines. The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) granted leave to appeal, certifying questions on the interpretation of Section 9 of POBO and the defence of reasonable excuse.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**Prosecution's Arguments:**
- The prosecution argued that Chan's appearance on the "Be My Guest" segment was an act "in relation to TVB's affairs or business" under Section 9(1)(a) of POBO. They contended that even if TVB did not explicitly authorize the appearance, Chan's role as a TVB employee and the show's broadcast on TVB made the act related to TVB's business.
- They further argued that the payment from OC to Chan was an inducement for Chan to perform, which was an act in relation to TVB's business, thus satisfying the "in relation to" requirement.
- The prosecution also contended that the defence of reasonable excuse was not available because Chan failed to obtain TVB's permission, and his belief that TVB would consent was unreasonable.

**Appellants' Arguments:**
- **Chan** argued that his appearance on the show was purely as a celebrity, not in his capacity as TVB's General Manager (Broadcasting), and thus unrelated to TVB's business. He claimed that the act was personal and not aimed at influencing TVB's affairs.
- **Tseng** argued that he did not know the payment was intended as a bribe and that there was no evidence of corrupt intent. He also argued that the payment was not an advantage "in relation to TVB's business" because Chan's performance was not directed by TVB.
- Both appellants relied on the defence of reasonable excuse, arguing that they had a reasonable belief that TVB would consent to Chan's appearance and payment, especially since TVB was aware of the arrangement.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) addressed several key legal principles in this case:

#### A. Interpretation of "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" (Section 9(1)(a))
- The CFA clarified that the phrase "in relation to his principal's affairs or business" requires the agent's act to be **"aimed at" and intended to influence or affect the principal's affairs or business**. This is a restrictive interpretation, not merely that the act is "related" to the principal's business in a broad sense.
- The CFA distinguished this from the English Court of Appeal's approach in *Fung Hok Cheung*, where the act must have a **potential adverse impact** on the principal's interests. Instead, the CFA emphasized that the act must undermine the integrity of the agency relationship by injuring the bond of trust and loyalty.
- The CFA rejected the Court of Appeal's reasoning that any act beneficial to the principal (e.g., boosting ratings) could satisfy the "in relation to" requirement. It held that such conduct, even if beneficial, does not constitute an act "in relation to" the principal's business unless it is intended to influence or affect the principal's affairs.

#### B. Mens Rea Requirements
- The CFA reiterated that Section 9 requires proof of **mens rea** for all essential actus reus elements. For the agent's acceptance of an advantage, the prosecution must prove that the agent **knew or believed** the advantage was provided as an inducement or reward for an act aimed at the principal's business.
- For the offeror, the prosecution must prove that the person offering the advantage intended it to be accepted as an inducement or reward for the agent's act aimed at the principal's business.

#### C. Reasonable Excuse Defence
- The CFA clarified that the defence of reasonable excuse under Section 24 requires the accused to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that their conduct was reasonable in the circumstances. The defence is not available if the conduct does not prima facie constitute an offence under Section 9.
- The CFA emphasized that the defence is not available if the act is not "in relation to the principal's affairs or business" (i.e., if the act does not meet the restrictive interpretation above). However, if the act is within the scope of Section 9, the defence may still be available if the agent had a reasonable belief that the principal would consent.

#### D. Conspiracy and Section 24
- The CFA held that Section 24 (which places the burden of proving reasonable excuse on the accused) does not apply to conspiracy charges under the common law or the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 32). Conspiracy is an inchoate offence tried under common law principles, which do not impose a reverse onus. The prosecution must prove the absence of reasonable excuse as part of the actus reus.

#### E. The Mischief of Section 9
- The CFA emphasized that Section 9 targets **corrupt transactions** that undermine the integrity of the agency relationship. It is not intended to criminalize conduct that is merely "related" to the principal's business or beneficial to the principal. The focus is on conduct that is **detrimental to the principal's interests** or that subverts the trust and loyalty inherent in the agency relationship.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case

1. **Celebrity Moonlighting and Corporate Sponsorship**: The case involved a high-profile TVB host, Chan, who moonlighted as a celebrity for a shopping mall's New Year event. The payment was arranged through his agent, and TVB was aware of the arrangement. This highlights the tension between an employee's personal brand and their employer's interests.
2. **Broad Interpretation of "in relation to"**: The Court of Appeal's initial broad interpretation of "in relation to" (arguing that any act related to the principal's business, even if beneficial, suffices) was widely criticized as undermining the restrictive intent of Section 9. The CFA's narrow interpretation aligns with the principle that corruption requires a **detrimental impact** on the principal's interests.
3. **Reasonable Excuse and Informed Consent**: The CFA's emphasis on the need for the agent to have a **reasonable belief** that the principal would consent (even if the principal did not explicitly consent) is notable. This reflects a pragmatic approach to corruption prevention, balancing strict liability with fairness.
4. **Reverse Onus in Conspiracy**: The CFA's refusal to apply Section 24 (reverse onus) to conspiracy charges is significant. It upholds the common law principle that conspiracy requires proof of intent and purpose, without shifting the burden of proof to the accused.
5. **Public vs. Private Sector Bribery**: The case underscores the distinction between public sector bribery (under Section 4) and private sector bribery (under Section 9). The CFA's narrow interpretation of Section 9 ensures that private sector agents are not over-criminalized for conduct that is merely "related" to their principal's business.

### Final Outcome
The Court of Final Appeal unanimously allowed the appeals, quashing the convictions of Chan and Tseng. The CFA held that Chan's appearance on the "Be My Guest" segment was not an act "in relation to TVB's affairs or business" under Section 9, and thus no offence was committed. The defence of reasonable excuse was also available, as Chan had a reasonable belief that TVB would consent to his participation and payment. The case reaffirms the need for a **detrimental impact** on the principal's interests for an act to fall under Section 9 and clarifies the limited scope of the reverse onus provision in conspiracy cases.
