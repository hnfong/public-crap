Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to understand the bill thoroughly. The bill is called the Protection of Critical Infrastructures (Computer Systems) Bill. From the content, it seems to be about regulating computer systems in critical infrastructure to protect them from security threats and incidents.

Starting with Question A: Summary, purpose, and major themes. The bill's purpose is to protect the computer systems of Hong Kong's critical infrastructures, regulate their operators, and provide for investigations and responses to security threats and incidents. The major themes would be the designation of critical infrastructures and operators, mandatory security measures, compliance requirements, and the establishment of regulatory bodies and procedures for handling security issues.

For Question B: Who is impacted? The bill affects CI operators, designated authorities, the Commissioner, and the public. Those who need to be familiar are the operators, authorities, and possibly the public for understanding the regulations. Concerned parties would be those who operate critical infrastructure, as they have obligations, and the authorities responsible for oversight. Also, the public might be concerned about the security of critical services.

Question C: New obligations. The bill imposes obligations on CI operators to maintain an office in Hong Kong, notify changes, set up a security management unit, submit and implement security plans, conduct risk assessments, and perform audits. It also requires them to report security incidents. New rights/powers include the Commissioner and designated authorities having the power to direct directions, issue codes of practice, and conduct investigations. They can also issue warrants for entering premises or accessing electronic devices.

Question D: Liabilities. There are both civil and criminal penalties. For example, failure to comply with directions can lead to fines. Notifying incidents on time is required, and failure to do so is an offense. There are also penalties for not providing information as required. The bill also includes provisions for the preservation of secrecy, so unauthorized disclosure could lead to penalties. The appeal process might involve certain liabilities if the appeal is dismissed. Also, the use of incriminating evidence in proceedings is regulated, and failure to comply with that could be an offense. The bill mentions specific fines for different sections, like $3 million for summary conviction, $5 million for indictment, etc. There are also conditions like not having a reasonable excuse, or not following the specified timeframes for notifications or compliance.
