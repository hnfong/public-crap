### 1. Summary of Facts

The case involved four respondents: three primary school teachers from the Church of Christ in China Heep Woh Primary School and a friend of one of them. In June 2014, the school was conducting competitive admission interviews for new students. The teachers were briefed on the interview questions and marking schemes, which were provided in confidential plastic folders.

Before the interviews took place, the first three respondents used their personal mobile phones to photograph the contents of the briefing folders. They then transmitted these photographs via WhatsApp to third parties, including friends and other teachers. The third respondent also used a school desktop computer to type the questions into a Word document, which she then emailed to the second respondent and a friend. The second and fourth respondents further distributed these questions to others.

The respondents were charged under section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200), which makes it an offence to "obtain access to a computer with a view to dishonest gain for himself or another." The charges specifically alleged that each respondent obtained access to a computer (their own smartphones or the school desktop) for this purpose.

The Magistrate acquitted all four respondents. She found that there was reasonable doubt regarding whether the respondents knew the questions were confidential and whether they possessed the requisite mens rea (dishonest intent). The Secretary for Justice appealed, arguing that the acquittal was erroneous in law. The Court of First Instance (CFI) upheld the acquittal, primarily on the ground that the actus reus of the offence did not cover the use of one's own computer. The Secretary for Justice then appealed to the Court of Final Appeal (CFA).

### 2. Summary of Arguments

**The Appellant (Secretary for Justice):**
*   **Broad Interpretation:** The appellant argued that the phrase "obtains access to a computer" in section 161(1)(c) should be interpreted broadly to include the use of *any* computer, including one's own device.
*   **Legislative Intent:** Citing the Second Reading Speech, the appellant argued that the legislation was intended to cover access "irrespective of whether the access was authorized or not" and "irrespective of the means of access."
*   **Public Policy:** The appellant contended that a narrow interpretation would create a significant legal lacuna, allowing individuals to commit computer-related crimes (such as fraud, stalking, or leaking confidential data) using their own devices with impunity. They argued that the purpose of the law was to proscribe computer misuse generally, and technology had evolved since 1993 to include smartphones and social media, which should fall within the scope.
*   **Precedent:** They relied on previous cases where s 161 was applied to various forms of computer misuse, suggesting the provision was meant to be a catch-all for dishonest computer use.

**The Respondents (The Teachers):**
*   **Ordinary Meaning:** The respondents argued that the ordinary meaning of "obtain access" implies gaining entry to something to which one did not previously have access. One cannot "obtain" access to a computer they already own and control.
*   **Statutory Context:** They pointed out that other provisions in the Computer Crimes Ordinance 1993 (such as s 27A of the Telecommunications Ordinance) explicitly used the term "unauthorized access," whereas s 161 did not. However, the use of "obtain" and "access" in s 161, combined with the legislative history, suggested the offence was aimed at accessing *another's* computer.
*   **Legislative History:** They highlighted that the original draft of the Bill included a definition of "access" that would have covered causing a computer to perform any function (which could include one's own), but this definition was deliberately deleted during the legislative process.
*   **Purpose of the Offence:** The respondents argued that the offence was designed as a preparatory offence to catch those who accessed computers to commit future crimes (like fraud or theft), not to punish the mere use of one's own device for dishonest purposes, which might be covered by other laws (e.g., theft, fraud, or breach of confidence).

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) dismissed the appeal, establishing a crucial limitation on the scope of section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance. The core legal principle is that the offence of "obtaining access to a computer with a view to dishonest gain" does **not** apply to a person using their own computer, unless that use involves accessing a computer belonging to another person.

**Statutory Construction and Ordinary Meaning**
The Court began its analysis by applying standard principles of statutory construction: looking at the text, context, and purpose of the provision. The Court focused heavily on the specific wording "obtains access." The Court noted that the verb "obtain" means to "come into the possession or enjoyment of" or "acquire." Logically, one cannot "acquire" or "obtain" access to a computer that one already possesses and controls. Similarly, the word "access" implies admittance to something previously unavailable. Therefore, the ordinary linguistic meaning of the phrase "obtains access to a computer" strongly suggests a scenario where the actor gains entry to a computer system they did not previously have access to, i.e., a computer belonging to someone else.

**Legislative History and Intent**
The Court examined the legislative history of the Computer Crimes Ordinance 1993. It was revealed that the original Bill contained a proposed interpretive provision stating that a person "obtains access to a computer if (and only if) he causes a computer to perform any function." This definition was broad enough to potentially cover the use of one's own computer. However, the Court noted that this specific definition was **deliberately deleted** during the Second Reading Debate in the Legislative Council. The deletion was done at the suggestion of a Subcommittee concerned that the broad definition might be too limiting in other contexts (specifically regarding data in transit), but its removal indicated a legislative choice *not* to adopt a definition that would clearly encompass the use of one's own computer.

Furthermore, the Court looked at the Memorandum for the Legislative Council and the Second Reading Speech. While the Secretary for Security stated the offence would apply "irrespective of whether the access was authorized," the Court interpreted this in the context of the overall purpose. The stated purpose was to create a new offence of "dishonest accessing" to punish preparatory acts where the access itself was not yet an offence. The Court reasoned that the policy rationale was to target the *wrongful* use of *another's* computer as a precursor to fraud or other crimes. The difficulty of proving the *mens rea* (dishonest intent) for a preparatory offence is significantly reduced when the actus reus involves the wrongful intrusion into another's property (the computer).

**Distinction from Other Offences**
The Court distinguished section 161 from other provisions in the 1993 Ordinance, such as section 27A of the Telecommunications Ordinance, which explicitly criminalized "unauthorized access." The absence of the word "unauthorized" in section 161 did not, in the Court's view, expand the scope to include one's own computer. Instead, the Court held that the words "obtain" and "access" inherently carried the connotation of unauthorized access to a system one does not control. The Court rejected the appellant's argument that the lack of the word "unauthorized" was a drafting oversight intended to broaden the scope.

**Rejection of Policy-Based Construction**
The appellant argued that a narrow interpretation would create a "legal lacuna" allowing criminals to use their own devices to commit fraud, stalking, or data leaks without falling under s 161. The Court firmly rejected this argument. It emphasized that the function of the Court is to ascertain the *actual* purpose of the statute as enacted, not to identify a *desirable* purpose and then construe the law to fit it. The Court held that if the legislature intended to criminalize the use of one's own computer for dishonest gain, they could have done so explicitly. The existence of other laws (such as theft, fraud, or breach of confidence) meant that such conduct was not necessarily left unpunished, just not under *this specific* provision.

**Conclusion on the Actus Reus**
Ultimately, the Court held that the *actus reus* of section 161(1)(c) is restricted to the unauthorized extraction and use of information from a computer, or more broadly, the act of obtaining access to a computer that does not belong to the offender. Since the respondents in this case used their own smartphones (and the third respondent's use of the school computer was conceded to be effectively her own for the purpose of the appeal), they did not "obtain access" to a computer in the legal sense required by the statute. Consequently, the appeal was dismissed, and the acquittals stood.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

**The "Own Computer" Loophole:**
The most striking aspect of this case is the creation of a specific "loophole" in Hong Kong's computer crime legislation. It establishes that if a person uses their *own* smartphone or laptop to steal data, leak confidential information, or commit fraud, they cannot be charged under section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance, even if the intent is clearly dishonest. This seems counter-intuitive in an era where personal devices are the primary tools for crime. The law effectively creates a distinction where stealing data from a school server using a personal phone is a crime, but stealing data from a school server using a school computer (if the user has "access" rights) might not be, or using one's own phone to steal data from a friend's cloud account might not fall under this specific charge.

**The Impact of a Deleted Clause:**
The case is remarkable for how a single deleted clause in the legislative history became the pivot point for the entire judgment. The Court placed immense weight on the fact that the original Bill included a definition ("causes a computer to perform any function") that would have covered the use of one's own computer, but the legislature chose to remove it. This highlights the power of legislative drafting history in statutory interpretation; the Court inferred that the removal was a deliberate choice to limit the scope of the offence, rather than an oversight.

**The "Preparatory" Nature of the Offence:**
The judgment reinforces the idea that section 161 is a "preparatory" offence. It is designed to catch people *before* they commit the substantive crime (like fraud or theft) by accessing a computer. The Court reasoned that the "wrongfulness" of the actus reus is tied to the intrusion into another's property. This is a nuanced legal distinction that separates "hacking" (accessing another's system) from "misuse" (using one's own system dishonestly).

**The Concession on the School Computer:**
It is somewhat unusual that the third respondent, who used a school computer, was treated the same as those using personal phones. The Court accepted the prosecution's concession that because there was no evidence limiting her authority to use the school computer for private purposes, it could be treated as "her own" for the purpose of the legal test. This concession simplified the case but also highlights the complexity of determining "ownership" and "authority" in the digital age, where employees often have broad access to employer systems.

**The "Real Case List" Rejection:**
The Court's dismissal of the "real case list" of crimes that would go unpunished is a strong statement on the separation of powers. The Secretary for Justice presented a list of serious crimes (hacking, phishing, DDoS attacks) that would seemingly be impossible to prosecute under s 161 if the narrow interpretation were adopted. The Court's response—that it is not the Court's job to fix legislative gaps by stretching the law—is a fundamental principle of the rule of law, even if it leaves a perceived gap in criminal justice. It forces the legislature to act if they wish to close the gap, rather than the judiciary to expand the law. [end of text]
