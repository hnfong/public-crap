Got it, let's tackle this case step by step. First, I need to answer the four tasks: facts, parties' arguments, legal principles, and anything striking. Let's start with facts.

**Facts Summary**: The appellant, Chan Ming Lok, was convicted of possessing an offensive weapon (a knife) in a public place in Hong Kong under section 33(1) of the Public Order Ordinance (POO), Cap. 245. The key facts: On June 29, 2008, around 1:45 a.m., police officers observed Chan walking in Central, acting suspiciously (looking around, changing rucksack shoulder, slow pace). He was stopped outside Cochrane Street, and a knife was found in his rucksack. Chan admitted carrying the knife for self-defense—he lived in Shenzhen, worked as a chef, and claimed he was afraid of robbery due to bad public order there. He said he’d brought it through Customs before and didn’t know it was illegal. The magistrate convicted him, finding the knife was an offensive weapon and he had no lawful excuse. He appealed conviction and sentence; the court dismissed the conviction appeal but reduced the sentence from 6 months to 4 months.

**Parties' Arguments**: 
- **Appellant (Chan)**: Argued the magistrate wrongly classified the knife as an offensive weapon under category (c) of POO section 2 ("suitable for causing injury to the person"), which he claimed was invalidated by the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (HK BRO) per an obiter comment in *R v. Chong Ah Choi* (1994). He also argued his intent was only self-defense (not to injure in HK), so it didn’t fall under category (d) (intended for use to cause injury).
- **Respondent (HKSAR)**: Conceded category (c) was invalid under HK BRO (so only categories (a), (b), (d) apply) but argued the magistrate still correctly found the knife fell under category (d): Chan admitted intending to use it against others (self-defense, even in Shenzhen), which counts as "intended for use to cause injury" regardless of location. They also defended the 6-month sentence as appropriate.

**Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**: Let's break this down, focusing on novel/controversial points.

1. **Interpretation of "Offensive Weapon" Under POO Section 2**: 
   - Section 2 of POO defines "offensive weapons" in four categories, but the court confirmed that category (c) ("suitable for causing injury to the person") is invalid due to the HK BRO. This was based on *Chong Ah Choi* (obiter) suggesting category (c) might violate rights, and the Secretary of Justice conceded it no longer applies. Thus, only categories (a) (made for injury), (b) (adapted for injury), and (d) (intended by possessor for injury) are valid.
   - **Key Novelty**: The court explicitly held that category (c) is a "trap for the unwary" and not legally enforceable, even though the POO hasn’t been amended since 1994. This clarifies that mere "suitability" for injury isn’t enough—there must be evidence of manufacture, adaptation, or intent to use for injury.

2. **Category (d): "Intended for Use to Cause Injury"**: 
   - The court clarified that "intended use" under category (d) includes self-defense. Chan admitted carrying the knife to protect himself from robbery (even in Shenzhen), which the court found constituted "intending to cause injury" because self-defense still involves the potential to harm others. The location (Shenzhen vs. HK) was irrelevant—intent to use against another person, even for defense, satisfies category (d).
   - **Importance**: This rejects the appellant’s argument that self-defense intent (limited to Mainland) negated category (d). The court emphasized that the possessor’s intent to use the weapon against someone (regardless of justification) triggers category (d), unless there’s a lawful excuse (like imminent danger, which wasn’t present here).

3. **Lawful Excuse for Possession**: 
   - Self-defense alone isn’t a reasonable excuse under section 33(1) unless there’s "imminent danger." Chan claimed fear of robbery in Shenzhen, but there was no evidence of immediate threat on the night in HK. The court reaffirmed that mere fear of future harm (not imminent) doesn’t justify possession of an offensive weapon.

4. **Appellate Review Standard**: 
   - On appeal, even if the magistrate’s reasoning was unclear (e.g., didn’t explicitly state which category applied), the court upheld the conviction because the evidence supported category (d). The appellant’s admission of intending to use the knife for self-defense (against others) was credible, and the magistrate’s findings on witness credibility (police officers were honest; Chan’s admissions were voluntary) were upheld.

5. **Sentencing Considerations for Possession of Offensive Weapons**: 
   - While the court acknowledged the seriousness of carrying offensive weapons (to maintain public safety), it reduced the sentence from 6 months to 4 months because: (1) the knife was a "relatively small domestic knife"; (2) Chan had no prior convictions; (3) there was no evidence linking his movements to criminal activity (he’d just finished work as a chef); (4) his intent might have been defensive rather than offensive. The court stressed that mandatory minimums (here, up to 3 years) allow judicial discretion to consider mitigating factors.

**Striking/Unusual Points**:
- **14-Year Delay in Amending POO**: The court noted that despite the *Chong Ah Choi* obiter (1994) suggesting category (c) was unconstitutional, the POO still includes category (c) in 2009. The judge called this a "trap for the unwary," as unwary defendants (or magistrates) might rely on the outdated full text without knowing category (c) is invalid.
- **Self-Defense as Category (d) Trigger**: The court’s holding that even self-defense intent (to harm others if necessary) falls under category (d) is notable. It clarifies that the "intent" element doesn’t require malicious intent—any intent to use the weapon against another person (even for defense) suffices, unless there’s imminent danger.
- **Credibility of Admissions**: The court heavily relied on Chan’s voluntary admissions ("he carried the knife for self-defense against robbers") as proof of category (d) intent, even though he claimed it was only for the Mainland. This shows that the *purpose* of possession (even if defensive) is what matters, not the specific jurisdiction where the harm might occur.
- **Sentence Reduction Despite Conviction**: The court reduced the sentence from 6 months to 4 months, emphasizing that while the offense is serious, mitigating factors (first offense, small knife, defensive intent, no criminal behavior) justify leniency. This balances deterrence with individual circumstances.</seed:think>### 1. Brief Summary of Facts  
The appellant, Chan Ming Lok, was convicted of possessing an offensive weapon (a knife) in a public place in Hong Kong under **section 33(1) of the Public Order Ordinance (POO), Cap. 245**. On the night of 29 June 2008 (~1:45 a.m.), police officers observed Chan acting suspiciously in Central: he walked slowly, looked around frequently, and adjusted his rucksack (slinging it to his right shoulder). When stopped outside Nos. 9–11 Cochrane Street, a knife was found in his rucksack. Chan admitted carrying the knife for **self-defense**: he lived in Shenzhen, worked as a chef, and claimed he feared robbery due to "bad public order" there. He also stated he had brought the knife through Customs multiple times and was unaware it was illegal in Hong Kong. The magistrate convicted him, finding the knife was an offensive weapon and he lacked a lawful excuse. Chan appealed both the conviction and 6-month sentence; the court dismissed the conviction appeal but reduced the sentence to 4 months.  


### 2. Arguments of the Two Parties  
- **Appellant (Chan Ming Lok)**:  
  - Challenged the magistrate’s classification of the knife as an offensive weapon, arguing the third category of the POO’s definition—"articles suitable for causing injury to the person" (category (c))—was invalid under the **Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (HK BRO)**. This relied on an obiter comment in *R v. Chong Ah Choi* (1994) suggesting category (c) might violate constitutional rights.  
  - Contended his intent was purely self-defense (not to injure others in Hong Kong), so the knife did not fall under the fourth category—"intended by the possessor for use to cause injury" (category (d)).  

- **Respondent (HKSAR)**:  
  - **Conceded category (c) was invalid** under the HK BRO (thus only categories (a), (b), (d) apply) but argued the magistrate correctly found the knife fell under **category (d)**. Chan’s admissions—that he carried the knife to defend against robbers (even in Shenzhen)—proved he intended to use it against others, satisfying category (d).  
  - Defended the 6-month sentence as appropriate, emphasizing the seriousness of carrying offensive weapons in public.  


### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The case clarifies critical interpretive and substantive rules around offensive weapon possession, with a focus on statutory construction and human rights compliance:  

#### a. Invalidity of Category (c) Under the HK BRO  
Section 2 of the POO defines "offensive weapons" in four categories, but the court **explicitly held category (c)—"articles suitable for causing injury to the person"—is unenforceable** due to the HK BRO. This followed an obiter statement in *Chong Ah Choi* (1994) that category (c) risked violating rights by criminalizing mere possession of commonly useful items (e.g., knives) based on abstract "suitability," not actual intent or adaptation. The Secretary of Justice conceded this, and the court noted the POO’s failure to amend category (c) in 14 years made it a "trap for the unwary."  

#### b. Category (d): "Intended for Use to Cause Injury" Includes Self-Defense  
The court rejected Chan’s argument that self-defense intent negated category (d). It held that **any intent to use a weapon against another person—even for self-defense—satisfies category (d)**, unless there is "imminent danger" (which justified lawful excuse). Chan’s admission that he carried the knife to protect himself from robbery (even in Shenzhen) proved he intended to use it against others, triggering category (d). The court emphasized *intent to harm others* (not maliciousness) is the key—defensive intent still involves the potential to cause injury, which falls within the statute’s scope.  

#### c. Lawful Excuse Requires Imminent Danger  
Self-defense alone is not a "reasonable excuse" under section 33(1). The court reaffirmed that mere fear of future harm (e.g., "bad public order in Shenzhen") is insufficient; there must be **imminent danger** to justify possession. Chan offered no evidence of immediate threat on the night in Hong Kong, so his self-defense claim failed.  

#### d. Appellate Review: Credibility of Admissions Trumps Procedural Ambiguity  
The magistrate’s reasoning was criticized for ambiguity (she did not explicitly state which category applied), but the court upheld the conviction. This was because Chan’s **voluntary admissions** (e.g., "I carried the knife to defend against robbers") were credible, and the police witnesses were found trustworthy. The court held that even if the magistrate’s rationale was unclear, the evidence supported a category (d) conviction.  

#### e. Sentencing Discretion for Mitigating Factors  
While the court stressed the "seriousness of carrying offensive weapons" (to preserve public safety), it reduced the sentence from 6 months to 4 months due to mitigating factors:  
  - The knife was a "relatively small domestic knife";  
  - Chan had no prior convictions;  
  - There was no evidence linking his movements to criminal activity (he had just finished work as a chef);  
  - His intent may have been defensive, not offensive.  
This balanced deterrence with individual circumstances, confirming judicial discretion to deviate from harsher sentences where warranted.  


### 4. Striking/Unusual Aspects  
- **14-Year Delay in Statutory Amendment**: The court lambasted the government for failing to amend the POO’s category (c) since *Chong Ah Choi* (1994), calling it a "trap for the unwary." This left defendants and magistrates vulnerable to relying on an outdated, unconstitutional provision.  
- **Self-Defense as a Category (d) Trigger**: The ruling that even defensive intent (to harm others if necessary) satisfies category (d) is notable. It clarifies that the statute targets *possession for potential use against others*, not just malicious intent—rejecting the notion that self-defense "purifies" otherwise illegal possession.  
- **Credibility of Voluntary Admissions**: The court’s heavy reliance on Chan’s own words (e.g., "I carried it for self-defense") to prove intent, despite his claim it was only for the Mainland, highlights that **jurisdiction of intended use is irrelevant**—what matters is the possessor’s intent to use the weapon against another person, anywhere.  
- **Lenient Sentence for First-Time Offenders**: The reduction from 6 to 4 months reflects a pragmatic approach to sentencing, prioritizing rehabilitation over punishment for first-time offenders with minimal criminality. [end of text]
