Okay, I need to help the user understand this big tax bill by summarizing each section starting from Sec. 70001. Let me start by reading through the provided sections carefully. 

First, Sec. 70001 is about references to the Internal Revenue Code. The user wants specifics, so I should note that it amends how sections are referenced, making them permanent instead of temporary. The key points are the amendments to section references and the exclusion of certain rate changes. 

Moving to Sec. 70101, it's about extending and enhancing reduced tax rates. The user needs to know the rates are made permanent by removing expiration dates. The inflation adjustments are also modified here. 

Sec. 70102 deals with the standard deduction. The amounts are increased to $23,625 and $15,750, and the expiration date is removed. I should mention the specific numbers and the phaseout based on income. 

Sec. 70103 terminates the personal exemption deduction except for a senior deduction. The senior deduction has a $6,000 amount with income limits and requires a Social Security number. Important to note the phaseout and the SSN requirement. 

Sec. 70104 extends the child tax credit to $2,200 with inflation adjustments. The SSN requirement is again emphasized, and the refundable part is specified. 

Sec. 70105 increases the qualified business income deduction thresholds to $75k and $150k, with a minimum $400 deduction. The inflation adjustment here is based on 2025. 

Sec. 70106 raises estate and gift tax exemptions to $15 million, indexed after 2026. Applies to deaths and gifts after 2025. 

Sec. 70107 modifies the AMT exemption amounts and phaseouts. The phaseout percentage increases to 50%, effective post-2025. 

Sec. 70108 extends the mortgage interest deduction limit, removing the 2025 expiration. Also, mortgage insurance premiums are excluded. 

Sec. 70109 allows casualty loss deductions for state-declared disasters, with specific disaster definitions. 

Sec. 70110 terminates miscellaneous deductions except educator expenses. Educator expenses are now itemized deductions. 

Sec. 70111 limits the tax benefit of itemized deductions to 2/37 of income over certain thresholds. 

Sec. 70112 extends transportation fringe benefits, removing some subsections and adjusting inflation. 

Sec. 70113 extends moving expense rules, allowing deductions for intelligence community members. 

Sec. 70114 modifies wagering loss deductions to 90% of gains, with income limits. 

Sec. 70115 increases ABLE account contributions to $16,000 with inflation. 

Sec. 70116 enhances the Saver’s Credit for ABLE contributions up to $2,100. 

Sec. 70117 allows rolling over 529 funds into ABLE accounts permanently. 

Sec. 70118 extends tax benefits for service in Sinai and adds Kenya, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Chad. 

Sec. 70119 excludes student loan discharges due to death/disability from income, requiring SSN. 

Sec. 70120 limits state and local tax deductions to $40k initially, phasedown to $10k by 2030 based on income. 

Now, I need to ensure each summary is concise, under four sentences, with specific numbers and parties. Avoid vagueness. Check each section again to confirm details. For example, in Sec. 70102, the standard deduction increases to $23,625 and $15,750, and the phaseout starts at $150k. 

Make sure each section is addressed in order, starting from 70001. Use clear, direct language. Avoid technical jargon where possible but keep specifics. Ensure all significant details like dollar amounts, effective dates, and key entities (like IRS, states) are included. 

Double-check for any missed sections or misinterpretations. For instance, Sec. 70110's educator expenses are now part of itemized deductions under 63(b). Also, Sec. 70120's SALT limit phases down over years. 

Alright, time to structure each section's summary as per the user's instructions.
