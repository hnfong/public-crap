Hmm, the user has shared a large legislative bill and wants me to summarize every section starting from Sec. 10101. This appears to be a major agricultural bill championed by former President Trump, focusing on nutrition programs, farm commodities, crop insurance, and rural investments.

I need to carefully go through each section and provide concise summaries. The user wants at most one paragraph per section with 1-4 sentences, being specific about parties, quantities, and key details while avoiding vagueness. I'll start with Sec. 10101 as requested.

Looking at the structure, the bill has multiple titles and subtitles. Sec. 10101 is under "Nutrition" and deals with the Thrifty Food Plan. It defines the plan based on a 2021 report, sets household size adjustments (30% for 1-person up to 200% for 9+ persons), allows cost adjustments for Hawaii/Alaska, and limits re-evaluations to be cost-neutral after 2027.

For Sec. 10102 on SNAP work requirements, it expands exemptions to include parents of children under 14, pregnant women, and certain Native Americans. It modifies waiver criteria for noncontiguous states (excluding Guam/Virgin Islands) with good-faith compliance requirements until 2028.

Sec. 10103 restricts utility allowances to households with elderly/disabled members only. Sec. 10104 explicitly prohibits including internet expenses in shelter deductions. Sec. 10105 introduces state cost-sharing for SNAP based on payment error rates starting 2028, with federal shares from 85-100% depending on error rates.

The pattern continues through forestry rescissions (Sec. 10201 cuts $1.7B from previous allocations), commodity price supports (Sec. 10301 increases reference prices to 88% of Olympic average), and dairy program extensions (Sec. 10313 runs through 2031 with higher production caps).

I notice significant funding changes throughout - like Sec. 10601 boosting conservation to $700M annually by 2029, and Sec. 10602 creating a new $285M/year export promotion program. The bill also contains numerous technical adjustments across agricultural sectors.

I'll systematically work through each section in order, extracting the core changes while maintaining the requested specificity about amounts, percentages, and effective dates. The summaries will be factual and neutral, simply reporting what the legislative text modifies or establishes.
