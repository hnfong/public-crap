**Summary of the Facts**

The case of Ng Ka Ling and Another v. The Director of Immigration involves a group of Chinese nationals born on the Mainland of China who claim to be permanent residents of Hong Kong under the third category of Article 24(2) of the Basic Law. The third category includes persons of Chinese nationality born outside Hong Kong of residents listed in categories (1) and (2) in Article 24(2). The applicants, including Ng Ka Ling, Ng Tan Tan, and Tsui Kuen Nang, were born on the Mainland and have a parent who was a permanent resident of Hong Kong under the second category in Article 24(2). They entered Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, and applied for permanent resident status under the third category. However, the Director of Immigration denied their applications, citing the Immigration (Amendment) (No 2) Ordinance, which introduced a new scheme for establishing permanent resident status by descent.

The applicants challenged the Director's decisions in judicial review proceedings, arguing that the scheme was unconstitutional and that they had the right of abode in Hong Kong under Article 24(3) of the Basic Law. The case ultimately reached the Court of Final Appeal, which heard the appeals of the applicants and the Director.

**Summary of the Arguments**

The applicants, represented by Mr. Denis Chang SC and Mr. Philip Dykes SC, argued that the Immigration (Amendment) (No 3) Ordinance, which introduced the scheme for establishing permanent resident status by descent, was unconstitutional. They claimed that the scheme was a derogation from the Region's autonomy and that the requirement for a one-way permit before enjoying the right of abode was a restriction on the exercise of the right of abode, which was not justified by the Basic Law.

The Director of Immigration, represented by Mr. Geoffrey Ma SC, argued that the scheme was constitutional and that the requirement for a one-way permit was necessary to ensure that the applicants were not overstaying in Hong Kong. He also argued that the scheme was necessary to prevent the abuse of the right of abode and to maintain the economic prosperity and social stability of Hong Kong.

**Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The Court of Final Appeal's decision in Ng Ka Ling and Another v. The Director of Immigration established several important legal principles, including:

1. **The jurisdiction of the courts to interpret the Basic Law**: The Court held that the courts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have the jurisdiction to interpret the Basic Law, including the provisions that are within the limits of the Region's autonomy. This is a significant departure from the previous view that the courts were bound to seek an interpretation of the Basic Law from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.
2. **The power of interpretation of the Basic Law**: The Court held that the power of interpretation of the Basic Law is vested in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, but that the courts of the Region have the power to interpret "on their own" provisions which are within the limits of the Region's autonomy.
3. **The classification condition**: The Court established a new test for determining whether the classification condition is satisfied, which is that the provision in question must be predominantly interpreted in the context of the Basic Law, and that the classification must be arguable.
4. **The constitutionality of the No 3 Ordinance**: The Court held that the Immigration (Amendment) (No 3) Ordinance, which introduced the scheme for establishing permanent resident status by descent, is unconstitutional to the extent that it requires permanent residents to hold a one-way permit before enjoying the right of abode.
5. **The constitutionality of the retrospective provision**: The Court held that the retrospective provision in the No 3 Ordinance is unconstitutional, as it would render the applicants retrospectively liable for criminal offenses.
6. **The constitutionality of para 1(2)(b) of Schedule 1**: The Court held that para 1(2)(b) of Schedule 1, which excludes a child born out of wedlock from qualifying as a permanent resident, is unconstitutional.
7. **The constitutionality of the Provisional Legislative Council**: The Court held that the Provisional Legislative Council was a legally constituted body, and that the legislation passed by it was constitutional.

These principles have significant implications for the interpretation of the Basic Law and the exercise of the powers of the courts in Hong Kong. They also highlight the importance of the concept of autonomy in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the need for the courts to balance the interests of the Region with the interests of the Central People's Government.
