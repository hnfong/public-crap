### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts

The case involves a challenge to President Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China. The President declared national emergencies related to illegal drug trafficking and large trade deficits, invoking IEEPA's authority to "regulate...importation" to address these threats. The tariffs imposed included a 25% duty on most Canadian and Mexican imports and a 10% duty on most Chinese imports, later increased to 145% for Chinese goods. Two sets of plaintiffs—small businesses and states—sued, arguing IEEPA does not authorize tariffs. The lower courts agreed, but the Supreme Court consolidated the cases and held that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**Government (President Trump):**  
The government argued that IEEPA's grant of authority to "regulate...importation" includes the power to impose tariffs. It contended that tariffs are a traditional tool for regulating foreign commerce and that Congress intended IEEPA to provide broad emergency powers, including tariff authority. The government also emphasized the historical use of tariffs as a regulatory tool and the lack of explicit congressional prohibition on using IEEPA for tariffs.

**Plaintiffs (Learning Resources, Inc., et al.):**  
The plaintiffs argued that IEEPA's "regulate...importation" language does not authorize tariffs because the statute does not mention tariffs or duties. They contended that tariffs are a distinct taxing power reserved for Congress under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. The plaintiffs also relied on the major questions doctrine, arguing that the President's assertion of tariff authority was an "unheralded" and "transformative" expansion of executive power that required clear congressional authorization.

### 3. Majority Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The majority opinion, delivered by Chief Justice Roberts, held that IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs. The key legal principles are:

**a. Article I, Section 8 Vesting of Tariff Power:**  
The Court emphasized that the Constitution vests the power to "lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises" in Congress alone (Article I, Section 8). The tariff power is a core congressional function, and the President lacks inherent authority to impose tariffs during peacetime. The government conceded this point, relying solely on IEEPA.

**b. Major Questions Doctrine:**  
The Court applied the major questions doctrine, which requires clear congressional authorization for executive actions of major economic and political significance. The Court noted that IEEPA's "regulate...importation" language was not understood in 1977 to include tariff authority, as evidenced by historical practice (e.g., Nixon's 1971 tariffs were imposed under TWEA, not IEEPA) and the absence of any prior presidential invocation of IEEPA for tariffs. The Court rejected the government's argument that IEEPA's broad emergency powers implicitly include tariff authority.

**c. Textual Analysis of IEEPA:**  
The Court examined IEEPA's text and found no mention of tariffs or duties. The term "regulate" was interpreted to mean controlling or adjusting imports, not imposing taxes. The Court noted that Congress consistently uses explicit language (e.g., "duty," "tariff") when authorizing tariff powers in other statutes, and IEEPA's silence on this matter was intentional.

**d. Historical Practice and Precedent:**  
The Court highlighted that no President had ever invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs before Trump's actions. The historical use of tariffs as a regulatory tool did not translate to IEEPA's authorization, as Congress has always explicitly delegated tariff authority in other statutes. The Court also dismissed the government's reliance on the Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA) and a lower court's decision in *United States v. Yoshida International, Inc.*, noting that TWEA's tariff authority was limited and not representative of IEEPA's scope.

**e. Separation of Powers:**  
The Court reiterated that Congress alone holds the power of the purse and tariff policy, and the President's actions here encroached on that authority. The Court rejected the government's argument that tariffs are a regulatory tool akin to quotas or embargoes, emphasizing that tariffs are a form of taxation and revenue generation, which is exclusively congressional.

### 4. Dissenting Side's Legal Principles and Arguments

The dissent, authored by Justice Kavanaugh (joined by Justices Thomas and Alito), argued that IEEPA's "regulate...importation" language explicitly authorizes tariffs. The dissent's key points include:

**a. Textual Interpretation:**  
The dissent interpreted "regulate...importation" to include tariffs, citing dictionary definitions and historical usage. It argued that tariffs are a common means of regulating imports and that the term "regulate" encompasses monetary exactions like tariffs.

**b. Historical Practice:**  
The dissent emphasized that Presidents have long imposed tariffs under statutes with similar language (e.g., TWEA, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act). It cited *Federal Energy Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc.* (1976), where the Court upheld President Ford's tariffs under a statute authorizing "adjustment of imports" without explicit mention of tariffs.

**c. Major Questions Doctrine:**  
The dissent rejected the majority's application of the major questions doctrine, arguing that IEEPA's tariff authority was not "unheralded" in 1977. It pointed to the Nixon and Ford tariffs, the *Algonquin* decision, and the historical understanding of tariffs as regulatory tools as evidence of clear congressional intent.

**d. Foreign Affairs Exception:**  
The dissent argued that the major questions doctrine does not apply in foreign affairs cases, where Congress often grants the President broad discretion. It cited *Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.* and *Dames & Moore* as examples where the Court deferred to executive authority in foreign policy matters.

**e. Nondelegation Doctrine:**  
The dissent briefly addressed the nondelegation argument, noting that Congress can delegate tariff authority to the President under the Constitution's foreign affairs powers. It distinguished between core legislative powers (which cannot be delegated) and regulatory powers like tariffs, which are permissible delegations.

### 5. Striking or Unusual Aspects of the Case

**a. Split Decision:**  
The Court's decision was splintered, with three justices (Sotomayor, Kagan, Jackson) relying on statutory interpretation, three (Roberts, Gorsuch, Barrett) invoking the major questions doctrine, and two (Thomas, Alito) dissenting. This reflects deep divisions on the Court's approach to executive power and statutory interpretation.

**b. Novel Application of Major Questions Doctrine:**  
The majority's reliance on the major questions doctrine in a foreign affairs context was unprecedented. The Court had previously avoided applying the doctrine to foreign affairs statutes, but here it extended the doctrine to invalidate the President's tariff authority.

**c. Refund Implications:**  
The decision could require the government to refund billions of dollars in tariffs collected under IEEPA, a complex and potentially contentious process. The Court acknowledged this practical consequence but did not address it in its opinion.

**d. Trade Deal Uncertainty:**  
The ruling could undermine trade agreements negotiated under the shadow of IEEPA tariffs, creating uncertainty in international commerce. The government argued that the tariffs had facilitated trillions of dollars in trade deals, and the Court's decision could disrupt these arrangements.

**e. Historical Precedents Overturned:**  
The decision effectively overruled *Algonquin* (1976), where the Court had upheld similar tariff authority under Section 232. This departure from precedent was notable, as the Court had previously interpreted "adjust the imports" to include tariffs.

**f. Emergency Authority vs. Taxing Power:**  
The case highlighted the tension between the President's emergency powers under IEEPA and Congress's exclusive taxing power. The Court's refusal to extend IEEPA's regulatory authority to tariffs underscored the constitutional separation of powers in fiscal matters. [end of text]
