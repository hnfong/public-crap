## Summary of Bill Sections (Starting with Sec. 30001)

**Sec. 30001. Funding Cap for the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.** This section amends the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to reduce the maximum funding available to the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (BCFP) from 12% to 6.5% of the total funds available to the Federal Reserve System. This effectively limits the BCFPâ€™s ability to draw from Federal Reserve earnings.

**Sec. 30002. Rescission of Funds for Green and Resilient Retrofit Program for Multifamily Housing.** This section rescinds any remaining unspent funds from the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program for Multifamily Housing, which was originally authorized under Public Law 117-169 (passed in 2022). This means approximately $X amount of previously allocated money will be returned to the treasury (amount not specified in text).

**Sec. 30003. Securities and Exchange Commission Reserve Fund.** This section eliminates the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Reserve Fund established under Section 4 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Currently obligated funds can be used until October 1, 2025, but all remaining balances will be transferred to the general fund of the Treasury on that date, effectively closing the account.

**Sec. 30004. Appropriations for Defense Production Act.** This section appropriates an additional $1,000,000,000 (one billion dollars) for fiscal year 2025 to be used for carrying out the Defense Production Act. These funds will remain available until September 30, 2027, and can be used for projects related to bolstering domestic defense capabilities.
