Okay, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want a summary of the W v Registrar of Marriages case, covering four specific tasks: facts, arguments, legal principles, and any striking aspects. The user is likely a law student or someone researching LGBTQ+ rights, particularly transsexual individuals' rights to marry. They need a clear, concise breakdown of the case to grasp its legal implications.

First, I'll outline the facts. The appellant, W, is a post-operative male-to-female transsexual. She seeks to marry a man but is denied under the Marriage Ordinance. The Registrar argues that her biological sex remains male. The Court of Appeal upheld the Registrar's position, leading W to seek a judicial review. The key points here are W's medical history, the legal provisions, and the jurisdiction's stance before this case.

Next, summarizing the arguments. W's argument centers on her acquired gender being legally recognized, supported by constitutional rights (Basic Law, HKBOR). The Registrar counters with the traditional biological definition, citing the Corbett case and the need for legislative intervention. The user might be interested in how constitutional vs. statutory arguments are balanced here.

For legal principles, the main ratio decidendi involves the interpretation of "woman" and "female" in marriage laws. The majority rejects a remedial interpretation, sticking to biological criteria. The minority argues for a living instrument approach, influenced by international trends. The user probably wants to know the reasoning behind each stance and its implications for future cases.

The striking aspects include the majority's reliance on the Registrar's own admission regarding societal consensus and the emphasis on legislative vs. judicial roles. Also, the international context where many countries recognize transsexual marriages, contrasting with Hong Kong's position. The user might be highlighting the case's significance in showing Hong Kong's lag in legal recognition compared to global standards.

I need to ensure that the summary is accurate, especially regarding the legal principles. The user might be preparing for an exam or legal argument, so clarity on the constitutional vs. statutory interpretation is crucial. They might also be looking for precedents or how this case aligns with others, like Goodwin. Mentioning the ECtHR's role and the legislative process needed post-judgment would add depth.

Lastly, the user might have an unspoken need to understand why judicial review has limits here and the importance of legislative action. They could be interested in the balance between courts and legislatures in social policy changes. Emphasizing that the majority didn't invent new law but followed existing principles, while the minority called for legislative reform, would address this.

I should check if there are any nuances in the case that aren't obvious, like the specific medical criteria used by the Registrar. Also, note that the case doesn't address same-sex marriage, which might be a point of confusion. Clarifying that the focus is solely on transsexual individuals marrying the opposite sex is important.

In conclusion, the user needs a comprehensive yet concise analysis that differentiates between the majority and minority opinions, highlights the legal principles involved, and points out the case's broader implications. Ensuring that each section addresses these points clearly will meet their requirements.
