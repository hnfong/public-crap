Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a Supreme Court case opinion and wants me to answer five specific tasks based on it. First, I need to make sure I understand each part of the task.

Task 1 is to briefly summarize the facts. So I'll need to read through the case and pick out the key points: who the parties are, what the case is about, the lower court decisions, and the main issue. The case is about whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) allows the President to impose tariffs. The President, Trump, imposed tariffs on drugs from Canada, Mexico, and China, and also on imports from all countries to address trade deficits. The plaintiffs, small businesses and states, sued, arguing IEEPA doesn't authorize tariffs. The lower courts agreed with the plaintiffs, and the Supreme Court had to decide.

Task 2 is summarizing the arguments of the two parties. The Government (the President) argues that IEEPA's "regulate importation" clause includes tariffs, citing historical use, the Nixon tariffs, and the Algonquin case. The plaintiffs argue that tariffs are a tax, which is a core congressional power, and IEEPA doesn't explicitly mention tariffs, so it's not authorized.

Task 3 is the most detailed: summarizing the legal principles of the majority decision, focusing on the ratio decidendi. The majority, led by Chief Justice Roberts, uses the major questions doctrine. They argue that since tariffs are a core congressional power (taxing), Congress must clearly authorize it. They also say "regulate" doesn't include taxing, pointing to dictionary definitions and the absence of tariff-related terms in IEEPA. They mention the lack of historical precedent for using IEEPA for tariffs, unlike other statutes. The novel points here are the application of the major questions doctrine to tariff powers, especially in peacetime, and the argument that "regulate" doesn't encompass taxation.

Task 4 is the dissenting side's legal principles. The dissent, led by Justice Kavanaugh, argues that "regulate importation" historically includes tariffs, citing Nixon's 1971 tariffs, the Algonquin case, and the long history of presidential tariff authority. They also say the major questions doctrine shouldn't apply in foreign affairs, which is a key point. The dissent emphasizes that Congress has consistently delegated tariff authority to the President, so IEEPA's language is sufficient.

Task 5 is anything striking or unusual. The case is notable for the Supreme Court's application of the major questions doctrine to a tariff case, which is a core congressional power. Also, the fact that no President used IEEPA for tariffs before, but the dissent points to Nixon's use of TWEA. The potential for billions in refunds and trade deal disruptions is a practical consequence that's unusual.

Wait, I need to check if I'm missing any key points. The majority also mentions that taxing exports is unconstitutional, so "regulate" can't include tariffs because that would make IEEPA unconstitutional. That's a strong point. The dissent counters by saying the Court's interpretation would invalidate the Nixon tariffs and Algonquin.

Also, the majority's argument that the President's power to impose tariffs is "transformative" and unprecedented. The dissent argues it's not new, citing historical use. The majority's reliance on the major questions doctrine here is a big deal because it's a significant expansion of that doctrine, especially since the dissent says it shouldn't apply in foreign affairs.

Wait, the user mentioned "focus on the points that might be novel or controversial." So for the majority, the novel points are the application of the major questions doctrine to tariff powers (which is a core congressional power) and the argument that "regulate" doesn't include taxation. The dissent's argument about the major questions doctrine not applying in foreign affairs is also novel.

I should make sure to highlight that the majority is saying Congress must clearly authorize such a power, and since IEEPA doesn't, it's invalid. The dissent says the historical context shows Congress did authorize it through the "regulate" language.

For the striking part, the case is significant because it's the first time the Court has applied the major questions doctrine to a tariff case, and it's a major economic issue. The potential refunds and trade deal impacts are practical consequences that are unusual for a Supreme Court case. Also, the fact that the President's tariffs were part of a broader strategy (drug trafficking and trade deficits) adds context.

Wait, the user also mentioned "anything you find extraordinary," so maybe the fact that the Court is overturning a major executive action based on statutory interpretation, and the split in the Court—three justices using the major questions doctrine, three others using ordinary statutory interpretation, and the dissent arguing for a foreign affairs exception. The depth of the opinions, especially Gorsuch's concurrence on the history of the major questions doctrine, is also notable.

Let me check if I have all the key elements. The majority's reasoning: 1) Tariffs are a core congressional power (taxing), so Congress must clearly authorize it. 2) IEEPA's "regulate" doesn't include taxation, as per dictionary and statutory context. 3) No historical precedent for using IEEPA for tariffs. 4) The major questions doctrine applies here because the power is extraordinary.

Dissent's arguments: 1) "Regulate importation" has always included tariffs, as shown by Nixon's tariffs and Algonquin. 2) The major questions doctrine shouldn't apply in foreign affairs. 3) Congress has consistently delegated tariff authority.

Striking points: The Court's application of the major questions doctrine to a tariff case, the historical context of Nixon's tariffs, the potential economic impact (billions in refunds, trade deals), and the split in the Court's reasoning (some using major questions, others using statutory interpretation).

Wait, the user also mentioned "the principal dissent" and the other justices' opinions. The dissent by Kavanaugh is the main one, but Thomas and Alito join him. The majority has Roberts, with Gorsuch and Barrett joining part of the opinion. Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson concur in part, saying statutory interpretation alone suffices without the major questions doctrine.

I need to make sure the summary for task 3 is detailed. The majority's ratio decidendi is that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs because: (1) tariffs are a core congressional power (taxing), requiring clear congressional authorization; (2) "regulate" does not include taxation, as shown by dictionary definitions, statutory context (other statutes use "duty" or "tariff"), and the fact that taxing exports is unconstitutional; (3) the major questions doctrine applies here because the power is extraordinary, and Congress didn't clearly authorize it (no historical precedent, etc.).

The novel points here are the application of the major questions doctrine to a tariff case, which is a core power, and the argument that "regulate" can't include taxation. The dissent's counter that "regulate" does include tariffs, citing historical use, is also a key point.

For task 5, the striking part is that the Court is using the major questions doctrine to block a presidential action that's been used by previous presidents (Nixon, Ford) under similar statutes, but the Court says IEEPA is different. Also, the potential for massive refunds and trade deal disruptions is a practical consequence that's unusual for a legal case.

Wait, the user mentioned "anything you find extraordinary," so maybe the fact that the Court is so focused on the word "regulate" and whether it includes tariffs, which seems straightforward but the Court is taking a very strict view. Also, the historical argument about the Founding and the Constitution's tax power is a big deal.

Another point: The majority says that Congress has always used specific terms like "duty" or "tariff" when delegating tariff authority, so IEEPA's lack of those terms means it's not authorized. The dissent counters that the "regulate" language was sufficient, as seen in Nixon's case.

I need to make sure all these points are covered in the summaries. Let me structure each task step by step, keeping the summaries concise but hitting all the key points. For task 3, since it's detailed, I'll need to break it into multiple paragraphs as the user requested, focusing on the novel and controversial aspects.

Wait, the user said "there is no word limit," but to be thorough. So for the majority's legal principles, I should explain the major questions doctrine application, the statutory interpretation of "regulate," the constitutional argument about the taxing power, and the historical context. The novel aspects are the application of the major questions doctrine to a tariff case (which is a core power), the argument that "regulate" doesn't include taxation, and the emphasis on the lack of historical precedent.

For the dissent, the key points are the historical use of "regulate" to include tariffs, the Algonquin precedent, the argument that the major questions doctrine shouldn't apply in foreign affairs, and the point that Congress has consistently delegated tariff authority.

Striking points: The Court's decision could lead to billions in refunds, the fact that this is the first time the major questions doctrine is applied to a tariff case, the split in the Court's reasoning (some using major questions, others not), and the historical context of Nixon's tariffs being upheld under TWEA but now being deemed insufficient under IEEPA.

Wait, the user also mentioned "anything you find extraordinary," so maybe the fact that the Court is overturning a presidential action that was part of a national emergency declaration, which is a significant executive power. Also, the President's tariffs were part of a broader strategy to address drug trafficking and trade deficits, which are serious issues, but the Court is saying the statutory basis is lacking.

Another point: The Court's opinion mentions that the President's tariffs have "economic and political significance" that dwarfs other major questions cases, which is a strong statement. The dissent argues that the major questions doctrine shouldn't apply here because it's a foreign affairs case, which is a novel argument.

I think that's all. Now, I need to make sure each task is addressed clearly and concisely, with the key points highlighted. Let me start drafting each part.

### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts  
The case, *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump*, centers on whether the **International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA)** authorizes the President to impose **tariffs** on imports. Shortly after taking office, President Trump declared two national emergencies: one addressing **drug trafficking** from Canada, Mexico, and China, and another targeting **"large and persistent" trade deficits**. Under IEEPA, he imposed two sets of tariffs:  
- **Drug trafficking tariffs**: 25% on most Canadian/Mexican imports and 10% on most Chinese imports.  
- **"Reciprocal" tariffs**: A minimum 10% duty on all imports from all trading partners, with rates later raised to 145% on Chinese goods.  

The tariffs were implemented unilaterally, without congressional approval, and applied regardless of existing trade agreements. Petitioners—small businesses and states—sued, arguing IEEPA does not authorize tariffs. The District Court and the Federal Circuit (sitting *en banc*) ruled in favor of the petitioners, holding that IEEPA’s grant of authority to "regulate . . . importation" does not include the power to impose tariffs. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and consolidated the cases.  

---

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties  
**Government (President Trump)**:  
- IEEPA’s authorization to "regulate . . . importation" includes the power to impose tariffs, as "regulate" encompasses tools like tariffs, quotas, and embargoes.  
- Historical precedent supports this: President Nixon imposed 10% tariffs under IEEPA’s predecessor, the *Trading with the Enemy Act (TWEA)*, and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals upheld them in *United States v. Yoshida Int’l, Inc.* (1975).  
- The *Federal Energy Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc.* (1976) case confirmed that broadly worded statutes (e.g., "adjust the imports") authorize tariffs.  
- IEEPA’s language ("by means of instructions, licenses, or otherwise") permits flexible tariff imposition.  
- The major questions doctrine does not apply because tariffs are a routine tool in foreign affairs, and Congress has long delegated tariff authority.  

**Petitioners (Plaintiffs)**:  
- Tariffs are a **core congressional power** (taxing), and IEEPA does not explicitly authorize them.  
- "Regulate" does not include taxation: Dictionaries define "regulate" as controlling or adjusting, not raising revenue. Congress consistently uses terms like "duty" or "tariff" when delegating tariff authority (e.g., in the Tariff Act of 1930).  
- IEEPA’s text omits "tariff," "duty," or "tax," and no President has ever used IEEPA to impose tariffs (unlike other statutes).  
- The major questions doctrine applies: Congress would not delegate such a sweeping power without clear language, especially for a core power like tariffs.  
- IEEPA’s delegation of "regulate . . . importation" is limited to non-taxing measures (e.g., embargoes, quotas), not revenue-raising tariffs.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) of the Majority Decision  
The **majority opinion**, authored by Chief Justice Roberts, holds that **IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs**. The reasoning rests on three interconnected pillars: the **major questions doctrine**, **statutory interpretation**, and **constitutional separation of powers**.  

#### **I. The Major Questions Doctrine as the Core Legal Principle**  
The majority applies the **major questions doctrine**—a judicial canon requiring **"clear congressional authorization"** for executive actions of "highly consequential power." The doctrine arises from two overlapping principles:  
1. **Separation of powers**: Congress, not the executive, holds the "core congressional power of the purse" (i.e., the power to tax).  
2. **Practical legislative intent**: Congress would not delegate such a sweeping power through ambiguous language.  

The Court emphasizes that **tariffs are a quintessential tax**, falling squarely within the constitutional power to "lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises" (Article I, §8). The Framers explicitly vested this power in Congress alone, rejecting any executive authority to impose tariffs in peacetime. The majority rejects the Government’s argument that "tariffs implicate foreign affairs," noting that the Framers gave Congress, not the President, the power to impose tariffs *even in foreign affairs contexts*.  

The Court stresses that the **stakes here dwarf other major questions cases**: The tariffs could reduce the national deficit by $4 trillion and disrupt $15 trillion in trade agreements. The Government’s claim that the tariffs are "unbounded in scope, amount, and duration" further cements their "extraordinary" nature. The majority concludes that **Congress must "speak clearly"** to delegate such power, and IEEPA fails this test.  

#### **II. Statutory Interpretation: "Regulate" Does Not Encompass Taxation**  
The majority meticulously analyzes IEEPA’s key phrase: **"regulate . . . importation"** (50 U.S.C. §1702(a)(1)(B)). It argues that:  
- **"Regulate" means to "fix, establish, or control; to adjust by rule, method, or established mode; to direct by rule or restriction; to subject to governing principles or laws"** (Black’s Law Dictionary). This definition **excludes taxation**, as taxes are a distinct power.  
- **Congress consistently uses "regulate" to mean non-taxing control** (e.g., "regulate the trading of securities" in the Securities Act does not include taxing). When Congress wants to delegate *taxing* authority, it uses explicit terms like "duty" or "tariff" (e.g., 19 U.S.C. §1338(d)).  
- **IEEPA’s text is silent on tariffs**: The statute lists nine distinct powers ("investigate, block, regulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit"), but **none explicitly include revenue-raising**. The omission is telling, as Congress has always specified tariff authority elsewhere.  
- **A contrary reading would render IEEPA unconstitutional**: IEEPA authorizes the President to "regulate . . . exportation," but **taxing exports is expressly forbidden by the Constitution** (Article I, §9, cl. 5). If "regulate" included taxation, IEEPA would violate the Constitution.  

The Court rejects the Government’s arguments:  
- **"Regulate" naturally includes tariffs because it lies between "compel" and "prohibit"**: The majority counters that tariffs are **different in kind, not degree**—they operate directly on domestic importers to raise revenue, whereas other IEEPA powers (e.g., embargoes) are about *controlling* transactions, not *taxing* them.  
- **Precedent from TWEA and *Yoshida***: The Court dismisses *Yoshida* (1975) as a single, limited appellate decision that did not establish a "well-settled" meaning. It also notes that **no President has ever used IEEPA to impose tariffs** (unlike TWEA, which was used for tariffs in 1971).  
- **Wartime precedents are inapposite**: The Court rejects the argument that the President has inherent wartime authority to impose tariffs, as the case involves **peacetime emergencies**.  

#### **III. Novel and Controversial Aspects of the Majority’s Reasoning**  
1. **The major questions doctrine’s application to a core congressional power**: The Court explicitly rejects the idea that the doctrine has an "emergency exception" or a "foreign affairs exception." This is **novel** because the Government and dissent argued that tariffs inherently involve foreign affairs, which should exempt the doctrine. The majority insists that **"the Framers gave Congress alone the power to impose tariffs during peacetime,"** regardless of foreign affairs implications.  
2. **"Regulate" does not include taxation**: The Court’s insistence that "regulate" is **inherently distinct from taxation** is controversial. Historically, Congress has treated "regulate" and "tax" as separate powers (e.g., *Gibbons v. Ogden*), but the majority’s rigid separation is a sharp departure from prior interpretations where "regulate" could include revenue-raising measures (e.g., *Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ill. v. United States*).  
3. **The "lack of historical precedent" as dispositive**: The Court emphasizes that **no President has ever used IEEPA to impose tariffs** in its 49-year history, which it treats as "telling evidence" that the power is beyond the President’s reach. This contrasts with the dissent’s argument that Nixon’s 1971 tariffs under TWEA (which used identical language) established a clear precedent.  
4. **The constitutional argument against IEEPA’s text**: The Court’s claim that IEEPA would be unconstitutional if "regulate" included taxation (due to the export tax ban) is **bold and novel**. It forces a textualist reading that prioritizes constitutional constraints over statutory ambiguity.  

The majority concludes that **IEEPA’s delegation of "regulate . . . importation" does not include tariffs**, and the President’s tariffs must be struck down. The judgment is affirmed in *V.O.S. Selections* and vacated in *Learning Resources*.  

---

### 4. Legal Principles and Arguments of the Dissenting Side  
**Justice Kavanaugh’s dissent** (joined by Thomas and Alito) argues that **IEEPA clearly authorizes tariffs** and that the majority’s application of the major questions doctrine is **unprecedented and incorrect**. The dissent’s reasoning rests on three pillars:  

#### **I. Statutory Interpretation: "Regulate Importation" Includes Tariffs**  
- **Dictionary and historical usage**: "Regulate" means "to control, adjust by rule, or subject to governing principles," which **clearly includes tariffs** (e.g., *Gibbons v. Ogden* states that "the power to regulate commerce includes the power of laying duties").  
- **Congress’s consistent practice**: Since the Founding, Congress has repeatedly delegated tariff authority to the President (e.g., the Tariff Act of 1930, Trade Expansion Act of 1962). The dissent notes that **"tariffs are a common means of regulating importation"** (19 U.S.C. §1338(d), §2132(a)).  
- **The *Yoshida* and *Algonquin* precedents**:  
  - In *Yoshida* (1975), the Court upheld Nixon’s 10% tariffs under TWEA (which used identical "regulate . . . importation" language).  
  - In *Algonquin* (1976), the Court unanimously held that "adjust the imports" (a phrase similar to "regulate . . . importation") authorized tariffs.  
  - The dissent argues that **Congress’s 1977 re-enactment of "regulate . . . importation" in IEEPA** (after *Yoshida* and *Algonquin*) confirms that Congress understood the phrase to include tariffs.  

#### **II. The Major Questions Doctrine Does Not Apply in Foreign Affairs**  
The dissent **rejects the majority’s application of the major questions doctrine** on two grounds:  
1. **The doctrine has no historical basis in foreign affairs**: The Court has **never applied the major questions doctrine to foreign affairs statutes**. In *Curtiss-Wright* (1936), the Court held that Congress may delegate broad authority to the President in foreign affairs, and **"Congress in this field of governmental power to lay down narrowly definite standards" is "unwise."**  
2. **The case involves foreign affairs**: IEEPA’s tariffs are **"best understood" as a tool to incentivize foreign behavior** (e.g., trade deals with China, the UK, and Japan). The dissent cites *Dames & Moore* (1981), where the Court upheld a presidential action under IEEPA *without* requiring "clear congressional authorization," because it involved foreign affairs.  

The dissent argues that **applying the major questions doctrine here would create unprecedented uncertainty** in foreign policy. For example, it would invalidate tariffs imposed under TWEA (which uses identical language) and Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act (which the Court previously upheld in *Algonquin*).  

#### **III. The Dissent’s Broader Constitutional Argument**  
The dissent (joined by Thomas) argues that **tariffs are not a "core legislative power"** subject to the nondelegation doctrine. It contends that:  
- **Tariffs are a "prerogative power"** (not a core legislative power), as they involve **foreign commerce**, which the Founders treated as distinct from domestic affairs.  
- **Congress has consistently delegated tariff authority** since the Founding (e.g., the 1790s statutes granting the President power to regulate foreign trade).  
- **The Constitution does not require Congress to "speak clearly"** for tariff delegations, as Congress has long delegated such authority.  

The dissent concludes that **IEEPA clearly authorizes tariffs**, and the majority’s decision is a **"transformative expansion"** of the major questions doctrine that **undermines presidential authority in foreign affairs**.  

---

### 5. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case  
1. **The Supreme Court’s application of the major questions doctrine to a core congressional power (tariffs)**: This is **unprecedented**. The doctrine has been used in cases involving environmental regulation (*West Virginia v. EPA*), student loan forgiveness (*Biden v. Nebraska*), and workplace safety (*NFIB v. OSHA*), but **never to block a presidential action involving the constitutional power to tax**. The Court’s insistence that Congress must "speak clearly" to delegate tariff authority is a **radical departure** from historical practice.  

2. **The historical irony of Nixon’s 1971 tariffs**: The majority dismisses Nixon’s 10% tariffs (imposed under TWEA) as "limited" and "not precedent-setting," but the dissent notes that **Nixon’s tariffs were upheld by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals** and **were widely publicized** (Nixon announced them in a primetime address). The Court’s refusal to acknowledge this precedent is **striking**, as it effectively retroactively invalidates a major historical executive action.  

3. **The potential economic fallout**: The Court’s decision could require **billions in refunds** to importers (as acknowledged at oral argument) and **disrupt trade deals worth trillions of dollars** (e.g., with China, the UK, and Japan). The Government argued that the tariffs "helped facilitate trade deals," and the dissent warned of "significant uncertainty" in ongoing negotiations. This is **unusual for a Supreme Court case**, which rarely has such immediate, massive economic consequences.  

4. **The Court’s internal split on the major questions doctrine**: The decision reveals a **deep ideological divide** over the doctrine:  
   - **Roberts, Gorsuch, and Barrett** apply the doctrine, treating it as a constitutional safeguard.  
   - **Kagan, Sotomayor, and Jackson** reject the doctrine, arguing that **ordinary statutory interpretation suffices** (they agree with the result but not the reasoning).  
   - **Thomas** rejects the doctrine entirely, arguing that Congress can delegate *any* power (including tariffs) without clear language.  
   This **fragmentation** underscores the doctrine’s contested status in modern jurisprudence.  

5. **The Court’s constitutional argument about "regulate" and taxation**: The majority’s claim that **"regulate" cannot include taxation** because it would make IEEPA unconstitutional (due to the export tax ban) is **bold and novel**. It forces a textualist reading that prioritizes constitutional constraints over statutory ambiguity—a move that could reshape how courts interpret other statutes.  

6. **The dissent’s foreign affairs exception**: The dissent’s argument that the **major questions doctrine does not apply in foreign affairs** is **untested and potentially revolutionary**. If adopted, it would exempt all foreign policy actions from the doctrine, fundamentally altering the balance of power between Congress and the executive in international affairs.  

In sum, this case is **remarkable** not only for its legal significance but also for its **practical consequences** (billions in refunds, trade deal uncertainty) and its **symbolic weight** in the ongoing debate over executive power, congressional delegation, and the role of the major questions doctrine. The Court’s decision marks a **watershed moment** in constitutional law, with implications far beyond tariffs. [end of text]
