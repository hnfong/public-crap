### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts

This case involves a dispute over the validity of two wills executed by the late Nina Wang, a wealthy businesswoman and philanthropist. The plaintiff, the Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd, sought to have the 2002 will, which left her entire estate to the foundation, declared valid and the 2006 will, which purportedly left her estate to the first defendant, declared invalid. The first defendant, Chan Chun Chuen, claimed that the 2006 will was genuine and that he had been in a long-term romantic relationship with Nina Wang, which she had intended to formalize through the will.

Nina Wang had previously been involved in a high-profile legal battle over the will of her late husband, Teddy Wang, which was initially found to be forged but later upheld as valid. The 2002 will was not disputed and was accepted as genuine. However, the 2006 will was challenged on the grounds of forgery. The judge found that the 2006 will was a forgery, concluding that the first defendant had fabricated the document to gain control of Nina Wang’s vast fortune. The judge also found that the first defendant had lied about his relationship with Nina Wang and had engaged in a clandestine affair with her, which was kept secret from her family and the public.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties

**Plaintiff (Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd):**  
The plaintiff argued that the 2006 will was a forgery and that the first defendant had fabricated it to gain control of Nina Wang’s estate. The plaintiff emphasized that Nina Wang had consistently supported the charitable foundation and had no intention of leaving her wealth to the first defendant. The plaintiff also highlighted the first defendant’s involvement in various financial transactions with Nina Wang, including large sums of money transferred to companies he controlled, which were not consistent with a genuine will. The plaintiff further argued that the first defendant had lied about his relationship with Nina Wang and had engaged in a secret affair, which was not in line with her known character and values.

**First Defendant (Chan Chun Chuen):**  
The first defendant argued that the 2006 will was genuine and that he had been in a long-term romantic relationship with Nina Wang, which she had intended to formalize through the will. He claimed that the will was signed and witnessed by Nina Wang and that she had intended to leave her estate to him. The first defendant also argued that the 2002 will was a charade created to support the litigation over Teddy Wang’s will and that the charitable foundation was not a genuine concern of Nina Wang. He further claimed that the judge had not properly evaluated the evidence and had been biased against him due to the nature of their relationship.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) of the Case

The case involved several key legal principles, particularly in the areas of wills, forgery, and the admissibility of expert evidence in handwriting analysis. The court’s decision was based on a thorough examination of the evidence, including the testimony of witnesses, the physical characteristics of the documents, and the credibility of the parties involved.

**1. The Validity of a Will and the Burden of Proof:**  
The court emphasized that the burden of proof lies with the party challenging the validity of a will. In this case, the first defendant had to prove that the 2006 will was genuine, and the court found that the evidence did not support this claim. The judge concluded that the 2006 will was a forgery, based on the testimony of the witnesses who had signed it and the physical characteristics of the document. The court also considered the credibility of the first defendant, noting that he had lied about his relationship with Nina Wang and had a history of dishonesty.

**2. The Role of Expert Evidence in Handwriting Analysis:**  
The court examined the expert evidence provided by both parties regarding the authenticity of the signatures on the 2006 will. The judge accepted the opinion of the plaintiff’s expert, Mr. Radley, who concluded that the signatures were forgeries. The court rejected the first defendant’s expert, Mr. Westwood, who had argued that the signatures were genuine. The court found that Mr. Westwood’s evidence was unreliable and that his use of deteriorated hospital signatures for comparison was inappropriate. The court also rejected the first defendant’s argument that the judge had failed to consider the statistical likelihood of a forger producing a signature with multiple rare features.

**3. The Importance of the Context and Circumstances of the Will:**  
The court considered the context in which the 2006 will was created. The judge noted that Nina Wang had been diagnosed with terminal cancer and was in poor health at the time the will was allegedly signed. The judge also found that the first defendant had a history of financial transactions with Nina Wang, including large sums of money transferred to companies he controlled, which were inconsistent with a genuine will. The court also considered the fact that Nina Wang had consistently supported the charitable foundation and had no intention of leaving her estate to the first defendant.

**4. The Role of the Court in Assessing the Credibility of Witnesses:**  
The court emphasized the importance of assessing the credibility of witnesses, particularly in cases involving forgery and fraud. The judge found that the first defendant had lied about his relationship with Nina Wang and had a history of dishonesty. The court also noted that the first defendant had attempted to manipulate the evidence and had not provided a credible explanation for the circumstances surrounding the 2006 will.

**5. The Legal Consequences of Forgery and Fraud:**  
The court concluded that the first defendant had knowingly fabricated the 2006 will in an attempt to gain control of Nina Wang’s vast fortune. The court emphasized that such an act was an egregious abuse of the court process and that the first defendant had acted in bad faith. The court ordered that the costs of the litigation be awarded on an indemnity basis, reflecting the seriousness of the first defendant’s actions.

### 4. Anything Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable About the Case

This case is remarkable for several reasons, both legally and personally. First, it involves a high-profile individual with a vast fortune and a complex personal life, which adds a layer of drama and public interest to the legal proceedings. The case also highlights the importance of the credibility of witnesses and the role of expert evidence in determining the authenticity of a will.

Another striking aspect of the case is the relationship between Nina Wang and the first defendant. The court found that their relationship was clandestine and that the first defendant had lied about the nature of their relationship. This raises questions about the ethical implications of such a relationship and the potential for abuse of power and trust.

The case also demonstrates the legal system’s ability to handle complex and emotionally charged disputes, particularly when the stakes are high and the evidence is contested. The court’s detailed analysis of the evidence, including the handwriting of the signatures and the credibility of the witnesses, shows the importance of thorough and impartial judicial review in such cases.

Finally, the case is notable for the large sums of money involved and the potential for significant financial gain through the fabrication of a will. The court’s decision to award costs on an indemnity basis reflects the seriousness of the first defendant’s actions and the court’s commitment to upholding the integrity of the legal process.
