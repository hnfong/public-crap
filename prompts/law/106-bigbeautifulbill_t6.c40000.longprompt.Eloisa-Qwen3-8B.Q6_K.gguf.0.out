Okay, the user wants a summary of every section in this bill, starting with Sec. 60001. The bill is quite extensive, especially Title VI, which has a lot of rescission sections. I need to make sure I cover each section concisely, with at most one paragraph of four sentences. The user emphasized being specific about parties, entities, and quantities, so I should avoid vague terms.

First, I'll start with Sec. 60001. It's about rescinding funding for clean heavy-duty vehicles under the Clean Air Act. I need to mention the specific section (132) and the unobligated balances. The user might be interested in environmental policies, so highlighting the rescission of funds for emissions reduction is key.

Next, Sec. 60002 repeals the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. I should note that it's section 134 of the Clean Air Act and that unobligated funds are rescinded. This shows a broader effort to roll back climate-related initiatives.

Sec. 60003 deals with diesel emissions reductions. The funding is from Public Law 117-169, section 60104. I need to specify that unobligated balances are rescinded here too. The user might be tracking funding for specific environmental programs.

Sec. 60004 is another rescission for air pollution funding. Again, from Public Law 117-169, section 60105. It's important to mention the specific law and section to show the context.

Sec. 60005 targets air pollution at schools. The funding is from section 60106 of the same law. This could be relevant for education and public health, so I should note the specific focus on schools.

Sec. 60006 is about the low emissions electricity program under the Clean Air Act, section 135. Rescinding unobligated funds here ties into broader energy policies.

Sec. 60007 involves section 60108 of Public Law 117-169, which relates to section 211(o) of the Clean Air Act. This might be part of a larger effort to adjust environmental regulations.

Sec. 60008 rescinds funding for the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act implementation. This connects to industrial policies and emissions standards.

Sec. 60009 is about enforcement technology and public information. Again, from Public Law 117-169, section 60110. This shows a focus on regulatory enforcement.

Sec. 60010 deals with greenhouse gas corporate reporting. Rescinding funds here indicates a rollback of corporate accountability measures.

Sec. 60011 is about environmental product declarations. Rescinding funding here affects product sustainability initiatives.

Sec. 60012 is a bit more complex. It rescinds methane emissions reduction funding and amends the deadline to 2034. This is significant for climate policy, as it extends the program's timeline.

Sec. 60013 rescinds funding for greenhouse gas plans and implementation grants. This ties into broader climate action funding.

Sec. 60014 is about EPA reviews. Rescinding funds here affects the agency's operational efficiency.

Sec. 60015 is about low-embodied carbon labeling. Rescinding this funding impacts construction material standards.

Sec. 60016 is about environmental and climate justice block grants. Rescinding these affects funding for marginalized communities.

Sec. 60017 involves ESA recovery plans. Rescinding funds here affects endangered species conservation.

Sec. 60018 is about environmental data collection. Rescinding this impacts data-driven environmental policies.

Sec. 60019 is about neighborhood access grants. Rescinding this affects transportation equity programs.

Sec. 60020 is about federal building assistance. Rescinding this affects infrastructure projects.

Sec. 60021 is about low-carbon materials for federal buildings. Rescinding this impacts sustainable construction.

Sec. 60022 is about GSA sustainable technologies. Rescinding this affects federal procurement policies.

Sec. 60023 is about environmental review funds. Rescinding this affects project approvals.

Sec. 60024 is about low-carbon transportation materials. Rescinding this impacts transportation sustainability.

Sec. 60025 is a funding appropriation for the Kennedy Center. This is a specific cultural project, so it's a bit different from the rescissions.

Sec. 60026 amends NEPA to allow project sponsor opt-in fees. This changes the environmental review process, potentially speeding up approvals with fees.

I need to ensure each summary is concise, specific, and within the sentence limit. The user might be a policy analyst, researcher, or someone interested in environmental and fiscal policies. They want a clear, structured overview to understand the bill's impact. I should avoid jargon where possible and focus on the practical effects of each section. Also, since the bill is large, the user might appreciate the attention to detail in each section's summary. I'll make sure to mention the specific laws, sections, and entities involved to meet their request for specificity.
