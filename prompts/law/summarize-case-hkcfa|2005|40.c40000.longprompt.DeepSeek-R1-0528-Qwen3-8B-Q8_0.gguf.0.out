Okay, let me start by understanding the user's query. They want a summary of the Leung Kwok Hung case, covering facts, arguments, legal principles, and any striking aspects. The user is likely a law student or researcher focusing on constitutional law, particularly in Hong Kong. They need a concise yet comprehensive breakdown to grasp the case's significance.

First, I'll outline the facts. The case involves a protest procession that didn't comply with notification requirements, leading to convictions. The appellants challenged the Ordinance's constitutionality, specifically the Commissioner's discretion under "public order (ordre public)". The Court of Appeal upheld the convictions, but the higher court allowed the case to proceed.

Now, the arguments. The appellants argued the statutory scheme was too vague and uncertain, violating the Basic Law and ICCPR. The government countered that the scheme was constitutional and necessary for maintaining order. The key points here are the interpretation of "public order" and the necessity requirement.

For legal principles, the ratio decidendi revolves around the constitutional requirements for restricting fundamental rights: prescribed by law and necessity. The court emphasized the need for legal certainty and the proportionality test. The severance of "public order" from "ordre public" is crucial because the latter was deemed too vague. Also, the distinction between prior restraint and criminal sanctions is important, as the Ordinance's notification requirement was upheld but the criminal penalties in s.17A were struck down.

The striking aspect is the detailed analysis of legal certainty and the innovative approach of severing parts of the statute. The case also highlights the tension between maintaining public order and protecting fundamental freedoms, a common issue in constitutional law.

I should check if there's any deeper need. The user might be preparing for an exam or writing a paper on constitutional challenges in Hong Kong. They need not just a summary but also the reasoning behind the court's decisions, especially the novel points like severance and the narrow interpretation of "public order". They might also be interested in how international human rights standards are applied in Hong Kong's legal system post-handover.

Make sure the summary is clear, addresses both parties' arguments, and explains the legal principles thoroughly. The user probably wants to understand the practical implications of these principles, like how vague laws can be struck down and the importance of judicial review in protecting fundamental rights.

Okay, let's break down the case of Leung Kwok Hung and Others v. HKSAR.

**1. Brief Summary of Facts:**

On February 10, 2002, a group of about 40 people gathered at Chater Garden in Hong Kong for a protest procession against the conviction of an activist for assaulting and obstructing a police officer. Organized by Leung Kwok Hung (the 1st appellant), the procession ignored police advice regarding the required notification procedure under the Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245). It proceeded along Queensway towards Police Headquarters, growing to about 96 participants. After arriving and demonstrating peacefully for an hour, the organizers were prosecuted under Section 17A(3)(b)(i) of the Ordinance for holding an unauthorized assembly (since notification was not obtained). Leung Kwok Hung was charged with holding the assembly, while the other two organizers (2nd and 3rd appellants) were charged with assisting in holding it. They were convicted and bound over for $500 each for three months. The appellants challenged the constitutionality of the Ordinance's notification and control scheme for public processions, arguing it was too vague and broadly empowered the police to restrict their fundamental right of peaceful assembly.

**2. Brief Summary of Arguments:**

*   **Appellants (represented by Martin Lee SC):** Argued that the Commissioner's statutory discretion to restrict processions under the purpose of "public order (ordre public)" was too wide and uncertain to satisfy the Basic Law's requirement that restrictions must be "prescribed by law." They contended that the concept of "ordre public" was imprecise and allowed for arbitrary exercise of power by the police, thereby violating the fundamental right of peaceful assembly. They also argued that the scheme improperly criminalized the exercise of this right.
*   **Respondent (Government, represented by Gerard McCoy SC):** Argued that the notification requirement was a standard practice in many jurisdictions to allow the police to plan and manage public processions, ensuring public safety and preventing disorder. They maintained that the Ordinance incorporated the legitimate purposes for restricting assembly (including public order) as defined in the ICCPR, providing sufficient legal certainty. They also submitted that "public order (ordre public)" should be interpreted narrowly (as public order in the law and order sense) and that the scheme was necessary and proportionate.

**3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi):**

The case established several key legal principles regarding the fundamental right of peaceful assembly under the Basic Law and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (Cap. 383):

*   **Fundamental Right and its Relationship to Expression:** The right of peaceful assembly is a cornerstone of democratic society, intrinsically linked to freedom of speech. It allows citizens to voice criticisms, air grievances, and seek redress, essential for a functioning democracy. (Paragraphs 1-4)
*   **Constitutional Requirements for Restriction:** Any restriction on fundamental rights (including assembly) must satisfy two requirements:
    1.  **Prescribed by Law:** Restrictions must be provided by law and formulated with sufficient precision to give citizens a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct is restricted. This requires legal certainty, meaning the law must be accessible, clear, and not overly vague. (Paragraphs 12, 18, 25-30, 78-80)
    2.  **Necessity:** Restrictions must be necessary in a democratic society for legitimate purposes, including national security, public safety, public order, protection of public health or morals, or protection of the rights and freedoms of others. (Paragraphs 12, 18, 30, 33-39)
*   **Proportionality Test:** The necessity requirement is operationalized through a proportionality test. This test involves two main limbs:
    1.  **Rational Connection:** The restriction must be rationally connected to the legitimate purpose it seeks to serve. (Paragraphs 33-39, 89-94)
    2.  **No More Than Necessary:** The means used to restrict the right must be no more than what is necessary to achieve the specific purpose. (Paragraphs 33-39, 89-94) This means the restriction should be the least severe option available to achieve the objective.
*   **Incorporation of International Standards:** The Hong Kong Bill of Rights (BORO) incorporates the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) as applied to Hong Kong. The Ordinance, in turn, uses the ICCPR's definition of legitimate purposes ("public order (ordre public)", etc.). (Paragraphs 12, 15, 18, 25, 30, 33, 78-80)
*   **Narrow Interpretation of "Public Order":** The court distinguished between the constitutional concept "public order (ordre public)" (which includes broader societal functions) and the narrower, more concrete police concept "public order" (meaning order in the law and order sense, i.e., preventing disorder). The latter was considered sufficiently certain to satisfy the "prescribed by law" requirement. (Paragraphs 78-80, 93-94)
*   **Severance Doctrine:** If a provision is found to be unconstitutional due to vagueness, the court should sever the valid part from the invalid part, allowing the valid part to stand independently. This was applied here, striking down the part of the Ordinance dealing with "public order (ordre public)" but upholding the part dealing with "public order" (law and order sense). (Paragraphs 82-85, 93-94)
*   **Role of Notification:** Notification requirements themselves, if sufficiently certain and framed within the legitimate purposes, can be constitutional. They facilitate proper policing and crowd control, which are necessary measures to protect public safety and the rights of others. (Paragraphs 93-94, 132-140)
*   **Unconstitutionality of s.17A:** The specific criminal offence provision (s.17A) criminalizing the holding of an unauthorized procession was deemed unconstitutional because it improperly criminalized the exercise of the fundamental right of peaceful assembly, even though the underlying notification requirement might be constitutional. (Paragraphs 138-140, 205-215)

**4. Striking, Unusual or Remarkable Aspects:**

*   **Detailed Analysis of Legal Certainty:** The judgment provides an exceptionally thorough analysis of the meaning and importance of "legal certainty" in the context of fundamental rights restrictions, referencing numerous international and domestic cases and principles. This level of detail is remarkable.
*   **Focus on the "Prescribed by Law" Requirement:** While many cases focus on the necessity requirement, this judgment places significant emphasis on the "prescribed by law" requirement, particularly scrutinizing the scope and clarity of the Commissioner's statutory discretion.
*   **Narrow Interpretation of "ordre public":** The court's decision to narrowly interpret "public order (ordre public)" as "public order" (law and order sense) to save the provision from unconstitutionality is a notable interpretive move. It essentially read down the potentially overbroad term.
*   **Severance of "ord
