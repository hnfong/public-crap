Okay, let's tackle this case summary. First, I need to go through the provided judgment and extract the necessary information for each of the four tasks. 

Starting with the facts of the case. The case is Leung Kwok Hung and Others v. HKSAR [2. The appellants were convicted for holding an unauthorized procession in 2002. The procession was a protest against a conviction of an activist. The police had asked them to notify, but they refused, leading to the charges under the Public Order Ordinance. The convictions were upheld in the Court of Appeal, and they appealed to the Court of Final Appeal.

Next, the arguments of the two parties. The appellants argued that the statutory scheme under the Public Order Ordinance, particularly the Commissioner's discretion to restrict assemblies for "public order (ordre public)", was too vague and thus unconstitutional. The government defended the Ordinance, stating it was necessary for public safety and order, and that the restrictions were proportionate.

For the legal principles, the court discussed the constitutional rights under the Basic Law and ICCPR, focusing on the right to peaceful assembly. They emphasized that any restriction must be "prescribed by law" and "necessary in a democratic society". The court found that "public order (ordre public)" was too broad and uncertain, violating the "prescribed by law" requirement. However, they severed the problematic part, leaving "public order" (maintaining law and order) as a valid ground. The necessity test required proportionality, which the remaining provisions satisfied.

The dissenting opinion by Bokhary PJ argued that the entire prior restraint provisions were unconstitutional, emphasizing the need for strict scrutiny and the dangers of vague standards.

For the striking aspects, the case is notable for its detailed analysis of freedom of assembly in Hong Kong, the application of international human rights standards, and the court's approach to severing unconstitutional parts of legislation. The dissent also highlights the tension between executive discretion and judicial oversight in protecting fundamental rights.

I need to ensure each section is clear and concise, using the judgment's details accurately. Also, check for any nuances in the legal reasoning, especially regarding the severance and the dissent's stance.

### 1. Summary of the Facts  
The case involved the convictions of three appellants (including activist Leung Kwok Hung) for holding an unauthorized public procession in Hong Kong on February 10, 2002. The procession, numbering around 96 participants, protested the conviction of an activist for assaulting a police officer. The group refused to comply with the Public Order Ordinance’s requirement to notify the police in advance, leading to charges under Section 17A(3)(b)(i) of the Ordinance, which criminalizes unauthorized assemblies. The appellants were bound over on summary conviction. They appealed to the Court of Final Appeal, challenging the constitutionality of the Ordinance’s restrictions on peaceful assembly, particularly the broad discretion granted to the police commissioner to restrict assemblies for "public order (ordre public)."

### 2. Arguments of the Parties  
**Appellants’ Arguments:**  
- The statutory scheme under the Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245) violated the constitutional guarantees of freedom of assembly under Article 27 of the Basic Law and Article 17 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (BORO), which incorporates the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR).  
- The Commissioner’s discretion to restrict assemblies for the purpose of "public order (ordre public)" was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, failing the "prescribed by law" requirement.  
- The concept of "ordre public" was too imprecise to satisfy legal certainty, as it encompassed undefined societal interests beyond mere public safety or law and order.  
- The necessity test (proportionality) was not met because the broad discretion allowed arbitrary restrictions on peaceful assembly.  

**Respondent’s (Government) Arguments:**  
- The Ordinance’s restrictions were necessary to balance public safety, order, and the rights of others, as permitted under the ICCPR and Basic Law.  
- The scheme’s notification requirements and discretionary powers were reasonable and proportionate, ensuring public order while accommodating peaceful assembly.  
- The "public order (ordre public)" standard was sufficiently clear in context and aligned with international human rights standards.  
- The severance of any unconstitutional terms (e.g., narrowing "ordre public" to "public order") would preserve the statute’s validity.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The Court’s decision focused on the constitutional validity of the Public Order Ordinance’s restrictions on peaceful assembly, emphasizing two key principles:  

#### **A. Constitutional Requirements for Restricting Fundamental Rights**  
1. **"Prescribed by Law" Requirement (Legal Certainty):**  
   - Any restriction on fundamental rights must be clearly defined and foreseeable to individuals ("accessible and precise").  
   - The phrase "public order (ordre public)" was deemed too vague and overbroad. While "public order" (in the sense of maintaining law and order) is a legitimate purpose, "ordre public" extends to undefined societal interests (e.g., "the functioning of society" or "fundamental principles of democracy"), which lack clarity.  
   - The Commissioner’s discretion to restrict assemblies for "ordre public" failed the "prescribed by law" test, as it allowed arbitrary enforcement.  

2. **Necessity Requirement (Proportionality):**  
   - Restrictions must be rationally connected to a legitimate purpose and the least restrictive means necessary.  
   - The Court applied a three-part proportionality test:  
     - **Rational Connection:** The restriction must address a legitimate purpose (e.g., public safety).  
     - **Minimal Impairment:** The means used must not exceed what is necessary.  
     - **Proportionality Stricto Sensu:** The benefits of the restriction must outweigh its societal costs.  

#### **B. Severance of Unconstitutional Provisions**  
- The Court severed the problematic "ordre public" element from the statutory provisions (Sections 14(1), 14(5), and 15(2)), leaving "public order" (law and order maintenance) as a valid ground for restrictions.  
- The remaining provisions satisfied both constitutional requirements:  
  - **Legal Certainty:** "Public order" (preventing disorder or threats to safety) is sufficiently clear.  
  - **Proportionality:** The notification requirements and police discretion to impose conditions or object to processions were deemed proportionate, as they balanced public safety with the right to assembly.  

#### **C. Dissenting Opinion (Bokhary PJ)**  
- Argued that **all prior restraint powers** (e.g., banning assemblies or imposing conditions) under the Ordinance were unconstitutional due to their broad, vague standards and lack of judicial oversight.  
- Emphasized that restrictions on fundamental rights like assembly require strict scrutiny and cannot be delegated to executive discretion without clear limits.  
- Advocated striking down the entire scheme, leaving enforcement to post-hoc measures (e.g., dispersing unlawful assemblies) rather than pre-emptive bans.

### 4. Striking or Unusual Aspects of the Case  
1. **First Constitutional Challenge to Hong Kong’s Public Order Laws:**  
   - This was the first time the Court of Final Appeal addressed the constitutionality of Hong Kong’s post-handover public assembly laws, setting a precedent for balancing civil liberties and public order.  

2. **Detailed Analysis of "Ordre Public":**  
   - The Court’s exploration of the imprecision of "ordre public" (a concept borrowed from the ICCPR) highlighted tensions between international human rights standards and local legislative drafting.  

3. **Severance as a Remedy:**  
   - The majority’s use of severance to salvage parts of the Ordinance demonstrated a pragmatic approach to constitutional review, preserving legislative intent while excising unconstitutional elements.  

4. **Dissent’s Radical Stance:**  
   - Bokhary PJ’s dissent rejected all prior restraint powers, aligning with strict free speech principles (e.g., U.S. First Amendment jurisprudence), which contrasted with the majority’s more deferential stance toward public safety.  

5. **Activist Context:**  
   - The case involved prominent pro-democracy activist Leung Kwok Hung, whose deliberate civil disobedience underscored the political stakes of the legal battle over assembly rights in Hong Kong.  

6. **International Comparisons:**  
   - The judgment referenced cases from jurisdictions like the U.S., U.K., Germany, and South Africa, reflecting Hong Kong’s integration into global human rights discourse.  

This case remains a landmark in Hong Kong’s constitutional law, illustrating the judiciary’s role in safeguarding fundamental rights while navigating complex societal interests. [end of text]
