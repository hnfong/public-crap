### 1. Brief Summary of Facts

The appellant, Chan Ming Lok, was convicted of possessing an offensive weapon (a knife) in a public place under section 33(1) of the Public Order Ordinance, Cap. 245. He was apprehended by police officers in Central, Hong Kong, at approximately 2:00 a.m. on 29 June 2008. The officers observed him walking suspiciously in the vicinity of Cochrane Street, Aberdeen Street, and Gutzlaff Street. He was carrying a rucksack and, at times, rested his hand on it. When questioned, he admitted to living in Shenzhen and carrying the knife for self-defence against potential robbery, as he believed public order was poor. He claimed he had brought the knife through customs many times without issue. The magistrate convicted him, finding the knife to be an "offensive weapon" under section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance and that the appellant had no lawful authority or reasonable excuse for its possession. The appellant was sentenced to 6 months' imprisonment. He appealed, arguing that the magistrate misapplied the law regarding the definition of "offensive weapon" under the Public Order Ordinance, particularly concerning the category of weapons "suitable for causing injury to the person" and its compatibility with the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**Appellant (Mr. Wong):**
- Argued that the magistrate misapplied the law by classifying the knife as an "offensive weapon" under section 2(c) of the Public Order Ordinance, which defines such weapons as those "suitable for causing injury to the person."
- Contended that, under *R v. Chong Ah Choi & Others* [1994] 2 HKCLR 263, the definition in section 2(c) might need to be interpreted in light of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, Cap. 383, potentially excluding category (c) and leaving only three categories (a), (b), and (d).
- Submitted that the magistrate's finding that the knife was an offensive weapon was based on an incorrect legal premise, as the appellant did not intend to use the knife offensively in Hong Kong.

**Respondent (Miss Lam for the Secretary of Justice):**
- Initially, the Secretary of Justice accepted that category (c) might no longer be valid under the Bill of Rights, but did not pursue this argument.
- Argued that the magistrate's findings were clear and that the appellant's admission of carrying the knife for self-defence in Shenzhen constituted an intention to use it as a weapon, even if only for self-defence.
- Contended that the magistrate correctly found the knife to be an offensive weapon and that the appellant had no lawful authority or reasonable excuse for its possession.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The case primarily revolves around the interpretation and application of section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance, Cap. 245, which defines "offensive weapons." The key legal principles are:

**a. Definition of "Offensive Weapon":**
- Section 2 of the Public Order Ordinance defines "offensive weapons" as any article:
  - (a) made for causing injury to the person;
  - (b) adapted for use for causing injury to the person;
  - (c) suitable for causing injury to the person; or
  - (d) intended by the person having it for use for causing injury to the person.
- The case highlights the ambiguity and potential overbreadth of category (c), "suitable for causing injury to the person," which criminalizes items that are not inherently weapons but could be used to cause harm.

**b. Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance, Cap. 383:**
- The appellant argued that category (c) might be incompatible with the Bill of Rights, which guarantees the right to privacy and freedom of movement. The Court of Appeal in *Chong Ah Choi* suggested that category (c) might need to be construed narrowly to avoid violating these rights.
- The Secretary of Justice conceded that category (c) might no longer be tenable under the Bill of Rights, but this was not pursued as a formal argument.

**c. Magistrate's Findings:**
- The magistrate found the knife to be an offensive weapon under section 2(c) based on its sharpness and potential to cause injury, without explicitly stating which category she relied on.
- The magistrate rejected the appellant's argument that he had no intention to use the knife offensively in Hong Kong, holding that his admission of carrying it for self-defence in Shenzhen was sufficient to establish an intention to use it as a weapon.

**d. Appeal on Sentence:**
- The appeal was allowed on sentence, reducing the term from 6 months to 4 months. The court noted that while the sentence was not manifestly excessive, a shorter term was appropriate given the appellant's lack of prior convictions and the circumstances of the case.

**e. Legal Principle on Possession of Offensive Weapons:**
- The case establishes that possession of an offensive weapon in a public place is a strict liability offence under section 33(1) of the Public Order Ordinance. The prosecution does not need to prove an intent to use the weapon offensively; possession alone is sufficient.
- The court emphasized that the law takes a strict view of carrying offensive weapons, even for self-defence, as public safety is paramount.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

- **Ambiguity in the Definition of "Offensive Weapon":** The case underscores the problematic nature of category (c) in the definition of "offensive weapons," which criminalizes items based on their potential to cause harm rather than their inherent nature or intent to use. This has led to calls for legislative amendment, as noted by the court.
- **Bill of Rights Compatibility:** The potential incompatibility of category (c) with the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance is a significant legal issue, though the court did not ultimately rule on it. The fact that the Secretary of Justice conceded this point is notable, suggesting a possible future challenge to the law.
- **Strict Liability Offence:** The case highlights the harshness of strict liability offences under the Public Order Ordinance, where possession alone is sufficient for conviction, regardless of intent or reasonable excuse. The court acknowledged this but upheld the conviction, emphasizing public safety.
- **Circumstantial Evidence and Credibility:** The magistrate's findings on the appellant's credibility and the circumstances of his possession (e.g., working as a chef nearby) are striking. Despite the appellant's claim of carrying the knife for self-defence in Shenzhen, the court focused on his admission and the potential for harm, rather than the lack of immediate threat in Hong Kong.
- **Disproportionate Sentence:** The reduction of the sentence from 6 to 4 months, while modest, reflects the court's recognition of mitigating factors, though the original sentence was already within the statutory maximum. This highlights the tension between deterrence and proportionality in sentencing for such offences.

### Final Thoughts

This case is remarkable for its exploration of the boundaries of the "offensive weapons" definition under Hong Kong law, particularly in light of human rights considerations. While the court ultimately upheld the conviction, the discussion around category (c) and its potential inconsistency with the Bill of Rights adds a layer of complexity and controversy to the decision. The case also serves as a stark reminder of the strict liability nature of weapon possession offences and the judiciary's prioritization of public safety over individual circumstances.
