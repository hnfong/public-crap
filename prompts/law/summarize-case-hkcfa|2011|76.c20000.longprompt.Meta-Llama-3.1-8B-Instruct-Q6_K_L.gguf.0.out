**Summary of Facts**

The case of Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v Chan Chun Chuen and Another (2011) involves a dispute over the validity of a will left by Nina Wang, a wealthy businesswoman who died in 2007. The Chinachem Charitable Foundation, which was named as the beneficiary in Wang's 2002 will, sought to have the court pronounce in solemn form the force and validity of the 2002 will. The Applicant, Chan Chun Chuen, claimed that the 2002 will was invalid and that the 2006 will, which he propounded, was the valid will of Nina Wang. The Applicant sought an order declaring the validity of the 2006 will. After a 40-day trial, the trial judge, Lam J, found that the 2006 will was a forgery. The Applicant's appeal to the Court of Appeal was dismissed, and he then applied to the Court of Final Appeal for leave to appeal. The Applicant claimed that he was entitled to leave to appeal as of right under section 22(1)(a) of the Court's statute, which provides for appeals to be heard by the Court of Final Appeal in certain circumstances.

**Summary of Arguments**

The Applicant argued that he was entitled to leave to appeal as of right under section 22(1)(a) because the appeal involved a claim to property or a proprietary right worth over $1 million. The Applicant relied on two Court of Appeal decisions, Wang Din Shin v Nina Kung and Re Estate of Mui Yim Fong (No 2), which held that an action for a pronouncement against the validity of a will could be considered an indirect claim to the property constituting the estate. The Applicant also argued that the Court of Appeal's review of the trial judge's findings was inadequate, and that the Court of Final Appeal should review the findings of fact. The Applicant further argued that the Court of Final Appeal should consider new evidence that had come to light, which he claimed undermined the credibility of a crucial witness, Winfield Wong.

The Respondent, the Chinachem Charitable Foundation, argued that the Applicant was not entitled to leave to appeal as of right because the appeal did not involve a claim to a particular property or proprietary right. The Respondent also argued that the Court of Appeal's review of the trial judge's findings was adequate and that the Court of Final Appeal should not review the findings of fact. The Respondent further argued that the new evidence relied on by the Applicant was not sufficient to undermine the credibility of Winfield Wong and that the Applicant's application for leave to appeal should be dismissed.

**Summary of Legal Principles**

The Court of Final Appeal held that the Applicant was not entitled to leave to appeal as of right under section 22(1)(a) because the appeal did not involve a claim to a particular property or proprietary right. The Court held that the words "some claim or question to or respecting property or some civil right" in section 22(1)(a) required a claim to a particular property or proprietary right, and that an action for a pronouncement against the validity of a will did not satisfy this requirement.

The Court also held that the Court of Appeal's review of the trial judge's findings was adequate and that the Court of Final Appeal should not review the findings of fact. The Court noted that it had a firmly established practice of not reviewing concurrent findings of fact unless there was a miscarriage of justice or a violation of some principle of law or procedure. The Court held that the Applicant had not shown any reasonably arguable grounds for questioning this practice.

The Court also considered the Applicant's argument that the Court of Final Appeal should consider new evidence that had come to light, which he claimed undermined the credibility of Winfield Wong. The Court held that the new evidence was not sufficient to undermine the credibility of Winfield Wong and that the Applicant's application for leave to appeal should be dismissed.

The Court also noted that the "as of right" basis for appeals to the Court of Final Appeal should be reconsidered, as it was an anomaly in modern legal systems and was not in line with the practice of other final appellate courts. The Court suggested that the right of appeal should be abolished.

The Court's decision was based on the following legal principles:

* The Court of Final Appeal has a firmly established practice of not reviewing concurrent findings of fact unless there is a miscarriage of justice or a violation of some principle of law or procedure.
* The words "some claim or question to or respecting property or some civil right" in section 22(1)(a) require a claim to a particular property or proprietary right.
* An action for a pronouncement against the validity of a will does not satisfy the requirement of a claim to a particular property or proprietary right.
* The Court of Appeal's review of the trial judge's findings is adequate and should not be disturbed.
* The Court of Final Appeal should not review the findings of fact unless there is a miscarriage of justice or a violation of some principle of law or procedure.
* The "as of right" basis for appeals to the Court of Final Appeal should be reconsidered and abolished.

These principles are novel and controversial in the sense that they establish a clear and strict approach to the review of concurrent findings of fact and the interpretation of section 22(1)(a) of the Court's statute. They also suggest that the "as of right" basis for appeals to the Court of Final Appeal is an anomaly in modern legal systems and should be abolished. [end of text]
