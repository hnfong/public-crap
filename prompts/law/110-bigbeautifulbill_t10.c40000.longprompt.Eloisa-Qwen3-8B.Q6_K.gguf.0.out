Okay, the user wants a summary of every section in this big bill, starting with Sec. 100001. The bill is about immigration fees and funding, so I need to go through each section and condense the key points into one paragraph with up to four sentences. 

First, I'll look at Sec. 100001. It's about the applicability of immigration laws and defines terms. I need to mention that it sets the stage for the fees in the subtitle and references the Immigration and Nationality Act. 

Next, Sec. 100002 is about the asylum fee. The user probably wants to know the initial amount, how it adjusts for inflation, and who collects the fees. I should note the $100 initial fee, the annual adjustments, and the split between the Attorney General and DHS.

Sec. 100003 deals with employment authorization fees for asylum applicants. The initial fee is $550, and there are inflation adjustments. I need to highlight the fee structure, who collects it, and how the funds are distributed.

Sec. 100007 is the visa integrity fee, initially $250. I'll note the fee and its purpose.

Sec. 100008 is the Form I-94 fee, starting at $24. I should mention the fee and its use.

Sec. 100009 is the annual asylum fee, $100 initially. I'll note the fee and its purpose.

Sec. 100010 is for renewal of employment authorization for parolees, $275. I need to mention the fee and its distribution.

Sec. 100011 is for renewal of employment authorization for asylum applicants, $275. I'll note the fee and its distribution.

Sec. 100012 is for renewal of employment authorization for TPS holders, $275. I should mention the fee and its distribution.

Sec. 100013 covers various adjustment of status fees, with different amounts for different applications. I'll note the fees and their purposes.

Sec. 100014 is the ESTA fee, initially $13. I need to mention the fee and its adjustments.

Sec. 100015 is the EVUS fee, starting at $30. I'll note the fee and its distribution.

Sec. 100016 is the removal in absentia fee, $5,000. I should mention the fee and its distribution.

Sec. 100017 is the inadmissible alien apprehension fee, $5,000. I'll note the fee and its distribution.

Sec. 100018 amends the asylum application process to require a fee. I need to mention the change from "may" to "shall" and the fee reference.

Then, the funding sections start with Sec. 100051 for DHS, which includes hiring and training. I'll note the appropriation amounts and purposes.

Sec. 100052 is for USCIS, with performance bonuses and hiring. I should mention the funds and their uses.

Sec. 100053 is for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers, with training and facility funds.

Sec. 100054 is for DOJ, including immigration court staffing and combating drug trafficking.

Sec. 100055 is the Bridging Fund for state reimbursements.

Sec. 100056 is for the Bureau of Prisons, with salaries and facilities.

Sec. 100057 is for the Secret Service, with bonuses and personnel.

Subtitle B includes appropriations for the Administrative Office of the Courts and the Federal Judicial Center.

Subtitle C covers radiation compensation, extending the fund and adjusting claims.

I need to ensure each summary is concise, specific, and includes all key details like amounts, parties involved, and purposes. I'll avoid vague terms and stick to the facts from the bill text. Also, I should check that I'm not missing any sections and that each summary is within the four-sentence limit. Let me go through each section one by one and draft the summaries accordingly.
