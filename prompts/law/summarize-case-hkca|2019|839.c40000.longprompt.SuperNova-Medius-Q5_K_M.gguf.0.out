### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case involves seven police officers (D1 to D7) who were convicted of assaulting Tsang Kin Chiu, a protester, during the "Occupy Central" movement in Hong Kong in 2014. The incident occurred on October 15, 2014, when the police were clearing protesters from Lung Wo Road in Admiralty. Tsang was initially restrained and then carried face down to a substation, where he was allegedly assaulted by the seven officers. Tsang was later taken to Central Police Station, where he was slapped by one of the officers (D5) during an interview. The officers were convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault, and sentenced to two years' imprisonment (except for D5, who received an additional one month for the common assault).

### 2. Arguments of the Two Parties

**Defendants' Arguments:**
- **Admissibility of Video Evidence:** The defendants argued that the judge erred in admitting video recordings and photographs into evidence without sufficient proof of their authenticity. They contended that the standard of proof for authenticity should be on the balance of probabilities, not prima facie.
- **Identification of Appellants:** The defendants challenged the identification of the officers involved in the assault, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to establish their presence at the scene beyond a reasonable doubt.
- **Sentence:** The defendants argued that the sentences were manifestly excessive, given their long and distinguished careers in the police force and the stressful conditions they were under during the protests.

**Respondent's Arguments:**
- **Admissibility of Video Evidence:** The respondent argued that the judge correctly applied the test for admissibility of video evidence, which required a prima facie case of authenticity. The respondent contended that the evidence was sufficient to establish the authenticity of the video recordings and photographs beyond a reasonable doubt.
- **Identification of Appellants:** The respondent argued that the judge's identification of the officers involved in the assault was correct, based on the evidence from various video recordings and photographs.
- **Sentence:** The respondent argued that the sentences were appropriate, given the serious nature of the offenses and the need to maintain public confidence in the police force.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**Admissibility of Video Evidence:**
- The court held that the correct test for the admissibility of video recorded evidence is whether it is prima facie authentic, not whether it is proven on the balance of probabilities. The court rejected the argument that the prosecution must prove the authenticity of video recordings on the balance of probabilities.
- The court found that the judge correctly applied the test for admissibility by considering whether the video recordings were relevant and prima facie authentic. The judge ultimately found that the prosecution had proved the authenticity of the video recordings beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Identification of Appellants:**
- The court held that the judge's identification of the appellants from the video recordings and photographs was correct. The court found that the evidence was sufficient to establish the presence of the appellants at the scene beyond a reasonable doubt.
- The court emphasized the importance of the context in which the events occurred, noting that the officers were part of a specific team (QRT A2-2) and that the sequence of events was consistent with their involvement in the assault.

**Sentence:**
- The court held that the sentences imposed on the appellants were manifestly excessive. The court found that the starting point for the sentences should have been lower, taking into account the stressful conditions the officers were under during the protests.
- The court also held that the sentence for the common assault charge against D5 should have been ordered to run consecutively to the sentence for the main charge, not concurrently.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case

- **Use of Open-Source Video Evidence:** The case highlights the increasing use of open-source video evidence in criminal trials, particularly in cases involving protests and civil unrest. The court's ruling on the admissibility of such evidence sets an important precedent for future cases.
- **Identification of Police Officers:** The case demonstrates the challenges of identifying police officers involved in an assault, especially when they are part of a larger team and the evidence is primarily visual. The court's detailed analysis of the video recordings and photographs provides a useful framework for future cases involving similar identification issues.
- **Sentencing of Police Officers:** The case underscores the importance of maintaining public confidence in the police force, particularly in cases where police officers are accused of misconduct. The court's decision to reduce the sentences reflects a balance between the need for deterrence and the unique circumstances of the case.
- **Production Order Ruling:** The case highlights the potential consequences of a judge's decision to refuse a production order for video recordings, even when such recordings are clearly relevant to the case. The court's criticism of the initial ruling by Barnes J suggests that such decisions should be carefully reconsidered in future cases.
- **Complexity of the Case:** The case involved a large number of appellants, multiple grounds of appeal, and a detailed factual analysis. The court's decision to allow some appeals and dismiss others reflects the complexity of the case and the need for a nuanced approach to the evidence and legal principles involved. 

Overall, the case is remarkable for its detailed examination of the use of video evidence, identification issues, and the sentencing of police officers involved in a high-profile incident. The court's decision provides important guidance for future cases involving similar issues. [end of text]
