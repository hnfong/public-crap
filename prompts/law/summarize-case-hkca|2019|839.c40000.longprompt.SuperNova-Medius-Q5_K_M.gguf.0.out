### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case of HKSAR v Wong Cho Shing and Others [2019] HKCA 839 involved seven police officers (D1 to D7) who were convicted of assaulting Tsang Kin Chiu, a protester, during the "Occupy Central" movement in Hong Kong in 2014. The incident occurred on 15 October 2014, when the police were clearing protesters from Lung Wo Road in Admiralty. Tsang was seen splashing liquid onto the police, leading to his arrest and subsequent assault.

The prosecution relied on video recordings and photographs from various news agencies and social media to establish the identity of the officers involved in the assault. The trial judge admitted these video recordings and photographs into evidence, finding them to be relevant and authentic. The judge identified the appellants as part of the group that assaulted Tsang at the Substation and convicted them accordingly.

The case involved a detailed examination of the video recordings and photographs, as well as the identification of the appellants. The prosecution argued that the video evidence was sufficient to establish the guilt of the appellants, while the defense challenged the authenticity and admissibility of the video recordings and photographs.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments

**Appellants' Arguments:**

1. **Admissibility of Video Evidence:** The appellants argued that the judge erred in admitting the video recordings and photographs into evidence. They contended that the prosecution had not met the threshold of proving the authenticity of the evidence on the balance of probabilities. The appellants also argued that the judge's reliance on the video evidence was flawed because the original video recordings were not produced at trial.

2. **Identification of Appellants:** The appellants challenged the identification of themselves in the video recordings and photographs. They argued that the judge's identification of them was unsafe and that there was insufficient evidence to establish their presence at the scene of the assault.

3. **Sentence:** The appellants argued that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive, given their long and distinguished careers in the police force and the unique circumstances of the "Occupy Central" movement.

**Respondent's Arguments:**

1. **Admissibility of Video Evidence:** The respondent argued that the judge correctly applied the test for admissibility of video evidence, which required the prosecution to establish a prima facie case of authenticity. The respondent contended that the judge's finding that the video recordings and photographs were authentic beyond reasonable doubt was correct.

2. **Identification of Appellants:** The respondent argued that the judge's identification of the appellants was correct and that the evidence was sufficient to establish their presence at the scene of the assault. The respondent also argued that the judge's identification of the appellants was based on a careful examination of the video recordings and photographs.

3. **Sentence:** The respondent argued that the sentences imposed were appropriate, given the seriousness of the offense and the need to maintain public confidence in the police force.

### 3. Summary of the Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**Admissibility of Video Evidence:**

The Court held that the correct test for the admissibility of video recorded evidence is whether the prosecution has established a prima facie case of authenticity. The Court rejected the argument that the prosecution must prove the authenticity of the video recordings on the balance of probabilities. Instead, the Court held that the prosecution must establish a prima facie case of authenticity, which can be done by circumstantial evidence.

The Court also held that the judge's identification of the video recordings as authentic beyond reasonable doubt was correct. The Court found that the evidence of the video recordings and photographs was sufficient to establish a prima facie case of authenticity, and that the judge's finding that the evidence was authentic beyond reasonable doubt was correct.

**Identification of Appellants:**

The Court held that the identification of the appellants in the video recordings and photographs was correct. The Court found that the judge's identification of the appellants was based on a careful examination of the video recordings and photographs, and that the evidence was sufficient to establish their presence at the scene of the assault.

The Court also held that the identification of D4 and D7 was unsafe and unsatisfactory. The Court found that there was no identification of D4 and D7 by any witness in the video recordings or photographs, and that the evidence linking them to the assault was too tenuous to establish their participation beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Sentence:**

The Court held that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. The Court found that the starting point for the sentences should have been lower, and that the reduction for the appellants' records and careers was appropriate. The Court also held that the sentence for D5 on Charge 2 should have been ordered to run consecutively to the sentence on Charge 1.

**Key Points:**

1. **Prima Facie Authenticity:** The Court held that the prosecution must establish a prima facie case of authenticity for video recorded evidence to be admitted into evidence. This is a lower standard than proving authenticity on the balance of probabilities.

2. **Circumstantial Evidence:** The Court held that authenticity can be proved circumstantially, and that the judge's finding that the video recordings and photographs were authentic beyond reasonable doubt was correct.

3. **Identification of Appellants:** The Court held that the identification of the appellants in the video recordings and photographs was correct, but that the identification of D4 and D7 was unsafe and unsatisfactory.

4. **Sentence:** The Court held that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive, and that the starting point for the sentences should have been lower.

These legal principles are significant because they clarify the standard of proof required for the admissibility of video recorded evidence and the importance of a careful examination of the evidence in identification cases. The Court's decision also highlights the need for a fair and balanced approach to sentencing, taking into account the unique circumstances of the case and the appellants' records and careers.
