**Sec. 30001. Funding cap for the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.**  
The funding cap for the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection is reduced from $12 billion to $6.5 billion annually, effective immediately. This change limits the bureau’s budget authority, impacting its ability to regulate financial products and enforce consumer protections. The adjustment affects the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. The change is part of broader efforts to reduce federal regulatory spending.

**Sec. 30002. Rescission of funds for Green and Resilient Retrofit Program for Multifamily Housing.**  
Unobligated funds allocated to the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program for Multifamily Housing, previously authorized in 2022, are rescinded. This means no further spending can occur on this program, which aimed to improve energy efficiency in multifamily housing. The rescission reflects a shift in federal priorities toward other housing initiatives.

**Sec. 30003. Securities and Exchange Commission Reserve Fund.**  
The Securities and Exchange Commission Reserve Fund is restructured, with subsections (j) and (k) renamed to (i) and (j). The fund is now available indefinitely for whistleblower awards without annual appropriations. By October 1, 2025, remaining balances will be transferred to the Treasury, and the fund will be closed. This change ensures continued support for whistleblowers while ending the fund’s existence.

**Sec. 30004. Appropriations for Defense Production Act.**  
An additional $1 billion is appropriated for fiscal year 2025 under the Defense Production Act, available until September 30, 2027. This funding supports domestic production of critical materials and technologies, enhancing national security and supply chain resilience. The funds are intended to bolster industries vital to defense and economic stability. [end of text]
