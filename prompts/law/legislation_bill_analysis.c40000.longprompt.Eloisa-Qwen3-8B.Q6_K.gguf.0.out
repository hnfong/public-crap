Okay, I need to answer these questions about the Protection of Critical Infrastructures (Computer Systems) Bill. Let me start by reading through the bill carefully to understand its contents.

First, the bill's purpose is to protect the computer systems of Hong Kong's critical infrastructures, regulate their operators, and provide for investigations and responses to computer-system security threats and incidents. The major themes include cybersecurity measures, regulatory oversight, compliance obligations for operators, incident reporting, and legal enforcement mechanisms.

For Question B, the legislation impacts CI operators, designated authorities, regulating authorities, and organizations involved in critical infrastructures. Those who need to be familiar with it include legal professionals, compliance officers, IT managers, and policymakers. Concerned parties would be anyone involved in critical infrastructure operations, cybersecurity professionals, and the public interested in data protection.

Question C asks about new obligations and rights. The bill imposes obligations on CI operators to maintain offices, notify changes, set up security units, conduct risk assessments, and report incidents. It grants powers to regulating authorities to issue directions, codes of practice, and conduct investigations. Designated authorities also have specific functions.

For Question D, liabilities include civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with obligations, failure to report incidents, and obstructing investigations. Conditions for these liabilities include specific acts like failing to submit required documents, not complying with directions, or engaging in unauthorized activities. Criminal liabilities involve offenses like failing to notify incidents or obstructing investigations, with penalties ranging from fines to imprisonment.
