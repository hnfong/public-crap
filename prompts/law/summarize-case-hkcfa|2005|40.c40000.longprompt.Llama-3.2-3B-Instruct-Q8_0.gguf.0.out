**Facts of the Case**

The case of Leung Kwok Hung and Others v. HKSAR (2005) HKCFA 40; [2005] 3 HKLRD 164; (2005) 8 HKCFAR 229; FACC 1/2005 (8 July 2005) involves a challenge to the constitutionality of the statutory scheme for the regulation of public processions contained in the Public Order Ordinance, Cap. 245. The scheme allows the Commissioner of Police to restrict the right of peaceful assembly for the purpose of "public order (ordre public)". The appellants, Leung Kwok Hung, Chan Wai Ho, and Chan Wai Man, were convicted of holding an unauthorized assembly and assisting in the holding of an unauthorized assembly, respectively. The unauthorized assembly was a public procession that took place on February 10, 2002, in Chater Garden, Hong Kong.

**Arguments of the Parties**

The appellants, represented by Mr. Martin Lee SC and Mr. Erik Shum, argued that the statutory scheme for the regulation of public processions is unconstitutional because it gives the Commissioner of Police too wide a discretion to restrict the right of peaceful assembly for the purpose of "public order (ordre public)". They claimed that the concept of "public order (ordre public)" is too vague and uncertain, and that the scheme does not provide sufficient safeguards to protect the right of peaceful assembly.

The respondent, represented by Mr. Gerard McCoy SC, argued that the statutory scheme is constitutional and that the concept of "public order (ordre public)" is not as vague as the appellants claimed. He submitted that the scheme provides sufficient safeguards to protect the right of peaceful assembly and that the Commissioner of Police has a reasonable discretion to restrict the right of peaceful assembly for the purpose of "public order (ordre public)".

**Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The Court's decision in this case establishes several important legal principles regarding the regulation of public processions and the right of peaceful assembly.

1. **Freedom of Peaceful Assembly**: The Court reaffirmed the importance of the right of peaceful assembly, which is closely associated with the freedom of speech. The right of peaceful assembly is a fundamental right that is essential to a democratic society, and it must be protected by the law.
2. **Necessity Requirement**: The Court held that any restriction on the right of peaceful assembly must be necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order (ordre public), the protection of public health or morals, or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. The Court applied a proportionality test to determine whether the restriction is necessary and whether it is no more than is necessary to accomplish the legitimate purpose.
3. **Proportionality Test**: The Court established that the proportionality test must be applied to determine whether the restriction on the right of peaceful assembly is necessary and whether it is no more than is necessary to accomplish the legitimate purpose. The test involves considering whether the restriction is rationally connected with one or more of the statutory legitimate purposes and whether the means used to impair the right of peaceful assembly are no more than is necessary to accomplish the legitimate purpose.
4. **Prescribed by Law Requirement**: The Court held that the statutory discretion to restrict the right of peaceful assembly for the purpose of "public order (ordre public)" does not satisfy the constitutional requirement of "prescribed by law". The concept of "public order (ordre public)" is too vague and uncertain, and the scheme does not provide sufficient safeguards to protect the right of peaceful assembly.
5. **Separation of Powers**: The Court emphasized the importance of separating the powers of the executive authorities from the judiciary, and it held that the Commissioner of Police's powers of prior restraint are unconstitutional because they are too broad and lack sufficient safeguards to protect the right of peaceful assembly.
6. **Judicial Review**: The Court established that the Commissioner of Police's powers of prior restraint are subject to judicial review, and it held that the Court has the power to strike down the provisions of the Public Order Ordinance that are unconstitutional.

Overall, the Court's decision in this case establishes an important precedent for the regulation of public processions and the right of peaceful assembly in Hong Kong, and it highlights the importance of protecting fundamental rights and freedoms in a democratic society. [end of text]
