Hmm, the user has provided a lengthy legal judgment from the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal and asked me to analyze it through four specific tasks. This appears to be a complex probate case involving a disputed will of Nina Wang, a prominent Hong Kong billionaire.

First, I need to understand the core dispute. After Nina Wang's death in 2007, two wills surfaced: a 2002 will leaving everything to a charitable foundation, and a 2006 will leaving everything to Chan Chun Chuen. The foundation sued to validate the 2002 will and declare the 2006 will a forgery, while Chan counterclaimed to validate the 2006 will. Both lower courts found the 2006 will was forged.

Now for the tasks: For the facts, I'll focus on the competing wills, the forgery finding, and Chan's appeal to the final court. The arguments section needs to contrast Chan's position (seeking automatic appeal rights based on estate value) versus the foundation's position (arguing no automatic right exists). 

The legal principles are the most complex part. The court provides an exhaustive analysis of when appeals can be brought "as of right" under Hong Kong law. Key points include: the narrow interpretation of appeal rights, the "immediacy requirement" for financial impact, and the strict approach to reviewing concurrent factual findings. This seems novel in how it modernizes Hong Kong's appeal framework away from outdated Commonwealth models.

For striking aspects, several things stand out: The astronomical value of the estate (billions), the dramatic finding that a will benefiting a feng shui master was forged, and the court's unusual suggestion to abolish automatic appeal rights altogether - quite progressive for a final court.

The user seems legally sophisticated given how they framed the query. Probably a law student or practitioner studying Hong Kong civil procedure or probate law. They'll appreciate careful attention to the nuanced appeal criteria and the court's policy reasoning. I should emphasize how this case tightens appeal access while acknowledging the extraordinary circumstances surrounding one of Asia's largest fortunes.

I notice the court spends significant time distinguishing "partial will" versus "complete will" evidence - crucial for the forgery finding. Also noteworthy is how they handle the fresh evidence application about witness credibility. The dismissal seems thorough but fair.

The historical context matters too - this continues the famous Wang family saga involving kidnapping and earlier probate battles. While not part of the legal ratio, it explains why the courts were extra vigilant about forgery claims.

### 1. Summary of Facts  
After the death of billionaire Nina Wang in 2007, a probate dispute arose between the Chinachem Charitable Foundation (Foundation) and Chan Chun Chuen (Applicant). The Foundation sought validation of Wang’s 2002 will, which named it as the sole beneficiary. Chan propounded a 2006 will naming himself as the sole beneficiary. The authenticity of the 2002 will was undisputed, but the 2006 will was alleged to be a forgery. After a 40-day trial, the High Court (Lam J) found the 2006 will forged. The Court of Appeal upheld this decision. Chan then applied to the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) for leave to appeal, which was dismissed.  

### 2. Summary of Arguments  
**Applicant (Chan Chun Chuen):**  
- Sought leave to appeal "as of right" under *Section 22(1)(a)* of the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal Ordinance, arguing the appeal involved property worth over HK$1 million.  
- Alternatively, sought *discretionary leave* under *Section 22(1)(b)*, claiming the case raised questions of "great general or public importance" (e.g., challenging the CFA’s practice of deferring to concurrent factual findings).  
- Argued the lower courts inadequately addressed "inherent improbabilities" of forgery and sought to introduce fresh police statements to discredit a key witness (Winfield Wong).  

**Respondents (Foundation and DOJ):**  
- Opposed "as of right" leave, contending probate actions are not direct claims to property and failed the "immediacy requirement" (financial impact must be direct/quantifiable).  
- Argued discretionary leave was unwarranted: no novel legal issues existed, concurrent factual findings were sound, and fresh evidence was inconsequential.  
- Emphasized the CFA’s role as a court of final appeal for legal—not factual—reviews.  

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
#### **I. Leave to Appeal "As of Right" (Section 22(1)(a))**  
The CFA reaffirmed a **strict, narrow interpretation** of automatic appeal rights:  
- **Property/Right Requirement**: The appeal must involve a *direct or indirect claim to specific property or a proprietary right* (e.g., a trust beneficiary claim). Mere connection to valuable property is insufficient.  
- **Immediacy Requirement**: The CFA’s order must *immediately* confer a quantifiable financial benefit/detriment of ≥HK$1 million *without further adjudication*. Probate actions fail this test if validity rulings require additional steps (e.g., construing competing wills).  
- **Threshold Value**: The value must be "clearly quantifiable" at ≥HK$1 million. Unliquidated claims (e.g., damages) are excluded.  
- **Probate Exception**: While prior cases (*Wang Din-shin*, *Mui Yim Fong*) allowed "as of right" appeals where the winner takes the *entire estate*, this case differed: Issue 9 (whether the 2006 will revoked the 2002 will) required further construction, negating immediacy.  

#### **II. Discretionary Leave (Section 22(1)(b))**  
The CFA outlined stringent criteria for discretionary leave:  
- **Great General/Public Importance**: The question must transcend the parties’ interests (e.g., systemic legal principles). Chan’s challenge to the *concurrent findings practice* was rejected as unarguable.  
- **"Or Otherwise" Ground**: Reserved for "highly exceptional" cases where injustice might occur. Chan’s attacks on the Court of Appeal’s factual review and fresh evidence were deemed meritless.  
- **Concurrent Findings Practice**: The CFA **upheld its practice** of refusing to review concurrent factual findings absent:  
  - A miscarriage of justice;  
  - Violation of legal/procedural principles; or  
  - Exceptional circumstances (e.g., perverse findings).  
Policy justifications included:  
  - Finality in litigation and resource efficiency;  
  - Respect for lower courts’ fact-finding role;  
  - Avoiding "third-tier" factual re-examinations.  

#### **III. Treatment of Fresh Evidence**  
The CFA applied the *Ladd v Marshall* criteria:  
- Evidence must be **unavailable at trial**, **credible**, and **decisive**.  
- Chan’s police statements from Winfield Wong were rejected:  
  - They did not materially contradict Wong’s trial testimony about the 2006 will being a "partial will" (key to forgery findings).  
  - Alleged discrepancies (e.g., beneficiary’s name) were peripheral and did not undermine the core factual findings.  

### 4. Striking/Unusual Aspects  
1. **Historic Wealth at Stake**: Nina Wang’s estate was worth billions (HK), making this one of Asia’s most high-value probate disputes.  
2. **Dramatic Forgery Findings**: The courts concluded Chan forged a will to inherit a vast fortune—a rare, high-stakes fraud allegation.  
3. **Critique of "As of Right" Appeals**: The CFA **unusually recommended abolishing automatic appeals** (a colonial-era relic), noting modern jurisdictions (UK, Australia, Canada) had discarded them to prioritize substantive legal issues.  
4. **Witness Intrigue**: Key witness Winfield Wong’s credibility was central. His police statements—allegedly "recanting" testimony—were scrutinized but ultimately dismissed, highlighting the courts’ reluctance to reopen factual disputes.  
5. **Judicial Boldness**: The CFA openly challenged the legislature to reform appeal rights, signaling frustration with procedural tactics in mega-wealth cases. [end of text]
