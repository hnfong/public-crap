### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts

The case **Leung Kwok Hung and Others v. HKSAR** concerns the constitutionality of Hong Kong's **Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245)**, specifically its provisions regulating public processions and meetings. The appellants—**Leung Kwok Hung** and two others—were convicted under **Section 17A(3)(b)(i)** of the Ordinance for organizing an **unauthorized assembly** (a public procession) on **10 February 2002**, without prior notification to the Commissioner of Police. The procession, consisting of about 96 people, was a peaceful protest against the conviction of an activist. The police had warned the organizers about the notification requirement, but the organizers refused to comply, leading to the prosecution.

The **Court of First Instance** convicted the appellants, and the **Court of Appeal** upheld the convictions. The appellants then appealed to the **Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal (CFA)**, arguing that the statutory scheme for regulating public processions was unconstitutional because it gave the Commissioner of Police **unfettered discretion** to restrict the right to peaceful assembly under the guise of "public order (ordre public)"—a concept deemed too vague and uncertain under the Basic Law and the **International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)**.

### 2. Arguments of the Two Parties

#### **Appellants (Leung Kwok Hung and Others)**
- **Constitutional Challenge**: Argued that the Ordinance's provisions allowing the Commissioner of Police to restrict public processions for "public order (ordre public)" were **unconstitutional** because the concept was **too vague and uncertain**, violating the **prescribed by law** requirement under **Article 39(2) of the Basic Law** and **Article 21 of the ICCPR**.
- **Proportionality and Necessity**: Contended that the restrictions were not **necessary in a democratic society** and lacked **proportionality**, as they allowed **prior restraint** (banning or imposing conditions on assemblies) without sufficient safeguards.
- **Severance Argument**: Proposed that the word "public order" should be **severed** from "public order (ordre public)" in the statute, leaving only the **clearer concept of "public order"** (in the law-and-order sense) intact, which would be constitutional.

#### **Respondent (HKSAR Government)**
- **Statutory Validity**: Argued that the Ordinance was a **reasonable and necessary** regulation of public order, designed to balance the right to assembly with **public safety, order, and the rights of others**.
- **Proportionality Test**: Submitted that the Commissioner’s discretion was **not arbitrary** but subject to **judicial review** and **appeal mechanisms**, and that the **proportionality test** was satisfied because the restrictions were **rationally connected** to legitimate purposes (e.g., preventing violence or disruption).
- **Read-Down Proposal**: Proposed reading "public order (ordre public)" as limited to **"serious disruption to the life of the community"** or **Article 20 (hate speech prohibitions)** of the ICCPR, but the Court rejected these interpretations.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) – Detailed Analysis

#### **A. Constitutional Framework for Restrictions on Assembly**
- **Article 27 & 39 of the Basic Law**: Guarantees **freedom of assembly** and requires restrictions to be **"prescribed by law"** and **"necessary in a democratic society"** (aligning with **Article 21 of the ICCPR**).
- **Article 17 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (BORO)**: Mirrors **Article 21 of the ICCPR**, specifying that restrictions must be **"necessary in a democratic society"** for specified purposes (national security, public safety, public order, etc.).

#### **B. The "Prescribed by Law" Requirement**
- **Legal Certainty**: Laws restricting fundamental rights must be **sufficiently precise** to allow citizens to regulate their conduct (per **Shum Kwok Sher v. HKSAR**).
- **Vagueness Doctrine**: The **"public order (ordre public)"** concept was deemed **too imprecise** for executive discretion (per **Ng Kung Siu** and **Gurung Kesh Bahadur**). The Court emphasized that **"public order"** (in the law-and-order sense) was acceptable, but **"ordre public"** (a broader, moral/societal concept) was not.

#### **C. The Necessity and Proportionality Test**
- **Proportionality Principle**: Restrictions must be **no more than necessary** to achieve their purpose (per **De Freitas v. Ministry of Agriculture** and **R v. Oakes**).
- **Positive Duty on Government**: The state must **facilitate** peaceful assemblies, not just restrict them (per **Plattform ‘Ärzte für das Leben’ v. Austria**).
- **Limited Discretion**: The Commissioner’s power was **not arbitrary** but constrained by:
  - **Statutory time limits** for objections/conditions.
  - **Duty to give reasons** (must show proportionality).
  - **Appeal and judicial review** mechanisms.

#### **D. Severance of "Public Order (ordre public)"**
- **Constitutional Severability**: The Court **severed** "public order (ordre public)" from **Sections 14(1), 14(5), and 15(2)** of the Ordinance, leaving **"public order"** (law-and-order sense) intact.
- **Legislative Intent**: Assumed the legislature would have enacted the statute **without the unconstitutional part**, as the remaining provisions were **independently valid**.

#### **E. Criminal Sanctions (Section 17A)**
- **Unconstitutional Linkage**: **Section 17A** (criminalizing unauthorized assemblies) was **inextricably linked** to the unconstitutional discretion, rendering it **void**.
- **Severance Test**: The Privy Council’s test in **Attorney General for Alberta v. Attorney General for Canada** was applied—if the remaining provisions **cannot survive independently**, they are struck down.

#### **F. Notification Requirements**
- **Constitutional Validity**: **Sections 8 and 13A** (notification requirements) were upheld as **reasonable and necessary** for **policing and crowd safety**, provided they were **read down** to exclude **spontaneous demonstrations**.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

#### **A. Landmark Decision on Assembly Rights**
- This was the **first major ruling** by Hong Kong’s **Court of Final Appeal** on the **constitutionality of public assembly laws**, setting a **high bar for restrictions** on peaceful protest.
- The judgment **severely limited** the Commissioner’s power to ban processions, emphasizing that **"public order"** must be **narrowly defined** and **proportionate**.

#### **B. Unusual Statutory Interpretation**
- The Court **invented a novel remedy**—**severing** "public order (ordre public)" from the statute—rather than **reading it down** or **striking it down entirely**.
- The **separation of "public order" (law-and-order) from "ordre public" (moral/societal)** was a **creative legal solution**, though controversial.

#### **C. Criminal Sanctions Struck Down**
- The **entire Section 17A** (criminalizing unauthorized assemblies) was **struck down**, not just the discretionary powers. This was **unusual** because typically, only the **discretionary provisions** are invalidated, while **penalties remain**.
- The Court **refused to sever** Section 17A, arguing it was **too intertwined** with the unconstitutional powers.

#### **D. Emphasis on Legal Certainty**
- The judgment **reaffirmed** the **rule of law** by demanding **strict proportionality** and **certainty** in laws restricting fundamental rights—**unusual for an Asian jurisdiction** at the time.

#### **E. Political Context**
- The case arose from a **deliberate act of civil disobedience** (the appellants **chose to be prosecuted** to test the law), highlighting the **strategic use of litigation** in **human rights advocacy**.

#### **F. Dissenting Opinion**
- **Mr Justice Bokhary PJ** **dissented**, arguing that the **notification requirements** were **constitutional** and that the **appeal should be dismissed**. This **split decision** underscored the **complexity** of balancing rights and security.

---

### **Conclusion**
**Leung Kwok Hung v. HKSAR** is a **seminal case** that **redefined the limits of executive power** over peaceful assembly in Hong Kong. It **struck down** the **vaguely worded "public order (ordre public)"** concept, **severed** it from the statute, and **invalidated** the **criminal sanctions** linked to it. The judgment **strengthened** the **right to protest**, requiring **clear, proportionate, and certain** restrictions—setting a **high constitutional standard** for future assembly laws.
