### 1. Brief Summary of the Case

This case involves seven Hong Kong police officers who were convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and common assault against Tsang Kin Chiu during a protest operation on October 15, 2014, known as the Occupy Central movement. The officers were part of a police team (QRT A2-2) that was involved in clearing protesters from Lung Wo Road. During the operation, Tsang was allegedly assaulted by the officers while being restrained and transported to a police station. The trial led to convictions and sentences of 2 years’ imprisonment for each of the officers involved in the assault at the Substation, and an additional 1 month’s imprisonment for one officer involved in a separate assault inside an interview room.

The case was appealed on multiple grounds, including the admissibility of video evidence, the identification of the officers, and the fairness of the sentence. The Court of Appeal examined the admissibility of open-source video footage and photographs, the authenticity of the evidence, and the identification of the officers involved in the assault. The Court ultimately upheld the convictions of five of the officers but quashed the convictions of two others, D4 and D7, due to insufficient evidence of their involvement. The Court also reduced the sentences of the remaining officers.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties

**Prosecution's Argument:**
The prosecution argued that the video footage and photographs were admissible as evidence of the assault, as they were authenticated through circumstantial evidence, including the testimony of witnesses and the consistency of the footage with Tsang’s account. They contended that the judge correctly applied the legal standard for admissibility, which required a prima facie case of authenticity. The prosecution also emphasized the importance of the video evidence in establishing the sequence of events and the involvement of the officers in the assault.

**Defense's Argument:**
The defense challenged the admissibility of the video and photographs, arguing that the prosecution failed to establish the authenticity of the recordings and that the evidence was not reliable. They claimed that the footage was not properly authenticated and that the judge erred in relying on the testimony of TVB and ATV employees without producing the original recordings. The defense also contested the identification of the officers, arguing that the video footage was too grainy and that the judge’s identification of the officers was based on insufficient evidence. Additionally, the defense argued that the sentences were excessive and that the officers were not directly involved in the assault, as they were only present during the arrest and did not participate in the beating.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) of the Case

The case involved several important legal principles, particularly concerning the admissibility of video evidence, the standard of proof for authenticity, and the role of the trial judge in evaluating such evidence.

#### **Admissibility of Video Evidence and the Standard of Proof**
The Court held that the admissibility of video evidence is determined by whether it is relevant and whether it is prima facie authentic. The judge applied the test articulated in *HKSAR v Lee Chi Fai* and *R v Murphy*, which require that the evidence be relevant and that the authenticity be established by circumstantial evidence. The Court emphasized that the standard of proof for admissibility is not the balance of probabilities but rather a prima facie case of authenticity. This means that the prosecution must show that the evidence is likely to be authentic, not that it is beyond reasonable doubt.

The Court rejected the argument that the judge should have applied the balance of probabilities to determine the authenticity of the video recordings. It held that the judge was correct in applying the standard of prima facie authenticity, which is a lower threshold than the standard required for conviction. The Court also noted that the judge’s finding that the video footage was authentic beyond reasonable doubt was not required for admissibility, but rather for the jury to determine its weight and credibility.

#### **Authentication of Video Evidence**
The Court emphasized that the authenticity of video evidence can be established through circumstantial evidence, including the testimony of witnesses, the consistency of the footage with the witness’s account, and the absence of signs of tampering. The judge found that the video footage was authenticated through the testimony of TVB and ATV employees, who confirmed that the footage was unaltered and that it accurately depicted the events. The Court also noted that Tsang’s testimony, which was consistent with the footage, played a crucial role in establishing the authenticity of the recordings.

#### **Identification of the Officers**
The Court held that the identification of the officers was based on a combination of the video footage, the photographs, and the testimony of witnesses. The judge was satisfied that the officers were identifiable through their clothing, appearance, and behavior in the footage. The Court rejected the defense’s argument that the footage was too grainy or that the officers could not be identified with certainty. It emphasized that the judge’s identification of the officers was based on a careful and detailed examination of the evidence, and that the identification was supported by multiple sources.

#### **The Role of the Trial Judge in Evaluating Evidence**
The Court emphasized that the trial judge has a crucial role in evaluating the authenticity and relevance of video evidence. The judge is not required to determine the authenticity of the evidence beyond reasonable doubt for admissibility, but rather to determine whether there is a prima facie case of authenticity. The Court also noted that the judge’s role is to ensure that the evidence is relevant and that it has not been tampered with, and that the jury is responsible for determining the weight and credibility of the evidence.

#### **The Role of the Witness in Establishing Authenticity**
The Court held that the testimony of the witness, in this case Tsang, played a crucial role in establishing the authenticity of the video evidence. The Court emphasized that the witness’s testimony, which was consistent with the footage, provided a basis for the judge to find that the footage was authentic. The Court also noted that the judge was entitled to rely on the witness’s testimony to authenticate the evidence, even though the witness was not a professional expert in the field.

#### **The Role of the Court in Determining the Applicability of Legal Standards**
The Court emphasized that the legal standards for the admissibility of video evidence are not absolute and that the judge has discretion in determining whether the evidence is admissible. The Court also noted that the judge’s decision to admit the video evidence was based on a careful and detailed examination of the evidence, and that the judge was not required to apply a higher standard of proof than the prima facie case.

#### **The Role of the Court in Determining the Applicability of Legal Principles**
The Court emphasized that the legal principles applied in this case are not novel but are consistent with established legal standards. The Court also noted that the case involved a complex set of facts and that the judge’s decision was based on a thorough and detailed examination of the evidence.

### 4. Anything Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable About the Case

This case is remarkable for several reasons. First, it involved the use of open-source video footage and photographs as key evidence in a criminal trial, which is a relatively new and complex area of law. The case raised important questions about the admissibility of such evidence and the standard of proof required to authenticate it. The Court’s decision to admit the video evidence despite the defense’s objections highlights the growing importance of digital evidence in criminal trials.

Second, the case involved the conviction of police officers for assaulting a civilian, which is a serious breach of public trust and raises important questions about the conduct of law enforcement. The Court’s decision to reduce the sentences of the officers, while upholding the conviction of some and quashing the conviction of others, reflects the complexity of the case and the need for a careful and nuanced approach to the evidence.

Third, the case involved a detailed and extensive legal analysis of the admissibility of video evidence, which is a significant contribution to the law of evidence in Hong Kong. The Court’s decision to apply the standard of prima facie authenticity rather than the balance of probabilities is a notable departure from some other jurisdictions and highlights the importance of the role of the trial judge in evaluating the authenticity of evidence.

Finally, the case is notable for the extensive use of video evidence and the detailed analysis of the footage by the judge, which is a rare and significant example of the use of digital evidence in a criminal trial. The case also highlights the importance of the role of the witness in establishing the authenticity of the evidence and the need for a careful and thorough evaluation of the evidence by the trial judge.
