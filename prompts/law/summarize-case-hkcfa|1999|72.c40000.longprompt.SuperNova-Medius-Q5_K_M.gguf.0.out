### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case of NG KA LING AND ANOTHER v. THE DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION [1999] HKCFA 72 involves a constitutional challenge to the interpretation and application of the Basic Law of Hong Kong, specifically regarding the right of abode for permanent residents. The applicants, Miss Ng Ka Ling, Miss Ng Tan Tan, Mr Tsui Kuen Nang, and Miss Cheung Lai Wah, are Chinese nationals born on the Mainland who claim to be permanent residents of Hong Kong under Article 24(2) of the Basic Law. They argue that they have the right of abode in Hong Kong and should not be required to obtain a one-way permit from the Mainland authorities to establish their right of abode.

The Director of Immigration, on the other hand, contends that the applicants must obtain a one-way permit from the Mainland authorities and a certificate of entitlement from the Hong Kong authorities to establish their right of abode. This requirement is based on the Immigration (Amendment) (No 3) Ordinance 1997, which was enacted by the Provisional Legislative Council.

The applicants argue that the requirement for a one-way permit is unconstitutional and violates their right of abode under Article 24(3) of the Basic Law. They also challenge the constitutionality of the Provisional Legislative Council and the retrospective application of the No 3 Ordinance.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**Applicants' Arguments:**
- The applicants argue that they are permanent residents under Article 24(2) of the Basic Law and therefore have the right of abode under Article 24(3).
- They contend that the requirement for a one-way permit from the Mainland authorities to establish their right of abode is unconstitutional and violates their fundamental rights.
- They argue that the No 3 Ordinance, which introduced the requirement for a one-way permit, is unconstitutional, particularly its retrospective application.
- They also challenge the constitutionality of the Provisional Legislative Council, which enacted the No 3 Ordinance.

**Director's Arguments:**
- The Director argues that the applicants must obtain a one-way permit from the Mainland authorities and a certificate of entitlement from the Hong Kong authorities to establish their right of abode.
- He contends that Article 22(4) of the Basic Law, which requires approval for entry into Hong Kong from other parts of China, qualifies the right of abode in Article 24(3).
- He argues that the No 3 Ordinance is constitutional and that its retrospective application is valid.
- He also contends that the Provisional Legislative Council was a legally constituted body and that the No 3 Ordinance enacted by it is valid.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**Reference Issue:**
- The Court of Final Appeal held that it has the jurisdiction to interpret the relevant provisions of the Basic Law in adjudicating cases, without being bound to seek an interpretation from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress under Article 158 of the Basic Law.
- The Court established a test for determining whether a reference to the Standing Committee is required: the predominant provision that needs to be interpreted in the adjudication of the case must be an excluded provision (concerning affairs of the Central People's Government or the relationship between the Central Authorities and the Region).

**Constitutionality of the No 3 Ordinance:**
- The Court held that Article 22(4) of the Basic Law does not qualify the right of abode in Article 24(3) for permanent residents of Hong Kong.
- The requirement for a one-way permit from the Mainland authorities to establish the right of abode is unconstitutional as it infringes on the constitutional right of abode of permanent residents.
- However, the Court held that the scheme introduced by the No 3 Ordinance, apart from the requirement of the one-way permit, is constitutional as it is directed towards verification of a person's claim to be a permanent resident.

**Retrospectivity Issue:**
- The Court held that the retrospective provision in the No 3 Ordinance is unconstitutional as it would take away the constitutional right of abode that permanent residents were already enjoying under the Basic Law.
- The retrospective provision would also render the applicants guilty of criminal offences retrospectively, which is contrary to Article 15(1) of the ICCPR.

**Birth Out of Wedlock Issue:**
- The Court held that para 1(2)(b) of Schedule 1, which excludes a child born out of wedlock from the relationship of parent and child with the father, is unconstitutional.
- The Court interpreted Article 24(2) of the Basic Law to cover persons born in and out of wedlock, and therefore para 1(2)(b) is unconstitutional in excluding a child born out of wedlock.

**Provisional Legislative Council Issue:**
- The Court held that the Provisional Legislative Council was a legally constituted body and that the No 3 Ordinance enacted by it is valid.
- The PLC was established as an interim measure to fill the legislative vacuum before the formation of the First Legislative Council in accordance with the Basic Law and the 1990 Decision of the National People's Congress.

- **Right of Abode:** The case highlights the importance of the right of abode in Hong Kong and the constitutional protections afforded to permanent residents.
- **Interpretation of Constitutional Provisions:** The Court's interpretation of Article 24(2) and 24(3) of the Basic Law, as well as the relationship between Article 22(4) and Article 24, provides important guidance on the interpretation of constitutional provisions.
- **Retrospective Legislation:** The Court's ruling on the unconstitutionality of retrospective legislation is significant, as it sets a precedent for the protection of constitutional rights against retrospective laws.
- **Family Law and Equality:** The Court's decision on the birth out of wedlock issue is notable for its emphasis on equality and the protection of the rights of illegitimate children.
- **Legitimacy of the Provisional Legislative Council:** The Court's validation of the Provisional Legislative Council's legitimacy is significant, as it provides legal certainty for laws enacted by the PLC.

It sets important precedents for the protection of fundamental rights and the role of the courts in upholding the constitution. [end of text]
