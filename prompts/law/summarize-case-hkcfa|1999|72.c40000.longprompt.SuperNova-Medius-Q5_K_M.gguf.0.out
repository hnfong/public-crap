### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case of NG KA LING AND ANOTHER v. THE DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION [1999] HKCFA 72 involves four individuals, Miss Ng Ka Ling, Miss Ng Tan Tan, Mr Tsui Kuen Nang, and Miss Cheung Lai Wah, who are Chinese nationals born on the Mainland. They claim to be permanent residents of Hong Kong under Article 24(2) of the Basic Law, which defines permanent residents as those who are Chinese nationals born outside Hong Kong of residents listed in categories (1) and (2) of Article 24(2). The Director of Immigration, however, contends that they do not have the right of abode in Hong Kong under the Immigration (Amendment) (No 3) Ordinance 1997, which requires them to hold a one-way permit issued by the Mainland authorities and a certificate of entitlement issued by the Director of Immigration.

The applicants entered Hong Kong on or before July 1, 1997, and were detained by the Director of Immigration. They challenged the Director's decisions in judicial review proceedings, arguing that the No 3 Ordinance is unconstitutional and that they are entitled to the right of abode under Article 24(3) of the Basic Law.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments

**Applicants' Arguments:**

1. **Constitutionality of the No 3 Ordinance:** The applicants argue that the No 3 Ordinance is unconstitutional because it requires permanent residents to hold a one-way permit issued by the Mainland authorities before they can enjoy the right of abode. They contend that this requirement is not consistent with Article 24(3) of the Basic Law, which provides that permanent residents shall have the right of abode in Hong Kong.

2. **Right of Abode:** The applicants assert that they are permanent residents under Article 24(2) of the Basic Law and, therefore, have the right of abode in Hong Kong. They argue that the requirement of a one-way permit is an unconstitutional restriction on their right of abode.

3. **Retrospective Provision:** The applicants argue that the retrospective provision in the No 3 Ordinance, which deems it to have come into operation on July 1, 1997, is unconstitutional. They contend that this provision would render them guilty of criminal offenses for entering and remaining in Hong Kong without permission, which would be contrary to Article 15(1) of the ICCPR.

4. **Birth Out of Wedlock:** Miss Cheung Lai Wah argues that the provision in Schedule 1 of the Immigration Ordinance, which excludes children born out of wedlock from the relationship of parent and child, is unconstitutional. She contends that this provision discriminates against illegitimate children and is inconsistent with the principle of equality enshrined in the Basic Law and the ICCPR.

**Director's Arguments:**

1. **Constitutionality of the No 3 Ordinance:** The Director argues that the No 3 Ordinance is constitutional because it is consistent with Article 22(4) of the Basic Law, which provides that people from other parts of China must apply for approval to enter Hong Kong. He contends that the requirement of a one-way permit is necessary to ensure that the number of people entering Hong Kong for settlement is controlled.

2. **Right of Abode:** The Director argues that the applicants do not have the right of abode in Hong Kong because they do not hold a one-way permit issued by the Mainland authorities. He contends that the requirement of a one-way permit is a reasonable verification measure to ensure that individuals claiming to be permanent residents are indeed entitled to the right of abode.

3. **Retrospective Provision:** The Director argues that the retrospective provision in the No 3 Ordinance is constitutional because it is necessary to ensure that the Ordinance applies to all individuals who entered Hong Kong on or after July 1, 1997. He contends that the provision does not render the applicants guilty of criminal offenses because they were not aware of the requirement at the time of their entry.

4. **Birth Out of Wedlock:** The Director argues that the provision in Schedule 1 of the Immigration Ordinance, which excludes children born out of wedlock from the relationship of parent and child, is constitutional because it is consistent with the agreement reached in the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG). He contends that the agreement reached in the JLG is a subsequent agreement that should be taken into account in interpreting the Basic Law.

### 3. Summary of the Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**Reference Issue:**

The Court held that the Court of Final Appeal has the jurisdiction to interpret the relevant provisions of the Basic Law in adjudicating cases, including those concerning the relationship between the Central Authorities and the Region. The Court emphasized that the interpretation of the Basic Law is a matter of constitutional jurisdiction and that the Court of Final Appeal is not bound to seek an interpretation of such provisions from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress unless the provisions concern affairs which are the responsibility of the Central People's Government or the relationship between the Central Authorities and the Region.

**Constitutionality of the No 3 Ordinance:**

The Court held that the No 3 Ordinance is unconstitutional to the extent that it requires permanent residents residing on the Mainland to hold a one-way permit issued by the Mainland authorities before they can enjoy the constitutional right of abode. The Court emphasized that permanent residents are not "people from other parts of China" and that the requirement of a one-way permit is an unconstitutional restriction on their right of abode. However, the Court held that the scheme introduced by the No 3 Ordinance, apart from the requirement of a one-way permit, is constitutional as it is directed towards verification of a person's claim to be a permanent resident.

**Retrospective Provision:**

The Court held that the retrospective provision in the No 3 Ordinance, which deems it to have come into operation on July 1, 1997, is unconstitutional. The Court emphasized that the retrospective provision would take away the constitutional right of abode that the applicants were already enjoying under the Basic Law and would render them guilty of criminal offenses for entering and remaining in Hong Kong without permission.

**Birth Out of Wedlock:**

The Court held that the provision in Schedule 1 of the Immigration Ordinance, which excludes children born out of wedlock from the relationship of parent and child, is unconstitutional. The Court emphasized that the provision discriminates against illegitimate children and is inconsistent with the principle of equality enshrined in the Basic Law and the ICCPR. The Court held that the provision should be excised from the Ordinance and that the relationship of parent and child should be taken to exist between a father and a child born out of wedlock.

**Provisional Legislative Council:**

The Court held that the Provisional Legislative Council was a legally constituted body and that the No 3 Ordinance enacted by it was valid. The Court emphasized that the formation of the Provisional Legislative Council was consistent with the Basic Law and the Decision of the National People's Congress on the Method for the Formation of the First Government and the First Legislative Council of the Region. The Court held that the PLC was established as an interim measure to fill the legislative vacuum before the formation of the First Legislative Council in accordance with the Basic Law.

These legal principles are significant because they establish the constitutional jurisdiction of the Hong Kong courts to interpret the Basic Law and to declare laws unconstitutional, even those enacted by the National People's Congress. The Court's decision also emphasizes the importance of the principle of equality and the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms enshrined in the Basic Law and the ICCPR. The decision has far-reaching implications for the interpretation of the Basic Law and the protection of the rights of permanent residents in Hong Kong. [end of text]
