### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case, *Ng Ka Ling and Another v. The Director of Immigration* [1999] HKCFA 72, arose in the immediate aftermath of the handover of Hong Kong from British to Chinese sovereignty on 1 July 1997. It involved three individuals—Miss Ng Ka Ling, Miss Ng Tan Tan (sisters), Mr Tsui Kuen Nang, and Miss Cheung Lai Wah—who were Chinese nationals born on the Mainland of China but had fathers who were Hong Kong permanent residents under Article 24(2)(2) of the Basic Law (i.e., having resided in Hong Kong for at least seven years before or after 1997). Under Article 24(2)(3), such children are entitled to permanent resident status and the right of abode in Hong Kong.

All three applicants arrived in Hong Kong on or shortly after 1 July 1997, either without passing through immigration control points or with temporary permits. They immediately asserted their right of abode under Article 24(2)(3). The Director of Immigration refused to recognize their status, citing a new legal framework introduced by the Provisional Legislative Council of Hong Kong through the *Immigration (Amendment) (No 3) Ordinance 1997* (the No 3 Ordinance), which required applicants to obtain a "one way permit" issued by the Mainland Exit-Entry Administration and affixed with a "certificate of entitlement" issued by the Hong Kong Director of Immigration.

The applicants challenged this scheme in judicial review proceedings, arguing that it unlawfully restricted their constitutional right of abode under Article 24(3) of the Basic Law. The lower courts upheld the Director’s position, but the Court of Final Appeal (CFA) ultimately ruled in favor of the applicants, declaring key provisions of the No 3 Ordinance unconstitutional and invalid.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties

**Applicants’ Arguments:**
- The applicants argued that they were clearly within the third category of permanent residents under Article 24(2)(3) of the Basic Law: Chinese nationals born outside Hong Kong to a parent (father) who was a permanent resident under Article 24(2)(2).
- They contended that Article 24(3) grants permanent residents an unconditional right of abode, which includes the right to enter and remain in Hong Kong without restriction.
- They rejected the requirement to obtain a one way permit from the Mainland authorities as an unconstitutional interference with their fundamental right of abode.
- They argued that the No 3 Ordinance, by conditioning the exercise of a constitutional right on compliance with Mainland exit procedures, effectively subjected their right to the discretionary control of the Central Authorities, undermining Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy.
- They challenged the discriminatory treatment of children born out of wedlock (Miss Cheung), arguing that the law should treat such children equally regardless of parental marital status.
- They also challenged the retrospective application of the No 3 Ordinance, arguing it would retroactively criminalize their lawful presence in Hong Kong.

**Director of Immigration’s Arguments:**
- The Director maintained that the No 3 Ordinance was a valid legislative scheme introduced to implement the Basic Law and manage the influx of people from the Mainland.
- He argued that Article 22(4) of the Basic Law requires people from other parts of China to obtain approval for entry into Hong Kong, and that the number of settlers is determined by the Central Authorities after consultation with Hong Kong.
- He submitted that the applicants, being from the Mainland, were subject to this requirement and that the one way permit system was a necessary mechanism to ensure compliance with this constitutional provision.
- He claimed that the scheme was not a restriction on the right of abode but a verification mechanism to confirm identity and eligibility.
- He argued that the requirement to obtain a one way permit was consistent with the Joint Declaration and the "present practice" of regulating entry from the Mainland.
- He maintained that the birth out of wedlock provision in the Immigration Ordinance was a reasonable and necessary distinction based on established legal principles.
- He also argued that the retrospective application of the No 3 Ordinance was valid and necessary for administrative continuity.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) – Detailed and Thorough

The *Ng Ka Ling* case is one of the most significant constitutional decisions in Hong Kong’s post-handover history. It established foundational principles regarding the interpretation of the Basic Law, the limits of Hong Kong’s autonomy, and the supremacy of constitutional rights over administrative schemes. The ratio decidendi—the binding legal reasoning—can be broken down into several interrelated, novel, and controversial principles.

#### **A. The Court’s Jurisdiction to Interpret the Basic Law, Including Acts of the National People’s Congress**

One of the most groundbreaking and controversial aspects of the judgment is the Court’s assertion of its **independent constitutional jurisdiction to interpret and invalidate acts of the National People’s Congress (NPC) and its Standing Committee (SCNPC)**, even though these bodies are the supreme legislative authority in China.

The Court rejected the earlier view in *HKSAR v Ma Wai Kwan David* that Hong Kong courts could not question the validity of acts of the NPC or SCNPC. Instead, the CFA held that **the courts of Hong Kong have the duty and power to determine whether any act of the NPC or SCNPC is inconsistent with the Basic Law**, and if so, to declare it invalid. This is a radical departure from the traditional understanding of the relationship between Hong Kong and Beijing.

The Court grounded this jurisdiction in the **sovereign authority of the NPC to enact the Basic Law under Article 31 of the Chinese Constitution**, which makes the Basic Law a national law and the constitution of Hong Kong. As a constitution, it establishes a system of checks and balances. The courts, as the guardians of constitutional order, must ensure that all laws—including those enacted by the central authorities—are consistent with the Basic Law. The Court emphasized that **the Basic Law is not merely a delegation of power but a constitutional instrument that limits even the sovereign’s authority**.

This principle is novel because it establishes a **constitutional check on the central government** within the framework of "one country, two systems." It implies that the central government cannot unilaterally override Hong Kong’s constitutional rights, even through its own legislative acts. This has profound implications for the future of Hong Kong’s autonomy and the rule of law.

#### **B. The Interpretation of Article 158: When Must the Court Refer to the SCNPC?**

The Court also clarified the scope of **Article 158 of the Basic Law**, which governs the interpretation of the Basic Law by the SCNPC. The Court held that the Court of Final Appeal is **not obliged to refer a case to the SCNPC merely because an excluded provision (e.g., one concerning central government affairs) is relevant to the interpretation of a non-excluded provision**.

Instead, the Court established a **"substance test"**: the Court must ask, *What is the predominant provision being interpreted in the case?* If the core issue is a provision within Hong Kong’s autonomy (e.g., Article 24 on the right of abode), then **no reference is required**, even if an excluded provision (e.g., Article 22(4) on entry) is arguably relevant.

This test is crucial because it **protects the autonomy of Hong Kong’s judiciary**. If the Court were required to refer every time an excluded provision was mentioned, it would effectively cede interpretive power to the SCNPC on matters that are essentially internal to Hong Kong’s constitutional order. The Court emphasized that **Article 158 was designed to preserve the high degree of autonomy**, not to undermine it.

This interpretation is controversial because it **limits the SCNPC’s role in interpreting Hong Kong’s constitutional law**, even on matters that touch on central government responsibilities. It affirms that Hong Kong’s courts are the final arbiters of their own constitutional law, subject only to the constraints of the Basic Law itself.

#### **C. The Right of Abode is a Core Constitutional Right, Not Subject to Central Control**

The Court held that **Article 24(3) confers an unconditional right of abode on permanent residents**, which includes the right to enter and remain in Hong Kong without restriction. This right is **not qualified by Article 22(4)**, which governs entry for people from other parts of China.

The Court rejected the Director’s argument that Article 22(4) imposes a condition on the right of abode. It reasoned that **permanent residents of Hong Kong are not "people from other parts of China"**—they are residents of Hong Kong, a part of China, but with a distinct legal status. To treat them as such would be to **undermine the very concept of permanent residency** and reduce it to a privilege subject to Mainland approval.

The Court emphasized that **the right of abode is a core constitutional right**, essential to the enjoyment of other rights such as voting, freedom of movement, and protection from arbitrary removal. To subject it to the discretionary control of the Mainland authorities would be a **derogation from Hong Kong’s autonomy** and a violation of the "one country, two systems" principle.

This principle is **revolutionary** in its implications: it establishes that **Hong Kong’s constitutional rights are not merely "granted" by Beijing but are constitutionally entrenched and enforceable against any form of interference**, including from the central government.

#### **D. The No 3 Ordinance is Unconstitutional in Key Aspects, but the Verification Scheme is Valid**

The Court held that the **requirement to hold a one way permit affixed with a certificate of entitlement is unconstitutional** because it **conditions the exercise of a constitutional right on compliance with Mainland exit procedures**. This effectively makes the right of abode contingent on approval from the Central Authorities, which is impermissible.

However, the Court **did not strike down the entire No 3 Ordinance**. It distinguished between:
- **The unconstitutional part**: requiring a one way permit as a precondition to enjoying the right of abode.
- **The constitutional part**: a verification scheme to confirm a person’s claim to permanent resident status.

The Court upheld the **right to apply for a certificate of entitlement**, the **right to appeal to the Immigration Tribunal**, and the **requirement to remain in the Mainland during the application process**—as long as the process is fair and reasonable.

This **severance doctrine** is significant: it allows the Court to **excise unconstitutional provisions while preserving the rest of the law**, thereby avoiding a legislative vacuum. The Court emphasized that **the verification scheme must be operated lawfully and reasonably**, with safeguards such as the right to appeal and the duty to act without unreasonable delay.

#### **E. The Birth Out of Wedlock Provision is Unconstitutional**

The Court held that **para 1(2)(b) of Schedule 1**, which treats a father-child relationship only as existing if the child is legitimated by the parents’ marriage, is **unconstitutional** because it **discriminates against children born out of wedlock**.

The Court applied the **principle of equality** under Article 25 of the Basic Law and Articles 3 and 26 of the ICCPR. It noted that **the Basic Law and the ICCPR both enshrine the principle of non-discrimination**, and that Hong Kong domestic law increasingly treats illegitimate children equally with legitimate ones.

The Court concluded that **a child born out of wedlock is no less a "person born of" a permanent resident than one born in wedlock**. The language of Article 24(2)(3) is **neutral on marital status**, and to exclude such children would be **arbitrary and unjust**.

This decision is **progressive and human rights-oriented**, affirming that **family rights and equality are protected under Hong Kong’s constitutional order**, even in the face of traditional or administrative practices.

#### **F. The Retrospective Provision is Unconstitutional**

The Court held that **section 1(2) of the No 3 Ordinance**, which deemed the Ordinance to have come into operation on 1 July 1997, is **unconstitutional** because it **retroactively deprived permanent residents of their constitutional right of abode**.

The Court reasoned that **the applicants had already exercised their right of abode before 10 July 1997**, and that the No 3 Ordinance, as applied retrospectively, would have made their presence in Hong Kong a criminal offence under section 38 of the Immigration Ordinance (landing without permission).

This would violate **Article 15(1) of the ICCPR**, which prohibits retrospective criminal liability. The Court held that **the prohibition on retrospective criminal liability applies not only to prosecution but also to the creation of criminal offences by retrospective legislation**.

This is a **novel application of international human rights law** in Hong Kong’s constitutional context. It establishes that **even constitutional rights can be protected from retroactive erosion**, reinforcing the rule of law.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case

Several aspects of the case are striking and remarkable:

- **The Court’s assertion of jurisdiction over the NPC and SCNPC** is unprecedented. No other court in China has ever claimed the power to invalidate acts of the central legislature. This decision fundamentally redefines the relationship between Hong Kong and Beijing, positioning Hong Kong’s judiciary as a **constitutional check on the central government**.

- **The Court’s willingness to strike down a law enacted by the Provisional Legislative Council**—a body widely seen as politically appointed and lacking democratic legitimacy—shows a **remarkable commitment to the rule of law over political expediency**.

- **The case involved children born in the Mainland who were denied entry to Hong Kong despite being legally entitled to it**. The fact that infants were detained and held in custody for asserting their constitutional rights is deeply troubling and highlights the **human cost of constitutional overreach**.

- **The Court’s use of the ICCPR as a binding constitutional instrument**—even though it was adopted by the UK and Hong Kong was a British colony—demonstrates a **bold and principled commitment to international human rights standards**.

- **The decision was unanimous**, with all judges—including non-permanent judges from other common law jurisdictions—agreeing on the constitutional principles. This unity underscores the **high level of judicial independence and integrity** in Hong Kong’s judiciary.

- **The case was a test of the "one country, two systems" principle**. The Court’s decision affirmed that **the two systems are not merely administrative but constitutional**, and that Hong Kong’s legal and political autonomy is not a temporary concession but a permanent feature of the constitutional order.

In sum, *Ng Ka Ling* is not just a case about immigration—it is a **landmark constitutional decision** that redefined the boundaries of Hong Kong’s autonomy, affirmed the supremacy of the rule of law, and established a precedent that continues to resonate in Hong Kong’s legal and political life.
