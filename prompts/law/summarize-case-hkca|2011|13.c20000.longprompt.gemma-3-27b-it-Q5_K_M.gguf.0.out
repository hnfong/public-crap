## Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v. Chan Chun Chuen & Another [2011] HKCA 13: Case Summary

### 1. Facts of the Case

This case revolves around the probate of the will of Nina Wang, chairwoman of the Chinachem Group, a massive private conglomerate. Following her death in 2007, Chan Chun Chuen (the first defendant) produced a 2006 will naming him as the sole beneficiary, contradicting a 2002 will that bequeathed her entire estate to the Chinachem Charitable Foundation (the plaintiff), jointly established by her and her late husband, Teddy Wang.  Teddy Wang had been kidnapped and presumed dead for years, and Nina Wang had a long-running legal battle over his estate. Chan Chun Chuen claimed a long-term, intimate relationship with Nina Wang, alleging the 2002 will was a sham created during the earlier litigation. The plaintiff argued the 2006 will was a forgery. The lower court found in favor of the plaintiff, declaring the 2006 will a forgery. Chan Chun Chuen appealed this decision, challenging the judge’s factual findings and assessment of evidence.  A significant aspect of the case involved Chan Chun Chuen’s history as a *feng shui* master, and substantial financial transactions between him and Nina Wang, including large sums paid for *feng shui* services and investments in his companies.



### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**Plaintiff (Chinachem Charitable Foundation):**

*   The 2006 will was a forgery, and Chan Chun Chuen fabricated it to fraudulently claim Nina Wang’s vast estate.
*   Nina Wang’s consistent charitable intentions, demonstrated by the 2002 will and her philanthropic activities, were not abandoned.
*   Chan Chun Chuen’s evidence was unreliable and inconsistent, and he repeatedly lied to the court.
*   The evidence showed Nina Wang continued to prioritize the Foundation even after resuming contact with Chan Chun Chuen.
*   The circumstances surrounding the alleged signing of the 2006 will were suspicious and improbable.

**Defendant (Chan Chun Chuen):**

*   The 2006 will was genuine, reflecting Nina Wang’s true wishes to leave her estate to him due to their deep, loving relationship.
*   The 2002 will was a temporary measure created under duress during the legal battle over Teddy Wang’s estate, intended to garner public support.
*   The judge erred in disbelieving his testimony and failed to properly evaluate the evidence, particularly regarding the alleged intimacy of their relationship.
*   The judge failed to adequately consider inherent improbabilities in the plaintiff’s case and relied too heavily on the testimony of witnesses he deemed untrustworthy.
*   The expert handwriting evidence was misinterpreted by the judge.



### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

This case establishes and reinforces several important legal principles relating to probate, forgery, evidence, and the assessment of credibility in court.  The core of the decision rests on a rigorous application of established principles of evidence and a strong affirmation of the court’s duty to detect and prevent fraudulent attempts to manipulate testamentary documents.

**1. Forgery and the Burden of Proof:** The case reaffirms that the burden of proving the validity of a will rests with the proponent (Chan Chun Chuen in this case).  Once a challenge to the will’s authenticity is raised, the proponent must demonstrate its genuineness.  The court held that the evidence overwhelmingly established the 2006 will was a forgery, and the defendant failed to rebut this presumption.  This principle is fundamental to probate law, ensuring that testamentary wishes are carried out only when legitimately expressed.

**2. Assessment of Witness Credibility:** The Court of Appeal strongly endorsed the trial judge’s assessment of Chan Chun Chuen’s credibility, finding him to be a demonstrably untrustworthy witness.  The judgment emphasizes that a trial judge is in the best position to assess witness credibility based on demeanor, consistency of testimony, and overall impression.  The appellate court will only interfere with such assessments in exceptional circumstances, and none were present here.  This reinforces the principle that factual findings made by a trial judge, particularly regarding credibility, are given significant deference on appeal.

**3.  Evaluation of Evidence – Inherent Improbabilities & Accumulation of Circumstantial Evidence:** The court clarified the proper approach to evaluating evidence, specifically the importance of considering inherent improbabilities.  The judge *did* consider the inherent improbabilities presented by the defendant, despite arguments to the contrary. The court emphasized that identifying improbabilities is only the first step; the judge must then weigh those improbabilities against the totality of the evidence.  The court found the accumulation of circumstantial evidence – the suspicious circumstances surrounding the will’s creation, the defendant’s dishonest conduct, the financial transactions, and the testimony of the attesting witnesses – overwhelmingly supported the conclusion of forgery. This highlights the principle that a case can be established through a convergence of circumstantial evidence, even without direct proof.

**4.  Expert Evidence in Handwriting Analysis:** The case provides a detailed discussion of the principles governing expert evidence in handwriting analysis. It affirms the importance of considering the range of variation in a person’s handwriting and the significance of identifying rare or unusual features. The court upheld the judge’s acceptance of the plaintiff’s expert’s opinion that the Nina Wang signature was a highly skilled simulation, based on a careful analysis of numerous features and a rejection of the defendant’s expert’s methodology.  The court also clarified the importance of considering the context of the handwriting, such as the condition of the paper and the writing instrument used.  The judgment also touches on the statistical approach to handwriting analysis, affirming the validity of considering the improbability of a combination of rare features appearing in a forged document.

**5.  The Significance of Attesting Witnesses:** The testimony of the attesting witnesses (Mr. Wong and Mr. Ng) was pivotal to the court’s decision. Their evidence established that the document they witnessed on October 16, 2006, was *not* the 2006 will presented by Chan Chun Chuen. This finding was considered conclusive evidence of forgery. The case underscores the critical role of attesting witnesses in probate proceedings and the importance of scrutinizing their testimony.

**6. Costs and Abuse of Process:** The court awarded costs on an indemnity basis to the plaintiff, reflecting the egregious nature of the defendant’s conduct. The court explicitly stated that Chan Chun Chuen had abused the process of the court by presenting a forged will and engaging in dishonest behavior. This reinforces the principle that courts have the power to penalize parties who engage in fraudulent or abusive litigation tactics.



**Novel or Controversial Points:**

*   **The "No-Lose" Argument in Handwriting Analysis:** The discussion of the "no-lose" argument – the idea that a large range of variation in handwriting makes it difficult to definitively identify a forgery – is a nuanced point in forensic science. The court’s acceptance of this argument, combined with the statistical analysis, highlights the importance of considering the probability of certain features occurring in a genuine signature.
*   **The Weight Given to Circumstantial Evidence:** The case demonstrates the power of circumstantial evidence in establishing a case of fraud. While no single piece of evidence was conclusive, the accumulation of suspicious circumstances created a compelling narrative of forgery. This reinforces the principle that circumstantial evidence can be sufficient to meet the burden of proof, particularly in cases where direct evidence is unavailable.
*   **The Court’s Strong Discretion in Assessing Credibility:** The court’s unwavering support for the trial judge’s assessment of Chan Chun Chuen’s credibility underscores the significant deference given to trial judges in evaluating witness testimony. This principle, while well-established, is sometimes criticized for potentially allowing subjective biases to influence the outcome of a case.



In conclusion, *Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v. Chan Chun Chuen* is a significant case that reaffirms fundamental principles of probate law, evidence, and judicial discretion. It serves as a strong deterrent against fraudulent attempts to manipulate testamentary documents and underscores the court’s commitment to upholding the integrity of the probate process.
