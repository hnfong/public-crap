Okay, here's a breakdown of the sections you requested, starting with Sec. 30001, adhering to your specified format.

**Sec. 30001. Funding Cap for the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection.**

This section amends the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010. It reduces the funding cap for the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB) from $12 billion to $6.5 billion annually. This change limits the maximum amount of funding the CFPB can receive, potentially impacting its ability to regulate financial institutions and protect consumers.

**Sec. 30002. Rescission of Funds for Green and Resilient Retrofit Program for Multifamily Housing.**

This section rescinds any unobligated funds remaining from the Green and Resilient Retrofit Program for Multifamily Housing, which was established in 2022. The rescission applies to funds allocated under section 30002(a) of the prior reconciliation act (Public Law 117-169). This effectively eliminates any remaining funding available for this program, which aimed to support energy-efficient upgrades in multifamily housing.

**Sec. 30003. Securities and Exchange Commission Reserve Fund.**

This section significantly alters the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Reserve Fund. It eliminates the existing fund structure (subsection (i) of section 4 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), renumbers subsequent subsections, and redirects the fund's purpose to solely paying whistleblower awards.  Furthermore, it allows the SEC to expend previously obligated funds until October 1, 2025, and then mandates the transfer of any remaining obligated and unobligated balances to the general fund of the Treasury, effectively closing the fund.

**Sec. 30004. Appropriations for Defense Production Act.**

This section provides an additional $1,000,000,000 in funding for the Defense Production Act (DPA). These funds, sourced from amounts not otherwise appropriated, can be used to carry out the DPA's objectives and will remain available until September 30, 2027. The DPA allows the government to incentivize domestic manufacturing and address supply chain vulnerabilities, particularly in critical industries.
