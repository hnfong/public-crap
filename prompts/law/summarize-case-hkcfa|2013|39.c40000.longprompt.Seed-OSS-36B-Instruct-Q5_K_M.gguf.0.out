Got it, let's tackle this case summary step by step. First, I need to remember the four tasks: facts, parties' arguments, legal principles (ratio), and striking aspects. 

Starting with the facts. The appellant is W, a post-operative male-to-female transsexual who underwent sex reassignment surgery (SRS) and now lives as a woman. She wants to marry her male partner but was refused by the Registrar of Marriages, who cited the Marriage Ordinance (MO) and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance (MCO) as defining marriage as between a man and a woman, with "woman" meaning biological female. The case went through HC and CA, both dismissing her claim, so she appealed to HKCFA.

Next, parties' arguments. Appellant (W) argues she's a woman for marriage purposes under HK law, relying on constitutional rights (Basic Law Art 37, HKBOR Art 19(2)) to marry, and that statutory construction should include post-op transsexuals. Registrar argues statutory construction limits "woman" to biological females (per Corbett v Corbett), and no constitutional violation because the right to marry doesn't require recognizing transsexuals, especially without societal consensus.

Legal principles: This is the key part. First, statutory construction: The majority (Ma CJ, Ribeiro PJ, Bokhary NPJ) initially agreed with Registrar that MO s40 and MCO s20(1)(d) originally adopted the UK Corbett test (biological criteria: chromosomes, gonads, genitalia fixed at birth). But then they held this is unconstitutional because it impairs the essence of the right to marry under Basic Law Art 37 and HKBOR Art 19(2). The minority (Chan PJ) dissented, sticking to statutory construction and traditional marriage concepts.

Novel points: The majority shifted from strict statutory construction to remedial interpretation due to constitutional rights. They cited the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) in Goodwin v UK, which held that excluding post-op transsexuals from marriage violates Art 12 ECHR because it impairs the essence of the right. The HK court applied this to local law: even though statutes originally used biological criteria, the right to marry (a fundamental right) can't be impaired by outdated criteria. They emphasized that medical advances (SRS, hormonal treatment) and social changes mean psychological/social factors (self-perception, living as the acquired gender) must be considered, not just biology fixed at birth.

Also, the court discussed remedial interpretation: instead of striking down the statutes, they read "woman" to include post-op transsexuals who have undergone SRS (with medical certification) to align with constitutional rights. They suspended the declaration for 12 months to allow legislation, but held the right exists constitutionally.

Striking aspects: The split judgment is notable—majority prioritizes constitutional rights over strict statutory construction, while minority defends traditional marriage and legislative intent. Also, the court's emphasis on evolving societal attitudes and medical understanding of gender identity, which was novel in HK at the time. The case marked a shift in HK law towards recognizing transsexual rights in marriage, aligning with international trends (like Goodwin) but through a constitutional rather than legislative route initially.

Need to make sure each part is covered: facts are clear, parties' arguments are balanced, legal principles distinguish statutory construction vs constitutional override, and striking points highlight the judgment's significance in HK's legal landscape for trans rights.</seed:think>### 1. Brief Summary of Facts  
The appellant, **W**, is a post-operative male-to-female transsexual who underwent sex reassignment surgery (SRS) and lives full-time as a woman. She sought to marry her male partner but was refused by the **Registrar of Marriages**, who invoked the *Marriage Ordinance (Cap 181)* (MO) and *Matrimonial Causes Ordinance (Cap 179)* (MCO). These statutes define marriage as the union of "one man and one woman," and the Registrar argued W, despite SRS, remained a biological male for legal purposes. W challenged this via judicial review, losing at first instance (High Court) and Court of Appeal (CA). She appealed to the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal (HKCFA), which granted leave to hear questions on statutory construction and constitutional compatibility with the Basic Law and Hong Kong Bill of Rights (HKBOR).


### 2. Arguments of the Two Parties  
#### **Appellant (W)**  
- **Statutory Construction**: Argues "woman" in MO §40 and MCO §20(1)(d) should include post-operative transsexuals, as societal and medical understanding of gender has evolved.  
- **Constitutional Rights**: Claims the right to marry (Basic Law Art 37; HKBOR Art 19(2)) is violated by excluding her. The statutes’ biological criteria (fixed at birth) are outdated and impair the "essence" of the right to marry, as she can only marry a man (her desired partner) if recognized as a woman.  
- **Medical/Social Context**: Emphasizes that W underwent full SRS (removal of male genitalia, construction of artificial vagina), hormonal treatment, and lives as a woman—factors the law must acknowledge.  

#### **Registrar of Marriages (Respondent)**  
- **Statutory Construction**: Insists "woman" retains its ordinary, biological meaning (fixed at birth via chromosomes, gonads, genitalia) per the UK’s *Corbett v Corbett* (1971), which HK legislation explicitly adopted.  
- **Constitutional Compliance**: Denies a violation, arguing the right to marry does not require recognizing transsexuals. The Registrar cites the lack of "societal consensus" in Hong Kong and claims the law merely reflects the traditional institution of marriage (rooted in procreation and opposite-sex unions).  
- **Practical Concerns**: Warns of far-reaching legal repercussions (e.g., existing marriages, parentage) if transsexuals are recognized, urging the issue be left to the legislature.  


### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The case is landmark for its reconciliation of statutory intent, constitutional rights, and evolving societal norms. Key principles include:  

#### **A. Statutory Construction: Initial Deference to Legislative History**  
The majority (Ma CJ, Ribeiro PJ, Bokhary NPJ) first confirmed that HK’s MO and MCO originally adopted the UK’s *Corbett v Corbett* test, which limited "man/woman" to **biological criteria fixed at birth** (chromosomes, gonads, genitalia). This reflected the 1970s legislative intent to codify the common law view that marriage requires opposite-sex parties, excluding post-operative transsexuals.  

#### **B. Constitutional Override: The Right to Marry as a Fundamental Right**  
However, the majority held the statutory construction **unconstitutional** under the Basic Law (Art 37) and HKBOR (Art 19(2)). Critical reasoning included:  
- **Essence of the Right to Marry**: The ECtHR’s *Goodwin v UK* (2002) established that denying post-operative transsexuals the right to marry in their acquired gender "impairs the very essence" of the right to marry (Art 12 ECHR). The HKCFA applied this to HK: W, who lives as a woman and can only marry a man (her partner), is effectively denied the right to marry altogether—violating her constitutional rights.  
- **Living Instruments**: The Basic Law and HKBOR are "living instruments" that must adapt to societal change. Medical advances (e.g., SRS, hormonal therapy) and greater acceptance of gender identity disorders mean biological criteria alone are insufficient; **psychological and social factors** (self-perception, lived experience as the acquired gender) must be considered.  
- **Remedial Interpretation**: Instead of striking down the statutes, the court used "remedial interpretation" (per *Lam Kwong Wai v HKSAR*) to read "woman" in MO §40 and MCO §20(1)(d) as including post-operative transsexuals with medical certification of gender reassignment. This aligns the statutes with constitutional rights while preserving their validity.  

#### **C. Dissent: Traditional Marriage and Legislative Deference**  
Chan PJ dissented, arguing:  
- Statutory construction must prioritize the ordinary meaning of "man/woman" (biological) as intended by the legislature in 1972.  
- The right to marry does not require recognizing transsexuals, as marriage’s "essence" remains rooted in procreation and opposite-sex unions.  
- Social change should be addressed by the legislature, not the courts, to avoid "judicial policymaking."  

#### **D. Novelty: Balancing Tradition and Rights**  
The majority’s focus on **evolving gender identity** and **remedial interpretation** was novel in HK. It rejected the rigid "biology-only" test of *Corbett* in favor of a holistic approach that values both legal stability and individual dignity—marking a shift toward recognizing transsexual rights in marriage.  


### 4. Striking/Unusual Aspects  
- **Split Judgment**: The HKCFA’s 3–1 split (with Bokhary NPJ concurring in part) highlighted deep divisions over whether courts should lead on trans rights or defer to the legislature.  
- **Constitutional Activism**: The majority’s use of remedial interpretation to override statutory intent was bold, as HK courts typically avoid "judicial lawmaking" on social issues. It signaled that fundamental rights (like marriage) take precedence over outdated legislative frameworks.  
- **International Alignment**: The case mirrored the ECtHR’s *Goodwin* decision but applied HK’s unique constitutional framework, demonstrating how regional human rights law influences local jurisprudence.  
- **Practical Suspension**: The court suspended its declaration for 12 months to allow the legislature to enact comprehensive gender recognition laws—a pragmatic compromise between judicial activism and democratic decision-making.  

Most notably, the case marked HK’s first major step toward legal recognition of transsexual marriages, reflecting broader global trends toward inclusivity while grappling with the tension between tradition and modern rights. [end of text]
