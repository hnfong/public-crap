Got it, let's tackle this. The user wants summaries for every Sec. XXXX starting with 50101, each 1-4 sentences, specific with parties, entities, quantities. First, I need to go through each section provided and extract the key points concisely.

Starting with Sec. 50101: Onshore oil and gas leasing. It repeals parts of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) related to onshore royalties and noncompetitive leasing, restores prior law. Requires the Secretary of the Interior to resume quarterly onshore lease sales in specified Western States (Wyoming, NM, CO, UT, MT, ND, OK, NV, AK) with minimum 4 per year, 50% of nominated parcels offered. Amends the Mineral Leasing Act to speed up leasing (18 months from expression of interest) and sets 4-year non-renewable drill permits, allowing commingling with certain conditions.

Sec. 50102: Offshore oil and gas leasing. Mandates 30 Gulf of Mexico region-wide lease sales by 2040 (1 by 2025, 2/year 2026-2039, 1 in 2040) and 6 Cook Inlet (AK) sales by 2032 (1/year 2026-2028, 2030-2032). Sets Gulf royalty rates 12.5-16.6% (up from 12.5%), 10-year primary term for deepwater (≥800m). For AK Cook Inlet, 70% of revenues go to AK starting 2034, 30% to Treasury. Repeals IRA offshore royalty increases, allows commingling unless unsafe or reduces recovery.

Sec. 50103: Royalties on extracted methane. Repeals IRA’s Section 50263 (which likely imposed methane royalties).

Sec. 50104: Alaska oil and gas leasing (Coastal Plain).
