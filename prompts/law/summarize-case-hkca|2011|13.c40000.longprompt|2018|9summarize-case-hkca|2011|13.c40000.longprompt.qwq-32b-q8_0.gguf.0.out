Okay, let's tackle this case summary. First, I need to go through the provided judgment and extract the key points for each of the four tasks. Let me start with the first task: summarizing the facts.

The case is HKSAR v. So Ping Chi [2018]. The defendant was a senior official in the Marine Department responsible for enforcing safety regulations on local vessels. The specific charge was misconduct in public office for instructing subordinates not to enforce certain lifejacket requirements under the Merchant Shipping (Local Vessels) Safety Regulation (Cap 548G). The regulation required 100% adult lifejackets plus 5% children's lifejackets, but the defendant's instruction exempted older vessels licensed before 2007. This policy continued until a ferry collision in 2012 led to an inquiry, revealing the non-enforcement. The defendant was convicted and sentenced to 16 months, but the appeal focused on conviction and sentence.

Next, the arguments of both parties. The prosecution argued that the defendant's instruction was a deliberate defiance of the law, leading to serious safety risks. They emphasized that the misconduct was serious enough for criminal liability, not just disciplinary action. The defense contended there was insufficient evidence of intent and that the defendant had a reasonable excuse (smooth implementation of the law). They also argued that the consequences weren't severe since the old and new laws were similar in safety terms.

For the legal principles, the key points are the elements of misconduct in public office: wilfulness, seriousness, and lack of reasonable excuse. The court distinguished between nonfeasance (failure to act) and misfeasance (acting improperly). Here, it was nonfeasance, so only intent and seriousness were needed, not a corrupt motive. The court upheld the conviction, finding the defendant's actions were deliberate and serious because they undermined public safety and trust. The sentence was reduced because the defendant's predecessors and successors weren't prosecuted, raising fairness concerns.

Lastly, the striking aspect is the disparity in treatment: the defendant faced criminal charges while his predecessors and successors only faced disciplinary actions. This inconsistency in prosecution is unusual and raises questions about fairness and selective enforcement of the law.

Wait, did I miss anything? Let me check the judgment again. The defendant's instruction was a continuation of a prior policy, but he didn't rescind it. The court considered that even inherited policies require proper authority and consultation. The sentence reduction was due to the unfairness of only prosecuting him. Also, the legal principles part should mention the reliance on Shum Kwok Sher and the distinction between nonfeasance and misfeasance. The ratio decidendi is that nonfeasance doesn't require a corrupt motive, just wilful intent and serious consequences. The court also emphasized that public officials can't substitute their judgment for legislative intent, especially regarding safety regulations.

I think that covers all the points. Now, structure each section concisely but thoroughly.

### 1. Summary of the Facts  
The defendant, So Ping Chi, was the General Manager and Principal Surveyor of Ships in the Marine Department’s Local Vessel Safety Branch (LVSB) from April 2007 to August 2010. His role included enforcing safety regulations under the *Merchant Shipping (Local Vessels) (Safety and Survey) Regulation* (Cap 548G), which required vessels to provide 100% adult lifejackets and 5% children’s lifejackets.  

Before Cap 548G’s 2007 enactment, vessels only needed lifejackets for 40% of passengers, with other life-saving equipment covering the rest. The new law imposed stricter requirements but included a 12-month grace period. The defendant’s predecessor had implemented a policy exempting vessels licensed before 2007 (“old vessels”) from the new children’s lifejacket rule, under the rationale of easing industry financial burdens.  

Upon taking office, the defendant continued this policy, instructing subordinates not to enforce the children’s lifejacket requirement for old vessels. This instruction remained in place until 2013, after a fatal ferry collision near Lamma Island exposed the policy during a Commission of Inquiry. The defendant was charged with misconduct in public office for wilfully instructing non-enforcement and failing to rescind the policy. He was convicted and sentenced to 16 months’ imprisonment.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties  
**Prosecution:**  
- The defendant’s instruction was a deliberate defiance of the law, substituting his judgment for legislative intent.  
- The misconduct was serious because it endangered public safety by exempting hundreds of vessels from critical safety requirements.  
- Non-enforcement of life-saving regulations undermined public trust in the Marine Department and the civil service.  
- The defendant’s actions were wilful, as he issued the instruction knowingly and failed to rescind it for years.  

**Defense:**  
- Insufficient evidence proved the defendant issued the instruction or failed to rescind it deliberately.  
- The defendant had a reasonable excuse: ensuring “smooth implementation” of the law by accommodating industry concerns.  
- The old and new laws were practically similar in safety outcomes (e.g., adult lifejackets could fit children), so the consequences were not severe.  
- The misconduct warranted disciplinary action, not criminal prosecution, as no dishonesty, corruption, or malice was shown.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  

#### **Elements of Misconduct in Public Office**  
The offense requires:  
1. **Wilfulness**: The misconduct must be deliberate, not accidental.  
2. **Seriousness**: The breach must be grave enough to warrant criminal sanction, considering the office’s responsibilities and public interest.  
3. **Lack of Reasonable Excuse**: The defendant must have no justification for their actions.  

#### **Nonfeasance vs. Misfeasance**  
The court distinguished between:  
- **Nonfeasance** (failure to act): Requires only *wilful intent* and *serious consequences* to establish culpability. No corrupt motive is needed.  
- **Misfeasance** (improper exercise of power): May require proof of dishonesty, corruption, or malice.  

Here, the defendant’s failure to enforce the law was **nonfeasance**, as he wilfully neglected his duty. The court rejected the defense’s reliance on *Shum Kwok Sher v HKSAR* (2002), which held that nonfeasance does not require a corrupt motive.  

#### **Seriousness of Conduct**  
The court emphasized that the defendant’s actions:  
- **Undermined legislative intent**: By exempting vessels from a law designed to improve safety, he substituted his judgment for that of the legislature.  
- **Endangered public safety**: Children’s lifejackets were critical in emergencies, and the policy left hundreds of vessels non-compliant.  
- **Abused public trust**: The defendant’s senior role required strict adherence to safety regulations, which he breached for an extended period.  

#### **Reasonable Excuse**  
The court rejected the “smooth implementation” defense:  
- The defendant had no legal authority to exempt vessels; only the Director of Marine could do so.  
- He failed to consult superiors or seek legal advice before issuing the instruction.  
- The policy’s longevity (until 2013) and lack of transparency meant the public had no assurance of compliance.  

#### **Sentence Considerations**  
- The defendant’s lack of prior criminal record and exemplary character were mitigating factors.  
- However, the misconduct’s seriousness, duration (3+ years), and erosion of public trust justified a custodial sentence.  
- The court reduced the sentence from 16 to time served (4.5 months), citing unfairness: the defendant’s predecessors and successors faced only disciplinary action despite equal involvement.

### 4. Striking or Unusual Aspects of the Case  
- **Disparity in Prosecution**: The defendant alone faced criminal charges, while his predecessors and successors (who continued the policy) received only warnings. This inconsistency raised fairness concerns, prompting the court to reduce his sentence.  
- **Policy Continuation**: The defendant inherited the non-enforcement policy but chose to maintain it without legal authority. This highlights the risks of informal policies in public agencies.  
- **Safety vs. Industry Concerns**: The case underscores the tension between enforcing life-saving regulations and accommodating industry financial pressures. The court made clear that public safety must prevail.  
- **Judicial Caution on Sentencing**: The reduction of the sentence to time served, despite the gravity of the offense, reflects the court’s reluctance to impose disproportionate punishment in the face of systemic unfairness.  

This case serves as a landmark in Hong Kong for clarifying the boundaries of public office misconduct, emphasizing that even well-intentioned policy decisions cannot override statutory duties. [end of text]
