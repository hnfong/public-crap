### 1. Summary of Facts

In this consolidated case, *Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump* and *Trump v. V.O.S. Selections, Inc.*, the Supreme Court addressed the scope of the President's authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Shortly after taking office in 2025, President Trump declared national emergencies regarding two "unusual and extraordinary" threats: the influx of illegal drugs from Canada, Mexico, and China, and "large and persistent" trade deficits that he claimed had hollowed out American manufacturing.

Invoking IEEPA, the President imposed two sets of tariffs. First, he levied a 25% duty on most imports from Canada and Mexico and a 10% duty on most Chinese imports to address the drug crisis. Second, he imposed a "reciprocal" tariff of at least 10% on imports from all trading partners to address trade deficits, with rates rising significantly for certain nations (e.g., reaching 145% on Chinese goods). The President modified these rates frequently and unilaterally.

Petitioners, consisting of small businesses and several states, sued, arguing that IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs. The District Court granted a preliminary injunction, and the Court of International Trade (CIT) granted summary judgment for the plaintiffs. The Federal Circuit, sitting *en banc*, affirmed, holding that IEEPA's grant to "regulate... importation" did not authorize unbounded tariffs. The Supreme Court granted certiorari and consolidated the cases to decide whether IEEPA authorizes the President to impose tariffs.

### 2. Summary of Arguments

**The Government (President Trump):**
The Government argued that IEEPA's authorization to "regulate... importation" is broad enough to include the power to impose tariffs. They contended that tariffs are a traditional and common tool for regulating imports, alongside quotas and embargoes. They pointed to historical precedents, including President Nixon's 1971 tariffs imposed under the predecessor statute (TWEA) and the Supreme Court's 1976 decision in *Federal Energy Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc.*, which upheld similar monetary exactions under the phrase "adjust the imports." The Government argued that Congress, when enacting IEEPA in 1977, was aware of this interpretation and intended to retain the power to use tariffs as a flexible emergency tool. They further argued that the "major questions doctrine" should not apply to foreign affairs statutes, where Congress has historically granted the President broad discretion.

**The Petitioners (Learning Resources and V.O.S. Selections):**
The Petitioners argued that the power to impose tariffs is a core legislative power vested exclusively in Congress under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. They contended that the word "regulate" in IEEPA does not encompass the power to tax or levy duties, as Congress has historically used specific terms like "duty," "tariff," or "surcharge" when delegating such power. They emphasized that IEEPA contains no explicit reference to tariffs and that no President had ever used IEEPA to impose tariffs prior to this administration. They argued that interpreting "regulate" to include tariffs would grant the President unbounded power to tax without the procedural safeguards and limits found in other tariff statutes, violating separation of powers principles.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) of the Majority Decision

The majority opinion, delivered by Chief Justice Roberts and joined by Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, Gorsuch, Barrett, and Jackson (in part), held that IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs. The decision rests on two primary pillars: the "major questions doctrine" and ordinary statutory interpretation.

**The Major Questions Doctrine and Separation of Powers**
The Court applied the "major questions doctrine," a principle requiring clear congressional authorization for executive actions of vast economic and political significance. The Court reasoned that the power to impose tariffs is a "core congressional power of the purse," explicitly granted to Congress in Article I, Section 8. The Framers intended for Congress alone to have access to the people's pockets, a power the Executive does not possess inherently in peacetime.

The Court found that the President's claim to impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration, and scope under IEEPA represented a "transformative expansion" of executive authority. The stakes in this case were described as "dwarfing" those of previous major questions cases, with projections of trillions of dollars in economic impact. Under the major questions doctrine, the Court held that Congress would not have delegated such a "big-time policy call" through ambiguous language. The Court rejected the Government's arguments that the doctrine should not apply to emergency statutes or foreign affairs matters. The Court emphasized that while the President has broad discretion in foreign affairs, the specific power to tax (including tariffs) remains with Congress, and the Constitution does not allow Congress to relinquish this power through vague statutory text.

**Statutory Interpretation of "Regulate"**
Even without the major questions doctrine, the Court concluded that the text of IEEPA does not support the President's position. The statute authorizes the President to "investigate, block... regulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit... importation." The Court noted that the word "regulate" is absent from the list of powers that include taxation. The Court observed that in the U.S. Code, the power to "regulate" is distinct from the power to "tax." When Congress intends to delegate taxing power, it uses specific vocabulary such as "duty," "tariff," or "surcharge," none of which appear in IEEPA.

The Court further reasoned that reading "regulate" to include taxation would render IEEPA partly unconstitutional, as the Constitution forbids taxes on exports, yet IEEPA authorizes the regulation of both importation and exportation. Additionally, the Court looked to the "neighboring words" in the statute (investigate, block, compel, etc.), which describe actions to control or sanction foreign actors, not to raise revenue for the Treasury. The Court also dismissed the Government's reliance on historical precedents, noting that the Nixon tariffs were limited in scope and duration, and the *Algonquin* decision involved a different statute with different context. The Court concluded that the lack of historical precedent for using IEEPA to impose tariffs, combined with the breadth of the authority claimed, indicated that Congress did not intend to grant such power.

**Novelty and Controversy**
A significant aspect of this decision is the explicit extension of the major questions doctrine into the realm of foreign affairs and national security. Historically, courts have been more deferential to the Executive in foreign policy matters. By applying the doctrine here, the Court signaled that even in the context of foreign threats and emergencies, the specific constitutional power to tax cannot be delegated without clear, explicit statutory language. The Court also firmly rejected the notion that "regulate" is a catch-all term that implicitly includes taxation, reinforcing a strict separation between regulatory and taxing powers.

### 4. Legal Principles and Arguments of the Dissenting Side

**Justice Kavanaugh (joined by Justices Thomas and Alito):**
Justice Kavanaugh dissented, arguing that IEEPA clearly authorizes the President to impose tariffs. His dissent focused on statutory text, history, and precedent.

*   **Text and History:** He argued that the ordinary meaning of "regulate... importation" has historically included tariffs. He pointed to dictionary definitions and the fact that tariffs are a traditional tool for regulating imports, just as quotas and embargoes are.
*   **Precedent:** He heavily relied on *Federal Energy Administration v. Algonquin SNG, Inc.* (1976), where the Supreme Court unanimously held that the phrase "adjust the imports" authorized the President to impose monetary exactions (tariffs) without the word "tariff" appearing in the statute. He also cited President Nixon's 1971 tariffs, which were upheld by the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals under the predecessor statute (TWEA) using the same "regulate... importation" language.
*   **Foreign Affairs Exception:** Justice Kavanaugh argued that the major questions doctrine should not apply to foreign affairs statutes. He cited *United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.* and *Youngstown*, noting that Congress has historically granted the President broad, discretionary power in foreign relations, and courts should interpret such statutes as written rather than applying a "thumb on the scale" against the Executive.
*   **Nondelegation:** He argued that the power to impose duties on imports is not a "core legislative power" subject to the nondelegation doctrine, as it was historically viewed as a prerogative power of the Crown (now the Executive) regarding foreign commerce.

**Justice Thomas (Concurring in the Judgment/Dissenting on other grounds):**
Justice Thomas filed a separate dissent arguing that the nondelegation doctrine does not apply to the power to impose duties on imports at all. He posited that the Constitution only forbids delegating "core legislative power" (rules setting conditions for deprivations of life, liberty, or property). He argued that importing goods is a "privilege," not a right, and thus the power to tax imports is not a core legislative power that Congress must retain. Therefore, Congress could delegate this power to the President without limit, and IEEPA's broad language was sufficient.

### 5. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

*   **Extension of Major Questions to Foreign Affairs:** The most striking aspect of the decision is the Court's explicit application of the "major questions doctrine" to a foreign affairs and national security context. Traditionally, the Court has been highly deferential to the President in foreign policy, often citing *Curtiss-Wright*. By rejecting a "foreign affairs exception" to the major questions doctrine, the Court has fundamentally altered the balance of power, asserting that even in emergencies involving foreign threats, the specific power to tax cannot be inferred from ambiguous statutory text.
*   **The "Magic Words" Requirement:** The majority opinion effectively establishes a "magic words" requirement for the delegation of tariff power. The Court held that because IEEPA did not use the specific words "tariff," "duty," or "tax," the power was not granted. This contrasts with the dissent's view (and the *Algonquin* precedent) that the substance of the power matters more than the specific label, provided the statutory language is broad enough to encompass the action.
*   **Historical Precedent as a Barrier:** The Court placed significant weight on the fact that no President had ever used IEEPA to impose tariffs in its 50-year history. This "lack of historical precedent" was treated as a decisive factor in finding that Congress did not intend to delegate such power, a novel application of historical practice in statutory interpretation.
*   **The "Regulate" vs. "Tax" Distinction:** The decision reinforces a rigid separation between regulatory and taxing powers, even when a tax is used for regulatory purposes (e.g., tariffs to stop drug trafficking). The Court rejected the argument that a regulatory statute can implicitly include a taxing power, a stance that could have significant implications for other administrative agencies attempting to use regulatory statutes to raise revenue.
*   **Future Implications for Trade Policy:** The decision creates a significant hurdle for future Presidents wishing to use emergency powers to impose broad tariffs. It suggests that unless Congress explicitly amends IEEPA or passes new legislation using specific tariff terminology, the President's ability to use tariffs as a tool of foreign policy during emergencies is severely curtailed, potentially forcing a return to more cumbersome statutory processes (like Section 232 or Section 301) which have their own procedural requirements.
