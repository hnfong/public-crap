Okay, here’s a breakdown of the *Secretary for Justice v. Cheng Ka Yee and 3 Others* case, addressing your three requests with clear separation and detail:

**1. Summary of the Facts**

The case revolves around four primary school teachers and a former classmate who were charged under the Crimes Ordinance for obtaining access to a computer with the intent to dishonest gain. Specifically, they were accused of using phones and a computer to transmit questions intended for competitive admission interviews at a government-subsidized primary school to third parties. The key facts are:

*   **The Interview Process:** The school used a competitive interview process for admissions.
*   **The Briefing:** The teachers received a folder containing interview questions and a marking scheme at a briefing.
*   **Photographic Transmission:**  Several teachers (the first and second) took photos of the folder contents using their phones and sent them via WhatsApp. The first respondent sent them to a friend, and the second respondent sent them to another teacher. The third respondent typed the questions into a Word document on a school computer and emailed it to others. The fourth respondent took photos of the questions on her phone and shared them via WhatsApp.
*   **The Charges:** Each respondent was charged with obtaining access to a computer with dishonest intent.
*   **The Acquittal:** The Magistrate acquitted all four respondents, citing two main reasons: (1) a lack of evidence that the teacher in charge had instructed the teachers to maintain confidentiality, and (2) a reasonable doubt regarding the respondents’ dishonest intent.
*   **Appeals and Review:** The Secretary for Justice appealed, and the Magistrate confirmed the acquittal. The Secretary for Justice then requested a statement of case from the Court of First Instance, which focused on the interpretation of the law regarding “access to a computer.”
*   **Judge’s Ruling:** Deputy High Court Judge C P Pang ruled that the prosecution must prove the unauthorized extraction and use of information from a computer, rejecting the argument that the respondents could be charged simply for obtaining access to a computer belonging to the school.

**2. Summary of the Arguments**

*   **Secretary for Justice (Appellant):** The prosecution argued that the respondents *did* commit the offense of obtaining access to a computer with dishonest intent. They contended that the respondents’ actions – taking photos, transmitting the questions, and creating a digital copy – constituted “access” to the computer, regardless of whether it was their own. They emphasized the broader intent of the law to prevent dishonest use of computers and argued that the restrictive interpretation proposed by the Judge would undermine the purpose of the legislation. They presented a list of potential offenses that could be committed using the same methods, arguing that these cases should be prosecuted under the law.
*   **Respondents (Appellees):** The respondents argued that they did *not* commit the offense. They maintained that the Magistrate correctly determined that there was no evidence of dishonest intent and that the prosecution’s case was based on a misinterpretation of the law. They argued that the law was intended to punish unauthorized *extraction and use* of information, not simply access to a computer, and that their actions did not meet this threshold. They highlighted the lack of evidence that they had acted with dishonest intent and that the Magistrate’s decision was based on reasonable doubt.


**3. Summary of the Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The core of this case lies in interpreting the meaning of “obtaining access to a computer” as defined in section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance. The Court of First Instance ultimately ruled that the prosecution must prove the unauthorized extraction and use of information from a computer for a conviction to be secured. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the legal principles established:

*   **The Core Definition of “Obtaining Access”:** The Court emphasized that “obtaining access” to a computer, within the context of section 161(1)(c), does not simply mean gaining access to a computer. It requires a more active element – the unauthorized extraction and use of information *from* that computer. The Court rejected the argument that merely possessing or accessing a computer, even if it belonged to the individual, was sufficient to constitute a violation of the law.
*   **The Importance of Intent (Dishonest Intent):** The Court reaffirmed the requirement of “dishonest intent” as a crucial element of the offense. The prosecution must prove that the respondent acted with the intention to deceive or cause loss. The Magistrate’s finding that there was reasonable doubt regarding the respondents’ dishonest intent was sufficient to justify the acquittal.
*   **The Role of the Legislative History:** The Court considered the legislative history of the Computer Crimes Ordinance, particularly the Memorandum for Legislative Council and the Second Reading Debate. These documents revealed the intention of the legislature to create an offense targeting the *misuse* of computers, specifically to prevent dishonest gain or loss. The deletion of the interpretive provision in the Bill regarding “causing a computer to perform any function” was significant, as it indicated a desire to limit the scope of the offense to unauthorized extraction and use.
*   **The Distinction Between Access and Extraction/Use:** The Court drew a clear distinction between “access” to a computer and “extraction and use” of information from it. Access, in this context, is merely the act of gaining entry to the computer, while extraction and use involves actively obtaining and utilizing data stored on the computer in a dishonest manner.
*   **Novel or Controversial Points:**
    *   **The Smartphone as a Computer:** The case implicitly addressed the question of whether a smartphone constitutes a “computer” for the purposes of the ordinance.
