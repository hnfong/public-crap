**Sec. 50101. ONSHORE OIL AND GAS LEASING.**

It mandates the Interior Secretary to resume quarterly onshore oil and gas lease sales in states like Wyoming, New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Nevada, and Alaska, with at least 50% of available parcels offered for development. The bill also requires replacement lease sales if any scheduled sale is canceled or if less than 75% of offered acreage receives bids, and expands the definition of "eligible lands" to include those open for leasing under approved plans or designated as available.

Alaska lease sales must offer at least 1 million acres per sale, with 70% of revenues going to Alaska starting in fiscal year 2034.
