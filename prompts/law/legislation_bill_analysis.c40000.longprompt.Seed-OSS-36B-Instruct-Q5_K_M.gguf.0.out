Got it, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I understand the bill thoroughly. Let's start with Question A: summary, purpose, major themes.

For Question A, the purpose is clearly stated in the Explanatory Memorandum: protect critical infrastructure computer systems, regulate their operators, and provide for investigating/responding to threats/incidents. Major themes would include regulation of CI operators, obligations on those operators, powers for regulating authorities (Commissioner and designated authorities), incident response, investigations, and appeals.

Question B: Who is impacted? Clearly CI operators (organizations running critical infrastructures like energy, IT, banking, transport, healthcare, telecoms). Also, regulating authorities (Commissioner, designated authorities like Monetary Authority, Communications Authority). Maybe other organizations involved in critical systems, like those with control over critical computer systems. Who needs to be familiar? CI operators definitely, because they have obligations. Regulating authorities, since they have new powers. Maybe legal professionals, IT professionals, because of the technical and legal aspects. Who should be concerned? CI operators that don't comply—they face fines. Also, any organization that handles critical infrastructure computer systems, as they might be subject to investigations or requirements.

Question C: New obligations. Let's look at Part 4: Obligations of CI Operator. Division 1: maintain office in HK, notify operator changes, set up computer-system security management unit. Division 2: notify material changes to critical systems, submit/implement security management plans, conduct risk assessments, arrange audits. Division 3: participate in security drills, submit/implement emergency response plans, notify security incidents. These are all new obligations on CI operators. New rights/powers: Regulating authorities (Commissioner, designated authorities) get powers to give directions, issue codes of practice, require information, conduct investigations (with warrants), prosecute offences (designated authorities), exempt CI operators (Commissioner), appoint authorized officers, delegate functions. Also, the Commissioner can step in for designated authorities if necessary.

Question D: Liabilities—civil and criminal. Let's go through the bill:

Criminal offences:
- Clause 7(8): CI operator fails to comply with direction from regulating authority—summary: $3M, continuing $60k/day; indictment: $5M, $100k/day.
- Clause 18(1): Organization fails to comply with info requirements (clauses 14-17)—if CI operator: summary $3M/$60k, indictment $5M/$100k; else: summary $300k/$30k, indictment $500k/$50k.
- Clause 19(4): CI operator fails to maintain office in HK or notify address—summary $300k/$30k, indictment $500k/$50k.
- Clause 20(2): CI operator fails to notify operator changes—summary $3M/$60k, indictment $5M/$100k.
- Clause 21(7): CI operator fails to notify appointment of security unit supervisor or changes—summary $300k/$30k, indictment $500k/$50k.
- Clause 22(4): CI operator fails to notify material changes to systems—summary $300k/$30k, indictment $500k/$50k.
- Clause 23(7): CI operator fails to submit security management plan or revisions—summary $300k/$30k, indictment $500k/$50k.
- Clause 24(8): CI operator fails to conduct risk assessments or comply with authority requirements—summary $300k/$30k, indictment $500k/$50k.
- Clause 25(10): CI operator fails to conduct audits or comply with authority requirements—summary $300k/$30k, indictment $500k/$50k.
- Clause 26(3): CI operator fails to participate in security drill—summary $3M, indictment $5M.
- Clause 27(7): CI operator fails to submit emergency response plan or revisions—summary $300k/$30k, indictment $500k/$50k.
- Clause 28(5): CI operator fails to notify incidents, submit records/reports—summary $3M, indictment $5M.
- Clause 42(1): Organization fails to comply with specified requirements (early intervention/investigations)—summary $300k, indictment $500k.
- Clause 45(1): Organization fails to comply with investigation requirements (Part 6)—summary $300k, indictment $500k.
- Clause 58(1)-(2): Person contravenes secrecy provisions (clause 57)—summary: level 6 fine + 6 months jail; indictment: $1M + 2 years jail.

Civil liabilities: The bill mentions in clause 60(1): compliance with directions/requirements doesn't incur civil liability. Clause 60(2): good faith performance of functions doesn't incur civil liability (except Government). So maybe no new civil liabilities beyond that, but mostly criminal. Wait, are there any civil liabilities? Let's check: The question says "ALL liabilities introduced, including civil and criminal". The bill mostly has criminal, but clause 60 is about immunity from civil liability, so maybe no new civil liabilities, but the criminal ones are extensive.

Need to make sure for each liability, the condition: e.g., failure to comply with direction (clause 7), failure to provide info (clause 18), etc.</seed:think>### Question A: Summary, Purpose, and Major Themes  


#### **Purpose**  
The **Protection of Critical Infrastructures (Computer Systems) Bill** aims to:  
1. Secure the computer systems of Hong Kong’s critical infrastructures (CIs).  
2. Regulate operators of these CIs (CI operators).  
3. Establish mechanisms to investigate and respond to computer-system security threats and incidents (CSSIs) involving CI computer systems.  


#### **Major Themes**  
1. **Regulation of CI Operators**: Imposes strict obligations on CI operators to manage cybersecurity risks, report incidents, and maintain security protocols.  
2. **Role of Regulating Authorities**: Empowers two key bodies—the **Commissioner of Critical Infrastructure (Computer-system Security)** (Commissioner) and **designated authorities** (e.g., Monetary Authority, Communications Authority)—to oversee CIs, enforce compliance, and investigate threats.  
3. **Incident Response and Threat Mitigation**: Requires CI operators to report CSSIs promptly, participate in security drills, and implement emergency plans. Grants regulating authorities powers to conduct investigations (with warrants) and intervene early to address threats.  
4. **Procedural Safeguards**: Includes appeal mechanisms for CI operators, secrecy provisions to protect sensitive information, and immunity for good-faith compliance with obligations.  


### Question B: Impact, Stakeholders, and Concerns  


#### **Who Is Impacted?**  
- **CI Operators**: Organizations designated to operate critical infrastructures (e.g., banks, telecom providers, healthcare facilities, energy companies) listed in Schedule 1 (sectors like banking, healthcare, transport, IT).  
- **Regulating Authorities**: The Commissioner and designated authorities (e.g., Monetary Authority, Communications Authority) tasked with enforcing the bill.  
- **Third Parties**: Organizations with control over critical computer systems (even if not CI operators) may be subject to investigation requirements.  
- **General Public**: Indirectly, as the bill aims to protect societal and economic stability via secure CIs.  


#### **Who Needs to Be Familiar?**  
- **CI Operators**: Must comply with new obligations (e.g., security plans, incident reporting).  
- **Regulating Authorities**: Need to exercise new powers (e.g., issuing directions, conducting investigations).  
- **Legal/IT Professionals**: Advising CI operators on compliance, or representing them in appeals/investigations.  
- **Policy Makers**: Responsible for implementing the bill (e.g., Secretary for Security amending schedules).  


#### **Who Should Be Concerned?**  
- **Non-Compliant CI Operators**: Face severe fines (up to $5M on indictment) for violating obligations (e.g., failing to report incidents, neglecting security audits).  
- **Organizations Handling CI Systems**: Even non-designated entities controlling critical computer systems may be subject to regulatory scrutiny.  
- **Privacy Advocates**: Secrecy provisions (Clause 57) could raise concerns about balancing cybersecurity with data privacy.  


### Question C: New Obligations and Rights/Powers  


#### **New Obligations (Imposed On CI Operators)**  
CI operators are obligated to:  
1. **Organizational Compliance**:  
   - Maintain a physical office in Hong Kong and notify address changes (Clause 19).  
   - Report operator changes (e.g., new owners of a CI) within 1 month (Clause 20).  
   - Establish and maintain a computer-system security management unit (CSSMU) with a qualified supervisor (Clause 21).  

2. **Preventive Security Measures**:  
   - Notify material changes to critical computer systems (e.g., design, configuration) within 1 month (Clause 22).  
   - Submit and implement a computer-system security management plan (covering risk assessment, access control, etc.) (Clause 23; Schedule 3).  
   - Conduct annual computer-system security risk assessments (Clause 24; Schedule 4) and biennial independent audits (Clause 25; Schedule 5).  

3. **Incident Response**:  
   - Participate in Commissioner-led security drills (Clause 26).  
   - Submit and implement an emergency response plan for CSSIs (Clause 27; Schedule 3).  
   - Report CSSIs to the Commissioner within strict timelines (e.g., 12 hours for disruptive incidents; Schedule 6).  


#### **New Rights/Powers (Granted To Regulating Authorities)**  
1. **Commissioner’s Powers**:  
   - Designate CIs, CI operators, and critical computer systems (Part 3).  
   - Issue codes of practice for cybersecurity compliance (Clause 8).  
   - Give binding directions to CI operators to fix non-compliance (Clause 7).  
   - Conduct early interventions and investigations into threats/incidents (with warrants; Part 5).  
   - Exempt CI operators from obligations if in the public interest (Clause 55).  
   - Coordinate with designated authorities and government departments (Clause 4(f)).  

2. **Designated Authorities’ Powers**:  
   - Regulate sector-specific CIs (e.g., Monetary Authority for banking, Communications Authority for telecoms; Schedule 2).  
   - Require CI operators to provide information for regulatory purposes (Clauses 14–17).  
   - Prosecute certain offences (e.g., non-compliance with directions, failure to provide info; Clause 56).  
   - Appoint authorized officers to enforce the bill (Clause 51).  

3. **Shared Powers**:  
   - Both the Commissioner and designated authorities may:  
     - Issue warrants to enter premises or access electronic devices during investigations (Parts 5–6).  
     - Impose penalties for non-compliance (e.g., fines up to $5M on indictment).
