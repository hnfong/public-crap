### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case of MANULIFE (INTERNATIONAL) LTD v. CHONG WAI LING ALSO KNOWN AS CHONG WAI LING FRANKIE [2018] HKCA 86 involves a dispute between an insurance company, Manulife, and its former agent, Chong Wai Ling. Manulife had offered Chong a position as a unit manager and insurance adviser, contingent upon her signing three contractual documents: an Offer Letter, a Career Agentâ€™s Agreement (CAA), and a Producer Loan Agreement (PLA). According to these documents, Manulife provided Chong with a join-in incentive bonus of HK$242,000 and a monthly allowance of HK$37,000 for two years, totaling HK$1,130,000. This amount was set off against commissions and bonuses payable to Chong, resulting in a net amount of HK$975,355.56 that Chong owed to Manulife.

Chong commenced her service with Manulife on 25 October 2012 and resigned on 29 June 2015. Manulife terminated the CAA on 22 July 2015. On 22 September 2015, Manulife demanded repayment of the Loan under the Offer Letter, CAA, and PLA. Chong did not pay and Manulife subsequently filed a lawsuit against her. Chong argued that she had relied on oral representations made by Ray Fok, a representative of Manulife, who had not mentioned that the join-in incentive bonus and monthly allowance were loans that needed to be repaid. She also claimed that the PLA and CAA were unenforceable as they were signed merely for administrative purposes and did not reflect the true agreement between the parties.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments

**Manulife's Arguments:**
- The PLA and CAA are legally binding documents that clearly outline the terms of the agreement, including the repayment of the Loan.
- The PLA and CAA were not signed merely for administrative purposes but were intended to create legal rights and obligations.
- Clause 5.2 of the PLA, which requires repayment of the Loan upon termination of the CAA, is not a penalty clause but a contractual obligation for repayment.
- There is no serious material factual dispute as to the nature and content of the agreement between the parties, making the case suitable for summary judgment.

**Chong's Arguments:**
- The PLA and CAA were signed merely for administrative purposes and do not reflect the true agreement between the parties.
- The true agreement was an oral one made between Ray Fok and Chong, under which the join-in incentive bonus and monthly allowance were not subject to repayment.
- Clause 5.2 of the PLA is a penalty clause and should be unenforceable.
- There is a serious material factual dispute as to the nature and content of the agreement between the parties, making the case unsuitable for summary judgment.

### 3. Summary of the Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The Court of Appeal in this case established several key legal principles:

**1. Enforceability of Contractual Documents:**
The Court held that it is not credible for a multinational insurance company to recruit agents solely through oral agreements. The signing of the Offer Letter, CAA, and PLA, which contain the core terms and conditions of the agreement, indicates that these documents were intended to be legally binding. The Court found that Chong's acknowledgment of achieving the business volume targets set out in the PLA and CAA further supported the enforceability of these documents.

**2. Nature of the PLA and CAA:**
The Court determined that the PLA and CAA were not merely administrative documents but were intended to create legal rights and obligations between the parties. The PLA specifically provided for the repayment of the Loan upon termination of the CAA, which the Court found to be a contractual obligation rather than a penalty clause.

**3. Penalty Clause Analysis:**
The Court applied the principle that a penalty clause only applies to sums payable following a breach of contract, not to primary obligations. Clause 5.2 of the PLA, which required repayment of the Loan upon termination of the CAA, was found to be a contractual obligation rather than a penalty clause. The Court noted that the clause was drafted in a neutral manner, without any reference to wrongful termination, and that the repayment obligation was based on the Loan amount rather than any exorbitant or unconscionable damages.

**4. Summary Judgment and Factual Disputes:**
The Court held that the case was suitable for summary judgment as there was no serious material factual dispute as to the nature and content of the agreement between the parties. The Court found that Chong's arguments were not supported by the evidence and that the PLA and CAA clearly outlined the terms of the agreement, including the repayment obligation.

**5. Burden of Proof for Leave to Appeal:**
The Court emphasized that the defendant bears the burden of showing that the appeal has a reasonable prospect of success. Unless the defendant can demonstrate that the judge misunderstood the evidence, overlooked important evidence, or made a clear error in law, the Court will not interfere with the findings of fact.

These principles highlight the importance of clear contractual terms, the enforceability of written agreements, and the distinction between penalty clauses and contractual obligations. The case also underscores the significance of the burden of proof in leave to appeal applications and the Court's reluctance to overturn findings of fact unless there is a clear error or new evidence.
