Okay, here’s a breakdown of the *NG KA LING AND ANOTHER V. THE DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION* case, addressing your three requests with a detailed and thorough response:

**1. Summary of the Facts**

The case revolves around the status of Chinese nationals born on the mainland who have a Hong Kong permanent resident parent and therefore claim the right of abode in Hong Kong under Article 24(2) of the Basic Law.  The core issue is whether these individuals qualify as permanent residents despite the implementation of a new immigration scheme (the No 3 Ordinance) introduced after Hong Kong’s handover.

Here’s a breakdown of the key factual elements:

*   **The Applicants:** Four individuals – Ng Ka Ling & Ng Tan Tan, Tsui Kuen Nang, and Cheung Lai Wah – all claimed to fall under Article 24(2)’s third category (children of mainland-born parents with a Hong Kong permanent resident parent).
*   **Post-Handover Context:** The case arose after the handover in 1997, with the Basic Law taking effect. The No 3 Ordinance was enacted shortly after to manage immigration and the right of abode.
*   **The No 3 Ordinance:** This ordinance introduced a new system requiring individuals claiming the right of abode to obtain a “one-way permit” from the mainland authorities before being allowed to land in Hong Kong. This permit was linked to a certificate of entitlement issued by the Hong Kong Director of Immigration.
*   **Pre-Existing Rights:** The applicants had arrived in Hong Kong before the No 3 Ordinance and, prior to that, enjoyed the right of abode.
*   **Dispute over Interpretation:** The central dispute was over the interpretation of Article 24(3) (which guarantees the right of abode) in light of the No 3 Ordinance and the requirement for a one-way permit. The Director of Immigration argued that the permit was a necessary condition for establishing the right of abode.
*   **Judicial Review:** The applicants challenged the Director’s decision to deny them the right of abode, leading to multiple appeals.



**2. Summary of the Arguments**

*   **The Director of Immigration (Respondent):**
    *   The No 3 Ordinance is constitutional and necessary to manage immigration and ensure compliance with mainland regulations.
    *   Article 22(4) of the Basic Law, which regulates entry from mainland China, effectively limits the right of abode to those who obtain a one-way permit.
    *   The applicants’ claim to the right of abode is conditional on obtaining this permit, and they have not met this condition.
    *   The court should not interfere with the implementation of the No 3 Ordinance.
    *   The retrospective application of the No 3 Ordinance is justified because it was enacted to maintain the existing system of immigration control.

*   **The Applicants (Appellants):**
    *   The No 3 Ordinance is unconstitutional because it restricts the right of abode guaranteed by Article 24(3) without a clear basis in the Basic Law.
    *   Article 22(4) does not qualify the right of abode; it simply regulates entry from mainland China.
    *   The requirement for a one-way permit is an unnecessary and unduly restrictive condition that undermines the principle of “one country, two systems.”
    *   The court should sever the unconstitutional provisions of the No 3 Ordinance and uphold the existing right of abode.
    *   The retrospective application of the No 3 Ordinance is unlawful because it deprives individuals of rights they previously enjoyed.



**3. Summary of the Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

This case is a landmark decision concerning the interpretation of the Basic Law and the balance between Hong Kong’s autonomy and the overarching authority of the Chinese Constitution. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the key legal principles established:

*   **Judicial Review Jurisdiction:** The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) has the jurisdiction to interpret the Basic Law and declare legislative acts of the National People’s Congress (NPC) or its Standing Committee (SC) inconsistent with the Basic Law. This is a crucial principle for upholding the “one country, two systems” framework.  The court explicitly rejected the argument that the Hong Kong courts were limited to reviewing the *existence* of acts, not their validity.
*   **Interpretation of the Basic Law – A Purposive Approach:** The court adopted a purposive approach to interpreting the Basic Law, emphasizing the need to consider the overall purpose and context of the provisions.  This means looking beyond the literal wording to understand the underlying intent of the drafters.
*   **The “One Country, Two Systems” Principle:** The court repeatedly stressed the importance of upholding the “one country, two systems” principle, which is the cornerstone of Hong Kong’s constitutional framework.  The right of abode is central to this principle, providing a key safeguard for Hong Kong residents.
*   **Article 24(3) and the Right of Abode:** The court held that Article 24(3) guarantees the right of abode to permanent residents without qualification.  It rejected the argument that Article 22(4) could be used to restrict this right.
*   **Severability of Unconstitutional Provisions:** The court ruled that the unconstitutional provisions of the No 3 Ordinance could be severed from the rest of the ordinance, preserving the core principles of the Basic Law. This is a key principle of statutory interpretation – that an invalid provision should be removed without invalidating the entire law.
*   **The Retrospective Application of the No 3 Ordinance:** The court found that the No 3 Ordinance’s retrospective application was unconstitutional because it deprived individuals of rights they previously enjoyed.  It reasoned that the ordinance created a new condition (the one-way permit) that was not present before its enactment.
*   **The Nature of the Preparatory Committee:** The court determined that the Preparatory Committee established in 1990 to oversee the transition to sovereignty was a legally constituted body within the framework of the Basic Law. This was crucial to validating the legislation enacted by the committee.
*   **The Role of the Joint Declaration:** The court acknowledged the importance of the Joint Declaration in establishing the Basic Law and the “one country, two systems” framework, but ultimately held that the Basic Law itself should be the primary source of legal authority.

**Novel or Controversial Points:**

*   **Expanding Judicial Review Jurisdiction:** The case significantly expanded the scope of judicial review over legislative acts of the NPC and SC, establishing a precedent for the CFA to scrutinize such acts for consistency with the Basic Law. This was a controversial decision, as it challenged the traditional view that Hong Kong courts had limited jurisdiction over actions taken by the central government.
*   **Reinterpreting Article 22(4):** The court’s interpretation of Article 22(4) as not qualifying the right of abode was a key element of the decision. It effectively rejected the argument that the mainland’s immigration regulations could be used to restrict the rights guaranteed by the Basic Law.
*   **The Severability Doctrine Applied to Constitutional Rights:** The application of the severability doctrine to a constitutional right (the right of abode) was a novel and important aspect of the case. It demonstrated the court’s commitment to upholding the Basic Law even in the face of unconstitutional legislation.
