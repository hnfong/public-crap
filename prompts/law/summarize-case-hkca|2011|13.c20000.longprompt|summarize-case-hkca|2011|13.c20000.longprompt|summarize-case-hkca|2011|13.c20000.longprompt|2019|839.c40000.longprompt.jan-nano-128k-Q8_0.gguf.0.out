Okay, I need to tackle this case summary. Let me start by understanding the case. The case is HKSAR v. Wong Cho Shing and Others [2019] HKCA 839. The appellants are police officers involved in an assault on Tsang Kin Chiu during the Occupy Central movement. They were convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (Charge 1) and common assault (Charge 2). The main issues are about the admissibility of open-source evidence like videos and photos, the identification of the officers, and the sentence.

First, the facts: On 15 October 2014, during a police operation to clear protesters, Tsang was splashing liquid on the underpass. Police tried to stop him, leading to a struggle where some OC foam was sprayed. Then, Tsang was handed over to officers D1-D6, and later, D5 slapped him in the interview room. The prosecution used videos from TVB, Apple Daily, ATV, Now TV, and photos from those sources. The defense challenged the authenticity and admissibility of these materials, arguing that they weren't properly authenticated. The trial judge admitted them, but the defense appealed, leading to the High Court of the HKSAR.

Now, the arguments. The prosecution's case is that the videos and photos are authentic and show the assault. They rely on the evidence of the police officers involved and Tsang's testimony. The defense argues that the videos and photos lack provenance, could be tampered with, and that the standard of proof should be the balance of probabilities, not just prima facie. They also challenge the identification of the officers, especially D4 and D7, saying there's no witness identification and the judge's own identification is unsafe.

For the legal principles, the court discussed the admissibility of open-source material. The judge applied the "if believed" test, which is different from the defense's argument that it should be "on the balance of probabilities." The court found that the prosecution met the standard of proving authenticity beyond reasonable doubt, using Tsang's testimony and the evidence of TVB technicians. The court also addressed the issue of the judge's own identification of the officers, emphasizing that the judge's role is to assess relevance and authenticity, not to make the final determination of guilt. The court rejected the defense's argument that the judge's identification was unsafe, especially for D1, D2, D3, D5, D6, but found D4 and D7's convictions unsafe due to lack of witness identification.

The case is notable for the use of open-source evidence in a criminal trial, the high-profile nature of the Occupy Central movement, and the court's detailed analysis of the videos and photos. The court's decision on the admissibility of the videos was controversial because it allowed the prosecution to use evidence without the photographers/cameramen testifying, which the defense argued was unfair. The court also emphasized the importance of Tsang's testimony in establishing the authenticity of the videos, which is a key point in the ratio decidendi.

I need to make sure I cover all these points in the summary. The legal principles are about the admissibility of open-source evidence, the standard of proof for authenticity, the role of the judge in assessing evidence, and the identification of suspects. The court's approach to the "if believed" test versus the "balance of probabilities" is a point of contention. Also, the court's decision to quash D4 and D7's convictions because of the lack of witness identification is a significant part of the case.

I should structure the answer with the four parts as per the tasks. The first part is the facts, the second the arguments, the third the legal principles, and the fourth the striking aspects. Make sure the legal principles are detailed, especially the part about the standard of proof and the judge's role. Also, mention the use of Tsang's testimony as a key factor in the authenticity of the videos. The case is remarkable because it's a high-profile case involving police officers and the use of open-source media, which is a new area of law. The court's detailed analysis of the videos and the defense's arguments about the judge's identification are also notable.

### 1. **Facts of the Case**  
The case involves seven Hong Kong police officers (appellants) who were convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm (Charge 1) and common assault (Charge 2) against Tsang Kin Chiu during a police operation on 15 October 2014 at the Lung Wo Road Government Building Pump Station in Admiralty. The officers were part of the "Quick Response Team" (QRT A2-2) and other units involved in clearing protesters during the Occupy Central movement. The prosecution alleges that the officers, including D1-D6, assaulted Tsang after he was handed over to them, while D5, a police officer, slapped him in the interview room at Central Police Station. The trial judge admitted video recordings and photographs from sources like TVB, Apple Daily, ATV, and Now TV, as well as CCTV footage, to prove the assault. The defense challenged the admissibility of these materials, arguing that they lacked provenance, were potentially tampered with, and that the prosecution failed to meet the burden of proof for their authenticity. The court later dismissed appeals against conviction for D1-D6 but quashed the convictions of D4 and D7 due to insufficient identification evidence. The sentencing was 2 years for each of the first six, with D5 receiving an additional 1 month for Charge 2, but the court reduced D4 and D7’s sentences as their convictions were overturned.

### 2. **Arguments of the Two Parties**  
**Prosecution’s Case**:  
The prosecution argued that the video recordings and photographs were admissible and authentic, relying on the testimony of TVB technicians (PW8, PW9, PW10) and Tsang’s identification of himself in the footage. They contended that the videos, including the enhanced version (Exhibit P1(h)), clearly showed the assault at the Substation and the involvement of the officers. The prosecution emphasized that Tsang’s testimony, which included a detailed account of the events, corroborated the videos and photos. They also highlighted that the videos were broadcast live or shortly after the events, and that the police officers involved (e.g., D1-D6) were identified through their clothing, facial features, and roles in the operation. The prosecution maintained that the videos and photos were not only relevant but also authentic beyond reasonable doubt, as the judge had accepted the evidence of the TVB team and Tsang’s recollection.  

**Defense’s Case**:  
The defense challenged the admissibility of the open-source evidence, arguing that the prosecution failed to meet the legal standard for proving authenticity. They contended that the videos and photos lacked provenance, were not produced by the police, and that the prosecution did not call the photographers or cameramen to testify. The defense also argued that the judge should have applied a higher standard of proof (balance of probabilities) rather than the "prima facie" test, as the videos were not produced in court and the prosecution’s reliance on Tsang’s testimony (which he later claimed was inconsistent) was problematic. They further disputed the judge’s identification of the officers, particularly D4 and D7, arguing that the videos did not show them in the assault footage and that the judge’s reliance on his own observations was unsafe. The defense also raised concerns about the fairness of the trial, including the failure to produce the original TVB Blu-ray discs and the potential for the prosecution to manipulate the footage.

### 3. **Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**  
The case centers on the admissibility of open-source video and photographic evidence in criminal trials, the standard of proof for authenticity, and the role of the trial judge in assessing such evidence. The court’s decision is grounded in several key legal principles:  

#### **A. Admissibility of Open-Source Evidence**  
The court held that the admissibility of open-source material (e.g., videos and photos from the Internet) does not require the prosecution to prove its authenticity on the balance of probabilities, but rather to establish a "prima facie" case of authenticity. This was based on the precedent in *HKSAR v Lee Chi Fai* [2003] 3 HKLRD 751, which applied the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal’s decision in *R v Murphy* [1990] NI 306. The court emphasized that the trial judge’s role is to determine whether the evidence is relevant and whether it meets the "prima facie" standard of authenticity, which can be satisfied through circumstantial evidence (e.g., the prosecution’s own witnesses, Tsang’s testimony, and the continuity of the footage). The judge was allowed to rely on the prosecution’s evidence of the TVB footage’s provenance (e.g., it was broadcast live and later burned onto Blu-ray discs without editing) and Tsang’s identification of himself in the footage to establish authenticity. The court rejected the defense’s argument that the prosecution must prove authenticity on the balance of probabilities, stating that this would shift the burden of proof to the jury, which is not appropriate for admissibility.  

#### **B. Standard of Proof for Authenticity**  
The court clarified that the standard for proving the authenticity of video recordings is not the same as the standard for proving guilt. The prosecution must demonstrate that the evidence is "prima facie" authentic, which is a lower threshold than the "balance of probabilities" required for the ultimate issue of guilt. This was based on the reasoning in *R v Quinn* [2011] NICA 19, where the court held that the prosecution need only show that the evidence is "prima facie" authentic for it to be admissible. The court rejected the defense’s claim that the prosecution’s reliance on Tsang’s testimony (which he later said was inconsistent) was flawed, noting that Tsang’s evidence was not entirely contradictory but rather provided a contextual basis for the judge to accept the videos as authentic.  

#### **C. Role of the Trial Judge in Assessing Evidence**  
The court affirmed that the trial judge has a "gatekeeper" role in determining the admissibility of evidence, including the authenticity of video recordings. The judge is not required to act as a "gatekeeper" in the same way as the jury, but must ensure that the evidence is relevant and meets the "prima facie" standard. The court emphasized that the judge’s evaluation of the evidence (e.g., comparing the TVB footage with other recordings and Tsang’s testimony) is a matter of law, not fact, and that the judge’s findings on authenticity are binding unless overturned on appeal. The court also rejected the defense’s argument that the judge’s identification of the officers was unsafe, noting that the judge’s analysis was based on the prosecution’s evidence and Tsang’s testimony, which provided a "foundational" basis for the identification.  

#### **D. Identification of Suspects**  
The court held that the identification of the officers could be based on circumstantial evidence, including their clothing, roles in the operation, and the continuity of the events depicted in the videos. For example, the judge identified D1 through his distinctive clothing (a white shirt with an inverted "V" at the front) and his role as a senior officer in the QRT A2-2 team. The court also accepted that Tsang’s testimony about the sequence of events (e.g., being carried face down by the officers) provided a "cogent" basis for the judge to identify the officers. However, the court found that D4 and D7’s convictions were unsafe because there was no identification by any witness in the footage or photographs, and the judge’s own identification of D4 was based on a partial view of a face, which was insufficient to confirm his presence in the assault.  

#### **E. Sentencing of Police Officers**  
The court emphasized that police officers who break the law must be punished severely to deter others and maintain public confidence in the police force. This was based on the precedent in *HKSAR v Hui Man Tai* [2008] 22 HKCFAR 1, where the court stated that such officers must be made examples to uphold the rule of law. The court rejected the defense’s argument that the sentences were excessive, noting that the officers’ actions were "very serious" and that their careers and pensions would be affected by the convictions. However, the court reduced the sentences of D1-D6 by 6 months, citing their long careers and the "deterrent" nature of the punishment.  

#### **F. Controversial Aspects**  
The case is notable for its detailed analysis of the admissibility of open-source evidence, which is a relatively new area of law in Hong Kong. The court’s reliance on Tsang’s testimony to authenticate the videos was controversial, as the defense argued that this created a circularity in the trial process. The court also faced criticism for not requiring the prosecution to produce the original TVB Blu-ray discs, which the defense claimed were necessary for a fair trial. However, the court rejected this argument, citing the principle that the prosecution is not required to produce the best evidence (e.g., the original discs) if the copies are sufficient to meet the "prima facie" standard.

### 4. **Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case**  
The case is remarkable for several reasons:  
- **High-Profile Context**: The trial occurred during the Occupy Central movement, a significant protest in Hong Kong, which added political sensitivity to the case. The court’s decision to convict police officers for their actions during the protest underscored the tension between law enforcement and public accountability.  
- **Use of Open-Source Evidence**: The prosecution relied heavily on videos and photos from the Internet, which were not produced by the police. This raised questions about the admissibility of such evidence in criminal trials, as the defense argued that the lack of provenance and the potential for tampering made them unreliable. The court’s acceptance of these materials, however, set a precedent for the use of open-source evidence in Hong Kong.  
- **Tsang’s Testimony**: Tsang’s identification of himself in the videos and his detailed account of the events were central to the prosecution’s case. The court’s reliance on his testimony to authenticate the videos was controversial, as the defense claimed it was inconsistent with his own evidence. However, the court found that his testimony was not entirely contradictory and that it provided a contextual basis for the videos to be considered authentic.  
- **Judicial Identification**: The judge’s identification of D1-D6 was based on circumstantial evidence, including their clothing and roles in the operation. The court found this identification to be valid, but the judge’s identification of D4 and D7 was deemed unsafe due to the lack of witness identification. This highlights the importance of cross-examination and the role of the trial judge in assessing the reliability of evidence.  
- **Sentencing Discrepancy**: The court reduced the sentences of D1-D6 by 6 months, citing their long careers and the need for deterrence, but quashed D4 and D7’s convictions. This reflects the court’s recognition of the unique circumstances of the case, including the high stakes for police officers and the need to balance punishment with the broader implications for public confidence in the police force.  

The case also underscores the challenges of using digital evidence in criminal trials, particularly when the source of the evidence is not directly accessible to the defense. The court’s detailed analysis of the videos and photos, combined with its reliance on Tsang’s testimony, demonstrates the complexity of evaluating such evidence in a fair and just manner. The decision to quash D4 and D7’s convictions, despite the judge’s identification, highlights the court’s commitment to ensuring that the evidence is not merely circumstantial but also corroborated by independent witnesses.
