### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case involves **W**, a post-operative male-to-female transsexual, who seeks to marry her male partner in Hong Kong. Despite undergoing extensive medical treatment, including surgery and hormone therapy, the **Registrar of Marriages** denied her the right to marry, citing that the **Marriage Ordinance** and **Matrimonial Causes Ordinance** define marriage as between a man and a woman, and that W, being biologically male, does not qualify as a woman under these statutes. W challenged this decision, arguing that she should be recognized as a woman for the purposes of marriage under the law. The case reached the **Court of Final Appeal** in Hong Kong, where the issue was whether the legal definition of "woman" in the marriage laws should include transsexual individuals who have undergone sex reassignment surgery.

The case is notable for its legal and social significance, as it addresses the intersection of **transgender rights**, **constitutional law**, and **marriage rights** in Hong Kong. W's case is not about same-sex marriage but about the legal recognition of transsexual individuals as women for the purpose of marriage with someone of the opposite sex.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties

**Appellant (W):**  
W argued that she should be recognized as a woman for the purposes of marriage under the law. She contended that the legal definition of "woman" should not be limited to biological sex at birth but should also consider **psychological**, **social**, and **medical** factors, particularly after sex reassignment surgery. She emphasized that the **Basic Law** and the **Bill of Rights** guarantee the right to marry and that the current legal framework violates these rights by excluding transsexual individuals from marriage. She also argued that the **Corbett** decision in the UK, which limited the definition of "woman" to biological sex, was outdated and inconsistent with modern medical and social understanding of transsexualism.

**Respondent (Registrar of Marriages):**  
The Registrar argued that the legal definition of "woman" should remain tied to **biological sex** as determined at birth, as this is consistent with the **Basic Law** and the **Bill of Rights**. He contended that the **Corbett** approach, which was adopted in Hong Kong through the **Matrimonial Causes Ordinance**, was the correct legal standard and that changing it would require legislative action, not judicial interpretation. He also argued that the **Basic Law** and the **Bill of Rights** do not require the law to recognize transsexual individuals as women for marriage purposes, and that such recognition would be a matter for the legislature, not the courts.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) of the Case

The **ratio decidendi** of this case is that the **Hong Kong courts must interpret the Marriage Ordinance and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance in a way that is consistent with the constitutional rights to marriage and privacy**, and that the **biological definition of "woman" is not the only or the correct standard** for determining who qualifies as a woman for the purposes of marriage. The court held that the **Corbett** approach, which limited the definition of "woman
