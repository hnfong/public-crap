Okay, let's tackle this query about the NG KA LING AND ANOTHER v. THE DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION case. The user has provided a detailed judgment from the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal and wants four specific tasks completed. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to summarize the facts briefly. The case involves three appeals: Ng Ka Ling and her sister, Tsui Kuen Nang, and Cheung Lai Wah. All are Chinese nationals born on the mainland but have fathers who were Hong Kong permanent residents. They claimed the right of abode under Article 24(2)(3) of the Basic Law, which covers persons of Chinese nationality born outside Hong Kong to permanent residents. The Director of Immigration denied their right of abode, requiring them to obtain a one-way permit from the mainland authorities with a certificate of entitlement. The applicants challenged this under the Basic Law, arguing that their right of abode should be automatic once they're recognized as permanent residents.

Next, the arguments of the two parties. The applicants (Ng, Tsui, Cheung) argued that Article 24(3) grants them the right of abode without needing a one-way permit, and that the No 3 Ordinance's requirement is unconstitutional. The Director (respondent) contended that Article 22(4) of the Basic Law requires mainland residents to get approval for entry, so the one-way permit is necessary. The Director also argued that the birth out of wedlock issue in Cheung's case should disqualify her, but the applicants countered that the Basic Law and ICCPR don't discriminate based on legitimacy.

Now, the legal principles (ratio decidendi). This is the meaty part. The court had to address several issues: jurisdiction to interpret the Basic Law, constitutionality of the No 3 Ordinance, retrospectivity, the birth out of wedlock issue, and the Provisional Legislative Council's validity. 

Starting with jurisdiction, the court clarified that under Article 158, the Court of Final Appeal doesn't need to refer to the Standing Committee unless interpreting excluded provisions (those concerning central government affairs or Sino-HK relations). Here, the main issue was Article 24, which is within Hong Kong's autonomy, so no reference was needed. The court emphasized that the test is whether the predominant provision being interpreted is excluded or not. This is a key point because it defines the scope of Hong Kong's judicial autonomy.

Then, the constitutionality of the No 3 Ordinance. The court held that Article 22(4) doesn't override Article 24(3)'s right of abode. The Director argued that Article 22(4) requires mainland residents to get approval, but the court said permanent residents aren't "people from other parts of China" under that article—they're residents of Hong Kong. So the one-way permit requirement was unconstitutional. However, the verification process (certificate of entitlement) was okay as long as it didn't require the one-way permit. The court severed the unconstitutional parts, leaving the scheme intact except for the one-way permit requirement.

The retrospectivity issue: the No 3 Ordinance was deemed to apply from July 1, 1997, but the court found this unconstitutional because it would strip the applicants of their existing right of abode. They excised the retrospective provision, so the scheme only applies prospectively.

For the birth out of wedlock issue, the court ruled that the Basic Law's third category includes children born out of wedlock, so the provision in the Immigration Ordinance that excludes such children (except when legitimated) was unconstitutional. The court relied on the ICCPR's equality principles and the plain language of Article 24(2)(3).

The Provisional Legislative Council issue was resolved by holding that the PLC was legally constituted under the 1990 Decision, so its legislation (including the No 3 Ordinance) was valid.

Now, the striking or unusual aspects. The case is notable for its detailed constitutional interpretation under "one country, two systems," especially the court's assertion of judicial autonomy in interpreting the Basic Law without referring to the Standing Committee. The severance of parts of the ordinance rather than striking it down entirely is a nuanced approach. Also, the focus on the ICCPR's role in interpreting the Basic Law, particularly Article 15(1) regarding retrospective laws, is significant. The case involved infants (the Ng sisters were born in 1987 and 1989) claiming rights based on their fathers' residency, which is a human-interest angle. The court's emphasis on equality for illegitimate children under the ICCPR is another point. The fact that the applicants were detained upon arrival in Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, the handover day, adds historical weight.

Wait, let me check if I missed anything. The court also addressed the Joint Declaration and the Vienna Convention, but the main points seem covered. The applicants' status as permanent residents was accepted by the Director except for the birth issue, which the court overturned. The court's reasoning on the right of abode being a core right and not subject to mainland approval is crucial. Also, the distinction between permanent residents and other mainland residents under Article 22(4) is a key legal point.

I should make sure the summary of legal principles is thorough. The court's test for when a reference to the Standing Committee is needed (predominant provision being interpreted) is novel. The application of the ICCPR's equality principle to the Basic Law's interpretation is another point. The severance of the ordinance's unconstitutional parts without invalidating the whole scheme is a practical approach. The court's rejection of the Director's argument that Mainland laws can override Basic Law rights under Article 18 is important for constitutional law.

For the striking aspects, the timing on July 1, 1997, the handover day, is significant. The applicants were infants, which is unusual in such cases. The court's detailed analysis of the birth out of wedlock issue, especially the gender distinction in the Immigration Ordinance (mother vs. father), highlights a social justice angle. The court's use of the ICCPR to interpret domestic law under Article 39 is a notable application of international human rights law in a constitutional context.

Wait, the user asked for the ratio decidendi to be detailed and thorough. So I need to make sure each legal principle is explained clearly, especially the novel or controversial points. The jurisdictional issue with Article 158 is a big one because it's about the balance of power between Hong Kong's courts and the Standing Committee. The court's stance that they don't need to refer to the Standing Committee for provisions within Hong Kong's autonomy is a strong assertion of judicial independence. That's probably the most controversial part.

Also, the court's interpretation that permanent residents aren't "people from other parts of China" under Article 22(4) is a key legal point. The Director argued that they are, but the court said no because they're already permanent residents. That's a clever reading of the language. The court's reasoning that the right of abode is a core right that can't be qualified by mainland entry requirements is central to their decision.

For the birth out of wedlock, the court's emphasis on the plain language of Article 24(2)(3) and the ICCPR's equality principle over the JLG agreement is important. The JLG agreement was cited by the Director, but the court dismissed it as not overriding the constitutional text. That's a good example of judicial supremacy over administrative agreements.

I should also mention the severance of the ordinance. The court didn't strike down the entire No 3 Ordinance but only the parts requiring the one-way permit and the retrospective provision. This shows a careful approach to constitutional interpretation, preserving as much of the legislation as possible while removing the unconstitutional elements.

Wait, the user asked for the legal principles to be summarized in detail. So I need to structure that part with multiple paragraphs, focusing on the novel or controversial points. The jurisdictional test under Article 158 is definitely novel. The court's test for when a reference is needed (predominant provision) is a new framework. Also, the application of Article 15(1) of the ICCPR to invalidate a retrospective law is a significant point, as the lower courts had a different view.

Another point is the court's rejection of the argument that Mainland laws can limit Basic Law rights. The court stressed that Article 18(2) and (3) prevent Mainland laws from being applied in Hong Kong except for specific cases, so the exit permit requirement can't override the right of abode. That's a strong statement about the supremacy of the Basic Law.

For the striking aspects, the fact that the applicants were detained on the very day of the handover (July 1, 1997) is remarkable. The court's decision allowed them to stay in Hong Kong without the one-way permit, which was a direct response to the Director's actions. The human element of infants being denied rights based on their parents' status is poignant. Also, the court's detailed analysis of the gender discrimination in the Immigration Ordinance (treating fathers differently from mothers for illegitimate children) ties into broader social issues.

Wait, the user mentioned "anything striking, unusual or remarkable about the case." So beyond the legal points, the historical context of the handover, the involvement of the Provisional Legislative Council (which was a controversial body), and the fact that the case was one of the first major constitutional interpretations under the Basic Law are all notable. The court's assertion of judicial independence in the face of potential central government authority is a big deal for Hong Kong's legal system.

Let me check if I covered all the tasks. The user wants a brief summary of facts, then the arguments, then the legal principles in detail, and finally the striking aspects. I need to make sure each part is concise but covers the essentials. For the legal principles, I should avoid getting too bogged down in the procedural details and focus on the ratio decidendi, especially the novel aspects.

Wait, the court also addressed the Provisional Legislative Council's validity, but the user's main focus is probably on the other issues. The court held that the PLC was valid under the 1990 Decision, so the No 3 Ordinance was constitutional in that aspect. But the main legal principles are the ones related to the right of abode and the Basic Law interpretation.

I think I have all the key points. Now, I need to structure the answer according to the four tasks. Let me make sure each section is clear and meets the user's requirements. The user specified "no word limit" for the legal principles, so I can be thorough there. But the summary of facts and arguments should be brief.

Wait, the user provided the full judgment, so I need to extract the relevant parts. The applicants are the Ng sisters, Tsui, and Cheung. The Director's position is that they need the one-way permit. The court's main holdings are that the one-way permit requirement is unconstitutional, the birth out of wedlock provision is unconstitutional, the retrospective provision is unconstitutional, and the jurisdictional issue is resolved without a reference to the Standing Committee.

For the legal principles, the key points are:

1. Jurisdiction under Article 158: The Court of Final Appeal doesn't need to refer to the Standing Committee if the predominant provision being interpreted is within Hong Kong's autonomy (Article 24, not Article 22(4)).

2. Right of abode under Article 24(3) is not qualified by Article 22(4), so the one-way permit requirement is unconstitutional.

3. The verification scheme (certificate of entitlement) is constitutional, but the one-way permit part is not.

4. The retrospective provision is unconstitutional under ICCPR Article 15(1).

5. The birth out of wedlock provision violates equality principles under ICCPR and Basic Law.

6. The Provisional Legislative Council was validly constituted.

The striking aspects: handover day detention, infants involved, gender discrimination in immigration law, and the court's strong assertion of judicial autonomy.

I need to present all this clearly. Let me check if there's anything I missed. The court also discussed the Joint Declaration and the Vienna Convention, but the main points are covered. The severance of the ordinance is important, so I should mention that the court excised specific sections rather than invalidating the whole ordinance.

Okay, time to put it all together. Make sure each task is addressed in order, with the legal principles being the most detailed part. Avoid jargon where possible, but since it's a legal case, some terms are necessary. Highlight the novel aspects like the jurisdictional test and the application of ICCPR to invalidate the retrospective law.

### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts  
The case involves three appeals concerning the right of abode in Hong Kong under the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). The applicants—Ng Ka Ling, Ng Tan Tan (sisters), Tsui Kuen Nang, and Cheung Lai Wah—are Chinese nationals born on the mainland to fathers who were Hong Kong permanent residents (meeting the criteria of Article 24(2)(2) of the Basic Law). They arrived in Hong Kong on or before 1 July 1997 (the handover day) and claimed the right of abode under Article 24(2)(3), which grants permanent resident status to persons of Chinese nationality born outside Hong Kong to permanent residents. The Director of Immigration (Director) denied their right of abode, requiring them to obtain a "one way permit" from mainland authorities affixed with a "certificate of entitlement" under the Immigration (Amendment) (No 3) Ordinance 1997 (No 3 Ordinance). The applicants challenged this requirement as unconstitutional, arguing their right of abode under Article 24(3) should be automatic. Cheung Lai Wah’s claim was further contested on the grounds that she was born out of wedlock, which the Director argued disqualified her under the Immigration Ordinance’s definition of parent-child relationships.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties  
**Applicants’ Arguments:**  
- The right of abode under Article 24(3) is absolute and unqualified by Article 22(4) (which governs entry from mainland China). Permanent residents are not "people from other parts of China" under Article 22(4), as they are already residents of Hong Kong.  
- The No 3 Ordinance’s requirement for a "one way permit" to establish permanent resident status is unconstitutional, as it strips the constitutional right of abode.  
- The retrospective application of the No 3 Ordinance (deemed effective from 1 July 1997) violates Article 15(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), as it would retroactively criminalize their lawful presence in Hong Kong.  
- The Immigration Ordinance’s provision excluding children born out of wedlock from father-child relationships (para 1(2)(b)) is unconstitutional, violating equality principles under the ICCPR and the Basic Law.  

**Director’s Arguments:**  
- Article 22(4) qualifies the right of abode in Article 24(3), requiring mainland residents (including those claiming permanent resident status) to obtain mainland approval (via a "one way permit") for entry.  
- The No 3 Ordinance’s scheme (requiring a certificate of entitlement affixed to a one way permit) is constitutional, as it implements Article 22(4) and aligns with the Joint Declaration’s "present practice" of regulating entry.  
- The birth out of wedlock issue disqualifies Cheung Lai Wah, as the Immigration Ordinance treats fathers differently from mothers for illegitimate children.  
- The Provisional Legislative Council (PLC), which enacted the No 3 Ordinance, was legally constituted under the 1990 Decision of the National People’s Congress, rendering the Ordinance valid.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)  
The Court of Final Appeal (CFA) delivered a landmark judgment addressing multiple constitutional issues under the Basic Law, with its reasoning centered on **judicial autonomy**, **interpretation of constitutional rights**, and **severability of unconstitutional provisions**. The key legal principles are detailed below.  

#### **(a) Jurisdiction to Interpret the Basic Law and the Role of Article 158**  
The CFA resolved a pivotal jurisdictional question: whether Hong Kong courts must refer to the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (SCNPC) for interpretation of the Basic Law under Article 158. The Director argued that Article 22(4) (which concerns "affairs of the Central People’s Government" and "the relationship between the Central Authorities and the Region") is an "excluded provision," requiring a reference. The CFA rejected this, establishing a **novel test** for determining when a reference is necessary:  
- **The "predominant provision" test**: A reference to the SCNPC is required *only* if the *predominant provision* being interpreted is an "excluded provision" (i.e., concerning central government affairs or Sino-HK relations). If the predominant provision is within Hong Kong’s autonomy (e.g., Article 24, which defines permanent residents and their rights), no reference is needed, even if an excluded provision (e.g., Article 22(4)) is *arguably relevant*.  
- **Rationale**: The CFA emphasized that Article 158’s purpose is to vest interpretation of *excluded provisions* in the SCNPC while authorizing Hong Kong courts to interpret *non-excluded provisions* (e.g., Article 24) "on their own." Forcing a reference for every incidental reference to an excluded provision would "substantially derogate from the Region’s autonomy," undermining the "one country, two systems" principle.  
- **Novelty/Controversy**: This test overturned the Court of Appeal’s earlier view (in *HKSAR v Ma Wai Kwan David*) that Hong Kong courts lacked jurisdiction to question the validity of SCNPC acts. The CFA affirmed that Hong Kong courts have *exclusive jurisdiction* to interpret the Basic Law, including its consistency with SCNPC acts, without needing a reference. This is a **bold assertion of judicial independence** in the HKSAR’s constitutional framework.  

#### **(b) The Right of Abode Under Article 24(3) Is Not Qualified by Article 22(4)**  
The CFA held that **Article 22(4) does not override Article 24(3)**, rejecting the Director’s argument that mainland approval (via a "one way permit") is required for permanent residents to exercise their right of abode. Key reasoning:  
- **Language and Purpose**: Permanent residents are *not* "people from other parts of China" under Article 22(4), as they are already residents of Hong Kong. The phrase "people from other parts of China" refers to *non-residents* (e.g., mainland citizens without right of abode). The Director’s interpretation would render the right of abode "precarious" and discriminatory (e.g., permanent residents in mainland China would face different treatment than those abroad).  
- **Constitutional Balance**: The Basic Law establishes Hong Kong’s autonomy under "one country, two systems." Article 22(4) governs *non-residents* seeking entry, not *permanent residents* who already have a constitutional right to enter. The CFA stressed that "the Region exercising a high degree of autonomy... is obliged to admit people who under its constitution are its permanent residents."  
- **Rejection of Joint Declaration Reliance**: The Director cited the Joint Declaration’s statement that "entry into the Region from other parts of China will continue to be regulated in accordance with the present practice." The CFA dismissed this, noting the Joint Declaration did not intend to qualify the *right of abode* for permanent residents.  
- **Novelty/Controversy**: This interpretation **redefines the scope of "people from other parts of China"** in Article 22(4), clarifying that permanent residents are excluded from its application. It also **rejects the notion that mainland immigration laws can override constitutional rights** under the Basic Law, reinforcing the supremacy of the Basic Law over mainland legislation (per Article 18).  

#### **(c) Severability of the No 3 Ordinance**  
The CFA held that the No 3 Ordinance is **partially unconstitutional** but **not wholly invalid**. The unconstitutional elements were:  
- The requirement for a "one way permit" (Section 2AA(1)(a)), which the CFA deemed incompatible with the right of abode under Article 24(3).  
- The retrospective provision (Section 1(2)), which applied the Ordinance to pre-1 July 1997 arrivals.  
- The birth out of wedlock provision (para 1(2)(b)), which discriminated against illegitimate children.  
The CFA **severed** these parts while preserving the constitutional elements:  
- The verification scheme (requiring a certificate of entitlement) remains valid, as it merely confirms a claim to permanent resident status, not a qualification of the right of abode.  
- The CFA emphasized that the Director must operate the scheme fairly, with safeguards (e.g., statutory appeals to the Immigration Tribunal).  
- **Novelty/Controversy**: The Court’s **severance approach**—excising only the unconstitutional parts while preserving the rest—demonstrates a nuanced application of constitutional review, avoiding wholesale invalidation of legislation. This contrasts with rigid "all or nothing" judicial review.  

#### **(d) The Birth Out of Wedlock Issue and Equality Principles**  
The CFA ruled that **para 1(2)(b) of the Immigration Ordinance is unconstitutional** because it discriminates against children born out of wedlock from their fathers. Key points:  
- **Plain Language**: Article 24(2)(3) defines permanent residents as "persons of Chinese nationality born outside Hong Kong of those residents listed in categories (1) and (2)." The phrase "born of" includes children born *in or out of wedlock*.  
- **ICCPR and Equality**: The CFA relied on Article 39 of the Basic Law (incorporating the ICCPR) and the principle of equality (Article 25 of the Basic Law). The ICCPR’s Articles 3 and 26 prohibit discrimination, and the Court noted Hong Kong’s domestic law increasingly treats illegitimate children equally.  
- **Rejection of JLG Agreement**: The Director cited a Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (JLG) agreement as a "subsequent agreement" under the Vienna Convention. The CFA dismissed this, stating the agreement was likely pragmatic (not interpretive) and did not override the Basic Law’s plain language.  
- **Novelty/Controversy**: This is a **landmark application of international human rights law** (ICCPR) to interpret domestic constitutional provisions. The Court explicitly rejected gender-based discrimination in immigration law, aligning with evolving social norms.  

#### **(e) Retrospectivity and the ICCPR**  
The CFA held that the retrospective provision (Section 1(2)) is unconstitutional under **Article 15(1) of the ICCPR**, which prohibits retroactive criminal liability. The Director argued that the provision merely defined the right of abode, not criminalized conduct. The CFA countered that:  
- Without the certificate of entitlement, applicants were deemed to lack the right of abode, making their presence in Hong Kong a criminal offence under Section 38 of the Immigration Ordinance.  
- Article 15(1) of the ICCPR (incorporated via Article 39) invalidates *any* retrospective law that would render lawful conduct criminal.  
- **Novelty/Controversy**: The CFA **extended the ICCPR’s retroactivity principle** to invalidate a statutory provision, not just criminal proceedings. This aligns with international human rights jurisprudence (citing *Van Dijk and Van Hoof*), marking a significant step in integrating ICCPR into Hong Kong’s constitutional framework.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case  
1. **Historical Timing**: The case centered on **July 1, 1997**, the exact day of the Hong Kong handover. The applicants arrived on this day, and the Director detained them *immediately* upon arrival, highlighting the high stakes of the constitutional transition.  
2. **Infants as Litigants**: The Ng sisters (born in 1987 and 1989) were **infants** at the time of the appeal, raising poignant questions about the rights of children born to migrant parents. Their claim hinged on their fathers’ residency, underscoring the human impact of constitutional law.  
3. **Gender Discrimination in Immigration Law**: The case exposed a **systemic gender bias** in the Immigration Ordinance, which treated fathers of illegitimate children differently from mothers. The CFA’s rejection of this bias—citing ICCPR equality principles—was a rare judicial intervention into social policy.  
4. **Judicial Assertiveness**: The CFA’s **unwavering assertion of judicial autonomy** under Article 158 was unprecedented. By refusing to refer to the SCNPC and affirming Hong Kong courts’ authority to interpret the Basic Law *without* central government oversight, the judgment redefined the HKSAR’s constitutional relationship with Beijing.  
5. **Integration of International Law**: The Court’s **explicit reliance on the ICCPR** to invalidate domestic legislation (e.g., the birth out of wedlock provision and the retrospective clause) demonstrated a sophisticated fusion of international human rights law and local constitutional interpretation.  
6. **Provisional Legislative Council’s Legitimacy**: The CFA’s **validation of the PLC** (a controversial body established by the Preparatory Committee) as a legally constituted legislature under the 1990 Decision was pivotal. This resolved a foundational question about the HKSAR’s post-handover governance.  
7. **Humanitarian Outcome**: The judgment allowed the applicants to **retain their right of abode without needing a one way permit**, effectively overturning the Director’s detention of infants and young adults on the day of the handover. This was a rare victory for marginalized groups in constitutional litigation.  

In summary, *Ng Ka Ling v. Director of Immigration* is a **seminal case** that redefined Hong Kong’s constitutional jurisprudence, balancing judicial independence with the "one country, two systems" framework. Its principles on jurisdiction, equality, and the supremacy of the Basic Law continue to shape Hong Kong’s legal landscape. [end of text]
