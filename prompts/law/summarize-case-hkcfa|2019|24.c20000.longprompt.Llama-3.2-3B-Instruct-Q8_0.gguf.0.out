**Facts of the Case**

The case involves the prosecution of Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, the former Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, for two counts of misconduct in public office. The first count alleges that Tsang accepted a bribe in the form of a promise to renovate a residential property in Shenzhen in exchange for favorable treatment in the granting of broadcasting licenses to Wave Media Limited (WML), a company in which the owner of the property, Wong Cho-bau, held shares. The second count alleges that Tsang failed to disclose his dealings with Wong and the property to the Executive Council, which was considering the broadcasting license applications.

The case began with media reports in February 2012 alleging improper associations between Tsang and prominent businesspeople. Tsang responded to these allegations in media interviews, and an investigation was launched. In September 2013, the prosecution produced a lease agreement for the property, which they claimed was a sham and part of an attempt to conceal the corrupt dealings. Tsang was tried and convicted on the second count of misconduct in public office, and sentenced to 20 months' imprisonment. He appealed to the Court of Appeal, which dismissed his appeal against conviction but reduced his sentence to 12 months.

**Arguments of the Parties**

The prosecution argued that Tsang's actions constituted a clear case of bribery and misconduct in public office. They claimed that Tsang accepted a bribe in exchange for favorable treatment of WML's broadcasting license applications and failed to disclose his dealings with Wong and the property to the Executive Council. The prosecution also argued that Tsang's actions were deliberate and wilful, and that he knew that his conduct was unlawful.

The defense argued that Tsang's actions were not corrupt and that he had acted in good faith. They claimed that the renovations to the property were arm's-length and commercial, and that Tsang had no interest in the broadcasting applications. The defense also argued that Tsang had not wilfully failed to disclose his dealings with Wong and the property, and that his actions were not serious enough to warrant criminal liability.

**Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

The case turns on the interpretation of the common law offense of misconduct in public office. The prosecution argued that Tsang's actions constituted a clear case of bribery and misconduct in public office, and that he had acted deliberately and wilfully. The defense argued that Tsang's actions were not corrupt and that he had acted in good faith.

The key issue in this case is the interpretation of the element of "wilfulness" in the offense of misconduct in public office. The prosecution argued that Tsang's actions were deliberate and wilful, while the defense argued that his actions were not wilful and that he had acted in good faith.

The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge's directions on the element of wilfulness were inadequate. The Court found that the prosecution's primary case on Count 2, which alleged that Tsang deliberately concealed the true nature of his relationship with Wong and the property, was not clearly explained to the jury. The Court also found that the trial judge's directions on the element of seriousness were inadequate, as they did not provide sufficient guidance on how the jury should assess the seriousness of Tsang's actions.

The Court of Appeal also found that the prosecution's alternative case on Count 2, which alleged that Tsang's actions were a serious abuse of office, was not clearly explained to the jury. The Court held that the prosecution's approach to Count 2 was too close to the primary case, and that the jury was not given sufficient guidance on how to approach the alternative case.

The Court of Appeal ultimately quashed Tsang's conviction and sentence, holding that the trial judge's directions on the elements of the offense were inadequate and that the prosecution's alternative case was not clearly explained to the jury. The Court also found that Tsang had already served his sentence and that a new trial was not necessary.

The decision in this case is significant because it highlights the importance of clear and adequate directions on the elements of a criminal offense. The Court of Appeal's decision also underscores the need for prosecutors to clearly explain their alternative cases to the jury, and for judges to provide sufficient guidance on how the jury should approach those cases.
