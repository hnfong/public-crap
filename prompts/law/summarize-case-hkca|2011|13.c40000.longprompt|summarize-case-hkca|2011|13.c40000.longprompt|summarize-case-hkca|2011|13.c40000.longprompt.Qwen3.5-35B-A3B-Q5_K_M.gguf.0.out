### 1. Summary of Facts

This case concerns a probate dispute regarding the estate of the late Nina Wang, the chairwoman of the Chinachem Group, who died in April 2007. Nina Wang had executed a valid will in 2002 ("the 2002 will"), leaving her entire estate to the Chinachem Charitable Foundation, a charity she co-founded with her late husband. The will included a unique provision for the supervision of the foundation by the UN Secretary-General, the Premier of China, and the Chief Executive of Hong Kong.

Following Nina Wang's death, the first defendant, Chan Chun Chuen, produced a second will dated 16 October 2006 ("the 2006 will"), which bequeathed the entire estate to him. Chan claimed he and Nina Wang had been in a long-term romantic relationship and that she intended to leave him her fortune. The second defendant, Nina Wang's sister, supported the validity of the 2002 will.

The trial judge found that the 2006 will was a forgery. Key factual findings included:
*   **The Witnesses:** The two witnesses to the 2006 will (a solicitor, Mr. Winfield Wong, and a long-term employee, Mr. Ng Shung Mo) testified that they witnessed a *different* document on that date—a partial will leaving a small sum to a Mr. Chan, not the 2006 will.
*   **Physical Evidence:** Scientific analysis revealed the signature of Nina Wang on the 2006 will was written over a crease in the paper, whereas the witnesses stated the paper was folded but not creased at the time of signing. Furthermore, a draft version of the will found with the 2006 will showed signature impressions in exact register, suggesting the 2006 will was a copy made from a forged original or a single sheet was used to forge multiple signatures.
*   **Nina Wang's Capacity:** Evidence showed Nina Wang was physically too weak in mid-October 2006 to have prepared or signed the will herself.
*   **The Relationship:** The judge found Chan to be untrustworthy and a liar. While acknowledging a clandestine relationship, the judge noted Chan was married with children and that Nina Wang had continued to support her charity and family despite giving Chan substantial sums of money (totaling over $700 million) for "Feng Shui" services and investments.
*   **The Motive:** The judge concluded Chan forged the will to secure Nina Wang's immense fortune (estimated at $100 billion) after she had stopped seeing him during her 2002 forgery trial but resumed contact after her cancer diagnosis.

The Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge's findings, dismissing Chan's appeal and confirming the 2006 will was a forgery.

### 2. Summary of Arguments

**The First Defendant (Chan Chun Chuen):**
*   **Procedural Error:** Chan argued the trial judge failed to properly evaluate the evidence against "inherent probabilities and improbabilities" as required by precedent (specifically *Nina Kung v Wang Din Shin*).
*   **Witness Reliability:** He contended that the attesting witnesses (Mr. Wong and Mr. Ng) were unreliable and had tailored their evidence to support the Plaintiff. He argued that the discrepancies in their statements (e.g., regarding the nature of the document witnessed) were minor and that the document they witnessed was indeed the 2006 will.
*   **Handwriting Evidence:** Chan challenged the expert evidence, arguing that the Plaintiff's expert (Mr. Radley) used inappropriate comparison signatures (excluding hospital records) and applied a flawed "no-lose" statistical argument. He claimed the accumulation of "rare" features in the questioned signature actually suggested genuineness, not forgery.
*   **Emotional Context:** He argued the judge was morally prejudiced against the romantic relationship between Nina Wang and himself, which influenced the finding of forgery.

**The Plaintiff (Chinachem Charitable Foundation):**
*   **Forgery Established:** The Plaintiff argued that the evidence overwhelmingly proved the 2006 will was a forgery, primarily based on the testimony of the attesting witnesses who confirmed they saw a different document.
*   **Inherent Improbabilities:** The Plaintiff highlighted the "six inherent improbabilities" of the 2006 will's existence, including Nina Wang's physical incapacity, the lack of any record of the will at Chinachem offices, and the suspicious timing of its appearance.
*   **Expert Evidence:** The Plaintiff defended the methodology of their handwriting expert, arguing that the exclusion of deteriorated hospital signatures was correct to ensure "comparing like with like," and that the statistical accumulation of rare features in the questioned signature was strong evidence of simulation.
*   **Costs:** Given the finding of forgery and perjury, the Plaintiff argued that costs should be awarded on an indemnity basis against the First Defendant.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**The Evaluation of Evidence and Inherent Probabilities**
The Court of Appeal reaffirmed the principle that in probate cases, particularly those involving allegations of forgery, the trial judge must evaluate evidence in light of "inherent probabilities and improbabilities." This principle, established in *Nina Kung v Wang Din Shin*, requires the court to consider whether the facts alleged are consistent with human nature and common sense. The Court held that the trial judge had meticulously applied this test, specifically analyzing six inherent improbabilities regarding the 2006 will. The appellate court emphasized that while the weight given to these probabilities is a matter for the trial judge, the appellate court will not interfere unless the judge failed to consider them or reached a conclusion that was plainly wrong. In this case, the Court found the judge's application of this principle to be thorough and correct.

**The Role of Attesting Witnesses and the "One Document" Rule**
A central legal principle applied here concerns the reliability of attesting witnesses and the physical integrity of the document. The Court upheld the trial judge's finding that the document witnessed by Mr. Wong and Mr. Ng on 16 October 2006 was not the 2006 will. The Court reasoned that the witnesses were credible and that their evidence regarding the content of the document they signed (a partial will) was consistent with the physical evidence (the crease in the paper). The Court noted that the scientific evidence showing the signature was written over a crease, while the witnesses stated the paper was folded but not creased, was a fatal inconsistency for the First Defendant's case. This reinforces the legal principle that where attesting witnesses testify to a different document than the one produced, and that testimony is corroborated by physical anomalies, the court is justified in concluding the produced document is a forgery.

**Handwriting Identification: The "No-Lose" Argument and Statistical Rarity**
The case provides a detailed exposition on the legal and scientific principles governing handwriting identification, specifically addressing the "no-lose" argument and the statistical significance of "rarities."
*   **The "No-Lose" Argument:** The Court addressed the argument that if a signature exhibits a wide range of variation (a large "target"), any match is inevitable and therefore neutral. The Court accepted the Plaintiff's expert's view that if the range of variation is so wide that a match is guaranteed, the similarity has no identification value. This is a crucial principle: a match within a vast range of natural variation does not prove authenticity if the variation is so broad that it encompasses almost any writing.
*   **Accumulation of Rarities:** The Court rejected the First Defendant's argument that the presence of "rare" features (features that occur infrequently in genuine signatures) could be used to argue for genuineness. Instead, the Court adopted the principle that an accumulation of rare features in a single questioned signature is highly improbable to occur by chance. Citing *Osborn* and *Huber & Headrick*, the Court held that the statistical likelihood of a forger successfully incorporating multiple rare features into a single signature is so low that such an accumulation constitutes strong evidence of forgery. The Court clarified that while a single rare feature might be coincidental, the convergence of many such features is statistically significant and indicative of simulation.
*   **Selection of Comparison Signatures:** The Court upheld the principle that comparison signatures must be "comparable" in terms of quality and control. The exclusion of deteriorated hospital signatures (which showed poor pen control) from the comparison set was deemed correct because the questioned signature was "well-controlled." Comparing a high-quality signature with low-quality, deteriorated samples would distort the range of variation and lead to erroneous conclusions.

**Costs in Cases of Forgery and Abuse of Process**
The Court established a strong principle regarding costs in cases involving forgery. Where a party knowingly puts forward a forged document and lies to the court to secure a substantial benefit, this constitutes an "egregious abuse of the process of the court." The Court held that in such circumstances, it is inconceivable that costs should not be awarded on an **indemnity basis** against the fraudulent party. The Court emphasized that the First Defendant's conduct was not merely a dispute over facts but a deliberate attempt to defraud the estate and the court. Consequently, the Court upheld the indemnity costs order, noting that any other order would be an affront to the administration of justice.

**Novelty and Controversy**
While the application of the "inherent probabilities" test is well-established, the detailed judicial analysis of the statistical principles in handwriting identification is notable. The Court's explicit endorsement of the "accumulation of rarities" as a valid statistical test for forgery, and its rejection of the "no-lose" argument when the range of variation is excessive, provides a robust framework for future expert evidence in handwriting cases. The Court's willingness to rely on statistical probability (odds of 1 in tens of trillions) to support a finding of forgery, even without a perfect mathematical formula, demonstrates a pragmatic approach to scientific evidence in the courtroom.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects

*   **The "Feng Shui" Will:** The most extraordinary aspect of the case is the context of the alleged will. Nina Wang, one of the wealthiest women in Asia, allegedly left her fortune to a man who was primarily her "Feng Shui master." The relationship was driven by her desperate hope that he could use his spiritual powers to locate her missing husband (Teddy Wang, who had been kidnapped in 1990 and was presumed dead) and later to cure her terminal cancer. The "will" was allegedly a result of her vulnerability to these spiritual practices during her final days.
*   **The Hole-Digging:** The case details bizarre activities where Nina Wang, under the direction of the First Defendant, ordered the digging of deep holes at various Chinachem properties. These were not construction projects but "Feng Shui" rituals intended to locate her husband or cure her illness. The correlation between her deteriorating health, the digging of holes, and the massive financial transfers to the First Defendant (totaling over $700 million) paints a picture of a woman in a state of delusion or extreme desperation.
*   **The "Clandestine" Lover:** The First Defendant was a married man with three children who maintained a secret, long-term affair with a billionaire. Despite receiving hundreds of millions of dollars, he never married her, and she never publicly acknowledged him. The judge described the relationship as "surreptitious and lacking in permanency," noting that he spent holidays with his family while Nina Wang was dying.
*   **The "Partial Will" Confusion:** The core of the legal battle hinged on a confusing moment where the witnesses claimed they signed a "partial will" (leaving a small sum to a Mr. Chan) while the First Defendant claimed they signed a full will leaving everything to him. The witnesses' insistence that they saw a partial will, combined with the physical evidence of the crease, created a "smoking gun" that the First Defendant's entire case collapsed.
*   **The Scale of the Fortune:** The sheer magnitude of the estate (estimated at $100 billion) and the fact that the dispute was over a document that was proven to be a forgery highlights the extreme lengths to which individuals will go to secure wealth. The First Defendant's attempt to forge a will to claim a fortune that was legally destined for a charitable foundation is a stark example of greed.
*   **The "No-Lose" Statistical Argument:** The detailed legal battle over the statistical probability of handwriting features (odds of 1 in tens of trillions) is remarkable for its complexity. It shows how modern litigation can delve into high-level statistics and probability theory to determine the authenticity of a signature, moving beyond simple visual comparison. [end of text]
