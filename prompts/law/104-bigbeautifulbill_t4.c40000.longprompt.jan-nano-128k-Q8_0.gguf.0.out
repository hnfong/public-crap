Okay, let's tackle this query. The user wants a summary of each section in the bill, starting with Sec. 40001. They specified that each section should be a paragraph of at most four sentences, with specific details on parties, entities, and quantities.

First, I need to go through each section one by one. The bill is divided into several titles and subtitles. The user provided the entire text, so I'll parse each section carefully. 

Starting with Sec. 40001: It's about Coast Guard mission readiness. The key points are the $24.5935 billion appropriation for 2025, which remains available until 2029. The funds are allocated for various assets like aircraft, cutters, shore infrastructure, and maintenance. The user wants specific entities and quantities, so I need to mention the exact amounts for each part, like the $1,142.5 million for fixed-wing aircraft, etc.

Next, Sec. 40002: Spectrum auctions. The main changes here are the amendment to the Communications Act, extending the auction authority until 2034. The Commission is required to auction at least 300 MHz, with a schedule for 200 MHz in the first two years. The President can modify frequencies for national security. The $50 million appropriation for the Office of Commercial Space Transportation.

Sec. 40003: Air traffic control improvements. The FAA gets $4.75 billion for telecommunications, $3 billion for radar systems, $500 million for runway safety tech, etc. The user needs to note each specific allocation and the entities involved, like the FAA Administrator.

Sec. 40004: Space launch and reentry user fees. The fee is imposed on launches/reentries, with specific amounts increasing annually. The fund is established with 70% of the fees available for the Office of Commercial Space Transportation. The user should mention the exact fee amounts per year and the fund's purpose.

Sec. 40005: Mars missions, Artemis, and Moon to Mars program. The Administration gets $9.995 billion for various projects, including the Mars telecom orbiter, Orion spacecraft, ISS operations, etc. Specific amounts for each part and the entities like NASA, the Airports Authority, etc.

Sec. 40006: Corporate average fuel economy civil penalties. The penalties are set to $0.00 instead of $5 and $10, which affects manufacturers. The user needs to note the change in penalty amounts and the applicability to all model years.

Sec. 40007: Payments for lease of Metropolitan Washington airports. The annual payments are adjusted from $3 million in 1987 to $15 million in 2027, with renegotiation every 10 years. The entities here are the Airports Authority and the Treasury.

Sec. 40008: Rescission of NOAA funds. The user needs to know that unobligated balances from sections 40001, 40002, 40003, 40004 of the previous law are rescinded. The entities involved are the NOAA and the Treasury.

Sec. 40009: Reduction in transfers to the Travel Promotion Fund. The amount is reduced from $100 million to $20 million annually. The Travel Promotion Fund is the entity here.

Sec. 40010: Rescission of unobligated funds for alternative fuel and aviation tech. The funds from section 40007(a) of the previous law are rescinded. The entity is the Treasury.

Sec. 40011: Rescission of Public Wireless Supply Chain Innovation Fund. $850 million from the CHIPS Act is rescinded. The entity is the Treasury, and the specific amount is $850 million.

I need to make sure each summary is concise, specific, and includes all the key numbers and entities. Also, check that each section is covered in one paragraph, no more than four sentences. Avoid vague terms and stick to the exact figures and organizations mentioned. Let me verify each section's details again to ensure accuracy.
