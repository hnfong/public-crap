## NG KA LING AND ANOTHER v. THE DIRECTOR OF IMMIGRATION: A Summary

### 1. Facts of the Case

This case concerned the right of abode in Hong Kong for Chinese nationals born on the Mainland to at least one parent who was a Hong Kong permanent resident. Following the handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, a number of Mainland-born individuals with Hong Kong permanent resident parents sought to establish their own right of abode. The Director of Immigration initially denied their claims, requiring them to apply for and obtain a “one-way permit” from the Mainland authorities and a certificate of entitlement before recognizing their permanent resident status.  The applicants (Ng Ka Ling, Ng Tan Tan, and Tsui Kuen Nang) entered Hong Kong before a new immigration ordinance (No. 3 Ordinance) came into effect, but the Director applied the new rules retroactively. Miss Cheung Lai Wah’s case also involved the issue of being born out of wedlock. The core issue was whether the Immigration Ordinance, particularly the requirement of a one-way permit, was consistent with the Basic Law’s provisions guaranteeing the right of abode to permanent residents.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**The Applicants (Ng Ka Ling, Ng Tan Tan, Tsui Kuen Nang, and Cheung Lai Wah):**

*   They were permanent residents under Article 24(2)(3) of the Basic Law (born outside Hong Kong to a Hong Kong permanent resident parent).
*   As permanent residents, they had an inherent right of abode under Article 24(3), meaning the right to land and remain in Hong Kong without restriction.
*   The Immigration Ordinance’s requirement of a one-way permit and certificate of entitlement was unconstitutional as it imposed an unnecessary condition on their right of abode, effectively subjecting their constitutional right to the discretion of Mainland authorities.
*   The retrospective application of the No. 3 Ordinance was unlawful, as it deprived them of a right they already possessed.
*   Miss Cheung argued that the provision in the Immigration Ordinance discriminating against children born out of wedlock was unconstitutional.

**The Director of Immigration:**

*   Article 22(4) of the Basic Law, which allows the Central People’s Government to control entry into Hong Kong, justified the requirement of a one-way permit for Mainland residents seeking to settle in Hong Kong.
*   The No. 3 Ordinance was a legitimate exercise of legislative power to verify the status of permanent residents and manage immigration.
*   The retrospective application of the No. 3 Ordinance was valid as it was necessary to establish a consistent system for determining permanent residency.
*   The provision regarding children born out of wedlock was consistent with existing immigration practices and did not violate the Basic Law.



### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

This case established several crucial legal principles concerning the interpretation of the Basic Law and the rights of permanent residents in Hong Kong.

**1. Constitutional Jurisdiction of Hong Kong Courts:** The Court unequivocally affirmed that the courts of Hong Kong have the jurisdiction to examine whether legislation enacted by the legislature or acts of the executive authorities are consistent with the Basic Law. This is a fundamental aspect of the Region’s independent judicial power and its role as a constitutional check on other branches of government.  The courts also have the power to examine acts of the National People’s Congress for consistency with the Basic Law.

**2. Approach to Interpreting the Basic Law:** The Court adopted a purposive approach to interpretation, emphasizing the unique character of the Basic Law as an entrenched constitutional instrument implementing the “one country, two systems” principle. This involves considering the document’s purpose, language, context (including the Joint Declaration), and relevant extrinsic materials. A generous interpretation should be applied to provisions guaranteeing fundamental rights.

**3. The Relationship Between Article 22(4) and Article 24:** The Court held that Article 22(4), concerning entry requirements for people from other parts of China, *did not* qualify the right of abode established in Article 24.  The Court reasoned that “people from other parts of China” do not include those who are already permanent residents of Hong Kong. Applying Article 22(4) to permanent residents would subject their constitutional rights to the discretion of Mainland authorities, undermining the Region’s autonomy.

**4. The Validity of the No. 3 Ordinance:** The Court found parts of the No. 3 Ordinance unconstitutional. Specifically, the requirement for permanent residents to obtain a one-way permit before exercising their right of abode was deemed invalid. However, the Court severed the unconstitutional parts, upholding the scheme’s verification process for establishing permanent resident status through a certificate of entitlement, as long as it didn’t require the one-way permit.

**5. Retrospectivity:** The Court ruled that the retrospective application of the No. 3 Ordinance was unconstitutional. Applying the ordinance retroactively deprived individuals of a right they already possessed under the Basic Law.

**6. Discrimination Based on Birth Status:** The Court held that the provision in the Immigration Ordinance discriminating against children born out of wedlock was unconstitutional. It violated the principle of equality enshrined in the Basic Law and the ICCPR, as there was no legitimate justification for treating children differently based on their parents’ marital status.

**7. The Role of the Standing Committee:** The Court clarified the process for seeking interpretations from the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress under Article 158. A reference is required only when the courts are interpreting provisions concerning affairs within the Central People’s Government’s responsibility or the relationship between the Central Authorities and the Region, *and* such interpretation will affect the judgment in the case. The Court retains the sole authority to determine whether these conditions are met.

**8. The Provisional Legislative Council:** The Court affirmed the legality of the Provisional Legislative Council, finding that its formation was consistent with the Basic Law and the 1990 Decision. It was established as an interim measure to fill a legislative vacuum and prepare for the formation of the First Legislative Council.



### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case

Several aspects of this case are striking and remarkable:

*   **Constitutional Significance:** This case was the first major test of the Basic Law’s provisions following the handover. It established fundamental principles regarding the relationship between Hong Kong and Mainland China, the scope of the Region’s autonomy, and the protection of fundamental rights.
*   **Political Context:** The case arose in a highly sensitive political context, following the handover and amid ongoing concerns about the implementation of the “one country, two systems” principle. The decisions were closely watched by both the Hong Kong and Mainland governments.
*   **Large Number of Claimants:** The case involved a large number of Mainland-born individuals seeking to establish their right of abode, highlighting the practical implications of the Basic Law’s provisions.
*   **Novel Interpretation:** The Court’s interpretation of Article 22(4) was novel, as it rejected the Director’s argument that it qualified the right of abode. This interpretation was crucial in safeguarding the Region’s autonomy and protecting the rights of permanent residents.
*   **International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights:** The Court’s reliance on the ICCPR in striking down the discrimination against children born out of wedlock demonstrated the importance of international human rights standards in Hong Kong’s legal system.
*   **The Length and Complexity:** The judgment is exceptionally long and detailed, reflecting the complexity of the legal issues involved and the importance of the case. The multiple opinions and careful reasoning underscore the Court’s commitment to a thorough and principled analysis.
*   **The Quota System:** The case brought to light the practical difficulties and potential injustices of the Mainland’s quota system for one-way permits, which limited the number of people allowed to settle in Hong Kong.
*   **The Role of the Judiciary:** The case demonstrated the crucial role of the judiciary in upholding the Basic Law and protecting the rights of Hong Kong residents, even in the face of political pressure.
