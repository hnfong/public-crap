### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts

This case involves a dispute over whether an individual, Stephen Chan Chi Wan, and his agent, Tseng Pei Kun, committed an offence under the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO) by accepting and offering an advantage, respectively, in relation to the affairs or business of Chan’s employer, Television Broadcasts Ltd (TVB). Chan was employed by TVB as a General Manager (Broadcasting) and hosted a talk show called “Be My Guest” on a TVB pay channel. The show became popular, and Chan was invited by OC, the operator of a shopping mall, to appear on a live version of the show as part of a New Year’s Eve Countdown event. OC paid through Tseng’s company, Idea Empire Advertising & Production Company Limited (IEAP), to have Chan and another guest appear on the show, with Chan receiving $112,000 and Lai Yiu Cheung receiving $20,000. 

The prosecution charged Chan and Tseng with conspiring to accept an advantage in relation to TVB’s affairs or business, and with the substantive offences of accepting and offering an advantage, respectively. The trial judge initially acquitted them, but the Court of Appeal reversed the verdict, finding that Chan’s participation in the show was an act in relation to TVB’s business. The case was appealed to the Court of Final Appeal, where the judges ultimately ruled that the appellants were not guilty of an offence under section 9 of the POBO.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties

**Prosecution's Argument:**
The prosecution argued that Chan’s participation in the “Be My Guest” segment of the Countdown event was an act in relation to TVB’s affairs or business. They contended that the show was part of TVB’s programming, and that OC’s sponsorship of the event included the addition of the show, which was intended to boost audience ratings and promote the shopping mall. The prosecution maintained that the payment to Chan was an inducement for him to participate in the show, which was part of TVB’s business, and that this constituted an offence under section 9 of the POBO. They also argued that the Court of Appeal correctly interpreted the phrase “in relation to the principal’s affairs or business” as requiring that the act must be aimed at or intended to influence the principal’s business.

**Defendants' Argument:**
The defendants argued that Chan’s participation in the show was not an act in relation to TVB’s affairs or business. They contended that Chan was not acting in his capacity as a public servant or agent of TVB when he participated in the show, as he was not required to appear on camera and had no contractual obligation to do so. They also argued that the show was a personal endeavor, and that the payment from OC was not intended to influence or affect TVB’s business. The defendants further claimed that the trial judge was correct in finding that Chan had a reasonable excuse for accepting the payment, as he believed that TVB would not object to his participation and that the payment was not for an act in relation to TVB’s business.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) of the Case

The case centered on the interpretation of **section 9 of the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance (POBO)**, which criminalizes corrupt transactions involving agents in relation to the affairs or business of their principals. The Court of Final Appeal delivered a unanimous judgment, with three different rationales, but all concluding that the appellants were not guilty of an offence under section 9.

#### **A. The Nature and Scope of Section 9**

Section 9 of the POBO criminalizes:
- **Agents** who, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, **accept** an advantage as an inducement or reward for or otherwise on account of:
  - (a) doing or forbearing to do an act in relation to the principal’s affairs or business; or
  - (b) showing or forbearing to show favor or disfavor to any person in relation to the principal’s affairs or business.
- **Persons** who, without lawful authority or reasonable excuse, **offer** an advantage to an agent for the same purposes.

The key issue was whether the act of participating in the “Be My Guest” segment was an act **in relation to** TVB’s affairs or business. The Court emphasized that the phrase “in relation to” must be interpreted **restrictively**, requiring that the act must be **intended to influence or affect** the principal’s affairs or business.

#### **B. The Meaning of “In Relation to the Principal’s Affairs or Business”**

The Court held that the phrase “in relation to the principal’s affairs or business” does not merely mean that the act is connected to the principal’s business in a general sense. Rather, it requires that the act must be **intended to influence or affect** the principal’s affairs or business. This interpretation was derived from the **Privy Council’s decision in Commissioner of the ICAC v Ch’ng Poh**, where it was held that the act must be aimed at the principal and intended to influence or affect the principal’s affairs.

The Court rejected the **Court of Appeal’s broad interpretation**, which had held that any act involving the principal’s business, even if beneficial, could fall within the scope of section 9. The Court emphasized that the **mischief** of the legislation was to prevent corrupt transactions that undermine the integrity of the agency relationship, not to criminalize all acts that are connected to the principal’s business.

#### **C. The Role of Mens Rea and Intention**

The Court emphasized that **mens rea** is a necessary element of the offence. For an agent to be guilty of an offence under section 9, the agent must have **knowledge or belief** that the advantage was provided as an inducement or reward for an act in relation to the principal’s affairs or business. Similarly, for the offeror, the prosecution must prove that the offer was intended to induce the agent to act in a way that would influence or affect the principal’s affairs or business.

The Court also held that the **intention** of the offeror is crucial. The offer must be made with the **purpose** of inducing the agent to act in a way that would influence or affect the principal’s affairs or business. This was a key distinction from the **Court of Appeal’s reasoning**, which had focused on the **consequences** of the act rather than the **intent** behind it.

#### **D. The Role of Reasonable Excuse**

The Court held that the **defence of reasonable excuse** is available under section 9. The prosecution must prove that the agent did not have a reasonable excuse for accepting the advantage. In this case, the Court found that Chan had a **reasonable excuse** because he believed that TVB would not object to his participation in the show and that the payment was not for an act in relation to TVB’s business. The Court emphasized that the **reasonableness** of the excuse must be assessed on an **objective standard**, based on the facts of the case.

#### **E. The Role of the Principal’s Consent and Knowledge**

The Court held that the **principal’s consent and knowledge** are not required for the act to be in relation to the principal’s affairs or business. However, the **absence of consent** may be relevant in determining whether the act was **adverse** to the principal’s interests. The Court rejected the **Court of Appeal’s view** that the absence of prejudice to the principal’s interests was irrelevant, emphasizing that the **integrity of the agency relationship** is the key concern.

#### **F. The Role of the Principal’s Business and the Agent’s Role**

The Court emphasized that the **agent’s role** and the **nature of the act** are critical in determining whether the act is in relation to the principal’s business. The Court held that the agent’s **position** and the **nature of the act** must be considered in context. In this case, the Court found that Chan’s participation in the show was not an act in relation to TVB’s business, as it was a **personal endeavor** and not part of his official duties.

#### **G. The Role of the Principal’s Business and the Agent’s Conduct**

The Court held that the **agent’s conduct** must be **intended to influence or affect** the principal’s affairs or business. The Court rejected the **Court of Appeal’s view** that the **consequences** of the act, even if beneficial, could be sufficient to trigger the offence. The Court emphasized that the **intent** behind the act is what matters, not the **outcome**.

#### **H. The Role of the Principal’s Business and the Agent’s Conduct**

The Court held that the **agent’s conduct** must be **intended to influence or affect** the principal’s affairs or business. The Court rejected the **Court of Appeal’s view** that the **consequences** of the act, even if beneficial, could be sufficient to trigger the offence. The Court emphasized that the **intent** behind the act is what matters, not the **outcome**.

#### **I. The Role of the Principal’s Business and the Agent’s Conduct**

The Court held that the **agent’s conduct** must be **intended to influence or affect** the principal’s affairs or business. The Court rejected the **Court of Appeal’s view** that the **consequences** of the act, even if beneficial, could be sufficient to trigger the offence. The Court emphasized that the **intent** behind the act is what matters, not the **outcome**.
