Okay, I need to tackle this case summary. Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully. The case is about a probate dispute involving two wills. The main parties are the Chinachem Charitable Foundation (respondent) and the Applicant (Chan Chun Chuen). The key issue is whether the 2006 Will is valid or a forgery.

First, I'll summarize the facts. Mrs. Nina Wang died in 2007, leaving behind two wills: a 2002 Will that names the Foundation as beneficiary and a 2006 Will that the Applicant claims is entirely his. The trial court found the 2006 Will to be a forgery. The Applicant appealed, but the Court of Appeal upheld the decision. Now, he's seeking leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal.

Next, the arguments. The Foundation argues that the appeal doesn't meet the criteria for leave as of right because it's not a monetary claim but a property right. They also contend that the financial impact isn't immediate. The Applicant counters by saying the case involves an indirect claim to property and that the Court should grant leave as of right. He also argues for discretionary leave based on public importance and new evidence.

For the legal principles, the case deals with the interpretation of section 22(1)(a) of the Court's statute regarding appeals as of right. The Court emphasized that such appeals are rare and require a clear monetary claim or immediate financial impact. The decision also addresses the practice of reviewing concurrent findings of fact, stressing that the Court won't interfere unless there's a miscarriage of justice. The new evidence ground was examined, but it didn't justify overturning the findings.

Lastly, what's striking about the case? The extensive trial and appeal process, the high value of the estate, and the detailed examination of evidence, including witness statements and handwriting analysis. The case also highlights the procedural hurdles in challenging factual findings in higher courts, which is a common issue in complex litigation.

### 1. Summary of the Facts

This case revolves around a probate dispute concerning the validity of two wills left by Mrs. Nina Wang. The 2002 Will, which names the Chinachem Charitable Foundation (Foundation) as the sole beneficiary, was uncontested in terms of its authenticity. However, the Applicant, Chan Chun Chuen, contested the validity of the 2006 Will, which he claimed was entirely his and entitled him to Mrs. Wang’s entire estate. The trial judge, Lam J, found the 2006 Will to be a forgery, and this decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal. The Applicant then sought leave to appeal to the Court of Final Appeal, arguing that the appeal should be granted either as of right or on discretionary grounds. The Court of Final Appeal dismissed the application, concluding that the appeal did not meet the statutory criteria for leave to appeal as of right and that there were no compelling discretionary grounds to grant leave.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments of the Two Parties

**Foundation’s Arguments:**  
The Foundation argued that the Applicant’s appeal did not qualify for leave to appeal as of right under section 22(1)(a) of the Court’s statute. It contended that the appeal involved an indirect claim to property rather than a direct, liquidated monetary claim, which is required for appeals as of right. The Foundation emphasized that the financial impact of the appeal was not immediate or quantifiable, as the trial judge’s findings required further adjudication to determine the extent of the estate’s value. Additionally, the Foundation opposed discretionary leave, arguing that the case did not involve a question of public importance or exceptional circumstances warranting intervention by the Court of Final Appeal.

**Applicant’s Arguments:**  
The Applicant sought leave to appeal as of right, arguing that the case involved an indirect claim to the real and personal property comprising Mrs. Wang’s estate, which exceeded the $1 million threshold. He relied on prior Court of Appeal decisions (e.g., *Wang Din Shin v Nina Kung* and *Re Estate of Mui Yim Fong*) to support the view that probate disputes involving competing wills qualify for leave as of right. On the discretionary grounds, the Applicant argued that the appeal raised a question of public importance regarding the Court’s practice on concurrent findings of fact and that new evidence undermined the trial judge’s findings. He also contended that the Court should abandon its restrictive approach to appeals as of right, aligning with practices in other Commonwealth jurisdictions.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) of the Case

The Court of Final Appeal’s decision in *Chinachem Charitable Foundation Ltd v Chan Chun Chuen* establishes several key legal principles, particularly concerning the interpretation of section 22(1)(a) of the Court’s statute and the Court’s approach to appeals involving factual findings.

#### **(a) Appeals as of Right Under Section 22(1)(a):**
The Court emphasized that appeals as of right are exceptional and narrowly construed. Section 22(1)(a) applies only to claims involving a **direct or indirect claim to property or a proprietary right** of a quantifiable value exceeding $1 million. The Court clarified that:
- **Unliquidated monetary claims** (e.g., damages) fall outside the scope of section 22(1)(a) entirely.
- The claim must involve a **specific property or proprietary right**, not merely an abstract entitlement.
- The **financial impact** of the Court’s decision must be **immediate and quantifiable**, not speculative or contingent on further adjudication.
- The phrase **“directly or indirectly”** describes the nature of the claim but does not relax the requirement for immediacy of economic consequences.

The Court rejected the Applicant’s argument that the appeal involved an indirect claim to property, noting that the trial judge’s findings required further determination of the estate’s value, rendering the financial impact unquantifiable. Thus, the appeal did not meet the criteria for leave as of right.

#### **(b) Discretionary Leave and Concurrent Findings of Fact:**
The Court reaffirmed its **policy against reviewing concurrent findings of fact** by lower courts unless there is a miscarriage of justice or a critical violation of legal principles. Key principles include:
- The Court’s role is to determine **questions of law of general public importance**, not to re-litigate factual disputes.
- **Concurrent findings** (findings made by both the trial judge and the Court of Appeal) are entitled to deference, as they reflect a thorough evaluation of evidence.
- The Court will only intervene if there is a **reasonable basis to believe** that the findings below were erroneous or that a miscarriage of justice occurred.

The Applicant’s arguments challenging the Court’s practice on concurrent findings were dismissed, as they lacked merit and did not demonstrate exceptional circumstances warranting intervention.

#### **(c) New Evidence Ground:**
The Court examined the Applicant’s submission that new Police statements undermined the credibility of a key witness (Winfield Wong). However, it concluded that the evidence did not materially affect the trial judge’s findings. The Court emphasized that **new evidence must demonstrate a risk of miscarriage of justice**, not merely inconsistencies or inaccuracies in witness testimony. The Applicant’s reliance on the new evidence failed to meet this threshold.

#### **(d) Broader Implications for Appeals as of Right:**
The Court expressed a **cautionary view** regarding the continued existence of appeals as of right in Hong Kong, noting that most Commonwealth jurisdictions have abolished this practice. It suggested that Hong Kong should reconsider its approach to align with modern trends in final appellate courts, which prioritize efficiency and the proper administration of justice.

### 4. Anything Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable About the Case

Several aspects of this case stand out as remarkable:
- **High Stakes and Complexity:** The case involved a dispute over a **multibillion-dollar estate**, with intricate evidence including handwriting analysis, witness testimony, and forensic investigations. The trial lasted 40 days, underscoring the complexity of probate litigation involving forgery allegations.
- **Procedural Rigor:** The Court of Final Appeal’s detailed examination of the statutory and common law principles governing appeals as of right and discretionary leave highlights the **rigorous scrutiny** applied to such applications, particularly in high-value probate cases.
- **Witness Credibility Issues:** The case centered on the credibility of key witnesses, including Winfield Wong, whose testimony was challenged through new evidence. The Court’s careful analysis of the witness’s statements and their consistency with other evidence demonstrates the **critical role of factual findings** in probate disputes.
- **Public Policy Considerations:** The Court’s commentary on the **decline of appeals as of right** in Commonwealth jurisdictions and its suggestion that Hong Kong reconsider this practice reflects a broader trend toward streamlining final appellate review and focusing on questions of general public importance.
- **Emphasis on Immediacy of Financial Impact:** The Court’s insistence on the **immediacy and quantifiability** of financial consequences in appeals as of right sets a clear standard for future cases, distinguishing between indirect claims to property and those that qualify for statutory leave.
