Okay, here’s a breakdown of the *W v. The Registrar of Marriages* case, addressing the three requested sections with a detailed and thorough analysis:

**1. Summary of the Facts**

The case centers around W, a post-operative male-to-female transsexual, who seeks to marry a man in Hong Kong. The Registrar of Marriages denied her application, arguing that she doesn’t qualify as a “woman” under the Marriage Ordinance and Matrimonial Causes Ordinance, citing a biological definition of sex. W had undergone surgery to transition and had received official recognition as female by the Hong Kong government, including a new identity card. The case was brought to challenge this denial, arguing that W should be legally recognized as a woman for the purposes of marriage, aligning with evolving international standards and human rights principles. The court examined the historical context of the legislation, the medical advancements in transsexual treatment, and the broader societal shifts regarding gender identity.

**2. Summary of the Arguments**

*   **Appellant (W) & International Commission of Jurists (ICJ):**  W’s legal team argued that the Registrar’s interpretation of “woman” was overly restrictive and outdated. They contended that the legislation should be interpreted to include post-operative transsexuals, recognizing that biological sex is not the sole determinant of gender identity. They emphasized the evolving international consensus, particularly influenced by the European Court of Human Rights’ (ECtHR) decisions, which increasingly recognize the right of transsexual individuals to marry.  They highlighted the importance of protecting minority rights and argued that denying W the right to marry was discriminatory and violated her fundamental human rights. They also pointed to the lack of consensus within Hong Kong society regarding the issue and the need for legislative reform.

*   **Respondent (Registrar of Marriages):** The Registrar maintained that the law’s definition of “woman” – based on biological sex – remained unchanged. They argued that the legislation was enacted based on a traditional understanding of marriage and that any deviation from this definition would have far-reaching consequences, potentially disrupting the institution of marriage and creating legal uncertainty. They emphasized the need for a cautious approach, citing the lack of a clear consensus within Hong Kong society and the potential for unintended consequences. They relied heavily on the precedent set by the *Corbett v Corbett* case, which established a strict biological criterion for determining marital eligibility.



**3. Summary of the Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)**

This case represents a significant shift in legal thinking regarding gender identity and marriage. The Court’s decision, ultimately allowing W to marry, rests on a complex interplay of constitutional interpretation, statutory construction, and evolving human rights principles. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

*   **Statutory Construction – Departing from *Corbett*:** The core of the Court’s reasoning lies in its rejection of the *Corbett* approach. The Court recognized that the *Corbett* decision, based on a strict biological definition of sex, was outdated and no longer aligned with contemporary understandings of gender identity and human rights. The Court explicitly stated that the legislation should be interpreted to include post-operative transsexuals, acknowledging
