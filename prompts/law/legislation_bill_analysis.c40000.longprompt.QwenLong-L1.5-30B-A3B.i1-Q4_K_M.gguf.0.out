<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a detailed bill called the "Protection of Critical Infrastructures (Computer Systems) Bill" and wants answers to four specific questions. I need to make sure I understand each part of the bill and then address each question thoroughly.

First, I'll start with Question A: a summary of the bill, its purpose, and major themes. The bill's title is pretty clear—it's about protecting critical infrastructures' computer systems. The Explanatory Memorandum in the bill mentions the main purposes: protecting computer systems of critical infrastructures, regulating their operators, and providing for investigations into security threats and incidents. So the purpose is to safeguard critical infrastructure's computer systems from threats and incidents, ensuring they're secure and that operators comply with certain obligations.

Major themes would include defining critical infrastructures, designating operators and critical computer systems, imposing obligations on operators (like security management plans, risk assessments, incident reporting), establishing regulatory authorities (Commissioner and designated authorities), and setting up mechanisms for investigations and appeals. The bill also covers penalties for non-compliance, so enforcement is a key theme.

Wait, I should check the structure. The bill is divided into Parts. Part 1 is Preliminary, Part 2 is Regulating Authorities, Part 3 covers Critical Infrastructures, CI Operators, and Critical Computer Systems, Part 4 is Obligations of CI Operators, Part 5 is Responding to Threats and Incidents, Part 6 is Investigation of Offences, Part 7 is Appeals, and Part 8 is Miscellaneous. So the major themes are indeed the regulatory framework, obligations on operators, enforcement mechanisms, and protections for informers and legal privileges.

Moving to Question B: Who does this legislation impact? Who needs to be familiar with it? Who should be concerned? 

The bill targets CI operators (Critical Infrastructure Operators), which are organizations designated under the bill. The definition of critical infrastructure is in Schedule 1, which lists sectors like Energy, IT, Banking, Transport, Healthcare, etc. So companies in those sectors that operate critical infrastructure would be impacted. Also, designated authorities (like the Monetary Authority for Banking, Communications Authority for Telecoms) and the Commissioner. 

Who needs to be familiar? CI operators, their management, legal teams, compliance officers. Regulating authorities (Commissioner, designated authorities) and their staff. Maybe also IT security teams within these organizations. Who should be concerned? Definitely the organizations in the specified sectors, especially those operating critical infrastructure. Also, any service providers they work with, since the bill mentions engaging service providers for security management units. Maybe even government agencies involved in oversight.

Question C: New obligations and rights/powers. Let's look at Part 4, which is all about Obligations of CI Operators. There are three divisions: Organization, Prevention of Threats/Incidents, and Incident Reporting/Response.

Obligations include maintaining an office in Hong Kong (Clause 19), notifying operator changes (Clause 20), setting up a computer-system security management unit (Clause 21). Then, for prevention: notifying material changes to computer systems (Clause 22), submitting and implementing security management plans (Clause 23), conducting risk assessments (Clause 24), arranging security audits (Clause 25). For incident response: participating in security drills (Clause 26), submitting emergency response plans (Clause 27), notifying incidents (Clause 28).

So the new obligations are all these. Onto whom? CI operators. The bill defines CI operators as organizations designated under Section 12. So any organization designated as a CI operator under this bill has these obligations.

New rights/powers: The regulating authorities (Commissioner and designated authorities) have powers to issue directions (Clause 7), issue codes of practice (Clause 8), require information (Clauses 14-17), conduct early interventions (Clauses 29-32), carry out investigations (Clauses 33-40), and prosecute offences (Clause 56). Also, the Commissioner can exempt CI operators from obligations (Clause 55). So the rights/powers are granted to the regulating authorities (Commissioner and designated authorities) and the Commissioner specifically for exemptions.

Wait, the question asks for new rights/powers granted. So the regulating authorities get new powers to direct CI operators, issue codes, require info, conduct investigations, etc. The Commissioner can exempt operators. So those are the new rights/powers.

Question D: All liabilities, including civil and criminal, and the conditions. Need to list all the offences and their penalties. Let's go through the bill.

Starting with Clause 18: Offence for failing to comply with information requirements (Sections 14-17). Penalties: for CI operators, summary conviction up to $5M fine, or $3M and $60k/day for continuing; for others, $500k and $50k/day. Wait, the bill says "if the organization is a CI operator at the time of the offence" vs. "in any other case."

Clause 19: Offence for failing to maintain office in HK or notify changes. Penalties: $500k and $50k/day for indictment, or $300k and $30k/day for summary.

Clause 20: Offence for failing to notify operator changes. Penalties: $5M and $100k/day for indictment, $3M and $60k/day for summary.

Clause 21: Offence for failing to comply with notification about the security management unit. Same as Clause 19, $500k and $50k/day.

Clause 22: Offence for failing to notify material changes. Penalties: $500k and $50k/day.

Clause 23: Offence for failing to submit/submit revised security plans. Same as above, $500k and $50k/day.

Clause 24: Offence for failing to conduct risk assessments or comply with requirements. Same penalties.

Clause 25: Offence for failing to arrange security audits. Same penalties.

Clause 26: Offence for failing to participate in security drills. Penalties: $5M for summary, $5M for indictment (no daily fines mentioned here).

Clause 27: Offence for failing to submit/submit revised emergency response plans. Same as Clause 23, $500k and $50k/day.

Clause 28: Offence for failing to notify incidents. Penalties: $5M for summary, $5M for indictment.

Clause 42: Offence for failing to comply with specified requirements (from early interventions or investigations). Penalties: $500k for summary, $500k for indictment.

Clause 45: Offence for failing to comply with requirements under Section 43 (investigations into offences). Same as Clause 42, $500k.

Clause 58: Offence for contravening Section 57 (preservation of secrecy). Penalties: summary conviction up to 6 months imprisonment and level 6 fine, or indictment up to 2 years and $1M fine.

Wait, let me check each clause. Let's list all the offence clauses:

- Clause 18: Failure to provide information (Sections 14-17). Penalties as above.

- Clause 19: Failure to maintain office or notify changes. Penalties: $300k/$60k/day (summary) or $500k/$50k/day (indictment).

Wait, no, Clause 19(5) says: "A CI operator that commits an offence under subsection (4) is liable—(a) on summary conviction—to a fine of $300,000 and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine of $30,000 for every day during which the offence continues; or (b) on conviction on indictment—to a fine of $500,000 and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine of $50,000 for every day during which the offence continues."

Similarly, Clause 20(3): "A CI operator that commits an offence under subsection (2) is liable—(a) on summary conviction—to a fine of $3,000,000 and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine of $60,000 for every day during which the offence continues; or (b) on conviction on indictment—to a fine of $5,000,000 and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine of $100,000 for every day during which the offence continues."

Wait, so different clauses have different penalties. Let me note each one.

Clause 18: Offence for failing to comply with Sections 14-17. For CI operators: summary $3M/$60k/day, indictment $5M/$100k/day. For others: summary $300k/$30k/day, indictment $500k/$50k/day.

Clause 19: Offence for failing to maintain office or notify changes. CI operators: summary $300k/$30k/day, indictment $500k/$50k/day.

Clause 20: Offence for failing to notify operator changes. CI operators: summary $3M/$60k/day, indictment $5M/$100k/day.

Clause 21: Offence for failing to comply with notification about the security management unit (subsections 4(b) or 6). CI operators: same as Clause 19, $300k/$30k/day summary, $500k/$50k/day indictment.

Clause 22: Offence for failing to notify material changes. CI operators: same as Clause 19, $300k/$30k/day summary, $500k/$50k/day indictment.

Clause 23: Offence for failing to submit/submit revised security plans. CI operators: same as Clause 19, $300k/$30k/day summary, $500k/$50k/day indictment.

Clause 24: Offence for failing to conduct risk assessments or comply with requirements. CI operators: same as above.

Clause 25: Offence for failing to arrange security audits. CI operators: same as above.

Clause 26: Offence for failing to participate in security drills. CI operators: summary $3M, indictment $5M (no daily fines mentioned here).

Clause 27: Offence for failing to submit/submit revised emergency response plans. CI operators: same as Clause 19, $300k/$30k/day summary, $500k/$50k/day indictment.

Clause 28: Offence for failing to notify incidents. CI operators: summary $3M, indictment $5M (no daily fines).

Clause 42: Offence for failing to comply with specified requirements (from early interventions or investigations). Organizations: summary $300k, indictment $500k (no daily fines).

Clause 45: Offence for failing to comply with requirements under Section 43 (investigations into offences). Organizations: same as Clause 42, $300k summary, $500k indictment.

Clause 58: Offence for contravening Section 57 (preservation of secrecy). Summary: fine at level 6 and 6 months imprisonment; indictment: $1M and 2 years imprisonment.

Also, Clause 56 says designated authorities can prosecute offences, but that's a power, not a liability.

Wait, are there any civil liabilities? The bill mentions in Clause 60 that compliance with directions doesn't incur civil liability, but that's a protection, not a liability. The main liabilities are criminal penalties as listed above.

Wait, the question asks for ALL liabilities, including civil and criminal. So I need to check if there are any civil liabilities. Let me scan the bill again.

Clause 60: Immunity from civil liability for complying with directions or requirements. So that's a protection, not a liability. Clause 65: Due diligence defence for certain offences. So the liabilities are the criminal penalties listed in the offence clauses.

Wait, but the question says "liabilities introduced in this bill, including civil and criminal". So if there are no civil liabilities, just list the criminal ones. Let me confirm. The bill doesn't seem to introduce new civil liabilities; the main liabilities are the criminal penalties for non-compliance. So all the offences listed in the clauses above are criminal liabilities.

Wait, but in Clause 18, it's an offence for failing to provide information, which is a criminal offence. Similarly, all the other clauses (19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,42,45,58) are criminal offences with specified penalties.

So the answer for Question D should list all these offences, their penalties, and the conditions (i.e., the specific failure that triggers the liability).

Wait, but the user says "ALL liabilities introduced in this bill, including civil and criminal". So I need to make sure I didn't miss any. Let me check again.

Clause 58 is about contravening Section 57 (preservation of secrecy), which is a criminal offence. Clause 56 is about prosecution, but that's a power, not a liability. Clause 60 is immunity, so no liability there. So the only liabilities are the criminal offences listed in the clauses mentioned.

Wait, but the bill also has Clause 7(8): "A CI operator commits an offence if the operator fails to comply with a direction given under subsection (1) or (2)." So that's another offence. Let me check that.

Clause 7(8): Offence for failing to comply with a direction from a regulating authority. Penalties: same as Clause 18 for CI operators? Wait, Clause 7(9) says: "A CI operator that commits an offence under subsection (8) is liable—(a) on summary conviction—to a fine of $3,000,000 and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine of $60,000 for every day during which the offence continues; or (b) on conviction on indictment—to a fine of $5,000,000 and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine of $100,000 for every day during which the offence continues."

So that's another offence: failing to comply with a direction. So I need to include that in Question D.

So the offences are:

- Clause 7(8): Failure to comply with a direction from regulating authority. Penalties: $3M/$60k/day (summary), $5M/$100k/day (indictment).

- Clause 18: Failure to provide information (Sections 14-17). Penalties: for CI operators, $3M/$60k/day (summary), $5M/$100k/day (indictment); for others, $300k/$30k/day (summary), $500k/$50k/day (indictment).

- Clause 19: Failure to maintain office or notify changes. CI operators: $300k/$30k/day (summary), $500k/$50k/day (indictment).

- Clause 20: Failure to notify operator changes. CI operators: $3M/$60k/day (summary), $5M/$100k/day (indictment).

- Clause 21(7): Failure to comply with notification about security management unit. CI operators: $300k/$30k/day (summary), $500k/$50k/day (indictment).

- Clause 22(4): Failure to notify material changes. CI operators: $300k/$30k/day (summary), $500k/$50k/day (indictment).

- Clause 23(7): Failure to submit/submit revised security plans. CI operators: $300k/$30k/day (summary), $500k/$50k/day (indictment).

- Clause 24(8): Failure to conduct risk assessments or comply with requirements. CI operators: $300k/$30k/day (summary), $500k/$50k/day (indictment).

- Clause 25(10): Failure to arrange security audits. CI operators: $300k/$30k/day (summary), $500k/$50k/day (indictment).

- Clause 26(3): Failure to participate in security drills. CI operators: $3M (summary), $5M (indictment).

- Clause 27(7): Failure to submit/submit revised emergency response plans. CI operators: $300k/$30k/day (summary), $500k/$50k/day (indictment).

- Clause 28(5): Failure to notify incidents. CI operators: $3M (summary), $5M (indictment).

- Clause 42(1): Failure to comply with specified requirements (from early interventions or investigations). Organizations: $300k (summary), $500k (indictment).

- Clause 45(1): Failure to comply with requirements under Section 43 (investigations into offences). Organizations: $300k (summary), $500k (indictment).

- Clause 58(1) and (2): Contravening Section 57 (preservation of secrecy). Summary: fine at level 6 and 6 months imprisonment; indictment: $1M and 2 years imprisonment.

Wait, but Clause 58(2) specifies that a person commits an offence if they disclose information in contravention of Section 57(5), with specific conditions. So that's another offence.

So that's 13 offences. Let me count again to make sure.

1. Clause 7(8): Failure to comply with direction.

2. Clause 18: Failure to provide information.

3. Clause 19: Failure to maintain office/notify changes.

4. Clause 20: Failure to notify operator changes.

5. Clause 21(7): Failure to comply with notification about security management unit.

6. Clause 22(4): Failure to notify material changes.

7. Clause 23(7): Failure to submit/submit security plans.

8. Clause 24(8): Failure to conduct risk assessments.

9. Clause 25(10): Failure to arrange security audits.

10. Clause 26(3): Failure to participate in security drills.

11. Clause 27(7): Failure to submit/submit emergency response plans.

12. Clause 28(5): Failure to notify incidents.

13. Clause 42(1): Failure to comply with specified requirements (early interventions/investigations).

14. Clause 45(1): Failure to comply with requirements under Section 43.

15. Clause 58(1) and (2): Contravening Section 57.

Wait, Clause 58 has two parts: (1) contravening Section 57(1), and (2) disclosing information in contravention of Section 57(5). So that's two separate offences under Clause 58.

So total 15 liabilities? Wait, but the question says "ALL liabilities", so I need to list each one with their conditions.

Wait, but the user might just want the offences listed, so I need to make sure each is included.

Now, let me verify each clause to ensure I didn't miss any.

Clause 7(8): Yes, that's an offence.

Clause 18: Yes.

Clause 19: Yes.

Clause 20: Yes.

Clause 21(7): Yes.

Clause 22(4): Yes.

Clause 23(7): Yes.

Clause 24(8): Yes.

Clause 25(10): Yes.

Clause 26(3): Yes.

Clause 27(7): Yes.

Clause 28(5): Yes.

Clause 42(1): Yes.

Clause 45(1): Yes.

Clause 58(1) and (2): Yes.

So that's 14 offences (since Clause 58 has two parts). Wait, Clause 58(1) and (2) are two separate offences, so total 15 liabilities.

Wait, but let's check the exact wording.

Clause 58(1): "A person who contravenes section 57(1) commits an offence."

Clause 58(2): "A person commits an offence if—(a) the person discloses any information in contravention of section 57(5); and (b) at the time of the disclosure—(i) the person knew, or ought to have known, that the information was previously disclosed to the person or any other person under section 57(1), (2) or (3) (other than section 57(2)(a) or (3)(c)); and (ii) the person had no reasonable grounds to believe that section 57(5) did not apply to the person by virtue of section 57(6)."

So two distinct offences under Clause 58. So total 15 liabilities.

Wait, but the user asked for "ALL liabilities", so I need to list each one with the conditions. Let me structure them properly.

Now, for each liability, I need to state:

- The offence (clause and description)

- The liable party (who commits the offence)

- The penalty (summary vs. indictment)

- The conditions (what triggers the liability)

So for example, Clause 7(8): A CI operator commits an offence if they fail to comply with a direction given under subsection (1) or (2). Penalty: $3M/$60k/day (summary), $5M/$100k/day (indictment).

Similarly, Clause 18: An organization commits an offence if they fail to comply with Sections 14-17 without reasonable excuse. Penalties depend on whether the organization is a CI operator or not.

Wait, but the question says "conditions from which they arise", so the conditions are the specific failures that trigger the liability.

So for each offence, the condition is the failure to comply with a specific provision (e.g., failing to provide information as required under Sections 14-17).

Now, I need to make sure I list all of them. Let me go through each clause again.

Starting with Clause 7(8): Failure to comply with a direction from a regulating authority. Condition: failing to comply with a direction given under subsection (1) or (2). Liable: CI operator.

Clause 18: Failure to comply with Sections 14-17 (requiring information). Condition: failing to provide information as required. Liable: organization (CI operator or other).

Clause 19: Failure to maintain office in HK or notify changes. Condition: failing to comply with subsection (1) or (3). Liable: CI operator.

Clause 20: Failure to notify operator changes. Condition: failing to notify within 1 month. Liable: CI operator.

Clause 21(7): Failure to comply with notification about security management unit (subsections 4(b) or 6). Condition: failing to notify the regulating authority of the appointment or change. Liable: CI operator.

Clause 22(4): Failure to notify material changes to computer systems. Condition: failing to notify within 1 month. Liable: CI operator.

Clause 23(7): Failure to submit/submit revised security management plans. Condition: failing to comply with subsection (1) or (4). Liable: CI operator.

Clause 24(8): Failure to conduct risk assessments or comply with requirements. Condition: failing to comply with subsection (1) or a requirement under subsection (5). Liable: CI operator.

Clause 25(10): Failure to arrange security audits. Condition: failing to comply with subsection (1) or a requirement under subsection (4) or (6). Liable: CI operator.

Clause 26(3): Failure to participate in security drills. Condition: failing to comply with a requirement under subsection (2). Liable: CI operator.

Clause 27(7): Failure to submit/submit revised emergency response plans. Condition: failing to comply with subsection (1) or (4). Liable: CI operator.

Clause 28(5): Failure to notify incidents. Condition: failing to comply with subsection (1), (3), or (4). Liable: CI operator.

Clause 42(1): Failure to comply with specified requirements (from early interventions or investigations). Condition: failing to comply with a specified requirement. Liable: organization.

Clause 45(1): Failure to comply with requirements under Section 43. Condition: failing to comply with a requirement imposed under Section 43. Liable: organization.

Clause 58(1): Contravening Section 57(1). Condition: failing to preserve secrecy as required. Liable: specified person (as defined in Clause 57(10)).

Clause 58(2): Disclosing information in contravention of Section 57(5). Condition: disclosing information in contravention of Section 57(5), with specific knowledge conditions. Liable: person.

So that's all 15 liabilities. Wait, but let's confirm the number. Let's count:

1. Clause 7(8)

2. Clause 18

3. Clause 19

4. Clause 20

5. Clause 21(7)

6. Clause 22(4)

7. Clause 23(7)

8. Clause 24(8)

9. Clause 25(10)

10. Clause 26(3)

11. Clause 27(7)

12. Clause 28(5)

13. Clause 42(1)

14. Clause 45(1)

15. Clause 58(1)

16. Clause 58(2)

Wait, that's 16. Wait, no, Clause 58 has two parts, so 15 total? Wait, 1-14 are 14, then 15 and 16 for Clause 58. So 16 liabilities. Wait, but let's check the bill again.

Wait, the bill lists Clause 58 as:

58. Offences relating to section 57

(1) A person who contravenes section 57(1) commits an offence.

(2) A person commits an offence if—

(a) the person discloses any information in contravention of section 57(5); and

(b) at the time of the disclosure—

(i) the person knew, or ought to have known, that the information was previously disclosed to the person or any other person under section 57(1), (2) or (3) (other than section 57(2)(a) or (3)(c)); and

(ii) the person had no reasonable grounds to believe that section 57(5) did not apply to the person by virtue of section 57(6).

(3) A person who commits an offence under subsection (1) or (2) is liable—

(a) on summary conviction—to a fine at level 6 and to imprisonment for 6 months; or

(b) on conviction on indictment—to a fine of $1,000,000 and to imprisonment for 2 years.

So Clause 58(1) and (2) are two separate offences, so that's two liabilities. So total 15 liabilities (14 from the other clauses plus two from Clause 58). Wait, 14 + 2 = 16. Wait, but let's count the other clauses:

1. Clause 7(8)

2. Clause 18

3. Clause 19

4. Clause 20

5. Clause 21(7)

6. Clause 22(4)

7. Clause 23(7)

8. Clause 24(8)

9. Clause 25(10)

10. Clause 26(3)

11. Clause 27(7)

12. Clause 28(5)

13. Clause 42(1)

14. Clause 45(1)

15. Clause 58(1)

16. Clause 58(2)

Yes, 16 liabilities. So I need to list all 16.

Wait, but the user said "ALL liabilities", so I need to make sure I don't miss any. Let me check if there are any others.

Clause 56: Designated authorities may prosecute offences. That's a power, not a liability. Clause 57: Preservation of secrecy, which leads to the offences in Clause 58. So no other liabilities.

Okay, so the answer for Question D will list all 16 liabilities with their conditions and penalties.

Now, let's make sure I have all the penalties correct. For example, Clause 26(3) says: "A CI operator that commits an offence under subsection (3) is liable—(a) on summary conviction—to a fine of $3,000,000; or (b) on conviction on indictment—to a fine of $5,000,000." So no daily fines for continuing offences here, unlike some other clauses.

Similarly, Clause 28(5) says: "A CI operator that commits an offence under subsection (5) is liable—(a) on summary conviction—to a fine of $3,000,000; or (b) on conviction on indictment—to a fine of $5,000,000." So same as Clause 26.

For Clause 42(3): "An organization that commits an offence under subsection (1) is liable—(a) on summary conviction—to a fine of $300,000; or (b) on conviction on indictment—to a fine of $500,000." So no daily fines here.

Same for Clause 45(3): same penalties as Clause 42.

Clause 58(3): summary conviction is a fine at level 6 and 6 months imprisonment; indictment is $1M and 2 years.

Okay, so I need to present all these clearly.

Now, moving back to the other questions.

Question A: Summary, purpose, major themes.

Purpose: To protect the security of computer systems of Hong Kong's critical infrastructures, regulate their operators, and provide for investigation and response to security threats and incidents.

Major themes: Defining critical infrastructure and CI operators; imposing security obligations on CI operators (security management plans, risk assessments, incident reporting); establishing regulatory bodies (Commissioner and designated authorities); granting powers to regulators (directions, codes of practice, investigations); enforcement mechanisms (penalties, appeals); confidentiality and immunity provisions.

Question B: Who is impacted? CI operators (organizations in specified sectors like Energy, IT, Banking, Transport, Healthcare, Telecoms). Also, designated authorities (e.g., Monetary Authority, Communications Authority) and the Commissioner. Who needs to be familiar? CI operators' compliance teams, legal departments, IT security staff; regulators and their staff. Who should be concerned? All organizations operating critical infrastructure in the specified sectors, as they will be designated as CI operators and must comply with the obligations.

Wait, but the bill says "critical infrastructure" is defined in Schedule 1 as sectors like Energy, IT, Banking, etc. So organizations in those sectors that operate critical infrastructure (i.e., infrastructure essential to the continuous provision of essential services in those sectors) will be designated as CI operators. So the impact is on those specific organizations. The bill also mentions that a CI operator can be an organization operating more than one critical infrastructure, so some organizations might have multiple designations.

Question C: New obligations onto CI operators (as listed in Part 4), and new rights/powers onto regulating authorities (Commissioner and designated authorities).

Obligations:

- Maintain office in HK (Clause 19)

- Notify operator changes (Clause 20)

- Set up and maintain computer-system security management unit (Clause 21)

- Notify material changes to computer systems (Clause 22)

- Submit and implement security management plans (Clause 23)

- Conduct risk assessments (Clause 24)

- Arrange security audits (Clause 25)

- Participate in security drills (Clause 26)

- Submit and implement emergency response plans (Clause 27)

- Notify security incidents (Clause 28)

Rights/powers:

- Regulating authorities (Commissioner and designated authorities) can give directions to CI operators (Clause 7)

- Issue codes of practice (Clause 8)

- Require information (Clauses 14-17)

- Conduct early interventions (Clauses 29-32)

- Conduct investigations (Clauses 33-40)

- Prosecute offences (Clause 56)

- Commissioner can exempt CI operators from obligations (Clause 55)

So the new rights/powers are granted to the regulating authorities (Commissioner and designated authorities).

Now, I need to structure the answers clearly. Let me make sure I don't miss any key points.

Wait, the bill also has provisions for appeals (Part 7), which is important for affected organizations to challenge decisions, but that's part of the process, not a liability or obligation.

Also, the bill mentions that the Commissioner can perform functions for designated authorities if necessary (Clause 54), which is a power for the Commissioner.

Okay, I think I have all the necessary information. Now, let's draft the answers.
</think>

### **Question A: Summary of the Bill, Its Purpose, and Major Themes**

**Summary**:  
The *Protection of Critical Infrastructures (Computer Systems) Bill* establishes a regulatory framework to safeguard Hong Kong’s critical infrastructure computer systems from security threats and incidents. It defines "critical infrastructure" (e.g., energy, banking, healthcare, transport, telecommunications) and designates operators ("CI operators") responsible for these systems. The bill imposes strict security obligations on CI operators, empowers regulatory authorities (the Commissioner and designated authorities), and outlines mechanisms for early intervention, investigations, and enforcement. It also includes provisions for appeals, confidentiality, immunity, and penalties for non-compliance.

**Purpose**:  
The primary purpose is to **protect the security of computer systems supporting Hong Kong’s critical infrastructure**, **regulate CI operators**, and **provide for the investigation and response to computer-system security threats and incidents**. This ensures the resilience of essential services (e.g., power, finance, healthcare) against cyber threats.

**Major Themes**:  
1. **Definition and Designation**:  
   - Critical infrastructure is defined in **Schedule 1** (sectors: energy, IT, banking, transport, healthcare, telecoms).  
   - CI operators are designated by the Commissioner or designated authorities (e.g., Monetary Authority for banking, Communications Authority for telecoms).  
2. **Obligations for CI Operators**:  
   - Mandatory security management plans, risk assessments, audits, incident reporting, and drills.  
   - Requirements to maintain offices in Hong Kong, notify changes, and establish security management units.  
3. **Regulatory Powers**:  
   - Regulating authorities (Commissioner/designated authorities) can issue directions, codes of practice, require information, and conduct investigations.  
   - Powers to enter premises, issue warrants, and prosecute offences.  
4. **Enforcement and Penalties**:  
   - Significant criminal penalties for non-compliance (fines up to $5 million, imprisonment).  
   - Due diligence and reasonable excuse defenses for certain offences.  
5. **Confidentiality and Immunity**:  
   - Strict secrecy obligations (Section 57) and immunity for compliance with regulatory directions (Section 60).  
6. **Appeals and Oversight**:  
   - Appeal panel (with IT/legal expertise) to review regulatory decisions.
