For each sale, the Secretary is required to offer at least 50 percent of available parcels nominated for development under existing resource management plans. The bill repeals Inflation Reduction Act provisions regarding royalty rates and noncompetitive leasing, restoring previous laws and mandating that lease sales occur within 18 months of an expression of interest. Additionally, the Secretary must conduct replacement sales if a sale is canceled or if 25 percent or more of the offered acreage receives no bids.

**Sec. 50102. Offshore Oil and Gas Leasing.**

For Gulf sales, the Secretary must offer at least 80,000,000 acres per sale with royalty rates set between 12.5 percent and 16.67 percent, while Alaska sales must offer at least 1,000,000 acres. Beginning in fiscal year 2034, 70 percent of revenues from Alaska offshore sales will be paid to the State of Alaska, with the remaining 30 percent going to the Treasury. The bill also mandates the approval of commingling production from multiple reservoirs in the Gulf of America unless safety or recovery reduction is conclusively proven.

**Sec. 50103. Royalties on Extracted Methane.**

The Secretary of the Interior must conduct at least four area-wide lease sales on the Coastal Plain of Alaska within 10 years of enactment, offering not fewer than 400,000 acres per sale.

**Sec. 50202. Coal Royalty.**
The coal royalty rate under the Mineral Leasing Act is temporarily reduced to a maximum of 7 percent for the period beginning on the enactment date and ending on September 30, 2034.

**Sec. 50203. Leases for Known Recoverable Coal Resources.**
Within 90 days of enactment, the Secretary of the Interior must make available for lease at least 4,000,000 additional acres of known recoverable coal resources on Federal land in the 48 contiguous states and Alaska.

**Sec. 50204. Authorization to Mine Federal Coal.**
The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to mine Federal coal reserves located on Federal land that are adjacent to State or private coal reserves, provided these reserves were part of a mining plan approved prior to enactment. Within 90 days of enactment, the Secretary must take necessary steps to authorize this mining without substantial modification to the existing plan. This authorization does not prevent a review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.

For fiscal years 2026 through 2034, the Secretary of Agriculture must sell timber on National Forest System land in quantities at least 250,000,000 board-feet greater than the previous year, while the Secretary of the Interior must increase BLM timber sales by at least 20,000,000 board-feet annually. Both agencies must enter into long-term contracts for the sale of materials: the Forest Service must sign at least 40 contracts of 20 years or more, and the BLM must sign at least 5 such contracts.

**Sec. 50302. Renewable Energy Fees on Federal Land.**
The Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture must collect acreage rent and capacity fees from renewable energy projects on public lands, calculated using a specific formula involving per-acre rates, encumbrance factors, and annual adjustments. Solar facilities face a 100 percent encumbrance factor, while wind facilities face a factor of at least 10 percent, and capacity fees are set at the greater of the acreage rent or 3.9 percent of gross electricity sales proceeds. A 10 percent reduction in capacity fees is available for wind projects if at least 25 percent of the land is used for other activities, and rights-of-way may be terminated if payments are not received within 90 days of the due date.

**Sec. 50303. Renewable Energy Revenue Sharing.**
Beginning January 1, 2026, revenues from renewable energy projects on covered land, including bonus bids, rentals, and fees, must be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury and allocated as follows: 25 percent to the State where the revenue is derived and 25 percent to the counties within that State based on the percentage of land generating the revenue. These payments are made without further appropriation and must be used in accordance with the requirements of section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act. Payments to counties are in addition to any payments in lieu of taxes they may already receive.

The Secretary of Energy is appropriated $1,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2025 to carry out these activities, with funds remaining available through September 30, 2028, and no more than 3 percent may be used for administrative expenses.

**Sec. 50404. Transformational Artificial Intelligence Models.**
The Secretary of Energy must mobilize National Laboratories to curate and preprocess scientific data for use in artificial intelligence and machine learning models, initiating seed efforts for self-improving models for science and engineering. These models are intended to accelerate the development of next-generation microelectronics and new energy technologies, with data made available to the scientific community through the American science cloud. The Secretary is appropriated $150,000,000 for fiscal year 2025 to carry out these activities, with funds remaining available through September 30, 2026.
