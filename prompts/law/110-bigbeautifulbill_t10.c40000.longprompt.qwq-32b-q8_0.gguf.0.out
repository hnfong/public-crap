Okay, I need to help the user understand this big bill by summarizing each section starting with Sec. 100001. Let me start by reading through the provided sections carefully. 

First, the user wants a summary for each "Sec. XXXX" section. Each summary should be a paragraph, up to four sentences, but at least one. I have to be specific about parties, entities, and numbers. Also, keep it concise but not vague. 

Starting with Sec. 100001: APPLICABILITY OF THE IMMIGRATION LAWS. The section talks about applying fees under the subtitle to aliens in specific situations. It defines terms using the Immigration and Nationality Act. So the key points are the applicability of fees and the definitions. 

Next, Sec. 100002: ASYLUM FEE. This requires asylum applicants to pay a fee starting at $100 in 2025, adjusted for inflation. The fees are split between different agencies, and no waivers are allowed. I need to mention the initial amount, inflation adjustment, distribution of funds, and no waivers.

Then, Sec. 100003: EMPLOYMENT AUTHORIZATION DOCUMENT FEES. This has subsections for asylum applicants, parolees, and TPS holders. Each has different fee amounts and dispositions. For example, asylum applicants pay $550 initially, with 25% going to USCIS for fraud prevention. Parolees and TPS fees go to the general fund. Also, no waivers.

Continuing through each section, I need to note the key elements: who is affected, the fee amount, how it's adjusted, where the money goes, and any exceptions or restrictions. For example, Sec. 100004 (Immigration Parole Fee) has exceptions for medical emergencies, family situations, etc., and the fee is $1000 initially.

I should also watch for sections that modify existing laws, like Sec. 100006 amending the TPS fee to $500 with inflation adjustments. Each section's main action (amending a law, setting a fee, allocating funds) needs to be clear.

When I get to funding sections like Sec. 100051 (DHS appropriation), the key points are the total amount ($2.055 billion), the purposes like hiring agents, removal costs, and specific programs like handling unaccompanied children.

I need to ensure each summary is concise, hits all significant details without being too wordy. Also, check that entities like USCIS, EOIR, ICE are mentioned where relevant. Quantities like dollar amounts and percentages must be included accurately.

Let me go through each section one by one, extract the main points, and format them as per the user's instructions. Make sure not to miss any sections listed in the provided text. Also, confirm that the summaries start with Sec. 100001 as specified.
