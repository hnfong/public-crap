### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case of KWOK CHEUK KIN AND ANOTHER v. DIRECTOR OF LANDS AND OTHERS [2021] HKCA 54 involves a challenge to the New Territories Small House Policy (Small House Policy), which grants indigenous New Territories inhabitants (NTIIs) the right to build small houses on their land. The policy, introduced in 1972, allows eligible NTIIs to apply for permission to build a small house on a suitable site within their village, subject to certain criteria, including being a male descendant of a 1898 resident of a recognized village. The policy provides for three forms of land grants: free building licence, private treaty grant, and exchange.

The applicants, who are not eligible under the policy, challenged the constitutionality of the Small House Policy on the grounds that it discriminates against non-indigenous residents and female NTIIs, in violation of articles 25 and 39 of the Basic Law (BL) and article 22 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights (BOR). The respondents and interested party argued that the policy is constitutional under article 40 of the Basic Law (BL40), which protects the lawful traditional rights and interests of NTIIs.

The lower court found that the policy is discriminatory but held that the Ding Rights (the right to apply for a small house grant) are protected under BL40, thus rendering the policy constitutional to the extent that it confers benefits in the form of free building licences. However, the court declared the policy unconstitutional to the extent that it confers benefits in the form of private treaty grant or exchange.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments

**Applicants' Arguments:**
- The Small House Policy is discriminatory and violates articles 25 and 39 of the Basic Law and article 22 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights.
- The Ding Rights are not "lawful traditional rights and interests" under BL40 because they are not traceable to pre-1898 practices and are discriminatory.
- The policy should be declared unconstitutional in its entirety, including the forms of private treaty grant and exchange.

**Respondents and Interested Party's Arguments:**
- The Small House Policy is constitutional under BL40, which protects the lawful traditional rights and interests of NTIIs.
- The Ding Rights, including private treaty grant and exchange, are lawful traditional rights and interests because they are traceable to pre-1898 practices and have been recognized and accepted by the Hong Kong legal system.
- The policy should be upheld in its entirety, as it is a continuation of traditional practices and is protected by BL40.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

**Context and Purpose of BL40:**
- The court adopted a contextual and purposive approach to interpret BL40, considering the historical context and purpose of the provision.
- BL40 aims to protect the lawful traditional rights and interests of NTIIs, which were recognized and accepted in the Hong Kong legal system at the time of the Basic Law's promulgation in 1990.

**Definition of "Lawful Traditional Rights and Interests":**
- "Lawful" refers to rights and interests recognized as lawful in the Hong Kong legal system at the time of the Basic Law's promulgation, not by reference to pre-1997 laws or post-1997 laws.
- "Traditional" means rights and interests that originated from and retained the essence of pre-1898 customs, despite changes and disruptions over time.

**Ding Rights as Lawful Traditional Rights and Interests:**
- The Ding Rights, including private treaty grant and exchange, are lawful traditional rights and interests of NTIIs because they are traceable to pre-1898 customs and have been recognized and accepted by the Hong Kong legal system.
- The rights are protected under BL40 despite their discriminatory nature, as the drafters intended to protect traditional rights and interests without subjecting them to post-1997 legal challenges based on discrimination.

**Coherence Principle:**
- BL40 must be read coherently with other provisions of the Basic Law, such as BL120 and BL122, which confirm the continued recognition and protection of small house grants.
- The coherence principle supports the interpretation that the Ding Rights are protected under BL40, ensuring a consistent constitutional scheme.

**Reservations to CEDAW:**
- The reservations made by the UK and PRC Governments to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) with respect to the Small House Policy provide a weighty aid to interpreting BL40.
- These reservations ensure the continued application of the Ding Rights despite their discriminatory nature, reinforcing the protection of these rights under BL40.

**Standing and Delay:**
- The applicants lacked standing to bring the judicial review as they did not demonstrate any direct interest in the land or housing benefits affected by the Small House Policy.
- The substantial delay in bringing the application, without any explanation, caused prejudice to third parties and detriment to good administration, justifying the refusal of relief.

**Conclusion:**
- The Ding Rights, including private treaty grant and exchange, are protected under BL40 as lawful traditional rights and interests of NTIIs.
- The Small House Policy is constitutional in its entirety, and the applicants' challenge is dismissed on the grounds of lack of standing and delay. [end of text]
