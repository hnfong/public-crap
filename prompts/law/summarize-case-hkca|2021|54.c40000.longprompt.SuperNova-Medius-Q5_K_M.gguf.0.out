### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case of KWOK CHEUK KIN AND ANOTHER v. DIRECTOR OF LANDS AND OTHERS [2021] HKCA 54 involves a challenge to the New Territories Small House Policy (Small House Policy), which grants indigenous New Territories inhabitants (NTIIs) the right to build small houses on their land. The policy, introduced in 1972, is discriminatory on the grounds of social origin and sex, as it only allows male descendants of 1898 residents to apply for small house grants. The applicants, who are not eligible under the policy, argued that it is unconstitutional and discriminatory under the Basic Law (BL) and the Hong Kong Bill of Rights (BOR). The respondents and interested party (Heung Yee Kuk) argued that the policy is protected under Article 40 of the Basic Law (BL40), which safeguards the lawful traditional rights and interests of NTIIs.

### 2. Arguments of the Parties

**Applicants' Arguments:**
- The Small House Policy is discriminatory and unconstitutional under Articles 25 and 39 of the Basic Law (BL25 and BL39) and Article 22 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights (BOR22).
- The policy discriminates against non-indigenous residents and female NTIIs.
- The policy is not a lawful traditional right or interest under BL40, as it is not traceable to pre-1898 practices and is discriminatory.
- The applicants lack standing and the delay in bringing the case is justified.

**Respondents and Interested Party's Arguments:**
- The Small House Policy is a lawful traditional right or interest under BL40, as it is traceable to pre-1898 practices and was recognized by the colonial government.
- The policy is protected under BL40, which aims to preserve the rights and interests of NTIIs despite their discriminatory nature.
- The applicants lack standing and the delay in bringing the case is unjustified, causing substantial prejudice to third parties and the administration.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The Court of Appeal held that the Small House Policy is constitutional and lawful under Article 40 of the Basic Law (BL40). The key legal principles are:

**a. Interpretation of BL40:**
- BL40 protects the lawful traditional rights and interests of NTIIs, which includes the Ding Rights (the right to build small houses).
- The term "traditional" in BL40 refers to rights and interests that existed and were recognized in the Hong Kong legal system at the time of the Basic Law's promulgation in 1990.
- The term "lawful" in BL40 means that the rights and interests were recognized as lawful in the Hong Kong legal system at the time of the Basic Law's promulgation, not that they must be non-discriminatory.

**b. Historical Context and Continuity:**
- The Small House Policy is a continuation of pre-1898 customs and practices, which were recognized and protected by the colonial government.
- The policy was never subject to legal challenge and was embedded in legislation and government policy, giving rise to legal consequences enforceable in court.

**c. Coherence Principle:**
- BL40 must be read together with other articles of the Basic Law, such as BL120 and BL122, which confirm the protection of small house grants.
- The coherence principle mandates that BL40 be read in light of other articles addressing similar subject matter, such as the Joint Declaration and the CEDAW reservations, to produce a harmonious and congruous meaning.

**d. Discrimination and Reservations:**
- The reservations made by the UK and PRC governments under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) exclude a discrimination challenge based on sex.
- The coherence principle extends this exclusion to other grounds of discrimination, such as birth or social origin, ensuring a coherent constitutional scheme to protect the Ding Rights.

**e. Standing and Delay:**
- The applicants lack standing as they have not demonstrated any interest over and above that of an ordinary resident, which would give them standing to bring the judicial review.
- The delay in bringing the case is serious and unjustified, causing substantial prejudice to third parties and the administration.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case

**a. Constitutional Protection of Discriminatory Policies:**
The case is remarkable for its conclusion that a discriminatory policy can be protected under a constitutional provision. The Court's decision to shield the Small House Policy from discrimination challenges, despite its inherently discriminatory nature, is a significant departure from traditional constitutional principles.

**b. Historical and Cultural Context:**
The extensive historical survey of the New Territories' land tenure and the Small House Policy provides a unique insight into the evolution of land rights and indigenous practices in Hong Kong. This detailed historical context is unusual in constitutional cases and highlights the importance of understanding cultural and historical factors in legal interpretation.

**c. Coherence Principle and International Reservations:**
The application of the coherence principle to interpret BL40 in light of international reservations (CEDAW) is a novel approach. It demonstrates how international agreements and reservations can influence the interpretation of domestic constitutional provisions, even in cases of potential discrimination.

**d. Impact on Land Administration:**
The decision has significant implications for land administration in the New Territories, as it upholds the Small House Policy as a valid and lawful policy. This could affect future land allocation and planning decisions, ensuring consistency and stability in the administration of land rights.

**e. Judicial Review and Standing:**
The case highlights the importance of standing and the potential for judicial review to be dismissed on grounds of delay and lack of standing, even if the underlying policy is found to be constitutional. This aspect of the decision underscores the need for timely legal challenges and the careful consideration of standing requirements in constitutional cases. [end of text]
