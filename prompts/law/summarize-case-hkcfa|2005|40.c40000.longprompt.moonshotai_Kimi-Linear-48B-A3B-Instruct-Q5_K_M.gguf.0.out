### 1. Brief Summary of the Facts

The case **Leung Kwok Hung and Others v. HKSAR** ([2005] HKCFA 40) concerns the constitutionality of Hong Kong's **Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245)**. The appellants, Leung Kwok Hung and two others, were convicted under **Section 17A(3)(b)(i)** of the Ordinance for organizing an unauthorized public procession on **10 February 2002** without prior notification to the Commissioner of Police. The procession, consisting of about 96 people, was held to protest the conviction of an activist. The police had warned the organizers about the notification requirement, but it was not complied with. The appellants argued that the Ordinance's provisions allowing the Commissioner of Police to restrict public processions for reasons like "public order (ordre public)" were unconstitutional. The Court of Appeal upheld their convictions, but the appellants appealed to the **Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal (CFA)**.

### 2. Arguments of the Two Parties

#### **Appellants' Arguments:**
- The **Public Order Ordinance** violated the **Basic Law** (Article 27, which guarantees freedom of assembly) and the **Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance** (Article 17, mirroring ICCPR Article 21).
- The **Commissioner of Police's discretion** to restrict processions for "public order (ordre public)" was **too vague and uncertain**, violating the constitutional requirement of **"prescribed by law"** (Article 39(2) of the Basic Law).
- The Ordinance's **prior restraint powers** (e.g., prohibiting or imposing conditions on processions) were **unconstitutional** because they could be used to suppress peaceful assemblies.
- The **criminal penalties** under **Section 17A** were **inextricably linked** to the unconstitutional powers and should also be struck down.

#### **Respondent's (Government's) Arguments:**
- The **notification requirement** (Sections 8 and 13A) was constitutional, as it merely ensured proper policing and did not unduly restrict assembly.
- The **Commissioner's discretion** to restrict processions for "public order" was **sufficiently certain** and **necessary** in a democratic society.
- The **Appeal Board** and **judicial review** mechanisms provided sufficient safeguards against arbitrary restrictions.
- The **criminal offense** (Section 17A) was **independent** of the unconstitutional powers and should not be struck down.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi) – Detailed Analysis

#### **A. Constitutional Framework**
- **Article 27 of the Basic Law** guarantees freedoms of assembly, procession, and demonstration.
- **Article 39(2) of the Basic Law** requires that any restrictions on rights must comply with the **ICCPR** (as applied to Hong Kong).
- **Article 17 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights Ordinance (BORO)** mirrors **ICCPR Article 21**, guaranteeing the right to peaceful assembly with restrictions only if necessary in a democratic society.

#### **B. "Prescribed by Law" Requirement**
- The **"prescribed by law"** test (from **Article 39(2)**) requires that restrictions must be **clear, accessible, and precise** (per **Shum Kwok Sher v. HKSAR**).
- The **Commissioner’s discretion** to restrict processions for "public order (ordre public)" was **unconstitutional** because:
  - The term "public order (ordre public)" is **vague and imprecise** (per **Ng Kung Siu** and **Kiss**).
  - It **fails to provide adequate guidance** to citizens and officials on when restrictions may be imposed.
  - It **risks arbitrary enforcement**, chilling legitimate assemblies (per **Malone v. UK** and **Shuttlesworth v. City of Birmingham**).

#### **C. Necessity and Proportionality**
- Restrictions must be **necessary in a democratic society** (per **ICCPR Article 21**).
- The **proportionality test** requires:
  1. The restriction must be **rationally connected** to a legitimate purpose.
  2. The restriction must be **no more than necessary** to achieve that purpose.
- The **Commissioner’s discretion** was **not narrowly tailored**:
  - It allowed **prior restraint** (banning processions) without sufficient safeguards.
  - It **lacked a "freedom-friendly" standard** (e.g., requiring a "clear and present danger" test).
  - The **threshold for intervention** was too low (mere "reasonable belief" of disorder).

#### **D. Severability and Remedy**
- The **Court severed "public order (ordre public)"** from the statutory provisions, leaving only **"public order" (in the law-and-order sense)**.
- This **preserved the notification requirement** (Sections 8 & 13A) but **struck down the prior restraint powers** (Sections 9, 11, 14, 15).
- The **criminal offense (Section 17A)** was **inextricably linked** to the unconstitutional powers and was also struck down.

#### **E. Positive Duty on the State**
- The government has a **positive duty** to facilitate peaceful assemblies (per **Plattform ‘Ärzte für das Leben’ v. Austria**).
- The **notification system** was justified as a **reasonable measure** to ensure public safety and order.
