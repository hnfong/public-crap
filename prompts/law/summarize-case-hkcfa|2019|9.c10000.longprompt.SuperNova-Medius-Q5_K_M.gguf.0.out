### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case of Secretary for Justice v Cheng Ka Yee and 3 Others [2019] HKCFA 9 involves four primary school teachers and a friend who were charged under Section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200) for obtaining access to a computer with a view to dishonest gain. The events took place on June 13, 2014, when the teachers were briefed on the upcoming competitive admission interviews for their school. During the briefing, the teachers took photographs of the interview questions using their mobile phones and transmitted them to third parties. The third respondent used a school computer to type up the questions and send them via email and WhatsApp. 

The charges against the respondents were that they had obtained access to a computer with a view to dishonest gain for another. The first, second, and fourth respondents were charged for using their own smartphones, while the third respondent was charged for using a school computer. The Magistrate acquitted all four respondents, finding that there was a reasonable doubt about the need for confidentiality and that the prosecution had not proven the element of dishonesty beyond a reasonable doubt. The Secretary for Justice appealed the decision, arguing that the charges were appropriate and that the respondents had committed the actus reus of the offense.

### 2. Summary of the Arguments

**Arguments of the Secretary for Justice (Appellant):**

The Secretary for Justice argued that the charges against the respondents were appropriate and that they had committed the actus reus of the offense under Section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance. The appellant contended that the term "obtain access to a computer" should be interpreted broadly to include the use of one's own computer, not just someone else's. The appellant pointed out that technology had advanced significantly since the enactment of the Computer Crimes Ordinance 1993, and that a narrow interpretation of the statute would undermine its purpose and efficacy in combating computer-related crime. The appellant cited several examples of computer misuse that could not have been foreseen at the time of the statute's enactment, arguing that these cases fall within the language of Section 161(1)(c).

**Arguments of the Respondents:**

The respondents argued that the charges against them were inappropriate and that they had not committed the actus reus of the offense. They contended that the term "obtain access to a computer" should be interpreted narrowly to mean unauthorized access to someone else's computer. The respondents argued that using their own smartphones or a school computer allocated to them did not constitute "obtaining access" to a computer within the meaning of the statute. They also argued that the prosecution had not proven the element of dishonesty beyond a reasonable doubt, and that the Magistrate's decision to acquit them was correct.

### 3. Summary of the Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The key legal principle in this case is the interpretation of Section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance, which criminalizes obtaining access to a computer with a view to dishonest gain for oneself or another. The Court of Final Appeal held that the term "obtain access to a computer" does not apply to the use of one's own computer, unless that use involves accessing another computer. The Court's reasoning is based on the text, context, and purpose of the statute.

**Textual Analysis:**

The Court noted that the ordinary meaning of the words "obtain" and "access" suggests unauthorized use of a computer. The verb "obtain" implies gaining something that one did not previously have, and "access" implies gaining admittance to something. The Court found that applying these terms to the use of one's own computer would be redundant and odd, as one always has access to their own device.

**Contextual Analysis:**

The Court considered the legislative history and the context in which Section 161 was enacted. The Computer Crimes Ordinance 1993 was designed to address computer-related crime and to create preparatory offenses. The purpose of the new section was to criminalize the act of gaining access to a computer with dishonest intent, which would apply to cases where a person uses someone else's computer to prepare for a future offense. The Court noted that the other provisions enacted by the Computer Crimes Ordinance 1993 generally referred to access to or misuse of a computer other than the offender's own computer.

**Purpose Analysis:**

The Court found that the purpose of Section 161 was to create preparatory offenses, which would be easier to prove than substantive offenses. The Court noted that the practical difficulty of establishing a preparatory mens rea may be lessened where it is connected to an actus reus involving the wrongful use of someone else's computer. The Court concluded that a construction of Section 161 that extends to the use of one's own computer would be inconsistent with the statute's purpose.

**Conclusion:**

The Court held that Section 161(1)(c) does not apply to the use of one's own computer, unless that use involves accessing another computer. The Court dismissed the appeal, finding that the respondents had not committed the actus reus of the offense as defined by the statute. The Court emphasized that the purpose of statutory construction is to ascertain the purpose of the statute to inform its construction, rather than to identify a desirable public policy and construe the statute to fit it.

This case highlights the importance of statutory construction in criminal law and the need to interpret statutes in a way that is consistent with their text, context, and purpose. The Court's decision provides guidance on the scope of the actus reus of the offense under Section 161(1)(c) and clarifies the limits of the statute's application. The decision is significant as it addresses the evolving nature of computer-related crime and the challenges of interpreting statutes in the context of technological advancements. [end of text]
