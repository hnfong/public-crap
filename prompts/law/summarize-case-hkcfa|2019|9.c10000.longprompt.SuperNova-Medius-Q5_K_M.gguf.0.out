### 1. Summary of the Facts

The case involves four primary school teachers and a friend who were charged under Section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance (Cap 200) for obtaining access to a computer with a view to dishonest gain. The incident occurred on June 13, 2014, when the teachers were briefed on the upcoming competitive admission interviews for their school. During the briefing, the teachers used their personal mobile phones and a school computer to take photographs of and transmit the interview questions to third parties. The charges against each respondent were based on their use of their respective devices (smartphones or a school desktop computer) to send the interview questions to others.

The respondents were acquitted by a Magistrate, who found that there was a reasonable doubt about the need for confidentiality and that the prosecution had not proven the element of dishonesty beyond a reasonable doubt. The Secretary for Justice appealed the decision, arguing that the Magistrate's interpretation of the law was incorrect.

### 2. Arguments of the Two Parties

**Secretary for Justice (Appellant):**
- The appellant argued that the respondents' actions constituted the actus reus of the offense under Section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance. 
- They contended that the use of personal devices to transmit confidential information should be considered "obtaining access to a computer" within the meaning of the statute.
- The appellant emphasized that the statute should be interpreted broadly to cover modern technological advancements and to prevent computer-related crimes, including the misuse of personal devices.
- They also argued that a narrow interpretation of the statute would undermine its purpose and efficacy in combating computer-related offenses.

**Respondents:**
- The respondents argued that the statute should be interpreted narrowly to apply only to unauthorized access to a computer that belongs to someone else.
- They contended that the use of their own devices to transmit information did not constitute "obtaining access to a computer" as defined by the statute.
- They also argued that the prosecution had not proven the mens rea (dishonesty) necessary to establish the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

### 3. Legal Principles (Ratio Decidendi)

The key legal principle in this case is the interpretation of Section 161(1)(c) of the Crimes Ordinance, which criminalizes obtaining access to a computer with a view to dishonest gain. The Court of Final Appeal held that the statute does not apply to the use of one's own computer, unless that use involves accessing another computer.

**Textual Analysis:**
- The Court noted that the words "obtain" and "access" in the statute imply unauthorized use of a computer. The verb "obtain" suggests gaining something that one did not previously have, which is inconsistent with using one's own device.
- The removal of an interpretive provision during the legislative process, which would have defined "access" more broadly, further supports a narrow interpretation.

**Contextual Analysis:**
- The legislative history and purpose of the statute indicate that it was intended to address preparatory acts for substantive offenses, particularly those involving unauthorized access to someone else's computer.
- The statute was designed to fill a gap in the law where preparatory acts for computer-related crimes were not criminalized.

**Purpose and Public Policy:**
- The Court rejected the appellant's argument that a broad interpretation of the statute was necessary to address modern technological advancements and computer-related crimes.
- The Court emphasized that the function of statutory interpretation is to ascertain the purpose of the statute, not to create new offenses or advance a desirable public policy.

**Conclusion:**
- The Court held that the statute does not apply to the use of one's own computer, unless that use involves accessing another computer. Therefore, the appeal was dismissed.

### 4. Striking, Unusual, or Remarkable Aspects of the Case

1. **Interpretation of "Access" and "Obtain":** The case highlights the importance of precise language in statutory interpretation, particularly in the context of rapidly evolving technology. The Court's analysis of the words "obtain" and "access" demonstrates how the ordinary meaning of words can significantly impact the scope of a statute.

2. **Legislative Intent and Modern Technology:** The case raises questions about the adequacy of existing legislation in addressing modern technological challenges. The appellant's argument that the statute should be interpreted broadly to cover new forms of computer-related crime reflects the tension between legislative intent and the need for contemporary legal frameworks.

3. **Role of Statutory Interpretation:** The case underscores the role of the judiciary in interpreting statutes and the limits of judicial discretion in advancing public policy. The Court's rejection of the appellant's argument for a broad interpretation based on public policy highlights the importance of adhering to the text and purpose of the statute.

4. **Public Interest and Legal Lacunae:** The case highlights the potential public interest implications of narrow statutory interpretations, particularly in the context of computer-related crimes. The appellant's argument about the legal lacunae created by a narrow interpretation reflects the ongoing debate about the balance between legal certainty and the need for flexible legal frameworks to address emerging threats.

5. **Concession and Legal Precedent:** The case also demonstrates the significance of concessions made by parties in legal proceedings. The appellant's concession regarding the third respondent's use of the school computer, treating it as though it were her own, highlights the importance of such concessions in shaping the legal arguments and the Court's analysis. However, the Court explicitly stated that this concession does not create a precedent for future cases involving employer-provided computers. 

Overall, the case is remarkable for its detailed analysis of statutory interpretation in the context of computer-related crimes and its implications for the broader debate on the adequacy of existing legislation in addressing modern technological challenges. [end of text]
