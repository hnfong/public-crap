Q1: The number 120 has several interesting properties and connections to other areas of mathematics. Here are some examples:
- It is an abundant number, meaning that the sum of its proper divisors (factors excluding itself) is greater than the number itself. In this case, the sum of factors of 120 is 284, which is greater than 120.
- It is a highly composite number, having more divisors than any smaller number. In fact, it has 6 divisors: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 60.
- In base 10 arithmetic, when you multiply 120 by 10, the result is equal to adding a zero at the end of the number (e.g., 120 x 10 = 1200). This property also applies in other bases, such as base 5 and base 6.
- It has factors that are easy to work with, like prime factorization (2^3 * 3^1 * 5^1) or divisibility rules. For example, a number is divisible by 120 if it's divisible by both 4 and 3, meaning the last two digits must be divisible by 4 while the entire number must also be divisible by 3.
- It has connections to music theory as well, with intervals of fifth (a common interval in Western tonal harmony) being based on ratios that can be expressed using factors or multiples of 120, such as a perfect fifth representing a ratio of 3:2 and an octave being twice the frequency.
- In computer science, it is related to the number of possible comparisons when searching through an ordered list of length n in worst-case scenario (O(n log n) time complexity). If you have an array of size 120, then in the worst case, you could perform up to 7,680 comparisons.

Q2: To solve the equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use factoring or the quadratic formula. Here's how to do it using both methods:

Method 1: Factoring
We need to find two numbers whose product is -18 and their sum is -7. The pair of numbers that satisfies these conditions are -2 and 9. So, we can rewrite the equation as (x-2)(x+9) = 0. This means there are two possible solutions for x:
1. If (x-2)=0, then x=2.
2. If (x+9)=0, then x=-9.
So, the solutions to the equation are x=2 and x=-9.

Method 2: Quadratic Formula
The quadratic formula for solving an equation of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0 is:
x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)
For the given equation, a=1, b=-7, and c=-18. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:
x = [7 ± sqrt((-7)^2 - 4*1*(-18))] / (2*1)
x = [7 ± sqrt(49 + 72)] / 2
x = [7 ± sqrt(121)] / 2
x = [7 ± 11] / 2
This gives us two possible solutions: x=2 and x=-9, which match the results from factoring.

Q3: To find out how many round trips a train can make between two cities that are 200km apart within a full day (assuming an average speed of 60 km/h), we first need to calculate the time it takes for one trip:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours (approximately)
Since a full day has 24 hours, the number of round trips can be calculated as follows:
Number of round trips = Total time available in a day / Time for one trip
Number of round trips = 24 hours / 3.33 hours ≈ 7 (approximately)
So, the train can make approximately 7 round trips between the two cities within a full day at an average speed of 60 km/h and negligible time stationed in the cities.
