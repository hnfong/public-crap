 Q1: The number 120 is significant in various areas including mathematics, history, and culture. Some interesting properties of 120 are:
1. It is a highly composite number, meaning that it has more divisors than any other number with the same count of prime factors (120 has six divisors).
2. It is a part of some famous mathematical sequences like the Fibonacci sequence and the 8-gonal numbers (also known as octagonal numbers).
3. In history, 120 was considered a "perfect number" in ancient Babylonian mathematics, as it can be expressed as the sum of its proper divisors: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 40 + 60 = 120.
4. In some cultures, the number 120 is significant; for example, in ancient China, it was a symbol of longevity.

Q2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use the quadratic formula:
x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)
In this case, a = 1, b = -7, and c = -18.
x = (7 ± √((-7)^2 - 4 * 1 * -18)) / (2 * 1)
x = (7 ± √(49 + 72)) / 2
x = (7 ± √121) / 2
x = (7 ± 11) / 2
So, the two solutions are x = (7 + 11) / 2 = 9 and x = (7 - 11) / 2 = -2.

Q3: To determine how many round trips a train can make between two cities 200km apart while traveling at an average speed of 60 km/h within a full day, we need to find out how long it takes for the train to travel between the two cities and then calculate the number of trips possible in a day.
First, let's calculate the time it takes to travel between the two cities:
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 km / 60 km/h
Time = 3.33 hours (rounded)
Now, let's find out how many trips the train can make in a full day. A day consists of 24 hours, so we can calculate the number of round trips as follows:
Number of round trips = Total time available / Time per trip
Number of round trips = 24 hours / 3.33 hours/trip
Number of round trips = 7.21 (rounded to 7)
So, the train can make approximately 7 round trips between the two cities within a full day.
