Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

There are no specific inputs that will lead to the output "Done" for this program. The program only prints "Done" after the loop is finished, which means it will only print "Done" once, regardless of the input.

For example, if you enter "10" as the input, the program will print "Done" after the loop is finished, but it will not print "Done" again if you enter a different input.

Similarly, if you enter "0" as the input, the program will print "Done" after the loop is finished, but it will not print "Done" again if you enter a different input.

So, the output "Done" is not dependent on the input itself, but rather on the loop condition (x < math.inf). As long as the loop condition is met, the output "Done" will be printed once.
