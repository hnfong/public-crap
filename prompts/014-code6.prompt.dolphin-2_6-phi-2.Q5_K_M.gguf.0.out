Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

This program is designed to take an increment as input and keep adding it to a variable `x` until `x` becomes infinity (inf). It then prints "Done". 

The function `math.inf` in Python represents positive infinity. When you add this value to any other number, the result will always be more than that number. Therefore, if we start with `x = 0`, incrementing it by a positive number like `float(input("Enter a number"))` will never make `x` equal to `math.inf`. 

For example, let's consider the following inputs:

1. If the input is 2, the value of `x` after each iteration will be 0 (0 + 2), and it will print "Done" after one iteration. The reason for this output is that the loop condition `x < math.inf` is false after one iteration (0 < inf).
2. If the input is 5, the value of `x` after each iteration will be 0 (0 + 5), and it will print "Done" after two iterations. The reason for this output is that the loop condition `x < math.inf` is false after two iterations (0 + 5 > inf).

As you can see, these inputs lead to the output "Done". However, there are other inputs as well that can make the program print "Done" if you input a negative number or zero. For example, if you input -2, the value of `x` after each iteration will be 0 (0 + (-2)), and it will print "Done" after one iteration because the loop condition `x < math.inf` is still true (0 < inf).
