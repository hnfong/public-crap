 [/INST] Q1: 1+1=2
Q2: 6*7=42
Q3: 83*59=4877
Q4: 349*683=238017
Q5: 6043*7489=45367077
Q6: To solve the equation, first subtract 7 from both sides to get 3x = 15. Then divide both sides by 3 to get x = 5.
Q7: 25% of 80 is 20.
Q8: The shopkeeper should give you a $5 change because the total amount you gave was two $20 bills and one $5 bill, which adds up to $55, and the book only costed $15.
Q9: The perimeter of a square is 4 times its side length, so it would be 4*5 = 20 units.
Q10: Katherine and her two brothers and sister make for 4 children.
Q11: According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), first divide, then multiply and divide from left to right, and finally add and subtract from left to right. So the expression becomes 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.
Q12: Each person would need one slice, so five slices would be enough for all five guests.
Q13: To find the sale price, first calculate 20% of $25, which is $5. Then subtract that amount from the original price to get $25 - $5 = $20.
Q14: There are 180 minutes in 3 hours and 45 minutes, and 360 minutes in 6 hours, so there would be 360 - 180 = 180 minutes left until 6:30 PM.
Q15: Since a taxi can carry 4 passengers, you would need 22/4 = 5.5 taxis, but since you can't have half a taxi, you would need to round up to the nearest whole number, which is 6 taxis.
Q16: In a triangle, the sum of all three angles must be 180 degrees. Therefore, if two angles measure 31 and 62 degrees respectively, then the third angle must measure 180 - (31 + 62) = 87 degrees.
