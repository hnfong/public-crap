 

### Instruction:

Write a short story about that teaches the reader about the importance of love. Make sure the story includes these words: pillow, cloud, exaggerating


### Response:

One day a big fluffy pillow was sitting on a soft cloud. It was bored and wanted to play with something. Suddenly it saw a little cloud and thought that it would be funny to tell the little cloud that it was the biggest cloud in the sky. The little cloud didn't know any better and started to cry thinking it was bigger than all of the other clouds. 
The big pillow felt bad and told the little cloud that they were not actually bigger, but the little cloud believed them and went away happy. The big pillow then realized how much love there is in the world by just spreading a little bit of kindness. It started to exaggerate the size of all the clouds, saying "look at this huge cloud" and "that's the biggest one I've ever seen". Before long all the clouds were giggling and playing together. The big pillow learned that the most important thing in life is love.
