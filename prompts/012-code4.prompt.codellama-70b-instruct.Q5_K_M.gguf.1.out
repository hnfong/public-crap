  What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
  Source: assistant

 The provided Python code will never terminate and print an output as it enters an infinite loop. The while condition is always satisfied because x starts at 0.0 and is incremented by 1.0 each iteration, so x will never reach or exceed math.inf. Therefore, the program will run forever without printing any output. Source: assistant
