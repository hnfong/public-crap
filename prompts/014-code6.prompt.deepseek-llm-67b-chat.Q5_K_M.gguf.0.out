Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Yes, there are some inputs that can cause the program to print "Done". Here are two examples:

1) If you input a negative number as inc (e.g., -0.5), then on each iteration of the while loop, x will decrease in value until it reaches or goes below 0. At this point, since x < math.inf is no longer true, the program exits the loop and prints "Done".
2) If you input a positive number that's very close to zero (e.g., 10^-5), then each iteration of the while loop will only increase x by an extremely small amount. Because this increment is so small, it may take many iterations before x becomes sufficiently large such that x >= math.inf. At this point, since x < math.inf is no longer true, the program exits the loop and prints "Done".
