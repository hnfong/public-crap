The Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty (1661-1722) had many significant relationships and influential people during his reign. While there were several prominent figures in his life who could be considered close to him, I'll focus on some notable individuals from his early years that may have influenced him during his formative years.

1. Consort Concubine Cheng (长昶嫔) - Qianlong's primary consort and the mother of his first child, Emperor Yongzheng. Although not an official title like empress or concubine, her role in Qianlong's life would have been influential for a young emperor to witness. She played a significant role in the succession of the throne after Qianlong's death.
2. Grand Mistress Consort Gengxian (耿獻夫人) - The primary consort and mother of Qianlong's second child, Emperor Qianren. She was also known for her influence on Qianlong's reign, particularly in matters related to the arts and culture.
3. Lady Aisin-Gioro - The wife of Prince Yongchang (惟昌) and daughter of the first prince regent of the Qing Dynasty, Nurhaci. Lady Aisin-Gioro was also a direct descendant of the founder of the Manchu people, Nurhaci. She may have been involved in Qianlong's upbringing as she would have had connections to his ancestors.
4. Lady Nara - The wife of Prince Kangxi (康禧) and daughter of Prince Hongchang (洪昌), an older brother of Nurhaci. Lady Nara was also a descendant of Nurhaci through her mother. She would have been another significant figure in Qianlong's upbringing, being related to his father's side of the family.
5. Grand Duchess Consort Xianxian - The wife of Prince Dorgon (董邦) and daughter of the second prince regent of the Qing Dynasty, Hong Taiji. Although she didn't have a direct impact on Qianlong during his early years, her marriage to Prince Dorgon would have brought her influence into the palace after their son became the emperor.
6. Lady Nurhachi - A woman from the Nara clan who married the ninth prince regent of the Qing Dynasty, Yoto (懿烏). She was a first cousin of Qianlong's wife, Lady Aisin-Gioro. Lady Nurhachi's role in Qianlong's life could have been through her mother or aunt, and she may have played some part in his upbringing.
7. Lady Ju - The wife of Prince Yongchang (惟昌) and daughter of Prince Hongchun (洪春), another brother of Nurhaci. She would also be related to Qianlong through her husband, making her a significant figure in his early life.

While these relationships may not have directly shaped Qianlong's personality or values during his childhood, they undoubtedly had an impact on the environment and culture he grew up in. They exposed him to different traditions, customs, and people, which would have contributed to his understanding of the world. Moreover, these connections could also have influenced his decision-making later in life as the emperor.
