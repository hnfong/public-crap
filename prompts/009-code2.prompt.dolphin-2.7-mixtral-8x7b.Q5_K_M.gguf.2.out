Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

 To perform a binary search directly on a text file, you can use the same approach as a normal binary search but read specific portions of the file based on the current range. The function will open the file and seek to different positions within it depending on the current range of the binary search. If the target is found, its position in the file (in terms of lines) will be returned; otherwise, the insertion point will be returned.

Here's a Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        lines = [line.strip() for line in file]  # read all lines into a list

        left, right = 0, len(lines) - 1

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            mid_line = lines[mid]

            if target == mid_line:
                return mid
            elif target < mid_line:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1

        # If the target is not found, find the insertion point (bisect_left)
        if target < lines[mid]:
            return mid
        else:
            return mid + 1
```

This function opens the file and reads all its lines into a list. Then it performs a binary search on that list by seeking to different portions of the file depending on the current range, as explained before.

To use this function, simply call it with the path to the text file and the target:

```python
result = binary_search_file('names.txt', 'John')
print(result)
```

This will output the position of 'John' in the `names.txt` file or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").
