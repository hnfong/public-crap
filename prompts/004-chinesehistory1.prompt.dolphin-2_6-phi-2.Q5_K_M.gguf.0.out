In Chinese history, the early ancestors of the royal family are often referred to as "favorites" or "favorite sons." These were children born to emperors who wanted to ensure a secure line of succession and maintain their power. The title "favorite son" was given to these children based on their birth order, gender, or other factors that made them suitable for the throne.

The practice of designating favorite sons began in ancient China with Confucius' era (475-221 BCE), when the Xia Dynasty ruled over China. During this time, the first emperor, Emperor Shun, favored his third son, Yizhong, who was given the title "King of Qin." This practice continued through other dynasties such as the Shang, Zhou, and Han Dynasties.

In addition to being favored sons, these children were also given special treatment during their early years, including access to education, training in government affairs, and protection from political rivals. They often held important positions within the imperial court, which allowed them to gain influence and power.

However, this practice of favoritism could also backfire for the favorite sons. If they were not successful in securing the throne or if a more capable successor rose up against them, their favor would be lost, and they would likely face significant challenges in maintaining their status and power within the royal family.

Overall, the early ancestors of the royal family in Chinese history had children who were considered "favorite sons" due to various factors such as birth order, gender, or other attributes that made them suitable for the throne. These children received special treatment during their early years but faced potential challenges if they failed to secure the throne or if more capable successors emerged.
