Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

 To perform a binary search on a file directly without loading the entire file into memory, we need to use two pointers, one at the start of the file and another at the end. Then, read the middle element, compare it with the target value, and move either the left or right pointer according to whether the middle element is smaller or larger than the target value.

Here's a Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    try:
        file = open(file_path, 'r')
        left, right = 0, 0
        
        # Find the file size
        file.seek(0, os.SEEK_END)
        file_size = file.tell()
        
        while True:
            # Move to the middle of the file
            if left < right and right < file_size - 1:
                file.seek(right + (left - right) // 2)
                file.readline()
                right = file.tell() - 1
                line = file.readline().strip()
                
                # If target is found, return position
                if target == line:
                    return (right + left - 1) // 2
            
                # Move to the next element by skipping the current one
                file.seek(file_size - right, os.SEEK_CUR)
                right += len(line)
                
            # If target is not found, return insertion point (leftmost position where it should be inserted)
            else:
                return (right + left - 1) // 2
    finally:
        file.close()
```

This function reads the file line by line, moving the read pointer to the middle of the current range and checking whether the target value is found there or not. If it's found, the position is returned; otherwise, the search continues by updating the left or right pointer according to the comparison with the middle element.
