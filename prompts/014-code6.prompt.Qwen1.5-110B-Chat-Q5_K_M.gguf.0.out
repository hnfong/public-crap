Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

No, there is no input that will lead to the output "Done" in this program. The reason is that the while loop condition `x < math.inf` will always be true, as `math.inf` represents positive infinity, and `x` will keep increasing by the value of `inc` but will never reach infinity.

However, if you're looking for practical examples where the loop might terminate in a real-world scenario with finite numbers, you would need to modify the loop condition. Here are two examples of how you could modify the program to have a condition that would eventually be false:

Example 1: Loop a specific number of times:
```python
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number: "))
iterations = int(input("Enter the number of iterations: "))
while iterations > 0:
    x += inc
    iterations -= 1
print("Done")
```
Example 2: Stop at a specific value:
```python
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number: "))
target = float(input("Enter a target value: "))
while x < target:
    x += inc
    if x >= target:
        print("Done")
```
In the original context, as it stands, no input will result in the "Done" being printed because the loop attempts to iterate infinitely.
