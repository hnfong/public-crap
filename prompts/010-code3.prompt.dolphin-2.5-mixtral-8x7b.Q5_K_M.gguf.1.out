Consider the following python code:

```
def s(a):
    if len(a) <= 1: return a
    p = a[0]
    l = [x for x in a[1:] if x <= p]
    r = [x for x in a[1:] if x > p]
    return l + [p,] + r
```

What is its intended purpose? Then, please review the code, focusing on mistakes (if any), coding style, efficiency, and any other implementation details that may be of note. Finally, write a new function with all your suggested fixes/improvements, but in the Rust language (not in python).

 The intended purpose of this code is to sort a given list `a` using a method called "Quick Sort". In Quick Sort, an element is chosen as a pivot and all elements less than the pivot are moved to its left and all greater elements are moved to its right. Then the same process is applied recursively to each half until the entire list is sorted.

The code has some issues:
1. This implementation of Quick Sort does not handle duplicate values in a list properly, leading to some elements being skipped over entirely.
2. The function uses list comprehension twice for each partition, which could be less efficient than using a single loop.
3. The code does not contain any error handling or checks to ensure the input is a list of comparable values.

Here's an improved Python implementation:

```python
def quick_sort(a):
    if len(a) <= 1:
        return a

    pivot = a[0]
    l, r = [], []

    for x in a[1:]:
        if x < pivot:
            l.append(x)
        else:
            r.append(x)

    return quick_sort(l) + [pivot] + quick_sort(r)
```

Now, let's translate this to Rust language:

```rust
fn quick_sort<T>(a: Vec<T>) -> Vec<T>
where T: Ord {
    match a.len() {
        0..=1 => a,
        _ => {
            let pivot = a[0];
            let (l, r) = a[1..].partition(|x| x < &pivot);
            quick_sort(l.to_vec()) + vec![pivot] + quick_sort(r.to_vec())
        }
    }
}
```

Notes on the Rust version:
- Use of `partition()` method, which is more efficient than using a loop and appending values to separate vectors. This method partitions the slice in place and returns two iterators pointing to the start and end of the partitioned slice.
- Since `Vec<T>` implements the `Copy` trait for any type `T` that does, it's possible to concatenate multiple slices (or vectors) with the `+` operator. However, if we were sorting a large list or if the elements in our list were not trivially copyable, we might need to use a different approach, such as building up the result vector piece by piece using `push()`.
- Rust's strong static typing system means that we have to specify what type of elements our vector can contain. In this case, we use a generic function with a trait bound `T: Ord`, which indicates that `T` must implement the `Ord` trait, meaning that its values are comparable and can be sorted. This allows us to sort vectors of any type that implements this trait, such as integers or characters, but not floats or more complex data types without implementing ordering methods for them.
