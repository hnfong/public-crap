问题：历史中的秦始皇有甚么家人？他的童年过得开心吗？



### Response:

The Qin dynasty was the first imperial dynasty of China. It existed for 16 years from 221 BC until 207 BC. The first emperor of China was Qin Shi Huang who unified all other warring kingdoms in China at that time. He was born in 259 BC as Prince Ying, the youngest son of King Zhao of Qin. He had two elder brothers who died early. In his reign, he moved the capital city from Xianyang to Dadu (present-day Beijing). He also built a famous mausoleum called Terracotta Army in order to protect himself after death and become immortal.

Qin Shi Huang had several wives and concubines, as well as many children. His most important wife was Queen Xiaozhuang, who became empress dowager after his death. He also had 72 princesses and 300 consorts.

As a child, Qin Shi Huang lived in the capital city of Xianyang with his parents and elder brothers. He received the best education at that time, studied military tactics and strategy. When he was 15 years old, he became crown prince of Qin after his elder brother's death. In his 20s, he started to take power from his father and become emperor in fact even if not in name. After his father died, he declared himself emperor at the age of 30.

Qin Shi Huang was a very ambitious person. He wanted to unify China and build a powerful empire. He also wanted to protect himself after death. So he built Terracotta Army in order to have soldiers to guard him during his afterlife journey. He believed that if he had enough soldiers, he would be able to defeat the king of ghosts and become immortal.

Although Qin Shi Huang became emperor at a young age, he was not happy in his childhood. His father King Zhao was very cruel and demanded strict obedience from all members of the royal family, including Qin Shi Huang. He had to do everything according to his father's wishes. Even after he became emperor, he still remembered his unhappy childhood. So he built a beautiful palace in Dadu as his new home.
