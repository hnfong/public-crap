Q1: 1+1=2
Q2: 6*7=42
Q3: 83*59=5437
Q4: 349*683=2259273
Q5: 6043*7489=446191677
Q6: 3x + 7 = 22 => x = 5 (since 3 * 5 + 7 = 22)
Q7: 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20
Q8: The book costs $15, and you gave the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills, which adds up to 40 dollars. Since she did not have exact change, she gives you an additional 5-dollar bill, making your final change 35-dollar bill.
Q9: The perimeter of a square with side length 5 units is 4 * 5 = 20 units.
Q10: Katherine has two brothers and one sister, which makes a total of 3 children in her family. Her mother also has 2 children in her family, so the mother has 3 + 2 = 5 children.
Q11: The expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1 is 3 + 3 - 1 = 5.
Q12: Since there are 5 guests and each guest needs a slice of cake, they will need a total of 5 slices of birthday cake.
Q13: The original price of the shirt is $25, and it's on sale for 20% off. To find the sale price, we can subtract 20% of 25 from 25, which is (20/100) * 25 = 5 dollars. So the sale price is 25 - 5 = $20.
Q14: There are 60 minutes in an hour. If the clock shows 3:45 PM, then there are 60 * 3 + 45 = 225 minutes until 6:30 PM. However, since there are only 30 minutes left after 6:00 PM, we will subtract 30 from 225, which equals 195 minutes or 3 hours and 15 minutes left until 6:30 PM.
Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers. To find the number of taxis needed for a group of 22 people, we need to divide 22 by 4, which is 5.5. Since we cannot have half a taxi, we will round up to the nearest whole number, so the answer is 6 taxis are needed for a group of 22 people.
Q16: In a triangle, the sum of all three angles must be 180 degrees. The two given angles are 31 and 62 degrees. To find the third angle, we can subtract 31 + 62 from 180, which equals 77 degrees. So the measure of the third angle is 77 degrees.
