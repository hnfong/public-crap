Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

Answer 1: The number 120 has several interesting properties:

1. It is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120, which are all factors of 120.
2. It is a perfect square (12^2).
3. It can be expressed as the product of two prime numbers, 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 5.
4. It is a Harshad number in base 10, meaning it is divisible by the sum of its digits. Here, 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 12, and 120 is divisible by 12.
5. It is an abundant number, as the sum of its divisors is greater than the number itself (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 + 30 + 40 + 60 + 120 = 495).
6. It is a sphenic number, as it is the product of three distinct prime numbers (2, 3, and 5).
7. It has 120 unique divisors (including 1 and 120).

Answer 2:
To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can factor it as:

(x - 9)(x + 2) = 0

Now, we set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:

x - 9 = 0 => x = 9
x + 2 = 0 => x = -2

So, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

Answer 3:
To find the number of round trips the train can make within a full day, we need to determine how much time the train will take for each round trip and divide the total available time by this duration.

The distance between the two cities is 200 km, and the train's average speed is 60 km/h.

The time taken for one round trip would be:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 200 km / 60 km/h
Time = 3.33 hours (approximately)

There are 24 hours in a day, so the train can make:

Number of round trips = Total available time / Duration of one round trip
Number of round trips = 24 hours / 3.33 hours
Number of round trips â‰ˆ 7.3 (approximately)

Since the number of round trips must be a whole number, the train can make 7 round trips within a full day.

Note: In reality, the train may not be able to make a fraction of a round trip, so this calculation may not reflect the actual number of round trips the train can make in a day. Also, this calculation assumes that the train travels between the two cities continuously without stopping for an extended period. If the train needs to take breaks or stops, the number of round trips will be less.
