Answer for Q1:
To find the significance of the number 120, I will look at some interesting properties and facts about this number:

Step 1: Prime Factorization
120 = 2^3 * 3 * 5

Factors of 120 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120. The prime factors are 2, 3, and 5.

Step 2: Sum of Digits
Sum of the digits in 120 = 1 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 5

Factors that are divisible by 5 include 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 75, 80, 90, and 120.

Step 3: Multiples of Sum of Digits
Sum of the digits in 120 = 5 (also a factor)
Multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, 105, 110, 115, 120, 125, 130, 135, 140, 145, 150, 155, 160, 165, 170, 175, 180, 185, 190, 195, and 200.

Factors of 120 that are multiples of 5 include 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 60, 70, 75, 80, 90, 100, and 120.

Step 4: Special Numbers
Some special numbers related to 120 are 120^2 = 14400, 120^3 = 1728000, and 120^4 = 18144096. These properties of 120 make it an interesting number in mathematics.

Factors of 144 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 144. The prime factors are 2^4 and 3^2.

Factors of 1728 that include 144 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 144, 216, 288, 432, 576, 864, 1152, 1728.

Factors of 18144096 that include 1728 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 144, 216, 288, 432, 576, 864, 1152, 1728, 2304, 3528, 6912, 11592, 27648, 46752, 92304, 185376, 354832, 708864, 1214592, 2822496, 5644832.

Some properties of 120 are: it is a composite number, it has 14 factors (including 1 and itself), its prime factorization is 2^3 * 3 * 5, and it can be written as the sum of four consecutive primes (53 + 59 + 61 + 67).

The significance of the number 120 lies in its properties, which make it interesting for mathematicians to study. It's a composite number with 14 factors, prime factorization 2^3 * 3 * 5, and has several special numbers related to it.
