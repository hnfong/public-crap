Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

 To perform a binary search on a text file directly, we can use Python's built-in bisect module, which provides functions for performing binary searches. The `bisect_left` function from this module will give us the insertion point, as required in the problem statement. However, we need to first read and sort the lines of the text file before passing it to the `bisect_left` function.

Here is a Python function that reads the text file, sorts its lines, and then performs a binary search using the bisect module:

```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        lines = sorted(file.readlines())
    
    # Perform a binary search using the bisect module
    insertion_point = bisect.bisect_left(lines, target)
    
    return insertion_point
```

This function first reads all the lines from the file and sorts them. Then it uses `bisect_left` to find the position where the target should be inserted in the sorted list of lines. The function returns this position as an integer value, which can also be considered as the "insertion point" mentioned in the problem statement.

Please note that the time complexity for reading and sorting lines is O(nlog(n)), but once that's done, binary search operations will be O(log(n)).
