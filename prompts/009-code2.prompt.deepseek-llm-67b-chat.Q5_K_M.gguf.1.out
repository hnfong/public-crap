Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

To perform a binary search on a file directly and achieve O(log n) complexity, you need to read the file contents into memory as a list. You can then apply binary search algorithm on the sorted names in memory. The Python `bisect` module provides an implementation of binary search that we can utilize. Here's how you might implement this:
```python
import bisect
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path) as f:
        lines = [line.strip() for line in f]
    position = bisect.bisect_left(lines, target)
    if position != len(lines) and lines[position] == target:
        return position
    else:
        return -1  # or handle as insertion point, up to you
```
In this implementation, the `with open` statement is used for file handling. The list comprehension reads each line from the file into a list of strings (`lines`), stripping any leading/trailing whitespace. Then it uses `bisect_left` method which performs an efficient binary search and returns the insertion point where target should be inserted to maintain sorted order (if it's not found). If the position is not at end of lines and line at that position matches target, then return its index otherwise return -1 or handle as insertion point.

Note: This implementation assumes that the file fits into memory. If the file is too large, you might need a more complex solution like using mmap (memory-mapped files) for reading data directly from disk in chunks and applying binary search on those chunks.
