Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.
 [/INST]  Yo, listen up, my G, let me break it down
'Bout the Fed, the central bank that's really crowned
They got the power to make the money flow
And keep the economy movin', yo, don't you know?
They set the interest rates, like a boss,
Making sure the loans are cheap, and the economy's a boss
They gotta keep the inflation in check,
Or the money ain't worth the dough, you know what I'm sayin'?
They also regulate the banks, like a boss,
Making sure they don't get too fancy, or they'll get exposed
They gotta keep the economy stable,
So it don't collapse, like a building that's too frail
And they gotta keep an eye on the money supply,
Or the economy might get sickly, you feel me?
So the Fed is like the head honcho,
Making sure the economy's in the flow
They gotta keep it stable, and make it grow,
So we can all get that dough, yo!
Now, you might be thinking, "Why do they need a central bank?"
Well, think of it like this, my man, it's like a rank
They gotta keep the economy in check,
Like a G, so it don't get too hectic, you know what I'm sayin'?
So, in conclusion, the Fed plays a key role,
In keeping the economy on the right flow, yo!
So, next time you're counting your dough,
Just remember, the Fed's in charge, yo!
