Imagine there is a big group of people from all over your country, called London, and they gather together once a year. This meeting is like the most important birthday party for our city where everyone comes to share ideas and make decisions on how we want to live in this great city! 

Now imagine China as another country far away, and they also have their own big group of people called "China's National People Congress." They meet every year too, but it is much larger because there are so many more people living in China than just London. During these meetings, they make important decisions about how the whole country should work, like choosing new leaders and talking about laws that affect all Chinese people. So, both of our cities have this big meeting to help guide them on being better places for everyone!
