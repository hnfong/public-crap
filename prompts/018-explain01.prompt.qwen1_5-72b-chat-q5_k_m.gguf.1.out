Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

Yo, listen up, I got a lesson for ya,
'Bout a crew that runs the money game, no drama.
It's the Fed, short for Federal Reserve, you feel me?
They're like the OGs of the financial scene.

They control the cash flow, like they mixin' tracks,
Decidin' when to drop new bills, ain't no lack.
Like a DJ spin'in', they raisin' or lowerin' rates,
That's how they manage inflation, keep the economy straight.

If things get wild, they step in with a bailout plan,
 Bail out banks, stabilize the system, it's all part of their hand.
They're watchin' markets, like a hawk on the prowl,
Foreseein' trouble, preventin' crashes, they keep us from drownin'.

The Fed is independent, not owned by the prez,
But they still gotta report, give advice, nolez.
Money supply, interest rates, it's all on their plate,
They're like the conductor of the monetary symphony, can't be late.

So remember, next time you stack your Benjamins,
Think about the Fed, how they shape those greenamins'.
They keep the financial game smooth and bumpin',
The Federal Reserve, they runnin' things, no frontin'.
