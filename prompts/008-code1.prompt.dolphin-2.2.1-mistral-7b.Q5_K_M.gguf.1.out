Please write a python implementation of bubble sort. Then write a python implementation of merge sort. Discuss the two algorithms and compare them.

 Bubble Sort:
This algorithm is simple, but it's not very efficient for large lists. It works by repeatedly iterating through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The first pass will move the largest element to the end of the list, the second pass moves the second-largest to the next-to-last place, and so on.

Here is a Python implementation:

```python
def bubble_sort(lst):
    n = len(lst)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            if lst[j] > lst[j + 1]:
                lst[j], lst[j + 1] = lst[j + 1], lst[j]
```

Merge Sort:
This algorithm is much more efficient than bubble sort for large lists. It works by dividing the list into two halves, then recursively sorting each half until only one element remains in each half. These elements are then merged back together to form a sorted list.

Here is a Python implementation:

```python
def merge_sort(lst):
    if len(lst) <= 1:
        return lst

    mid = len(lst) // 2
    left_half = lst[:mid]
    right_half = lst[mid:]

    left_sorted = merge_sort(left_half)
    right_sorted = merge_sort(right_half)

    return merge(left_sorted, right_sorted)

def merge(left, right):
    result = []
    i = j = 0

    while i < len(left) and j < len(right):
        if left[i] < right[j]:
            result.append(left[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            result.append(right[j])
            j += 1

    result.extend(left[i:])
    result.extend(right[j:])

    return result
```

Comparison of Bubble Sort and Merge Sort:
Bubble sort is a simple, easy-to-implement algorithm that is suitable for small lists. However, it has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2), making it less efficient than other algorithms when dealing with large lists.

Merge sort, on the other hand, has a much better average and worst-case time complexity of O(n log n). It is a more complex algorithm that requires more memory for larger lists due to recursion. However, this is often not an issue since modern computers have plenty of memory available. Therefore, merge sort is typically recommended for sorting large lists in most cases.<|im_end|>
