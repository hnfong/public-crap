Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

Binary search is typically performed on a sorted array. However, to perform it directly on a text file without loading all data into memory, we can utilize the fact that each line in the file represents a sorted element. We need to read lines from the file as needed during the search process.

Here's a Python function `binary_search_file` that implements this approach:

```python
def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    def read_line_at_position(position):
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            for i, line in enumerate(f):
                if i == position:
                    return line.strip()
    
    left, right = 0, count_lines(file_path) - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        middle_line = read_line_at_position(mid)
        
        if middle_line == target:
            # The exact match is found
            return mid
        elif middle_line > target:
            # Target is smaller, search in the left half
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            # Target is larger, search in the right half
            left = mid + 1

    # No exact match found, return the insertion point (bisect_left)
    return mid

def count_lines(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        for i, _ in enumerate(f):
            pass
    return i + 1
```

This function first counts the number of lines in the file using `count_lines`, which also uses at most O(log(n)) operations by reading through the file once. Then, it performs binary search by repeatedly reading the middle line and comparing it with the target.

The time complexity of this approach is O(log(n)), as we're reducing the search space in half with each operation. However, note that if the file is very large, reading a line from disk at a specific position might take longer than log(n) time, which could affect the overall performance. In practice, it's often more efficient to load the entire sorted list into memory and perform binary search on it if possible.
