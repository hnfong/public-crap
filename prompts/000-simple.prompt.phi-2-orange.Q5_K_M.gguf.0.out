Q1: 1+1=2
Q2: 6*7=42
Q3: 83*59=4957
Q4: 349*683=2289983
Q5: 6043*7489=428376927
Q6: 3x + 7 = 22 => 3x = 15 => x = 5
Q7: 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20
Q8: I bought a book for $15, and I gave the shopkeeper two 20 dollar bills ($40 total), but she didn't have exact change so I gave her an additional 5 dollar bill. The final change should be $5 (the difference between what I paid and what the book cost).
Q9: A square has 4 equal sides, so if each side is 5 units long, then the perimeter is 4 * 5 = 20 units.
Q10: If Katherine has 2 brothers and 1 sister, that means her mother has 3 children in total (Katherine + brother + sister).
Q11: Evaluate the expression 3 + 12 รท 4 - 1 => 3 + 3 - 1 = 5
Q12: If 5 guests have arrived at Tom's birthday party, they would need at least one slice of cake per person. Since each cake usually has 8 slices, they would need 5 / 8 = 0.625 or approximately 1 slice of cake. However, since you cannot have a fraction of a slice, they would need to buy 1 whole slice of birthday cake.
Q13: If a shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off, the discount amount would be 20/100 * $25 = $5. So the sale price would be $25 - $5 = $20.
Q14: If it's 3:45 PM now, and 6:30 PM is 90 minutes later, then there are 90 minutes - 45 minutes (the time already passed) = 45 minutes left until 6:30 PM.
Q15: A taxi can carry 4 passengers at a time, so if there are 22 people in the group, we would need to find out how many taxis are needed by dividing 22 / 4. The result is 5 with a remainder of 2, which means that 5 taxis are enough for 16 people (4 * 5), and an additional 2 people will require another taxi. So, 6 taxis are needed in total.
Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, then the sum of these two angles is 31 + 62 = 93 degrees. Since the total sum of all three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, the measure of the third angle would be 180 - 93 = 87 degrees.
