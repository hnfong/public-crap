### Response:

Q1: The sum of 1 and 1 is 2.
Q2: The product of 6 and 7 is 42.
Q3: The product of 83 and 59 is 4907.
Q4: The product of 349 and 683 is 236217.
Q5: The product of 6043 and 7489 is 45,819,5813.
Q6: To solve the equation 3x +7 = 22, first subtract 7 from both sides to get 3x = 15. Then divide by 3 to find that x = 5. Therefore, the solution of the equation is x=5.
Q7: 20% (or 25 out of 100) of 80 is 20.
Q8: The shopkeeper has given Katherine 40 dollars in change for her book which costs $15. Therefore, she should give Katherine a change of 40-15 = $25.
Q9: The perimeter of a square with sides of 5 units is calculated by multiplying the side length by 4 (because a square has four equal sides). So, 5*4 = 20 units.
Q10: Katherine's mother must have 3 children because she has two brothers and a sister.
Q11: The result of the expression 3 + 12 * 4 - 1 can be calculated by following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS). First calculate the multiplication, then the addition from left to right, finally subtract. So, 3 + (12*4) - 1 = 35.
Q12: Tom's birthday party requires a slice of cake for each guest that arrives, so he needs 5 slices of cake in total.
Q13: A shirt originally costs $25 and is on sale for 20% off. This means the sale price is 80% of the original price which is calculated as 25*0.8 = $20.
Q14: If a clock shows 3:45 PM, there are 270 minutes left in an hour (60 min/hour * 4 hours). Therefore, there are 270 - ((3*60)+45) = 105 minutes until 6:30 PM.
Q15: To calculate how many taxis are needed for a group of 22 people who can all fit in one taxi (which is a capacity of 4 passengers), you would divide the total number of people by the capacity of each taxi, rounding up to the nearest whole number if necessary. So, 22 / 4 = 5.5 taxis are needed, which rounds up to 6 taxis.
Q16: If a triangle has two angles measuring 31 degrees and 62 degrees, the third angle is calculated by subtracting these from 180 (the total measure of a triangle's angles). So, 180 - 31 - 62 = 97 degrees.
Q17: The area of a circle with radius 5 units can be calculated using the formula π*r^2 where r is the radius and π (pi) is approximately equal to 3.14159. So, 3.14159*(5^2) = 78.53975 square units.
Q18: If a rectangle has length of 6 units and width of 7 units, its area can be calculated by multiplying the two lengths together (length*width). So, 6*7 = 42 square units.
Q19: A person who earns $500 per week wants to buy an item that is on sale for 30%. The cost of the item before the discount is the desired percentage (100%) divided by the given percent off (70%). So, the original price of the item is $500/0.7 = $714.29.
Q20: If a car travels 28 miles in 3 hours and 23 minutes, what was its average speed in mph? The formula for calculating average speed is distance divided by time (distance / time). But we need to convert the time from hours and minutes into decimal form, then express the distance in miles. So, (28/3.42) = 8.1579 miles per hour.
  
The answers are: 2, 42, 4907, 236217, 458195813, x=5, 20, 20, 20, 25, 5, 35, 20, 25, 5, 97, 78.53975, 42, and $714.29, respectively. The average speed is approximately 8.16 mph.
