Given a text file with lines that contain names sorted in lexicographical order. Discuss how to perform a binary search on the file directly, using at most O(log(n)) operations. Write a python function `def binary_search_file(file_path, target)` that returns the position of the target, or the insertion point (as in "bisect_left").

 To perform binary search on a text file, we can treat the file as an array and use a modified binary search algorithm to find the target. Here's how we can implement it in Python:

1. First, open the file and read its content into a list of strings.
2. Use a binary search algorithm that returns both the position where the target should be inserted (if not found) and the count of elements smaller than the target.
3. Close the file.

Here's an implementation using `bisect_left` function from Python's `bisect` module:

```python
import bisect

def binary_search_file(file_path, target):
    with open(file_path) as f:
        names = sorted([line.strip() for line in f])  # Read file content into list of strings
    
    return bisect.bisect_left(names, target), len(filter(lambda name: name < target, names))
```

This function reads the file contents into a list of sorted names, and then uses `bisect.bisect_left` to perform binary search on the list. The result is the position where the target should be inserted (if not found) and the count of elements smaller than the target.<|im_end|>
