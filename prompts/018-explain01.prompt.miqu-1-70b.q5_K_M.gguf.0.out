Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.


### Response:

Aight, listen up homie, I got a story to tell,
About the Fed, yeah, it's like the bank of banks, for real.
They control the money, make sure it flows right,
Keep the economy steady, even in a fright night.

Inflation too high? They cool it down slow,
Interest rates up, homie, that's the way they go.
But if things are looking weak, they pump some cash,
Lower those interest rates, give businesses a stash.

They also watch out for banks, make sure they don't fold,
Keep 'em in line, so our money stays gold.
And when the market's in crisis, they step up to save,
Bailouts and loans, to keep things on the wave.

So that's the Fed, yeah, they got the power,
Controlling our dollars, every single hour.
Keeping the economy lit, like a rapper's rhyme,
Without them, homie, it would be chaos time.
