Explain the role of the Federal Reserve to a rapper. Don't use complicated technical terms that the average rapper does not understand. Try to explain in slang and rap.

 Hey fam, listen up, this is some crucial knowledge you need to know!

The Federal Reserve plays a big role, like how it controls the money flow
It's like a bank for banks, yeah, that's right, it helps 'em stay on track

See, imagine if we had too much cash in circulation, prices would rise and inflation is the situation
But the Fed can step in to handle this mess, they raise interest rates, kinda like a stress test

Now if things get slow, economy ain't movin', then they lower that rate and watch us groovin'
See, they keep the balance just right, it's their job to make sure everything is tight

So yeah, next time you spit some rhymes about money, just remember the Fed, cuz it's all good when they're in the lead!
