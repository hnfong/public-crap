So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

**Grammar Mistakes:**

1. **Tense Inconsistency:** The text switches between past and present tense, making the narrative slightly disjointed. For example, "In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year..." followed by "My analysis back then was..." and "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023...". Consistency in recounting past events with a past tense would improve clarity.

2. **Subject-Verb Agreement:** "...whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG." Here, "buy" should agree in number with the plural "META and GOOG," suggesting "are" or breaking it into separate clauses for each company for clarity.

3. **Pronoun-Antecedent Agreement:** "I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking" is somewhat unclear due to the proximity of "tech workers" and the pronoun. It should be "I'm sure they are mostly diligent and hardworking."

4. **Word Form Agreem**ent**:** "...it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- **in particular META and GOOG."** Here, proper noun capitalization should be maintained for "META" and "GOOG," but also consider consistency in their representation throughout the text.

5. **Passive Voice Overuse:** "...it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down." This sentence could benefit from active voice for clarity and impact: "They can still squeeze significant profit from their monopolies before things break down."

**Serious Stylistic Issues:**

1. **Wordiness:** Sentences like "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations" could be condensed to "I was certain they could halve costs without impacting operations."

2. **Ambiguity:** "In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude" is ambiguous about what "this kind of predatory capitalist attitude" refers to, making the reason for not making trades unclear.

3. **Overuse of Parentheses:** The parentheses used in "...in particular META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG)..." and "...as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023,..." can disrupt the flow and clarity of the text. Consider integrating the additional information seamlessly into the sentence.

4. **Inconsistency in Punctuation:** The use of commas and periods varies, sometimes making it hard to distinguish between separate thoughts or clauses. For instance, the sentence about not making trades and the reason behind it could be separated for clarity.

5. **Redundancy:** "...there's actually no tech jobs here..." contains redundancy. "There are no tech jobs here" suffices without losing meaning.

**Other Problems:**

1. **Inequality in Treatment of Arguments:** The argument against the predatory capitalist attitude is quickly dismissed as an "ideological concern," which might not fully address the seriousness of the ethical considerations raised. Providing a balanced perspective on this ideological concern could strengthen the argument.

2. **Assumptions Without Evidence:** Statements like "I'm sure they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations" are made without supporting evidence, potentially weakening the argument's credibility.

3. **Overgeneralization:** The statement "every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another" overgeneralizes the experience of industries, ignoring the unique challenges and regulations faced by tech as compared to other sectors.

4. **Lack of Concrete Examples:** While the text references specific companies and events, it could benefit from more concrete examples to illustrate points, especially regarding the impact of layoffs and enshittification of products.

5. **Inconsistent Capitalization:** The inconsistent use of capitalization for "In the end," "I mean," and "People in more mature industries" can disrupt the formal tone of the text. Consistency in capitalizing new paragraphs or sentences following a period would improve readability.<|im_end|>
