Consider the following python code:

```
def s(a):
    if len(a) <= 1: return a
    p = a[0]
    l = [x for x in a[1:] if x <= p]
    r = [x for x in a[1:] if x > p]
    return l + [p,] + r
```

What is its intended purpose? Then, please review the code, focusing on mistakes (if any), coding style, efficiency, and any other implementation details that may be of note. Finally, write a new function with all your suggested fixes/improvements, but in the Rust language (not in python).

 The purpose of this code is to generate a list of substrings of a given string where each substring is at most one character long and the length of the substring does not exceed 1. The function works by iterating over the string, extracting the first character, then recursively traversing the remaining characters to find possible substrings ending at that character.

The main issues in this code:
- It uses a list comprehension and Python's `len` function which can be quite slow in larger strings.
- The function does not handle duplicate substrings properly, i.e., it may generate multiple different substrings for the same input string.

Here is the corrected code, using Rust instead of python:

```rust
use std::collections::HashSet;

fn s(s: &str) -> Vec<String> {
    // First we create a HashSet to ignore duplicate substrings
    let mut set = HashSet::new();

    for i in 0..=s.len() - 1 {
        if s[i] <= 'a' && s[i] >= 'z' {
            set.insert(String::from(&s[..i + 1].to_ascii_lowercase()));
        }
    }

    let mut result = Vec::new();
    
    for substring in &set {
        result.extend(s.split(substring).map(|x| x.clone()).collect());
    }

    result // Now we return the list of substrings
}
```

This function uses a hash set to ignore duplicate substrings and returns the list of substrings based on the criteria provided in the question. The time complexity for this solution is O(N * Î£(n)), where N is the length of the input string and the number of distinct substrings of length n. This makes it efficient enough for most use cases.<|im_end|>
