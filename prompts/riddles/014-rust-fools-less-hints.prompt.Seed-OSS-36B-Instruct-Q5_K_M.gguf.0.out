Got it, let's try to figure out when this passage was written. First, I need to pick out all the clues from the text and then cross-reference them with real-world events or timelines for Rust, C++, and the projects mentioned.

Starting with the C++ parts: The author mentions C++20 features, specifically modules, which were standardized in C++20. When did C++20 get finalized? I remember C++20 was published in December 2020. Then they talk about C++26 features: stackful coroutines, embedding binary files, safe range-based for loops. C++23 was released in December 2022, so C++26 would be the next one after that, but the author is looking forward to C++26, so they must be writing after C++20 is out but before C++26 is finalized (which is 2026, but the author is talking about "looking forward" to it, so maybe not too far ahead of 2023-2024?).

Then there's cppfront: Herb Sutter's cppfront was announced in 2022, right? Let me check—yes, Herb Sutter presented cppfront at CppCon 2022, so that's a 2022 event. The author mentions "as proposed by Herb Sutter cppfront"—so they need to have heard of cppfront, which is post-2022.

Carbon language: Google announced Carbon in September 2022, so that's another 2022 clue. The author mentions "the new C++ compatible Carbon language"—so again, post-2022 because Carbon was announced then.

Now Rust parts: The author talks about Rust's edition mechanism and recent features. They mention "generic associated types (GATs)" having landed—when did GATs stabilize? GATs were stabilized in Rust 1.65, which was released in March 2022. Then "forthcoming 'type alias impl trait'"—type alias impl trait (TAIT) was stabilized in Rust 1.75, which is December 2023, but wait, the author says "forthcoming," so if they're writing when TAIT is forthcoming, that would be before 2023? Wait, but let's check: GATs stabilized in March 2022, so if the author is talking about GATs as "recently landed features," that would be after March 2022. Then TAIT—if it's "forthcoming" when they write, that would be before its stabilization in 2023.

Also, the author mentions "async has been a major effort"—async in Rust has had stable async/await since Rust 1.39 (September 2019), but maybe they're referring to ongoing work, but that's less specific.

The build system part: They mention Bazel integration, which has been around, but the main point is Cargo as near-monoculture—has that changed? Maybe not, but not as helpful.

Community comments: The author mentions Rust community being "extremely imperious"—I remember around 2022-2023 there were some discussions in the Rust community about tone, maybe that's a contemporary complaint. Also, they mention "Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust"—that's a common call-to-action, but not date-specific.

Linebender projects: Linebender is the organization behind piet, druid, etc. I should check if Linebender announced a C++ rewrite around any time. Let me think—do I recall Linebender moving to C++? A quick mental check: Linebender's projects are mostly Rust, but if the author is writing a post about switching, when would that be? Let me see, if the author is looking for help on Zulip, and mentions Carbon (2022) and cppfront (2022), that's a key.

Also, C++20 modules: the author says "C++20 brings us modules, an innovative new feature, and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon." Wait, when were modules implemented in major compilers? GCC supported C++20 modules experimentally in 11, but widely supported? Maybe by 2023, but the author is saying they're looking forward to modules being implemented "fairly soon" after C++20 was released (2020). So if they're writing in 2022-2023, modules might still be in the process of being fully implemented in compilers they use.

Another point: the author mentions "the Rust community can be extremely imperious, constantly demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust"—this sentiment has been around, but I think it gained more traction in discussions around 2022, maybe in response to some Rust advocacy. Also, the part about "code of conduct and other policies promoting diversity"—there were some controversies in tech communities around DEI policies in 2022-2023, which might align with the author's view that "programming languages should be free of politics."

Carbon language was announced in Sept 2022, cppfront in Oct 2022 (CppCon 2022 is Oct). So the author must be writing after both of those announcements, because they mention both. So that's post-Sept 2022.

Now, Rust features: GATs stabilized March 2022, so "recently landed features such as generic associated types"—if they're writing after that, which they are (post-2022). TAIT was stabilized in Dec 2023, so if the author calls it "forthcoming," that would mean they're writing before Dec 2023. So between Sept 2022 and Dec 2023.

Is there any other clue? The author mentions "the Linebender projects"—let me check if there's any public post from Linebender about switching to C++. A quick search in my memory: I don't recall Linebender actually doing a full C++ rewrite, but maybe the author is hypothesizing or planning. Alternatively, maybe this is a fictional or hypothetical post, but we have to go by the clues.

Another angle: C++26 features—when were those proposed? The author lists "stackful coroutines"—C++26 is scheduled for 2026, so the features they mention for C++26 would be in the proposal stages around 2022-2024. For example, stackful coroutines (P2300) was voted into C++26 in 2023, I think. So if the author is talking about C++26 features "to look forward to," that's consistent with 2022-2024.

Also, the author says "C++ has even more exciting changes to look forward to, including potentially a new syntax as proposed by Herb Sutter cppfront, and even the new C++ compatible Carbon language." Both cppfront and Carbon are 2022 announcements, so the author is writing after those, so late 2022 or early 2023.

Is there anything about Rust's edition mechanism? The author says "Rust is held back by its commitment to not break existing code (enacted by the edition mechanism), while C++ is free to implement backwards compatibility breaking changes in each new version." Rust editions are every few years—Edition 2021 was released in October 2021, Edition 2024 is planned for 2024. The author isn't mentioning a new edition, but just the mechanism in general, so not super helpful.

Community: The author mentions "/r/rust"—that subreddit exists, but the comment about "well known for their sense of humor"—the C++ subreddit (r/cpp) has a reputation for memes and humor, which is long-standing, but the author is contrasting it with Rust's community, which might be a contemporary complaint.

Putting it all together: The earliest possible date is after Carbon (Sept 2022) and cppfront (Oct 2022) announcements. The latest possible is before TAIT stabilizes (Dec 2023), but more likely, since the author is talking about C++20 modules being "implemented fairly soon"—by 2023, modules are more widely supported, but maybe the author is writing in late 2022 or early 2023.

Wait, another check: Herb Sutter's cppfront—when was it first public? The first public demo was at CppCon 2022 in October 2022. Carbon was announced at Google I/O 2022 in September 2022. So the author must have written after both, so October 2022 at the earliest.

Is there any mention of Rust versions that can help? The author says "recently landed features such as generic associated types"—GATs were stabilized in Rust 1.65 (March 2022), so if they're writing after that, which they are. The next feature is "type alias impl trait" which was stabilized in 1.75 (Dec 2023), so if it's "forthcoming" when written, that's before Dec 2023.

Also, the author mentions "async has been a major effort"—async in Rust has had stable async/await since 1.39 (2019), but maybe they're referring to things like async fn in traits, which are still unstable (as of 2024), but the author doesn't mention that.
