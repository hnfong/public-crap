Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the clerk told the woman to cover the crystal ball when she leaves the house. The woman asked if it's because of spirits, and the clerk just said, "Exactly." Hmm, that's interesting. Let me break this down.

First, I know that crystal balls are often associated with fortune-telling and the supernatural. People use them in movies and stories to see into the future or communicate with spirits. So, maybe the clerk is implying that the crystal ball has some magical properties. If that's the case, covering it might prevent something from happening when she's not around.

Wait, but why would she need to cover it when she leaves? Maybe it's to prevent spirits from being attracted to it. If the crystal ball is a medium for spirits, leaving it uncovered might allow them to come through or cause some kind of trouble. So, by covering it, she's blocking that access.

Another angle could be that the crystal ball might reveal things when no one is around. Maybe it shows visions or something, and covering it would prevent those visions from being seen by others or from happening unsupervised. But the clerk mentioned spirits, so it's more likely related to preventing spirits from using it.

I've also heard that in some traditions, certain objects like mirrors or crystals can act as portals or gateways. So, covering the crystal ball might be a way to close that portal when not in use, preventing any unwanted entities from coming through.

So, putting it all together, the clerk is probably warning her that the crystal ball can attract spirits, and covering it when she's not there stops them from causing any issues or manifesting. That makes sense because the woman immediately thought of spirits, so the clerk confirmed it.

The clerk advised the woman to cover the crystal ball when she leaves to prevent spirits from being attracted to it or using it as a portal. Covering it acts as a protective measure, blocking access and preventing any supernatural activity when she's not present. [end of text]
