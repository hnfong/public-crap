Okay, the user is asking about a World of Warcraft classic riddle regarding warlock pet choices. They want to know why voidwalkers are more commonly seen than succubi despite succubi being better for leveling, with a hint about a succubus skill making them more common than perceived.

Hmm, this is actually a clever play on perception. The key here is the succubus's Seduction ability. In classic WoW, when a succubus uses Seduction on an enemy, it turns the mob into a harmless NPC for a short duration. During this time, the succubus model disappears from view because the game treats it as the mob being "controlled" rather than the pet being present.

Ah! So players aren't actually seeing fewer succubi - they're just invisible during Seduction casts. The voidwalker remains visible constantly as a tank, creating the illusion that voidwalkers are more common. The riddle tricks you into thinking about combat utility when the real answer is about visual perception mechanics.

The user seems knowledgeable about WoW mechanics - probably a veteran player testing obscure knowledge. They want a concise answer, so I'll skip explaining Seduction's mechanics and just state the core illusion. No need for fluff since they specified "concisely". 

Better double-check: yes, in classic WoW the succubus model does vanish during Seduction. Modern versions changed this, but the question specifies classic. Perfect - the answer holds.

Succubi frequently vanish during combat due to their **Seduction** ability (turning mobs into harmless NPCs), making them *appear* less common than voidwalkersâ€”though they're actually used just as often. The voidwalker's constant visibility creates the illusion of higher prevalence. [end of text]
