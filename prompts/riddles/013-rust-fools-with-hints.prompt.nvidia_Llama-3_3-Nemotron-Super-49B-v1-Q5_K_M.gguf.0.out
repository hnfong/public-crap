**Best Guess Date:** April 1, 2023

**Explanation and Use of Hint:**

The hint mentions a "distinctive writing style... connected to one particular day and month of the year." This is a subtle nudge towards considering April 1st, a day known for April Fool's Day, where humorous, satirical, or misleading content is common. Hereâ€™s how the passage's characteristics align with this interpretation:

1. **Controversial and Contrarian Views**:
   - The author expresses a shift from Rust to C++ for reasons that might raise eyebrows in the developer community (e.g., downplaying memory safety concerns, preferring C++'s evolution pace over Rust's stability).
   - These views are presented in a somewhat provocative manner, characteristic of April Fool's content.

2. **Tone and Language**:
   - The confidence in avoiding safety issues due to personal skill ("I consider myself a good enough programmer") and the dismissal of community aspects (e.g., code of conduct for diversity) might be seen as tongue-in-cheek or exaggerated for effect.
   - The mention of "excellent leadership" in the C++ community, specifically highlighting a paper by Stroustrup without critiquing its content, and the anticipation of a "new syntax" without skepticism, further suggest a lighthearted or satirical approach.

3. **Specific Technical References**:
   - **C++ Versions and Features**: Mention of C++20, anticipation of C++26 features (stackful coroutines, safe range-based for loop), and the reference to "cppfront" and "Carbon language" are technically plausible but presented in a future-looking manner that might be exaggerated for the sake of the argument.
   - **Rust's Pace of Innovation**: The characterization of Rust's recent feature additions as not "fundamentally new" could be a subjective critique but is framed in a way that might not fully reflect the broader community's view, adding to the suspiciously opinionated tone.

4. **Call to Action and Platforms Mentioned**:
   - The casual invitation to join a Zulip instance for a "C++ rewrite" and the suggestion to discuss on Hacker News and `/r/rust` (potentially expecting a strong reaction) are consistent with setting up a platform for a reveal or a joke's payoff.

**Why Not Another Date?**

- **No Direct Time-Specific References**: There are no explicit mentions of events, releases, or announcements that would pinpoint a specific year or month beyond the general references to language standards (C++20, anticipated C++26).
- **Style Over Substance**: The emphasis on the author's personal preferences and the provocative nature of the arguments suggest a piece designed to elicit a reaction rather than a serious technical discussion, aligning with April Fool's Day content.

**Caveat**: Without explicit confirmation, this guess relies on interpreting the tone and style as indicative of an April Fool's piece. If the article is indeed serious, the date would be more challenging to determine precisely without additional context, potentially falling within a broad range (2022-2023) based on the C++ and Rust references. However, given the hint, April 1st is a compelling interpretation. [end of text]
