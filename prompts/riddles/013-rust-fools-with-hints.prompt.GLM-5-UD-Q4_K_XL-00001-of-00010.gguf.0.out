Based on the distinctive writing style and the content of the passage, my best guess is that this was written on **April 1st (April Fools' Day)**.

While the specific year is harder to pin down without external context, the date **April 1st** is the critical element suggested by the hint. It could be any recent year (e.g., 2023 or 2024) where Rust and C++ were active topics of debate.

### How the hint is utilized:

The hint points to the "distinctive writing style" connected to a specific day. The passage is a masterclass in **"deadpan satire"** or **"poe's law"** in action—writing that mimics a serious, sincere tone while advancing arguments that are logically inverted or comically absurd. This style is the hallmark of high-quality **April Fools' Day** posts in the tech industry.

Here is how the text uses this "April 1st" style:

1.  **The "Straight Man" Delivery:** The author adopts a tone of reasoned, mature reflection ("I’ve been involved in Rust... for many years," "I have found my frustrations... growing"). The humor relies on the gap between this serious tone and the ridiculousness of the assertions being made.
2.  **Inversion of Consensus:** The author takes widely accepted truths in the software community and confidently states the opposite as if it were a revelation.
    *   *Build Systems:* The Rust community generally praises Cargo for being ergonomic and solving "dependency hell." The author frames this unified ecosystem as a "limiting... monoculture" and nostalgically praises the C++ landscape of CMake, Autotools, and Make—a notorious pain point for C++ developers—as "choice."
    *   *Safety:* The author dismisses memory safety, a primary selling point of Rust, by claiming, "I consider myself a good enough programmer that I can avoid writing code with safety problems." This is a classic "April Fools" trope: the arrogant overconfidence that validates the very problem the tool was designed to solve.
    *   *Community:* The author claims the C++ subreddit is "well known for their sense of humor" (implying the Rust community is not), while the entire article itself is a elaborate joke posted to that very community or similar forums.
3.  **Absurd Specificity:** The mention of compiling for "AIX and DEC OSF/1 AXP" (obscure, legacy Unix systems) in a discussion about modern GUI toolkits is a comedic exaggeration meant to signal to the reader that the author is not being serious.
4.  **The "Tell":** The section on "Language evolution" claims that C++ is "free to implement backwards compatibility breaking changes," which is the exact opposite of C++'s defining philosophy (it is notorious for never breaking backwards compatibility). This factual inversion serves as a "wink" to the reader, confirming the satirical intent.

Because the text is a carefully constructed joke designed to look like a serious technical blog post until the reader realizes the absurdity, it is almost certainly written for **April 1st**. [end of text]
