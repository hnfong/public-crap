Based on the content of the passage, it appears to have been written sometime in the late 2020s or early 2030s. Here are the reasons for this estimation:

1. **Rust's Evolution**: The author mentions that the pace of innovation in Rust has become more sedate, and cites the recent landing of features like generic associated types. These features were introduced in Rust 1.45.0, released in March 2020, and the author's perspective suggests a period after this, where the community has had time to reflect on the pace of change.

2. **C++20 Features**: The author looks forward to the implementation of C++20 features, such as modules, which were standardized in December 2019. The mention of looking forward to these features being implemented "fairly soon" suggests a time shortly after the standardization but before widespread adoption, which would place the writing in the early 2020s or slightly later.

3. **Future C++ Features**: The author mentions looking forward to C++26 features, which suggests a time frame after C++20 had been released and discussions about future standards were underway. The C++26 standard is expected to be released around 2026, so mentioning it implies a writing date close to or after 2020 but before the features are finalized and widely discussed.

4. **Social Media and Community Dynamics**: The author's commentary on the Rust community's behavior on social media and the perceived imperiousness suggests a period where Rust's popularity and community dynamics have been well-established and observed over time. This observation aligns with a period after Rust's growth in popularity, which peaked in the mid-2020s according to various developer surveys and community discussions.

5. **Political and Social Context**: The author's stance on the Rust community's code of conduct and diversity policies reflects a nuanced understanding of ongoing debates within tech communities about inclusivity and representation. This suggests a period where these discussions have been ongoing and have reached a point where they are referenced in a somewhat dismissive manner by the author, which aligns with the late 2020s when these topics were increasingly prominent in tech discourse.

Given these points, a reasonable estimate for when this passage was written would be sometime between 2022 and 2025. This period allows for the reflection on Rust's evolution post-C++20 standardization, the anticipation of future C++ standards, and the maturation of community dynamics and social issues within the tech community.
