Hmm, this is an interesting passage that requires careful analysis to determine its likely date of writing. The author discusses transitioning from Rust to C++ for GUI toolkit development, with specific references to language features, community dynamics, and build systems.

First, I need to identify key temporal markers. The mention of C++26 suggests the author is looking beyond C++20/23, placing this after C++20's release (2020) but before C++26's finalization. The reference to "cppfront" (Herb Sutter's experimental syntax project) and Carbon language points to post-2022 discussions. The critique of Rust's "sedate" innovation pace and mention of generic associated types (GATs) and "type alias impl trait" (TAIT) are telling—GATs stabilized in Rust 1.65 (late 2022), and TAIT discussions peaked around 2022-2023.

The community commentary is also revealing. The author complains about Rust's "imperious" community and dismisses diversity efforts, which aligns with heated online debates circa 2021-2023, particularly around Rust's Code of Conduct controversies. The call to discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust suggests a contemporary online discourse context.

The build system discussion mentions CMake and Meson as current options, with Bazel for polyglot projects—all relevant in the early 2020s. The Linebender project name doesn't ring a bell as a major existing initiative, so it might be fictional or niche.

Putting it together: C++20 is recent (2020), C++26 is speculative (targeting 2026), Rust's GATs/TAIT are mid-2020s topics, and the community tensions peaked post-2021. The tone feels like a 2022-2023 opinion piece, possibly from a developer disillusioned with Rust's trajectory. The "Zulip instance" mention also fits early 2020s tooling trends.

I'd estimate mid-to-late 2022, with early 2023 as a possibility if referencing very recent Rust debates. The lack of C++23 mentions (released 2023) is notable—maybe written before its finalization. So, likely 2022.
</think>
Based on the content and references within the passage, the most likely date of writing is **mid-to-late 2022**, with early 2023 as a secondary possibility.

Here’s the reasoning:

1. **C++ Language Timeline**:
   - The author references **C++20** as a recent release (which officially published in December 2020) and looks forward to **C++26** (targeting ~2026). This suggests the text was written after C++20’s stabilization but before C++23’s finalization (C++23 published in late 2023). The mention of “modules” in C++20 as “innovative” and “being implemented fairly soon” aligns with the period when compilers were still fully rolling out support (2021–2022).
   - References to **Herb Sutter’s cppfront** (announced in 2022) and the **Carbon language** (first publicly discussed in mid-2022) are strong temporal anchors. These were hot topics in the C++ community in 2022.

2. **Rust Language & Ecosystem**:
   - The author critiques Rust’s pace of innovation, specifically naming **generic associated types (GATs)** and **“type alias impl trait” (TAIT)** as recent, incremental features. GATs stabilized in **Rust 1.65 (late 2022)**, and TAIT was a major discussion item in 2022–2023 (eventually stabilized in Rust 1.71 in 2023). The phrasing “recently landed” for GATs points to late 2022 or early 2023.
   - The mention of Rust’s **edition mechanism** (2018, 2021) as a constraint on breaking changes fits the post-2021 edition context.

3. **Community & Cultural Context**:
   - The author complains about the Rust community being “imperious” and dismissive of diversity/politics in language communities. This mirrors heated online debates in **2021–2022**, particularly around Rust’s Code of Conduct, “Rust evangelism” backlash, and culture-war adjacent discussions in tech spaces.
   - The specific call to “Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust” suggests a contemporary (post-2015) online discourse style, but the tone aligns with peak “Rust vs. C++” flamewars of 2021–2022.

4. **Build Systems & Tooling**:
   - The discussion of **CMake, Meson, Bazel** as current options, and the note that other systems “will be created on a regular basis,” reflects the state of C++ build tooling circa 2020–2022. No mention of newer trends like **Premake5** or **Bazel’s** evolving Rust support might hint at an earlier side of this window.

5. **Absence of Later Developments**:
   - No mention of **C++23** features (e.g., `std::expected`, `std::generator`, `static operator<=>`), which were finalized in 2023. If written after late 2023, one might expect a nod to C++23.
   - No reference to **Rust’s 2024 edition** planning (which began in 2023) or **Carbon’s** more recent updates (2023–2024).
   - The tone of “C++ is evolving to become safer” without citing specific C++23 safety proposals (like the “safety” TS) suggests pre-2023.

6. **Project Name “Linebender”**:
   - “Linebender” appears to be a fictional or niche project name (no major known GUI toolkit by that name as of 2024). This doesn’t provide a firm date but fits the pattern of a personal/opinion piece about a hypothetical rewrite.

**Conclusion**: The convergence of **cppfront/Carbon mentions (2022)**, **GATs stabilization (late 2022)**, and the cultural critique style points strongly to **late 2022**. If the author was referencing very recent Rust changes (GATs just stabilized), it could be early 2023, but the absence of C++23 references makes late 2022 the tighter fit.

**Best guess: October–December 2022**. [end of text]
