Based on the passage and the hint about a distinctive writing style connected to a particular day and month, my best guess is that this was written in **April 2023**.

### Reasoning and Use of the Hint

Let's break down the clues and reasoning:

#### 1. **Reference to "Linebender projects" and "GUI toolkits in Rust"**
The author discusses their long involvement with Rust and GUI infrastructure. This suggests the author has been active in the Rust ecosystem for several years. Given that Rust 1.0 was released in 2015, and the rapid early growth of the ecosystem, the author's "many years" involvement likely started around 2016-2017 or earlier.

#### 2. **Mentions of C++20 and C++26 features**
The passage specifically mentions C++20 features (modules) and looks forward to C++26 features (stackful coroutines, embedded binary data, safe range-based for loop). C++20 was published in December 2020, and C++26 is the next standard after C++23 (published December 2023), so C++26 would be expected around late 2025 or 2026. However, the passage treats C++26 as "forthcoming," suggesting it's not yet released or even in draft form. As of early 2023, C++26 was still in the committee's pipeline, not yet published.

#### 3. **Rust's recent features and innovation pace**
The author notes that Rust's recent features (e.g., GATs, type alias impl trait) are more about "making combinations of existing features work as expected" rather than fundamental innovation, and contrasts this with C++'s rapid evolution. This suggests the author is commenting on the state of Rust as of 2022-2023, after the stabilization of async and other major features.

#### 4. **Reference to "cppfront" and "Carbon language"**
The mention of Herb Sutter's cppfront (a C++-to-C++20 transpiler) and the "new C++ compatible Carbon language" is telling. Carbon was announced by Google in July 2022. If the author is referencing Carbon as a "new" language, it's likely after that announcement but before it gained much traction, i.e., late 2022 or early 2023.

#### 5. **The Hint: Distinctive Writing Style Connected to a Day and Month**
The passage has a reflective, almost elegiac tone, with phrases like "Rust was a good experiment," "time to take ... to a mature, production-ready language," and a sense of moving on from one phase to another. This is reminiscent of an "April Fools' Day" announcement, where people sometimes write tongue-in-cheek or satirical posts about switching languages, communities, or paradigms.

Additionally, the passage ends with a call to action to join a Zulip instance and links to Hacker News and /r/rust for discussion—something that's common in April Fools' posts or meta-community announcements.

But more specifically, the style—mixing technical detail with a bit of humor (e.g., "the C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor") and a sense of finality—matches the tone of some April 1st posts in programming communities, where people "declare" the end of one era and the beginning of another, often in a playful way.

#### 6. **Community and Politics References**
The author's comments about the Rust community being "imperious" and "extremely imperious," and the C++ community being "nicer and friendlier," echo the kind of exaggerated, tongue-in-cheek comparisons often found in April Fools' posts.

#### 7. **Specific Month Clue**
April is known for pranks and meta-commentary in tech communities. The passage's slightly dramatic but lighthearted tone, the references to community drama, and the sense of moving on to a "mature" language all fit the style of an April 1st announcement.

#### 8. **Concrete Date Guess**
Given the references to C++20 and C++26 (not yet released), and the mention of Carbon (announced July 2022), the most plausible window is **April 2023**. This is after Carbon's announcement, after C++20 has been published, but before C++26 is finalized, and before Rust's ecosystem has settled into a slower cadence.

### Conclusion

**Best guess: April 1, 2023 (April Fools' Day)**

The passage's playful tone, exaggerated community descriptions, and the timing of language and tooling references all point to an April 1st announcement, likely satirizing the ongoing debates between Rust and C++ communities.

**How the hint is used:**  
The distinctive style—mixing technical detail with humor, a sense of finality, and community commentary—matches the tradition of April Fools' Day posts in programming communities. The references to recent language developments and the timing of those developments further support an April 2023 date. [end of text]
