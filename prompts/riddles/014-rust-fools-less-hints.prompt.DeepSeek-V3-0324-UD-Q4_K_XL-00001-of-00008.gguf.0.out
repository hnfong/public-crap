To estimate the date this passage was written, let's analyze the key clues in the text:

1. **C++20 and C++26 references**:  
   - C++20 was officially published in December 2020.  
   - The author mentions C++26 as a future version, which suggests this was written before C++23 (the next standard after C++20) was finalized (C++23 was published in December 2023).  
   - The author also mentions C++20 modules as "an innovative new feature" that they're "looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon," implying this was written when compiler support for modules was still spotty (early-to-mid 2020s).

2. **Rust's "forthcoming 'type alias impl trait'"**:  
   - Type alias impl trait (TAIT) was stabilized in Rust 1.65.0 (released November 2022) but was in active discussion and partial implementation for years prior. The phrasing suggests it was not yet stable when this was written.

3. **Carbon language mention**:  
   - Carbon was announced by Google in July 2022, so this passage must post-date that.

4. **Linebender projects**:  
   - The Linebender organization (focused on Rust GUI tools like druid) was active in 2022–2023, with some members publicly expressing frustration with Rust around that time.

5. **Herb Sutter's cppfront**:  
   - cppfront (a C++ syntax experiment) was announced in September 2022 and gained traction in 2023.

6. **Hacker News and /r/rust discussion**:  
   - The tone and content resemble debates that peaked in 2022–2023, particularly around Rust's safety trade-offs and C++'s evolution.

### Outside-the-box considerations:
- The passage reads like a deliberate provocation or satire, echoing real debates but possibly exaggerating positions (e.g., dismissing memory safety, praising C++'s "nicer" community). This aligns with mid-2023 Rust/C++ discourse.
- The mention of DEC OSF/1 AXP and AIX feels like anachronistic trolling, hinting at a modern author poking fun at C++'s legacy baggage.

### Best guess:
This was likely written **between late 2022 and mid-2023**, with a probable date around **early-to-mid 2023** (e.g., March–June 2023). The combination of Carbon's recent announcement, active cppfront discussion, and Rust's TAIT being "forthcoming" but not yet stabilized points to this window. The sarcastic tone also fits the online Rust/C++ debates of that period. [end of text]
