Let's break down what happened based on the dialogue and Bob's description:

**What Bob said he ate:**
> "Today I ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat."

Let's parse this step by step:

- **Aged organic milk:** This is likely whole milk that has been aged (perhaps fermented or stored for a period to give it a tangy flavor, as is sometimes done with cultured or fermented dairy).
- **Tossed over seasoned tomato purée:** The phrase "tossed over" is unusual in culinary terms. Typically, you might spread something on a base (like bread), or mix ingredients together. "Tossed over" could mean that the milk was poured or scattered over the tomato purée, perhaps as a sauce or drizzle.
- **Spread on baked whole wheat:** This suggests that the mixture (milk over tomato purée) was then spread onto a slice of baked whole wheat bread.

So, the dish Bob prepared was likely a **savory spread** consisting of aged organic milk drizzled or poured over a seasoned tomato purée (which is basically a thick, cooked tomato sauce), and then this combined mixture was spread onto a slice of whole wheat bread that had been baked.

**Is this healthy?**

Let's analyze the components:

- **Aged organic milk:** Organic milk is usually similar in nutritional content to regular milk (provides calcium, protein, some fat). Aging (fermenting) might add probiotics if it's a cultured product, but if it's just aged (not fermented), it's still dairy with the same basic nutrients.
- **Seasoned tomato purée:** Tomato is high in vitamins (A, C), fiber, and antioxidants. Seasoning is neutral in terms of health impact.
- **Whole wheat bread:** Better than white bread for fiber and nutrients, but still a carbohydrate-rich food. If the bread is baked (not fried) and not overly processed, it's a reasonable choice.

However, the way Bob prepared it—pouring milk over the tomato purée and spreading it on bread—could result in a dish that is high in calories and fat (since milk adds fat and calories), especially if not controlled portions. It might also be high in sodium if the tomato purée is heavily seasoned. 

From a **health perspective**, this meal could be **moderately healthy** if eaten in small portions and as an occasional treat, but it's not the healthiest option for someone focusing on a balanced diet. It's higher in fat and carbs compared to a simple salad or vegetable-based meal. If Bob ate a large amount or this became a frequent meal, it might not align with strict healthy eating guidelines.

**Summary:**
- **What Bob ate:** A savory spread of aged organic milk drizzled over seasoned tomato purée, spread on a slice of baked whole wheat bread.
- **Is it healthy?** It's not the healthiest option due to higher fat and carbohydrate content, but it does include some nutritious ingredients (tomato, whole wheat). Moderation is key.

So, Alice was surprised because the combination of ingredients and method seemed unusual or perhaps unbalanced for a healthy meal. [end of text]
