Based on the content of the passage, it is difficult to determine an exact date of writing. However, I can make some inferences that may help narrow down the possible time frame.

1. The author mentions having been involved with Rust and the Rust community for many years, which suggests that it was written after 2010, when Rust first became widely available.
2. The author mentions the limitations of the Rust ecosystem, such as the dominance of the Cargo build system, which indicates that it was written after 2015, when Rust 1.0 was released and the Cargo build system was established.
3. The author compares Rust to C++, mentioning that C++ offers a variety of build systems, which suggests that it was written after 2017, when C++17 was released and introduced multiple build system options.
4. The author discusses the potential for language evolution in both Rust and C++, indicating that it was written after 2018, when both languages were still actively being developed.
5. The author mentions the possibility of migrating from Rust to C++, which suggests that it was written after 2020, when Rust 1.30 was released and the Rust community began to consider moving to other languages.

Considering these factors, it is likely that the passage was written between 2015 and 2020. However, it is still possible that it was written earlier or later, depending on the specific features and developments in the programming communities at that time. [end of text]
