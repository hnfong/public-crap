Based on the content of the passage, it is difficult to determine the exact date of its writing. However, I can make an educated guess by considering the writing style and the context of the article.

The writing style of the article suggests that it was written in early 2020 or early 2021. This is because the author mentions the following:

1. The Rust language and its community have been around for many years, but the author has grown frustrated with its limitations and is considering switching to C++.
2. The author mentions that the Cargo build system is the dominant build system in the Rust ecosystem, which was announced in early 2020.
3. The author mentions that C++ has a variety of build systems, such as CMake, Meson, and Autotools, which indicates that the article was written after the release of C++20 in 2020, as C++20 introduced new build system features.
4. The author mentions that C++ is evolving to become safer, which suggests that the article was written after the release of C++20, as C++20 introduced improvements to memory safety features.

Taking all these factors into account, I would guess that the article was written in early 2020 or early 2021. However, it is important to note that this is just an educated guess, and the actual date of writing may vary. [end of text]
