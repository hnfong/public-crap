This article was likely written in **April**. 

Here's why:

The author's tone is highly sarcastic and flippant, particularly when discussing the Rust community and its perceived "imperiousness" and focus on diversity.  This kind of humor, while not exclusive to April, is strongly associated with **April Fool's Day**. 

The author's  choice to  "jokingly"  dismiss the importance of memory safety and the value of Rust's safety guarantees, coupled with the  over-the-top praise for C++'s future, all point towards a satirical piece intended to be humorous and perhaps even a bit provocative.
