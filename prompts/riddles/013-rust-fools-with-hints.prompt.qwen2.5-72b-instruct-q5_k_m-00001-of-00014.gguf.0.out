The passage you provided is likely written on or around April 1st, which is known as April Fool's Day. The distinctive writing style and the content of the article are characteristic of an April Fool's joke, particularly in the tech and programming communities.

Hereâ€™s how the hint and the content of the passage support this conclusion:

1. **Tone and Style**: The article has a somewhat tongue-in-cheek tone, which is common in April Fool's jokes. The author presents a series of arguments that, while plausible, are also somewhat exaggerated or contrived. For example, the claim that the Rust community is "extremely imperious" and the assertion that the C++ community is "much nicer and friendlier" are overgeneralizations that are often used in humorous or satirical contexts.

2. **Content and Context**: The article discusses a significant shift from Rust to C++, which is a major and somewhat controversial decision. The reasons given for this shift, while not entirely implausible, are presented in a way that seems designed to provoke discussion and reaction. This is a common strategy in April Fool's jokes, where the goal is to create a plausible but surprising scenario that people will talk about.

3. **Community Reactions**: The article invites discussion on platforms like Hacker News and Reddit, which are known for their active and sometimes skeptical communities. April Fool's jokes often spread quickly on these platforms, and the invitation to discuss the article on these sites is a classic way to engage the community in the joke.

4. **Historical Precedents**: In the tech and programming communities, April Fool's jokes are a well-established tradition. Many tech companies and individuals have published similar articles or announcements on April 1st, often with a mix of plausible and outlandish claims.

Given these points, it is highly likely that the article was written on or around April 1st, making it an April Fool's joke. The distinctive writing style and the nature of the content align perfectly with the tradition of April Fool's jokes in the tech community. [end of text]
