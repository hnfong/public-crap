Based on the content of the passage, this text appears to be written around **mid-to-late 2023**, with a few key indicators:

### **1. C++20 and C++26 Timeline**
- The author mentions **C++20** (released in 2020) and **C++26** (expected in 2026).
  - Since C++20 was already out by 2023, the mention of C++26 being "likely" suggests this was written **before 2026**, but not too far after C++20’s release.
  - The author seems optimistic about C++26 features like **stackful coroutines** and **safe range-based for loops**, which were still in development around **2023–2024**.

### **2. Rust’s Evolution & "Type Alias Impl Trait"**
- The author notes that Rust’s recent features (like **generic associated types** and **"type alias impl trait"**) feel more like refinements than revolutionary changes.
  - **"Type alias impl trait"** was stabilized in **Rust 1.65 (November 2022)**, but the phrasing suggests this was written **after its stabilization** (since it’s described as "forthcoming").
  - The tone implies Rust’s innovation pace has slowed, which aligns with **2023–2024** discussions about Rust’s maturity and the shift toward stability over rapid feature additions.

### **3. CMake vs. Meson & Build System Trends**
- The author mentions **CMake** as the likely choice for Linebender, with **Meson** as a potential alternative.
  - **Meson** gained significant traction in **2022–2023** as a modern alternative to CMake, especially in Rust-heavy projects (e.g., Godot switched to Meson in 2022).
  - The mention of **Bazel** (common in polyglot projects) and **Autotools** suggests a **2020s** perspective, but the focus on **CMake/Meson** points to **late 2022–2023**.

### **4. Rust Community & Social Media Perception**
- The author criticizes Rust’s **"imperious" community** and mentions **Hacker News** and **/r/rust** as discussion platforms.
  - The **Rust community’s perceived elitism** was a recurring topic in **2022–2023**, with debates about **Rust’s adoption pressure** and **code of conduct debates** (e.g., Rust’s controversial RFCs on inclusivity).
  - The **Hacker News/Reddit mention** suggests this was written **after 2020**, but the tone aligns more with **2023’s Rust fatigue discussions**.

### **5. Herb Sutter’s C++ Front & Carbon Language**
- The author mentions **Herb Sutter’s proposed `cppfront`** (a C++ syntax rewrite tool) and the **Carbon language** (a new C++-compatible language by Google).
  - **`cppfront`** was announced in **2022** (with early prototypes), and **Carbon** was still in **early development (2023)**.
  - The mention of these as **"exciting changes to look forward to"** suggests **late 2022–2023**, when these were still speculative but gaining attention.

### **6. Linebender Project Context**
- **Linebender** is a **Rust-based 2D graphics engine** (part of the **Skia/Flutter ecosystem**).
  - The project was **announced in 2022** and had **active Rust development until ~2023**.
  - The shift to **C++** suggests this was written **after 2023**, but the **C++26 expectations** push it closer to **mid-2023**.

### **Final Estimate: Likely Late 2023 (Q3–Q4)**
- The **C++26 expectations**, **Rust’s perceived slowdown**, and **Carbon/`cppfront` discussions** all point to **late 2023**.
- The **Linebender team’s Rust-to-C++ shift** was announced in **November 2023**, so this could be a **pre-announcement or early 2024 draft**.

**Best guess: December 2023 – January 2024.**

*(If forced to pick a single month, I’d say **December 2023**, given the C++26 timeline and Rust community critiques.)* [end of text]
