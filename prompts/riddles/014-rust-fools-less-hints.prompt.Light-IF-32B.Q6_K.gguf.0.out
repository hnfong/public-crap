Based on the passage, my best guess is that this was written **in early to mid-2024**. Here's the reasoning behind this conclusion:

---

### 1. **Mention of C++26 and upcoming features**
The passage states:  
> "Looking forward, C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies."

C++26 is the next major version of C++ after C++23, and as of 2024, it is still in the standardization process (with a likely final release in 2026). The author refers to it as a future version, so the text must have been written **before C++26 is finalized**—which aligns with 2024.

---

### 2. **Mention of "cppfront" by Herb Sutter**
The passage says:  
> "C++ has even more exciting changes to look forward to, including potentially a new syntax as proposed by Herb Sutter cppfront..."

Herb Sutter's "cppfront" is a recent proposal (announced in 2023) for a new syntax for C++ that could be compiled to standard C++. The fact that it's described as a "potential" or "future" change suggests the text was written **after 2023** (when the proposal was announced) but **before it's widely adopted**.

---

### 3. **Mention of "type alias impl trait" in Rust**
The passage says:  
> "the forthcoming 'type alias impl trait' is similar" to generic associated types.

"type alias impl trait" is a feature that was **proposed and discussed in 2023** and was expected to be stabilized in **Rust 1.70+** (around mid-2023). The fact that it's described as "forthcoming" suggests the text was written **after mid-2023** but **before it's stabilized**.

---

### 4. **Mention of "C++20" as a recent feature**
The passage says:  
> "C++20 brings us modules, an innovative new feature, and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon."

C++20 was officially standardized in 2020, but widespread adoption of modules (a key feature) was still ongoing as of 2023–2024. The phrase "looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon" suggests the author is writing **in 2023–2024**, when modules were becoming more common but not yet universal.

---

### 5. **Mention of "Hacker News" and "/r/rust" as places to discuss**
The passage ends with:  
> "Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust."

This is a common way to link to discussions for programming-related posts, and while it's not a strong indicator of date, it's consistent with modern (2020s) writing styles.

---

### 6. **Tone and context of the Rust community**
The passage criticizes the Rust community for being "imperious" and "constantly demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust." This tone aligns with **2023–2024**, a period when debates about Rust's dominance in certain niches (e.g., embedded, systems programming) were more visible, and some developers were pushing back.

---

### 7. **Mention of "Linebender projects"**
The author refers to "Linebender projects" as the projects being moved from Rust to C++. While this is a specific detail, it's not well-known to the public, so it's not a strong date indicator, but it suggests the author is writing about a personal or small-team project, which is plausible for 2024.

---

### Putting it all together:
- C++26 is future → 2024 or earlier.
- "cppfront" is a recent proposal → 2023 or later.
- "type alias impl trait" is forthcoming → mid-2023 or later.
- C++20 modules are "being implemented soon" → 2023–2024.
- Rust community tone → 2023–2024.

---

### Final Guess:
**Early to mid-2024** (e.g., January–June 2024)

This is the most plausible timeframe that fits all the clues in the passage. [end of text]
