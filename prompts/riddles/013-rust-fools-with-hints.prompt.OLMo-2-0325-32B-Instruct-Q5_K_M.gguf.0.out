Based on the distinctive writing style and the mention of C++20 features such as modules, which were expected to be implemented "fairly soon," and the anticipation of C++26 features, this passage was likely written after the release of C++20 but before the features of C++26 were finalized or widely discussed. C++20 was officially released in December 2019. Given the context and the anticipation of future features, the passage was likely written in the first half of 2020, possibly around March or April, when the excitement around C++20 was still fresh and developers were looking forward to its adoption and the next set of features in C++26.

The hint about a distinctive writing style connected to a particular day and month of the year, combined with the anticipation of new C++ features, suggests a time when the author was reflecting on the state of programming languages and the community around them. The mention of "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies" indicates a forward-looking perspective, which is more likely in the early stages after C++20's release when developers were still digesting the new features and looking ahead to the next standard.

The mention of "C++26" and the anticipation of its features, along with the author's tone of looking forward to these advancements, points to a time when C++20 was new enough to be a topic of conversation but not so new that the community had fully adopted it. This places the writing in early 2020, before the community had moved on to discussing C++26 in detail, which would have been too far in the future for such specific anticipation.

Therefore, considering the context and the hint, I would estimate that this passage was written in March or April 2020. The author's tone and the anticipation of future C++ features align with a period shortly after the release of C++20, when developers were still excited about its new features and looking forward to the next major update. This timeframe also allows for the author to reflect on the state of Rust and C++ communities without the influence of more recent developments in either language.

**How the hint is used:** The hint suggests a distinctive writing style connected to a specific time. Given the anticipation of C++26 features and the reflection on C++20, the writing style and content suggest a period of transition and anticipation, which fits well with early 2020. The mention of specific future features of C++26, which at the time of writing were still in the realm of anticipation rather than discussion, narrows down the timeframe to a period shortly after C++20's release, when developers were looking ahead to the next major update. This aligns with the hint's suggestion of a distinctive writing style tied to a specific time, as the author's tone reflects the zeitgeist of the programming community at that moment.
