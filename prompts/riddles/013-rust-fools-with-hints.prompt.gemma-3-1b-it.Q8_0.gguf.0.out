My best guess is **December 2023**.

Here’s how I arrived at this conclusion, leveraging the provided text and considering the clues:

* **“I’ve been involved in Rust and the Rust community for many years now.”** – This suggests a relatively recent engagement, likely sometime in 2023.
* **“Choice of build systems”** – The discussion about build systems and the limitations of Cargo is a very current topic, particularly as the Rust ecosystem continues to evolve.
* **“Safety”** – The passage explicitly mentions the concerns about safety guarantees and the desire to move towards a more mature language, which aligns with the ongoing discussions around Rust’s evolution and the C++ community’s perspective.
* **“Language evolution”** – The mention of C++26, the “type alias impl trait,” and the “carbon language” all point to a significant shift in the language’s direction, suggesting a focus on future development and a move away from the current, more cautious approach.
* **“Community”** – The emphasis on the C++ community’s friendliness and the desire to “rid of that” indicates a recent shift in the Rust community’s priorities. The call for help with the C++ rewrite is a recent activity.
* **“We’re looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite”** – This is a very recent announcement, likely posted in late 2023 or early 2024.

**How the hint is used:** The passage’s tone – a nostalgic reflection on Rust’s journey, coupled with a forward-looking assessment of the C++ community – is characteristic of the style of writing often associated with December 2023. The mention of the “carbon language” and the desire to “take the Linebender projects to a mature, production-ready language” are strong indicators of this timeframe.

It’s a subtle connection, but the combination of these elements strongly suggests this piece was written around that time. [end of text]
