Okay, let's try to figure out when this passage was written. The user provided a text where someone is talking about moving from Rust to C++ for their project, Linebender. I need to date this based on the content.

First, I'll look for specific references to versions or events that happened in Rust or C++. The author mentions C++20 and C++26. C++20 was released in December 2020. C++26 is a future standard, so the author must be writing before it's released. The text says "C++26 will likely have..." so it's probably written after C++20 but before C++26. C++26 is expected around 2026, but the author is talking about it as a future thing, so maybe they're writing in 2023 or 2024.

Wait, the author mentions "C++20 brings us modules, an innovative new feature, and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon." Modules were added in C++20, but the implementation in compilers like GCC and Clang was still a bit shaky in 2021-2022. So if they're saying "implemented fairly soon," maybe it's around 2021-2022. But the text says "C++20 brings us modules," which was released in 2020, so the author is probably writing after 2020.

Then there's a mention of "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines..." Stackful coroutines are part of C++26, which is still in development. The C++26 standard is expected to be finalized around 2026, so the author is writing before that. But the key here is that the author is talking about C++26 as a future standard, so the date must be before 2026.

Looking at Rust's timeline: the author says Rust's innovation has slowed, with features like generic associated types (GATs) and "type alias impl trait" being the latest. GATs were stabilized in Rust 1.65 (released in 2022), and type alias impl trait was stabilized in 1.70 (2023). Wait, but the author says "the forthcoming 'type alias impl trait' is similar," so maybe it's before it was stabilized. If it's "forthcoming," then it's probably before it was stabilized. Let's check Rust's release dates.

Rust 1.65 was released in 2022-10-27, which stabilized GATs. Type alias impl trait was stabilized in Rust 1.70 (2023-06-29). So if the author is talking about it as "forthcoming," maybe they wrote this before Rust 1.70, so around 2023.

Wait, the author also mentions "the edition mechanism" in Rust, which is a way to avoid breaking changes. Rust editions are every 2 years, with 2021 being 2021 edition, 2024 being 2024 edition. The author says Rust is held back by the edition mechanism, which is a known point of contention. So the edition mechanism has been around since Rust 1.15 (2017), but the author is comparing it to C++'s approach.

Another clue: the author mentions "the Linebender projects" and says they're looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite. I should check if Linebender is a real project. A quick search: Linebender is a Rust-based GUI framework. Wait, but the author is moving it to C++. Maybe it's a fictional project, but the name might be a clue. Wait, maybe it's a real project. Let me think. There's a project called Linebender, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's a reference to something else.

Wait, the author mentions "the Linebender projects" and says they're moving to C++. If I search for Linebender in Rust, there's a project called Linebender, but I think it's a real one. Wait, maybe it's a typo or a reference to something else. Alternatively, maybe it's a made-up name. But the key is the content.

Another point: the author says "C++20 brings us modules, an innovative new feature, and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon." So modules were part of C++20, but the implementation in compilers was still being worked on. For example, Clang added modules in 2020, but maybe the author is writing when it's still new. So maybe 2021-2022.

Wait, the author also mentions "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines." Stackful coroutines are part of C++26, which is still in the works. The C++26 standard is expected to be released in 2026, so the author is writing before that. But the key is the current year.

Looking at the Rust community part: the author says the Rust community is "extremely imperious, constantly demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust, and denigrating all other programming languages." This is a common criticism of Rust, but when did this become a notable issue? The Rust community has been known for being welcoming, but there's been some criticism about "Rust evangelism." However, the author's tone is negative, so maybe it's a recent complaint.

Also, the author mentions "the C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor." The C++ subreddit (r/cpp) is active, but I'm not sure about the humor part. Maybe it's a joke.

Another clue: the author says "the Rust community is also known for its code of conduct and other policies promoting diversity. I firmly believe that programming languages should be free of politics, focused strictly on the technology itself." This is a common argument against diversity initiatives in tech, often made by people who oppose such policies. The timing here might be around when Rust's code of conduct became more prominent. Rust's code of conduct was established early on, but the community's focus on diversity has been a point of discussion. However, the author's stance is a bit dated because the Rust community has been quite active in promoting inclusivity, so this might be a recent complaint.

Wait, the author says "I understand how some identity groups may desire more representation, but I feel it is not necessary." This is a common argument against diversity initiatives, which has been around for a while, but maybe the timing is when such arguments were more prevalent.

Now, looking at the C++26 reference. If the author is writing in 2023, C++26 is still a few years away. Let's check the C++ standards timeline. C++20 was 2020, C++23 was 2023, C++26 is expected 2026. Wait, C++23 was released in December 2023. So if the author is talking about C++26, they must be writing before C++23, because C++23 is the next standard after C++20. Wait, no: C++20 (2020), C++23 (2023), C++26 (2026). So if the author is writing about C++26, it's after C++23. But the author says "C++26 will likely have..." so it's before C++26. So the date must be after C++23 (2023) but before 2026. But the author also mentions C++20's modules being implemented "fairly soon," which would be after C++20's release in 2020. So maybe the author is writing in 2023 or 2024.

Wait, the author says "C++20 brings us modules... I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon." If C++20 was released in 2020, and modules were implemented in compilers around 2020-2021, then "fairly soon" would be 2020-2021. But the author is writing about it as a current thing, so maybe 2021. But the Rust part mentions "generic associated types" which were stabilized in 2022. Let's check Rust's release dates.

Rust 1.65 (2022-10-27) stabilized GATs. The author says "recently landed features such as generic associated types have more of the flavor of making combinations of existing features work as expected rather than bringing any fundamentally new capabilities." So if GATs were stabilized in 2022, the author is writing after that, so 2022 or later.

The "type alias impl trait" was stabilized in Rust 1.70 (2023-06-29). The author says "the forthcoming 'type alias impl trait' is similar," so it's before it was stabilized. So if it's "forthcoming," the author wrote before June 2023.

So combining that, the Rust part suggests the author wrote before Rust 1.70, so before June 2023.

C++26 is still in the future, so the author is writing before 2026. But the key is the Rust version.

Another point: the author mentions "C++20 brings us modules... and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon." If modules were implemented in compilers around 2020-2021, then "fairly soon" would be 2020-2021. But the author is writing about it as a current development, so maybe 2021. But the Rust part
