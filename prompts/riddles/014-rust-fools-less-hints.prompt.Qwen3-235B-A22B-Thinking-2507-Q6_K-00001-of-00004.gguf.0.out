Let me analyze this passage to determine when it was likely written. I'll look for specific clues about dates, technologies, and events mentioned in the text.

Key points to consider:

1. Rust language development timeline
2. C++ version releases mentioned
3. Specific features discussed
4. Community dynamics described
4. References to other technologies or events

Let's break down the specific clues:

1. C++ versions mentioned:
   - C++20 is mentioned as bringing "modules, an innovative new feature, and one I'm looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon."
   - C++26 is mentioned as "likely [having] stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop"

2. Rust features mentioned:
   - "generic associated types" as "recently landed features"
   - "type alias impl trait" as "forthcoming"

3. Other technology references:
   - Mentions "cppfront" by Herb Sutter
   - Mentions Carbon language
   - References to "Zulip instance" for collaboration

Let me research the timeline of these features:

For C++:
- C++20 was officially released in December 2020
- The modules feature in C++20 took time to be fully implemented across compilers
- C++23 was the next standard after C++20 (released in 2023)
- C++26 is the planned next standard after C++23

For Rust:
- Generic Associated Types (GATs) were stabilized in Rust 1.65 (November 2022)
- Type Alias Impl Trait (TAIT) was still in development as of late 2023/early 2024

For other references:
- Herb Sutter's cppfront was announced around mid-2022
- Carbon language was announced by Google in July 2022

The passage mentions C++26 features as something "looking forward" to, which suggests this was written before C++26 was finalized (which won't happen for several years). It also mentions C++20 modules as something that will be "implemented fairly soon," suggesting that full implementation wasn't widespread yet.

The Rust features mentioned give us good clues:
- GATs were stabilized in November 2022
- The passage refers to them as "recently landed"
- TAIT is mentioned as "forthcoming" - this feature was still in development as of late 2023

The passage also mentions Carbon language as something "including potentially" coming, which suggests it was relatively new when this was written. Carbon was announced in July 2022.

Let me check the status of C++ modules implementation across compilers:
- GCC added experimental modules support in version 11 (September 2021)
- Clang added modules support starting in version 14 (early 2022)
- MSVC had modules support in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.9 (early 2021)

The author says they're "looking forward to [C++ modules] actually being implemented fairly soon," which suggests this was written when modules support was still spotty across compilers - likely sometime in 2022 when the feature was standardized but not yet well implemented.

The reference to Carbon as a new development also points to mid-to-late 2022, since it was announced in July 2022.

Let's also consider the community aspects mentioned:
- The author complains about the Rust community being "extremely imperious" and mentions "code of conduct and other policies promoting diversity"
- This reflects ongoing discussions in the Rust community about its code of conduct, which had some controversies around 2021-2022

Another clue: The author mentions they're "looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite" and to "join our Zulip instance." Zulip has been around since 2015, so that doesn't give us a specific timeframe.

Let me check the timeline more precisely:

- July 2022: Carbon language announced
- November 2022: Rust 1.65 with GATs stabilized
- C++20 modules were standardized in December 2020 but implementation across compilers was still ongoing through 2021-2022

The passage refers to GATs as "recently landed" and TAIT as "forthcoming." Since GATs landed in November 2022, and TAIT was still in development after that, this suggests the passage was written sometime between late 2022 and early 2023.

The mention of C++26 features as something to look forward to (rather than something that's already in progress) suggests it's not too far in the future from when C++23 would be finalized (which happened in February 2024).

Let me check the status of TAIT (Type Alias Impl Trait):
- TAIT was proposed in RFC 3216 in December 2021
- It was implemented behind a feature flag in Rust 1.63 (August 2022)
- It was stabilized in Rust 1.80 (expected August 2024)

Since the passage refers to TAIT as "forthcoming," it suggests this was written before it was stabilized, but after it was known to be coming. Given that it was implemented behind a feature flag in August 2022, and GATs were stabilized in November 2022, the "recently landed" description for GATs suggests late 2022 or early 2023.

Another clue: The author mentions "the Rust community can be extremely imperious, constantly demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust." This reflects a sentiment that became more common as Rust gained popularity, particularly around 2021-2023.

Let me also check the status of cppfront:
- Herb Sutter announced cppfront in June 2022
- The passage mentions it as "proposed by Herb Sutter cppfront," suggesting it was relatively new

Putting all these clues together:
- Carbon language mentioned as new (announced July 2022)
- cppfront mentioned as proposed (announced June 2022)
- GATs described as "recently landed" (stabilized November 2022)
- TAIT described as "forthcoming" (implemented behind feature flag August 2022, not stabilized until expected August 2024)
- C++20 modules described as something to be "implemented fairly soon" (standardized Dec 2020, implementation ongoing through 2021-2022)

This suggests the passage was likely written in late 2022 or very early 2023. The reference to GATs as "recently landed" is particularly telling - since they were stabilized in November 2022, "recently" would likely mean December 2022 or January 2023.

Let me check if there are any other specific clues:

The author mentions "Stroustrup's paper on safety" - Bjarne Stroustrup has written several papers on safety in C++, but one notable one is "A Safety Profile for C++" which was published around 2020-2021. However, the passage describes it as "a remarkably wise and perceptive document," suggesting it's not extremely recent.

Another thought: The author mentions "the Linebender projects" - this appears to be a reference to a real organization. Let me check if I can find information about when they might have made such an announcement.

Linebender is an organization focused on creating GUI toolkits in Rust. They maintain Druid, a GUI toolkit. If I could find when they might have announced a switch from Rust to C++, that would be definitive.

Without being able to look up current information (as my knowledge is current until 2023), I'll have to rely on the internal evidence from the passage.

Let me reexamine the C++26 mention. The author says "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines..." This suggests the passage was written when C++26 was being discussed but not yet finalized. The C++ standardization process works on a 3-year cycle, with C++20 finalized in 2020, C++23 in 2023, and C++26 expected around 2026.

When would discussions about C++26 features begin? Typically, feature proposals start years in advance. By late 2022/early 2023, there would have been early discussions about what might go into C++26.

Actually, the C++ standardization process works on a 3-year cycle, with the next standard after C++20 being C++23 (finalized in February 2024), and then C++26. So when this was written, C++23 was likely still in progress, and C++26 was just starting to be discussed.

Given all these clues, my best estimate is that this passage was written in December 2022 or January 2023.

Wait, let me double-check the Rust version timeline:
- Rust 1.65 (with GATs stabilized) was released November 3, 2022
- If GATs are described as "recently landed," that suggests a timeframe of November-December 2022

The passage also mentions "the forthcoming 'type alias impl trait'". TAIT was implemented behind a feature flag in Rust 1.63 (August 2022) but wasn't stabilized until much later. So in November-December 2022, it would have been "forthcoming" in the sense of not yet stabilized.

Another clue: The author mentions "async has been a major effort" in Rust. Async/await was stabilized in Rust
