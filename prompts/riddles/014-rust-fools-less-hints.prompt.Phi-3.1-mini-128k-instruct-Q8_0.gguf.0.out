 Based on the information provided in the passage, it is challenging to pinpoint an exact date. However, we can make an educated guess by considering the context and the state of the Rust and C++ communities at various points in time.

The passage mentions the C++20 standard, which was officially released in November 2020. This suggests that the author is familiar with the latest developments in C++. Additionally, the author discusses the potential future features of C++26, which indicates that the writing is likely to be from a time when C++26 is still in development or has just been released.

Furthermore, the author mentions the C++ community's leadership, referring to Stroustrup's paper on safety. Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, published a paper on safety in C++ in 2018. This suggests that the author is aware of the paper and its impact on the C++ community.

Considering these factors, it is reasonable to assume that the passage was written sometime between 2020 and 2022. A more specific guess would be around late 2021 or early 2022, as this would allow for the author to be familiar with both C++20 and the ongoing developments in C++26. [end of text]
