The passage appears to be written in **April 2023**, specifically around **April Fools' Day (April 1st)**. Here’s how the distinctive writing style and the hint connect to this conclusion:

### **Key Observations:**
1. **Tone and Humor:**
   - The passage is written in a **satirical, exaggerated, and tongue-in-cheek** style, mocking Rust’s ecosystem while praising C++ in an absurdly hyperbolic way.
   - The author claims to be "rid of the Rust community's imperiousness" and that C++ is "much nicer and friendlier," with a specific mention of the "C++ subreddit's sense of humor."
   - The closing line—**"Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust"**—is a classic April Fools' joke, as it implies the author is jokingly inviting Rust developers to debate their own language’s flaws.

2. **April Fools' Tradition:**
   - The passage reads like a **fake announcement** designed to provoke laughter or debate, a hallmark of April Fools' pranks in tech.
   - The exaggerated claims (e.g., "I’ve been responsible for some CVEs," "C++ is evolving to become safer," "the C++ community will be much nicer") are typical of satirical posts meant to be humorous rather than serious.

3. **Historical Context:**
   - In **April 2023**, there was a well-known **fake announcement** by a developer (likely a parody account) claiming to be switching a major Rust project (Linebender, a GUI toolkit) to C++ due to Rust’s "imperious" community and lack of build system flexibility.
   - The post was widely shared on **Hacker News and Reddit**, fitting the closing line of the passage.
   - The mention of **"C++26"** (a future standard at the time) and **"cppfront"** (a proposed C++ syntax rewrite tool) also align with discussions happening in early 2023.

### **Why Not Another Time?**
- If this were serious, the tone would be more measured. The **over-the-top praise for C++** and **mockery of Rust** are too exaggerated for a real announcement.
- The **specific mention of "April Fools' Day" humor** (e.g., "I will be glad to be rid of that") is a dead giveaway.
- The **timing of the fake announcement** in April 2023 matches known tech pranks of that year.

### **Conclusion:**
This is almost certainly a **satirical April Fools' joke from April 2023**, likely written to provoke discussion and laughter rather than serious debate. The writing style, humor, and references all point to this being a **fake announcement** meant to be taken lightly. [end of text]
