<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer: Why did the clerk say "Be sure to cover it when you leave your house." The lady asked "Why? Spirits?" So the clerk's advice: cover the crystal ball when leaving house. Why? Possibly because the ball is a portal to spirits, or it attracts spirits, or it's a mirror that can trap spirits. Covering it prevents spirits from entering or leaving. Or it's a protective measure: the ball might be a conduit for negative energies, so covering it prevents spirits from seeing it or being attracted. The clerk might be a practitioner of occult, telling to cover to avoid attracting spirits. Or maybe it's a superstition: covering the crystal ball prevents it from being used by thieves or spirits. The clerk might be a psychic or a shop owner who knows that crystal balls can be used to see spirits, so covering it prevents spirits from seeing the owner. Or the clerk might be a ghost who warns that the ball is haunted. The question: "Why did the clerk say this? Explain concisely." So answer: The clerk warned that the crystal ball is a portal to the spirit world; covering it prevents spirits from entering or being attracted. Or that the ball is a mirror that can trap spirits; covering it protects the owner. So answer concisely: The clerk was warning that the crystal ball can attract or trap spirits, so covering it when leaving the house prevents spirits from seeing or entering. Or that the ball is a conduit for spirits, and covering it stops them from seeing the owner. Let's craft a concise explanation: The clerk was warning that the crystal ball is a portal to the spirit world; covering it when leaving the house prevents spirits from seeing the owner or being attracted to the ball.

Let's answer.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>The clerk was warning that the crystal ball is a conduit to the spirit world.  
When left uncovered, it can “see” or attract spirits, and those entities can use the ball as a portal or a mirror to enter the house or to trap the owner.  
Covering it when you leave the house keeps the ball “blind” to the spirits and blocks any unwanted contact. [end of text]
