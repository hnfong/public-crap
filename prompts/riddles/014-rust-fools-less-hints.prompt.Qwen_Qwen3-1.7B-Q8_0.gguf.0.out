The passage is a reflective and somewhat critical essay written by a contributor to the Rust programming language community. It discusses the limitations of the Rust ecosystem, the advantages of C++ in terms of build systems, safety, language evolution, and community dynamics.

### Key Observations:

1. **Language and Community Context**:
   - The author is critical of Rust's safety guarantees and the pace of its evolution.
   - They compare Rust to C++, noting that C++ is more flexible and forward-looking in its development.

2. **Build Systems**:
   - The author mentions CMake, Meson, and other build systems, suggesting that the Rust ecosystem is limited in this area.
   - They also mention the use of Autotools and make for cross-compilation, which is a common practice in C++.

3. **Community Dynamics**:
   - The author expresses a preference for the C++ community, noting that the Rust community is perceived as more "imperious" and less welcoming.
   - They also mention the Rust community's code of conduct and diversity policies, which are positive but not the focus of the essay.

4. **Language Evolution**:
   - The author mentions C++20 features like modules and coroutines, and notes that C++ is more likely to adopt new features in each version.
   - They contrast this with Rust's slower pace of innovation, which they see as a limitation.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The author concludes that the Linebender projects should be moved to a "mature, production-ready language" and expresses a desire to collaborate with the C++ community.

### Reasoning for the Date:

The passage is written in a tone that suggests the author is experienced and has been involved with the Rust community for many years. The mention of "Linebender projects" and the discussion of build systems, safety, and language evolution are all topics that are relevant to the Rust ecosystem.

The author also mentions the C++ community's leadership and the potential for C++ to evolve more rapidly, which suggests that the author is writing from a perspective that is informed by current practices and trends in the C++ community.

### Conclusion:

The passage is likely written **around 2019**. This is based on the following reasoning:

- The author is critical of Rust's safety and evolution, which were topics of discussion in 2019.
- The mention of C++20 features and the comparison to C++'s evolution in 2019 aligns with the time frame.
- The author's preference for C++ and the mention of the C++ community's leadership in 2019 supports this date.

### Final Answer:
**2019** [end of text]
