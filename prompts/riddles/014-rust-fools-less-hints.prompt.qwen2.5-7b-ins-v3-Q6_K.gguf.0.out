<Thought>
Alright, I need to determine the approximate date when this passage was written. Let's start by analyzing the content and looking for any clues that might hint at the time period.

First, the passage discusses Rust and the Rust community, mentioning involvement over "many years." Rust was officially announced in 2010, so involvement spanning years would place the writing sometime after 2010.

Next, the author mentions the "Cargo build system and package manager," which is Rust's primary build tool. Cargo was introduced in Rust 1.0, which was released in May 2015. This suggests that the writing is after 2015.

The passage also refers to "Rust 1.0" and discusses features like "async," which was introduced in Rust 1.0. The author criticizes Rust's pace of innovation, saying it has become more "sedate" compared to C++. This indicates that the writing is after Rust 1.0 but before significant changes in Rust's development pace.

The author mentions "Rust 2018" and "Rust 2021," which are edition changes in Rust. Rust 2018 was a major edition that introduced many new features and changes to the language. Rust 2021 followed, introducing more features like "type alias impl trait." The author seems to be aware of these editions, suggesting the writing is around the time these editions were being discussed or implemented.

Additionally, the passage references "C++20," which was released in 2020, and mentions "C++26," which is a future version. The author is excited about upcoming features in C++, indicating that the writing is around the time these features were being planned or discussed.

The author also mentions "Zulip instance," which is a chat server platform. Zulip was launched in 2013 and has been widely used in various communities, including programming languages. This suggests the writing is after 2013.

The passage discusses the "Hacker News" and "/r/rust" communities, which are active platforms for discussing programming languages and projects. Hacker News was founded in 2006, and /r/rust is a subreddit that started in 2013. The author's familiarity with these platforms indicates the writing is after 2013.

The author also references "Herb Sutter cppfront," which is related to C++ development. Herb Sutter is a prominent figure in the C++ community, and cppfront was a proposal for a new C++ compiler front-end. This suggests the writing is around the time these discussions were active, likely in the mid to late 2010s.

Considering all these factors—the introduction of Cargo in 2015, Rust 1.0 in 2015, Rust 2018 and 2021 editions, C++20 and future C++26 features, Zulip's launch in 2013, and the active Hacker News and /r/rust communities—the writing is most likely in the mid to late 2010s, specifically around 2018 or 2019.

However, the author mentions "C++26," which is a future version, indicating that the writing is not too far in the past. Given the current date is 2023, and C++26 is not yet released, the writing is likely from around 2018 or 2019.

But to be more precise, considering the Rust 2021 edition was released in 2021, and the author is discussing features that were being planned or discussed around that time, the writing is probably from 2018 or 2019.

Alternatively, if the author is referring to the release of Rust 2021, which was in 2021, and considering the passage discusses Rust's pace of innovation becoming more sedate, it might be from around 2018 or 2019, anticipating Rust's future developments.

In conclusion, the passage was likely written in the late 2010s, specifically around 2018 or 2019, given the references to Rust 1.0, Rust 2018, Rust 2021, and the anticipation of C++26 features.
