Based on the internal evidence and external context, this passage was written on **April 1, 2024**.

Here is the breakdown of why this is the most logical conclusion:

**1. The "Smoking Gun": The Author and Project**
The author mentions "Linebender projects" and "creating infrastructure for building GUI toolkits." In the real world, **Raph Levien** is the founder of the Linebender project (which includes tools like *Druid* and *Vello*). He is a prominent figure in the Rust GUI community.

On **April 1, 2024**, Raph Levien published a blog post titled "Moving Linebender to C++" that matches the text provided here almost word-for-word.

**2. The Date Context: April Fools' Day**
The content of the post is highly incongruous with reality, which serves as the primary clue that it is an April Fools' joke:
*   **The Argument:** The author argues that C++ is safer and more stable than Rust because he considers himself a "good enough programmer" to avoid memory safety bugs. This is a satirical inversion of the primary selling point of Rust (memory safety).
*   **The "Safety" Section:** The author claims that memory safety bugs are "overblown" and that crashing GUI apps are "not that big a deal." This is a humorous take that contradicts the entire industry trend toward memory-safe languages.
*   **The "Community" Section:** The author praises the C++ subreddit for its "sense of humor" and claims the C++ community is "nicer and friendlier" than the Rust community. This is a classic trope in programming April Fools' jokes—poking fun at language tribalism.
*   **The "Unix" Reference:** The mention of compiling for "AIX and DEC OSF/1 AXP" (obscure, legacy Unix variants) is a joke about the age and complexity of C++ build systems compared to Cargo.

**3. Technical References**
*   **C++26:** The mention of C++26 features (stackful coroutines, etc.) places the text in a timeframe where C++26 is a future standard. C++26 is the working name for the standard expected in 2026, making 2024 the active development period.
*   **Herb Sutter's cppfront:** This is a real proposal (Cpp2), often discussed in 2023-2024 as a potential future for C++ syntax.

**Conclusion**
While the technical references to C++26 suggest a contemporary timeframe (2023–2024), the specific combination of the author's identity (Raph Levien), the project name (Linebender), and the satirical nature of the arguments confirms this is the April Fools' blog post from **April 1, 2024**.
