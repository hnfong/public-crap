Based on the passage, the most likely date this was written is **2023-10-27**. Here’s my reasoning:

* **Contextual Details:** The passage explicitly mentions “Linebender projects” and a desire to “take the Linebender projects to a mature, production-ready language.” This suggests a recent project and a focus on a specific, ongoing effort.
* **Language Discussions:** The passage heavily revolves around language choices – Rust vs. C++, CMake, and the evolution of C++. These are topics that are actively discussed and debated within the Rust and C++ communities, particularly in the last few years.
* **Community Sentiment:** The passage expresses a desire to move away from perceived “imperiousness” and “denigration” within the Rust community, suggesting a growing awareness of the challenges and a desire for a more collaborative approach. This aligns with the increasing focus on community building and a move towards more mature development practices.
* **Zulip Instance:** The mention of joining a Zulip instance for the C++ rewrite is a relatively recent trend, and it’s common for individuals to actively seek out and participate in community initiatives.

While it’s *possible* it could be older, the combination of these factors strongly points to 2023. [end of text]
