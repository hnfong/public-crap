Based on a careful analysis of the passage, including technical details, cultural references, and subtle linguistic cues, the most plausible date this was written is **late 2023 to early 2024**, with a strong likelihood of **December 2023**.

Here’s the reasoning, broken down by key indicators:

---

### 1. **C++26 and C++20 Features**
- The author mentions **C++20** having modules and **C++26** having features like:
  - Stackful coroutines
  - Embedding binary data in arrays
  - Safe range-based for loops
- **C++26** was **not finalized** as of late 2023. The ISO C++ committee was still actively working on it, with the draft expected to be completed in **2024**, and the official standard likely to be published in **2026**.
- The author says: *"C++26 will likely have..."* — this phrasing suggests **speculation about a future standard**, not a confirmed feature. This fits perfectly with the state of C++26 in late 2023, when the community was discussing its roadmap but not yet seeing concrete implementations.

---

### 2. **cppfront and Carbon Language**
- The author references **Herb Sutter’s cppfront** proposal and the **Carbon language** as "potentially" exciting future developments.
- **cppfront** was a **2023 proposal** by Herb Sutter, presented at the **CppCon 2023** conference. It was a **highly publicized** and controversial idea to redesign C++ syntax.
- **Carbon** (Google’s experimental language aiming to replace C++) was also **announced in 2023**, with early prototypes and discussions gaining traction in late 2023.
- The fact that both are mentioned as **"potentially"** new directions suggests they were **recently in the news**, not yet mainstream or implemented — which aligns with **late 2023**.

---

### 3. **Rust’s “Edition Mechanism” and Pace of Innovation**
- The author criticizes Rust’s **"commitment to not break existing code"** via editions, saying it slows innovation.
- This criticism reflects a **common sentiment in the Rust community in 2023**, especially after the **Rust 2024 edition** was announced (though not yet released), and after the **"Rust 2024"** roadmap was discussed at RustConf 2023.
- The mention of **"generic associated types"** and **"type alias impl trait"** as incremental improvements (not fundamentally new) reflects a **2023-era perception** — these features were **recently stabilized** or **in active development** around that time.

---

### 4. **CMake vs. Bazel / Meson / SCons**
- The author praises CMake and mentions Meson as a possible alternative.
- **Meson** gained significant traction in 2022–2023, especially in the GNOME and Linux ecosystems.
- The mention of **AIX and DEC OSF/1 AXP** as examples of legacy Unix systems is **very niche** and **historically specific**. This is not a common reference in modern discussions unless someone is writing about **legacy system compatibility** or **long-term software sustainability** — a topic that gained attention in 2023 due to concerns about **software obsolescence** and **long-term maintenance**.

---

### 5. **Social Media and Community Tone**
- The author claims the **Rust community is "imperious"** and **"constantly demanding projects be rewritten in Rust"**, while the **C++ subreddit is "well known for their sense of humor"**.
- This is **highly ironic and satirical** — the C++ subreddit is famously known for **self-deprecating humor**, **trolling**, and **mocking Rust**. The author is likely **parodying** the Rust community’s perceived elitism by contrasting it with C++’s "humor".
- This kind of **meta-commentary** — where the author **mocks both communities** while pretending to be a convert — is **typical of late 2023 internet culture**, especially on platforms like **Hacker News**, **Reddit**, and **Zulip**.
- The **"Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust"** line at the end is **a dead giveaway** — it’s a **common trope** in **satirical or ironic tech posts** from late 2023, where authors write exaggerated rants about abandoning Rust, then invite discussion on the very communities they’re mocking.

---

### 6. **Zulip Instance and "Linebender"**
- The **Linebender** project is **not a real, widely known project** in the Rust or C++ ecosystem.
- However, **"Linebender"** is a **known nickname** for **a fictional or satirical project** in the Rust community, often used in **jokes about GUI toolkits** (e.g., "Rust GUIs are too hard, so I’ll write a Linebender in C++").
- The **Zulip instance** reference is **very specific** — Zulip is used by **real open-source projects**, but the **combination of "Linebender" + "C++ rewrite" + "Zulip" + "Hacker News"** is **strongly suggestive of a satirical post**.

---

### 7. **Conclusion: This is Likely a Satirical or Ironic Post**
The tone is **over-the-top**, **self-aware**, and **full of contradictions**:
- The author claims to be a "good enough programmer" who avoids CVEs, yet admits to having caused one in Android.
- They claim C++ is safer now, despite its reputation for memory errors.
- They praise C++ community for being "nicer" while acknowledging C++’s history of elitism and toxicity.
- They claim Rust is "political" while ignoring that C++ has its own **diversity debates** and **community tensions**.

This is **not a genuine technical transition** — it’s a **satirical commentary** on:
- The **Rust community’s perceived gatekeeping**
- The **over-hype around Rust’s safety**
- The **cultural clash between Rust and C++ communities**
- The **irony of "mature" languages being used for new projects**

---

### Final Verdict:
This was **written in late 2023**, likely **December 2023**, as a **satirical or ironic post** meant to provoke discussion on **Hacker News** and **/r/rust**.

It reflects:
- The **real concerns** about Rust’s pace of innovation and community culture
- The **real excitement** around C++26, cppfront, and Carbon
- The **real tension** between Rust’s safety promises and C++’s flexibility

But it **exaggerates** these points for **humor and commentary**, not as a real migration plan.

> ✅ **Best guess: December 2023** [end of text]
