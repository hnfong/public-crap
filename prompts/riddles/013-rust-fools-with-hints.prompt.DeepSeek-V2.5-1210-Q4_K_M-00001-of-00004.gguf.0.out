The passage was likely written on **April 1st**, commonly known as **April Fools' Day**. Here's how the hint about the distinctive writing style connects to this conclusion:

1. **Contrarian Tone**: The author expresses frustration with Rust and praises C++ in a way that seems exaggerated or ironic, especially given Rust's reputation for safety and modernity, and C++'s reputation for complexity and safety issues. This contrarian tone is a hallmark of April Fools' jokes, where writers often take a deliberately absurd or exaggerated stance to amuse readers.

2. **Language Evolution Claims**: The passage mentions specific C++ features like "stackful coroutines" and "safe range-based for loops" in C++26, which seem overly optimistic or speculative for a language that typically evolves more conservatively. This kind of forward-looking speculation, combined with the exaggerated praise for C++, suggests a playful, satirical tone.

3. **Community Criticism**: The author critiques the Rust community for being "imperious" and overly focused on diversity and inclusion, while praising the C++ community for being "nicer and friendlier." This juxtaposition of stereotypes is a classic trope in April Fools' jokes, where communities or technologies are caricatured for comedic effect.

4. **Conclusion and Call to Action**: The final call to action, "We’re looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite," is a tongue-in-cheek invitation that aligns with the playful nature of April Fools' Day. It suggests that the entire passage is a humorous experiment rather than a serious declaration.

5. **Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust**: The mention of discussing the article on Hacker News and /r/rust is another clue. On April Fools' Day, these platforms often feature humorous or satirical posts that are quickly identified as jokes by the community.

In summary, the distinctive writing style—exaggerated praise for C++, contrarian criticism of Rust, and playful language—strongly suggests that this passage was written as an April Fools' Day joke. [end of text]
