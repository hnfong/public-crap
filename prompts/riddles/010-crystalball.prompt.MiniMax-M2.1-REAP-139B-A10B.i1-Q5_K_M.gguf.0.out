The clerk's warning is a play on the double meaning of "spirits":

1. **Supernatural meaning**: The woman likely assumes "spirits" refers to ghosts, evil entities, or supernatural forces that might be attracted to the crystal ball (like in occult traditions where crystals can attract spirits).

2. **Literal meaning**: "Spirits" also refers to alcoholic beverages (drinking spirits). The clerk is warning her to cover the crystal ball when leaving her house so it doesn't attract the attention of tipsy dr*dr* patrons who might try to buy it or cause trouble.

The humor lies in the woman's misinterpretation of the clerk's practical, real-world concern as something mystical or paranormal.
