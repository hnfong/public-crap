First, the user provides a short story: A woman buys a crystal ball from an antique shop. As she pays, the clerk says, "Be sure to cover it when you leave your house." The lady asks, "Why? Spirits?" I need to explain concisely why the clerk said this.

The key is to understand the context. The clerk is in an antique shop, selling a crystal ball, which is often associated with mysticism, fortune-telling, or supernatural elements. The clerk's warning to "cover it when you leave your house" suggests that there might be a risk if the crystal ball is left uncovered.

The lady's question, "Why? Spirits?" implies she thinks it's about spirits or ghosts. But I need to explain the clerk's reasoning concisely.

Possible reasons:

1. **Superstition or folklore**: In some beliefs, crystal balls can attract spirits or negative energies if left uncovered. The clerk might be warning based on traditional superstitions.

2. **Practical reason**: Crystal balls are reflective and can act like magnifying glasses. If left in sunlight, they could focus light and start a fire. This is a common safety tip for spherical glass objects.

3. **Preservation**: To protect the crystal ball from dust, scratches, or damage when not in use.

But the clerk specifically says "when you leave your house," which might imply that leaving it uncovered at home could cause issues. The lady's response about spirits suggests she's thinking supernaturally, but the clerk's reason might be more practical.

I recall that in many stories or warnings, crystal balls or glass spheres can cause fires if they concentrate sunlight. This is a real hazard. For example, a glass paperweight or marble left on a windowsill can ignite flammable materials.

The clerk might be hinting at this without being explicit, or the lady misinterpreted it as spirits.

The story is short, so the explanation should be concise. The user asks: "Why did the clerk say this? Explain concisely."

So, my response should directly state the reason.

Most likely, the clerk is warning about the fire hazard. Because if the crystal ball is left uncovered and in direct sunlight, it can focus the sun's rays and start a fire. This is a practical safety measure, not necessarily about spirits.

The lady's question "Spirits?" shows she's thinking of supernatural causes, but the clerk's advice is probably based on common knowledge about glass objects.

Therefore, the concise explanation: The clerk warned her to cover the crystal ball to prevent it from acting as a lens and focusing sunlight, which could cause a fire if left uncovered in a sunny spot.

I should keep it brief and to the point.
