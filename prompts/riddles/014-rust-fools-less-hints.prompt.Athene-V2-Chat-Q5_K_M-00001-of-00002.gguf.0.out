Based on the content and context of the passage, I would estimate that this was written sometime in 2022 or early 2023. Here are the key points that support this conclusion:

1. **C++20 and C++26**: The passage mentions C++20, which was finalized in 2020 and started to be adopted in 2021. It also looks forward to C++26, which is expected to be finalized in 2026. The discussion of upcoming features in C++26 suggests that the passage was written when C++26 was still in the planning stages, which aligns with 2022 or early 2023.

2. **Rust Language Features**: The passage mentions recent Rust features like generic associated types and "type alias impl trait," which were introduced in Rust 1.51 (2021) and are still being refined. The tone suggests that these features are relatively new, which fits the 2022-2023 timeframe.

3. **Community Dynamics**: The discussion of community dynamics, including the Rust community's code of conduct and the C++ community's perceived friendliness, reflects ongoing discussions and debates that were particularly prominent in the tech community around 2022-2023.

4. **Technological Context**: The mention of specific build systems (CMake, Meson, Bazel) and the state of GUI toolkits in Rust suggests a mature ecosystem, which aligns with the state of these technologies in 2022-2023.

5. **Herb Sutter's cppfront**: The reference to Herb Sutter's cppfront proposal, which gained significant attention in the C++ community around 2021-2022, further supports this timeframe.

6. **Stroustrup's Paper on Safety**: The mention of Stroustrup's paper on safety in C++ suggests a recent and relevant publication, which fits the 2022-2023 period.

Given these points, the most likely date for this passage is **2022 or early 2023**. [end of text]
