**Date: April 1 (2023)**  

**Why the hint points to April 1**

The passage is written in a deliberately provocative, over‑the‑top style that mimics the classic “April Fools” parody of a serious technical blog post. The author:

* **Exaggerates a personal “conversion” from Rust to C++** – a dramatic, almost satirical stance that is common in April Fools jokes.
* **Uses absurdly strong language** (“the Rust community can be extremely imperious… denigrating all other programming languages”) and **over‑the‑top claims** (“C++ is evolving to become safer… C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines… a safe range‑based for loop”) that sound like a tongue‑in‑cheek parody rather than a genuine technical essay.
* **Ends with a call to action** (“Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust”) – a typical April Fools post that invites the community to react and debate the “joke.”
* **Mentions a specific date‑linked event** – the “C++26” roadmap and “Herb Sutter’s cppfront” are future‑looking jokes that are often used in April Fools posts to make the piece feel timely and “future‑proof.”

All of these stylistic cues align with the tradition of April Fools Day posts, where the humor comes from presenting a wildly exaggerated or false claim as if it were a serious announcement. The distinctive, satirical tone is the “hint” that points directly to April 1. [end of text]
