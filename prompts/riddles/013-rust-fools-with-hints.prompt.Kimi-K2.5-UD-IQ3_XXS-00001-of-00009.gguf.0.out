I need to analyze this passage carefully, looking for clues about when it was written, with special attention to the "distinctive writing style" hint about a particular day and month.

Let me look for clues:

1. **Content clues about language versions:**
   - Mentions C++20 with modules "being implemented fairly soon"
   - Mentions C++26 features "looking forward"
   - Mentions "type alias impl trait" in Rust as forthcoming

2. **The distinctive writing style hint:**
   - The hint says the style is connected to "one particular day and month"
   - This strongly suggests **April Fools' Day** (April 1st)
   - The style is satirical/parody - claiming to switch from Rust to C++ for reasons that are deliberately absurd

3. **Why this reads like April Fools:**
   - The arguments are comically bad and self-contradictory:
     - Claims C++ has "rapid adoption of new features" when it's famously slow
     - Claims C++ is "free to implement backwards compatibility breaking changes" when it's actually famous for never breaking anything
     - Claims "I consider myself a good enough programmer that I can avoid writing code with safety problems" right after admitting to CVEs
     - Claims GUI crashes "are not that big a deal"
     - Claims "the C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor" (the C++ subreddit is notoriously grumpy)
     - Claims "programming languages should be free of politics" while making political statements
     - The "Stroustrup's paper on safety" praise is absurd given the context

4. **The author:**
   - This is written by **Raph Levien**, a very prominent Rust figure (creator of druid, xi-editor, etc.)
   - The "Linebender" projects are real Rust graphics projects he leads
   - Him seriously abandoning Rust for C++ would be shocking and newsworthy - perfect April Fools material

5. **Dating it more precisely:**
   - The post mentions C++20 modules "being implemented fairly soon" - C++20 was finalized in 2020, modules were still being implemented in compilers around 2021-2022
   - Mentions "type alias impl trait" as forthcoming in Rust - this was stabilized in Rust 1.75 (December 2023)
   - The post was likely written when TAIT was still nightly/unstable

Given the April Fools' nature and the technical content, this was most likely written on **April 1, 2023** or **April 1, 2022**.

Looking more carefully: The mention of C++26 features suggests this is relatively recent. The "type alias impl trait" being "forthcoming" suggests before late 2023. The mention of "Carbon language" being new (announced 2022) suggests 2023.

**My best guess: April 1, 2023**

The hint about "distinctive writing style" connected to a "particular day and month" is the key - this is classic April Fools' satire, where a prominent Rust advocate pretends to abandon Rust for C++ using deliberately absurd arguments that parody common anti-Rust talking points. [end of text]
