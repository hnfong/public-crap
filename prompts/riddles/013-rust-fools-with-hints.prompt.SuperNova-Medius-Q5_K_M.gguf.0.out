The passage was likely written in March. The distinctive writing style of the article, particularly the author's tone and the way they discuss the transition from Rust to C++, hints at a time when there was significant discussion and debate about the future of Rust and its community.

The author's frustration with Rust's limitations and their desire to move to a more mature language like C++ suggests that this was written during a period when Rust was still evolving and facing criticism. The mention of C++20 and the rapid adoption of new features in C++ also indicates that this was written around the time when C++20 was being discussed or released.

However, the key hint is the author's tone and the way they discuss the Rust community. The author's frustration and desire to distance themselves from the Rust community suggests that this was written during a time when the Rust community was facing criticism and scrutiny. This is particularly evident in the author's comments about the Rust community being "extremely imperious" and "denigrating all other programming languages."

The distinctive writing style and the author's tone suggest that this was written during a time when there was significant discussion and debate about the future of Rust and its community. This is particularly evident in the author's comments about the Rust community and their desire to move to a more mature language like C++.

The timing of these discussions and debates is often associated with the month of March, which is when many programming conferences and events take place. This is also the time when many developers and researchers are discussing the future of programming languages and technologies.

Therefore, based on the distinctive writing style and the context of the passage, it is reasonable to conclude that this was written in March. The author's tone and the way they discuss the transition from Rust to C++ suggest that this was written during a time when there was significant discussion and debate about the future of Rust and its community, which is often associated with the month of March.
