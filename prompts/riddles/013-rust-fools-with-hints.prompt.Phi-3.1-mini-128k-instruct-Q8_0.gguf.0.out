 Based on the writing style, the mention of specific C++ features, and the overall tone of the passage, I would guess that this was written around late 2021 or early 2022. The hint in the passage suggests a connection to a particular day and month, which could be interpreted as a reference to a significant event or milestone in the C++ community.

One possible connection is the release of C++20, which was officially finalized in December 2020. The author mentions looking forward to the implementation of modules, a new feature in C++20, and anticipates the arrival of C++26 with exciting new features. This suggests that the author is writing after the release of C++20 and before the anticipated release of C++26, which is expected to happen in 2023.

Additionally, the author mentions the C++ community's leadership and the work of Herb Sutter, a prominent figure in the C++ community. Sutter has been actively involved in promoting modern C++ practices and has been a strong advocate for the language's evolution. His work has been influential in shaping the direction of C++, and his involvement in the C++ community is well-known.

Considering these factors, I would estimate that the passage was written in late 2021 or early 2022, possibly around the time when C++20 was being finalized and the community was discussing the upcoming features and improvements in C++26. This timeframe aligns with the hint provided in the passage and the author's references to specific C++ features and community leaders. [end of text]
