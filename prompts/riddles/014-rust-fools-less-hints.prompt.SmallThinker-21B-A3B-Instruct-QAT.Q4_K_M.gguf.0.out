Based on the passage, the most plausible date this text was written is **2023**. Here's the reasoning:

1. **C++ Evolution Mention**: The passage references **C++20** (modules) and **C++26** (stackful coroutines, binary file initialization, etc.), which align with the actual release timelines of these standards. C++20 was finalized in 2020, and C++26 is expected to be released in 2026. The text's discussion of these features suggests it was written after 2020 but before 2026.

2. **Rust's Pace of Innovation**: The passage critiques Rust's "sedate" pace of innovation compared to C++'s rapid adoption of new features. This aligns with the perception that Rust's development has slowed in recent years (e.g., after 2020), while C++ has continued to evolve.

3. **Community Dynamics**: The author mentions the Rust community's "imperious" behavior and the C++ community's "sense of humor," which reflects a contrast between the two communities. This dynamic is consistent with the 2020s, when Rust's growth and C++'s continued relevance created a clear divide in community culture.

4. **Carbon Language Mention**: The passage references **Carbon**, a C++-compatible language proposed by Herb Sutter. Carbon was announced in 2021, and the text's reference to it as a future possibility fits within this timeframe.

5. **No Specific Dates**: The passage avoids mentioning specific years, which is typical for a general opinion piece. However, the technical details (C++ standards, Carbon) strongly point to a post-2020 context.

While the exact date is not explicitly stated, the combination of these factors makes **2023** the most reasonable estimate. The text likely reflects a perspective from the mid-2020s, when the author was actively involved in both Rust and C++ ecosystems. [end of text]
