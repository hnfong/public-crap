The clerk’s warning is a humorous misdirection: “cover it when you leave your house” sounds ominous—suggesting spirits or bad luck—but it’s actually a practical (and absurd) instruction to *cover the crystal ball* (e.g., with a cloth or box) to prevent it from being seen *from outside*—likely to avoid drawing attention or suspicion, since a crystal ball is unusual and might invite questions or theft. The woman’s “Spirits?” reply plays into the misdirection, but the real reason is mundane and logistical. [end of text]
