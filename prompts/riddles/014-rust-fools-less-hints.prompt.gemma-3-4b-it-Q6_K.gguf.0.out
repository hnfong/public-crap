Okay, this is a fun challenge! Based on the details within the passage, my best guess for the date this was written is **late 2022 or early 2023**. Here’s my reasoning:

*   **C++20 Mention:** The author specifically mentions C++20 and its new features (modules, stackful coroutines, etc.). C++20 was officially released in November 2020, but its adoption and discussion were still very prominent in 2022 and early 2023. The author’s excitement about *actually being implemented* suggests it’s a relatively recent development they’re following closely.

*   **Rust’s Pace of Innovation:** The author contrasts Rust’s slower pace of innovation with C++’s rapid evolution. They note the “type alias impl trait” as an example of combining existing features rather than introducing fundamentally new ones. This aligns with the feeling that Rust’s development was starting to slow down around this time, as the core team focused on stabilization and backwards compatibility.

*   **Zulip Reference:** The mention of a Zulip instance indicates a relatively recent use of that platform for community communication. Zulip gained popularity within the Rust community around 2021-2022.

*   **Linebender Project:** The mention of the "Linebender projects" suggests a relatively recent project, likely initiated in 2022 or 2023.

*   **Herb Sutter and cppfront:** Herb Sutter's paper on safety and the discussion of cppfront (a proposed new C++ syntax) are both concepts that gained traction and discussion in late 2022 and early 2023.

**Why not earlier?**

*   Earlier dates (e.g., 2018-2020) would be too early for the C++20 discussion and the more nuanced observations about Rust’s development.

**In conclusion, the combination of C++20 references, Rust’s evolving development pace, and the use of modern communication tools points strongly to a timeframe of late 2022 or early 2023.**

Do you want me to elaborate on any specific aspect of my reasoning, or perhaps consider alternative possibilities? [end of text]
