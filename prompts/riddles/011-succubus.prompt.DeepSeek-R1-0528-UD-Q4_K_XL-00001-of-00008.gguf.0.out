Okay, the user is asking about why warlocks in Classic WoW often use voidwalkers instead of succubi for leveling, even though succubi are generally better. The hint mentions a succubus skill that makes them more common than perceived. 

Hmm, I need to recall Classic WoW mechanics. Warlocks have different demons, each with unique abilities. Voidwalkers are tanks with high threat generation and a taunt ability, which is great for solo play because they can hold aggro, letting the warlock cast spells safely. Succubi deal more damage and have a seduction ability, which is a crowd control skill. 

The key here is the succubus's Seduction skill. In Classic, Seduction is a charm effect that breaks on damage. If a warlock uses Seduction on a mob, any damage—even from damage-over-time (DoT) spells like Corruption or Curse of Agony—will break the effect immediately. This makes it tricky to use effectively while leveling because warlocks rely heavily on DoTs for damage. 

So, even though succubi have higher DPS, the Voidwalker's consistent tanking without interfering with the warlock's rotation makes it more user-friendly. Players might find Voidwalkers simpler to manage, leading to their prevalence. The hint about the succubus skill likely refers to Seduction's downside, which isn't always obvious but affects usability. 

The user might be a Classic WoW player looking for optimization tips or curious about game mechanics. They might want to understand community trends or improve their own gameplay. By explaining the practical issue with Seduction, I can address both the riddle and their deeper interest in effective warlock strategies.

The answer is **Seduction's incompatibility with DoTs**. 

While Succubus deals more damage, her Seduction ability (charm) breaks instantly if the target takes **any** damage, including the Warlock's essential Damage-over-Time (DoT) spells like Corruption and Curse of Agony. 

This makes Seduction impractical for standard leveling/questing where DoTs are constantly applied, forcing the Warlock to either:
1.  **Not use their core DoTs** (massively reducing damage).
2.  **Break Seduction immediately** (rendering it useless).

The Voidwalker's consistent threat generation and survivability, without interfering with the Warlock's rotation, make it the simpler, more reliable choice for most players, despite the Succubus's higher potential DPS. [end of text]
