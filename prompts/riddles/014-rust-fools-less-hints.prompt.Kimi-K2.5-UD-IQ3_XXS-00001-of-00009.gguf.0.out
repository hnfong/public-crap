This passage is almost certainly **satirical** and was written on or around **April 1, 2023** (April Fools' Day).

Here's my reasoning:

1. **The author and context**: This is written by Raph Levien, a well-known figure in the Rust graphics community and creator of the Druid GUI toolkit (part of the Linebender collective). The idea that he would genuinely abandon Rust for C++ is highly implausible given his deep investment in Rust's ecosystem.

2. **Absurd arguments**: The arguments are deliberately ridiculous:
   - Praising C++'s "rapid adoption of new features" and "excellent leadership" while criticizing Rust's pace
   - Claiming C++20 modules will be "implemented fairly soon" (they were already implemented in major compilers by 2023)
   - The "I'm a good enough programmer" safety argument is a famous meme/mockery of C++ programmers
   - The claim that "programming languages should be free of politics" while dismissing diversity efforts is a parody of certain tech culture war positions
   - The C++ subreddit being "well known for their sense of humor" is clearly sarcastic

3. **Specific dated references**:
   - References C++26 features as upcoming (written in 2023, looking forward)
   - Mentions Carbon language (announced 2022, relevant in 2023)
   - References Herb Sutter's cppfront (active in 2022-2023)

4. **The tell**: The post ends with "Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust" — this exact phrasing and the inflammatory nature of the content is characteristic of April Fools' posts designed to generate maximum engagement and outrage before revealing the joke.

Raph Levien has a history of thoughtful, nuanced technical writing. This post's exaggerated, trolling tone is completely out of character for a genuine technical announcement, but perfectly matches April Fools' tradition in the Rust community (which has a history of elaborate yearly jokes, like the "Rust 2.0" announcements).

The date was **April 1, 2023**. [end of text]
