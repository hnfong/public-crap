**Best guess: Written sometime between late 2023 and early 2024.**

**Reasoning:**

1.  **The "Linebender" Projects:** The passage mentions "Linebender projects." A quick search reveals that "Linebender" is the name of a group of projects (like "Parley" and "Xilem") focused on text layout and GUI in Rust, led by a developer named "Raph Levien." Raph Levien is a well-known figure in the graphics and typography world, having created the "Inconsolata" font and worked on Google's "Skia" graphics library. The existence of these projects is a relatively recent development in the Rust ecosystem, placing the context firmly in the last few years.

2.  **The C++ Evolution Timeline:** The author is very excited about C++20 and C++26. C++20 was finalized in December 2020, and its major features (like modules) were being implemented by major compilers (GCC, Clang, MSVC) throughout 2021-2023. The mention of C++26 is a strong clue. C++26 is the next major standard after C++23 (which was finalized in 2023). The features the author lists for C++26 (stackful coroutines, safe range-based for loops) are part of the ongoing C++26 working group's discussions and proposals. This suggests the author is writing from a perspective where C++20 is a recent, exciting development and C++26 is the near future, which aligns with the state of the C++ standard in 2023-2024.

3.  **The Rust Evolution Context:** The author criticizes Rust's slower pace of innovation, specifically mentioning "generic associated types" (GATs) and "type alias impl trait." GATs were stabilized in Rust 1.65, which was released in November 2022. The author describes these features as "making combinations of existing features work as expected," which is a common sentiment after a major, complex feature is finally stabilized. The mention of "type alias impl trait" (which is still a work-in-progress feature, often referred to as "TAIT") further suggests a post-2022 context.

4.  **The Tone and Specificity:** The passage reads like a personal blog post or a detailed forum post, not a formal announcement. The specific, technical details about build systems, language features, and community dynamics feel like someone writing from the trenches of software development, reacting to the current state of both languages. The tone of frustration and the desire for a "mature, production-ready language" is a sentiment that has become more common in the Rust community as it has matured and moved beyond its initial, rapid-growth phase.

**Conclusion:**
The combination of the specific, recent technical references (C++20/26, stabilized Rust GATs), the context of the "Linebender" projects, and the overall tone strongly points to a date in the latter half of 2023 or the very beginning of 2024. The author is writing from a perspective where the "newness" of C++20 is still fresh, and the future of C++26 is a topic of active discussion, while Rust's major recent features are seen as incremental improvements.
