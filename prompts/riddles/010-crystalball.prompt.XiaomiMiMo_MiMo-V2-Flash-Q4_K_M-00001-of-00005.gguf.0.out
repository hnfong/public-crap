<think>First, the story is about a woman buying a crystal ball from an antique shop. The clerk tells her to cover it when she leaves her house. She asks why, suggesting "Spirits?" as a possible reason.

I need to explain why the clerk said this concisely. The key is to understand the context of a crystal ball. Crystal balls are often associated with fortune-telling or divination in folklore and superstition. But here, the clerk is specifically warning her to cover it when leaving the house.

This might be related to a superstition about crystal balls being used for scrying, which means seeing visions or spirits. If the crystal ball is uncovered, it might attract spirits or allow them to see into the world, or something like that.

But the lady asks "Spirits?" which implies she thinks it might be about spirits. So, the clerk's warning could be to prevent spirits from being drawn to the crystal ball or from using it to interact with the living.

Another angle: in some cultures, there's a belief that mirrors or reflective surfaces can capture souls or allow spirits to enter. Crystal balls are reflective, so similar superstitions might apply.

The clerk says "Be sure to cover it when you leave your house." Why when leaving the house? That might be to avoid exposing it to the outside world where spirits might be present.

Perhaps it's to prevent the crystal ball from being seen by others, but that seems less likely since she's leaving the shop, and covering it might be for protection.

I recall a specific superstition: in some traditions, it's believed that if you leave a mirror uncovered, it can allow spirits to enter or see you. But here it's a crystal ball.

Crystal balls are used for fortune-telling, and if uncovered, it might be used by spirits to spy on the living or something.

But let's think about why the warning is specifically when leaving the house. Maybe it's to avoid the crystal ball reflecting the outside world and attracting unwanted attention from spirits.

Perhaps there's a belief that crystal balls can store energy or souls if left uncovered in public.

I need to explain this concisely. So, the reason is likely based on superstition that uncovered crystal balls can attract spirits or allow them to see into our world, so covering it protects the owner from spiritual interference.

The lady asks "Why? Spirits?" which directly suggests she thinks it's about spirits. So, the clerk's warning is probably to prevent spirits from being drawn to the crystal ball or from using it to manifest.

In many stories, antique items, especially those used for divination, are thought to be haunted or to have trapped spirits. So, covering the crystal ball might be to prevent any trapped spirits from escaping or from being activated by exposure to the outside world.

But the warning is when she leaves her house, not when she's inside. Why when leaving? Maybe to avoid bringing it into public where spirits might be more prevalent, or to avoid it reflecting the sky or something.

Another idea: in some beliefs, leaving a mirror uncovered at night can allow spirits to enter through it. But here, it's a crystal ball, and she's leaving the house, so it might be about covering it during the day when she's out.

Perhaps it's to avoid the crystal ball being seen by others who might have ill intentions or who might curse it.

But the lady's question "Spirits?" indicates that the clerk's warning is associated with spirits.

So, I think the most straightforward explanation is that the clerk believes that if the crystal ball is uncovered, it might attract spirits or allow them to see the living, leading to potential haunting or misfortune.

Therefore, the reason is to protect her from spiritual entities by covering the crystal ball when she is outside her house.

Concisely, I should say: The clerk said this because of a superstition that uncovered crystal balls can attract spirits or allow them to enter our world, so covering it prevents spiritual interference.

But let's make it even more concise.

Final answer: The clerk warned her to cover the crystal ball to prevent spirits from being drawn to it or using it to see into the living world, based on superstition.</think>The clerk's warning is based on a superstition that an uncovered crystal ball can attract spirits or allow them to see into the living world, potentially leading to haunting or misfortune. Covering it protects the owner from spiritual interference when leaving the house. [end of text]
