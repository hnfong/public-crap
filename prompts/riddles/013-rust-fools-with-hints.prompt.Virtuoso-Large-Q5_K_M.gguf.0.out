The passage is likely written on or around April 1st, which is April Fool's Day. Hereâ€™s how the distinctive writing style and content of the article point to this conclusion:

1. **Tone and Content**: The article has a tone that is both serious and slightly exaggerated, which is a hallmark of April Fool's Day pranks. The author presents a series of arguments that, while plausible, are also somewhat hyperbolic and play into common stereotypes and debates within the programming community.

2. **Controversial Claims**: The author makes several controversial claims that are designed to provoke strong reactions:
   - The assertion that the Rust community is "extremely imperious" and "denigrating all other programming languages."
   - The claim that the author is a good enough programmer to avoid safety issues, despite having been responsible for CVEs.
   - The suggestion that memory safety problems are overblown, especially in the context of GUI applications.
   - The idea that the C++ community is "much nicer and friendlier" and that the C++ subreddit is known for its sense of humor, which is a stark contrast to the often serious and technical nature of such communities.

3. **Community and Social Media References**: The article mentions social media and community dynamics in a way that is designed to be provocative and to elicit strong reactions, which is a common tactic in April Fool's Day pranks.

4. **Technical Details**: The technical details and future projections (e.g., C++26 features, Herb Sutter's cppfront proposal) are presented with a level of certainty that is unusual for such speculative topics. This adds to the plausibility of the article, making it more convincing as a prank.

5. **Call to Action**: The article ends with a call to action, inviting readers to join the Zulip instance and help with the C++ rewrite. This is a common element in April Fool's Day pranks, where the prankster tries to get the audience to engage in some way, often leading to a reveal or a humorous outcome.

6. **Discussion Platforms**: The mention of discussing the article on Hacker News and /r/rust is another clue. These platforms are known for their active and sometimes skeptical communities, making them ideal for spreading and discussing April Fool's Day pranks.

Given these elements, the article is likely a well-crafted April Fool's Day prank, designed to play on the tensions and debates within the programming community, particularly between Rust and C++ enthusiasts. The distinctive writing style, which balances plausibility with exaggeration, is a clear indicator that the article was written on or around April 1st. [end of text]
