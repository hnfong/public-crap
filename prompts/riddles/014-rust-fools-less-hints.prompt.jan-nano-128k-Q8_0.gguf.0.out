Okay, let's try to figure out when this passage was written. The user is talking about their experience with Rust and the Rust community, and they're considering moving their projects to C++. The key clues here are the specific versions of C++ and Rust mentioned, as well as the features they're discussing.

First, the passage mentions C++20 and C++26. C++20 was standardized in December 2020, so if the author is talking about C++20 features being implemented soon, that would make sense if the passage was written around 2021 or 2022. Then, C++26 is a future version, but the next major C++ standard after C++20 is C++23, which was released in 2022. Wait, but the user says C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, etc. That might be a bit confusing. Wait, actually, the C++ standards are released every 3 years, so C++20 was 2020, then C++23 in 2022, and C++26 would be 2026. But the author is talking about C++26 as a future version, so if the passage was written in 2022, that would be accurate. However, the author might be using a hypothetical future version, but the mention of C++20 being implemented soon suggests that the passage was written before C++20 was finalized. Wait, but C++20 was finalized in 2020, so if the author is talking about it being implemented soon, that would be in 2021 or 2022. 

Then, the passage mentions "type alias impl trait" as a forthcoming feature in Rust. I need to check when that feature was introduced. "Type alias impl trait" is a feature that was introduced in Rust 1.60, which was released in May 2020. So if the author is talking about it being a forthcoming feature, that would mean the passage was written before May 2020. But wait, the author is saying that Rust's pace of innovation has slowed down, and that the features they mention are more about combining existing features rather than new ones. So if the author is talking about features that were already in Rust 1.60, then the passage was written before that. But the author also mentions that the Rust community is demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust, which might be a more recent phenomenon. 

Another clue is the mention of the C++ subreddit being known for its sense of humor. The C++ subreddit has been around for a while, but maybe the author is referring to a specific time when the community was more active in that way. Also, the author is looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite and mentions joining their Zulip instance. That might be a recent development, but Zulip instances are often created for specific projects, so maybe the author is talking about a project that's active in the current time frame.

Wait, the author also mentions that the C++ core guidelines are useful, even if they're honored in the breach. The C++ Core Guidelines were first published in 2017 by Bjarne Stroustrup and Herb Sutter. So if the author is referring to that, it's possible the passage was written after that, but before the author had a strong opinion about the community's behavior. 

The passage also talks about the Rust community being "extremely imperious" and demanding projects be rewritten in Rust. I remember that in the early 2020s, there was some criticism of the Rust community for being too demanding, but maybe that's more recent. However, the author is saying that they want to move to C++ because of the community being friendlier. 

Putting this together: The author is comparing C++20 features (which were released in 2020) and the Rust features like "type alias impl trait" (introduced in 2020). If the passage was written in 2021 or 2022, the author would be talking about C++20 being implemented soon, which is accurate because C++20 was released in 2020, but the author might be referring to the adoption of C++20 features in projects. Also, the author is talking about the C++ community being more friendly, which might be a more recent observation. 

But wait, the author is also talking about the Rust community's code of conduct and policies promoting diversity. That's a point that's been around for a while, but maybe the author is referring to the current state of the Rust community. 

Another angle: The author mentions that the Rust community is "extremely imperious" and constantly demanding projects be rewritten in Rust. That might be a more recent critique, perhaps from around 2021 onwards. 

Also, the author is looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite, which might be a current project. If the author is writing this in 2022, then the C++26 features are still in the future, which is correct. 

So, considering all these points, the passage was likely written in 2021 or 2022. But the mention of C++20 and C++26, and the Rust features like "type alias impl trait" (which was in 2020), suggests that the author is writing in 2021 or 2022. However, the author might have written it in 2021 when C++20 was just released, and the C++26 features were still in the future. 

Alternatively, if the author is talking about C++26 as a future version, but the C++20 was already released, then the passage is from 2021 or 2022. 

Another possible clue is the mention of "the C++ core guidelines are useful, even if they’re honored in the breach." The C++ Core Guidelines were first published in 2017, so that's not a recent thing. 

The author also mentions Herb Sutter's paper on safety. I think Herb Sutter has written several papers on C++. The one about safety might be from around 2019 or 2020. 

Putting all together, the passage was written in 2021 or 2022. But the author is talking about the Rust community being "extremely imperious" which might be a more recent observation. Also, the author is looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite, which could be a current project. 

But wait, the author is also talking about the Rust community's code of conduct. That's been a thing since 2017, but maybe the author is referring to the current state of the Rust community. 

Alternatively, the author might be writing in 2020, but that would be before C++20 was finalized. However, the author is talking about C++20 features being implemented soon, which would be accurate in 2020. But the author is also talking about the Rust community being "extremely imperious" which might be a more recent critique. 

Hmm. Maybe the passage was written in 2021. Because C++20 was released in 2020, but the author is talking about the C++26 features as future, which would be 2026. So if the author is writing in 2021, that's correct. Also, the "type alias impl trait" was introduced in 2020, so if the author is talking about it being a forthcoming feature, that would be in 2021. 

But the author is also talking about the Rust community being "extremely imperious" which might be a more recent thing. So maybe the passage was written in 2021 or 2022. 

Another possible clue is the mention of the C++ subreddit being known for humor. That's a known fact, but maybe the author is referring to a specific time when that was more prominent. 

Alternatively, the author might be writing in 2022, when the Rust community was still active in certain ways, but the C++ community was more established. 

I think the most likely answer is 2021 or 2022. But since the author is talking about C++20 being implemented soon, which was released in 2020, but the author might have written it in 2021 when the adoption was still in progress. Also, the author is talking about the C++ community being friendlier, which might be a more recent observation. 

So, the best guess is around 2021 or 2022. But the exact date? The passage mentions "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines..." which is a future version. The next C++ standard after C++20 is C++23, which was released in 2022. So if the author is talking about C++26, that would be 2026, but the author is talking about it as a future version, so the passage was written before 2026. 

But the author is also talking about the Rust community's behavior, which might be more recent. So if the passage was written in 2021, that would make sense. Alternatively, maybe the author is writing in 2022, when the Rust community was still facing some challenges. 

I think the most probable date is 2021. Because C++20 was released in 2020, and the author is talking about it being implemented soon, which would be in 2021. The "type alias impl trait" was introduced in 2020, so the author is talking about it as a forthcoming feature, which would be in 2021. The author is also talking about the Rust community being "extremely imperious," which might be a more recent critique. 

So, the answer is likely 202
