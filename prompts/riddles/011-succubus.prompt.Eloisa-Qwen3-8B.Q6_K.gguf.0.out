Okay, the user is asking about why most Warlocks in Classic WoW are seen with Voidwalkers instead of Succubus, even though Succubus is better for leveling and quests. The hint points to a skill that makes Succubus more common than they seem.

First, I need to recall the mechanics of Warlock pets in Classic WoW. Warlocks have two main pets: Voidwalker and Succubus. Voidwalker is a demon that's good for crowd control and AoE, while Succubus is a demon hunter that's better for soloing and quests because it can use Soul Link to stay close to the player.

The hint mentions a skill that makes Succubus more common. Wait, Soul Link is the key here. When a Succubus uses Soul Link, it becomes a permanent pet, meaning it stays with the player even when they're not actively summoning it. This makes Succubus appear more frequently in gameplay, especially during leveling and quests where players might not always be summoning their pets.

On the other hand, Voidwalker is a summoned pet that disappears after a certain time or when the player dismounts. So, even though Voidwalker is a strong pet, it's not always present, making it seem less common in the game world. Players might see more Succubus because they're constantly with the player, while Voidwalker is only summoned when needed.

So, the answer should focus on Soul Link as the skill that makes Succubus more prevalent in the player's experience, leading to the perception that more Warlocks use Succubus, even though Voidwalker is also a common choice.

Because Succubus can use **Soul Link**, permanently bonding them to the player, making them constantly present during leveling and quests. Voidwalkers, being summoned pets, disappear when not actively used. [end of text]
