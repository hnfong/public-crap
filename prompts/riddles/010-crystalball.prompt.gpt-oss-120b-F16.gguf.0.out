<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer: why did the clerk say "Be sure to cover it when you leave your house." The lady asks "Why? Spirits?" The answer: because the crystal ball is a "ball" that can be used as a crystal ball for fortune telling, but also it's a "ball" that can be used as a "crystal ball" but also a "crystal ball" can be used as a "ball" for playing? Or maybe it's a "crystal ball" that is a "ball" that can be used as a "crystal ball" for fortune telling, but also it's a "ball" that can be used as a "crystal ball" for "spirit" like "spirit" meaning "alcohol"? Wait, "cover it when you leave your house" might refer to "cover your crystal ball with a cloth to protect it from dust, but also to hide it from spirits that might be attracted to it." But the lady asks "Why? Spirits?" So the clerk might be referencing "spirit" as in "alcoholic spirits" like "liquor"? Or "spirit" as in "ghosts"? The clerk says "Be sure to cover it when you leave your house." The lady asks "Why? Spirits?" The answer: Because the crystal ball is a "ball" that can be used as a "crystal ball" for fortune telling, but also it's a "ball" that can be used as a "ball" for "spirit" like "spirit level"? Hmm.

Maybe it's a pun: "cover it when you leave your house" means "cover your crystal ball with a cloth when you leave your house, because you might be tempted to look into it and see the future, which could cause you to be late."
