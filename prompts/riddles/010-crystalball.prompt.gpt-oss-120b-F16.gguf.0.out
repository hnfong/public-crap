<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer: why did the clerk say "Be sure to cover it when you leave your house." The lady asks "Why? Spirits?" So the clerk's warning is about something else. The story: woman buys a crystal ball from antique shop. Clerk says cover it when you leave your house. Why? Probably because the crystal ball is a window to the outside world, and if left uncovered, it will attract spirits or something? But the lady asks "Why? Spirits?" The clerk's answer likely is about sunlight: the crystal ball can focus sunlight like a magnifying glass and cause fire. So you need to cover it to avoid it focusing sunlight and causing a fire. Or maybe it's about privacy: the crystal ball can see through walls, so you need to cover it to avoid being seen by others? Or it's about the ball being a "scrying" device that can be used by spirits to see inside your house, so you need to cover it to prevent them from seeing you. But the lady asks "Why? Spirits?" implying she thinks it's about spirits. The clerk's answer is something else.

The clue: "Be sure to cover it when you leave your house." Could be about the ball being a "lens" that can focus sunlight and cause a fire. So you need to cover it when you leave the house to avoid it focusing sunlight onto something flammable. That is a common safety warning for magnifying glasses, telescopes, etc. The clerk says "cover it when you leave your house" meaning when you leave your house, you might be away, and the ball could cause a fire if left uncovered in sunlight. So the clerk warns to cover it to prevent a fire. The lady asks "Why? Spirits?" She thinks it's about supernatural. The clerk's answer: "Because it can focus sunlight and start a fire." That's concise.

Alternatively, maybe it's about the ball being a "window" to the outside world, and if uncovered, it will attract the attention of the "spirit of the house" that will try to escape. But likely it's about fire hazard.

Thus answer: The clerk warns because the crystal ball acts like a convex lens; left uncovered in sunlight it can concentrate rays and ignite flammable material, causing a house fire. So you must cover it when you leave.

Thus answer concisely: The clerk's warning is practical, not supernatural: a crystal ball can focus sunlight like a magnifying glass, so if left uncovered it could start a fire. Therefore cover it when you leave the house.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>The clerk’s warning isn’t about ghosts at all – it’s about fire safety. A crystal ball is essentially a large convex lens. In direct sunlight it can concentrate the sun’s rays to a tiny, extremely hot spot, just like a magnifying glass. If the ball is left uncovered on a windowsill or in a sunny room while the owner is out, that focused beam can ignite curtains, books, furniture, or any other flammable material and set the house ablaze. So the clerk tells her to “cover it when you leave your house” to prevent the ball from acting as an accidental solar‑furnace. [end of text]
