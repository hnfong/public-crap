Based on the content of the passage, here are some clues that help to estimate the date it was written:

1. **Mention of Specific Rust Features**: The author mentions "generic associated types" and "type alias impl trait" as recent features in Rust. These features were introduced in Rust 1.51 (released in April 2021) and Rust 1.65 (released in October 2022), respectively.

2. **C++20 and Future Versions**: The author discusses C++20 features like modules and looks forward to C++26 features such as stackful coroutines and safe range-based for loops. C++20 was finalized in December 2020, and discussions about C++26 would likely start around 2023.

3. **Cppfront and Carbon**: The mention of "cppfront" by Herb Sutter and the "Carbon language" suggests a timeframe when these were topics of discussion. Cppfront was proposed around 2017-2018, and Carbon is a more recent initiative, announced in 2022.

4. **Community and Social Media References**: The author's comments about the Rust community and social media dynamics are reflective of ongoing discussions and criticisms that have been prevalent in the tech community in recent years.

5. **Zulip Instance**: The mention of a Zulip instance for collaboration is a modern reference, as Zulip gained popularity in the late 2010s and early 2020s.

6. **Hacker News and Reddit**: The references to discussing on Hacker News and /r/rust are indicative of a time when these platforms were actively used for such discussions, which is consistent with the late 2010s to early 2020s.

Considering these points, the most likely timeframe for when this passage was written is **late 2022 to early 2023**. The specific mentions of Rust features and the forward-looking comments about C++26 and Carbon suggest a time close to the present but not too far in the past. [end of text]
