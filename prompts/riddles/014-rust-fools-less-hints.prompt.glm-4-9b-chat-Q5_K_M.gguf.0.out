Based on the content of the passage, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact date, but we can make some educated guesses:

1. **Rust and C++ Community References**: The author mentions the Rust community and C++ community, suggesting that the passage was written after both communities had gained significant traction. Rust was first announced in 2010, but it started gaining popularity around 2015. C++ has been around much longer, but the passage seems to reference a more recent era of both languages.

2. **Language Evolution**: The author discusses the evolution of both Rust and C++, mentioning specific features like C++20 modules and Rust's generic associated types. C++20 was released in December 2020, and Rust 1.51, which introduced generic associated types, was released in March 2021. This suggests the passage was written after these features were introduced.

3. **Build Systems and Tools**: The author mentions Cargo, Bazel, CMake, Meson, and Autotools, indicating familiarity with a range of build systems. The passage seems to be written after these tools had been in use for a while, which could be around the mid-2010s.

4. **CVEs and Android**: The author references CVEs and Android, which implies that the passage was written after the CVE system was established and Android had become a significant platform, which would be after 2008.

5. **Community Dynamics**: The author comments on the Rust community's perceived behavior, which suggests that the passage was written after the Rust community had become well-known and had developed its own culture.

Considering these points, a best guess for when the passage was written would be around 2021 or 2022. This is because it references features and tools that were in use or had been introduced around that time, and it reflects a perspective that seems to have emerged after the languages and communities had matured to a certain extent.

However, without a specific reference to a particular event or release that the author could be directly referencing, this is still an educated guess. [end of text]
