Okay, this is a clever puzzle! The key lies in the distinctive writing style and the hint about a specific day and month. The author's tone is very particular: a mix of technical frustration, contrarianism, and a somewhat... *unique* perspective on community and politics. This style is strongly associated with **April 1st**.

Here's how I arrive at that conclusion, using the hint and textual clues:

**The Hint & The Style:** The hint explicitly mentions a distinctive writing style connected to a specific day and month. The most famous day for distinctive, often contrarian, and sometimes provocative writing is **April Fool's Day (April 1st)**. The author's arguments are presented with a straight face, but many of them are quite eyebrow-raising and counter to common sentiment in the Rust and C++ communities. This is classic April Fool's Day material – a serious-looking piece that's actually a bit of a troll or thought experiment.

**Textual Clues Supporting April 1st:**

1.  **The Core Argument:** The central premise – a seasoned Rust developer *choosing* to move to C++ for its maturity and safety (despite C++'s historical reputation) – is inherently provocative. It's the kind of statement designed to spark debate and incredulity, perfect for a day when people expect to be surprised.
2.  **The "Safety" Argument:** The author's dismissal of memory safety concerns ("I'm a good enough programmer," "dangers are overblown," "it's not fundamentally different than logic errors") is a deliberately contrarian take. It's the kind of statement that would be instantly dissected and mocked on April 1st.
3.  **The Community Critique:** The characterization of the Rust community as "imperious" and the C++ community as "nicer and friendlier" (with a nod to the C++ subreddit's "sense of humor") is a caricature. It's a playful jab at the stereotypes of both communities.
4.  **The Politics Take:** The assertion that "programming languages should be free of politics" and the dismissal of diversity concerns ("we have moved beyond prejudice and discrimination") is a deliberately provocative statement that would be highly controversial and likely intended as satire.
5.  **The "Looking Forward" Section:** The enthusiasm for C++26 features and the mention of "cppfront" and "Carbon" (which was still very early in development at the time) feels like a slightly exaggerated, optimistic view of C++'s future.
6.  **The Conclusion:** The call for help with a "C++ rewrite" and the invitation to a Zulip instance feels like a setup for a joke or a community reaction.

**Dating the Article:**

*   **Carbon Language:** The mention of Carbon as a "new C++ compatible language" places the article *after* Google's announcement of Carbon in July 2022.
*   **C++26 Features:** The specific features listed for C++26 (stackful coroutines, binary file embedding, safe range-based for loop) were still under discussion and not finalized at the time. This suggests the article was written before the finalization of C++26 features, which happened in late 2023/early 2024.
*   **Async Rust:** The reference to "async" as a "major effort" that has "landed" suggests the author is writing after Rust's async/await features were stabilized (which was in Rust 1.37.0, released in November 2018, but the ecosystem was still maturing).

Considering these factors, the most likely date is **April 1st, 2023**. This date satisfies all the clues:

*   It's April 1st, aligning
