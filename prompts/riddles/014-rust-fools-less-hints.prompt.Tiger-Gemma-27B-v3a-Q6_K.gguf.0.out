This passage was almost certainly written in **late 2023 or early 2024**. Here's the reasoning, broken down into key clues:

*   **C++20 Modules:** The author explicitly mentions looking forward to C++20 modules "being implemented fairly soon." While C++20 was finalized in 2020, full module support in major compilers (MSVC, GCC, Clang) only became practical and widely adopted in late 2023 and early 2024. The phrasing suggests the author is *anticipating* widespread use, not reflecting on it as a settled matter.
*   **C++26 Speculation:** The author discusses potential features in C++26 (stackful coroutines, embedded binary files, safe range-based for loops). The C++26 standardization process was actively underway in late 2023/early 2024, with proposals being refined and debated. The level of detail suggests the author is following the standardization process closely.
*   **Carbon Language Mention:** The reference to the C++-compatible Carbon language is a strong indicator. Carbon was publicly announced by Microsoft in February 2024. The author's inclusion of it suggests the writing occurred after this announcement.
*   **Rust's "Sedate" Pace:** The complaint about Rust's innovation slowing down, with generic associated types and type alias impl trait as examples, aligns with the sentiment around Rust's stabilization focus in late 2023/early 2024. These features were finalized and landed around that time.
*   **Herb Sutter's Paper:** The mention of Bjarne Stroustrup's paper on safety and Herb Sutter's cppfront proposal places the writing in a period where these discussions were prominent in the C++ community.
*   **Zulip Instance:** The call to join a Zulip instance suggests a modern, tech-focused project. Zulip's popularity has grown in recent years, making it a plausible communication platform for a project in this timeframe.
*   **Hacker News and /r/rust:** The mention of these platforms as discussion venues is consistent with the current tech discourse landscape.

Given these converging clues, the most likely timeframe for this passage is **late 2023 to early 2024**. The author is clearly engaged in both the Rust and C++ communities, following recent developments in both languages, and making a deliberate decision to switch projects to C++ based on perceived advantages in maturity, innovation speed, and build system flexibility.
