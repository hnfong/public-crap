To make an educated guess about when this passage was written, let's analyze the content and context provided:

1. **Mention of C++20 and C++26**: The author discusses C++20 and mentions that C++26 is likely to have several new features. C++20 was officially published in December 2020, and C++26 is scheduled for publication in December 2026. Given that the author is looking forward to C++26, it's likely that the passage was written sometime before C++26 was finalized, which would be before 2026.

2. **Rust Features**: The author mentions that Rust's pace of innovation has slowed down, with features like async and generic associated types being highlighted. Generic associated types were stabilized in Rust 1.51, released in May 2021. The author also mentions that the "type alias impl trait" is similar, which was stabilized in Rust 1.60, released in July 2022. This suggests the passage was written after these features were stabilized but before C++26 was finalized.

3. **Community Dynamics**: The author mentions the Rust community's code of conduct and policies promoting diversity, which have been in place for several years. However, the author's perspective on these policies is somewhat critical, suggesting a time when these policies were well-established but possibly controversial.

4. **Linebender Projects**: The author mentions the Linebender projects and their transition to C++. Linebender is a project focused on 2D graphics, and the transition to C++ is a significant decision. Given the context and the features discussed, it's reasonable to assume this transition was being considered or planned around the time of writing.

Considering all these points, the most likely time frame for this passage to have been written is between 2021 and 2023. This period aligns with the stabilization of key Rust features, the anticipation of C++26, and the ongoing discussions about community dynamics in the Rust community.

Therefore, my best guess is that this passage was written in **2022**. [end of text]
