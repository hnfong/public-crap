Based on the passage, I would make the following educated guess about the date it was written:

**2023 or early 2024**

### Reasoning:
1. **C++ Evolution and Features**: The passage mentions C++20 and C++26, which are real features. C++20 was released in January 2020, and C++26 is still in development but is expected to be released by 2026. The discussion of C++26 features suggests the author is familiar with the upcoming standard and is likely writing about it in the near future.

2. **Rust's Slower Innovation Pace**: The author compares Rust's innovation pace to C++'s, noting that Rust's recent advancements (e.g., async) have been more incremental. This tone suggests the author is observing Rust's current state and its trajectory, which aligns with the general perception of Rust's slower pace of feature adoption compared to C++.

3. **Community and Perception of Rust**: The author expresses dissatisfaction with Rust's community's demands for projects to be rewritten in Rust and their perceived "imperious" nature. This sentiment is likely rooted in recent discussions and debates within the Rust community, which have been active in the past few years.

4. **Call to Action and Zulip Instance**: The mention of a Zulip instance and a call to discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust suggests the author is actively engaging with the Rust community and C++ community, which are active forums and platforms.

5. **General Context**: The passage reflects a thoughtful and critical perspective on both Rust and C++, which is common in the developer community. Given the timing of C++26 and Rust's current state, it is plausible that this writing was done in 2023 or early 2024.

### Additional Notes:
- The author's mention of "CVEs" and their personal experience suggests they are experienced developers, likely with a background in both Rust and C++.
- The tone of the passage is analytical and opinionated, which is typical for developers discussing language evolution and community dynamics.

In summary, the most likely date for this passage to have been written is **2023 or early 2024**, given the references to C++26, Rust's current state, and the active nature of the communities involved.
