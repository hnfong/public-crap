Based on the passage, I would estimate that this was written sometime between 2020 and 2022. Here are some key points that support this estimation:

1. The author mentions Rust's async features and generic associated types (GATs) as recent developments. Rust's async/await feature was stabilized in Rust 1.39 (released in October 2019), and GATs were introduced in Rust 1.51 (released in February 2021).

2. The author discusses C++20 and its modules feature, which was standardized in December 2019 and is expected to be implemented soon. This suggests that the passage was written after the standardization of C++20.

3. The author mentions C++26 as a future version, which would be the next major version after C++23. C++23 is expected to be finalized in 2023, so the passage was likely written before that.

4. The author refers to the Rust community's code of conduct and diversity policies, which have been a topic of discussion and debate in the Rust community since around 2018.

5. The mention of the Carbon language, which is a new language being developed by Microsoft, suggests that the passage was written after the announcement of Carbon in 2020.

Taking all these factors into account, it is reasonable to conclude that the passage was written sometime between 2020 and 2022. [end of text]
