Seduce.

The succubus's Seduce ability (a 10-second charm) is highly effective for crowd control during solo play, making it invaluable for leveling and questing—yet many players avoid it due to its *perceived* immorality or fear of PvP disruption, leading them to default to the "safer" voidwalker. Thus, while objectively better, the succubus is *seen* less because of that one skill's stigma. [end of text]
