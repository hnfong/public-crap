The clerk said this as a joke or a play on words, since the crystal ball is a round, transparent object that can be confused with a Christmas ornament ball. The lady might have misunderstood the clerk's statement, thinking it was a serious warning about spirits or supernatural beings.

Here's a more detailed explanation:

The crystal ball is a round, transparent object that can be confused with a Christmas ornament ball. The clerk might have noticed this resemblance and made a play on words, suggesting that the woman should cover the crystal ball when she leaves her house, as if it were a fragile ornament. The woman, however, might have misunderstood the clerk's statement, thinking that the crystal ball itself was haunted or possessed by spirits, and that she needed to cover it to protect herself from supernatural harm.

In summary, the clerk's statement was likely intended as a joke or a play on words, but the woman may have misinterpreted it as a serious warning about spirits or supernatural beings.
