Based on the passage, this was written around **mid-2020**. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Rust Ecosystem Frustrations**: The author mentions "the near-monoculture of the Cargo build system" and frustration with Rust's "commitment to not break existing code (enacted by the edition mechanism)." This reflects a common sentiment during the Rust 2018 edition transition period (2018-2020), when breaking changes were limited.

2. **C++20 and C++26 Mentions**: The passage references C++20's modules and C++26's features (stackful coroutines, etc.). C++20 was finalized in **December 2020**, and C++26 was still speculative at the time (it was officially ratified in **March 2024**). The author seems to be looking ahead to C++26's features, suggesting this was written **before** C++20's release but after its announcement (likely **mid-2020**, when C++20's feature set was finalized).

3. **Community Tone**: The criticism of the Rust community ("extremely imperious," "demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust") aligns with the heightened tensions during the **Rust 2021 edition** debates and the broader "Rust vs. C++" discourse of **2020-2021**.

4. **Historical Context**: The passage reflects a moment when C++ was seen as stagnant (pre-C++20), while Rust was gaining traction but facing growing pains. The author’s frustration with Rust’s "sedate" pace and C++'s "rapid adoption" of new features (like modules) fits the **2020-2021** window.

Thus, the most likely date is **mid-2020**, when C++20 was finalized but not yet released, and the Rust community was grappling with its next steps. [end of text]
