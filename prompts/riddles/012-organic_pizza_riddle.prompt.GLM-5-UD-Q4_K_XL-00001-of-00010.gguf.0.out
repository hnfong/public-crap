Based on the scenario, here is what happened:

### What did Bob eat?
Bob ate a **pizza**.

Here is the translation of his fancy description:
*   **"Aged organic milk"** refers to **cheese**.
*   **"Seasoned tomato purée"** refers to **pizza sauce**.
*   **"Baked whole wheat"** refers to the **crust**.

### What happened?
Bob tried to make his lunch sound sophisticated, artisanal, and incredibly healthy by using deconstructed, gourmet terminology. However, when he sent the photo, Alice immediately recognized it as just a regular (and likely greasy or messy) slice of pizza. The contrast between his elaborate description and the visual reality of fast food prompted her confused reaction ("wtf").

### Was it healthy?
**Technically, yes (or at least healthier than average).**
Bob wasn't lying about the ingredients. By specifying "organic" and "whole wheat," he chose better options than the standard processed alternatives. Whole wheat crust provides more fiber than white flour, and organic ingredients avoid certain pesticides and additives. However, Alice's reaction implies that despite these "healthy" qualifiers, it was still pizza—a food typically associated with being indulgent or "junk food," regardless of how organic the cheese is.
