The passage was likely written on **December 25th**.

### Explanation:

The hint is subtle but cleverly embedded in the **distinctive writing style** of the article. The author uses a **very formal, almost academic tone**, and the structure of the article is **logical and analytical**, with sections like "Choice of build systems", "Safety", "Language evolution", and "Community". This is not unusual for a technical blog post, but the **real clue lies in the conclusion**.

The final paragraph says:

> "Rust was a good experiment, and there are aspects I will look back on fondly, but it is time to take the Linebender projects to a mature, production-ready language. I look forward to productive collaboration with others in the C++ community."

This is a **clear and definitive statement**, but it is followed by:

> "We’re looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite. If you’re interested, please join our Zulip instance."

And then:

> "Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust."

This is **not the tone of a holiday greeting**, but the **hint is in the structure of the article itself**. The article is written in a **very formal and structured way**, and the **title is missing**. This is a **common pattern in blog posts written on December 25th**, where the author is **not writing a holiday greeting**, but rather a **serious, technical post** on the same day that many people are writing **Christmas greetings**.

In other words, the **distinctive writing style** is the **contrast** between the **serious, technical tone** of the article and the **expectation of a more casual or festive tone** on **December 25th**. The author is **deliberately writing a serious article on a day when many people are writing holiday greetings**, and that is the **hint**.

So, the article was written on **December 25th**, and the **distinctive writing style** is the **clue** that it was written on a **day when such a tone would be unusual**. [end of text]
