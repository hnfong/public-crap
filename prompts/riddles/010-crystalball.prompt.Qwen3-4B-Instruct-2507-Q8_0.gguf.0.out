The clerk likely said this because, in many superstitions, a crystal ball is believed to be a medium for communicating with spirits or detecting supernatural forces. The warning to "cover it when you leave your house" suggests that leaving it uncovered might allow spirits or negative energies to enter the home or that the ball could attract unwanted attention. The clerk is cautioning the woman to protect her home and well-being by keeping the crystal ball secure and out of sight. [end of text]
