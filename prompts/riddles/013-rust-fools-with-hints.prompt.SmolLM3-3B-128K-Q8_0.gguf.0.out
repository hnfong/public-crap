Based on the distinctive writing style and the content of the passage, I would guess that this article was written in the early 2020s. Here's why:

1. **Language and Tone**: The author uses a formal, somewhat academic tone, which is typical of articles written in the early 2020s. The language is clear and concise, but also shows a level of technical expertise and familiarity with the Rust and C++ communities.

2. **References to New Features**: The author mentions C++20 and C++26, which were released in 2018 and 2020, respectively. This suggests that the article was written after these versions were released, but before the next major version of C++ (C++23, released in 2023).

3. **Rust Community Criticism**: The author criticizes the Rust community for being "imperious" and "demanding" that projects be rewritten in Rust. This type of criticism is more common in the early 2020s, when the Rust community was still growing and had not yet reached the level of maturity and acceptance that it has today.

4. **C++ Community Perception**: The author describes the C++ community as "nicer and friendlier" than the Rust community. This perception is more common in the early 2020s, when the C++ community was still seen as more established and welcoming compared to the Rust community.

5. **C++ Language Evolution**: The author mentions the rapid adoption of new features in C++, such as modules in C++20 and potentially a new syntax in C++26. This suggests that the article was written after the C++20 release, which occurred in 2018, but before the C++23 release, which occurred in 2023.

Considering these factors, I would estimate that the article was written in the early 2020s, likely between 2018 and 2020. The author's familiarity with the Rust and C++ communities, as well as their critique of the Rust community, suggests that the article was written during a time when the Rust community was still growing and had not yet reached the level of maturity and acceptance that it has today.
