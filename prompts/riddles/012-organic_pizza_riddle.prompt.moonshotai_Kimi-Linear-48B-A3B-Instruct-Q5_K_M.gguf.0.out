Let's break this down step by step.

**What did Bob eat?**
- **Aged organic milk**: This is milk that has been aged or fermented. This could be something like aged cheese, kefir, or even a type of aged milk product. The term "aged" is unusual for milk, but it likely refers to a fermented or cultured milk product.
- **Seasoned tomato purée spread**: This is essentially a seasoned tomato sauce or paste spread on something.
- **Baked whole wheat**: This refers to whole wheat bread or a whole wheat base that was baked.

So, putting it together, Bob ate a dish consisting of aged organic milk (likely a fermented or cultured dairy product) tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat. This sounds like a type of pizza or flatbread with a fermented dairy and tomato sauce topping.

**Was it healthy?**
- **Aged organic milk**: If it's a fermented product like kefir or aged cheese, it can be healthy due to probiotics and lower lactose content. However, if it's just "aged" in the sense of being old or spoiled, it could be unhealthy. The context suggests it's intentional (organic, aged), so it's likely a fermented product, which is generally healthy.
- **Seasoned tomato purée**: Tomatoes are rich in lycopene and vitamins, and seasoning can add flavor without many calories. This is generally healthy.
- **Baked whole wheat**: Whole wheat is a good source of fiber and nutrients. Baking it is a healthy preparation method.

Overall, the components seem healthy, but the combination might be unusual. The "wtf" reaction from Alice suggests she found the combination strange or unappetizing, not necessarily unhealthy. The healthiness depends on the specific type of aged milk and the amount of seasoning (e.g., high sodium or sugar could make it less healthy).

**Conclusion:**
Bob ate a dish made with aged organic milk (likely a fermented dairy product), seasoned tomato purée, and baked whole wheat. This is likely a healthy meal, though the combination might be unconventional. Alice's "wtf" reaction was likely due to the unusual combination, not the healthiness.

Bob ate a dish made with **aged organic milk** (likely a fermented or cultured dairy product like kefir or aged cheese), **seasoned tomato purée** spread on **baked whole wheat** (a whole wheat base, probably a flatbread or pizza crust).

Whether it was healthy depends on the specifics, but the components—fermented dairy, tomatoes, and whole grains—are generally nutritious. Alice’s “wtf” reaction was likely due to the unusual combination, not the healthfulness. [end of text]
