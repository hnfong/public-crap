Bob didn’t eat anything remotely resembling what he described.

He lied — dramatically and absurdly — to sound healthy.

What he *actually* ate?  
Probably something like:  
→ A slice of pizza  
→ A bag of chips  
→ A greasy burger  
→ Or just straight-up junk food  

He described a ridiculous, pseudo-healthy, overcomplicated, and physically impossible dish:  
> “Aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat.”

That’s not food. That’s nonsense.

- **Aged organic milk**? Milk doesn’t get “aged” like cheese — it spoils. If he meant cheese, he didn’t say that.  
- “Tossed over” implies liquid milk being thrown onto something — that’s not a real food prep method.  
- “Seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat” sounds like a half-baked (pun intended) description of pizza or bruschetta — but he didn’t say that. He said “baked whole wheat,” which could be bread, but then “tossed over” milk? That’s not a thing.

**So what did he actually eat?**  
Probably:  
→ A slice of pepperoni pizza  
→ Or a bowl of cereal with milk  
→ Or just junk food he’s trying to sound fancy about  

**Was it healthy?**  
Almost certainly not.  

**Alice’s “wtf”** is the perfect reaction.  
Bob didn’t eat a gourmet dish — he tried to gaslight her with nonsense.  
He ate junk. He lied. Alice called it out.  

**Final answer:**  
Bob ate something unhealthy (probably junk food), lied about it with a ridiculous, incoherent description, and Alice’s “wtf” is the only sane response.  
He didn’t eat healthy. He tried to fake it. And got caught. [end of text]
