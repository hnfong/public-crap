The reason is the Seduction skill of the Succubus, which makes it less commonly seen because it can distract or remove the player from the task at hand, especially in groups or during critical moments. Voidwalkers, while not as versatile, do not have this issue. 

However, the more direct answer is that the Seduction skill requires the Succubus to be within line of sight of the target, making it less useful in many situations compared to the Voidwalker's passive threat reduction and tanking abilities. 

But the most common and widely accepted answer is that the Seduction skill can accidentally pull additional mobs, making the Succubus less desirable for leveling and questing. 

In summary, the Seduction skill of the Succubus is the key factor, as it can lead to unwanted consequences, making the Voidwalker a safer choice for most players. 

The most concise answer is: Seduction can accidentally pull additional mobs. [end of text]
