Based on the content and the hint provided, my best guess is that this was written on **April 1, 2022**.

**Explanation of the Hint and Reasoning:**

The hint points to the "distinctive writing style" connected to a specific day and month. The article is a parody written in the style of an **April Fools' Day** joke.

Here is how the text utilizes this style:

1.  **Satirical Reversal of Reality:** The core of the joke is the complete inversion of the standard arguments in the programming community. The author claims to be leaving Rust (a language celebrated for safety, modern tooling, and an inclusive community) for C++ (often criticized for memory safety issues, fragmented build systems, and a less welcoming community) specifically *because* of those perceived flaws.
    *   *Example:* Praising the "near-monoculture" of Cargo as "limiting" while praising the fragmentation of C++ build systems (Autotools, SCons) as "choice."
    *   *Example:* Dismissing memory safety guarantees as "not that big a deal" and claiming that crashing GUIs are acceptable.
    *   *Example:* Claiming the C++ community is "nicer and friendlier" than the Rust community, which is a well-known tongue-in-cheek jab at internet discourse.

2.  **Specific Technical References (The Date Clues):**
    *   **C++20 Modules:** The author mentions looking forward to C++20 modules being "implemented fairly soon." While C++20 was released in 2020, module support in major compilers (like MSVC and GCC) was still maturing and becoming widely usable around early 2022.
    *   **C++26 and Carbon:** The text mentions "C++26" and the "Carbon language." Carbon was publicly announced by Google in July 2022. For an April Fools' post in **2022**, mentioning Carbon as an exciting new "C++ compatible" prospect fits perfectly as a cutting-edge (or slightly prophetic) reference for that time frame.
    *   **Linebender:** The "Linebender" organization is a real group that creates Rust GUI tools (like `kurbo` and `peniko`). Using a real entity adds verisimilitude to the prank.

3.  **The "Community" Section:** The section attacking the Rust community's Code of Conduct and diversity initiatives as "politics" is written to be deliberately provocative and absurd, mimicking the "grumpy old programmer" stereotype often exaggerated in April Fools' humor.

Therefore, the "distinctive writing style" is the hallmark of an April Fools' Day announcement—deadpan delivery of absurd opinions—and the technical context points to **April 1, 2022**. [end of text]
