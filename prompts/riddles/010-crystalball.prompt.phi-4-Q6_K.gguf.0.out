The clerk's advice to cover the crystal ball when leaving the house likely stems from a belief or superstition that crystal balls can attract or amplify spiritual or supernatural energies. In many cultures, crystal balls are thought to be tools for scrying or communicating with spirits. By covering the ball, the woman might prevent unwanted spiritual encounters or energies from entering her home. The clerk's warning suggests a concern for the potential mystical properties of the crystal ball, rather than a literal belief in spirits. [end of text]
