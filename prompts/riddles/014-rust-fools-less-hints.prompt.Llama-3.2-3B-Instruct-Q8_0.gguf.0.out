A fun task!

After analyzing the passage, I'm going to take a stab at guessing the date. Here's my reasoning:

1. The author mentions C++20, which was released in 2021. This suggests that the passage was written after 2021.
2. The author also mentions C++26, which is a future version of the language. This implies that the passage was written before the official announcement of C++26, which is expected to be released in 2023.
3. The author mentions the Rust community's reputation for being "imperious" and "denigrating" other programming languages, which was a common criticism of the Rust community in the mid to late 2010s.
4. The author also mentions the Rust community's code of conduct and policies promoting diversity, which was a topic of discussion in the Rust community around 2018-2020.
5. The author's tone and language suggest that they are leaving the Rust community and joining the C++ community, which was a common phenomenon in the mid to late 2010s, particularly among developers who were dissatisfied with Rust's limitations and complexity.

Taking these points into account, I'm going to guess that the passage was written around 2018-2019. This was a time when the Rust community was still growing and evolving, but also when some developers were starting to express dissatisfaction with the language's limitations and complexity.

Am I close? [end of text]
