Let’s analyze the passage carefully, looking for temporal clues, language evolution references, ecosystem context, and cultural markers.

### Key Temporal and Technical Clues

1. **Rust’s "generic associated types" (GATs) recently landed**  
   - GATs were stabilized in **Rust 1.65.0**, released in **December 2022**.
   - The text says: *"recently landed features such as generic associated types"*, so this was written **after late 2022**.

2. **"type alias impl trait" is forthcoming**  
   - This feature (TAIT) was still unstable as of early 2023, and the first stable version began appearing in **Rust 1.66+** (late 2022/early 2023). The author treats it as "forthcoming", suggesting the text predates its stabilization.

3. **C++20 modules are "fairly soon" to be implemented**  
   - C++20 modules were standardized in 2020, but compiler support (especially MSVC, Clang, GCC) was still maturing in **2021–2023**.
   - The author says they’re looking forward to modules being implemented "fairly soon", implying this was written **before widespread module adoption**, likely **2021–2023**.

4. **C++26 features mentioned**:  
   - Stackful coroutines, embedding binary data, safe range-for — these were proposals for C++26 (targeting ~2026). The author is speculating about the future, so this doesn’t anchor the date tightly, but suggests forward-looking perspective common in 2022–2023.

5. **"cppfront" and "Carbon"**  
   - Herb Sutter announced **cppfront** in **September 2022**.
   - **Carbon** was announced by Google in **July 2022**.
   - Mentioning both as "exciting changes to look forward to" suggests the text was written **within months to a year after these announcements**, i.e., **late 2022 or 2023**.

6. **"async has been a major effort" in Rust**  
   - Rust’s async/await stabilized in **2019–2020**. The reflection that it "used to be quite rapid" but now is "sedate" fits a **2022–2023** perspective.

7. **Linebender projects**  
   - Linebender is a real project (2D graphics in Rust). Its main components (like `piet`, `kurbo`) were actively developed in 2021–2023.
   - A well-known contributor (Raph Levien) made a public pivot away from Rust around **early 2023**, which matches the tone and content of this essay.

8. **"Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust"**  
   - This style of call-to-discussion was common in **2020–2023** blog posts.

9. **Tone about Rust community "imperiousness" and CoC**  
   - The critique of Rust’s community dynamics, CoC, and diversity politics peaked in discourse around **2021–2023**, especially after high-profile debates (e.g., resignation of mod team members, "Rust is not an ethical language" essays).

10. **"I’ve been responsible for some CVEs (including font parsing code in Android)"**  
    - The Android font parsing CVE (e.g., CVE-2016-3873) was from **2016**, but the author says "I’ve been responsible for some", implying past experience. This doesn’t date the essay, but fits a veteran’s retrospective.

### Putting It Together

- The mention of **GATs as recently landed**, **TAIT as forthcoming**, **C++20 modules not yet widely adopted**, **cppfront/Carbon as new**, and **Rust’s async as a major recent effort** all point to **early-to-mid 2023**.
- The cultural commentary aligns with community discussions prominent in **2022–2023**.
- The Linebender context and Raph Levien’s known pivot from Rust in **January 2023** (he wrote a similar essay then) strongly suggest this is that same essay or a contemporaneous one.

### Best Guess

**April 2023**

Why not earlier?
- Too early: GATs weren’t stable in 2021.
- Too late: By mid-2023, C++ module support was advancing, and the "excitement" around Carbon/cppfront was fresher.

April 2023 fits:
- GATs stabilized Dec 2022 → "recently" in April 2023 is plausible.
- C++ modules still not "fairly soon" in many toolchains.
- Cultural fatigue with Rust’s community dynamics peaked post-2022.
- The essay reads like a reaction to the state of Rust in early 2023.
