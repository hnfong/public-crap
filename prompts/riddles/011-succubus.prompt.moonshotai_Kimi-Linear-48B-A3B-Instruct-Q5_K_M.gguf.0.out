The answer is: **Succubi are often invisible to players who don't have the quest or are not in a party with the warlock.**

This is a classic "invisible" joke in the WoW community. The succubus is indeed better for leveling and questing due to its seduction ability, but many players never see them because they are only visible to the warlock and their party members. To others, the warlock just appears to be summoning a voidwalker or imp.

So the riddle is playing on the fact that **"most warlocks" are seen with voidwalkers because the succubus is "invisible" to most people.** [end of text]
