The user is asking me to explain why the clerk said "Be sure to cover it when you leave your house" in response to the woman's question "Why? Spirits?"

This is a short story prompt that seems to be setting up a mystery or supernatural element. The clerk's warning suggests the crystal ball needs to be covered when the house is empty. The woman's immediate assumption is "Spirits?" which is a reasonable guess given it's a crystal ball from an antique shop.

I need to think about possible reasons for this instruction:

1. **Supernatural/Spiritual**: To prevent spirits from being attracted to it or escaping from it when no one is home to supervise it. This aligns with the woman's guess.

2. **Practical**: 
   - To prevent sun damage (focusing sunlight like a magnifying glass and starting a fire)
   - To prevent theft (covering it hides it from view)
   - To prevent dust accumulation
   - To protect it from damage

3. **Metaphorical**: The clerk might be speaking metaphorically about privacy or energy.

Given the context (antique shop, crystal ball, the woman's immediate jump to "Spirits?"), the most likely intended answer is supernatural. However, I should consider if there's a clever twist.

The most interesting and concise explanation would be the practical one about sunlight, as it subverts the supernatural expectation while being logical. Crystal balls can indeed act as magnifying glasses and focus sunlight, creating a fire hazard. This is a known safety issue with glass spheres.

Let me think about the structure of the story:
- Antique shop - suggests old, possibly mystical items
- Crystal ball - traditionally associated with divination, spirits
- Clerk's warning - specific condition: "when you leave your house"
- Woman's assumption - "Spirits?" - shows she expects a supernatural explanation

The twist would be that the reason is mundane (fire hazard) rather than supernatural. This creates irony and makes the story more interesting.

The question asks me to "Explain concisely." So I should give a brief, clear answer.

I should probably address both possibilities but lead with the most likely intended answer for a short story format, which would be the ironic/mundane explanation that subverts expectations.

Let me craft a concise explanation:
- The clerk's warning is likely about a practical danger: crystal balls can focus sunlight like a magnifying lens, creating a fire hazard when unattended.
- This creates irony because the woman assumes a supernatural reason ("Spirits?") when the real reason is mundane physics.
- The phrase "when you leave your house" is key - it's about being unattended, which is when fire hazards are most dangerous.

I should keep it brief and to the point.The clerk's warning is practical, not supernatural: a crystal ball can focus sunlight like a magnifying glass, creating a fire hazard in an empty house. The woman's assumption of "Spirits?" highlights the irony—she expects mystical dangers when the real risk is mundane physics. [end of text]
