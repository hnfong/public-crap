This scenario is playing on the ambiguity of language and our expectations. 

Here's what likely happened:

* **Bob's description is intentionally misleading.** He uses fancy culinary terms ("aged organic milk," "seasoned tomato purée," "baked whole wheat") to make his meal sound gourmet and healthy.
* **The photo reveals the truth.**  The "wtf" reaction from Alice suggests the photo shows something unexpected and likely not appetizing.

**What did Bob eat?**

It's impossible to know for sure without seeing the photo, but it's probably something simple and potentially unappealing when described in such a pretentious way. Some possibilities:

* **Tomato soup and milk:** The "tomato purée" is likely just tomato soup, and the "aged organic milk" is regular milk poured over it.
* **Toast with tomato sauce:** The "baked whole wheat" could be toast, and the rest is just tomato sauce.

**Was it healthy?**

It's hard to say definitively without knowing the exact ingredients and preparation. However, the combination of tomato-based sauce and milk/dairy could be a decent source of nutrients. 

**The point of the scenario:**

The humor lies in the contrast between Bob's pretentious description and the likely reality of his meal. It satirizes people who use overly complicated language to make mundane things seem more impressive.
