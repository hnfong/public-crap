Okay, so I need to figure out when this passage was written. Let me read through it carefully and pick up on any clues that might indicate the date.

First, the author is talking about moving from Rust to C++ for their Linebender projects. They mention several points about build systems, safety, language evolution, and community. 

Looking at the build systems section, they talk about Cargo being the near-monoculture for Rust, but in C++ there are options like CMake, Meson, Bazel, etc. They mention considering CMake and maybe Meson. I know that Meson has been around for a while, but I'm not sure when it became popular. CMake has been a standard for longer.

In the safety section, the author downplays the risks of moving to C++, mentioning that they're a good programmer and that memory safety issues aren't as big a deal for their use case. They also talk about modern C++ techniques and the C++ Core Guidelines. The Core Guidelines were first introduced around 2015, so that's a point of reference.

The language evolution part is more telling. They mention C++20 bringing modules and looking forward to C++26 features like stackful coroutines and a safe range-based for loop. C++20 was published in December 2020, so if the author is looking ahead to C++26, which would be around 2026, that suggests the passage was written after C++20's release but before C++23, which is set for 2023. They also mention Herb Sutter's cppfront proposal and the Carbon language. Carbon was announced in 2022 by Google, so that's a key point. So the passage must be after 2022.

The community section talks about the Rust community being imperious and the C++ subreddit's sense of humor. They also mention Rust's code of conduct and diversity policies, which have been a topic for a few years now, but nothing specific to a date.

Putting it all together: the mention of C++20 features, looking forward to C++26, and Carbon being mentioned (which was announced in 2022) suggests the passage was written in late 2022 or early 2023. Since C++23 is coming up, but the author is looking to C++26, it's likely after C++20's release but before C++23's. So maybe around mid to late 2022 or early 2023.

Wait, but Carbon was announced in July 2022. So if the author is talking about it, the passage must be after that. So probably late 2022 or early 2023. Also, the mention of C++26 features like stackful coroutines, which were discussed but not yet standardized as of 2023. So the author is speculating about future features, which would make sense in 2023.

So I think the passage was written in 2023, after July when Carbon was announced, but before C++23's release in December 2023. Maybe around mid-2023.

The passage was likely written in mid-2023. Key indicators include the mention of C++20 features, anticipation of C++26, and the reference to Google's Carbon language, which was announced in July 2022. These elements suggest the author wrote the text after Carbon's announcement but before the release of C++23 in December 2023. Therefore, the best estimate is mid-2023. 

**Answer:** The passage was written around mid-2023. [end of text]
