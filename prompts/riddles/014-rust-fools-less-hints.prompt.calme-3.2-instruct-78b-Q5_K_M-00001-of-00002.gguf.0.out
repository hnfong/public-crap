This passage was likely written in 2023. The author references C++20 and anticipates C++26, which would be in line with the 3-year standard release cycle for C++. The mention of "C++ compatible Carbon language" also gives a clue, as Carbon was announced in 2022 as a potential successor to C++, so this text would have been written after that announcement. The critique of Rust's "edition mechanism" and the mention of "generic associated types" and "type alias impl trait" as recent or forthcoming features also suggest a recent date, as these are features that have been discussed and implemented in Rust in the 2020s. The author's perspective on community and code of conduct policies could also suggest a date when these discussions were particularly prominent in the Rust community, which has been an ongoing topic since the mid-2010s but may have had heightened visibility in recent years.
