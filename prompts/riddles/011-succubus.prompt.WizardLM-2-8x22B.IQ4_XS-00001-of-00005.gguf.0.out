Most warlocks in classic World of Warcraft are seen with voidwalkers, especially at lower levels, because the voidwalker provides superior survivability and damage mitigation through its tanking abilities, such as Suffering and Sacrifice. This is particularly important for solo play and leveling, where the warlock's own defenses are limited.

The succubus, while offering higher damage output and utility through abilities like Seduction and Soothing Kiss, is less durable and more suited to PvP or group play where crowd control and damage are more valuable than tanking. The succubus's Seduction ability, which charms an enemy for a short duration, can also be unreliable in certain situations, as it can break on damage and has a relatively long cooldown.

Additionally, the voidwalker's ability to hold aggro and absorb damage allows the warlock to cast spells without being interrupted by melee attacks, which is crucial for maintaining consistent damage output and self-healing through Life Tap. This makes the voidwalker the preferred choice for many warlocks during the leveling process, despite the succubus's allure in other aspects of the game. [end of text]
