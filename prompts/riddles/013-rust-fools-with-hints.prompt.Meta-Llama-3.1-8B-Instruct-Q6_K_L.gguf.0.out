After carefully reading the passage, I'm going to take a guess that it was written on April 1st, 2023.

My reasoning is based on the writing style and the content of the passage. The author mentions that they're looking forward to C++26, which suggests that the passage is written before the release of C++26. C++26 is expected to be released in 2024, so it's likely that the passage was written in 2023.

However, the more significant hint is the author's tone and language, which is playful and tongue-in-cheek. The author mentions that they're "glad to be rid of" the Rust community's "imperious" behavior and that they're looking forward to the "nicer and friendlier" C++ community. This tone is reminiscent of April Fools' Day, where people often write humorous and satirical articles.

Furthermore, the author mentions that they're looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite, and invites readers to join their Zulip instance. This is a common way to recruit contributors, but the tone of the invitation seems lighthearted and playful, which is consistent with the tone of an April Fools' Day article.

Taking all these factors into account, I believe that the passage was written on April 1st, 2023, as a humorous and satirical article. [end of text]
