**Best guess: Early 2020s (circa 2020‑2022).**

**Reasoning**

1. **C++20 and C++26 references**  
   - The author mentions “C++20 brings us modules” and looks forward to “C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines…”.  
   - C++20 was officially released in 2020, and the first major implementations (e.g., Clang, GCC) landed around 2020‑2021.  
   - C++26 is a future standard (the next after C++23), and the discussion of “stackful coroutines” and “safe range‑based for loop” reflects proposals that were being discussed in the C++ community in the early 2020s (e.g., P2327 “stackful coroutines”, P1xx “safe range‑based for loop”).  
   - The timeline of “C++20 → C++26” suggests the author is writing after C++20 is out but before C++26 is finalized (which is still in the future as of 2025). This aligns with a window of roughly 2020‑2022.

2. **Rust edition mechanism and language evolution**  
   - The author says “Rust is held back by its commitment to not break existing code (enacted by the edition mechanism)”.  
   - The “edition” mechanism was introduced in Rust 2018 (the 2018 edition) and is a key part of Rust’s evolution story. By the early 2020s, the community was discussing the upcoming 2021 edition (released in 2021) and the future 2024 edition.  
   - The comment about “generic associated types” and “type alias impl trait” being “more of the flavor of making combinations of existing features work as expected” reflects the state of Rust in the 2020‑2021 period, when those features were being stabilized or were recent additions.

3. **Build system context**  
   - The author mentions “the near‑monoculture of the Cargo build system” and contrasts it with C++ build systems like CMake, Meson, Blaze, Autotools, SCons, etc.  
   - This reflects a period when Cargo was dominant in the Rust ecosystem (which has been the case since ~2018) but also when the C++ build‑system landscape was still fragmented, with many projects still using CMake, Meson, etc.  
   - The mention of “AIX” and “DEC OSF/1 AXP” as Unix systems to support suggests the author is dealing with legacy platforms, which is more common in enterprise or graphics‑toolkit contexts in the early 2020s.

4. **Community and social media references**  
   - The author says “I hear that the Rust community can be extremely imperious, constantly demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust, and denigrating all other programming languages.”  
   - This reflects the “Rust evangelism” phenomenon that was prominent in the early 2020s (e.g., 2019‑2021), when there was a lot of discussion about Rust’s “ evangelism” and the community’s perceived “imperial” stance.  
   - The comment about “the C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor” also aligns with the C++ subreddit’s culture in the early 2020s.

5. **Safety and C++ evolution**  
   - The author says “the C++ language is evolving to become safer” and references “Stroustrup’s paper on safety”.  
   - This likely refers to the C++ safety initiatives and papers (e.g., the “C++ Safety” paper by Stroustrup, which was discussed in the early 2020s).  
   - The mention of “modern C++ techniques to avoid many of the dangers of raw pointers” and “the C++ core guidelines” reflects the state of C++ best practices in the early 2020s.

6. **Linebender projects and Zulip**  
   - The author mentions “Linebender projects” and “Zulip instance”.  
   - “Linebender” is a graphics‑related project (2D graphics, GUI toolkits). The mention of “Zulip” (a real‑time collaboration platform) suggests the project is using modern collaboration tools, which is common in the early 2020s.

7. **Absence of later developments**  
   - The author does not mention later Rust developments (e.g., the 2024 edition, async/await improvements, const generics, etc.) that would be relevant if the text were written after ~2023.  
   - The author does not mention later C++ developments (e.g., C++23’s “deducing this”, C++26’s “stackful coroutines” being more finalized, etc.) that would be relevant if the text were written after ~2023.

**Conclusion**  
The passage reflects a period when C++20 was newly released, Rust’s edition mechanism was a known concept, and the C++ and Rust communities were in the state they were in the early 2020s. The best guess is **circa 2020‑2022**, with a slight lean toward **2021** (when C++20 was widely implemented and Rust’s 2021 edition was being discussed).
