Based on the content and context of the passage, my best guess is that it was written **in late 2023 or early 2024**. Here's why:

---

### 1. **C++26 Features Mentioned**
The passage references **C++26** and mentions upcoming features like:
- Stackful coroutines
- Safe range-based for loops
- Embedding binary file contents

These are speculative but align with **current C++ standardization roadmaps**. The C++ standards committee typically plans features a few years in advance, and many of these are being discussed for **C++26**, which is expected around **2026**, but the writing would likely occur **1–2 years before the standard is finalized**, suggesting the text was written **around 2023–2024**.

---

### 2. **Mention of Herb Sutter’s `cppfront` Proposal**
The author refers to Herb Sutter’s **`cppfront`**—a proposed experimental C++ syntax that aims to modernize the language and improve ergonomics. This project was **announced publicly in late 2022** and discussed more widely in **2023**.

This implies the passage was written **after late 2022**, when `cppfront` became known to the broader C++ community.

---

### 3. **Carbon Language**
The author also mentions **Carbon**, a new experimental language aiming to be a successor to C++. Carbon was **announced by Google in July 2022**, and early discussions continued into **2023**.

Its inclusion in the passage suggests the text was written **after mid-2022**, and more likely in **2023 or 2024**, when Carbon was still a hot topic among C++ developers.

---

### 4. **Rust’s Edition Mechanism and Stability**
The author comments on **Rust’s edition system** and how it slows down innovation. Rust editions (like 2015, 2018, 2021, 2024) are released roughly every 3 years. The **Rust 2021 edition** was stabilized in late 2021, and the **Rust 2024 edition** was in active development and discussion in **2023–2024**.

The tone suggests that Rust’s innovation has slowed **after async and GATs**, which were stabilized around **2020–2022**, so the passage likely reflects a **2023 or early 2024 perspective**.

---

### 5. **Linebender Project Context**
The **Linebender project** (which includes Druid, a Rust-based GUI toolkit) has been active since around **2020**, and discussions about build systems and language choices have been ongoing. However, the idea of **migrating away from Rust to C++** seems **recent**, possibly speculative or satirical, and likely written **after 2022**, when the project had matured enough to evaluate its tooling and language choices.

---

### 6. **Satirical or Provocative Tone**
The passage has a **provocative tone**, especially in the "Community" section, where it contrasts the Rust and C++ communities in a way that seems **intentionally exaggerated or satirical**. This kind of piece often appears in response to **trending debates** on platforms like Hacker News or Reddit.

The final line says:  
> "Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust."

This suggests it was written **to spark discussion**, likely in **2023 or early 2024**, when debates about Rust’s safety, build system monoculture, and community culture were particularly active.

---

### 7. **C++ Community Sentiment**
The author mentions the **C++ subreddit’s sense of humor**, which became a more widely recognized cultural reference in **2022–2023**, especially after several viral posts contrasting C++ memes with Rust’s more serious tone.

---

### Final Estimate: **Late 2023 to Early 2024**

This aligns with:
- The state of C++ standardization (C++26 planning)
- The existence and discussion of `cppfront` and Carbon
- Rust’s edition and feature development timeline
- The cultural context of online programming debates

If I had to pick a specific date range:  
> **Approximately between September 2023 and March 2024**

Let me know if you'd like me to analyze whether this passage is **satirical or serious**, or to explore its **technical or cultural implications** further. [end of text]
