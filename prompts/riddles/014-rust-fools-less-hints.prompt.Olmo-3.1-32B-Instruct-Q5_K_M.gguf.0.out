Let's break down the clues and context in the passage to estimate when it might have been written.

### Key Clues and Analysis

#### 1. **Mentions of Rust and C++ Language Features**
- The passage discusses Rust's slower pace of innovation, specifically mentioning "recently landed features such as generic associated types" and "type alias impl trait."
    - **Generic Associated Types (GATs):** Stabilized in Rust 1.71 (released December 2020).
    - **Type Alias Impl Trait:** Stabilized in Rust 1.67 (released August 2022).
    - The passage implies these features are "recent," suggesting the text was written after these releases, but before even newer features became mainstream.
- The passage also mentions "stackful coroutines" as a forthcoming C++ feature. Stackful coroutines were proposed for C++23 but not finalized until C++26 (expected late 2024).
    - However, the mention of "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines" suggests the author is speculating based on the trajectory of C++ standardization, which was plausible in 2022-2023.

#### 2. **References to Community and Social Media**
- The passage refers to the Rust community's "imperious" behavior and mentions social media, Reddit, and HN discussions.
    - These platforms and their cultures have been relatively stable for several years, but the tone and specific references (e.g., "the Rust community can be extremely imperious") may reflect a time when Rust's evangelism was at a peak, roughly 2018-2022.

#### 3. **Build Systems**
- The passage discusses CMake, Meson, Bazel, and others as build systems for C++, and notes that Rust's ecosystem is dominated by Cargo.
    - These points have been true for several years, but the specific mention of Bazel integration for polyglot projects and the uncertainty about which build system to use for "Linebender projects" suggests a time when Rust's ecosystem was still maturing in these areas, i.e., pre-2022.

#### 4. **References to "Linebender" and "GUI toolkits"**
- The author mentions work on GUI toolkits in Rust and moving to C++ for the "Linebender projects."
    - There is no widely known project called "Linebender" in the Rust or C++ ecosystem as of my knowledge cutoff (June 2024), so this is likely a proprietary or niche project.

#### 5. **Mentions of C++ Evolution and Herb Sutter**
- The passage references Bjarne Stroustrup's paper on safety and Herb Sutter's cppfront proposal.
    - Herb Sutter's cppfront (a C++ language experiment) was active around 2019-2021, but the idea of a new syntax for C++ has been discussed for years.
    - Stroustrup's safety paper was published in 2022 ("A safe and scalable theorem prover for C++").

#### 6. **Tone and Attitude**
- The passage expresses frustration with Rust's ecosystem and community, and nostalgia for C++'s maturity.
    - This tone fits with a time when Rust was still young and evolving rapidly, but some developers were feeling fatigue or frustration as the ecosystem matured and stabilized (around 2021-2023).

#### 7. **References to "Carbon language"**
- The passage mentions "the new C++ compatible Carbon language."
    - Carbon was announced by Google in July 2022. So, any reference to Carbon as a "new" language would have to be after that date.

### Putting It All Together

- **Rust features referenced (GATs, type alias impl trait):** Stabilized in late 2020 and mid-2022.
- **C++26 features (stackful coroutines):** Speculative as of 2022-2023, since C++26 wasn't finalized yet.
- **Carbon language:** Announced July 2022.
- **Stroustrup's safety paper:** 2022.
- **Community tone:** Fits 2021-2023, when Rust's rapid early growth had slowed and some fatigue set in.

Given all these, the most plausible window is **late 2022 to early 2023**.

However, let's look for more precise markers:

- The author says "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines," which was not yet a done deal but was being actively discussed in 2022-2023.
- The mention of Carbon as a "new" language fits only after July 2022.
- The reference to Rust's "recently landed features" (GATs and type alias impl trait) suggests after August 2022.
- The overall tone and the sense that Rust's innovation pace has slowed fits the post-1.0, post-async Rust period (2021+).

### **Best Guess:**
**Written in late 2022 or early 2023.**

Most likely, the passage was written sometime between October 2022 and April 2023.

If I had to pick a specific date, I'd estimate **late 2022 (perhaps November or December 2022)**, given the stabilization of Rust 1.67 (type alias impl trait) in August 2022 and the ongoing discussion about C++26 features and Carbon at that time.

**Final Answer:**
> **Best guess: Written in late 2022, possibly November or December 2022.** [end of text]
