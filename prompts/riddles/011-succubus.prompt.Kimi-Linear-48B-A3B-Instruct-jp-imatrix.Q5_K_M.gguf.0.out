The answer is: **Succubi are often feared by players due to their seduction ability, making them less commonly used despite their practical advantages.**

In *World of Warcraft: Classic*, the succubus has a seduction ability that can charm enemies, potentially causing them to attack the succubus instead of the warlock. This can be dangerous in certain situations, especially when soloing or in crowded areas. As a result, many players avoid using succubi for fear of losing control of their pet or dying unexpectedly. The voidwalker, with its tanking abilities and more predictable behavior, is seen as safer and more reliable, even if it's not always the most efficient choice.

So, the riddle plays on the idea that the succubus *is* the better choice in theory, but its practical use is limited by a fear-based perception among players. [end of text]
