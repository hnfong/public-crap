<think>First, the riddle is about why most warlocks in classic WoW are seen with voidwalkers even though the succubus is better for leveling and questing. The hint mentions a skill of the succubus that makes them more common than perceived.

I need to recall what classic WoW refers to. Classic WoW is the original version of World of Warcraft before expansions. Warlocks are a class that can summon demons like voidwalkers and succubus.

The succubus is typically better for leveling because it has skills that help with damage or crowd control. But the riddle says most warlocks are seen with voidwalkers. So, there must be a reason why voidwalkers are more common despite the succubus being better.

The hint says "a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived." That seems contradictory. If the succubus has a skill that makes it more common, why are voidwalkers seen more often? Maybe I misread.

Let me think about the skills. In classic WoW, warlocks can summon different demons. The voidwalker is a tank demon that has high health and can hold aggro, which is useful for solo leveling. The succubus is a damage demon that has higher damage output but less tanking ability.

But the riddle says the succubus is usually better for leveling and questing. So, why are voidwalkers seen more often?

Perhaps there's a skill that makes the succubus less visible or something. The hint says "a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived." "More common than perceived" might mean that succubus are actually common, but they are not seen as common because of a skill.

What skill does the succubus have? In classic WoW, the succubus has a skill called "Seduce" which is a crowd control spell that charms an enemy, making it incapacitated for a while. But that doesn't make it more common; it just helps with control.

Maybe "more common than perceived" means that warlocks often use succubus, but because of a skill, they are not seen with them. But that doesn't make sense because when you summon a demon, it follows you around.

Perhaps the skill is "Invisibility" or something? But succubus doesn't have invisibility.

Let me think about the riddle again. "Why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though the succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing?" And the answer is because of a skill of the succubus that makes them more common than perceived.

Maybe "more common than perceived" means that the succubus is actually used more often, but because of a skill, it appears less often? That seems odd.

Another idea: in classic WoW, warlocks can use the succubus to seduce enemies, but if the succubus is seducing, it might not be following the warlock, so it's not seen. But that doesn't explain why voidwalkers are seen more often.

Perhaps the skill is "Subjugate" or something, but I don't recall.

Let me recall the demons: voidwalker, succubus, imp, felhunter, and doomguard. For leveling, voidwalker is good because it tanks, and succubus is good because it does more damage.

But the riddle says succubus is better for leveling and questing, so why are voidwalkers seen more? Maybe because of a specific skill that makes the succubus less desirable in certain situations.

The hint says "a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived." So, the skill makes the succubus common, but perceived as less common? That doesn't add up.

Perhaps "more common than perceived" means that people think succubus are less common, but they are actually common because of this skill.

But why are voidwalkers seen more? Maybe because warlocks often use voidwalkers for tanking, but if succubus is better, there must be a reason why voidwalkers are preferred.

I think I remember something: in classic WoW, the succubus has a skill called "Seduce" which is a channeled spell that incapacitates an enemy. But if the warlock is using seduce, the succubus is busy controlling an enemy, so it might not be following the warlock, but it's still summoned.

But that doesn't explain why voidwalkers are seen more often.

Another thought: perhaps the skill is "Invisibility" but succubus doesn't have invisibility. Warlocks can use "Shadowmeld" but that's for night elves, not warlocks.

Let's think about the riddle structure. It might be a pun or a play on words.

The riddle says "why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers" and the answer is because of a skill of the succubus that makes them more common than perceived.

"More common than perceived" might mean that the succubus is actually used more often, but because of a skill, it is not seen, so voidwalkers are seen instead.

But what skill makes the succubus not seen? In classic WoW, when you summon a demon, it is visible unless you use a spell to make it invisible, but warlocks don't have that.

Perhaps the skill is "Subjugate" but that's for controlling demons, not making them invisible.

I think I have it: in classic WoW, the succubus has a skill called "Seduce" which requires the succubus to be channeled on the target. During seduce, the succubus is not following the warlock; it is standing still controlling the enemy. So, if the warlock is using seduce, the succubus is not seen following them, but it is still summoned.

But that doesn't make voidwalkers seen more often; it just means that when warlocks are using succubus, they might not be seen with it because it's busy seducing.

But the riddle says "most warlocks are seen with voidwalkers", so if warlocks are using succubus for seduce, they are not seen with it, so voidwalkers are seen more because warlocks often use voidwalkers for tanking, and when they use succubus, it's not visible.

But that seems weak.

Another idea: perhaps the skill is "Invisibility" but warlocks don't have that. Let's recall the succubus skills: in classic WoW, the succubus has "Seduce", "Lash", "Subjugate" but subjugate is for controlling other demons, not for making itself invisible.

I remember something: in classic WoW, warlocks can use the spell "Shadowmeld" but that's only for night elves, and it makes the character invisible, but not the demon.

Perhaps the riddle is about the succubus's ability to be used for crowd control, so warlocks often use it, but when they are not in combat, they might have it summoned, but if they are using seduce, it's not following them, so it's not seen.

But that doesn't explain why voidwalkers are seen more.

Let's think about the riddle from a different perspective. "Why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers?" because of a skill of the succubus that makes them more common than perceived.

"More common than perceived" means that people think succubus are less common, but they are actually common because of this skill.

But why are voidwalkers seen more? Because when warlocks use succubus, they are not seen with it due to the skill, so voidwalkers are seen instead.

So, what skill makes the succubus not seen? In classic WoW, when you summon a demon, it is visible, but if you use the demon for seduce, it is still visible when it is seducing, but if you dismiss it, it disappears.

Perhaps warlocks often dismiss the succubus when they are not using it, but that doesn't make sense.

I think I have a better memory: in classic WoW, the succubus has a skill called "Lash" but that's damage.

Another thought: perhaps the skill is "Subjugate" but that's for controlling other demons, not for making the succubus invisible.

Let's recall the riddle: "a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived." The word "them" refers to warlocks or to succubus? The riddle says "most warlocks are seen with voidwalkers" so "them" might refer to warlocks, but the skill is of the succubus, so it makes warlocks more common than perceived? That doesn't make sense.

Perhaps "them" refers to the succubus. So, a skill of the succubus makes the succubus more common than perceived.

But why are warlocks seen with voidwalkers then?

Perhaps because warlocks use the succubus for seduce, and when they are seducing, they are not seen with the succubus because it's busy, so voidwalkers are seen more often.

But that doesn't explain why voidwalkers are seen most of the time.

I remember something: in classic WoW, for warlocks, the voidwalker is often used because it has high health and can tank, so for solo leveling, it's preferred. But the riddle says succubus is usually better for leveling and questing, so why are voidwalkers seen more? Maybe because of a specific reason.

Perhaps the succubus is better for damage, but for questing, sometimes you need tanking, so voidwalker is used.

But the riddle says "most warlocks are seen with voidwalkers" so there must be a reason why voidwalkers are more common.

Let's think about the skill of the succubus. What skill does the succubus have that makes it more common? The hint says "makes them more common than perceived" so people perceive that succubus are less common, but they are actually common because of this skill.

But what skill? Perhaps "Seduce" is used often, so warlocks use succubus often, but when they are using seduce, the succubus is not following them, so it's not seen, so voidwalkers are seen more.

But that doesn't make warlocks most seen with voidwalkers; it just means that when warlocks are using succubus, they are not seen with it, so voidwalkers are seen when they are not using succubus.

But why would warlocks not use succubus often? Because for some quests, seduce is not useful, or for tanking, voidwalker is better.

But the riddle says succubus is better for leveling and questing, so why are warlocks not using it?

Perhaps because of the skill "Seduce" which requires the succubus to be channeled, so if the warlock is moving, the succubus might not be following, so it's not seen.

But that doesn't explain why voidwalkers are seen most.

I think I found the answer online or in my memory. In classic WoW, the succubus has a skill called "Invisibility" but warlocks don't have invisibility. Let's check the skills.

Upon recalling, in classic WoW, the succubus does not have invisibility. Warlocks can use "Vanish" but that's for rogues.

Another idea: perhaps the skill is "Subjugate" which allows warlocks to control other demons, but that doesn't make the succubus common.

Let's consider the word "perceived" in the riddle. "More common than perceived" might mean that people think warlocks use voidwalkers more, but they actually use succubus more, but because of a skill, they are not seen with it.

So, what skill makes the warlock not seen with the succubus? When the warlock uses "Seduce", the succubus is busy controlling an enemy, so it is not following the warlock, so when you see a warlock, if they are using seduce, you don't see the succubus with them, so you think they have a voidwalker, but they actually have a succubus.

But that doesn't make most warlocks seen with voidwalkers; it just means that when they are using seduce, they are not seen with succubus.

But for most warlocks, they are seen with voidwalkers because they use voidwalkers for tanking, and when they use succubus, it's not visible.

But the riddle says "most warlocks are seen with voidwalkers" so if most warlocks use succubus for leveling, why are they seen with voidwalkers? Because when they are using succubus, it's not seen, so voidwalkers are seen when they are not using succubus.

But why would they not use succubus? Because for some quests, seduce is not useful, or for tanking, voidwalker is better.

But the riddle says succubus is usually better for leveling and questing, so why are warlocks not using it?

Perhaps because of the skill "Seduce" which requires the warlock to be stationary or something, but that doesn't make sense.

I think I remember now: in classic WoW, the succubus has a skill called "Lash" but that's damage.

Let's think about the riddle from a wordplay perspective. "Seen with voidwalkers" might be a pun on "voidwalkers" and "perceived" might be a pun on "perceive" but I don't see it.

Another thought: perhaps "more common than perceived" means that the succubus is common because warlocks use it for its skill, but when they are not using it, they have it summoned, but it is not seen because it is invisible? But how is it invisible?

In classic WoW, warlocks can use the spell "Shadowmeld" but only night elves have it, and it makes the character invisible, but not the demon.

Perhaps the skill is "Invisibility" but warlocks don't have that spell.

I think I have it: in classic WoW, the succubus has a skill called "Subjugate" which allows warlocks to control other demons, but that doesn't make the succubus invisible.

Let's recall the skills of the succubus in classic WoW: 
- Seduce: incapacitates an enemy for 30 seconds, but requires channeling.
- Lash: deals damage.
- Subjugate: subdues a target demon, making it controlled for a while.

But none of these make the succubus invisible.

Perhaps the riddle is about the warlock spell "Vanish" but that's for rogues.

I remember something: in classic WoW, warlocks can use the spell "Shadowmeld" if they are night elves, but that's rare, and it makes the warlock invisible, but the demon is still visible.

So, that doesn't help.

Let's consider the word "perceived" in the riddle. "More common than perceived" might mean that people perceive that warlocks use voidwalkers more, but they actually use succubus more, but because of a skill, the succubus is not perceived when it is summoned.

But what skill makes the succubus not perceived? In classic WoW, when you summon a demon, it is visible, but if you use the demon for seduce, it is still visible, but if you are in combat, it might be busy.

Perhaps the skill is "Lash" but that doesn't make it common.

I think I found the answer online after a quick search in my memory. In classic WoW, the succubus has a skill called "Seduce" which is used for crowd control, but when you use seduce, the succubus is channeling on the target, so it is not following you, so it is not seen with you. Therefore, when warlocks are using succubus for seduce, they are not seen with it, so voidwalkers are seen more often because warlocks often use voidwalkers for tanking, and when they use succubus, it's not visible.

But that doesn't explain why most warlocks are seen with voidwalkers. It just means that when warlocks are using succubus, they are not seen with it, so voidwalkers are seen when they are not using succubus.

But why would warlocks not use succubus most of the time? Because for leveling and questing, succubus is better, so they should use it most of the time, so why are they seen with voidwalkers?

Perhaps because for some quests, tanking is needed, so they use voidwalkers, and for other quests, they use succubus, but when they use succubus, it's not seen, so voidwalkers are seen more.

But that doesn't make most warlocks seen with voidwalkers.

Another idea: perhaps the skill is "Subjugate" which allows warlocks to control other demons, so warlocks often use succubus to control other demons, but when they control other demons, they have the succubus summoned, but it is not seen because it is busy controlling, so voidwalkers are seen.

But that doesn't make sense.

Let's think about the riddle again: "why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though the succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing?"

And the answer is "because a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived."

So, the skill makes the succubus more common than perceived, meaning that people think succubus are less common, but they are actually common because of this skill.

But why are warlocks seen with voidwalkers? Because when warlocks use succubus, they are not seen with it due to this skill, so voidwalkers are seen.

So, what skill makes the warlock not seen with the succubus? In classic WoW, when you use "Seduce", the succubus is channeling on the target, so it is not following you, so it is not seen with you. Therefore, if warlocks are using seduce frequently, they are not seen with the succubus, so voidwalkers are seen more often.

But for leveling and questing, warlocks use seduce often to control mobs, so they are often not seen with the succubus, so most warlocks are seen with voidwalkers.

That seems to be the answer.

But the riddle says "makes them more common than perceived" so "them" refers to warlocks or to succubus? If "them" refers to warlocks, then the skill makes warlocks more common than perceived, but that doesn't make sense.

If "them" refers to succubus, then the skill makes succubus more common than perceived, meaning that people perceive that succubus are less common, but they are actually common because warlocks use them often, but when they use them, they are not seen, so people perceive them as less common, but they are common.

So, the skill of seduce makes warlocks use succubus often, but when they use it, it is not seen, so people think warlocks use voidwalkers more, but they actually use succubus more.

So, most warlocks are seen with voidwalkers because when they use succubus, it is not seen.

So, the answer is because of the seduce skill of the succubus.

So, for the answer, I should say "because of the seduce skill" or something.

The riddle says "a skill of succubus" so it's seduce.

So, the concise answer is "because of the seduce skill."

But let's confirm: in classic WoW, the succubus has seduce, which is used for crowd control, and when used, the succubus is not following the warlock, so it is not seen.

Therefore, warlocks are most seen with voidwalkers because when they use succubus, it is not seen.

So, the answer is "because of the seduce skill
