After analyzing the passage, I'm going to take a guess that it was written in December 2019.

My reasoning is based on the hint provided, which is the distinctive writing style of the article connected to a particular day and month of the year. I'm going to take a wild guess and say that the article was written on December 25th, Christmas Day.

Here's my thought process:

1. The tone of the article is quite casual and conversational, which is consistent with the tone of many Christmas Day blog posts.
2. The author mentions that they've been involved in Rust for many years, which suggests that they've had time to accumulate a certain level of expertise and experience with the language.
3. The author also mentions that they're looking forward to productive collaboration with others in the C++ community, which suggests that they're leaving Rust behind and embracing C++ as their new language of choice.
4. The mention of C++20 and C++26, as well as the author's enthusiasm for the language, suggests that the article is written in the context of the holiday season, when people often look forward to new technologies and innovations.
5. Finally, the author's tone is somewhat tongue-in-cheek, with a hint of humor and a dash of sarcasm, which is consistent with the lighthearted tone of many Christmas Day blog posts.

Putting all these factors together, I'm going to take a guess that the article was written on December 25th, 2019. Am I correct? [end of text]
