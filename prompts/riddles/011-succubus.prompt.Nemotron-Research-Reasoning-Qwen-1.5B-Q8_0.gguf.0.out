Alright, let's try to figure out this riddle. So the question is about warlocks and voidwalkers and succubus. The hint says it's because a skill of succubus makes them more common than perceived. I need to answer concisely.

First, I know that in game design, skills can have different effects. The succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and quests. But the riddle says most warlocks are seen with voidwalkers even though succubus is better for leveling. So why is that?

The hint mentions that it's because of a skill of succubus making them more common. So maybe the succubus skill somehow makes warlocks more common or easier to find?

Wait, perhaps the succubus skill allows for a different kind of play where warlocks are more prevalent. Maybe because the skill makes it easier to use or more common in certain situations.

Alternatively, maybe the succubus skill allows for a more versatile or common role in combat or other aspects, making warlocks more prevalent than they seem.

So putting it together: The answer is that the succubus skill allows warlocks to be more common than initially perceived because of its specific effect.

But the answer needs to be concise. The answer given in the previous response was "The succubus skill allows warlocks to be more common than initially perceived." But since the answer needs to be concise and answer concisely, perhaps just state it in a short sentence.

Wait the user provided an answer concisely as "it's because a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived." So perhaps the answer is that.

But the answer needs to be concise. So maybe "The succubus skill makes warlocks more common than perceived." Or perhaps "because of the succubus skill making them more common."

But the answer should be concise and answer the question. The question is why most warlocks are seen with voidwalkers even though succubus is better for leveling.

So perhaps the answer is that the succubus skill allows for more common use of voidwalkers, or that voidwalkers are seen as more common because of the succubus.

Alternatively, maybe voidwalkers are seen as more common because of the succubus skill making them more prevalent.

But the hint says it's because of a skill of succubus making them more common than perceived. So perhaps the answer is that the succubus skill makes warlocks more common.

So perhaps the answer is "Because the succubus skill makes warlocks more common than voidwalkers are perceived."

But the answer needs to be concise. So perhaps the answer is "Because the succubus skill makes warlocks more common than voidwalkers."

But let me think again.

The riddle is: In classic wow, why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though the succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing?

So the answer is that because of the succubus skill, warlocks are seen with voidwalkers more often than they should be.
