Based on careful analysis of the content, tone, and specific references in this passage, I believe this was written in **April 2024**.

Here's my reasoning:

**Key Technical Evidence:**
- The author mentions "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines" - C++26 was the upcoming standard at this time
- References to "Herb Sutter cppfront" - This project was actively discussed in early 2024
- The mention of "Carbon language" - Google's Carbon experiment was still being discussed but had largely fizzled out by mid-2024

**Community Context Clues:**
- The specific criticisms of Rust community culture align with discussions that peaked in early 2024
- The reference to "the C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor" suggests the author was contrasting recent negative experiences

**Strategic Timing:**
- The tone suggests someone who had been involved in Rust for years but was making a public shift - this aligns with the wave of developers who experimented with Rust in its early years and were reassessing their commitment by 2024
- The mention of "Linebender projects" - this appears to be a fictional project name used to illustrate the broader industry trend of some developers moving away from Rust

**External References:**
- The discussion of C++ evolution pace vs Rust's "sedate" pace reflects the state of both languages in early 2024
- Stroustrup's safety paper was indeed published and discussed around this timeframe

The April 2024 timing makes sense as it would be when developers were actively planning projects for the remainder of the year and making language decisions, and when the C++ community was particularly energized about upcoming features. [end of text]
