A nostalgic WoW riddle!

**Answer:**
Most Warlocks are seen with Voidwalkers despite Succubi being better for leveling/questing because of the Succubus's **Seduction** skill. This skill, which puts a target to sleep, often causes the Succubus to be **killed by mobs** (who break out of the seduction effect and retaliate) or **accidentally pull additional mobs** (attracted by the brief, interrupted seduction), leading to more frequent pet deaths. As a result, Warlocks tend to use Voidwalkers more in open-world scenarios to avoid the hassle, making Voidwalkers more visibly common in the game world. [end of text]
