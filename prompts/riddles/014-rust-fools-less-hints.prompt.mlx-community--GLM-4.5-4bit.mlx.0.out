==========
This is a fascinating and tricky piece of text. A surface-level reading suggests a recent date, but a deeper analysis reveals several contradictions and clues that point to a specific, and likely fictional, timeframe.

My best guess is that this passage was written on **April 1, 2023**.

Here is a thoughtful, step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning, moving from the obvious clues to the more subtle ones that solidify this conclusion.

### Step 1: Initial Analysis & Contradictions (The "Outside the Box" Part)

The first step is to treat this not as a genuine opinion piece, but as a constructed text. The author's arguments are a perfect, almost caricatured, distillation of common pro-C++ and anti-Rust talking points from online discourse. This level of "perfect" argumentation is a major red flag.

*   **The "Perfect" C++ Advocate:** The author hits every single point a C++ partisan might make: build system choice, downplaying memory safety, praising C++'s rapid evolution, and criticizing the Rust community's culture. It's too comprehensive to be a simple personal blog post; it reads like a manifesto designed to provoke.
*   **The "Perfect" Rust Villain:** The portrayal of the Rust community is equally stereotypical: "imperious," demanding rewrites, and focused on "politics" like Codes of Conduct. This is a common criticism from certain online circles, but presenting it so bluntly is a sign of satire, not sincere analysis.
*   **The "Linebender" Anomaly:** This is the most critical clue. The author claims to be moving the "Linebender projects" from Rust to C++. However, a quick search reveals that **Linebender is a real, well-known collective in the Rust ecosystem**. They are the creators of major, foundational Rust GUI and graphics crates like `piet`, `druid`, and `kurbo`. These projects are not only written in Rust but are deeply dependent on its features (like async, which the author dismisses). The idea that the Linebender collective would abandon Rust for C++ is not just unlikely; it's absurd. This single fact reveals the text is not a genuine account but a fictional one, likely using a real project's name for verisimilitude and to maximize the joke's impact on the target audience.

### Step 2: Pinpointing the Date Using Contextual Clues

Assuming this is a fictional, satirical piece, the next step is to determine *when* it was written by looking for the most recent "real-world" anchor points mentioned in the text.

1.  **The C++26 Clue:** The author mentions looking forward to C++26 features like "stackful coroutines" and "a safe range-based for loop." The timeline for C++ standards is well-defined.
    *   C++20 was released in December 2020.
    *   C++23 was finalized in 2023 and published in 2024.
    *   The next standard is C++26, which is currently (as of my knowledge cutoff) in the drafting and feature proposal stage.
    *   For someone to be writing about C++26 with anticipation, it must be after C++23's features were largely locked in, and the community's focus had shifted to the next version. This places the writing firmly in **2023 or 2024**.

2.  **The "Carbon" Clue:** The author mentions "the new C++ compatible Carbon language." Carbon was publicly announced by Google in July 2022. For it to be referenced as a known entity in a piece like this, the text must have been written **after July 2022**.

3.  **The "Herb Sutter cppfront" Clue:** The author mentions Herb Sutter's `cppfront` experimental compiler, which explores a new syntax for C++. Sutter has been actively developing and discussing this project since around 2021. Its inclusion as a notable "exciting change" suggests the text is written when this project was a hot topic of discussion in the C++ world, which was certainly the case throughout **2022 and 2023**.

### Step 3: Synthesizing the Clues and Reaching the Conclusion

Let's assemble the evidence:

*   **It's Satire:** The use of the real "Linebender" project name proves this is a fictional, provocative piece, likely intended as an elaborate joke or troll post.
*   **The Target Audience:** It's written for people who follow the Rust/C++ language wars, making platforms like Hacker News and Reddit (which are explicitly mentioned at the end) the perfect distribution channels.
*   **The Timeframe:** The references to C++26, Carbon, and `cppfront` all converge on a window in **2023**. The text is written with enough knowledge of C++23's finalization to look forward to C++26, but not so far in the future that these references would be dated.

Now, why April 1?

April Fools' Day is the traditional day for the tech community to post elaborate, plausible-but-false articles, blog posts, and project announcements. This text fits the genre perfectly:
*   It's technically detailed enough to be believable at a glance.
*   It's based on a real and ongoing debate (Rust vs. C++).
*   It takes a controversial and extreme stance.
*   It uses a real project's name to lend it authenticity.
*   Its purpose is to provoke a reaction and generate discussion (as evidenced by the "Discuss on..." links).

A post like this, dropped on April 1, 2023, would be perfectly timed. The C++23 standard would be fresh in people's minds, the discussion about C++26 would be ramping up, and the Rust community was (and is) a large and active target for such a prank. The author gets to have their cake and eat it too: crafting a perfect troll post that also serves as a sharp satire of online language discourse.

Therefore, considering all the evidence—the satirical nature, the critical "Linebender" clue, the specific technological references, and the cultural context of online pranks—the most logical and well-supported guess for the date this was written is **April 1, 2023**.
