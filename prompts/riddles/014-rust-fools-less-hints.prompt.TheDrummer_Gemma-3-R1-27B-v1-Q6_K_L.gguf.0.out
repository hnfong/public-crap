Okay, this is a fun puzzle! Here's my breakdown and best guess for the date, with reasoning. It's more complex than just looking for explicit dates.

**Key Clues & Reasoning:**

1.  **Rust's Evolution & Features:**
    *   The author contrasts Rust's recent feature pace ("sedate") with C++'s rapid evolution. Specifically, they mention:
        *   **Generic Associated Types (GATs):**  These were stabilized in Rust **1.63.0, released February 23, 2023**. The author describes them as "making combinations of existing features work as expected" rather than fundamentally new. This is a very accurate characterization of how GATs were perceived at the time.
        *   **"Type alias impl trait":** This feature was still under heavy discussion and development in early 2023. It wasn't stabilized until **Rust 1.76.0, released February 29, 2024**. The author's description of it as "similar" to GATs (improving existing combinations) is spot-on for the pre-stabilization discussion.
        *   **Async:** Mentioned as a "major effort" that's *already* happened. Async was a huge undertaking that culminated in stable features around **2020-2021**, but the author positions it as something in the past relative to the GAT/type alias discussion.
    *   The author contrasts this with C++'s **C++20** features (modules) and anticipation of **C++26** features (stackful coroutines, etc.). C++20 was finalized in **December 2020**, and C++26 was still in the planning stages. The author's excitement about C++26 features suggests they're looking forward to something that's not yet concrete.

2.  **C++ Features & Context:**
    *   **Modules:** The author states they're looking forward to modules being "implemented fairly soon." While modules were *standardized* in C++20, compiler support was still ramping up significantly in **2023**. The author's phrasing suggests they're anticipating wider adoption.
    *   **C++26 Features:** The specific features mentioned (stackful coroutines, embedded binary files, safe range-based for loop) were actively being discussed and proposed for C++26 in **late 2022 and 2023**.
    *   **Herb Sutter's Paper on Safety:** Bjarne Stroustrup's paper on safety was published in **November 2022**. The author references it as a recent and influential document.
    *   **Carbon Language:** The Carbon experimental language was announced by Microsoft in **July 2022**. The author mentions it as a potential future direction.

3.  **Community Sentiment:**
    *   The author describes the Rust community as "imperious" and "denigrating" other languages. This sentiment was particularly strong in **late 2022 and 2023** as Rust's popularity grew and some vocal proponents became more assertive.
    *   The author's dismissal of diversity/inclusion efforts in programming languages as "politics" is a viewpoint that gained traction in certain tech circles around **2022-2023** as part of broader cultural debates.

4.  **Linebender Project & Call to Action:**
    *   The author is actively seeking people to help with a C++ rewrite. The mention of Hacker News and /r/rust for discussion suggests a public announcement.

**Putting it Together:**

*   The Rust features (GATs, type alias impl trait) and their characterization place the writing *after* February 2023 (when GATs stabilized) and *before* February 2024 (when type alias impl trait stabilized).
*   The C++ features (modules being "soon," C++26 features being discussed, Herb Sutter's paper, Carbon) all align with the **late 2022 - mid 2023** timeframe.
*   The community sentiment and the author's specific complaints about Rust's culture are most reflective of the discussions happening in **late 2022 and 2023**.
*   The active call for C++ contributors suggests the author is making a public announcement to start the rewrite.

**Therefore, my best guess is that this was written in late 2023, most likely between September and December 2023.**

**Why not earlier?** The GATs and type alias discussion is too specific to pre-February 2023.
**Why not later?** The author's excitement about C++26 features and the Carbon language feels like they're still relatively new developments. The timing of the Rust community sentiment also fits better in 2023.

**Important Note:** This is a deduction based on the technical and cultural context. The author could have been writing slightly earlier or later, but the combination of clues points strongly to late 2023.
