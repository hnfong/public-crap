Based on a careful analysis of the technical content, language trends, community dynamics, and references to specific C++ and Rust developments, I can make a strong inference about when this passage was written.

Let’s break it down by key clues:

---

### 1. **C++20 and C++26 Mentions**
- The author mentions **C++20** as having "modules" and being "fairly soon" to be implemented — indicating it's not yet widely adopted.
- They also reference **C++26** as the next version, with features like:
  - Stackful coroutines
  - Embedding binary file contents in arrays
  - A "safe range-based for loop"
- These are speculative or early-proposal-level features at the time of writing.

> **C++20 was officially released in December 2020**, but compiler support (especially for modules) was spotty through 2021–2023. The mention of modules as "innovative" and "soon to be implemented" suggests the author is writing **after 2020 but before full adoption**, likely **2021–2023**.

> **C++26** was still in the very early proposal phase during **2022–2023**, with many of the mentioned features (like stackful coroutines) being discussed but not finalized.

---

### 2. **Rust Features Mentioned**
- The author criticizes recent Rust features:
  - **Generic Associated Types (GATs)** — landed in **Rust 1.65 (November 2022)**
  - **"Type alias impl trait" (TAIT)** — was in development for years, but **landed in Rust 1.75 (December 2023)**

> The fact that GATs are described as recently landed and TAIT as "forthcoming" suggests the article was written **after late 2022 (post-GATs)** but **before late 2023 (pre-TAIT stabilization)**.

So likely: **early to mid-2023**

---

### 3. **Herb Sutter’s `cppfront` and C++ Syntax Reform**
- The author references **Herb Sutter’s `cppfront`**, a new experimental C++-compatible language/syntax with a transpiler.
- `cppfront` was **announced in February 2023** and gained attention throughout 2023.
- The mention of it as a notable upcoming change aligns with **2023**.

Also mentioned: **Carbon**, Google’s experimental C++ successor. Carbon was announced in **July 2022**, and active through 2023, but never gained massive traction.

> This reinforces a **2023 timeframe**, when both `cppfront` and Carbon were fresh topics in C++ circles.

---

### 4. **Linebender Projects**
- Linebender is a real Rust-based GUI initiative (e.g., Druid, Piet, etc.).
- The author claims they are **considering a rewrite in C++**, which has **not happened** as of 2024.
- There is **no public record** of Linebender migrating to CMake or C++.
- This suggests the post is either **satirical**, **fictional**, or **a hoax** — or at least not reflective of actual project direction.

Moreover, the tone is **highly polemical**, especially in the "Community" section.

---

### 5. **Tone and Satirical Red Flags**
Let’s look at the **community section**:
- Claims the **Rust community is "imperious"** and demands rewrites in Rust.
- Says the **C++ subreddit is "well known for their sense of humor"** — which is **deeply ironic**, as r/cpp is often seen as dry and technical, while r/cpp_questions and others can be unwelcoming.
- Claims **"programming languages should be free of politics"** and dismisses diversity efforts.
- Says **"we have moved beyond prejudice and discrimination"** — a statement so out of touch it's almost certainly **satirical**.

> This reads like a **parody** of anti-Rust, pro-C++ sentiment — possibly mocking the kind of arguments made by detractors of inclusive tech communities.

Also, the **conclusion invites people to join a Zulip instance** and says "Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust" — which is **meta**, as if the author expects this post to be shared *there*.

This is a **classic format of a blog post meant to go viral on tech forums** — written in the style of a real announcement, but with enough absurd or exaggerated takes to suggest satire.

---

### 6. **Zulip and Hacker News Culture**
- The use of **Zulip** (rather than Discord or Slack) is common in Rust and open-source communities.
- The call to "Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust" is **self-referential** — it assumes the post will be posted *there*, which is typical of **deliberately provocative tech blog posts**.

This meta-commentary suggests the piece was written **for consumption in 2023 tech discourse**.

---

### Final Inference

Putting it all together:

- **C++20 modules**: post-2020
- **GATs in Rust**: post-November 2022
- **TAIT not yet landed**: pre-December 2023
- **cppfront announced**: February 2023
- **Carbon active**: 2022–2023
- **Satirical tone, likely parody of C++ nostalgia and anti-DEI rhetoric**

The most likely date is: **June to September 2023**

Why?

- Enough time after GATs (late 2022) and cppfront (Feb 2023) for them to be known
- Before TAIT was stabilized (Dec 2023)
- Peak discourse around C++ modernization and Rust safety debates
- Height of online debates about language communities, CoCs, and "politics in tech"

---

### Final Answer:
**Best guess: July 2023**

This passage was most likely written in **mid-2023**, and is **probably a satirical or parody piece** mocking certain anti-Rust, pro-C++, and anti-diversity sentiments in the programming community — disguised as a sincere blog post about migrating a project from Rust to C++. [end of text]
