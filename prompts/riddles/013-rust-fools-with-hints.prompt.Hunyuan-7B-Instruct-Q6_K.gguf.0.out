The passage appears to have been written in **November 2022**. Here's how I arrived at this conclusion, using the distinctive writing style of the article as a key hint:

### Key Observations and Analysis:
1. **Writing Style and Tone**:
   - The tone of the article is thoughtful, analytical, and somewhat formal, with a focus on technical details and comparisons between Rust and C++.
   - The author uses a structured approach, breaking the content into clear sections (e.g., "Choice of Build Systems," "Safety," "Language Evolution," etc.), which is characteristic of a thoughtful and deliberate writing style.
   - The use of phrases like "I’ve been involved in Rust and the Rust community for many years now" and "I do not think this will be a big problem in practice" suggests a reflective and experienced tone, which is common in articles written by experienced developers.

2. **Reference to C++20 and C++26**:
   - The article mentions C++20 and C++26, which were released in **November 2022** and **April 2024**, respectively. By referencing these upcoming features, the author likely wrote the article in **November 2022**, as it would make sense to discuss the upcoming C++20 features at that time.

3. **Cultural and Community Context**:
   - The article references the Rust community's reputation for being "imperious" and its policies promoting diversity. This kind of tone and perspective is likely more prevalent in the Rust community during the period it was gaining significant traction in 2022, as the language was still evolving and facing criticism.

4. **Date of Writing and Publication**:
   - The article ends with a call to action, inviting people to join a Zulip instance and discuss the project on Hacker News and the Rust subreddit. This suggests the article was likely published in a way that aligns with the Rust community's typical communication patterns, which often involve active discussions and collaboration.

### Why November 2022?
- **C++20 Release**: The mention of C++20 as an upcoming feature is a strong indicator that the article was written in November 2022, as C++20 was released in that month.
- **Rust's Growth**: By November 2022, Rust had gained significant traction, and the community was actively discussing its evolution and challenges. The tone of the article reflects a deep understanding of both Rust and C++ ecosystems, which would be more likely during this period.
- **Cultural Context**: The article's critique of the Rust community's behavior and its advocacy for diversity aligns with the cultural and political climate of the Rust community during this time.

### Conclusion:
The distinctive writing style, references to upcoming C++ features, and alignment with the cultural and community context of 2022 strongly suggest that the article was written in **November 2022**.
