To estimate when this passage was likely written, let's analyze the key clues in the text:

1. **C++ Language Features Mentioned**:
   - C++20 is mentioned as recently adopted ("brought us modules"), suggesting the timeframe is post-2020 (C++20 was finalized in 2020).
   - C++26 features are referenced as "looking forward," implying the writing is before C++26's release (likely 2023-2025, as C++26 is expected around 2026).

2. **Rust Ecosystem Observations**:
   - The author notes Rust's pace of innovation has "become more sedate" compared to earlier rapid changes, suggesting this is after Rust's initial hype cycle (2015-2020).
   - Mentions "generic associated types" (stabilized in Rust 1.65, released October 2022) and "type alias impl trait" (a long-discussed but not yet stabilized feature as of mid-2023).

3. **Build Systems**:
   - Criticism of Cargo's monoculture and preference for CMake/Meson align with ongoing debates in cross-platform C++ development (especially in GUI/toolkit spaces), common in the late 2010s/early 2020s.

4. **Community & Social Context**:
   - Reference to "Hacker News and /r/rust" for discussion suggests a tech-focused audience in the 2020s.
   - The author's critique of Rust's "code of conduct" and "policies promoting diversity" mirrors debates that peaked around 2020-2022 (e.g., the Rust Foundation's 2021 Code of Conduct enforcement).

5. **Technical Projects**:
   - Focus on 2D graphics/GUI toolkits (e.g., "Linebender projects") aligns with Rust's GUI ecosystem maturing post-2020 (e.g., egui, Slint).

**Most Probable Date**: Late 2022 to early 2023.  
- The C++26 speculation fits late 2022 (when planning for C++26 was underway).  
- Rust 1.65 (Oct 2022) is referenced, and "type alias impl trait" was a hot topic in early 2023.  
- The tone reflects post-2020 Rust/C++ ecosystem tensions, not yet outdated (e.g., Carbon was announced in 2021, and modules were still nascent in 2022).  

**Alternative Consideration**: Could it be late 2021? Unlikely, because:
- C++20's modules were still very new then, and C++26 would seem too distant to speculate about.  
- Rust 1.65's features weren't yet stabilized.  

Thus, **mid-2023 (before C++26's direction solidified)** is the most precise guess, but **early 2023** is the safest bet given the evidence.  

**Final Answer**: Likely written in **early 2023**.  

*(Note: If this were real, it might align with the Rust GUI ecosystem's growing pains in 2022-2023, such as the egui/wgpu integration debates.)* [end of text]
