Based on the conversation, it seems that Bob ate aged organic milk mixed with seasoned tomato purée and spread on baked whole wheat. Here's a breakdown of the information:

1. Alice asks if Bob is eating healthy.
2. Bob replies that he is, and provides a description of his meal: aged organic milk mixed with seasoned tomato purée and spread on baked whole wheat.
3. Alice expresses surprise upon seeing the photo of his meal.
4. The reaction from Alice suggests that she may not have expected such a meal to be considered healthy.

From this, it can be inferred that Bob's meal consists of organic dairy products, tomato purée, and whole wheat bread, which are generally considered healthy ingredients. However, the specific ingredients of the tomato purée (such as spices or condiments) and the cooking method (baked whole wheat) may affect the overall healthiness of the meal. Without more information, it's difficult to determine whether Bob's meal was completely healthy or not. [end of text]
