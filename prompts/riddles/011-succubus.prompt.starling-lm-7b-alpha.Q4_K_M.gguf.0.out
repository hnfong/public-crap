The reason most warlocks in classic WoW are seen with voidwalkers instead of succubi, even though the succubus is generally a better choice for leveling and questing, is due to a skill of the succubus that makes them less common than they appear.

The skill in question is called "Summon Demonsteed," which allows the warlock to summon a demonsteed mount in addition to their normal demon summon. This mount is a powerful and fast mode of transportation, making it highly sought after by players. However, in order to summon the demonsteed, the warlock must first summon a succubus, which takes up one of their two available demon slots.

As a result, many warlocks choose to forgo the succubus in favor of a voidwalker, which is a more versatile and offensive demon that can provide valuable crowd control and damage output. While the succubus may be a better choice for leveling and questing overall, the demand for the demonsteed mount outweighs the benefits of the succubus, leading to the prevalence of voidwalkers among warlocks in classic WoW.

In summary, the reason most warlocks in classic WoW have voidwalkers instead of succubi is due to the popularity of the demonsteed mount, which requires a succubus to be summoned first.

Here are some additional tips for warlocks in classic WoW:

1. Focus on building up your Soul Shard and Soul Link talents, as they provide significant benefits for both leveling and PvP.
2. Make use of your Demonic Fury ability to maximize the damage output of your spells and abilities.
3. Learn to manage your mana effectively, as warlocks can be susceptible to running out of mana if not careful.
4. Take advantage of your various crowd control abilities, such as Fear and Banish, to keep enemies in check during battles.
5. Always keep an eye on your health and mana, as warlocks can be vulnerable if they are unable to cast spells due to low resources.

By following these tips and understanding the reasons behind the popularity of voidwalkers over succubi, you can become a more effective warlock in classic WoW.
