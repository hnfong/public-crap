Okay, this is a fun challenge! Here's my breakdown and best guess for the date this passage was written, along with my reasoning.

**Key Clues & Reasoning:**

1. **C++20 Mention & Anticipation of C++26:** The passage explicitly mentions C++20 (released in 2020) and looks forward to C++26 (which would be released in 2026). This is a *huge* clue. The author is clearly writing *after* C++20 has been released, but still some time before C++26. This narrows the window considerably.

2. **"Herb Sutter cppfront" Proposal:** The mention of Herb Sutter's "cppfront" proposal is significant. This proposal aimed to modernize C++ syntax and was actively being discussed and developed in the late 2010s and early 2020s.  It gained significant traction around 2021-2022.

3. **Carbon Language:** The mention of the Carbon language (a new C++ compatible language) is another strong indicator. Carbon was announced by Google in 2022. The fact that it's mentioned here suggests the writing occurred *after* that announcement.

4. **Rust's "Sedate" Pace of Innovation:** The author contrasts Rust's slower pace of innovation with C++'s rapid adoption of new features. The specific examples given (generic associated types, "type alias impl trait") suggest a point in time where Rust's evolution felt less groundbreaking compared to C++. This was a sentiment that gained traction around 2022-2023.

5. **Zulip Mention:** The call to action to join a Zulip instance is a good indicator of a more modern communication platform. Zulip gained popularity in the 2010s and 2020s.

6. **Community Tone & Critique of Rust:** The author's critique of the Rust community ("imperious," demanding rewrites) and their desire to leave it reflects a specific dynamic that became more pronounced in the Rust community around 2022-2023. There was a growing perception of gatekeeping and a sometimes overly zealous push for Rust adoption.

7. **Android CVE Mention:** The author mentions having been responsible for CVEs in font parsing code in Android. This suggests experience with Android development, which is a long-standing field.

**Putting it All Together:**

Considering all these clues, the most likely timeframe for this passage is **late 2022 or early to mid 2023.**

*   **After C++20:**  The author is writing after C++20's release.
*   **After Carbon Announcement:** The mention of Carbon places it after Google's announcement in 2022.
*   **During Rust Community Critique:** The observations about the Rust community align with the criticisms that surfaced around 2022-2023.
*   **Before C++26:** The anticipation of C++26 keeps it before 2026.



**Therefore, my best guess is that this passage was written in late 2022 or early to mid 2023.** [end of text]
