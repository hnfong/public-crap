Here's a concise explanation for the clerk's advice:

**The clerk said "Be sure to cover it when you leave your house" likely because:**

* **Unattended crystal balls in folklore and superstition** are believed to:
	1. **Attract unwanted attention** from malevolent spirits or entities.
	2. **Continue to "see" or **reflect the surroundings**, potentially:
		* Revealing secrets or visions to others (unintended recipients).
		* Absorbing negative energies from the empty house.

**By covering it, the woman prevents:**

* Unwanted spiritual interactions
* Potential negative energy accumulation
* Unintended revelations or influences while she's away

**The clerk's brief response "Why? Spirits?" implies:**

* The woman's question was on the right track (spirits are a concern).
* The clerk chose not to elaborate further, perhaps to avoid:
	+ Scaring the customer
	+ Appearing overly superstitious
	+ Encouraging further, potentially unsettling, conversation [end of text]
