Got it, let's try to figure this out. The question is about why Warlocks in classic WoW often use Voidwalkers instead of Succubi, even though Succubi are supposedly better for leveling/questing. The hint says it's because of a Succubus skill that makes them more common than perceived? Wait, maybe I need to think about the skills each has.

First, what do Voidwalkers and Succubi do. Voidwalkers are tanks, right? They have high health, can tank mobs. Succubi have damage over time (DoT) with Siphon Life, maybe魅魔 (Succubus) has Seduce, which is a crowd control (CC) skill—like charming a mob so it attacks nothing. Oh, Seduce is a big one. But wait, the hint says a skill of the succubus that makes them more common than perceived? Or maybe the opposite—why aren't they using Succubi more if they're better? Wait, maybe the problem is that Seduce has a downside? Or maybe Voidwalkers have a skill that's better for questing?

Wait, no, the question says "why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though the succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing?" So the user is saying Succubi are better, but people use Voidwalkers. The hint is a Succubus skill that makes them more common than perceived? Maybe I'm mixing up. Let me recall classic WoW Warlock pets. Warlocks have three main pets: Voidwalker (tank), Succubus (damage/CC), Imp (fire damage).

Succubus has Seduce: targets a humanoid, charmed for 30 seconds (I think), can't attack, but if you get too far, it breaks. Also Siphon Life, which heals the Warlock over time. Voidwalker has Shadow Ward (reduces damage taken by the Warlock), and can tank multiple mobs. For leveling, questing usually involves killing mobs, maybe some humanoids. Seduce is great for single target, but if there are multiple mobs, a Voidwalker can tank them all, while a Succubus might get overwhelmed if you have more than one mob, because Seduce only works on one humanoid (and maybe not on non-humanoids? Wait, does Seduce work on non-humanoids in classic? I think no, Seduce is only humanoids. So if a quest has non-humanoid mobs, Succubus can't seduce them, so you have to fight them, and the Succubus might take damage. Voidwalker can tank any mob, so better for groups or non-humanoids.

But the hint says "a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived"? Maybe the user is wrong, or maybe I'm missing a skill. Wait, another thought: maybe Succubi have a higher mana cost to summon or maintain? No, all pets cost the same to summon, I think. Or maybe the Succubus's Seduce is too good, but people don't use them because of something else? Wait, no, the question is why Voidwalkers are more common even though Succubi are better. So the answer must be a downside of Succubi that's a skill. Oh! Wait, Seduce has a cooldown? No, maybe not. Or maybe when you Seduce a mob, if the mob dies, the Succubus takes damage? No, Siphon Life heals her. Wait, maybe the problem is that Succubi are squishier? They have lower health than Voidwalkers, right? So if you have a pack of mobs, the Succubus might die, whereas the Voidwalker can tank longer. But the hint says it's a skill of the succubus.

Wait, another angle: "makes them more common than perceived"—maybe the hint is a misdirection, or maybe the skill is that Succubi are perceived as more common, but actually Voidwalkers are. No. Wait, maybe the Succubus's Seduce is so good that people think they're more common, but in reality, Voidwalkers are used more because of another skill. Wait, the question is why Voidwalkers are seen more even though Succubi are better. So the answer is a skill that Succubi have which is actually a downside? No, the hint says "a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived"—maybe the skill causes them to be seen more, but the user is saying they are NOT more common, so why?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think of classic WoW Warlock pet abilities. Voidwalker: Tank, Shadow Ward (reduces damage to Warlock by 50% for 10 sec, I think). Succubus: Seduce (charm humanoid), Siphon Life (DoT heal), maybe Demonic Aura (increases spell power? No, that's later maybe). Oh! Wait, Seduce only works on humanoids. So if a quest has non-humanoid mobs (like animals, elementals, undead that aren't humanoid), the Succubus can't seduce them, so you have to fight them, and the Succubus is a glass cannon, so she might die, forcing you to resummon, which is a waste of time. Whereas the Voidwalker can tank any mob, so better for general questing where you might encounter mixed mobs. But the hint says "a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived"—maybe the skill is Seduce, but people think Succubi are more common because Seduce is noticeable, but actually Voidwalkers are more used because of their versatility with all mob types. No, the question is why Voidwalkers are seen more even though Succubi are better. The answer is probably that Succubi's Seduce is only effective on humanoids, so against non-humanoids (most quest mobs) they're worse, while Voidwalkers tank anything. But the hint says "a skill of succubus"—maybe the skill is Seduce, which is good but limited, making Succubi less useful overall, hence Voidwalkers are more common. Wait, the user says "succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing"—maybe that's a misconception, but the question states that as a given, so we have to go with why people use Voidwalkers despite that.

Wait, another thought: in classic WoW, when you summon a pet, do you have to keep feeding them? No, pets don't need food. Maybe mana cost? No. Oh! Wait, Succubus has a higher mana cost per second? No, pets don't cost mana to maintain. Wait, maybe the problem is that Seduce can be dispelled? By other players, but in questing, you're alone. Or maybe the Succubus's damage is DoT based, which is slower than the Voidwalker's melee attacks? No, Voidwalkers don't deal much damage, they tank. The Warlock does the damage. So Succubus's Siphon Life heals, which is good, but if the mob is non-humanoid, can't seduce, so mob attacks Warlock and Succubus. Succubus has low health, so dies, Warlock has to fight alone, which is worse than having a Voidwalker tanking. So the skill of the Succubus (Seduce) is only effective on humanoids, making them worse for non-humanoid quests, which are more common, hence Voidwalkers are more seen. That fits the hint: "a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived"—maybe people perceive Succubi as better because Seduce is awesome on humanoids, but in reality, most quests have non-humanoids, so Voidwalkers are more common. So the answer is Seduce only works on humanoids, so Succubi are less useful against non-humanoid mobs (common in quests), making Voidwalkers more prevalent. Concisely: Succubi's Seduce only affects humanoids; most quest mobs are non-humanoid, so Voidwalkers (tank any mob) are more practical.</seed:think>Succubi's Seduce only works on humanoids; most quest mobs are non-humanoid, so Voidwalkers (tank any mob) are more practical for general leveling.
