Based on the content of the passage, I can make an educated guess about when it was written by analyzing several key elements:

### Key Clues:
1. **C++20 and C++26 Mentions**:
   - The passage mentions **C++20** (released in December 2020) and **C++26** (expected around 2026).
   - It also references **modules** (a C++20 feature) and **stackful coroutines** (proposed for C++26).
   - The author expresses excitement about these features being "implemented fairly soon," suggesting they were written after C++20's release but before C++26's finalization.

2. **Carbon Language Mention**:
   - The **Carbon language** (a C++ successor project by Google) was announced in **2021** and is still in development.
   - The passage refers to it as "the new C++ compatible Carbon language," implying it was already in discussion but not yet finalized.

3. **Rust's Edition System and Recent Features**:
   - The passage mentions **generic associated types** (landed in Rust 2018) and **"type alias impl trait"** (a proposed feature, likely referring to the **impl trait in return positions** or similar, which was stabilized in Rust 1.59.0 in **November 2021**).
   - The tone suggests these were recent developments at the time of writing.

4. **Linebender Projects Context**:
   - The **Linebender** projects (a Rust-based 2D graphics library) were active around **2020–2022**, with discussions about migrating to C++ happening in that timeframe.

5. **Community and Social Media References**:
   - The passage mentions **Hacker News** and **/r/rust**, which are still active but were less dominant in earlier years.
   - The tone about Rust's "imperious" community and C++'s "friendliness" aligns with discussions from **2021–2023**, where Rust's culture was frequently debated.

6. **CVEs and Android Font Parsing**:
   - The author references **font parsing CVEs in Android**, which aligns with high-profile vulnerabilities like **CVE-2021-0481** (Android font rendering, disclosed in **2021**).

### Most Likely Timeframe:
- **Late 2021 to Early 2023** is the most plausible window.
  - **C++20 was finalized in 2020**, but the author seems to be writing after its adoption but before C++26's finalization.
  - **Carbon was announced in 2021**, and the passage treats it as a near-future development.
  - **Rust's "type alias impl trait" was stabilized in November 2021**, and the passage seems to reference it as a recent development.
  - The **Linebender migration discussions** were active in **2022**, with some work happening in C++.

### Best Guess:
**Mid-to-Late 2022** is the most likely time. The passage feels like it was written after the excitement of C++20 had settled but before C++26 was finalized, and it references Rust features that were stabilized in late 2021/early 2022.

### Why Not Earlier or Later?
- **Before 2021**: C++20 was too fresh, and Carbon hadn't been announced.
- **After 2023**: C++26 would have been more concrete, and the tone about Rust's culture might have shifted further.

### Final Answer:
This passage was most likely written in **late 2022**. [end of text]
