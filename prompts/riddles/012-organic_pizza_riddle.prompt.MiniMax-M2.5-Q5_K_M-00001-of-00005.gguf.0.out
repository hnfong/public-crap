The conversation is a humorous twist on the classic "healthy food" description. Bob describes his meal in a way that makes it sound elaborate and healthy—aged organic milk, seasoned tomato purée, baked whole wheat—but the photo likely reveals something completely different (perhaps something unappetizing, mundane, or not actually healthy at all). The humor comes from the contrast between the fancy, health-food-sounding description and the reality.

Without seeing the photo, it's impossible to say exactly what Bob actually ate, but the implication is that it's probably not what Alice expected—like maybe it's just plain toast with ketchup, or something gross. As for whether it was healthy, the answer is likely "no"—the elaborate description was just a joke, and the actual food probably wasn't particularly healthy. Alice's "wtf" reaction confirms she's confused or surprised by what she sees. [end of text]
