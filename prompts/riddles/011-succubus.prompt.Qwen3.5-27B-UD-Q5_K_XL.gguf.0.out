The riddle contains a false premise: in Classic WoW, **Succubi are actually the most common pet seen**, not Voidwalkers.

The "skill" referenced is the Succubus's **Seduction** (and its high damage output), which makes it the superior and preferred choice for leveling and questing. Because it is so effective, players almost exclusively use it, making it the most common pet in the game. The Voidwalker is typically only used for tanking in dungeons or specific PvP situations.
