The distinctive writing style of the article, particularly the mention of "C++20 brings us modules, an innovative new feature, and one Iâ€™m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon," suggests that the article was written after March 20, 2023, as this is when C++20 modules were officially standardized. However, the mention of "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies" indicates that the article was written before March 20, 2026, when C++26 is expected to be finalized.

Considering these clues, the most likely date for the article to have been written is March 20, 2024. This date is significant because it is the day when C++20 was officially standardized, marking a major milestone in the language's evolution. The author's excitement about the upcoming features of C++26, which were still in the experimental phase at the time, also aligns with this date.

The hint provided in the question, "Make use of the hint," refers to the specific mention of "C++20 modules" in the article. This detail is a strong indicator of the date, as it directly references a key milestone in the C++ development timeline. By focusing on this detail, we can deduce that the article was written on a date that is both significant for the C++ community and aligns with the author's enthusiasm for the new features of C++20.
