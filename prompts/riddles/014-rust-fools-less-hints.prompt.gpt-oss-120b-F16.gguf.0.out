<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to guess date of passage. It's a rant about moving from Rust to C++. Mentions "Linebender projects". Possibly a real blog post? Let's think.

Linebender is a project? I recall "Linebender" is a Rust GUI toolkit? Actually there is a "linebender" crate? I think there is a "linebender" project by "Raph Levien"? Not sure.

The passage mentions C++20, C++26 (future). C++20 released 2020. C++23 released 2023. C++26 is speculative (maybe 2026). So the author expects C++26 features like stackful coroutines, embed binary file contents, safe range-based for loop. Those are proposals for C++26 (maybe not yet). So the passage likely written after C++20 release (2020) and after some Rust features like generic associated types (GATs) landed (Rust 1.65? Actually GATs stabilized in Rust 1.65 (2022). Type alias impl trait (TAIT) is still unstable? Actually "type alias impl Trait" is still unstable as of 2024? Not stable. So they mention "forthcoming 'type alias impl trait'". That suggests they wrote before it stabilizes (still upcoming). As of 2024, TAIT is still unstable (maybe still not stable). So date likely before stable.

Also they mention "Rust async has been a major effort, but recently landed features such as generic associated types have more of the flavor of making combinations of existing features work as expected rather than bringing any fundamentally new capabilities; the forthcoming 'type alias impl trait' is similar." So they think GATs have recently landed (maybe 2022). So the post likely after GATs stable (2022) but before TAIT stable (still not stable). So maybe 2022-2023.

They also mention "C++20 brings us modules, an innovative new feature, and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon." Modules are still not widely implemented in compilers (GCC 11, Clang 12). So they think modules not yet widely used. That suggests early after C++20 release (2020-2021). But they also mention "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, embed binary file contents, safe range-based for loop". Those proposals are being discussed for C++26 (maybe 2024?). So they are aware of future proposals.

Also they mention "C++ has even more exciting changes to look forward to, including potentially a new syntax as proposed by Herb Sutter cppfront, and even the new C++ compatible Carbon language." Carbon language announced 2022 (by Google). So they mention Carbon as new language. So post after 2022.

They also mention "Stroustrup’s paper on safety is a remarkably wise and perceptive document". That paper? Bjarne Stroustrup wrote "Safety in C++" maybe 2022? Actually there is a paper "Safety in C++" (2022). So they reference that.

They also mention "Rust community can be extremely imperious, constantly demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust". This is a rant.

Also they mention "Zulip instance". So they have a Zulip for the project.

Now we need to guess date. Could be a satirical piece? Might be a fake "anti-Rust" rant posted on Hacker News. Could be a "r/AskReddit" style.

Let's search memory: I recall a known satirical essay "Rust is dead, long live C++" maybe posted on Hacker News around 2023? Not sure.

The mention of "Linebender projects" - I think there is a "Linebender" open-source project for GUI in Rust, maybe by "Raph Levien"? Actually Raph Levien created "linebender" as a 2D graphics library for GUI. He also works on "Raph Levien's linebender"? Not sure.

If we assume it's a real post, we can approximate date: maybe early 2023 (Jan-March). Because by then GATs stable, TAIT still unstable, C++20 modules still not widely used, C++23 just released (2023). They didn't mention C++23 features, only C++20 and upcoming C++26. So maybe before C++23 adoption.

C++23 was released in 2023 (ISO). If the author didn't mention it, maybe before its finalization (mid 2022). But they mention "C++20 brings us modules... looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon." That suggests they are still waiting for modules adoption, which is still 2021-2022.

Thus maybe the post is from 2022, after Rust GATs stable (June 2022). Also after Carbon announcement (Oct 2022). So maybe late 2022.

Also they mention "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, embed binary file contents, safe range-based for loop". Those proposals were being discussed in 2022-2023.

Thus I'd guess date: around November 2022.

But we need a specific date? The question: "make your best guess when (date) this was written." So we can give month and year.

Let's think about the "Zulip instance" - maybe they created a Zulip for the project. Could be early 2023.

Also they mention "Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust." So they posted somewhere else.

Maybe the post is a "Hacker News comment" from 2023-02-15.

But we need to be thoughtful and think outside the box. Could be a generated text by ChatGPT? The style is reminiscent of a "ChatGPT anti-Rust rant" used as a test. Could be a synthetic text created for a dataset. The date could be unknown.

But we can still guess.

Let's examine internal clues: The author says "I’ve been involved in Rust and the Rust community for many years now." So they have experience.

They mention "Linebender projects". Searching memory: There is a "Linebender" crate for Rust UI, part of "linebender" by "Raph Levien"? Actually Raph Levien created "linebender" as a 2D graphics library for UI, used in "Raph Levien's linebender" maybe part of "Raph Levien's UI toolkit". He also works at "Google"? Not sure.

If we google (in mind) "Linebender Rust" we recall a GitHub repo "linebender" by "linebender/linebender". It is a Rust library for UI. The repo maybe created 2022. The author might be "Raph Levien"? He is known for "linebender" and "skia"? Actually Raph Levien works on "linebender" at "Google"? Not sure.

If the author is Raph Levien, he might be writing a blog post about moving to C++. He might have posted on "Raph Levien's blog" around 2023.

But the passage includes many generic statements about C++ and Rust, not specific to his project.

Thus maybe it's a "satire" piece posted on "Hacker News" by a user "linebender" complaining about Rust.

The date could be around "2023-09-01" (when Carbon got attention). But they mention Carbon as new language, which was announced Oct 2022. So after that.

Thus I'd guess: December 2022.

Let's produce answer: "Approximately December 2022 (late 2022)". Provide reasoning.

<|end|><|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Estimated date:** Late 2022 – around December 2022.

**Why this makes sense**

| Clue in the text | What it tells us | Approximate time‑frame |
|------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Rust GATs are “recently landed”** | Generic Associated Types were stabilised in Rust 1.65 (June 2022). | Mid‑2022 or later. |
| **“type‑alias‑impl‑trait” is still “forthcoming”** | TAIT is still unstable (has not been stabilised as of 2024). | Before any future stabilisation – still 2022‑2023. |
| **C++20 modules “look forward to actually being implemented fairly soon”** | Modules were still not widely supported in compilers in 2020‑2021; by 2022 they were just becoming usable. | Early‑to‑mid‑2022. |
| **Mentions of C++26 proposals (stackful coroutines, embed‑binary, safe range‑for)** | Those proposals were being discussed in the C++ standards community in 2022. | 2022. |
| **Reference to Herb Sutter’s *cppfront* and the *Carbon* language** | cppfront was announced early 2022; Carbon was announced Oct 2022. | Must be after Oct 2022. |
| **Reference to Bjarne Stroustrup’s “paper on safety”** | Stroustrup’s safety paper appeared in 2022. | 2022. |
| **No mention of C++23 features** | C++23 was only finalised in mid‑2023; the author never refers to it, suggesting the piece predates its widespread awareness. | Before mid‑2023. |

Putting all of these together points to a window **after mid‑2022 (when GATs landed and Carbon was announced) but before mid‑2023 (when C++23 became the current standard and TAIT was still only “forthcoming”).** The most natural “sweet spot” is the **late‑2022 period**, roughly **December 2022**.
