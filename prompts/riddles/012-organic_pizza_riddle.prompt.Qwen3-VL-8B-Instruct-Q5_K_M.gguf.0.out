Bob ate **aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat** — which sounds like a bizarre, possibly unappetizing, and nutritionally questionable combination.

Let’s break it down:

- **Aged organic milk**: Probably fine — organic milk is healthy, and aging it (like in cheese or yogurt) might add flavor, but “aged milk” as a standalone dish is odd.
- **Seasoned tomato purée**: Tomato purée is healthy — rich in lycopene, fiber, and antioxidants — but “seasoned” could mean heavy on salt, sugar, or oil.
- **Spread on baked whole wheat**: Whole wheat is healthy, but “spread” implies it’s likely a thin layer — maybe like a sandwich or open-faced toast? But “spread” + “baked whole wheat” is ambiguous.

The real issue? The **combination** sounds like a culinary disaster — like a sandwich or open-faced dish where tomato purée is spread on whole wheat, and then aged milk is “tossed over” it. That’s not a standard dish. It’s messy, possibly unappetizing, and might be high in sodium, fat, or sugar depending on the seasoning.

Alice’s reaction — “wtf” — is understandable. It’s not just “unhealthy,” it’s **confusing, unappetizing, and possibly inedible** as described.

**Was it healthy?**  
Technically, the *ingredients* are healthy — organic milk, tomato purée, whole wheat — but the *preparation* and *combination* make it questionable. It’s not a balanced or conventional meal. It might be a joke or a surreal food experiment.

**Conclusion**:  
Bob ate something that sounds like a culinary nightmare — possibly not healthy due to the odd combination, and definitely not appetizing. Alice’s “wtf” is a perfectly reasonable reaction.

**Final Answer**:  
Bob ate a bizarre dish of aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée on baked whole wheat — likely not healthy due to the unbalanced, unappetizing combination, and definitely not something you’d expect to eat. Alice’s “wtf” is justified. [end of text]
