Based on the content of the passage, I would estimate that this text was written **around 2022 or early 2023**. Here's a detailed breakdown of the reasoning:

---

### 1. **C++20 and C++26 Mentioned**
The passage refers to **C++20** and **C++26** as upcoming or recently released versions of the language. 

- **C++20** was officially released in **December 2020**.
- **C++26** is still in the planning and proposal phase, with the first draft expected around **2023–2024**.

This suggests the text was written **after C++20 was released** (so after 2020), but **before C++26 was finalized** (so before mid-2023). That places the writing date **between late 2020 and mid-2023**.

---

### 2. **Rust Language Features**
The passage discusses **generic associated types** and **type alias impl trait**, which are features that were **landed in Rust in 2021 and 2022**, respectively.

- **Generic associated types** were stabilized in **Rust 1.58** (released in **June 2021**).
- **Type alias impl trait** was stabilized in **Rust 1.59** (released in **July 2021**).

This means the author was writing **after these features were stabilized**, which again places the text **after 2021**.

### 3. **C++ Core Guidelines and Safety**
The author mentions the **C++ core guidelines**, which were **formally published in 2019** by Bjarne Stroustrup and others. The passage also references **Stroustrup’s paper on safety**, which was published in **2021**.

This suggests the author was writing **after 2021**, and possibly **during or after the 2022 C++ standards process**.

---

### 4. **Community and Social Media References**
The author mentions **Hacker News** and **Reddit’s /r/rust** as platforms for discussion. These are **long-standing platforms**, but the **tone and context** of the author’s criticism of the Rust community (e.g., "imperious" and "demanding projects be rewritten in Rust") aligns with **public discourse around 2022–2023**, when Rust was gaining more mainstream attention and some community tensions were being discussed.

---

### 5. **Zulip Instance and Project Status**
The author mentions **looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite** and **joining a Zulip instance**. This suggests the project was **in the planning or early development phase**, which is consistent with **2022 or early 2023**, when many Rust projects were transitioning to other languages or exploring alternatives.

---

### 6. **No Mention of C++23 or Later**
The passage does **not** mention **C++23**, which was released in **2023**, nor does it reference **C++24** or **C++25**, which are still in development. This suggests the text was written **before the release of C++23**, placing it **before mid-2023**.

---

### Final Estimate:
Putting all these clues together, the most likely time frame for this passage is **late 2022 or early 2023**. This is the period when the author was **transitioning from Rust to C++**, **critiquing the Rust ecosystem**, and **planning a C++ rewrite** of a project.

---

### Bonus Insight:
The author also mentions **Herb Sutter’s proposal for a new C++ syntax (cppfront)** and the **Carbon language**, which are both **still in development** as of 2024. This further supports the idea that the text was written **before these proposals were finalized or widely adopted**, which would be **after 2022**.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**This passage was most likely written in late 2022 or early 2023.** [end of text]
