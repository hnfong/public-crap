Bob likely sent a photo of **milk curdled and mixed with tomato purée**—essentially, he made a dish resembling **spilled or curdled milk on tomato-based food**, which looks unappetizing or even spoiled.

Here’s why:

- **“Aged organic milk”** → Milk that’s gone sour/curdled (aged = spoiled).
- **“Tossed over seasoned tomato purée”** → Pouring curdled milk onto tomato sauce/purée.
- **“Spread on baked whole wheat”** → Likely meaning on toast or bread.

So Bob *described* it as a fancy dish, but in reality, he probably just ate (or worse—served) **curdled milk on tomato sauce on toast**, which looks like a messy, unappetizing, possibly spoiled concoction—hence Alice’s “wtf”.

Was it healthy?  
❌ **No.**  
- Aged (spoiled) milk can contain harmful bacteria (e.g., *Listeria*, *Salmonella* if not properly fermented/soured).
- While fermented dairy (like yogurt or kefir) is healthy, *spontaneously aged* milk is not.
- Mixing dairy with acidic tomato purée causes curdling—unpleasant texture and potential digestive upset.

So: Bob either misunderstood “healthy” (thinking “organic” + “whole wheat” = healthy regardless of spoilage), or was joking—and Alice’s reaction confirms it looked gross.

TL;DR: Bob ate (or tried to serve) **curdled spoiled milk on tomato toast**—not healthy, and definitely not appetizing. 😬 [end of text]
