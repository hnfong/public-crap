The clerk likely said to cover the crystal ball to protect it from sunlight, which can cause damage or fade its properties, rather than to ward off spirits. However, given the context of an antique shop and the clerk's specific advice, there's a possibility the clerk is hinting at the ball's alleged supernatural properties, suggesting it should be covered to prevent unwanted attention or interference from external energies. The clerk's response about spirits could be a playful or mysterious way of acknowledging the crystal ball's rumored magical or paranormal qualities. 

In summary, the clerk probably meant to protect the ball from sunlight, but the mention of spirits adds an element of mystique to the object's nature. [end of text]
