The clerk's advice to cover the crystal ball when leaving the house likely stems from a superstition or belief that the crystal ball could be sensitive to external influences or energies. This might suggest that the crystal ball could be affected by spirits or other unseen forces if left exposed, potentially leading to unintended consequences or disturbances. The clerk's caution is a way to protect the woman from any potential negative outcomes associated with the crystal ball. [end of text]
