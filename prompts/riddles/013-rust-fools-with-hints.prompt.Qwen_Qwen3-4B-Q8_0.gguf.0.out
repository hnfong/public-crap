The passage was likely written in **April 2023**. Here's how the hint and the content of the passage lead to this conclusion:

### The Hint: Distinctive Writing Style Connected to a Particular Day and Month
The hint suggests that the writing style of the passage is connected to a specific day and month of the year. This is a subtle clue that points to a particular event or occurrence that is associated with a specific date, which is often used in tech communities to mark significant events or milestones.

### Analysis of the Passage
The passage is a personal reflection from someone who has been involved in the Rust community for many years and is now considering a shift to C++. The tone is reflective, critical of Rust's ecosystem, and optimistic about C++'s future. The author is also discussing the potential for a C++ rewrite of the Linebender projects and is inviting others to join the effort.

This kind of reflective and critical post is commonly seen on platforms like Hacker News or Reddit, where developers discuss their experiences and future plans. The author also mentions the C++ community's "sense of humor" and the Rust community's "imperious" nature, which are characteristics often discussed in these forums.

### The Key Clue: The Mention of C++20 and C++26
One of the most telling clues is the mention of **C++20** and the expectation of **C++26**. The C++ standard is released every 3 years, with the most recent version being C++20 (released in 2020). The next major version, C++26, is expected to be released in 2026. However, the passage is written in the present tense, suggesting that the author is writing in 2023, just before the release of C++26.

This is a strong indicator that the passage was written in **2023**, as the author is discussing the upcoming C++26 standard, which would be released in 2026. The author is also discussing the current state of C++ and its future, which aligns with the timeline of 2023.

### The Month: April
The passage also mentions the **C++20 modules** feature, which was a major part of the C++20 standard. The C++20 standard was finalized in December 2020, but the modules feature was not fully implemented in all compilers until later. The author mentions that they are "looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon," which would make sense in **April 2023**, as it was a time when the C++20 modules feature was still in active development and being adopted by various compilers.

Additionally, the author is discussing the future of C++ and the potential for new features like stackful coroutines and range-based for loops in C++26. These are features that were still in the planning stages in 2023, making April a plausible time to write such a forward-looking post.

### Conclusion
The passage was most likely written in **April 2023**. This conclusion is based on the author's discussion of C++20 and the expected release of C++26, as well as the timing of the C++20 modules feature's implementation. The writing style and content of the passage are consistent with a post that would be shared on platforms like Hacker News or Reddit in early 2023, just before the release of C++26. [end of text]
