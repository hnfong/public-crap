Okay, this is a fun one! Here's my breakdown of the clues and my best guess for the date, along with the reasoning:

**Key Clues & Reasoning:**

*   **"C++20 brings us modules..."**: C++20 was *finalized* in December 2020, but widespread compiler support and adoption took time.  The author expresses anticipation for modules being "implemented fairly soon," suggesting this is *after* 2020, but not years later (as modules are now fairly common).
*   **"Looking forward, C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines..."**: C++26 is still in development as of late 2023/early 2024. The author is talking about it as a future expectation, meaning before the standard is finalized (which is expected in 2026).
*   **"The forthcoming “type alias impl trait” is similar."**: This feature was stabilized in Rust 1.75, released November 9, 2023. This is a *very* specific detail. The author is referencing it as something recent.
*   **"Herb Sutter cppfront..."**: cppfront was proposed in late 2021/early 2022, and is still very much a work in progress. Mentioning it suggests awareness of recent, but not *old* developments.
*   **"Stroustrup’s paper on safety..."**: Bjarne Stroustrup published a paper on C++ safety in 2022.
*   **"The Rust community is also known for its code of conduct..."**: The Rust community's focus on code of conduct and diversity has been a significant topic of discussion, and sometimes controversy, in recent years (roughly 2018 onwards, but peaking in the early-mid 2020s). The author's *negative* framing of this suggests they're reacting to a current situation.
*   **"Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust."**: This indicates the author is aware of current online discussion forums.
*   **"I consider myself a good enough programmer that I can avoid writing code with safety problems. Sure, I’ve been responsible for some CVEs (including font parsing code in Android)..."**: This feels like a response to common criticisms of moving *from* Rust to C++, and the author is defending their choice.
*   **"async has been a major effort..."**: Rust's async ecosystem matured significantly around 2020-2022.

**Putting it Together:**

The most crucial clues are the references to Rust 1.75 (November 2023) and C++26 (still in development). The author is clearly aware of very recent developments in both languages. The mention of cppfront and Stroustrup's paper further narrows it down.

**My Best Guess:**

**Late 2023 (November - December)**. 

Specifically, I'd estimate **November/December 2023**. This timeframe accounts for:

*   The recent stabilization of "type alias impl trait" in Rust 1.75.
*   Awareness of C++26 features still being planned.
*   The ongoing discussion around C++ modules and cppfront.
*   The author's reaction to the Rust community's code of conduct, which was still a hot topic.
