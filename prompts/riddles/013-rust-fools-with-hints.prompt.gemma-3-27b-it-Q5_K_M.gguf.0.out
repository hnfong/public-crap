My best guess is **April 1st, 2024**.

Here's my reasoning, heavily relying on the "hint" about a distinctive writing style connected to a specific day and month:

The entire piece reads as a very elaborate, and somewhat pointed, **April Fool's Day** joke. Several elements contribute to this:

* **The contrarian stance:** The author expresses growing frustration with Rust *despite* being deeply involved in its GUI ecosystem, and then enthusiastically embraces C++ â€“ a language often seen as Rust's direct competitor and, historically, a source of many of the problems Rust aims to solve. This is a deliberately provocative position.
* **The self-assuredness about avoiding safety issues:** The author casually dismisses memory safety concerns, claiming their own skill will prevent problems, and downplaying the severity of crashes in GUI applications. This is a highly unusual and somewhat arrogant statement for a seasoned developer, especially given the core principles of Rust.
* **The overly optimistic view of C++ evolution:** The author highlights exciting upcoming C++ features with a level of enthusiasm that feels exaggerated, especially considering C++'s historically slower adoption of modern features.
* **The dismissive attitude towards the Rust community:** The characterization of the Rust community as "imperious" and "denigrating" other languages is a harsh generalization and feels like a deliberate caricature. The claim that computer science has moved beyond prejudice is also a very strong and debatable statement.
* **The overall tone:** The piece has a slightly sarcastic and self-aware tone throughout, as if the author is deliberately setting up a series of predictable reactions.

**The Hint Connection:** April Fool's Day is traditionally a day for elaborate hoaxes and playful reversals of expectations. The author's arguments are so counter to the typical narrative surrounding Rust and C++ that they strongly suggest a deliberate attempt to create a humorous, albeit pointed, "fool" out of the reader. The writing style is deliberately contrarian and provocative, fitting the spirit of the day.

Furthermore, the references to C++20 and C++26 features align with the current timeline of C++ development as of early 2024. The mention of Carbon also places it in the recent past.



Therefore, the most plausible date for this piece is April 1st, 2024, as a well-crafted April Fool's Day prank aimed at the programming community.
