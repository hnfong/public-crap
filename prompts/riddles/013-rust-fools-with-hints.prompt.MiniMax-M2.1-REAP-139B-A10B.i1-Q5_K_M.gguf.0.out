**Answer: April 1, 2024 (April Fool's Day)**

**Explanation**

The passage is written in a deliberately provocative, tongue‑in‑cheek style that mimics the classic “April Fool’s” posts that appear on Hacker News and Reddit every year. The author:

1. **Uses exaggerated, hyperbolic language** (“I’ll be glad to be rid of that”, “the Rust community can be extremely imperious”, “the C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor”). This is a hallmark of the tongue‑in‑cheek genre.

2. **Makes absurd claims** (e.g., “C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines”, “the new C++ compatible Carbon language”, “Stroustrup’s paper on safety”). These are clearly tongue‑in‑cheek exaggerations, not serious technical predictions.

3. **Ends with a call to action** (“Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust”). This is a standard element of April Fool’s posts, which are designed to spark discussion.

4. **References a specific date** (April 1, 2024) in the title and body of the post. This is a tongue‑in‑cheek way of saying the post was written on April Fool’s Day.

5. **Uses a distinctive writing style** that is characteristic of April Fool’s posts: tongue‑in‑cheek, provocative, and designed to elicit reactions from the community.

Therefore, the passage was written on April 1, 2024, which is April Fool's Day. This is a tongue‑in‑cheek way of saying the post was written on April Fool's Day. The distinctive writing style of the article is connected to one particular day and month of the year: April Fool's Day. [end of text]
