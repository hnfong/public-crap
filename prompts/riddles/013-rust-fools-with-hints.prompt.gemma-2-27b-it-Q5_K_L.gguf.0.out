This passage was most likely written on **April 1st**. 

Here's why:

* **Satirical Tone:** The entire piece drips with sarcasm and irony.  Statements like "the Rust community can be extremely imperious, constantly demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust, and denigrating all other programming languages" and "I firmly believe that programming languages should be free of politics, focused strictly on the technology itself" are clearly exaggerated for comedic effect.

* **April Fools' Tradition:**  April 1st is known for pranks and satirical articles. The over-the-top praise of C++ and the thinly veiled criticism of Rust strongly suggest this is a humorous take on the programming language debate.

* **Specific Details:** The mention of "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines" and other future features is likely a fabrication, playing on the stereotype of C++ constantly evolving.

The author is likely using the cover of April Fools' Day to poke fun at both the Rust and C++ communities and the sometimes heated debates surrounding programming language choices.
