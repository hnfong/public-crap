==========
This passage was likely written in **mid-to-late 2023**. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Clues:
1. **C++26 Features**: The author mentions C++26's planned features (stackful coroutines, safe range-based for loop, etc.). The C++26 standard was finalized in **August 2023**, and these features were widely discussed in 2022–2023. The author's optimism about their imminent availability suggests the text was written after the C++26 feature set was finalized but before widespread adoption (likely mid-2023).

2. **Rust's Edition Mechanism**: The author criticizes Rust's edition system for slowing innovation. Rust's 2021 edition was released in late 2021, and the next edition (Rust 2024) was announced in 2023. The author's frustration aligns with the period post-2021 edition but pre-2024 edition (i.e., 2022–2023).

3. **C++ Modules**: The author mentions looking forward to C++20 modules being "implemented fairly soon." While C++20 was finalized in 2020, widespread compiler support (especially for modules) was still maturing in 2022–2023. The author's tone suggests they were waiting for broader adoption.

4. **Community Sentiment**: The author's critique of the Rust community (e.g., "imperious," "demanding rewrites") and praise for the C++ community (e.g., "sense of humor" on Reddit) reflects tensions that were particularly visible in 2022–2023, as Rust's popularity grew and debates about its adoption became more polarized.

5. **Linebender Projects**: The author mentions "Linebender projects," which is likely a reference to organizations like *Ferus Games* or *Linebender* (known for projects like *FemtoGUI* or *Slint*). These projects were actively discussing C++ rewrites in 2023.

6. **Carbon Language**: The author mentions Carbon as a "new C++ compatible language." Carbon was announced by Google in July 2023, making this a strong upper bound for the date.

### Conclusion:
The most plausible timeframe is **mid-to-late 2023**, after C++26's features were finalized but before widespread C++26 adoption (and while Carbon was still new). The author's optimism about C++'s future and frustration with Rust's pace aligns with this period. 

If forced to pick a single month, **August–September 2023** seems most likely, as it coincides with C++26's finalization and Carbon's announcement.
