The passage references several key details that help narrow down the timeframe:

1. **C++20 and C++26**: The author mentions C++20 features (like modules) and looks forward to C++26, which suggests the text was written after C++20 was finalized (December 2020) but before C++26 was released (expected around 2026). Since C++26 was still in the future at the time of writing, the text likely predates 2026.

2. **Rust's feature pace**: The author criticizes Rust's innovation pace, noting that features like generic associated types (GATs) and "type alias impl trait" (TAIT) have landed recently. GATs were stabilized in Rust 1.65 (November 2022), and TAIT was stabilized in Rust 1.68 (March 2023). This suggests the text was written after these features stabilized, likely in 2023 or early 2024.

3. **Carbon language**: The author mentions Carbon, a proposed C++-compatible language, which was announced in July 2022. Since Carbon is still experimental and not widely adopted, the text likely predates widespread awareness of its decline (which became more apparent in 2023–2024).

4. **Tone and context**: The author expresses frustration with Rust's community and safety guarantees, suggesting a shift in sentiment that aligns with mid-to-late 2023, when discussions about Rust's maturity and trade-offs became more prominent in some circles.

### Best Guess:
The passage was likely written in **late 2023 or early 2024**, after Rust 1.68 (March 2023) and C++20's adoption, but before C++26's release or Carbon's decline became widely recognized. The references to recent Rust features and forward-looking C++ developments point to this timeframe. [end of text]
