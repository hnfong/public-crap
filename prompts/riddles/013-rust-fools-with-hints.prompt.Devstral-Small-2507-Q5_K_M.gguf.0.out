The passage mentions several specific details that can help us narrow down the date it was written. One of the most distinctive hints is the mention of "C++20" and its features, such as modules. C++20 was officially released in December 2020. The passage also discusses future C++ versions, including C++26, which suggests it was written after C++20 was released but before C++23 was finalized (C++23 was released in September 2023).

Additionally, the passage mentions "Herb Sutter's cppfront," which is a proposal for a new syntax for C++. This proposal was introduced in 2017 but gained more traction and discussion around 2020-2021.

Given these details, the passage was likely written sometime between late 2020 and early 2023. However, the distinctive writing style and the mention of "Hacker News" and "/r/rust" suggest a more specific time frame. The phrase "Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust" is a common way to invite discussion on these platforms, which were particularly active and influential around 2021.

Considering all these factors, a reasonable guess for the date of the passage would be sometime in 2021. [end of text]
