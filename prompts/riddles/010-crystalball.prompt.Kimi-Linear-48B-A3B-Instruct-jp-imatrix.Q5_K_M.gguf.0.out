The clerk said this because the crystal ball is likely cursed or haunted. Covering it would prevent whatever malevolent spirit or energy trapped within from escaping or causing harm when the woman takes it home. It's a warning based on the shop's knowledge of the object's dark history or supernatural properties.

The clerk's warning is a common trope in supernatural fiction: an object with a dark history or curse needs to be contained or protected. The crystal ball, being an antique and likely used for fortune-telling or scrying, could be a vessel for spirits or negative energy. The clerk, perhaps knowing the object's history or having experienced its effects, is trying to prevent the woman from unleashing something dangerous. The phrase "Be sure to cover it" implies a need for containment, and the woman's question about "Spirits?" shows she already suspects something supernatural, making the clerk's warning more urgent and plausible within the story's context.
