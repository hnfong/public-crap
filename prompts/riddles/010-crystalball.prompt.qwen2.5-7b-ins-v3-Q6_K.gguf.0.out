Alright, I need to figure out why the clerk told the lady to cover her crystal ball when she leaves her house. Let's start by considering the context. The lady bought a crystal ball from an antique shop, which immediately makes me think of the supernatural or magical connotations associated with crystal balls. The clerk's warning to cover it suggests there's something special or potentially dangerous about the crystal ball.

Maybe the clerk believes that the crystal ball has magical properties that could be activated or disturbed if not properly covered. Alternatively, the clerk might be concerned about the crystal ball attracting unwanted attention or even malevolent spirits, hence the advice to cover it to protect both the lady and possibly others.

Another angle could be that the crystal ball is a valuable antique, and the clerk is advising the lady to protect it from dust, moisture, or accidental damage when she takes it home. However, the mention of "spirits" in the lady's question leans more towards a belief in the supernatural rather than just physical protection.

Perhaps the clerk has personal experiences or knowledge about the crystal ball's history, knowing that it has been involved in past incidents where covering it was necessary to prevent negative outcomes. This could be a precautionary measure to ensure the lady's safety and the well-being of her home environment.

There's also the possibility that the crystal ball is part of a larger collection or has specific instructions for its use and storage. The clerk might be following a tradition or set of rules that dictate how such items should be handled to maintain their integrity and prevent any adverse effects.

In summary, the clerk's advice to cover the crystal ball likely stems from a belief in its magical or spiritual significance, aiming to protect the lady from potential negative consequences associated with the crystal ball's use or presence in her home.
