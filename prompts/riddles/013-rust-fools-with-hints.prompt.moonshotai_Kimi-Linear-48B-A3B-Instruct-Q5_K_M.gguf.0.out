The passage was written on **April 1st**.

### Explanation:
The distinctive writing style and tone of the article—particularly its confident, somewhat provocative, and tongue-in-cheek framing—strongly resembles the style of April Fools' Day posts. The author:
- Criticizes Rust in a way that feels exaggerated or performative.
- Praises C++ with a level of enthusiasm that borders on satire.
- Makes sweeping, almost absurd claims (e.g., "I consider myself a good enough programmer that I can avoid writing code with safety problems").
- Ends with a call to action to "join our Zulip instance" and "Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust," which mirrors the kind of self-aware, meta-humor typical of April Fools' content.

This is a classic example of a well-crafted April Fools' post that mimics a serious tech blog post but is clearly meant to be humorous and ironic. [end of text]
