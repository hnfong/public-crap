The passage is a dead-ringer for an April-Fools’ Day post.  
Everything about it is a caricature of the “I’m leaving Rust” genre:

- The author claims to be abandoning Rust for C++ because Cargo is a “monoculture,” while praising the glorious diversity of CMake, Autotools, SCons, etc.  
- He dismisses memory-safety CVEs with “I’m good enough not to do that again” and “GUI crashes aren’t a big deal.”  
- He touts C++20 modules as “innovative” and says C++26 will fix everything, while painting Rust’s steady evolution as stagnant.  
- He ends by longing for the famously warm, welcoming C++ sub-reddit and declares that programming languages should be “free of politics.”

Each paragraph is a perfectly inverted hot-take, delivered with a straight face—classic April 1 satire.  
Therefore the date it was written is:

1 April (any year, but almost certainly 1 Apr 2023, the April-Fools’ Day that followed the Rust 1.68 release and the C++23 final draft). [end of text]
