The clerk's warning is a **practical joke** or a **misdirection** based on the literal nature of the object.

Since the item is a **crystal ball** (a transparent sphere), the clerk is likely implying that if she leaves it uncovered, **people will see through it** (or see her through it) as she walks down the street, making her look foolish or transparent. The humor lies in the woman assuming a supernatural reason ("Spirits?") when the clerk was referring to the physical property of the glass. [end of text]
