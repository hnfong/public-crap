Based on the text, this passage was written on **April 1, 2022**.

Here is the reasoning for this date:

1.  **April Fools' Day (The Nature of the Text):**
    The passage is a satirical piece of "reverse trolling." It takes the common internet trope of "Rewrite it in Rust" and flips it on its head, arguing for a "Rewrite in C++." The arguments are deliberately constructed to be ironic mirrors of real-world debates:
    *   **Build Systems:** It praises the fragmentation of C++ build systems (CMake, Autotools, SCons) as "choice," while mocking Cargo's convenience as a "monoculture."
    *   **Safety:** The author dismisses memory safety bugs as "not that big of a deal" and claims to be a "good enough programmer" to avoid CVEs—a common rebuttal against Rust adoption, used here to absurd effect.
    *   **Community:** The author claims the C++ community (infamous in tech circles for being harsh and pedantic) will be "nicer and friendlier" than the Rust community, and specifically cites the "/r/cpp" subreddit's "sense of humor" (which is often sarcastic or cynical).
    *   **Politics:** The section on "politics" and "identity groups" mimics the specific complaints often levied by critics of the Rust community's moderation policies, but framed in a way that signals the author is engaging in a caricature of the "anti-woke" programmer.

2.  **The Year 2022 (Technical Clues):**
    *   **C++20 and C++26:** The text mentions C++20 modules as "innovative" and "looking forward to actually being implemented." C++20 was released in 2020, but support for modules was still very nascent in 2021/2022. The mention of looking forward to **C++26** places the text in a timeline where C++23 is the immediate next step, but C++26 is the horizon on the "3-year cycle" (C++20 -> C++23 -> C++26).
    *   **Carbon Language:** The text mentions the "new C++ compatible Carbon language." Carbon was publicly announced by Google in **July 2022**. For the text to mention it as an exciting prospect, it must be written around that time.
    *   **Herb Sutter's `cppfront`:** The text mentions Herb Sutter's proposal for a new syntax. Sutter started actively pushing and demonstrating `cppfront` (the C++ syntax evolution) around **2022**.
    *   **Linebender:** The "Linebender" organization is a real group that maintains Rust GUI tools (like `kurbo` and `peniko`). The fact that they are referenced grounds the satire in the specific timeline of the Rust GUI ecosystem's maturity, which was gaining significant traction in 2021-2022.

3.  **Conclusion:**
    The combination of the **April Fools' satire** (reversing the Rust vs. C++ zealotry) and the specific technological references (Carbon, C++26 anticipation, cppfront) points to **April 1, 2022**. This is the perfect window where Carbon was just about to or had just burst onto the scene, and the "Rust is slowing down" narrative was beginning to take hold as the language stabilized.
