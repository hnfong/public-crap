To make an informed guess about the date this passage was written, let's consider several key elements from the text:

1. **Rust and C++ Evolution**: The author mentions that Rust's pace of innovation has slowed down, noting that recent features like generic associated types and type alias impl trait are more about making existing features work rather than bringing new capabilities. This suggests a period after Rust 1.0 but before Rust 2.0, which was released in 2016. The author also mentions that C++ is evolving rapidly, with new features like modules and stackful coroutines being introduced. This aligns with the timeline of C++20 (2020) and C++23 (2023).

2. **C++20 and C++26**: The author specifically mentions C++20 and C++26, which were released in 2020 and 2023, respectively. This indicates that the writing is likely from a period after C++20 but before C++26.

3. **C++26 and Beyond**: The author mentions C++26 and talks about future features like stackful coroutines and new syntax. This suggests that the writing is from a period after C++26 but before C++26 is fully implemented.

4. **C++26 and C++28**: The author also mentions C++28, which is a future version of C++. This indicates that the writing is from a period after C++26 but before C++28 is released.

5. **C++28 and C++29**: The author mentions C++28 and C++29, which are future versions of C++. This suggests that the writing is from a period after C++28 but before C++29 is released.

Given these points, the passage seems to be written from a period after C++20 (2020) but before C++26 (2023) is fully implemented. The author also mentions C++26 and talks about future features, indicating a period after C++26 but before C++26 is fully implemented.

Considering the timeline and the specific mentions of C++20, C++26, and C++28, a reasonable guess for the date of this writing would be around 2023, just before C++26 is fully implemented. However, since C++26 was released in 2023, the writing is likely from a period just before C++26 was finalized and widely adopted.

Therefore, a reasonable guess for the date this passage was written is **2023**. [end of text]
