Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to guess the date this passage was written. First, I need to look for clues in the text. The author talks about Rust and C++, mentioning specific features and versions of both languages.

Starting with C++, the author mentions C++20 and C++26. C++20 was released in December 2020, and C++26 is expected around 2026. But the passage also references Herb Sutter's cppfront proposal and the Carbon language. Carbon was announced in 2021, so that might be a clue.

For Rust, the author mentions generic associated types and the "type alias impl trait" which were part of Rust 1.56 (released in 2021) and Rust 1.60 (2021), respectively. Async was stabilized in Rust 1.39 (2019), so that's a bit older.

The author also talks about the Rust community being imperious and the C++ community being nicer. Hacker News and Reddit discussions are mentioned, which are ongoing, but the specific mention of the C++ subreddit's humor might be a reference to a particular event or trend around that time.

Another clue is the mention of Linebender projects and the Zulip instance. If I can find any historical context about Linebender, that might help, but I don't recall any specific events related to that.

The author's frustration with Rust's build system (Cargo) and the desire to move to C++ suggests they might have been involved in a project that was still in progress. The mention of evaluating CMake and Meson for Linebender could indicate the timeline when these tools were popular.

Considering the dates, C++20 was a major release in 2020, and the author is excited about its features. The Carbon language was introduced in 2021, so the passage might have been written around late 2021 or early 2022. The Rust features mentioned align with 2021 releases, so that fits.

Also, the author references the C++ core guidelines and Stroustrup's safety paper, which are ongoing topics but might have been more prominent around the time of C++20's release.

Putting it all together, the most likely timeframe is late 2021 or early 2022. The mention of C++26 and Carbon suggests it's not too far in the future from 2021, so probably written in 2021 or 2022.

Based on the passage, here's my best guess for the date it was written, along with reasoning:

### **Estimated Date: Late 2021 or Early 2022**
---

### **Key Clues and Reasoning:**

1. **C++ Version Mentions:**
   - The author references **C++20** (released in December 2020) and **C++26** (expected around 2026). 
   - They also mention Herb Sutter's **cppfront** proposal (a hypothetical C++ frontend for a new language) and the **Carbon** project (announced in 2021). 
   - These references suggest the text was written **after C++20's release** (2020) but **before C++26's timeline** (mid-2020s). Carbon's announcement in 2021 further narrows it to **late 2021 or early 2022**.

2. **Rust Language Features:**
   - The author discusses **generic associated types** (stabilized in Rust 1.56, released in 2021) and the **"type alias impl trait"** (stabilized in Rust 1.60, 2021). 
   - Async was stabilized earlier (Rust 1.39, 2019), but the tone of the passage reflects a shift in Rust's innovation pace, aligning with post-2020 developments.

3. **Community and Tooling Context:**
   - The critique of the Rust community's "imperious" culture and the mention of the C++ subreddit's humor are timeless, but the specific reference to **Cargo's monoculture** and the evaluation of **CMake/Meson** for Linebender projects suggests the text was written during a period of active Rust adoption (post-2018) but growing frustration with its ecosystem.
   - The call to action for the **Zulip instance** and discussion on **Hacker News** and **Reddit** indicates it was written **after 2018**, when Rust's community grew significantly.

4. **Historical Context:**
   - The author's frustration with Rust's safety guarantees and desire to move to C++ aligns with a timeline when Rust was gaining mainstream traction (e.g., in 2020–2021, with projects like Firefox's Servo and Linebender's GUI toolkit). 
   - The mention of **C++'s safety roadmap** (Stroustrup's paper) and **modern C++ techniques** (e.g., string views, coroutines) reflects a period of C++ modernization post-C++17, which was active in 2020–2021.

---

### **Why Not Earlier or Later?**
- **Earlier (2019 or before):** The passage references C++20 and Carbon, which didn't exist yet. Rust's async stabilization was in 2019, but the tone of frustration with Cargo and Rust's ecosystem suggests a later timeline.
- **Later (2023 or beyond):** C++26 was not yet a major focus in 2023, and Carbon's momentum had waned by 2023. The Rust features mentioned (generic associated types) were already stabilized by 2021, so the text wouldn't reference them as "forthcoming."

---

### **Final Guess:**
The passage was likely written **in late 2021 or early 2022**, during a period of rapid C++ evolution (post-C++20) and growing Rust fatigue among some developers. [end of text]
