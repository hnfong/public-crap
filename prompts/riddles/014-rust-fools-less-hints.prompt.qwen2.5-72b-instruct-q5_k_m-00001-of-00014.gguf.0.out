Based on the content and context of the passage, it appears to have been written sometime in 2021 or 2022. Here are the key points that support this conclusion:

1. **Rust and C++ Ecosystems**: The passage discusses the current state of the Rust and C++ ecosystems, including the availability of build systems and language features. The mention of C++20 and the anticipation of C++26 (which would be the next major version after C++20) suggests a timeframe around 2021-2022, as C++20 was finalized in 2020 and C++26 is expected to be finalized around 2026.

2. **Language Features**: The passage mentions specific features of C++20, such as modules, and looks forward to features in C++26, such as stackful coroutines and a safe range-based for loop. This indicates that the author is writing during a period when C++20 is relatively new and C++26 is still in the planning stages.

3. **Rust Community and Development**: The author discusses the pace of innovation in Rust, noting that it has become more sedate. This suggests a time when Rust has matured and is focusing on stability and compatibility, which aligns with the state of Rust in 2021-2022.

4. **Community Dynamics**: The passage reflects on the community dynamics of both Rust and C++, mentioning the Rust community's reputation and the C++ community's perceived friendliness. These observations are consistent with the community dynamics observed in 2021-2022.

5. **References to Current Events**: The author mentions specific events and issues, such as CVEs and the use of Rust in Android, which are relevant to the recent past. The mention of the C++ subreddit and its sense of humor also suggests a contemporary context.

Given these points, the most likely date for this passage is sometime in 2021 or 2022. [end of text]
