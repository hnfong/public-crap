 Based on the content of the passage, it is likely that it was written in 2021 or 2022. Here are some clues that support this:

* The author mentions the upcoming C++20 and C++26 standards, which were finalized in 2020 and are expected to be released in 2023 and 2026, respectively.
* The author mentions the "new" C++ compatible Carbon language, which was announced in 2020.
* The author mentions the "excellent leadership" in the C++ community, which could be a reference to the ongoing efforts of the C++ standardization committee to modernize and improve the language.
* The author mentions the "rapid adoption of new features" in C++, which has been a focus of the C++ community in recent years.
* The author mentions the "new syntax" proposed by Herb Sutter, which was proposed in 2021.

On the other hand, there are no explicit references to current events or specific dates that would allow for a more precise estimation. Therefore, it is possible that the passage was written slightly earlier, but it is unlikely to be more than a year or two old. [end of text]
