The premise of your riddle is actually reversed: **Voidwalkers** are the common choice for leveling, not Succubi.

The reason is the Voidwalker's **Torment** ability, which generates high threat and tanks enemies effectively, keeping the fragile Warlock safe. While the Succubus deals more damage, her primary crowd-control skill, **Seduce**, breaks instantly upon any damage taken, making her unreliable for solo questing against multiple mobs.
