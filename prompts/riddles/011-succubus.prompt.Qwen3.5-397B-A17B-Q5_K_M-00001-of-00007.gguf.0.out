The premise of your riddle is actually reversed: **Voidwalkers** are the common choice for leveling because their **Torment** skill provides reliable threat generation (tankiness), allowing the Warlock to cast safely.

The **Succubus** is indeed often better for damage, but her signature crowd-control skill, **Seduce**, breaks instantly upon any damage taken. This makes her fragile and difficult to manage while questing in classic WoW, which is why players frequently stick with the safer Voidwalker despite the Succubus's higher DPS potential.
