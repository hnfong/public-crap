Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this riddle about why most Warlocks in Classic WoW are seen with Voidwalkers even though Succubi are better for leveling and questing. The hint says it's because of a Succubus skill that makes them more common than perceived. Hmm, I need to break this down.

First, I know that in Classic WoW, Warlocks have different demon pets they can summon. The two in question here are the Voidwalker and the Succubus. From what I remember, the Succubus is a caster-type pet with spells like Shadow Bolt, which is good for dealing damage from a distance. The Voidwalker, on the other hand, is a tankier pet with abilities like Torment and Consume Shadows, which are more for holding aggro and survival.

The riddle says that even though Succubi are better for leveling and questing, most Warlocks are seen with Voidwalkers. So why is that? The hint points to a skill of the Succubus that makes them more common than perceived. Wait, that seems a bit contradictory. If the Succubus is better, why are Voidwalkers more common?

Let me think about the skills each pet has. The Succubus has an ability called Seduction, which is a crowd control that charms enemies. Maybe that's the key. If Seduction is a skill that makes Succubi more useful in certain situations, perhaps it's actually a reason why they're preferred, but the riddle says the opposite. Or maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, maybe the Succubus's Seduction ability is the reason. If Warlocks use Seduction a lot, maybe it's because it's a valuable skill, but perhaps it's not always active. So when the Succubus is using Seduction, it's not dealing damage, which might make it seem less effective in some situations. Or maybe the Succubus is more commonly used in groups for the Seduction ability, but in solo play, the Voidwalker is better because it can tank.

But the riddle says that the Succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing, so maybe the reason Voidwalkers are more common is because of a Succubus skill that makes them less visible or something. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe it's because the Succubus has a skill that allows it to be used more often, making it seem like it's not as common. Or perhaps the skill in question is that the Succubus can be used in more situations, but the Voidwalker is more commonly seen because of some other factor.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. The answer is supposed to be concise, so maybe it's something straightforward. The Succubus has a skill that makes it more common, but the reason Voidwalkers are seen more is because of that skill. Maybe the Succubus's Seduction is the key. Because when a Succubus uses Seduction, it's controlling a mob, which might make it seem like the Warlock doesn't have a pet out, but in reality, the Succubus is just using that ability. So people might think they're not using the Succubus as much because they don't see it attacking, but it's actually being used for crowd control.

Wait, that makes sense. So when a Succubus is using Seduction, it's not visible as fighting, so people might think the Warlock is using a Voidwalker more often because they see the Voidwalker tanking, while the Succubus is busy controlling mobs. So the answer is that the Succubus's Seduction ability makes it seem like they're not as common, but they actually are because they're using that skill often.

So the answer is that the Succubus's Seduction ability is the reason. Because when they use it, the pet isn't visible as attacking, so people think they're not using Succubi as much, but in reality, they are. Therefore, the answer is that the Succubus's Seduction skill makes them more common than perceived, hence Voidwalkers are seen more often because the Succubus is busy using Seduction.

The answer is that the Succubus's Seduction ability is the reason. When a Succubus uses Seduction, it controls enemies, making it seem like the Warlock isn't using it as much. Thus, Voidwalkers are more commonly seen because the Succubus is often busy with crowd control. 

Answer: The Succubus's Seduction ability makes them seem less common, as they're often using it for crowd control, so Voidwalkers are more visible. [end of text]
