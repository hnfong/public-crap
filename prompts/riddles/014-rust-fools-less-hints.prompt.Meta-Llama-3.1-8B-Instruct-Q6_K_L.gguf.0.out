After carefully reading the passage, I'm going to take a stab at guessing the date it was written. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Mention of C++20 and C++26**: The passage mentions C++20 and C++26, which suggests that the author is referring to specific, upcoming versions of the C++ standard. C++20 was ratified in 2020, and C++26 is expected to be released in 2026. This suggests that the passage was written after 2020.
2. **Rust's pace of innovation**: The author mentions that Rust's pace of innovation has become "more sedate" compared to C++. This implies that the author is comparing Rust's current pace to its past pace, which was faster. This suggests that the author is writing from a perspective of having been involved with Rust for some time, which is consistent with the author having been involved in the Rust community for many years.
3. **Mention of the C++ core guidelines**: The author mentions the C++ core guidelines, which were first published in 2014. However, the author also mentions that they are "useful, even if they're honored in the breach," which suggests that the author is writing after the guidelines have been widely adopted and are no longer a new development.
4. **Mention of the Carbon language**: The author mentions the Carbon language, which is a proposed language that is compatible with C++. Carbon was first proposed in 2020, which suggests that the author is writing after that time.
5. **Tone and style**: The author's tone and style suggest a level of experience and confidence in their opinions, which is consistent with someone who has been involved in the Rust community for many years.

Taking all these factors into account, I'm going to guess that the passage was written in **2022**. This is based on the assumption that the author is writing after C++20 was ratified, but before C++26 is released, and after the Carbon language was proposed. [end of text]
