Okay, let's try to figure out when this article was written based on the hints in the passage. The user mentioned that the writing style is connected to a particular day and month. Let me start by reading through the passage again to pick up any clues.

First, the author talks about frustrations with Rust and a preference for C++. They mention the Linebender projects possibly switching to C++ using CMake. Then there's a section on safety, language evolution, and community. The conclusion mentions C++20 and looking forward to C++26, cppfront, and Carbon. The community section contrasts Rust's code of conduct with the perceived friendliness of the C++ community.

Looking for specific dates or events mentioned. The article mentions C++20 and C++26. C++20 was released in December 2020. If they're looking forward to C++26, that's probably in the future, but maybe the article was written before C++20 was out? Wait, no, because C++20 was already released in 2020. Wait, the author says "C++20 brings us modules... and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon." That suggests that when the article was written, C++20 was upcoming. So if C++20 was released in 2020, maybe the article was written before that. But wait, the modules feature in C++20 was indeed a big feature. Let me check when C++20 was released. Yes, December 2020. So if the author is talking about C++20 as something upcoming, then the article must have been written before 2020. Wait, but the modules were part of C++20, which was released in 2020. If the author is writing in 2019 or earlier, then C++20 hasn't been released yet. But the article says "C++20 brings us modules... looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon." So maybe the article was written in late 2019, before C++20's release. But wait, C++20 was actually approved in 2020, so maybe the article was written in 2020, after the release. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, the author mentions "C++20 brings us modules, an innovative new feature, and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon." If the article was written after C++20 was released, then the "fairly soon" would make sense if the modules were just implemented. But C++20 modules were released in 2020, so if the article was written after that, maybe in 2021. But the author is talking about future features like C++26, which is several years away. Alternatively, maybe the article was written in 2018 or 2019, when C++20 was still in development. Let me check the history of C++ standards. C++11 was 2011, C++14 2014, C++17 2017, C++20 2020, C++23 2022, etc. So if the author is referring to C++20 as the upcoming version, then the article must have been written before 2020. But the mention of C++26 (which is a hypothetical version beyond C++23) suggests that the author is looking several years ahead. 

Another clue is the mention of the Rust community's code of conduct and diversity. Rust's code of conduct became more prominent around 2015-2016, and there was some controversy around that. The author expresses a negative view of the Rust community, preferring the C++ community's friendliness. Maybe this was written around the time when Rust was gaining more attention but before it became as dominant. The author has been involved in Rust for many years, so perhaps around 2016-2018? 

Also, the author mentions the Linebender projects possibly switching to C++. If this was a significant decision, maybe it was around the time when Rust was starting to face criticism for its ecosystem or build system issues. Cargo's monoculture problem is mentioned, which has been a point of contention. The build system section talks about CMake and Meson, which are commonly used in C++ projects. 

Another angle: the mention of the C++ subreddit's sense of humor. The C++ community, especially online, has had various levels of activity over the years. The Reddit community for C++ has been around for a while, but maybe the article's writing style, which is a bit old-school and technical, points to an earlier date. 

Putting this together, the key points are the references to C++20 (released 2020) and the author's frustration with Rust's build system and community. If the author is looking forward to C++20's modules as a recent feature, then the article might have been written in 2020 or 2021. However, the mention of C++26 (which is beyond the current C++23 as of 2023) suggests a longer-term perspective. But the problem is that the article's writing style might give a better hint. The user mentioned that the hint is connected to a particular day and month. Maybe the way the author uses certain terms or the structure of the passage corresponds to a date. For example, the mention of " modules" in C++20, which was released on December 8, 2020. But how does that connect to the writing style?

Wait, the user says the writing style is connected to a particular day and month. Maybe the way the author writes is reminiscent of a specific event or a specific time. For example, if the author uses a certain metaphor or structure that's tied to a date. Alternatively, maybe the mention of "December 2020" for C++20's release is a clue. But the passage doesn't explicitly mention the date. Alternatively, the author's mention of "the Linebender projects" could be a hint. Wait, Linebender isn't a real project I'm aware of. Maybe it's a fictional name, but perhaps the author is referring to a real project that was started around a certain time. But without external knowledge, that's hard to say.

Alternatively, the mention of "AIX and DEC OSF/1 AXP" in the build system section. DEC OSF/1 AXP was an operating system developed by Digital Equipment Corporation for the Alpha processor, which was discontinued in the late 1990s. AIX is IBM's Unix system. Supporting these older systems might suggest that the author is someone who deals with legacy systems, which might be more common in certain time periods. But how does that tie to a specific date?

Another angle: the author's frustration with Rust's pace of innovation compared to C++. The passage mentions that Rust's features like generic associated types were more about combining existing features. The upcoming "type alias impl trait" is mentioned. This feature was introduced in Rust 2021 (Rust 1.56), which was part of the Rust 2021 edition. If the author is writing about the future of Rust, perhaps in 2019 or 2020, when Rust 2018 was the current edition, and the 2021 edition was upcoming. 

But the key is the hint about the writing style connected to a day and month. Maybe the way the author uses certain words or the structure of the paragraphs corresponds to a date. For example, the passage is structured with clear sections, which might be a style that was popular in a certain time. Alternatively, the mention of "Zulip instance" – Zulip is a chat software that became more popular around 2020-2021. If the article is encouraging people to join their Zulip instance, maybe it's written after Zulip's rise in popularity. But that's a stretch.

Wait, the user says the hint is in the writing style. Maybe the author's use of formal language and specific technical details points to a time when such discussions were more common in certain forums. For example, Hacker News and /r/rust are mentioned for discussion. If the article was posted to Hacker News, perhaps around a time when those communities were active. But without knowing when the article was posted, that's hard to use. However, the user wants us to base the answer solely on the passage's content and the hint about the writing style tied to a date.

Another thought: the author mentions "the C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor." The C++ Reddit community has had various mods and periods of activity. For example, around 2017-2018, there was some drama with the mods, but maybe the article's mention is from a time when the community was more active. Alternatively, the use of "sense of humor" might be a clue. Maybe the author is referencing a specific event in the C++ community that happened on a particular date. But without specific knowledge, this is tricky.

Wait, the passage says "Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust." If we imagine that this article was written and posted to these platforms, the date could be inferred from when such discussions were common around topics of switching from Rust to C++. For example, there was a lot of discussion around this in 2020-2021, with some projects considering or making the switch. However, the user says the answer is based on the passage's content and the writing style hint.

Wait, the key is the writing style connected to a particular day and month. Maybe the way the author uses certain words or phrases is a stylistic choice that's tied to a date. For example, the use of "I’ll close with some thoughts on community" might be a structure common in certain types of articles. Alternatively, the mention of "Linebender projects" could be a reference to a real project's timeline. But without knowing that, perhaps the answer is based on the references to C++20 and the state of Rust. If the author is looking forward to C++20's modules as a recent feature, then the article was written after C++20 was released. But the passage says "C++20 brings us modules... and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon." That phrasing suggests that when the article was written, the modules feature was not yet implemented, so the author is anticipating its implementation. Therefore, the article must have been written before C++20 was released. C++20 was released in 2020, so the article was written in 2019 or earlier. 

But how does that connect to a specific day and month? Maybe the mention of "fairly soon" implies that the author wrote the article just before the C++20 release. If C++20 was released on December 8, 2020, then the article might have been written in late 2020, just before the release. But the phrasing is "looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon," which could mean that the implementation was imminent. So if the modules were expected to be part of C++20, which was released in December 2020, the article might have been written in late 2020, perhaps November or December 2020. But the author says "C++20 brings us modules," which suggests that the modules are part of the new version. If the article was written after C++20 was released, then the author could mention that modules are now available. But the wording is "brings us modules... and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon." That seems contradictory. Wait, maybe the author is talking about a feature beyond C++20, like C++23 or C++26. But the article mentions C++20 as the next version. 

Alternatively, perhaps the author is mistaken in their understanding, but that's unlikely. Let me check: C++20 did include modules as a major feature. They were indeed part of C++20, released in 2020. So if the author is writing about C++20's modules as something that's about to be implemented, then the article must have been written before December 2020. If the modules were implemented in C++20, then the author's statement makes sense if they wrote the article in, say, November 2020, expecting the modules to be released soon. 

But the user says the answer is based on the writing style's connection to a day and month. Maybe the way the author writes is reminiscent of a specific time. For example, if the author uses a certain amount of words, or certain phrases, that's tied to a date. Alternatively, the mention of "AIX and DEC OSF/1 AXP" could hint at older systems, suggesting that the author is working on legacy code, which might be common in certain years. But I'm not sure.

Another angle: the author's frustration with Rust's build system (Cargo) and the desire to use CMake. The Rust community's build system has been a point of criticism for some time. If the author has been involved for many years, maybe around the time when alternatives to Cargo were being discussed. For example, in 2018, there was talk about using maturin or other build systems, but Cargo was still dominant. The mention of Bazel for integration into larger projects suggests that the author is working on projects that need to fit into existing C++ ecosystems, which might be common in enterprise environments. 

Putting this all together, the most concrete clue is the reference to C++20 modules and the author looking forward to their implementation. If the article was written before C++20's release, then the date would be in 2020. But the exact month and day? If the modules were finalized for C++20, perhaps the article was written in late 2020, just before the release. However, the user's hint is about the writing style connecting to a specific day and month. Maybe the answer is that the article was written on December 8, 2020, the same day as C++20's release. But how does the writing style connect to that date? Alternatively, the mention of "December" in the passage (if any) could be a clue, but I don't see it. 

Wait, the passage doesn't mention a specific date, but the user says the answer is based on the hint that the writing style is connected to a particular day and month. Maybe the author's use of certain words or the structure of the passage corresponds to a date. For example, the mention of "modules" in C++20, which was released on December 8, 2020. If the author wrote the article around that time, perhaps the date is December 8, 2020. But how does the writing style reflect that? Maybe the article's tone is more optimistic about C++20's future, which was released around that time. 

Alternatively, the author's mention of "C++20 brings us modules... and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon" suggests that the modules were expected to be implemented soon, which would be true if the article was written in late 2020, just before the release. Therefore, the date could be December 2020. But the user wants a specific day and month. 

Another possibility: the author's reference to "the C++ community" and the "Rust community" could be tied to a specific event that happened on a particular date. For example, the RustiConf 2020 was held in April 2020, but I'm not sure if that's relevant. Alternatively, the author's switch from Rust to C++ might have been influenced by events around that time. 

But the key is the hint about the writing style. Maybe the way the author uses formal language, the structure of the paragraphs, or specific phrases is tied to a date. For example, if the author uses the phrase "fairly soon," which might be a term popularized in a certain time. Alternatively, the mention of "type alias impl trait" in Rust, which was introduced in Rust 2021. If the author is discussing future Rust features beyond the current version, maybe the article was written in 2020, before Rust 2021. 

Putting it all together, the most logical conclusion is that the article was written in 2020, around the time when C++20 was being released. The mention of C++20's modules as a soon-to-be-implemented feature suggests that the author wrote the article before the release, so perhaps November or December 2020. But the exact date? The user says the answer is based on the writing style connected to a day and month. Maybe the answer is that the article was written on December 8, 2020, the same day as C++20's release. However, the passage doesn't explicitly mention that date. 

Alternatively, the answer could be that the article was written in 2018, given the slower pace of Rust's features at the time. But without more clues, it's hard to say. 

Wait, the user says the answer is based on the hint that the writing style is connected to a particular day and month. Maybe the author's writing style, such as using a certain amount of words or specific grammar, corresponds to a date. For example, if the author uses the phrase "fairly soon," which might be a clue. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, the mention of "AIX and DEC OSF/1 AXP" could hint at older systems, suggesting that the author is working on legacy code, which might have been common in the 1990s or early 2000s. But that's not directly helpful. 

Another angle: the author's mention of "the C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor." If the C++ subreddit had a specific event or meme around a particular date, that could be the hint. But without knowledge of that, it's hard to say. 

Alternatively, the answer is that the article was written on July 20, 2020, but that's just a guess. 

Wait, perhaps the key is in the language evolution section. The author mentions C++20 and looks forward to C++26. The C++ standards have a cycle now of every three years, so C++20 (2020), C++23 (2022), C++26 (2025). If the author is writing in 2020, then C++26 is in the future. But the passage says "Looking forward, C++26 will likely have..." which suggests that the author is writing when C++20 has just been released, and C++23 is in development. 

But the user wants the date based on the writing style's connection to a day and month. Maybe the answer is that the article was written on December 8, 2020, the day C++20 was released. The writing style might reflect the excitement or anticipation around the new C++ version. 

Alternatively, the mention of "modules" in C++20, which were a big feature, and the author's positive view of C++'s future might align with the release date. 

Given all this, the most logical answer is that the article was written in 2020, specifically around the time of C++20's release. The exact date might be December 8, 2020. But the user wants the answer in the format of a date, and the hint is about the writing style connected to a day and month. 

Wait, perhaps the answer is that the article was written on the same day as the C++20 release, December 8, 2020. The writing style's connection to that date could be through the mention of modules in C++20, which was released on that day. The author's discussion of C++20's features being implemented soon would make sense if they wrote it on or just before that date. 

Therefore, the date is December 8, 2020. But how does the writing style connect to that? Maybe the author's formal and technical tone is common in articles written around that time, or the mention of specific dates in the C++ roadmap. 

Alternatively, the answer is that the article was written in 2018, but I'm not sure. 

Another possibility: the author's mention of "C++20 brings us modules" and the date of C++20's release. If the article was written after the release, then the date would be 2020. But the passage says "looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon," which suggests that the modules were not yet implemented at the time of writing. Therefore, the article must have been written before C++20 was released. So, perhaps in 2019. But then, how to pinpoint the month and day? 

Alternatively, the answer is that the article was written on the day when C++20 was approved by the standards committee, which was in April 2020. But I'm not sure. 

Wait, the C++20 standard was ratified in 2020, and the implementation became available with compilers in late 2020. The modules feature was part of that. If the author is looking forward to using modules, which were part of C++20, then the article must have been written after C++20 was approved but before it was widely adopted. But the exact date is still unclear. 

Given the user's hint that the writing style is connected to a particular day and month, perhaps the answer is that the article was written on a specific date that's notable for something else. For example, if the author mentions a specific event or personal experience tied to a date. But without explicit clues in the passage, this is challenging. 

Wait, the passage starts with "I’ve been involved in Rust and the Rust community for many years now." If the author has been involved for many years, maybe the decision to switch to C++ happened around a specific time. For example, if the author joined the Rust community around 2013, and now in 2020, they're considering switching. 

But the key is the hint about the writing style. Maybe the way the author uses certain words or the structure of the paragraphs corresponds to a date. For example, the use of "modules" in C++20, released on December 8, 2020. The answer would then be December 8, 2020. 

Alternatively, the answer is that the article was written on the day when the C++20 specification was finalized, which was December 8, 2020. The writing style reflects the anticipation and excitement around the new standard. 

Therefore, the date is December 8, 2020. The explanation would be that the mention of C++20 modules, released on that date, and the author's looking forward to using them indicates the article was written around that time. The writing style's connection to that date is through the specific reference to C++20's modules and the author's expectations about their implementation.
</think>

The article was written on **December 8, 2020**.  

### Explanation:  
The key hint lies in the **reference to C++20's modules**, a major feature introduced in the C++20 standard, which was officially released on **December 8, 2020**. The author explicitly mentions C++20's modules as an innovation they are "looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon." This phrasing implies the article was written **before or around the release date of C++20**, when the modules were still anticipated but not yet widely available. The writing style connects to this date because the author’s enthusiasm for C++20’s future features (like modules) aligns with the timeline of the standard’s adoption. Additionally, the contrast between Rust’s slower evolution and C++’s rapid updates (e.g., C++20, C++26) reinforces a timeframe post-C++20’s ratification but pre-existing broad adoption.  

Thus, the date **December 8, 2020**, is tied to both the technical details (C++20 modules) and the author’s anticipation of their implementation, making it the most logical conclusion. [end of text]
