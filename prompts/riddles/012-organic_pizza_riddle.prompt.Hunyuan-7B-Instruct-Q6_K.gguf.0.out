In this scenario, Bob is sharing that he ate a healthy meal consisting of aged organic milk and seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat. However, the term "wtf" (which stands for "what the fuck") suggests that Alice found the meal unusual or unexpected, possibly because she didn't expect aged milk to be part of a healthy, balanced meal. 

The meal itself appears to be healthy because it includes organic ingredients, whole grains, and a tomato-based sauce, which are generally considered nutritious. However, the combination of aged milk and tomato purée might not align with traditional or popular perceptions of a healthy meal, leading to Alice's reaction.
