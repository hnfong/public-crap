It seems like Bob sent Alice a photo of something that Alice didn't expect, and her reaction is one of surprise and possibly even disgust. 

Based on the conversation, it appears that Bob claimed to have eaten "aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato pur√©e spread on baked whole wheat." However, the photo he sent Alice suggests that he actually ate something entirely different, which is why she reacted with "wtf" (an expression of confusion and possibly even shock).

Without seeing the photo, it's impossible to know for certain what Bob ate, but it's likely that it was something unexpected and possibly not as healthy as he claimed. [end of text]
