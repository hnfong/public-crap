Based on the passage, the most plausible date of writing is **mid-2023 to early 2024**.

Here’s a detailed, thoughtful breakdown of the reasoning — including both direct evidence and subtle contextual clues that go beyond surface-level facts:

---

### 🔍 1. **C++20 and C++26 Mentions**
The author explicitly references:
- **C++20** (modules, which were officially released in 2020)
- **C++26** (stackful coroutines, embedded binary initialization, safe range-based for loops)

> "Looking forward, C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies."

This is **not** a statement about what *will* happen in C++26 — it's a *prediction* of features that are *planned or expected* in the near future.

- C++26 was **not finalized until 2023**, and its feature set was still being discussed and shaped.
- The **first draft of the C++26 standard** was published in **late 2022**, with finalization expected in **2023–2024**.
- The mention of "stackful coroutines" and "embedding binary data" as *likely* features in C++26 is **very specific** and aligns with the timeline of the C++26 working group’s proposals (e.g., P2983R0, P2984R0, etc.).

👉 This suggests the author is writing **after** the C++26 draft was publicly available and being discussed in the community — likely **after late 2022**, and **before the final standard was adopted**.

---

### 🔍 2. **Rust’s "Sedate" Innovation Pace**
The author contrasts Rust’s recent feature development with C++’s rapid evolution.

> "The pace of innovation in Rust has become more sedate... generic associated types have more of the flavor of making combinations of existing features work as expected rather than bringing any fundamentally new capabilities..."

This is a **very specific observation** about Rust’s feature set post-2018.

- Rust’s **edition system** (which prevents breaking changes) was introduced in 2018.
- The **"type alias impl trait"** feature (a.k.a. `impl Trait` with type aliases) was **introduced in Rust 1.70 (2023)**.
- The **generic associated types (GATs)** were introduced in **Rust 1.40 (2019)**, and have been used in various forms since.

But the author says:
> "the forthcoming 'type alias impl trait' is similar" — implying it's *not yet released*.

👉 This suggests the author is writing **after 2023**, because:
- The feature was **not yet stable** in 2022 or early 2023.
- It was **officially stabilized in Rust 1.70 (September 2023)**.

So the passage must have been written **after September 2023**, when the feature was available.

---

### 🔍 3. **"C++26" as a Forward-Looking Term**
The author says:
> "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop..."

This is **not** a statement about what C++26 *actually* has — it's a *prediction* based on current development.

- The **C++26 standard** was **not finalized** until **2023–2024**.
- The **first public draft** of C++26 was released in **June 2022**.
- The **final standard** was **approved in 2023**, with implementation expected in **2024**.

So the author is writing **after the draft was public**, and **before the final standard was adopted** — likely **mid-2023 to early 2024**.

---

### 🔍 4. **"cppfront" and "Carbon"**
The author mentions:
> "C++ has even more exciting changes to look forward to, including potentially a new syntax as proposed by Herb Sutter cppfront, and even the new C++ compatible Carbon language."

- **cppfront** is a **proposed syntax extension** by Herb Sutter, introduced in **2021–2022**.
- It was discussed in **2022** and **2023**, and is still a **conceptual proposal**, not implemented.
- **Carbon** is a **new language** being developed by Microsoft (as a C++-compatible language), announced in **2023**.

👉 The mention of both **cppfront** and **Carbon** as *potential* future features suggests the author is writing **after 2023**, when these were gaining visibility.

---

### 🔍 5. **Rust Community "Imperious" Criticism**
The author says:
> "I hear that the Rust community can be extremely imperious, constantly demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust, and denigrating all other programming languages."

This is a **well-known critique** that gained traction in **2022–2023**, especially after:
- The **Rust "no-std" push** and **"Rust is the only safe language"** rhetoric.
- The **"Rust is not for everyone"** debates.
- The **"Rust is not a language for beginners"** sentiment.

This criticism became more prominent in **2022–2023**, especially in discussions on Hacker News and Reddit.

👉 So the author is likely writing **after 2022**, when this critique was widely circulated.

---

### 🔍 6. **Call to Action: "Join our Zulip instance"**
The author says:
> "We’re looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite. If you’re interested, please join our Zulip instance."

This is a **very specific call to action** — suggesting the project is **active and in development**.

- Zulip instances are often used for **active open-source projects**.
- The **Linebender project** (a GUI toolkit) is not widely known, but it's plausible it was being developed in **2023–2024**.
- The **timing of such a public announcement** (especially with a call to join a Zulip instance) suggests it was written **after the project had already begun the C++ transition**.

---

### 🔍 7. **No Mention of Rust 1.72 or Later**
The author doesn’t reference:
- Rust 1.72 (2023)
- Rust 1.73 (2023)
- Rust 1.74 (2024)

But they do mention **"the forthcoming 'type alias impl trait'"**, which was **introduced in 1.70 (2023)**.

So the passage must be written **after 2023**.

---

### ✅ Final Synthesis

| Clue | Implies |
|------|--------|
| C++26 features (stackful coroutines, embedded binary data) | Drafts published 2022–2023; finalization in 2023–2024 |
| "Type alias impl trait" is "forthcoming" | Stabilized in Rust 1.70 (Sept 2023) |
| cppfront and Carbon mentioned as "potential" | Gained traction in 2023 |
| Criticism of Rust community | Peaked in 2022–2023 |
| Call to join Zulip | Suggests active project in 2023–2024 |

---

### 📅 Best Guess: **Mid-2023 to Early 2024**

More precisely:  
👉 **September 2023 to January 2024**

This is when:
- C++26 was being actively discussed
- Rust 1.70 (with `impl Trait` type aliases) was stable
- The Rust community’s "imperious" reputation was at its peak
- Open-source projects like Linebender were actively considering C++ rewrites

---

### 🚨 Bonus Thought: Why Not Earlier?

- In **2021–2022**, C++20 was the focus, not C++26.
- Rust’s feature development was still rapid (e.g., async, `async/await`, `const generics`).
- The "imperious" critique of Rust was not as widespread or public.
- The mention of **Carbon** and **cppfront** as *potential* features would not have been common in 2021 or 2022.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
> **September 2023 to January 2024**

This is the most well-supported, contextually grounded, and logically consistent date range based on the technical, linguistic, and community-aware content of the passage. [end of text]
