Looking at this passage, I need to analyze several key clues to determine when it was written:

**Key Timeline Indicators:**

1. **C++20 and C++26 references**: The author mentions C++20 (which was finalized in 2020) and looks forward to C++26 (which would be around 2026-2027). This suggests the writing occurred around 2023-2024.

2. **"Rust was a good experiment"**: This phrasing suggests the author is reflecting on Rust's early days, which would be around 2015-2020 when Rust was gaining traction.

3. **Specific C++ features mentioned**: 
   - C++20 modules (finalized 2020)
   - C++26 stackful coroutines (planned for 2026)
   - cppfront (Herb Sutter's experimental C++ syntax, developed around 2020-2023)
   - Carbon language (announced in 2021)

4. **Community references**: The author mentions Rust's "code of conduct and other policies promoting diversity" and describes Rust community behavior, suggesting this was written during the height of Rust's community debates around inclusivity policies.

5. **Linebender projects**: The author mentions these projects, which were active in the Rust ecosystem around 2020-2023.

6. **"We're looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite"**: This suggests the transition was planned but not yet complete, indicating a recent decision.

**Most telling clue**: The author mentions C++26 will likely have "stackful coroutines" and other features, and references cppfront and Carbon language. The Carbon language was announced in 2021, and the author's timeline suggests they're writing about the future of C++ while still in the process of transitioning from Rust.

**Best guess: Late 2023 to early 2024**

The passage was likely written in **late 2023 or early 2024**. This timing aligns with:
- The author's awareness of C++20 features
- The anticipation of C++26 features (which would be 2026-2027)
- The Carbon language announcement in 2021
- The cppfront experimental syntax development
- The Rust community's ongoing evolution during this period

The specific date would likely be **December 2023** or **January 2024**. [end of text]
