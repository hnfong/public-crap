To estimate the date when this passage was written, we can analyze several key points mentioned in the text:

1. **C++20 Features**: The passage mentions C++20 and its features, such as modules. C++20 was officially released in December 2020. This suggests the passage was written after this date.

2. **C++26 and Future Features**: The passage references C++26 and potential features like stackful coroutines and a new syntax proposed by Herb Sutter (cppfront). As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, C++26 is still in the proposal stage, with no official release date set. This indicates the passage was written when these features were still speculative or in early discussion stages.

3. **Rust Editions and Features**: The passage discusses Rust's slower pace of innovation due to its commitment to backward compatibility, contrasting it with C++. This reflects a period when Rust's development had stabilized somewhat after the introduction of editions, which began with Rust 2018.

4. **Community Dynamics**: The author's critique of the Rust community's attitude and the mention of the C++ subreddit's sense of humor suggest a period when these community dynamics were notable topics of discussion.

5. **Linebender Projects**: The passage mentions the Linebender projects, which are real projects focused on GUI toolkits in Rust. The author's decision to move to C++ indicates a significant shift, likely discussed in community forums around the time of the announcement.

Considering these points, the passage likely dates from late 2021 to early 2023. This timeframe aligns with the release of C++20, ongoing discussions about future C++ standards, and the author's evolving perspective on Rust and C++. The mention of specific community dynamics and the decision to transition projects suggest a period when these topics were actively debated, likely around 2022 or early 2023. [end of text]
