It seems like Bob's attempt at a healthy breakfast didn't quite go as planned.

From the conversation, we can infer that Bob ate:

* Aged organic milk (a healthy choice)
* Tomato purée (a relatively healthy condiment)
* Baked whole wheat (a healthy grain)

However, the phrase "tossed over" suggests that Bob might have added a significant amount of oil or fat to his dish, which would make it less healthy. The fact that Alice responded with "wtf" implies that Bob's dish might be a bit...unusual.

Given the context, it's possible that Bob added a large amount of oil or a rich sauce to his dish, which would make it less healthy. Perhaps he added a lot of cheese or a creamy sauce to the tomato purée, which would increase the calorie and fat content of his breakfast.

So, while Bob's ingredients are generally healthy, the way he prepared them might not be the healthiest choice. [end of text]
