The passage was written on **April 1st**. 

### Explanation:
The key clue lies in the **distinctive writing style** hinted at in the question, which is tied to a specific **day and month**. The passage itself contains a subtle, almost humorous reference to this date. While the text does not explicitly mention "April 1st," the **tone and content** of the article align with the **April Fools' Day** tradition. Here's how the hint is used:

1. **Humor and Satire**: The author critiques Rust's "imperious" community and its "code of conduct," which mirrors the playful, satirical tone of April Fools' Day. The passage also mocks Rust's "safety guarantees" and "language evolution," which could be interpreted as a joke about the language's overhyped features.

2. **C++'s "Exciting" Future**: The author mentions C++'s upcoming features (e.g., "stackful coroutines," "cppfront," and "Carbon") with a tone of exaggerated optimism, which feels like a parody of tech hype cycles often associated with April Fools' Day.

3. **Date as a Joke**: The passage ends with a call to action for collaboration, which could be a nod to the "April Fools' Day" tradition of playful, collaborative projects. The author's frustration with Rust and preference for C++ might also reflect the "prank" of switching to a more "mature" language.

4. **C++ Community's Humor**: The author notes that the C++ subreddit is "well known for their sense of humor," which aligns with the lighthearted, irreverent tone of April Fools' Day.

While the passage does not explicitly state the date, the **style and content** strongly suggest it was written on **April 1st**, leveraging the humor and satire of April Fools' Day to critique Rust and promote C++. This makes the date a clever, hidden clue tied to the article's distinctive writing style. [end of text]
