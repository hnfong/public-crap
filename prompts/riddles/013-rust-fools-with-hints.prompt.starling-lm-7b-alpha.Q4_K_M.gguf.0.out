To determine the date this passage was written, we can analyze the writing style and look for any clues or references that might indicate a specific day or month. The passage discusses the author's experience with Rust and their decision to switch to C++ for their Linebender projects. It also mentions the evolution of the C++ language and the author's preference for the C++ community.

One clue that might help us identify the date is the mention of the C++ subreddit's sense of humor. While this doesn't provide a specific date, it does suggest that the passage was written by someone familiar with the C++ community and its culture. This could potentially narrow down the pool of potential authors and help us identify the date more accurately.

However, without any specific references to a particular day or month, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact date this passage was written. The writing style, while distinctive, is not unique enough to identify a specific day or month. Therefore, it's not possible to determine the exact date this passage was written based on the information provided.

In conclusion, while the passage provides some interesting insights into the author's experience with Rust and C++, it doesn't offer enough specific information to determine the exact date it was written.
