Let's break down what Bob said and what likely happened:

### What did Bob say he ate?
Bob said:
> "Today I ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat."

Let's parse this sentence:

- **Aged organic milk**: This is milk that has been aged (perhaps like aged cheese, but milk isn't typically aged; maybe he meant aged cheese, but he said milk), and it's organic.
- **Tossed over**: This is a phrase usually used for salads, meaning something is placed on top.
- **Seasoned tomato purée**: Tomato purée with some seasonings.
- **Spread on baked whole wheat**: So, the tomato purée is spread on baked whole wheat (probably bread or a cracker), and then the milk is tossed over it.

So, the meal Bob describes sounds like:
- He took some **baked whole wheat bread** (or perhaps a cracker),
- Spread **seasoned tomato purée** on it,
- Then "tossed" **aged organic milk** over it.

But **milk isn't typically "tossed" over food like a salad ingredient**. You don't pour milk over tomato on bread and expect it to stay; it would likely make the bread soggy and the milk would mix with the tomato.

### What did Bob actually eat?
Given the description and the reaction ("wtf" from Alice after seeing the photo), it's likely that Bob's meal looked odd or unappetizing. The way he described it sounds like a jumble of ingredients that don't go well together, or perhaps he made a weird food presentation.

Possibly, the "aged organic milk" was meant to be a cheese (since milk isn't usually aged), but even if it was cheese, tossing milk or cheese over tomato purée on bread is not a typical or appetizing combination for most people.

Alternatively, maybe Bob actually poured milk over the tomato and bread, resulting in a soggy, unappetizing mess.

### Was it healthy?
Let's analyze the healthiness of the components:

- **Whole wheat bread**: Healthy, provides fiber and nutrients.
- **Tomato purée**: Tomatoes are healthy, but purée loses some nutrients and can be high in sodium if seasoned.
- **Aged organic milk (or possibly cheese)**: Milk and cheese are healthy in moderation, but if it's actual milk poured over, it's not a typical use and may not add much nutrition in that context.

However, the *way* it was prepared likely made it less healthy (e.g., soggy bread, not a balanced meal), and the combination is not standard or appealing.

### What happened?
- Bob tried to make a healthy meal using wholesome ingredients.
- He described it in a confusing or unusual way ("tossed aged organic milk over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat").
- When Alice saw the photo, she was confused or disgusted by the appearance or the odd combination, hence "wtf".

### Conclusion
**Bob ate a dish that consisted of tomato purée on baked whole wheat, with milk poured over it.** The combination is unusual and unappetizing to most people, and the way it was described and presented likely led to Alice's confused reaction. While the individual ingredients are healthy, the preparation and combination make the meal unappealing and perhaps not as healthy as it could have been if prepared differently.

**In short:**  
Bob made an odd, unappetizing meal by putting tomato purée on whole wheat bread and pouring milk over it. It was probably not very tasty, and the way it was prepared made it seem unhealthy or at least unappetizing, hence Alice's reaction. [end of text]
