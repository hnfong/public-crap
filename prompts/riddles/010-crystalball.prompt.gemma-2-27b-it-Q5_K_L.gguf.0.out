The clerk likely said this because crystal balls are often associated with fortune-telling and the supernatural. 

Covering it could be a superstitious practice to:

* **Prevent negative energy:** Some believe uncovered crystal balls can attract unwanted spirits or negative energy.
* **Protect the ball's power:**  Others might believe covering it preserves its mystical properties. 


Essentially, the clerk's warning is rooted in folklore and superstition surrounding crystal balls.
