The passage was most likely written on **April 1st** — **April Fools' Day**.

### How the hint leads to this conclusion:

The key clue is in the instruction: *"The hint is the distinctive writing style of the article which is connected to one particular day and month of the year."* This strongly suggests that the **tone or style** of the article is characteristic of a specific date — and in internet and tech culture, the most notable day for deceptive, satirical, or ironic writing is **April 1st**, **April Fools' Day**.

Let’s analyze how the content and style align with an April Fools’ parody:

---

### 1. **Plausible on the surface, but increasingly absurd**
The article starts with a tone of serious technical reflection — someone leaving Rust for C++, citing build systems, safety, language evolution, and community. It uses real technical details (CMake, Meson, C++20 modules, cppfront, Carbon, Zulip, etc.) that make it sound credible to a Rust/C++ developer.

But as it progresses, **red flags emerge**:

- The claim that **memory safety bugs are "not fundamentally different" than logic errors** — especially from someone who worked on **font parsing in Android** (a historically vulnerable area) — is **wildly dismissive** of decades of security research. This is a major red flag for a serious technical argument.
  
- Saying **"I’m good enough to avoid safety bugs"** is a classic trope of **overconfident, anti-safety-culture rhetoric** — common in satire.

- The assertion that **C++ is safer now** and that **its language evolution is faster and better than Rust’s** — while technically containing grains of truth — is presented with **selective enthusiasm** (e.g., praising C++26 features that were speculative at best) and **downplays C++’s well-known complexity and pitfalls**.

- The claim that **"the C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor"** is **itself ironic**, as r/cpp is generally quite dry and technical — unlike r/ProgrammerHumor or other meme-friendly subs. This is a **wink to the reader**.

### 2. **Satirical jabs at both communities**
The article mocks **both** Rust and C++ communities in ways typical of April Fools’ humor:

- **Rust community**: Portrayed as **zealous, dogmatic, politically correct**, and obsessed with rewriting everything in Rust — a common caricature used in satire.
  
- **C++ community**: Portrayed as **mature, stable, and friendly**, with "excellent leadership" and a great sense of humor — which is **an overly rosy, almost naive view** of a community known for complexity, legacy baggage, and sometimes elitism.

This **balanced mockery** — praising one side while ridiculing the other, but in exaggerated ways — is classic April Fools’ style.

### 3. **The politics section is a dead giveaway**
> *"I firmly believe that programming languages should be free of politics... I understand how some identity groups may desire more representation, but I feel it is not necessary."*

This is **deliberately tone-deaf** and **contradicts widely accepted values** in modern open-source communities. It’s phrased in a way that sounds like a **strawman argument** — the kind of thing a parody would include to mock anti-diversity sentiments **by mimicking them so closely they become absurd**.

It’s unlikely a serious author would include this in a genuine announcement — but **perfectly in line with satire** that critiques both sides: the **Rust community’s CoC enforcement** and the **C++ community’s historical lack of inclusivity efforts**.
