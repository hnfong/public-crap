Okay, so I need to figure out when this passage was written. The user mentioned that the hint is the distinctive writing style connected to a particular day and month. Hmm, that's a bit vague, but maybe it's referring to April Fool's Day, which is on April 1st. Let me think about why that might be the case.

Looking at the passage, the author is moving from Rust to C++ for their project, which is a significant shift. They discuss build systems, safety, language evolution, and community aspects. The tone seems a bit critical of Rust and optimistic about C++. But why would that relate to April 1st?

Well, sometimes people write satirical or humorous pieces on April Fool's Day, pretending to switch languages or make controversial statements. The author's points about the Rust community being "imperious" and the C++ community being nicer with a sense of humor might be exaggerated for effect. Also, the mention of looking forward to C++ features and the leadership, especially Stroustrup's paper, could be part of a tongue-in-cheek argument.

Another clue is the mention of discussing on Hacker News and /r/rust, which are platforms where such debates are common, and April Fool's Day often brings out joke posts. The overall tone doesn't seem overly serious, which fits with an April Fool's prank.

So, putting it all together, the writing style and content seem to align with an April Fool's Day post, where someone might jokingly announce a switch from Rust to C++ as a prank. Therefore, I think the passage was written on April 1st.

The passage was likely written on **April 1st**. The hint suggests the writing style is connected to a specific day and month, pointing to April Fool's Day. The tone and content, which humorously critique Rust and praise C++, align with the playful nature of April 1st. The exaggerated arguments and community comparisons fit the satirical style typical of April Fool's pranks, making this the probable date. 

**Answer:** April 1st. [end of text]
