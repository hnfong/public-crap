It sounds like Bob's description of his meal is a bit convoluted and possibly misleading. Let's break down what he said:

- **Aged organic milk**: This likely refers to yogurt or cheese, but the term "aged" can be ambiguous.
- **Tossed over seasoned tomato purée**: This suggests a sauce or dressing made from tomatoes.
- **Spread on baked whole wheat**: This indicates that the tomato purée was spread on a whole wheat base, possibly bread or a similar baked good.

Given the context and the reaction from Alice, it seems that Bob's description might be a playful or exaggerated way of describing a dish that is actually quite simple. The photo he sent likely revealed something that was not as appetizing or healthy as it sounded.

### What Bob Probably Ate:
- **Whole wheat toast** (the baked whole wheat base)
- **Tomato sauce or purée** (the seasoned tomato purée spread on top)
- **Feta cheese or yogurt** (the aged organic milk tossed over the tomato purée)

### Was It Healthy?
- **Whole wheat toast**: Generally healthy, as it provides fiber and complex carbohydrates.
- **Tomato purée**: Healthy, as tomatoes are rich in vitamins and antioxidants.
- **Feta cheese or yogurt**: Can be healthy in moderation, especially if it's organic and aged, as it provides protein and probiotics.

However, the combination and presentation might have been unusual or unappealing, leading to Alice's reaction of "wtf." It's possible that the dish looked messy, unappetizing, or just didn't meet her expectations based on Bob's description.

In summary, while the individual components can be healthy, the overall dish might have been a bit of a culinary experiment that didn't quite hit the mark in terms of appearance or taste. [end of text]
