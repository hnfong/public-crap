The hint says: "a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived."

The answer is likely that the Succubus has the "Seduction" ability (or "Charm" in WoW Classic), which makes it very useful for crowd control and solo content, making it popular. However, the riddle says "most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though the succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing?" The hint says it's because of a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived.

Wait, the riddle says "most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though the succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing?" Actually, in Classic WoW, the Voidwalker is the initial summon from the quest, and many warlocks use it for its high health and tanking ability, especially early on. The Succubus is often considered better for leveling due to its ranged damage and seduction, but the Voidwalker is more common because it's the default pet from the quest and is easier to obtain early. The hint says "a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived." That seems contradictory: if succubus has a skill that makes them more common, then why are voidwalkers more seen? Wait, maybe the riddle is saying that succubus is actually more common than people think because of a skill, but the question says "most warlocks seen with voidwalkers." Let's parse carefully:

"In classic wow, why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though the succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing?"

So the premise is: succubus is better for leveling/questing, but most warlocks are seen with voidwalkers. Why? The hint: "it's because a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived."

Wait, maybe the hint is saying that the succubus has a skill (like "Seduction") that makes it more common than perceived, meaning that actually many warlocks do use succubus, but because of seduction they are not noticed? Or maybe it's about the "Perceived" part: "more common than perceived" means that succubus is actually more common than people think, because of a skill. But the question asks why voidwalkers are more common. Possibly the answer is that the succubus is stealthed or uses seduction to charm mobs, so you don't notice the warlock has a succubus? That seems far-fetched.

Alternatively, maybe the riddle is a play on words: "voidwalkers" are seen more because they are visible, while succubus is hidden due to "stealth"? But succubus doesn't have stealth.

Wait, in Classic WoW, the succubus has an ability called "Seduction" (or "Charm") that charms the target, making it attack the enemy? Actually, seduction charms the target, causing it to attack the warlock's enemy? No, it charms the target, making it unable to attack and instead it follows the succubus? Actually, in WoW Classic, the succubus's Seduction ability charms the target for a short duration, making it unable to attack and causing it to follow the succubus. It also deals damage over time? Let me recall: The succubus has "Seduction" (rank 1) - Charms the target for 3 sec. It also has "Lash of Pain". The voidwalker has "Shadow Bulwark" (increases armor and health, I think) and "Consume Shadows". But the key might be that the succubus is often used for "kiting" or "crowd control" and can be hidden in "Stealth"? No, warlock pets don't have stealth.

Maybe it's about the "Perceived" part: The hint says "makes them more common than perceived." That could refer to the "Perceived" word in the hint. Could it be a pun? "Perceived" might refer to "Perception"? Or maybe it's about the "Voidwalker" being more common because people think succubus is better, but voidwalker is more common because of a skill of succubus that makes it less noticeable? That doesn't make sense.

Let's think differently: In WoW Classic, warlocks often use Voidwalkers because they are tanky and can hold aggro, making them good for soloing and grinding. The succubus is more for PvP or specific encounters. But the riddle says "succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing." Is that true? Actually, many guides suggest that for leveling, the voidwalker is better because it can tank, while succubus is more for PvP. But some say succubus is better for leveling because it has ranged attacks and can seduce mobs. So it's debatable.

The hint says: "a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived." Maybe it's "Seduction" because it makes the mob "perceived" as friendly? Or maybe it's "Charm" which makes the mob "perceived" as not a threat? That could make the succubus less noticeable because the mob is charmed and not attacking, so you might not notice the warlock has a pet? But the question is about why voidwalkers are seen more. Possibly because succubus is often hidden in "Stealth"? Wait, warlock pets don't have stealth, but the succubus has a "Stealth" ability? No.

Maybe it's about the "Voidwalker" being more common because the succubus is "perceived" as less common due to its skill? That seems backwards.

Let's look at the wording: "most warlocks seen with voidwalkers" - meaning when you see a warlock out in the world, they usually have a voidwalker. "even though the succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing" - so succubus is better for leveling, but warlocks still use voidwalkers. Why? The hint says it's because of a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived. That implies that because of a skill of succubus, the succubus is more common than perceived, but the question is about why voidwalkers are more common. Wait, maybe the hint is saying that the succubus is actually more common than people think, and that explains why voidwalkers are seen more? That doesn't follow.

Perhaps the riddle is misdirection: The answer might be that the succubus is not actually better for leveling in Classic WoW. Many warlocks prefer voidwalker for its survivability. But the hint specifically mentions a skill of succubus.

Maybe it's about the "Succubus's Seduction" making it so that when you see a warlock with a succubus, the succubus is not attacking, so you might not notice it? Or maybe the succubus is often dismissed or not summoned because of its skill? 

Wait, there's another possibility: In WoW Classic, the succubus has a skill called "Deadly Poison"? No, that's a rogue ability. The succubus has "Seduction" and "Lash of Pain". The voidwalker has "Shadow Bulwark" and "Consume Shadows". 

Maybe the hint is a play on words: "more common than perceived" could mean "more common than you think" because of a skill. That is, the succubus is actually more common than people think because of its skill, but the question is about voidwalkers. So perhaps the answer is that voidwalkers are more common because succubus is less common due to its skill making it less noticeable? That seems contradictory.

Let's think about the phrase "more common than perceived." Could it be "more common than perceived" means "more common than you think" because of a skill. So the skill makes the succubus more common. But then why are voidwalkers seen more? Unless the skill makes the succubus less likely to be seen? 

Maybe the skill is "Seduction" which allows the succubus to charm mobs, so when a warlock is questing, they might have the succubus charm a mob and then kill it, but the mob is under control, so you might not notice the warlock has a pet? Or maybe the succubus is often used in PvP and not in questing, so you see more voidwalkers in the open world.

I recall that in WoW Classic, the voidwalker is the default pet from the quest "Summoning the Void" or something, so many warlocks stick with it. Also, the voidwalker is better for soloing instances or grinding, while succubus is more for PvP. But the hint says it's because of a skill of succubus.

Maybe the skill is "Lash of Pain" which is a melee attack, but that doesn't make it more common.

Another thought: In WoW Classic, the succubus has a "pet talent" called "Fel Domination" or something? No, that's a warlock talent.

Wait, maybe the hint is about "Perceived" as in "Perception" the stat? Or maybe it's about "Voidwalker" being more common because succubus is "perceived" as bad, but actually is good? That doesn't fit.

Let's look for a different angle: The riddle might be a pun. "Voidwalker" and "Succubus" are both pets. The hint says "a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived." Could it be "Seduction" because it "seduces" people into thinking succubus is rare? That doesn't make sense.

Maybe it's about the "Voidwalker" being more common because the succubus is "perceived" as a "succubus" in real life, which is a demon that is not common? That's a stretch.

I think I need to consider that the answer might be simple: In Classic WoW, the voidwalker is more common because it is obtained earlier and is easier to use for beginners. The succubus requires a level 20 quest to obtain (the "Succubus" quest?), and many warlocks don't bother. But the hint says it's because of a skill of succubus.

Wait, the succubus quest is "The Binding" (I think it's "The Binding" quest line). To get a succubus, you need to be level 20 and complete a quest, which takes some time. The voidwalker is given at level 1 or 10? Actually, the voidwalker is obtained at level 10 via the quest "Summoning the Void" or something. So voidwalker is easier to get. But the hint says it's because of a skill of succubus.

Maybe the skill is "Seduction" which makes the succubus more useful for "questing" because it can charm mobs, so you can pull mobs without aggro? But then why are voidwalkers more common? 

Perhaps the answer is that the succubus is "more common than perceived" because of its skill "Seduction" which makes it appear in many places? That doesn't work.

I think I need to accept that the hint might be pointing to "Seduction" as the skill, and the answer might be that the succubus is actually more common than people think because of seduction, but the question is about voidwalkers. Maybe the riddle is poorly worded, and the answer is simply that voidwalkers are more common because they are the default pet and easier to obtain, and the hint is a red herring? But the user said "Answer concisely."

Maybe the answer is: Because the succubus has "Seduction" which makes it better for questing, but many warlocks still use voidwalkers because they are used to it or because the succubus is harder to get. But that's not concise.

Let's think about the phrase "more common than perceived." Could it be "more common than perceived" means "more common than you think" and the skill is "Seduction" which is a "charm" effect, so the succubus is "charming" you into thinking it's rare? That's silly.

Maybe it's about the "Voidwalker" being more common because the "Succubus" is "perceived" as a "sex symbol" and is used more in PvP, so in the open world you see more voidwalkers. But the hint says "a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived."

I recall that in WoW Classic, the succubus has an ability called "Stealth" in later expansions? No, in Classic, warlock pets don't have stealth.

Wait, maybe it's about the "Voidwalker" being more common because the "Succubus" is "perceived" as a "female" and is often used by "female" players, so male players use voidwalkers? That's not likely.

I think I need to search my memory for common knowledge about WoW Classic warlock pets. The most common answer is that voidwalkers are more common because they are the first pet and are good for tanking, while succubus is more for PvP. But the hint says it's because of a skill of succubus.

Maybe the skill is "Lash of Pain" which is a ranged attack, making the succubus good for kiting, but still, voidwalkers are more common.

Another idea: In WoW Classic, the succubus has a "pet talent" called "Unholy Power" or something? No.

Let's consider the possibility that the hint is about "Perceived" as in "Perception" the warlock talent? No.

Maybe it's a play on "Voidwalker" vs "Succubus": The voidwalker is "void" and the succubus is "succubus" which in mythology is a demon that seduces people, so the skill "Seduction" makes it "more common than perceived" because it "seduced" people into thinking it's common? That's not it.

I think I should go with the most likely answer: In Classic WoW, the voidwalker is more common because it is the default pet from the quest and is easier to obtain early on. The succubus requires a quest at level 20, and many warlocks don't bother. Also, the voidwalker is better for soloing because it can tank, while the succubus is more for DPS and crowd control in groups. So the answer could be: Because the voidwalker is easier to get and better for solo grinding, which is what most warlocks do while leveling.

But the hint says it's because of a skill of succubus. Maybe the skill is "Seduction" which makes the succubus more useful for "questing" because it can charm mobs, so warlocks who use succubus level faster and are less seen because they are more efficient? That could mean that warlocks with succubus are more efficient and thus are seen less because they finish quests faster? But that's a stretch.

Maybe the answer is: Because the succubus is often used in PvP and not in PvE, so in the open world you see more voidwalkers. But the hint says "a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived."

I think I need to interpret the hint differently. The hint says: "it's because a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived." The word "them" might refer to "voidwalkers" or "warlocks"? It says "makes them more common than perceived." So "them" likely refers to "warlocks" or "voidwalkers". But the skill is of succubus, so it makes "warlocks with succubus" more common than perceived? That could be: Because of the succubus's seduction skill, warlocks with succubus are more common than you think, but you don't see them because they are using seduction? That doesn't make sense.

Maybe the skill is "Seduction" which makes the succubus "invisible" to enemies? No, it charms.

Wait, in WoW Classic, the succubus's seduction ability also deals damage? Actually, it charms the target and deals damage over time? I think it just charms.

I think I should give up and provide a simple answer: Most warlocks use voidwalkers because they are the default pet and are easier to obtain, and the succubus is often considered better for PvP but not necessarily for leveling. The hint might be misleading.

But the user said "Answer concisely." So I need to be concise.

Let's look for a pun: "Voidwalker" might be "void" as in empty, and "succubus" might be "suck" which is a skill? No.

Maybe the answer is: Because the succubus has "Seduction" which makes it "perceived" as a "pet", but it's actually a "demon", so warlocks use voidwalkers to avoid the "seductive" nature? That's not it.

I recall that in WoW Classic, the voidwalker has a skill "Consume Shadows" which allows it to hide in shadows, making it less visible? No, that's not a skill.

Another thought: The hint might be about "Perceived" as in "Perception" the ability that allows detecting stealth. But warlock pets don't have stealth.

Maybe it's about the "Voidwalker" being more common because the "Succubus" is "perceived" as a "rare" pet, but actually is common because of its skill "Seduction" which makes it easy to get? That doesn't make sense.

I think I should answer based on common knowledge: In Classic WoW, most warlocks use voidwalkers because they are the first pet and are very durable for soloing. The succubus is more fragile and is better for PvP. So the answer is: Because voidwalkers are better for solo grinding and are easier to obtain.

But the hint says it's because of a skill of succubus. Maybe the skill is "Seduction" which makes the succubus "more common than perceived" because it "seduced" many warlocks into thinking it's good, but actually voidwalkers are better? That could be: Because the succubus has seduction, many warlocks think it's good for leveling, but actually voidwalkers are better, so they use voidwalkers. But that's not what the hint says.

The hint says "makes them more common than perceived." "Them" could refer to "voidwalkers". So a skill of succubus makes voidwalkers more common than perceived. How could that be? Maybe because the succubus is so good that it makes the warlock overconfident, so they use voidwalkers? No.

I think I need to accept that I might be overthinking. Let's provide a concise answer based on the most common reason: Voidwalkers are more common because they are the default pet and are better for survivability while leveling. The hint might be a misdirection.

But the user specifically said "Hint: it's because a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived." So I should incorporate that.

Maybe the skill is "Seduction" and it makes the succubus "more common than perceived" because when you see a warlock with a succubus, the succubus is using seduction on a mob, so you think the warlock is fighting a mob, but actually the mob is charmed, so you don't notice the succubus? That could mean that warlocks with succubus are less noticeable, so you think voidwalkers are more common. But the question is "why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers?" So the answer could be: Because warlocks with succubus are less noticeable due to seduction, so you see more warlocks with voidwalkers. That is a possible interpretation.

So the answer could be: Because the succubus's seduction ability makes it less noticeable, so warlocks with succubus are often overlooked, making voidwalkers seem more common.

That seems plausible. Let's phrase it concisely.

Final answer: Because the succubus's seduction ability often makes it less noticeable, so
