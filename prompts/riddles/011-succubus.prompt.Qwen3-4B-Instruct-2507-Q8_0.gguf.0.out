Because the Succubus's "Succubus" skill (Succubus Form) allows her to be summoned more easily, but the real reason most Warlocks use Voidwalkers is due to **Voidwalker's "Voidwalk" ability**, which allows them to **teleport instantly** to any location, making them far more practical for **leveling and questing** in classic WoW â€” especially in areas with long travel times or complex zones.  

Wait â€” correction: the riddle says "why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though the succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing?"

The **hint** says: *"it's because a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived."*

So the answer must be: **The Succubus has a skill called "Succubus Form" that allows her to be summoned instantly, making her more accessible and common â€” but the riddle says "most warlocks are seen with voidwalkers" despite succubus being better for leveling.**

Actually, the **correct answer** is:

ðŸ‘‰ **Because the Succubus has a skill called "Succubus Form" that allows her to be summoned instantly, making her more common than perceived â€” but in reality, the Voidwalker is more practical for leveling due to its teleportation ability.**

But the riddle says: *"why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though the succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing?"*

So the **real answer** is:

ðŸ‘‰ **Because the Succubus's "Succubus Form" skill makes her appear more common, but in practice, the Voidwalker's "Voidwalk" ability allows faster travel, making it more useful for leveling and questing â€” hence, most warlocks use Voidwalkers.**

But the hint says: *"it's because a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived."*

So the **concise answer** is:

âœ… **Because the Succubus's "Succubus Form" skill allows her to be summoned instantly, making her appear more common â€” but Voidwalkers are actually better for leveling due to teleportation.**

Final concise answer:

**The Succubus's "Succubus Form" skill makes her seem more common, but Voidwalkers are better for leveling due to teleportation.** [end of text]
