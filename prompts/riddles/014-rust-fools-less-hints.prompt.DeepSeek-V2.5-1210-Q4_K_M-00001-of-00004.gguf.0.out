The passage provides several clues that can help us estimate when it was written. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **C++ Language Evolution**: The passage mentions C++20 and C++26, which are future versions of the language at the time of writing. C++20 was finalized in December 2020, and C++26 is expected to be finalized around 2026. The passage also mentions "stackful coroutines" and "safe range-based for loop," which are features expected in C++26. This suggests the passage was written sometime after C++20 was finalized (December 2020) but before C++26 is finalized (around 2026).

2. **Rust Language Evolution**: The passage mentions that Rust is becoming more sedate in its pace of innovation, with recent features like "generic associated types" and the forthcoming "type alias impl trait." Generic associated types were stabilized in Rust 1.65.0, which was released on November 3, 2022. This suggests the passage was written after November 2022.

3. **C++ Community and Carbon**: The passage mentions the "new C++ compatible Carbon language," which was announced in July 2022. This suggests the passage was written after July 2022.

4. **Social Media and Community**: The passage mentions the Rust community's behavior on social media, which implies recent events or trends. This suggests the passage was written relatively recently, as social media trends can quickly become outdated.

5. **Hacker News and /r/rust**: The passage mentions discussing the topic on Hacker News and /r/rust, which are active forums. This suggests the passage was written when these platforms were still relevant and active, which is currently the case.

Given these clues, the passage was likely written sometime between November 2022 and the present day (2023). The specific mention of "stackful coroutines" and "safe range-based for loop" in the context of C++26 suggests that the author is looking forward to features that are still in the planning stages, which aligns with the current timeframe.

**Best guess**: The passage was written in **2023**. [end of text]
