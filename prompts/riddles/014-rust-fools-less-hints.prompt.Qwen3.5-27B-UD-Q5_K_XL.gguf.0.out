Based on a detailed analysis of the technical references, community sentiment, and specific project mentions in the text, this passage is almost certainly a **satirical piece of fiction** (a parody) written to mock certain anti-Rust sentiments, rather than a genuine announcement from the Linebender team.

However, if we treat the text as a "time capsule" to determine when it was written based on the specific technological and cultural markers it contains, here is the deduction:

### 1. The "Smoking Gun": The Linebender Projects
The text explicitly mentions the **Linebender** projects (which include `druid`, `skia-safe`, and `resvg`).
*   **Reality Check:** The Linebender team (led by Cameron Desai and others) has been the *primary* champion of Rust for GUI toolkits. They have never announced a migration to C++. In fact, their entire existence is predicated on the success of Rust.
*   **Implication:** The text is a fabrication designed to sound like a "Rust is dead, C++ is back" announcement.

### 2. Technical Markers & Timeline
To date the *creation* of this satire, we must look at the specific features mentioned as "upcoming" or "current":

*   **"C++20 brings us modules... looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon."**
    *   C++20 was finalized in late 2020. However, the text says modules are "looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon." This suggests the author is writing **after C++20 was standardized but before modules were widely usable in major compilers**.
    *   Modules in MSVC and GCC were still maturing in **2021–2022**. By 2023/2024, they were more stable, though still not ubiquitous.

*   **"C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines..."**
    *   The C++ standardization cycle is roughly 3 years. C++23 was released in late 2023. C++26 is the next major version.
    *   The specific mention of "stackful coroutines" as a *future* feature for C++26 aligns with discussions happening around **2023–2024**. (Note: Coroutines were introduced in C++20, but "stackful" coroutines are a specific, more advanced topic often discussed for future standards).

*   **"Herb Sutter cppfront"**
    *   Herb Sutter's `cppfront` (a C++20/23 source-to-source translator) was announced and gained significant traction in **late 2022 and 2023**.

*   **"Carbon language"**
    *   Google announced the Carbon language (a successor to C++) in **August 2022**. The text mentions it as a "new C++ compatible Carbon language," implying it is a current topic of discussion.

*   **"Generic associated types (GATs) have more of the flavor of making combinations of existing features work..."**
    *   GATs were stabilized in Rust in **late 2022 (Rust 1.65)**. The text refers to them as "recently landed," placing the writing date shortly after late 2022.

*   **"Type alias impl trait"**
    *   This feature (often called `type_alias_impl_trait`) was stabilized in **Rust 1.79 (August 2024)**.
    *   *Correction/Refinement:* If the text says "forthcoming," it must be written *before* August 2024. If it says "recently landed," it's after. The text says "forthcoming," which suggests a date **before August 2024**.

### 3. Cultural Markers
*   **The "Rust Community" Stereotype:** The text mocks the Rust community for being "imperious," "demanding rewrites," and having a "Code of Conduct" that the author views as "politics."
*   **The "C++ Community" Stereotype:** The text claims the C++ subreddit is "well known for their sense of humor" and "nicer."
*   **Context:** This specific type of "Rust is too political, C++ is just code" rhetoric saw a massive resurgence in **2023 and 2024**, often triggered by debates around the Rust Foundation's governance, the "Rust for Linux" kernel integration, and general fatigue with the "Rust is the only way" narrative.

### 4. The "Outside the Box" Conclusion
The text is a **satire** likely written by a member of the Rust community (or a sympathetic observer) to highlight the absurdity of the arguments used by C++ proponents who claim Rust is "unstable" or "too political."

The specific combination of:
1.  **GATs** being "recently landed" (Late 2022).
2.  **Type alias impl trait** being "forthcoming" (Before Aug 2024).
3.  **Cppfront** and **Carbon** being active topics (2022–2023).
4.  **C++20 Modules** still being "soon" (2022–2023).

**Most Likely Date of Writing:**
The text was likely written between **late 2023 and early 2024**.

*   **Why not 2022?** `cppfront` and the specific hype around Carbon were just starting; the "Rust is too political" narrative wasn't as crystallized in this specific "Linebender" parody format.
*   **Why not 2024 (mid-year)?** By mid-2024, `type_alias_impl_trait` was stabilized (Aug 2024), so calling it "forthcoming" would be slightly off, though possible if written in early 2024.
*   **The "Linebender" Joke:** The joke relies on the reader knowing that Linebender is the *most* Rust-centric GUI project. The satire works best when the "Rust fatigue" narrative is at its peak, which was heavily discussed in **2023** (e.g., the "Rust is not for everyone" debates).

### Final Verdict
This is a **satirical post** written approximately in **early 2024** (likely **January to March 2024**).

It was likely posted on **Hacker News** or **/r/rust** as a "troll" or "thought experiment" to provoke a reaction, given the explicit instruction at the end: "Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust." The author is mocking the idea that a major Rust GUI project would abandon Rust for C++ due to "safety" concerns, using hyperbolic arguments (e.g., "GUI crashes aren't a big deal," "I can avoid CVEs") that are widely considered incorrect in the industry.

**Date Estimate:** **February 2024** (give or take a month). [end of text]
