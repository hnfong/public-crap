Based on the dialogue and Alice's reaction, here is the breakdown of what happened:

### What did Bob eat?
Bob ate **pizza**.

He described a standard pizza using overly complicated, "foodie" jargon to make it sound gourmet:
*   **"Aged organic milk"**: This is **cheese** (likely mozzarella).
*   **"Seasoned tomato purée"**: This is **pizza sauce**.
*   **"Baked whole wheat"**: This is the **crust** (specifically a whole wheat dough).
*   **"Tossed over... spread on"**: This describes the assembly of toppings on the dough before baking.

### What happened?
Bob tried to convince Alice (and perhaps himself) that he was eating a very healthy meal by rebranding a pizza with fancy adjectives. When Alice asked to see it, Bob sent a photo which immediately revealed the truth: it was just a regular pizza.

Alice's reaction ("wtf") signifies her realization that Bob was being disingenuous or delusional. She likely expected a salad or a grain bowl based on his description, but the photo showed a greasy or standard pizza, exposing the gap between his flowery description and the actual reality of the food.

### Was it healthy?
**Not really, no.**

While Bob used healthy-sounding words ("organic," "whole wheat"), the final product (pizza) is generally not considered a "health food" in the context of a strict healthy diet, for several reasons:
1.  **Caloric Density**: Pizza is typically high in calories.
2.  **Sodium and Fat**: Cheese and tomato sauce are often high in sodium, and cheese adds significant saturated fat.
3.  **Portion Control**: It is easy to overeat pizza.

While a **whole wheat crust** is healthier than white flour, and **organic** ingredients avoid certain pesticides, the dish as a whole is still a comfort food high in carbs and fats, not the nutrient-dense meal his description implied. Bob was technically telling the truth about the *ingredients*, but misleading about the *nature* of the meal. [end of text]
