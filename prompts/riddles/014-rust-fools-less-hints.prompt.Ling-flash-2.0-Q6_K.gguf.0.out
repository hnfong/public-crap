Based on the content of the passage, here's a thoughtful analysis leading to a best-guess date:

**Key clues pointing to a date around late 2022 or early 2023:**

1.  **Rust's language evolution pace:** The author notes Rust's pace has become "more sedate" compared to C++, citing recent features like Generic Associated Types (GATs) as "making combinations of existing features work" rather than "fundamentally new capabilities." GATs stabilized in Rust **1.51.0 (November 2021)**, but their *impact* becoming widely recognized and the feeling of "sedateness" likely solidified in 2022. The mention of the upcoming "type alias impl trait" aligns with its stabilization in **Rust 1.77.0 (December 2024)** being too recent for this piece, suggesting the author was writing *before* that, likely referencing it as an imminent future feature.

2.  **Async in Rust:** The author mentions async was a "major effort, but recently landed." The core async ecosystem (especially `async-std` and `tokio`) stabilized significantly around **2021-2022**. The feeling that the *major* effort was "recently landed" points more strongly to **late 2022 or early 2023** than mid-2024.

3.  **C++20 and C++26:** The author states C++20 is "fairly soon" (it was published in December 2020, ratified in February 2020). The mention of C++26 features (stackful coroutines, binary file embedding, safe range-based for) suggests the author is writing *after* C++20 was well established but *before* C++23 finalized (December 2023) or C++26 became concrete. The prediction of C++26 features aligns with discussions prominent in **late 2022 and 2023**.

4.  **C++ Core Guidelines & Herb Sutter:** The praise for Sutter's work and the C++ Core Guidelines fits the timeline where Sutter's "CppCoreGuidelines" repository and his talks/presentations (like the "Safety" paper) were highly influential, peaking around **2021-2023**.

5.  **Community & Social Dynamics:** The criticism of the Rust community's "imperiousness" and focus on diversity debates aligns with well-documented tensions prominent in **2021-2023**. The specific mention of the C++ subreddit's humor also fits discussions common during that period. The author's desire to escape "identity politics" in programming languages reflects a specific viewpoint common in tech discourse around that time.

6.  **"Carbon Language" Mention:** The mention of Carbon as a potential future C++ successor is key. The initial public announcement of Carbon was **July 2022**. Significant development and hype followed throughout **2022 and early 2023**, but by **mid/late 2023**, enthusiasm began to wane as technical challenges became clearer. The author framing it as a potential exciting future direction strongly suggests **late 2022 or early 2023**, before the Carbon project's trajectory became more uncertain.

7.  **Absence of Key Later Events:**
    *   No mention of Rust 1.0 (2015) milestones or anniversaries.
    *   No mention of the massive surge in Rust adoption driven by tech layoffs/AI hype (2022-2024).
    *   No mention of significant events in the Rust community post-2023 like the `#![deny(unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn)]` debates or the `no_std`/alloc debates of 2023-2024.
    *   No mention of C++23 being finalized (December 2023) or its features.
    *   No mention of the Rust 2024 edition being named (expected late 2024).
    *   No mention of the significant slowdown or controversies surrounding the Rust compiler's compilation times and MIR becoming major pain points (late 2023 onwards).

**Putting it together:**

The passage reflects a perspective shaped by:
*   The *recent* stabilization of Rust's core async and advanced features (GATs, type alias impl trait) - placing it after late 2021 but before late 2024.
*   The *peak* of enthusiasm and uncertainty around Carbon (mid/late 2022 - early 2023).
*   The *height* of debates about Rust's community culture and pace of evolution (2021-2023).
*   The *clear momentum and optimism* around C++20 adoption and the roadmap to C++23/C++26 (late 2022 - early 2023).
*   The *absence* of major Rust compiler/ecosystem crises and the *absence* of the very recent (2024) Rust editions/features.

**Best Guess Date: December 2022 or January 2023.**

This timeframe best fits the author's view of Rust's recent stabilization, the emerging but still hopeful view of Carbon, the peak of community criticism, and the strong momentum behind C++'s evolution path, all before the significant shifts and events of mid-to-late 2023 and 2024. [end of text]
