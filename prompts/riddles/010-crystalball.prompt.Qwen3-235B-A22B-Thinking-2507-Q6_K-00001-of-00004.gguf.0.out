Okay, the user shared a short story about a woman buying a crystal ball and the clerk's warning to cover it when leaving the house. The lady asks if it's because of spirits, but the clerk's real reason is probably more practical. 

Hmm, this feels like a classic misdirection trope. The supernatural angle ("spirits?") is a red herringâ€”the actual reason is likely mundane but clever. Let me think... crystal balls are glass spheres, right? If left uncovered in a car or pocket, they could act like a magnifying glass focusing sunlight. 

*Lightbulb moment*â€”oh! It's about fire risk. Sunlight through a crystal ball can concentrate rays to ignite flammable materials, like car seats or curtains. That's why you'd cover it. The clerk's warning makes perfect sense for safety, not superstition. 

User probably enjoys puzzle-like stories, so I should explain the science clearly but concisely. No need for jargonâ€”just "focusing sunlight = fire hazard." They'll appreciate the "aha!" moment. 

...Also, good thing the lady didn't assume it was ghosts. Practical thinking saves lives!

The clerk's warning is **not about spirits**â€”it's a **practical safety precaution**.  

A crystal ball acts like a **lens**, focusing sunlight to a single point. If left uncovered in a car, pocket, or near flammable materials (e.g., curtains, paper, or upholstery), it can **concentrate the sun's rays enough to start a fire**. Covering it blocks this risk.  

The clerkâ€™s advice is rooted in **physics, not superstition**â€”a real hazard with glass spheres. ðŸ”¥ [end of text]
