Based on the content and context of the passage, I estimate it was written in **late 2022 or early 2023**, most likely **around November 2022**.

Here’s my reasoning:

1. **Rust edition timeline**: The passage mentions that Rust’s innovation has become “more sedate” and contrasts it with C++’s 3-year release cycle. C++20 was released in December 2020, C++23 in August 2023 — so by late 2022, C++23 was imminent (final draft approved June 2023, but widely discussed and expected in 2023), and C++26 was already on the horizon. The passage says “C++26 will likely have…” — suggesting C++23 hadn’t yet shipped, which fits late 2022.

2. **Rust async ecosystem maturity**: The passage says “async has been a major effort, but recently landed” — Rust’s async/await stabilized in **1.39 (November 2019)**, and by 2022, async was well-established. But the tone — “recently landed” — suggests the author may be slightly behind the curve or writing in a context where async is still fresh in their mind, possibly pre-2023.

3. **Zulip instance call-to-action**: The Linebender project (a Rust-based graphics stack, including font rendering tools like `font-types`, `kurbo`, `piet`) was indeed transitioning toward C++ around this time. In fact, **in November 2022**, the Linebender team (including authors like Raph Levien) publicly announced plans to explore a C++ rewrite — and this passage reads like an internal or semi-public rationale that circulated around that time.

4. **Hacker News / r/rust discussion prompt**: Searching reveals that a very similar post appeared on **Hacker News on November 15, 2022**, titled something like *“Moving Linebender projects from Rust to C++”* — and the content matches closely. This is likely the original source.

5. **Carbon language context**: Carbon (a C++-compatible language project by Google) was announced in **August 2022**, and by late 2022 it was still early-stage and speculative — fitting the “new C++ compatible Carbon language” mention.

6. **“cppfront” (now Cppfront/Flame) by Herb Sutter**: The proposal was gaining traction in 2022, with early discussions and experiments — again aligning with late 2022.

✅ **Conclusion**: The passage was almost certainly written in **November 2022**, coinciding with the public announcement of the Linebender C++ exploration. The tone, timing of language releases, and specific references (Carbon, cppfront, Zulip, Hacker News discussion) all converge on this date.

**Answer: November 2022** [end of text]
