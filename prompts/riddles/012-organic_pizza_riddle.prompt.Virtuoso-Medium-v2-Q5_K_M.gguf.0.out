Bob's response to Alice's question about eating healthy was quite exaggerated and humorous. He described his meal as "aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat." This description is intentionally absurd and nonsensical, as it doesn't make sense to toss milk over tomato purée and spread it on baked whole wheat.

The photo Bob sent to Alice likely depicted something that was not what he described, which is why Alice's response was "wtf" (an abbreviation for "what the f***"). It's possible that Bob was joking or being sarcastic about his eating habits, and the photo he sent was meant to be humorous or ironic.

In terms of whether Bob's meal was healthy, it's difficult to determine based on the absurd description. However, if we were to take the ingredients at face value, aged organic milk, seasoned tomato purée, and baked whole wheat could potentially be part of a healthy meal. But the way Bob described combining these ingredients is not a typical or practical way to prepare a meal.

Overall, Bob's response was likely meant to be humorous or sarcastic, and the actual content of his meal is unclear from the given information. [end of text]
