 Based on the content and context of the passage, it appears to have been written sometime in the early to mid-2020s. Here are some clues that support this estimation:

1. **C++20 and C++26 Mentions**: The passage mentions C++20 and anticipates features in C++26. C++20 was released in 2020, and C++26 is expected to be released in 2026. The mention of C++26 features suggests that the passage was written after the release of C++20 but before the release of C++26.

2. **Rust Language Features**: The passage discusses Rust features like "generic associated types" and "type alias impl trait," which were either recently landed or forthcoming at the time of writing. These features were being actively discussed and developed in the Rust community around 2020-2022.

3. **Community and Social Media References**: The mention of social media and the Rust community's behavior suggests a time when online communities and discussions about programming languages were prevalent, which is characteristic of the 2020s.

4. **Herb Sutter's cppfront and Carbon Language**: The passage mentions Herb Sutter's proposal for a new syntax (cppfront) and the Carbon language, which were topics of discussion in the C++ community around 2021-2022.

5. **Zulip Instance**: The invitation to join a Zulip instance for collaboration suggests a time when Zulip was a popular choice for open-source project communication, which is also characteristic of the early to mid-2020s.

Considering these factors, a reasonable guess for the date this passage was written would be around 2021-2022. [end of text]
