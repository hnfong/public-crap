We are given a short story:

  A woman buys a crystal ball from an antique shop.
  As she pays, the clerk says, "Be sure to cover it when you leave your house."
  The lady asked "Why? Spirits?"

We are to explain concisely why the clerk said this.

Analysis:

The clerk's instruction to cover the crystal ball when leaving the house is unusual. The lady's immediate thought is about "spirits", which suggests a supernatural association. However, we must consider if there is a more practical reason.

Crystal balls are often associated with fortune-telling and the supernatural. But note that the clerk is giving a practical instruction about covering it when leaving the house. Why would leaving the house require covering the crystal ball?

One common practical reason for covering objects, especially glass or crystal, is to prevent sunlight from focusing through them and causing a fire. A crystal ball is a spherical lens that can concentrate sunlight, acting as a magnifying glass. If left uncovered near a window or in direct sunlight, it could focus the sun's rays onto a surface and potentially start a fire.

Therefore, the clerk's warning is likely a safety precaution to prevent accidental fires.

Conclusion:

The clerk said this to prevent the crystal ball from acting as a lens and focusing sunlight, which could start a fire in the house when the lady is away.

The clerk's instruction to cover the crystal ball when leaving the house is a safety precaution, not a supernatural one. Crystal balls, being spherical lenses, can concentrate sunlight if left uncovered near windows. This focused light can ignite flammable materials (like curtains or furniture), potentially causing a fire. The warning is practical, addressing a real hazard rather than spirits. [end of text]
