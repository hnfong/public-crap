The passage was most likely written on **April 1st**, i.e., **April Fools' Day**.

### Why April 1st?

Let’s analyze the text and the hint:

> "The hint is the distinctive writing style of the article which is connected to one particular day and month of the year."

This suggests that the date is not just any date, but one that is thematically or stylistically tied to the content — possibly a **joke**, **satire**, or **hoax**.

Now, let’s look at the content of the passage:

1. **Tone and Satirical Elements**:
   - The author expresses frustration with Rust, then abruptly switches to praising C++ — but in a way that feels exaggerated or tongue-in-cheek.
   - The line: *"I firmly believe that programming languages should be free of politics, focused strictly on the technology itself. In computer science, we have moved beyond prejudice and discrimination. I understand how some identity groups may desire more representation, but I feel it is not necessary."* — is written in a tone that feels deliberately provocative and out of touch, especially in the context of modern open-source communities. This kind of rhetoric is often used in satirical or parody writing.
   - The author claims to have written CVEs but says they're not worried — again, this feels like someone poking fun at Rust's safety guarantees.

2. **C++26 and Cppfront**:
   - The mention of C++26 features and Herb Sutter’s cppfront is accurate for the time around 2021–2022, but the way the author frames the future of C++ as wildly innovative compared to Rust’s slower evolution could be a hyperbolic take — again, fitting for a satirical piece.

3. **The most telling line**:
   - *"We’re looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite. If you’re interested, please join our Zulip instance. Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust."*
     - This is the **clincher**. The author is asking for help to rewrite a project from Rust to C++ — a move that would be absurd or ironic to many in the tech community. This is the kind of thing you'd expect someone to post on **April Fools' Day** to a forum like Hacker News or Reddit.

4. **The final jab**:
   - *"The Rust community is also known for its code of conduct and other policies promoting diversity. I firmly believe that programming languages should be free of politics..."* — This is a classic April Fools' bait-and-switch: pretending to be a reasonable person while making obviously inflammatory or outdated statements, as a parody of contrarian takes.

5. **The date clue**:
   - The passage ends with: *"Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust."* — which are real platforms where April Fools' jokes are often posted.
   - Additionally, the author is clearly writing with a tongue-in-cheek, almost parody tone — a hallmark of April Fools' content.

### Why not another date?

- The mention of **C++20** and **C++26** places the writing in the 2020s.
- The reference to **Zulip** (which was acquired by GitHub in 2019 and is still used by some Rust projects) and the general state of the Rust ecosystem suggests a time after 2020.
- The **Rust community's reputation for enforcing codes of conduct** became especially prominent around 2018–2019, so this is consistent with a 2021–2023
