Based on the distinctive writing style and content of the passage, I believe this was written as an April Fools' Day joke, specifically on April 1, 2022.

Here's my reasoning:

1. **The hint about "distinctive writing style" connected to a particular day and month**: The passage is written in a highly satirical and ironic tone, which is characteristic of April Fools' Day (April 1st) jokes in the tech community. The author makes several outrageous claims that are clearly intended to be humorous rather than serious.

2. **Contradictory and exaggerated arguments**:
   - The author claims to be moving from Rust to C++ for "stable, mature foundation," but C++ is known for its complexity and legacy issues, while Rust is celebrated for modern safety.
   - The author dismisses memory safety concerns, despite having a history of CVEs (like font parsing in Android), which is ironic given Rust's primary selling point.
   - The praise for C++'s rapid evolution and adoption of new features is exaggerated, as C++ is known for slow standardization and implementation, while Rust has been innovating quickly.
   - The claim that the C++ community is "much nicer and friendlier" is humorous, as online communities for both languages have their quirks, and Rust is generally known for being welcoming and inclusive.
   - The dismissal of diversity efforts and code of conduct is contrary to the values typically promoted in the Rust community.

3. **Specific technical references that date the piece**:
   - Mention of C++20 modules (released in 2020) and looking forward to C++26 (which would be in the future).
   - Reference to "type alias impl trait" (TAIT) in Rust, which was not stabilized until 2023, but was being discussed in 2022.
   - Mention of Herb Sutter's cppfront (announced in 2022) and Carbon (announced in mid-2022).
   - The Linebender projects are real (e.g., piet-gpu, vello) and are primarily in Rust, not C++.

4. **Community context**:
   - The author is likely parodying Raph Levien, a prominent Rust contributor (working on GUI tools like druid) who would never seriously make such arguments.
   - The mention of "Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust" is a common way to spark engagement for April Fools' jokes.

5. **Timing**: The references to cppfront and Carbon (both announced in 2022) and the state of Rust features (like TAIT not yet stabilized) suggest this was written in 2022. April Fools' Day 2022 is the most likely date.

Thus, the passage is a satirical April Fools' joke written on April 1, 2022. The "distinctive writing style" is the exaggerated, ironic tone typical of such jokes. [end of text]
