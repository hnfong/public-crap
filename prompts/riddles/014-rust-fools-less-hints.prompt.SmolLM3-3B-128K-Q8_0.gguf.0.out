Based on the content and tone of the passage, I would estimate that this was written in the late 2010s or early 2020s. Here's why:

1. **Language and Technology Focus**: The author mentions Rust and C++ as the primary languages of interest, which were both gaining significant traction in the mid-2010s. Rust was becoming more popular as a systems programming language, and C++ was still a dominant language in many areas.

2. **Build Systems and Language Features**: The author discusses Cargo, CMake, and other build systems, which were common in the mid-2010s. The mention of C++20 and C++26 features (e.g., modules, stackful coroutines) suggests that the author is familiar with the C++ standard evolution, which was happening around this time.

3. **Community and Social Media**: The author mentions social media and the Rust community's perceived imperiousness, which is a common topic of discussion in the mid-2010s. The author also references the C++ subreddit's sense of humor, which is a known aspect of the C++ community.

4. **Language Evolution**: The author's comments on Rust's slower pace of innovation compared to C++'s rapid adoption of new features (e.g., C++20, C++26) suggest that the Rust community was still in a phase of maturation around this time.

5. **C++ Leadership**: The author praises Stroustrup's paper on safety, which was published in 2018, indicating that the author was likely familiar with this document and its influence on the C++ community.

Considering these factors, I would estimate that the passage was written in the late 2010s or early 2020s, likely between 2017 and 2020. [end of text]
