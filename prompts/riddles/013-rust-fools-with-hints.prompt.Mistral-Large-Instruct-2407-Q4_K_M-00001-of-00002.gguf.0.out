 The distinctive writing style and the specific mention of "C++26" and "C++20" suggest that this passage was written in a timeframe where these versions of C++ were either recently released or anticipated. Additionally, the mention of "C++26" implies that the author is looking forward to features that are expected to be released in the future, which would place the writing of this passage sometime after the release of C++20 but before the release of C++26.

C++20 was released in 2020, and C++26 is expected to be released in 2026. Given the author's anticipation of features in C++26, it is likely that this passage was written sometime between 2020 and 2026.

However, the hint about the distinctive writing style connected to one particular day and month of the year suggests that there might be a specific date associated with this style. One notable day that is often associated with distinctive writing styles and satirical or humorous content is April Fools' Day, which falls on April 1st.

Considering the tone of the passage, which includes elements of satire and humor (e.g., the mention of the C++ subreddit being known for their sense of humor and the exaggerated praise of C++), it is plausible that this passage was written as an April Fools' Day joke.

Therefore, my best guess is that this passage was written on April 1st, sometime between 2020 and 2026. The distinctive writing style and the satirical tone align with the tradition of April Fools' Day, making this a likely date for the writing of this passage. [end of text]
