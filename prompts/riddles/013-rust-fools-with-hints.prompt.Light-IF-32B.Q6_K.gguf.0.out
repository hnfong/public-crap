The passage was likely written on **December 25th**.

### Explanation of the Hint and Reasoning:

The key to solving this lies in the **distinctive writing style** mentioned in the hint, which is connected to a **particular day and month**. While the passage itself contains no explicit date, the **tone, structure, and content** suggest a **personal reflection** or **announcement** that aligns with a **seasonal or symbolic moment**—and the most distinctive clue is the **closing line**:

> "Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust."

This is a **very specific and unusual detail** for a personal reflection. Most people writing about switching languages or community frustrations would not include such a direct call to discuss on those platforms *unless* it was part of a **public announcement** or **blog post** meant to be shared immediately.

Now, let’s think about **when people make public announcements** about switching languages or projects. Often, such posts are timed to **maximize visibility**—for example, on **Hacker News** or **Reddit**. But the **most distinctive clue** is the **writing style**: the author is **reflective, nostalgic, and critical** of Rust, but also **forward-looking** about C++. This tone is reminiscent of **year-end reflections**—people often take stock of their work, frustrations, and future plans at the **end of the year**.

But wait—there’s an even more **specific** clue that connects to the **hint about a "distinctive writing style connected to one particular day and month"**. Let’s look at the **conclusion**:

> "Rust was a good experiment, and there are aspects I will look back on fondly, but it is time to take the Linebender projects to a mature, production-ready language."

This is a **personal, public turning point**—a moment of closure and new beginnings. Such moments are often framed in **seasonal or symbolic terms**. And here’s the key: the **author includes a call to join the C++ community** and **invites collaboration**—this is a **public-facing announcement**, not a private diary entry.

Now, let’s think about **when such an announcement would be made** to maximize visibility on Hacker News and Reddit. The **best time** to get attention on those platforms is when **traffic is high**. And **Hacker News traffic is notoriously low on weekends and holidays**, but **very high on weekdays**—especially **Monday mornings**.

But wait—there’s a **more symbolic** moment: **December 25th**. Why? Because the author is **closing a chapter** (Rust) and **opening a new one** (C++). December 25th is **Christmas Day**—a day of **closure, reflection, and new beginnings**. It’s a day when people often **take stock** of the year, and **make plans for the future**. The tone of the passage—nostalgic, critical, forward-looking—fits **perfectly** with a **year-end reflection**.

Moreover, the **writing style** is **personal, candid, and unapologetic**—this is not a formal announcement, but a **personal blog post**. People often write such posts **on days when they have time to reflect**—and **December 25th** is a day when many people are **off work**, **with time to write**.

### Additional Supporting Clues:

- The author mentions **"Linebender projects"**—this is a **real project** (Linebender is a company that builds GUI toolkits in Rust). The fact that the author is making a **public announcement** about switching to C++ suggests this is a **real-world decision**, and such decisions are often made **at the end of the year** to align with new goals for the next year.
- The **comparison to C++20 and C++2
