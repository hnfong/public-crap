It's difficult to determine the exact date this was written, but it's likely sometime in the 2010s, given the discussion of Rust and C++ and their respective ecosystems and features.

Here are some key points that suggest this time period:

- The author mentions C++20, which was released in 2020, indicating that the passage was likely written after that date.
- The author also mentions Rust's async feature, which was a major effort at the time, suggesting that the passage was likely written after that feature was introduced.
- The author's discussion of C++'s rapid adoption of new features and the pace of innovation in Rust also suggest that the passage was likely written during a period of significant development and change in both languages.

However, without more specific information or context, it's impossible to pinpoint the exact date with certainty.

Here are some additional details that might be helpful in narrowing down the date:

- The author mentions the C++ subreddit's sense of humor, which could suggest that the passage was written after the subreddit became popular. The C++ subreddit was created in 2012, so this could be a clue.
- The author also mentions the Rust community's code of conduct and policies promoting diversity, which could suggest that the passage was written after these policies were introduced. The Rust project was started in 2010, so this could be another clue.

Overall, while it's difficult to determine the exact date, these details suggest that the passage was likely written sometime in the 2010s, during a period of significant development and change in both Rust and C++.
