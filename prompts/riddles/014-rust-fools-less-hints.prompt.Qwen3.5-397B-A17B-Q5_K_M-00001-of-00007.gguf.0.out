Based on a detailed analysis of the technical references, project timelines, and the satirical nature of the text, here is the deduction for when this was written.

### 1. The "Smoking Gun": Technical Anachronisms
The most definitive clue lies in the section titled **"Language evolution."**

*   **The Text Claims:** "C++20 brings us modules... looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon."
    *   **Reality:** C++20 was officially published in **December 2020**. By early 2021, major compilers (GCC, Clang, MSVC) had varying degrees of support, but "modules" were notoriously difficult to use in production for some time after. Mentioning them as a fresh feature expected "soon" places the text shortly after late 2020.
*   **The Text Claims:** "Looking forward, C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines..."
    *   **Reality:** This is the critical error.
        *   **C++23** (published mid-2023) introduced `std::expected`, improved modules, and some coroutine fixes, but *not* stackful coroutines.
        *   **Stackful coroutines** (often discussed under proposals like `executors` or specific coroutine extensions) have been a long-standing wish list item but were **never** a locked-in feature for C++26 at the time of writing. In fact, as of late 2023/early 2024, the C++26 feature set is still being debated, and stackful coroutines are considered a massive, controversial change unlikely to land so quickly.
        *   More importantly, the text treats C++26 features as "likely" and concrete, which suggests a timeline where C++23 has just passed or is passing, and the author is speculating wildly about the next cycle.
*   **The Text Claims:** Rust's "forthcoming 'type alias impl trait'".
    *   **Reality:** The feature `type_alias_impl_trait` (TAIT) has been "forthcoming" in Rust for years. It was stabilized in **Rust 1.79.0**, released on **May 2, 2024**. Before that, it was available only on nightly with feature flags for a long time. Describing it as "forthcoming" suggests the text was written *before* May 2024, likely when it was still a hot topic on the nightly channel or just about to stabilize.

### 2. Project Context: Linebender
*   **The Text Claims:** "We haven't firmly decided on a build system for the Linebender projects yet..."
*   **Reality:** Linebender is a real organization (founded by Raph Levien) dedicated to building GUI infrastructure in Rust (projects like `Xilem`, `Druid`, `Glazier`).
*   **Contradiction:** The Linebender organization is famously and fundamentally pro-Rust. Their entire mission statement is to build these tools *in Rust*. The idea that they are rewriting everything in C++ and evaluating CMake is **factually false** in the real world.
*   **Inference:** Since the premise (Linebender abandoning Rust for C++) is false, the text is not a genuine announcement. It is a **satire** or a **hoax**.

### 3. Tone and Satirical Markers
The text is filled with exaggerated stereotypes that betray its satirical nature:
*   **C++ Safety:** The author claims memory safety bugs in GUIs "aren't that big a deal" and that they are too good a programmer to cause CVEs. This is a direct mockery of common C++ apologia arguments.
*   **C++ Community:** The claim that the C++ subreddit is "well known for their sense of humor" and "nicer and friendlier" than the Rust community is a heavy-handed joke. The C++ community is often stereotyped (fairly or unfairly) as gatekeeping and hostile, while Rust is stereotyped as having a strict Code of Conduct. The author flips these tropes to an absurd degree.
*   **"Politics":** The paragraph dismissing diversity and codes of conduct as "politics" that computer science has "moved beyond" is a caricature of a specific type of tech contrarianism, likely inserted to provoke a reaction.

### 4. Synthesizing the Date
If this is a piece of satire, when would it be most effective?
*   It needs to be written when **C++20** is recent enough to be discussed as "new" but **C++23** is either just released or imminent, allowing the author to make up fake features for **C++26**.
*   It needs to be written when **Rust's TAIT** is still "forthcoming" (pre-May 2024).
*   It needs to be written when the "Rust vs. C++" culture war is at a peak.

**The Specific Clue:** The mention of **C++26** having "stackful coroutines" as a "likely" feature is a very specific prediction. In **late 2023 and early 2024**, there was significant discussion in the C++ community about the limitations of stackless coroutines (introduced in C++20) and hopes for future improvements. A satirist would seize on this hope and exaggerate it into a guaranteed C++26 feature to mock C++'s promise of "safety" and "modernization."

Furthermore, the reference to **Herb Sutter's paper on safety** likely refers to his ongoing work (part of the C++ Core Guidelines and his role at Microsoft/ISO) which has been prominent from 2020–2024.

**The "Tell":** The text mimics the style of a "Goodbye Rust" blog post, which became a genre of meme in the Rust community whenever a high-profile project faced difficulties. The specific combination of:
1.  C++20 being "new" (Modules implemented "soon").
2.  TAIT being "forthcoming" (Pre-May 2024).
3.  The absurdity of Linebender switching to C++.

This suggests the text was written **very recently**, likely as a reaction to the hype around C++23/26 proposals or a specific event in the Rust community (like a delay in a major release or a controversy).

However, there is one final check: **C++23 was finalized in early 2023.** If the author says C++20 brings modules (true) and looks forward to C++26, they are skipping C++23 entirely or implying we are currently between C++20 and C++26.
*   If written in **2021**: C++23 would be the "future," not C++26.
*   If written in **2022**: C++23 would be the immediate future.
*   If written in **2023/2024**: C++23 is done/current, so looking to C++26 makes sense chronologically.

The phrase "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines" sounds like a prediction made **in early 2024**, perhaps reacting to the slow progress of C++23 adoption or specific proposals floating around the ISO committee meetings in late 2023. The stabilization of TAIT in May 2024 makes "forthcoming" fit perfectly for **early 2024**.

**Conclusion on Nature:** This is almost certainly a piece of **satire written by a Rust enthusiast** (or someone deeply embedded in the community) mocking C++ proponents. The "Linebender switching to C++" premise is the ultimate punchline because it is the least likely event possible.

**Estimated Date:**
The text references C++20 as established but new, treats C++23 as implicitly passed or irrelevant, and speculates on C++26. It describes Rust's TAIT as "forthcoming" (stabilized May 2024). Therefore, it must be written **between late 2023 and April 2024**.

Given the specificity of the "C++26 stackful coroutines" prediction (which aligns with discussions in the C++ standards committee in late 2023/early 2024 regarding the shortcomings of C++20 coroutines), and the "forthcoming" status of TAIT:

**Best Guess:** **March 2024**

*(Note: If this is a real trick question and the text is actually from the future or a very specific alternate reality simulation, the internal logic still points to the "current" moment being just before May 2024. However, given the absurdity of the claims, it is highly probable this is a fictional piece created in **early 2024** to satirize the ongoing language wars.)*

**Final Answer Formulation:**
The passage is a **satirical hoax** (indicated by the impossible premise of Linebender abandoning Rust for C++ and the exaggerated praise of C++ safety/community).

Based on the technical markers:
1.  **C++20 Modules** are described as new/implementing soon.
2.  **C++26** is the next major horizon mentioned (skipping detailed mention of C++23 implies C++23 is already "done" or the author is projecting far ahead).
3.  **Rust's `type_alias_impl_trait`** is described as "forthcoming." This feature was stabilized in **May 2024**.
4.  The prediction of **stackful coroutines in C++26** reflects discussions prevalent in the C++ community in **late 2023 and early 2024**.

Therefore, the text was written shortly before the stabilization of TAIT in Rust, likely in **Q1 2024 (January – March 2024)**.

**Date:** **March 2024** [end of text]
