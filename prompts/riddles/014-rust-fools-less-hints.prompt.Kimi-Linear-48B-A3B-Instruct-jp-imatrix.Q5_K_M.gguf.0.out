Based on the passage, this was written around **mid-2020**. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Rust Ecosystem Frustrations**: The author mentions "the near-monoculture of the Cargo build system" and frustration with Rust's ecosystem, which aligns with known tensions in the Rust community around that time (e.g., debates about Cargo's limitations and the rise of alternative build systems like Bazel).

2. **C++20 and C++26 Mentions**: The passage references C++20's modules and C++26's features (stackful coroutines, etc.), which were still speculative or in early development stages in mid-2020. C++26 was not yet finalized, and its features were largely theoretical at the time.

3. **Rust Edition Mechanism**: The criticism of Rust's "edition mechanism" (which prevents breaking changes) reflects a common frustration in the Rust community around 2019–2020, as the language was maturing but becoming more conservative in breaking changes.

4. **Community Tone**: The passage's tone about the Rust community being "imperious" and "demanding" aligns with known criticisms from that era, particularly around 2019–2020, when Rust was gaining popularity but also facing backlash for its perceived elitism.

5. **No Later References**: There are no mentions of events or features from 2021 or later (e.g., Rust 2021 edition, C++23, or later C++ standards), which supports the mid-2020 timeframe.

Thus, the passage likely dates to **mid-2020**, when these tensions and discussions were most salient in the Rust and C++ communities. [end of text]
