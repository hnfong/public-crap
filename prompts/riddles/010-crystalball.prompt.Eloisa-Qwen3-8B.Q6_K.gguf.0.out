Okay, the user provided a short story and asked why the clerk told the woman to cover the crystal ball when she leaves her house. The story is pretty straightforward, but I need to figure out the clerk's reasoning.

First, the clerk says, "Be sure to cover it when you leave your house." The woman responds with, "Why? Spirits?" So, the clerk is probably implying that the crystal ball can attract spirits or something supernatural. The woman's question suggests she's aware of the possibility of spirits, so the clerk's advice is likely a warning related to that.

Crystal balls are often associated with divination and the supernatural in folklore. People might believe they can channel or attract spirits if left uncovered. The clerk's advice to cover it might be to prevent unwanted entities from entering or being drawn to the home. 

I should make sure the explanation is concise. The key points are the supernatural association with crystal balls and the idea of protecting the home by covering it. The clerk's warning is probably to keep spirits away or prevent them from being attracted by the uncovered crystal ball.
