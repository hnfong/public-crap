The passage is likely written on or around April 1st, which is April Fool's Day. This conclusion is based on several key aspects of the text that align with the tradition of April Fool's pranks:

1. **Unrealistic Claims and Tone**: The author claims to be switching from Rust to C++ due to several reasons that are either exaggerated or not entirely credible. For example, the assertion that the C++ community is "much nicer and friendlier" and that the Rust community is "extremely imperious" is a stark and somewhat exaggerated contrast. The claim that the C++ subreddit is known for its sense of humor is also unusual, given the general perception of these communities.

2. **Technical Inaccuracies and Overgeneralizations**: The author makes several technical claims that are either overly simplistic or misleading. For instance, the idea that the dangers from memory safety problems are "overblown" and that a good programmer can avoid safety issues is a highly debatable point, especially in the context of complex systems like GUI toolkits. Additionally, the claim that C++ is evolving to become safer, while true to some extent, is presented in a way that downplays the significant safety guarantees provided by Rust.

3. **Community and Cultural Comments**: The author's comments about the Rust community's code of conduct and the C++ community's sense of humor are particularly out of place and seem designed to provoke a reaction. The statement that programming languages should be "free of politics" and focused strictly on technology is a common trope in tech discussions but is presented here in a way that seems deliberately provocative.

4. **Call to Action**: The invitation to join the Zulip instance for the C++ rewrite and the links to discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust are typical of a well-crafted April Fool's prank, designed to engage the community and see how many people fall for the joke.

Given these elements, the writing style and content strongly suggest that this is a satirical piece intended to be published on April 1st, a day known for pranks and hoaxes. The exaggerated and controversial nature of the claims, combined with the call to action, fits perfectly with the spirit of April Fool's Day. [end of text]
