The clerk likely advised the woman to cover the crystal ball when leaving her house due to superstitions or folklore surrounding such objects. Crystal balls have long been associated with the occult, divination, and the ability to attract or house spirits. Here are a few reasons why the clerk might have given this advice:

1. **Spiritual Protection**: It's a common belief that covering mirrors or reflective surfaces (like a crystal ball) can prevent spirits from using them as portals or from being trapped within them.

2. **Preventing Bad Luck**: Some people believe that leaving a crystal ball uncovered can invite bad luck or negative energy into the home.

3. **Maintaining Privacy**: The clerk might believe that a crystal ball could act as a window for psychics or entities to peer into the owner's personal life or future, so covering it would maintain privacy.

4. **Preservation**: Crystal balls are often thought to be sensitive to energy and light, so covering them could protect them from absorbing unwanted energies or from being exposed to sunlight, which might affect their clarity or power.

5. **Avoiding Disturbances**: The clerk might think that the crystal ball could attract unwanted attention from mischievous spirits or entities, potentially causing disturbances in the home.

6. **Respect for the Unknown**: The advice could also stem from a place of respect for the unknown powers or energies that the crystal ball might possess, advocating for caution in its handling.

In any case, the clerk's advice is rooted in the many myths and legends that attribute mystical properties to crystal balls, suggesting that the woman should treat the object with respect and caution to avoid any potential supernatural consequences. [end of text]
