Okay, let's try to figure out when this passage was written. So, the user provided a passage where someone is talking about moving from Rust to C++ for their projects, specifically the Linebender projects. They mention several points: build systems, safety, language evolution, and community.

First, I need to look for specific references to versions of Rust and C++ that might help date the passage. Let's start with the C++ versions mentioned. The author talks about C++20 bringing modules, which was finalized in 2020. Then they mention C++26, which is a future version. Wait, C++26 hasn't been released yet. The current standard is C++20, and C++23 is the latest as of 2023. So C++26 would be a future version, probably planned for around 2026. But the author is talking about it as something to look forward to, so the passage must have been written before C++26 is released. Since C++20 was released in December 2020, and C++23 in December 2023, C++26 is expected around 2026. So the passage was written after C++20 but before C++26, which is still in the future. So the date has to be after 2020.

Next, the Rust part. The author mentions that Rust's innovation has slowed down, with recent features like generic associated types (GATs) and "type alias impl trait" being more about combining existing features rather than new capabilities. Let me check when those features were stabilized. GATs were stabilized in Rust 1.60, which was released in May 2022. The "type alias impl trait" is part of the RFC process, maybe still in development. Wait, the passage says "the forthcoming 'type alias impl trait' is similar." So if GATs were stabilized in 2022, and the author is talking about recent features, maybe the passage is written after 2022.

Wait, but the author also mentions that Rust's pace of innovation has become more sedate, with async being a major effort. Async in Rust was stabilized around 2021, I think. So the author is comparing the past rapid innovation (like async) to the current slower pace. So the passage is probably written after Rust 1.50 or so, when async was stabilized, but after the GATs stabilization in 2022.

Wait, but the author says "recently landed features such as generic associated types have more of the flavor of making combinations of existing features work as expected rather than bringing any fundamentally new capabilities." So GATs were a recent feature, stabilized in 2022. So the passage must be written after May 2022.

Now, looking at the C++26 mention. The author says "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies." Let me check what's actually in C++26. Wait, C++26 is still a draft, so the features mentioned might be speculative. But the author is talking about them as upcoming. So the passage must be written before C++26 is released, which is expected around 2026, but the key is that the author is referring to C++26 as a future version, so the date has to be before 2026.

But we need a more precise date. Let's check other clues. The author mentions the C++ core guidelines. The C++ Core Guidelines were started by Bjarne Stroustrup and others, and they've been updated over time. The author says "the C++ core guidelines are useful, even if they’re honored in the breach." That's a common phrase, so maybe not a specific date, but the guidelines have been around since at least 2015, so that's not helpful.

Another point: the author mentions "the Linebender projects." I should check if Linebender is a real project. Wait, the user mentioned "Linebender projects" in the passage. Let me see if I can find any information about that. Maybe it's a fictional project, but maybe it's a real one. Wait, the passage says "We haven’t firmly decided on a build system for the Linebender projects yet, but most likely it will be CMake with plans to evaluate other systems and migrate, perhaps Meson." So Linebender is the name of the project they're working on.

Wait, I recall that there's a Rust GUI toolkit called Linebender. Let me check. A quick search in my mind: Linebender is a Rust-based GUI toolkit project. Wait, but the author is moving it to C++. So if Linebender is a real project, maybe the author is part of that project. Let me think. If Linebender is a Rust project, and the author is talking about rewriting it in C++, when was that happening?

Wait, but the passage is written from the perspective of someone who's been involved in Rust for many years, working on GUI toolkits. So Linebender might be a project they're associated with. Let me check if Linebender is a known project. Hmm. I think there's a project called Linebender that's a Rust GUI toolkit, but I'm not 100% sure. If that's the case, then the author is talking about moving that project to C++. But when was that announced?

Alternatively, maybe Linebender is a made-up name, but the key is the technical details. Let's focus on the language versions.

The author mentions C++20 modules. Modules were introduced in C++20, which was finalized in December 2020. So the author is talking about C++20 modules being implemented "fairly soon," so the passage must be written after C++20 was released, so after December 2020.

Then, C++26 is mentioned as a future version. The C++ standards are released every 3 years. C++20 was 2020, so C++23 was 2023, C++26 would be 2026. So the author is writing before 2026, which is obvious.

Now, looking at Rust. The author mentions that Rust's innovation has slowed, with recent features like GATs (Generic Associated Types) and "type alias impl trait." GATs were stabilized in Rust 1.60, which was released on May 26, 2022. So the passage must be written after May 2022.

The "type alias impl trait" is a feature that's been discussed in the Rust community. I think it's part of the RFC process, maybe still in development. The author says it's "forthcoming," so it's a feature that's planned but not yet stabilized. Let me check when "type alias impl trait" was stabilized. Wait, I think "type alias impl trait" (sometimes called "impl trait in type aliases") was stabilized in Rust 1.60 as well? Wait, no. Let me recall. The feature "impl trait in type aliases" was stabilized in Rust 1.60. Wait, but the author says "the forthcoming 'type alias impl trait' is similar." So if it's forthcoming, maybe it's not yet stabilized. Wait, but Rust 1.60 was in May 2022. If the author is saying it's forthcoming, maybe the passage was written before May 2022. Wait, but they mention GATs as a recently landed feature. So GATs were stabilized in May 2022, so the author is writing after that. If "type alias impl trait" is also a recent feature, maybe it was stabilized around the same time. Wait, but the author says "the forthcoming 'type alias impl trait' is similar," so it's a feature that's coming soon, not yet stabilized. So maybe the passage was written after GATs were stabilized (May 2022) but before "type alias impl trait" was stabilized. Wait, but I need to check when "type alias impl trait" was stabilized.

Wait, according to Rust's release notes, "impl trait in type aliases" was stabilized in Rust 1.60. So if GATs and "type alias impl trait" were both stabilized in 1.60, then the author is referring to them as recent features. So the passage would be written around the time of Rust 1.60, which is May 2022. But the author says "recently landed features such as generic associated types have more of the flavor of making combinations of existing features work as expected rather than bringing any fundamentally new capabilities; the forthcoming 'type alias impl trait' is similar." Wait, if "type alias impl trait" is forthcoming, but GATs are already landed, then the passage was written after GATs were stabilized (May 2022) but before "type alias impl trait" was stabilized. But if both were stabilized in 1.60, then the author might be referring to them as both recent. Wait, but the wording is "recently landed features such as generic associated types... the forthcoming 'type alias impl trait' is similar." So "forthcoming" suggests that "type alias impl trait" hasn't been stabilized yet, but GATs have. So maybe the passage was written after GATs were stabilized (May 2022) but before "type alias impl trait" was stabilized. Wait, but if both were in 1.60, then they were stabilized together. Let me confirm.

Looking up Rust 1.60: The release notes for Rust 1.60 (May 2022) mention that Generic Associated Types (GATs) were stabilized, and also "impl trait in type aliases" was stabilized. So both
