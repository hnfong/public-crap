This passage was likely written sometime between **late 2021 and early 2022**. Here's why:

* **C++20 and C++26:** The author mentions C++20 features being "implemented fairly soon" and anticipates C++26 features like stackful coroutines and safe range-based for loops. C++20 was finalized in 2020, and C++26 is expected around 2025. This timeframe suggests the writing occurred after C++20's release but before C++26's anticipated arrival.

* **Rust's Pace of Innovation:** The author criticizes Rust's "more sedate" pace of innovation, citing generic associated types and "type alias impl trait" as examples. These features were stabilized in Rust 1.51, released in August 2021.

* **Carbon Language:** The mention of the Carbon language, a C++-compatible language, is a clue. Carbon was announced in 2021 and gained significant attention in late 2021 and early 2022.

* **Social Commentary:** The author's comments about the Rust community being "imperious" and their desire for a "politics-free" programming language environment reflect sentiments that were prevalent in certain online discussions around that time.

* **"Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust":** This call to action suggests the author was targeting audiences familiar with these platforms, which were popular for tech discussions in the early 2020s.



While it's impossible to pinpoint the exact date, the combination of these clues strongly suggests the passage was written sometime between late 2021 and early 2022. [end of text]
