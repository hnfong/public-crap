The passage discusses the author's transition from Rust to C++ for the Linebender projects, highlighting the limitations of the Rust ecosystem, particularly the reliance on Cargo and the desire for more flexibility in build systems. It also touches on the evolution of both languages, mentioning C++20 and the potential of C++26, as well as the community dynamics of both Rust and C++.

To determine the date this passage was written, we can look at the language features and community trends mentioned:

1. **C++20 and C++26**: The passage mentions C++20 (which was standardized in 2020) and speculates on C++26 (which would be the next major version after C++23, expected around 2025). Since the passage is talking about the future (C++26), it's likely written before 2025.

2. **Rust's Edition System**: The passage notes that Rust's commitment to not breaking existing code through the edition system is holding it back. This is a known feature of Rust, but the specific mention of "type alias impl trait" and the edition system is consistent with Rust's development up to around 2021-2022.

3. **Community Dynamics**: The author comments on the Rust community being "imperious" and the C++ community being "nicer." This reflects the state of the communities at the time, which has evolved over the years, but the tone and specific references are consistent with the early to mid-2020s.

4. **C++ Features**: The passage mentions CMake, Meson, and other build systems, which are widely used and have been around for a long time. However, the author is considering a move to C++ for the Linebender projects, which suggests that the decision was made in the context of a growing interest in C++ for certain applications.

Considering all these factors, the passage is most likely written in **2022 or 2023**, as this is when the Rust community was still facing challenges with its ecosystem and the C++ community was evolving with new features and a more mature ecosystem. The author is likely looking to move to C++ for a more mature and flexible environment, which aligns with the timeline of the early 2020s. [end of text]
