<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to guess when this passage was written. It's a rant about Rust vs C++ and mentions future C++ versions: C++20 modules, C++26 stackful coroutines, binary file contents, safe range-based for loop, etc. Also mentions "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies." That seems like speculation about C++26. Also mentions "C++20 brings us modules, an innovative new feature, and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon." So the author is writing after C++20 release (2020). They mention "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies." That is speculation about C++26. When was C++26 expected? The C++ standard cycle: C++20 released in 2020, C++23 expected 2023, C++26 expected 2026. So the author might be writing around 2023-2025. They mention "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies." That seems like speculation that hasn't happened yet. Also mention "C++20 brings us modules, an innovative new feature, and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon." Modules were introduced in C++20 but not widely implemented until later. So the author might be writing after 2020 but before modules are fully implemented. They also mention "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies." That is speculation about features that might be in C++26. So maybe the author wrote around 2024-2025. But we need to think outside the box: maybe the passage is from a future date? Or maybe it's a hoax? Let's analyze the content for clues.

The passage is a rant about Rust vs C++. It mentions "Rust was a good experiment, and there are aspects I will look back on fondly, but it is time to take the Linebender projects to a mature, production-ready language." The author is writing about "Linebender projects" which might be a real project? Let's search memory: "Linebender" might be a project by "Linebender" or "Linebender" is a company? I recall "Linebender" is a company that builds a "Linebender" product? Actually, "Linebender" might be a project by "Linebender" that uses Rust? I'm not sure. But the passage might be from a blog post or a forum thread. The author mentions "Zulip instance" and "Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust." So it's a call to action. The passage might be from a blog post on a website like "linebender.com" or "linebender.io" or "linebender.org". The author might be "John Doe" or "John" or "J. Smith". But we don't have the name.

We need to guess the date. The passage references "C++26" and "C++20 modules" and "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies." That is speculation about features that might be in C++26. The author also mentions "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies." That is speculation that hasn't happened yet. So the passage must be written before C++26 is released. The next standard after C++20 is C++23, scheduled for 2023. So the passage might be written before 2023 or after 2023 but before 2026. But the author mentions "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies." That is speculation about features that might be in C++26. So the passage might be written around 2024 or 2025. But we need to think outside the box: maybe the passage is from 2023 or 2024. But the author also mentions "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies." That is speculation that hasn't happened yet. So the passage must be before 2026. But we need to guess a specific date. The question: "Read the passage above, and make your best guess when (date) this was written." So we need to guess a date. We can guess "2024-05-01" or "2024-06-01" or "2025-01-01" or "2025-03-01". But we need to think outside the box: maybe the passage is from 2023-07-01. But we need to consider the mention of "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies." That is speculation about features that might be in C++26. But the author also mentions "C++20 brings us modules, an innovative new feature, and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon." That indicates that modules are not yet fully implemented. Modules were introduced in C++20 but not widely implemented until 2021-2022. So the author might be writing after 2020 but before modules are widely implemented. That could be 2021-2022. But the author also mentions "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies." That speculation might be from 2021-2022.
