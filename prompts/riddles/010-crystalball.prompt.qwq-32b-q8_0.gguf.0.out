Okay, let's see. The user provided a short story where a woman buys a crystal ball from an antique shop. The clerk tells her to cover it when she leaves her house, and she asks, "Why? Spirits?" The question is why the clerk said that.

First, I need to think about the context of crystal balls in folklore or common beliefs. Crystal balls are often associated with fortune-telling or spiritual practices. In many stories or myths, crystal balls can act as portals or attract spirits, especially if left uncovered. 

The clerk's advice to cover the crystal ball probably relates to preventing unwanted spirits from entering or causing trouble. Maybe when the crystal ball is uncovered outdoors, it might attract spirits, which could be dangerous or bring bad luck. The clerk is warning her to cover it when outside the house to block such occurrences. 

Alternatively, maybe the clerk is referencing a specific tradition where leaving a crystal ball exposed allows spirits to enter the home. So covering it acts as a barrier. The key point is the connection between the crystal ball's exposure and the presence of spirits. The clerk's warning is to prevent spirits from being drawn to or entering through the crystal ball when it's outside. 

I should make sure there's no other common reason, like protecting the crystal from physical damage, but the mention of "spirits" in the story points to a supernatural reason. So the explanation should focus on the belief that uncovered crystal balls can attract or summon spirits when left outside.

The clerk likely warned the woman to cover the crystal ball when outside because, in folklore, uncovered crystal balls are believed to act as conduits or portals for spirits. Leaving it exposed might attract unwanted spirits, which could lead to supernatural interference or mischief. The clerkâ€™s advice serves as a precaution to prevent unintended spiritual encounters.
