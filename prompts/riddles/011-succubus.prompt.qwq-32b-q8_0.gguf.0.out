Okay, so the riddle is asking why most Warlocks in classic World of Warcraft are seen with Voidwalkers instead of Succubi, even though Succubi are usually better for leveling and questing. The hint says it's because of a skill that Succubi have which makes them more common than people think.

Hmm, let me think. I remember in Classic WoW, Warlocks have different demons they can summon. Voidwalkers, Succubi, Imps, and Felhounds. Each has their own abilities. The question is why players would choose Voidwalkers over Succubi despite the latter being better for quests and leveling. The key here is the Succubus's skill that's making them more common than perceived. Wait, but the riddle says Voidwalkers are more common, so maybe the Succubus's skill is something that actually makes them less commonly used, but the answer is that the skill is the reason they are actually more common? That part is a bit confusing.

Wait, the riddle states that Voidwalkers are more commonly seen, even though Succubi are better. The hint says the answer is a skill of the Succubus that makes them "more common than perceived." Maybe the skill is something that actually makes the Succubus more popular, but there's a catch. Let me think of the Succubus's abilities. The Succubus has Seduction, which is a CC (crowd control) ability that can put enemies to sleep. That's super useful for solo play and questing because you can CC one mob and attack another. But maybe the problem is that Seduction requires the Succubus to be out of combat to use it. So if you're in a group, other players might attack the mobs, breaking the Seduction, making it less effective. So in group situations, the Succubus's Seduction isn't as useful, so players might switch to Voidwalkers which have more tankiness and can take hits better. But the riddle is about why they are seen with Voidwalkers even though Succubi are better for leveling. Wait, leveling is usually solo, so maybe the issue is that the Succubus's Seduction is a good skill, but maybe the Succubus has another skill that's problematic?

Alternatively, maybe the Succubus's health is lower, making them more fragile. But the riddle's hint points to a specific skill. Let me think again. Oh! The Succubus's Seduction ability requires line of sight and can only be used when the Succubus is not in combat. So if you're in an area where you can't control when mobs attack, like in a busy zone or if you're not careful, the Succubus might get hit before you can cast Seduction, making it less reliable. But that's more about usage than a skill that makes them more common. Wait, the riddle says the answer is a skill that makes them (the Succubi) more common than perceived. Wait, maybe the answer is that the Succubus's Seduction is actually a popular choice, but the question is why Voidwalkers are more common. Wait, maybe the answer is that the Succubus's Seduction is a charm effect, and some mobs are immune to charm effects, so in those cases, the Succubus isn't as good, so players might prefer Voidwalkers. But the hint says the skill makes them more common than perceived. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the Succubus's skill is their ability to charm, but the problem is that the Succubus is a humanoid, so in some quests or situations where you need to fight demons, the Succubus would be considered a demon and thus might not be able to use Seduction on certain mobs. Wait, no, the target of Seduction is the enemy. Maybe the issue is that the Succubus's Seduction is a good skill, but the Succubus has lower health, so in dangerous situations, players might prefer the Voidwalker's durability. But the riddle's hint is pointing to a specific skill. Let me think again. Oh! The Succubus's "Seduction" is a charm, but the problem is that the Succubus can't attack while charmed. Wait, no, the Succubus can attack after using Seduction. Wait, maybe the key is that the Succubus's Seduction is a spell that requires the target to be within range and line of sight, but the main point is that the Succubus's "Seduction" is actually a very useful skill, so the reason players don't use them as much is because of another skill? Wait, maybe the answer is that the Succubus's "Seduction" is actually the reason they are more common than perceived. Wait, the riddle says Voidwalkers are more common, but the answer is that the Succubus's skill (Seduction) makes them more common than perceived. That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the answer is that the Succubus's "Seduction" is actually a popular choice, but the problem is that the Succubus is a humanoid, so in some quests or zones where you can't have a humanoid pet, like in certain instances, but that's not about leveling. Alternatively, maybe the Succubus's "Seduction" is a good skill, but the problem is that the Succubus's health is too low, so players might not use them in dangerous situations. But the riddle's hint says the skill makes them more common than perceived. Wait, perhaps the answer is that the Succubus's "Seduction" is actually a charm effect, and the problem is that the Succubus can't be used in certain situations where charm effects are resisted, but the actual reason they are not used is because of another skill. Wait, maybe the answer is that the Succubus's "Seduction" is actually the reason they are more common, but the riddle is a trick question. Wait, the riddle says "most warlocks are seen with voidwalkers even though the succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing". The hint says the answer is a skill of the succubus that makes them more common than perceived. Wait, maybe the answer is that the Succubus's "Seduction" is actually a very popular skill, so the Succubus is more common than people think, but in reality, players are seen with Voidwalkers because of another reason. Wait, maybe the answer is that the Succubus's "Seduction" requires the target to be humanoid, so in non-humanoid areas, they can't use it, making Voidwalkers better. But that's not exactly. Alternatively, maybe the Succubus's "Seduction" is a good skill, but the problem is that the Succubus's health is too low, so in group situations, they die quickly, so players prefer Voidwalkers. But the hint says the skill makes them more common than perceived. Wait, perhaps the answer is that the Succubus's "Seduction" is actually a very common skill, so the Succubus is more common than perceived, but the question is why Voidwalkers are more common. Wait, maybe the answer is that the Succubus's "Seduction" is actually the reason they are more common, but the riddle is a play on words. Wait, maybe the answer is that the Succubus's "Seduction" is a charm, and the problem is that the Succubus can't be used in certain zones where charm effects are resisted, but the actual reason is that the Succubus's "Seduction" is a good skill, so players do use them more, but they are not seen because they are stealthed? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the answer is that the Succubus's "Seduction" is actually a good skill, but the problem is that the Succubus's "Seduction" can only be used on humanoids, so in areas with non-humanoid mobs, the Succubus isn't as useful, so players switch to Voidwalkers. But the hint says the skill makes them more common than perceived. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the Succubus's "Seduction" is actually a very popular choice, so the Succubus is more common than people think, but the question is why Voidwalkers are more common. Wait, maybe the answer is that the Succubus's "Seduction" is a good skill, but the problem is that the Succubus's "Seduction" can be dispelled, so in PvP or against dispelling classes, it's not reliable, so players prefer Voidwalkers. But the riddle is about questing and leveling, not PvP. 

Wait, maybe the key is that the Succubus's "Seduction" is a charm, and the problem is that the Succubus is a humanoid, so in some quests or zones where you can't have a humanoid pet, but that's not about leveling. Alternatively, maybe the answer is that the Succubus's "Seduction" is actually the reason they are more common, but the riddle is a trick. Wait, the riddle says "the skill of the succubus that makes them more common than perceived". So the skill causes the Succubus to be more common than people think, but in reality, Voidwalkers are more common. Wait, maybe the answer is that the Succubus's "Seduction" is actually a very popular skill, so the Succubus is more common than perceived, but the question is why Voidwalkers are more common. Wait, maybe the answer is that the Succubus's "Seduction" is actually a good skill, but the problem is that the Succubus's "Seduction" can only be used on targets that are not in combat, so you have to approach mobs carefully, which is harder for new players, so they stick with Voidwalkers. But the hint says the skill makes them more common than perceived. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the actual game mechanics. In Classic WoW, the Succubus has Seduction, which is a charm. The Voidwalker has a shield and can tank better. The problem is that the Succubus's Seduction requires line of sight and can't be used if the Succubus is already in combat. So if you're in a situation where you can't control when the mobs attack (like in a busy area or if you're not careful), the Succubus might get hit before you can cast Seduction, making it less reliable.

</think>

The answer is **Seduction**. Succubi's Seduction charm requires line of sight and cannot be cast if already in combat, making it unreliable in chaotic situations. This limits their practical use despite their theoretical superiority, leading Warlocks to favor Voidwalkers' durability instead. [end of text]
