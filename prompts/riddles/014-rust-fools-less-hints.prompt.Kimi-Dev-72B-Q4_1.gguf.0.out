◁think▷Okay, let's try to figure out when this passage was written. The user mentioned several points about Rust and C++ that might give clues about the date.

First, looking at the language features discussed. The author mentions C++20 and looks forward to C++26. C++20 was standardized in 2020, and C++26 is a future version. So the passage was probably written after 2020. Also, they mention Rust's async features and generic associated types. Rust's async/await syntax was stabilized in Rust 1.39, which was released in October 2019. So the passage is likely after that.

Another point is the mention of the Carbon language, which is a proposed successor to C++. The Carbon project was announced in 2020, so that's another indicator of a post-2020 date.

The author also references Herb Sutter's cppfront proposal. Herb Sutter presented cppfront at CppCon 2020, so that's another clue pointing to after 2020.

Looking at the Rust community aspects mentioned, like the code of conduct and diversity policies. Rust's code of conduct has been in place for several years, but maybe the author's perception is from a more recent time.

Putting this together, the most likely date is around 2021 or 2022. Let me check some specific details. The author mentions C++26 potentially having stackful coroutines. C++23 is the next standard after C++20, but maybe they're referring to proposals for future versions. However, the exact date might be a bit tricky. Since the author is looking forward to C++26, which is a future version, perhaps the passage was written in 2021 when C++20 was already out, and C++23 was in the works.

Another angle: the author mentions that Rust's pace of innovation has become more sedate. Rust 1.0 was released in 2015, and async features came in 2019. After that, maybe the author is writing this in a period where Rust's new features are not as groundbreaking. So perhaps 2021 or 2022.

Wait, the author also mentions "type alias impl trait" as a forthcoming feature in Rust. That feature was stabilized in Rust 1.63, which was released in July 2022. So the passage must have been written after that, or at least when that feature was on the horizon. But if the author is talking about features that are already landed, maybe the date is around 2022.

But the user wants the best guess. Let me think: the author is planning a rewrite from Rust to C++, and mentions C++20 features. The earliest possible date would be after C++20 was released, which is late 2020. But maybe the passage was written in 2021 or 2022.

Another clue: the author mentions the Linebender projects. Linebender is a project related to Rust GUI toolkits. If the author is moving away from Rust, perhaps this is a hypothetical scenario. But assuming it's a real scenario, maybe the date is when such a move would make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the passage is a mock or a satire. But the user is asking for the best guess based on the content.

Putting all together, the most likely date is around 2021 or 2022. Let me pick a specific date. Since the author mentions C++20 and looks forward to C++26, and considering the Rust features mentioned, perhaps the passage was written in 2021. Let's say, mid-2021. But to be safe, maybe 2022. Wait, the "type alias impl trait" was added in Rust 1.63 (July 2022), so if the author is referring to that as a forthcoming feature, maybe the passage was written before July 2022. But if they mention it as already landed, then after. The passage says "recently landed features such as generic associated types have more of the flavor..." and "the forthcoming 'type alias impl trait' is similar." So maybe the author is writing this in a time when "type alias impl trait" is not yet released but is expected. So perhaps the passage was written in 2021, before Rust 1.63.

But Rust's release schedule is every 6 months. Rust 1.63 was released in July 2022. So if the author is talking about "forthcoming" features, maybe the passage is from early 2022. But the exact date is hard to pinpoint. However, given the context, the best guess would be around 2021-2022.

Another angle: the author mentions the C++ community's friendliness and the Rust community's imperiousness. This might be a reflection of community dynamics at a certain time. But that's more subjective.

In conclusion, the most probable date for this passage is around 2021 or 2022. Let's pick a date in 2021, say, October 2021, when C++20 is established, and Rust's async features are a few years old. But since the user wants a specific date, perhaps the best guess is 2021-10-01. Alternatively, maybe 2022-05-01. But without more precise information, it's a bit of a guess. However, based on the features mentioned, I'll go with 2021.
◁/think▷

The passage was likely written in **2021**. Key indicators include:

1. **C++20** is mentioned as a current standard, which was finalized in December 2020.
2. The author looks forward to **C++26**, indicating the passage was written after C++20's adoption.
3. References to **Rust's async features** which were stabilized in Rust 1.39 (October 2019), suggesting the passage is from 2020 or later.
4. Mention of **generic associated types** in Rust, which were introduced in Rust 1.45 (June 2020).
5. The **Carbon language** proposal, which gained traction in 2020.
6. Discussion of **Herb Sutter's cppfront** proposal, which was presented in 2020.

These points converge around 2021 as the most probable year for the passage's composition. [end of text]
