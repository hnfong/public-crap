It sounds like Bob's description of his meal is a bit unconventional and possibly misleading. Let's break down what he said:

- **Aged organic milk**: This could be yogurt or kefir, which are fermented dairy products and can be considered healthy if they are part of a balanced diet.
- **Tossed over seasoned tomato purée**: This suggests a sauce or dressing made from tomatoes, which can be healthy if it's not too high in added sugars or sodium.
- **Spread on baked whole wheat**: This likely refers to a whole wheat bread or cracker, which is generally a healthier choice compared to refined grains.

However, the way Bob described it is quite unusual and might be a playful or exaggerated way of describing a dish. When Alice saw the photo, she was likely surprised or confused by what she saw, which led to her reaction of "wtf."

### What Bob Probably Ate:
- **Yogurt or kefir** (aged organic milk) mixed with a **tomato sauce** and spread on **whole wheat bread** or a cracker.

### Was It Healthy?
- **Yogurt or kefir**: These are generally healthy, providing probiotics, protein, and calcium.
- **Tomato purée**: Tomatoes are rich in vitamins and antioxidants, and a seasoned purée can be healthy if not overly processed.
- **Whole wheat bread**: Whole grains are a good source of fiber and nutrients.

If the ingredients are of good quality and the preparation is not overly processed or high in unhealthy additives, the meal could be considered healthy. However, the unusual combination and Bob's playful description might have led to Alice's confusion and surprise.

In summary, Bob likely ate a dish that could be healthy, but the way he described it was so unconventional that it caught Alice off guard. [end of text]
