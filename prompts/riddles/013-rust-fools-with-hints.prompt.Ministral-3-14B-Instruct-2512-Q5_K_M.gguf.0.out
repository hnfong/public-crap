The passage was likely written around **April 1st**, specifically in **2023**.

### Key Clues Supporting This Guess:

1. **Distinctive Writing Style and Tone**:
   The passage has a satirical, exaggerated, and slightly absurd tone, particularly in its critique of Rust and praise for C++. This style is highly reminiscent of an **April Fools' joke**—a tradition where people publish humorous or fake news to trick others. The author's claims (e.g., "the Rust community is extremely imperious" or "C++ has a new syntax called cppfront") are over-the-top and unlikely to be sincere, especially given the context of a developer who has been deeply involved in Rust for years.

2. **Specific References to C++ Features**:
   The passage mentions **C++26** (which was still speculative at the time of writing) and **cppfront** (a proposed syntax for C++ by Herb Sutter, which was still in early discussion stages). These details suggest the text was written in **2023**, as C++26 was not yet finalized, and the tone implies the author is jokingly hyping up future C++ features as if they were already a reality.

3. **Mention of "Linebender Projects"**:
   The "Linebender" projects are real Rust-based GUI toolkits (e.g., [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit), [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu), and [ash](https://github.com/ash-rs/ash)), but the idea of rewriting them in C++ is absurd—especially given the author's long history with Rust. This further supports the idea that the passage is a joke.

4. **Hacker News and Reddit References**:
   The call to "Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust" is a classic April Fools' move, as it invites readers to engage with the joke and spread it further.

5. **Timing of Rust and C++ Developments**:
   - Rust's **edition system** and **generic associated types** were already stable by 2023, but the passage critiques Rust's slow pace of innovation, which aligns with the frustration some developers felt at the time.
   - C++20 was already released (2020), and C++23 was finalized in 2022, leaving C++26 as the next major version being discussed in 2023.
   - The mention of **Carbon** (a new language inspired by C++ being developed by Google) was still in early stages in 2023, making it a plausible (but fake) topic for an April Fools' joke.

### Why April 1st?
The exaggerated, satirical tone, combined with the absurd premise of abandoning Rust for C++ (despite the author's long involvement in Rust), strongly suggests this was written as an **April Fools' joke**. The date **April 1st, 2023**, fits because:
- It was a time when C++26 and Carbon were still speculative but actively discussed.
- The Rust community was known for its strong opinions and occasional humor (e.g., past April Fools' pranks).
- The author's name (if real) could be tied to a known Rust developer who might have played along with the joke.

### Conclusion:
This passage is almost certainly an **April Fools' joke from 2023**, likely posted on April 1st. The exaggerated claims, satirical tone, and references to then-future C++ features all point to it being a humorous prank rather than a serious announcement. [end of text]
