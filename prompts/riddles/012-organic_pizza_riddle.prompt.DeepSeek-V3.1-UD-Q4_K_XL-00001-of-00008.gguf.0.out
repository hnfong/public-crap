Let's break down Bob's description:

- "aged organic milk" – This is likely cheese. Cheese is made from aged milk, and if it's organic, it implies it comes from organically raised animals.
- "seasoned tomato purée" – This sounds like tomato sauce or marinara sauce that has been seasoned with herbs and spices.
- "spread on baked whole wheat" – This suggests that the tomato purée is spread on something made from baked whole wheat, which could be whole wheat bread or a cracker.

Putting it all together, Bob is describing a pizza. Here's how:
- The "aged organic milk" (cheese) is "tossed over" the "seasoned tomato purée" (tomato sauce), which is spread on "baked whole wheat" (whole wheat crust).

So, Bob ate a pizza made with organic cheese, seasoned tomato sauce, and a whole wheat crust.

Now, was it healthy?
- Pizza can be part of a balanced diet, but it often has high calories, sodium, and fat depending on the toppings and portion size.
- In this case, Bob used organic ingredients and whole wheat crust, which are healthier choices (whole wheat provides more fiber, organic might reduce exposure to pesticides and antibiotics).
- However, cheese is high in saturated fat and sodium, and tomato sauce can also be high in sodium. The overall healthiness depends on the amount of cheese and sauce used, as well as the portion size.
- If Bob ate a reasonable portion with moderate cheese and low-sodium sauce, it could be relatively healthy. But if it was a large pizza with excessive cheese, it might not be.

Alice's reaction ("wtf") might be because she initially thought Bob was eating something like a salad or a straightforward healthy meal, but instead he sent a photo of pizza, which is often considered more of a treat or junk food. However, with the ingredients described, it could be a healthier version of pizza.

In summary: Bob ate a pizza with organic cheese, seasoned tomato sauce, and whole wheat crust. It could be considered moderately healthy if made with mindful portions and ingredients, but it's not typically what people think of when they hear "eating healthy" (which often implies salads, lean proteins, etc.). Alice was probably surprised because she expected something else. [end of text]
