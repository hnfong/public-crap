Okay, let's try to figure out when this passage was written. The user mentioned that the writing style is connected to a specific day and month of the year. Hmm, the passage is about the author's transition from Rust to C++ for their projects, discussing build systems, safety, language evolution, and community. The key here is to find clues in the text that might hint at the date.

First, I'll look for any mentions of specific dates or events. The author talks about C++20 and C++26. Wait, C++20 was released in December 2020, and C++26 is not yet released. But the passage says "C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines..." So if the author is talking about C++26 as a future version, that might mean the passage was written before C++26 was released. But C++26 is not a real version yet. Wait, C++23 was released in 2022, C++24 in 2023, and C++26 would be in 2026? But that's a bit far. Alternatively, maybe the author is referring to the next version after C++20, which is C++23, but the text says C++26. Maybe the author is using a hypothetical or a future version, but that's not helpful.

Wait, the user said the writing style is connected to a particular day and month. Maybe the date is related to the release of a specific version of C++ or a notable event in the Rust or C++ community. Let me think about the C++20 release date. C++20 was officially released in December 2020. The author mentions C++20 and C++26. If the passage was written after C++20 was released, but before C++26, then the date would be between 2020 and 2026. But the author is talking about C++26 as a future version, so maybe the passage was written in 2022 or 2023, when C++23 was released, but the author is still talking about C++26 as a future version.

Alternatively, maybe the date is related to the release of a specific version of Rust. The author mentions that Rust's innovation has slowed down, and that the edition mechanism is holding it back. Rust's versioning is different, but maybe the author is referring to a specific date when the Rust community was more active in certain ways.

Wait, the passage also mentions the C++ subreddit's sense of humor. The C++ subreddit is known for being more humorous and less confrontational compared to the Rust community. The author is comparing the two communities, saying the Rust community is "extremely imperious" and demanding projects be rewritten in Rust. That might be a reference to a specific event or time when the Rust community was more vocal or had certain policies.

Another clue is the mention of "type alias impl trait" as a forthcoming feature. I need to check when that feature was introduced in Rust. "Type alias impl trait" is a feature that was introduced in Rust 1.60, which was released in May 2020. So if the author is talking about it as a forthcoming feature, maybe the passage was written before that date. But the author says "the forthcoming 'type alias impl trait' is similar," which suggests that the feature was not yet released when the passage was written. So if the passage was written in May 2020, that would make sense. But the author is also talking about C++20, which was released in 2020. So maybe the passage was written around the time of C++20's release, which is December 2020. But the author is also talking about the Rust community's issues, which might have been more prominent around that time.

Wait, the author mentions that the Rust community is "extremely imperious, constantly demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust, and denigrating all other programming languages." That might be a reference to the Rust community's behavior around the time of the release of Rust 1.0 in 2015, but that's too early. Alternatively, maybe the author is referring to the time when the Rust community was more active in promoting their language, perhaps around the time of the release of Rust 1.0, but that's not directly helpful.

Alternatively, the date might be related to the release of the C++ core guidelines. The C++ core guidelines were first published in 2017 by Bjarne Stroustrup. But the author mentions that the C++ core guidelines are useful even if they're honored in the breach. If the passage was written after that, maybe around 2017 or later.

Wait, the author also mentions the C++ subreddit's sense of humor. The C++ subreddit is known for being more humorous and less confrontational. But when was that a notable point? Maybe around the time of the C++20 release, which was in 2020. But the author is talking about the C++ community being friendlier, which might be a more recent observation.

Alternatively, the writing style might be connected to a specific date. The passage is written in a way that's similar to a blog post or article that was published on a particular day. For example, the author might be referencing a specific date when the Rust community was particularly active or when a certain event happened.

Wait, the user said the writing style is connected to one particular day and month. Maybe the date is December 2020, which is when C++20 was released. The author mentions C++20 and C++26, but if the passage was written in December 2020, that would make sense because C++20 was just released, and the author is talking about future versions. But the author is also talking about the Rust community's issues, which might have been more prominent around that time.

Alternatively, maybe the date is related to the release of the Rust 1.0 version, which was in 2015. But that's too early. The author is talking about the Rust community being "extremely imperious," which might be a more recent phenomenon.

Wait, the author mentions "the Rust community is also known for its code of conduct and other policies promoting diversity." That's a reference to the Rust community's code of conduct, which was established in 2016. So if the passage was written after that, maybe around 2016 or later. But the author is also talking about the C++ community being friendlier, which might be a more recent observation.

Alternatively, the date could be related to the release of the C++ core guidelines. The C++ core guidelines were first published in 2017, but the author says "even if theyâ€™re honored in the breach," which might be a reference to the guidelines being more established by then.

Wait, the author is talking about the C++ community's leadership, specifically Stroustrup's paper on safety. Stroustrup is the creator of C++. He wrote a paper on safety in C++ in 2017, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the date is related to the release of the C++20 standard, which was December 2020. The author mentions that C++20 brings modules, which were introduced in C++20. So if the passage was written in December 2020, that would make sense because the author is talking about C++20 features.

But the author is also talking about the Rust community's issues, which might have been more prominent around that time. Also, the author is looking to move to a mature language, which could be a reason to write the article around the time of C++20's release, as it's a more mature language.

Alternatively, the date could be related to the release of the C++23 standard, which was in 2023. But the author mentions C++26 as a future version, which would be in 2026. If the passage was written in 2023, that would make sense. But the author is also talking about the Rust community's issues, which might have been more prominent in 2020.

Wait, the user said the writing style is connected to a specific day and month. Maybe the date is December 2020, which is when C++20 was released. The author mentions C++20 and C++26, but if the passage was written in December 2020, that would be the time when C++20 was just released, and the author is talking about future versions. Also, the author is comparing the Rust community's behavior, which might have been more active around that time.

Alternatively, maybe the date is related to the release of the C++ core guidelines. The C++ core guidelines were first published in 2017, but the author is talking about them being useful even if not fully followed. If the passage was written in 2017, that would make sense. But the author is also talking about the Rust community's issues, which might have been more prominent in 2020.

Wait, the author mentions "the forthcoming 'type alias impl trait' is similar." That feature was introduced in Rust 1.60, which was released in May 2020. So if the passage was written in May 2020, that would be when the feature was just released. But the author is talking about the Rust community being "extremely imperious," which might be a more recent observation.

Alternatively, the date could be related to the release of the C++20 standard. Since the author is talking about C++20 features, and the passage was written after that, but before C++26. If the passage was written in December 2020, that's when C++20 was officially released. The author is talking about the C++ community being more friendly, which might be a point made around that time.

But the user said the writing style is connected to a particular day and month. Maybe the date is December 2020, which is the release date of C++20. The author is comparing the Rust ecosystem's build system issues, which might have been more prominent around that time. Also, the author is talking about the C++ community being friendlier, which could be a point made after the release of C++20.

Alternatively, maybe the date is related to the release of the Rust 1.0 version, which was in 2015. But that's too early. The author is talking about the Rust community being "extremely imperious," which might be a more recent phenomenon.

Wait, the author mentions "the Rust community is also known for its code of conduct and other policies promoting diversity." That's a reference to the Rust community's code of conduct, which was established in 2016. So if the passage was written in 2016, that would be when the code of conduct was first introduced. But the author is also talking about the Rust ecosystem's build system issues, which might have been more prominent in 2020.

Alternatively, the date could be related to the release of the C++20 standard, which was December 2020. The author is talking about C++20 features, and the C++ community's leadership. So maybe the passage was written in December 2020, which is the release date of C++20. That would make sense because the author is discussing the features of C++20 and the future of C++26, which is a hypothetical future version.

But the user said the writing style is connected to a specific day and month. The passage is written in a way that's similar to a blog post that was published on a particular day. For example, the author might be referencing a specific date when the Rust community was particularly active or when a certain event happened.

Wait, the author is talking about the C++ community being friendlier, which might be a reference to the C++ subreddit's sense of humor. The C++ subreddit is known for being more humorous, but when was that a notable point? Maybe around the time of the C++20 release, which was December 2020. So the passage was written in December 2020.

Alternatively, the date could be related to the release of the C++ core guidelines. The C++ core guidelines were first published in 2017, but the author is talking about them being useful even if not fully followed. If the passage was written in 2017, that would make sense. But the author is also talking about the Rust community's issues, which might have been more prominent in 2020.

Another angle: the author is comparing the Rust and C++ communities. The Rust community's code of conduct was established in 2016, but the author is talking about the Rust community being "extremely imperious," which might be a more recent observation. If the passage was written in 2020, that would be after the code of conduct was established, but maybe the author is referring to a different aspect.

Wait, the author mentions "the Rust community is also known for its code of conduct and other policies promoting diversity." That's a fact, but the author is also saying that they think the Rust community is too political. Maybe the date is when the Rust community was more vocal about their policies, which could be around 2020.

But the key is the writing style. The passage is written in a way that's similar to a blog post that was published on a specific day. The user says the writing style is connected to one particular day and month. Maybe the date is December 2020, which is the release date of C++20. The author is talking about C++20 features, which were just released, and the C++ community's leadership. That seems like a plausible date.

Alternatively, the date could be related to the release of the C++23 standard, which was in 2023. But the author is talking about C++26 as a future version, which would be in 2026. If the passage was written in 2023, that would make sense. But the author is also talking about the Rust community's issues, which might have been more prominent in 2020.

Wait, the author is talking about the Rust community being "extremely imperious," which might be a reference to the time when the Rust community was more active in pushing for certain changes, perhaps around the time of the release of Rust 1.0 in 2015, but that's too early. Alternatively, maybe the author is referring to the time when the Rust community was more vocal about their code of conduct, which was in 2016.

But the user says the writing style is connected to a specific day and month. Maybe the date is December 2020, which is when C++20 was released. The author is talking about C++20 features, which were just released, and the C++ community's leadership. That seems like a strong candidate.

Alternatively, the date could be related to the release of the C++20 standard, which was December 2020. The author is discussing the C++20 features, which were just released, and the C++ community's friendliness. So the passage was written around that time.

Another thought: the author mentions "the C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor." The C++ subreddit is known for being more humorous, but when was that a notable point? Maybe around the time of the C++20 release, which was December 2020. That's when the C++ community was more active in discussing new features, and the subreddit might have been more active in that period.

So putting it all together, the passage was likely written in December 2020, the release date of C++20. The author is talking about C++20 features and the C++ community's friendliness, which aligns with that date. The mention of C++26 as a future version would be plausible if the passage was written in 2020, as the C++26 standard is not yet released. The author is also comparing the Rust community's issues, which might have been more prominent around that time.

Therefore, the best guess is December 2020.
</think>

The passage was most likely written on **December 2020**. Here's how the hint connects to this date:

1. **C++20 Release Date**: The author explicitly mentions C++20 features like modules, which were officially released in **December 2020**. This aligns with the passage's focus on C++20 as a "notable characteristic" of C++'s rapid evolution. The reference to C++26 as a "likely" future version (even though it hasn't been released yet) suggests the author is writing in the context of C++20's recent adoption, making December 2020 a plausible time frame.

2. **Rust Community Critique**: The author's frustration with Rust's "near-monoculture" of Cargo and the Rust community's "imperious" nature is a recurring theme in discussions about Rust's growth. This critique gained traction around 2020, especially as Rust's ecosystem matured and its community became more vocal about its policies and practices. The mention of the Rust community's code of conduct (established in 2016) but the author's current dissatisfaction with its "political" tone fits a timeline where the Rust community was increasingly scrutinized for its behavior.

3. **C++ Subreddit Humor**: The author notes the C++ subreddit's "sense of humor," which is a well-known trait of the C++ community. This observation is likely made in the context of the C++20 release, as the subreddit became more active in discussing new features and community dynamics around that time.

4. **Rust's Edition Mechanism**: The author criticizes Rust's "commitment to not break existing code" due to its edition system, which was introduced in 2015 but became more prominent in the 2020s. The passage's tone of frustration with Rust's slower innovation pace (compared to C++20) reflects a period where Rust's ecosystem was being compared to C++'s rapid progress, a trend that accelerated in 2020.

**Conclusion**: The writing style and content of the passage are most consistent with **December 2020**, the release date of the C++20 standard. The author is likely reflecting on the C++20 release, the Rust community's evolving dynamics, and the broader context of programming language trends around that time. The mention of C++26 as a future version (even if hypothetical) and the Rust community's "imperious" behavior align with the timeline of 2020, when C++20 was a major milestone and Rust's community was under increased scrutiny for its policies.
