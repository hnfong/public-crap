The passage is written in a style that is both reflective and critical of the Rust language, with a clear tone of nostalgia and a desire to move away from Rust for more mature, stable systems like C++. The author expresses frustration with the "near-monoculture" of the Rust ecosystem, particularly the reliance on Cargo as the sole build system, and contrasts this with the diverse build systems available in C++.

The key hint here is the **distinctive writing style** of the article, which is **connected to one particular day and month of the year**. The author uses phrases like "Iâ€™ve been involved in Rust and the Rust community for many years now" and "I look forward to productive collaboration with others in the C++ community," which suggest a **long-term perspective** and a **sense of urgency** to move the Linebender projects to a "mature, production-ready language."

The **distinctive writing style** also includes **technical jargon** and **a deep understanding of both Rust and C++**, which suggests that the author is **well-versed in both languages** and has a **personal connection** to both. This is a strong indicator that the author is **not a newcomer** to the Rust community, but rather someone who has been involved for many years.

The **tone** of the passage is **critical** and **reflective**, with a **clear preference for C++** and a **strong desire to move away from Rust**. This suggests that the author is **writing from a time when Rust was still relatively new** and not yet established as a mainstream, mature language.

### Key clues:
- The author mentions "C++20" and "C++26," which are future versions of C++.
- The author refers to "the C++ community" and "the C++ subreddit," which are **current** and **real**.
- The author uses **technical terms** and **deep knowledge** of both Rust and C++.
- The author expresses **long-term commitment** to the C++ community and a **desire to move projects to a more mature language**.

### Conclusion:
The **distinctive writing style** and the **long-term perspective** of the author suggest that the passage was written **around 2018**, when Rust was still in its early stages and the C++ community was more established and diverse.

### Final Answer:
**April 2018**

### Explanation:
The author's **long-term perspective** and **technical depth** suggest that the passage was written **around 2018**, when Rust was still relatively new and the C++ community was more established. The **distinctive writing style** and **critical tone** also align with a time when the author was actively involved in the Rust community and was still forming opinions about its future.
