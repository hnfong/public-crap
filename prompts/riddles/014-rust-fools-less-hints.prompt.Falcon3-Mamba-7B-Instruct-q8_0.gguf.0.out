Based on the content provided, the passage seems to reflect a perspective that is somewhat nostalgic for C++ and critical of Rust, particularly regarding its ecosystem and safety guarantees. The mention of "C++20" and "C++26" suggests that the author is aware of recent developments in C++, which were not yet fully realized at the time of writing.

The reference to "C++20" and "C++26" indicates that the author is familiar with the C++ standards process, which typically involves several years of development and standardization. As of my knowledge cutoff in 2023, C++20 was finalized and published in 2020, and C++26 was still in the works, with a tentative standardization timeline.

Given this context, the passage likely was written after 2020, when C++20 was finalized, and before 2023, when C++26 was expected to be published. Considering the discussion of "C++26" and the mention of "C++20," it's reasonable to infer that the passage was written sometime in 2021 or 2022.

Therefore, a plausible date for when this passage was written is **2021**. This period would align with the timeline of C++ development, where C++20 was finalized and C++26 was in the planning stages. [end of text]
