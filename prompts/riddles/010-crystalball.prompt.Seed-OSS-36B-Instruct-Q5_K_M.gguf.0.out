Got it, let's try to figure this out. The story is about a woman buying a crystal ball from an antique shop. The clerk tells her to cover it when she leaves the house, and she asks if it's because of spirits. We need to explain why the clerk said that.

First, crystal balls are often associated with spirituality or magic, but maybe there's a more practical reason here. The clerk's warning is about covering it when leaving the house, so maybe it's not about spirits but something physical. What's a common issue with crystal balls? They're usually made of glass, right? Glass can scratch, get dirty, or maybe break if it's not covered. But why would the clerk specifically mention covering it when leaving the house? Maybe it's about sunlight? Some materials, especially if they're not just regular glass, might fade or get damaged by UV light. Or maybe it's a practical anti-theft thing? But the lady asks about spirits, so the clerk's reason is probably not theft.

Wait, another angle: "cover it when you leave your house"—maybe "leave your house" implies being outside, so exposure to the elements? Like rain, snow, dust? But crystal balls are often displayed in shops, maybe they're sensitive to temperature or moisture? Or maybe it's a play on words? "Cover" could mean more than just a physical cover. But the most likely practical reason is that crystal balls (especially antique ones) might be fragile or sensitive to light. Alternatively, maybe the clerk is joking about the spiritual aspect, but the question says "why did the clerk say this"—probably a practical reason, not spirits. Because the lady assumes spirits, but the clerk's reason is different.

Wait, another thought: antique crystal balls might be made with leaded glass, which is softer and more prone to scratching. If you leave it uncovered outside, dust or debris could scratch it. Or maybe they're valuable, so covering it to prevent theft? But the clerk says "when you leave your house," so maybe when she's carrying it outside? Like, if she's taking it home, she should cover it to protect it from damage, not spirits. That makes sense. The lady jumps to spirits, but the real reason is to protect the crystal ball from physical damage—like scratches, dirt, sunlight, etc. Yeah, that's probably it. Antique items, especially delicate ones like crystal balls, need protection from the elements or accidental damage when being transported outside the shop. So the clerk is warning her to cover it to keep it safe, not because of spirits.</seed:think>The clerk likely advised covering the crystal ball to protect it from physical damage, not spirits.
