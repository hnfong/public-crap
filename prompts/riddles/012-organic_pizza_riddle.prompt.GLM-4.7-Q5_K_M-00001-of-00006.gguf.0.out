Here is what happened:

**What Bob ate:**
Bob ate **pizza**.

He used overly pretentious and technical language to describe a standard slice of pizza:
*   "Aged organic milk" = Cheese.
*   "Seasoned tomato purée" = Pizza sauce.
*   "Baked whole wheat" = The pizza crust (dough).

**Was it healthy?**
**Likely no.**

While Bob used "healthy buzzwords" like *organic*, *whole wheat*, and *tomato*, the core of the meal is still likely high in refined carbohydrates, grease, and saturated fats. Alice’s reaction ("wtf") implies that the photo showed a greasy, standard slice of pizza that clearly contradicted the image of a "healthy" meal Bob was trying to paint with his words.
