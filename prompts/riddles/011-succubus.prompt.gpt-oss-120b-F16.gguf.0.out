<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer: In classic WoW, why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though succubus is usually better for leveling and questing? Hint: it's because a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived.

We need to answer concisely. So the answer: Because the Succubus's "Seduction" ability is a crowd control that is used often, but also because the Succubus is a pet that can be dismissed and resummoned? Wait.

The question: "In classic wow, why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though the succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing? Hint: it's because a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived."

So the answer: Because the Succubus's "Seduction" ability is a crowd control that is used to control enemies, making them more common? Hmm.

But the question: "why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though the succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing?" So the answer: Because the Voidwalker is the only pet that can tank, and many warlocks use them for tanking while questing? But the hint says: it's because a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived.

Maybe the succubus's "Seduction" is a crowd control that is used to control enemy players in PvP, making them more common? Wait.

But the question: "most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing." So why? Because the Voidwalker is the only pet that can tank and thus is used for solo questing? But succubus is better for leveling due to its "Searing Pain"? Actually succubus has "Searing Pain"? No, succubus has "Searing Pain"? Wait.

Warlock pets: Imp (damage), Voidwalker (tank), Succubus (crowd control and damage). For leveling, many warlocks use Imp for damage, but succubus is better for questing because of "Seduction" to crowd control? Actually succubus's Seduction is a CC that can incapacitate a target for 30 seconds, which is useful for questing to control mobs. But the hint says: "it's because a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived." So succubus's skill "Seduction" is a crowd control that is used often, making them more common? Wait.

But the question: "why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing?" So maybe because the Voidwalker is the only pet that can tank, and many warlocks use them for questing because they can tank multiple mobs while you cast spells. But succubus is better for leveling due to Seduction? Hmm.

But the hint: "it's because a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived." So maybe succubus's "Seduction" is a crowd control that can be used to "stealth" or "invisibility"? Wait.

Actually succubus has "Seduction" which is a charm that can be used to charm enemy players in PvP, but also can be used to charm NPCs? No, you cannot charm NPCs. So it's not for questing. So succubus is not better for questing? Wait.

Maybe the succubus's "Siphon Life" or "Drain Life"? No.

Let's recall: Warlock pets: Imp (damage, Firebolt, Blood Pact), Voidwalker (tank, Torment, Suffering), Succubus (CC: Seduction, damage: Lash of Pain, Whiplash). The succubus's Seduction is a charm that works on humanoid enemies (players, NPCs). It can be used to charm enemy players in PvP, but not NPCs. So succubus is not better for questing because Seduction doesn't work on mobs. So maybe the hint is about "Seduction" being used for PvP, making succubus more common in PvP than perceived. But the question is about leveling and questing, not PvP. Hmm.

Maybe the hint: "it's because a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived." Could be that succubus's "Seduction" is used to crowd control enemy players in battlegrounds, making them more common in PvP. But the question: "In classic wow, why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though the succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing?" So answer: Because succubus is more common due to its Seduction ability being used in PvP, so many warlocks have succubus for PvP, but for leveling they use voidwalkers? Wait.

Let's parse: The riddle: "In classic wow, why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though the succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing? Hint: it's because a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived."

So the answer: Because succubus's Seduction is a crowd control that is used in PvP, making succubus more common (players see them more often) but not necessarily for leveling. Actually the riddle says "most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing." So why are they seen with voidwalkers? Because succubus is more common due to Seduction? Wait.

Maybe the answer: Because succubus is more common due to its Seduction ability being used in PvP, so many warlocks have succubus for PvP, but when you see warlocks in the world (questing zones) they often have voidwalkers because they are tanking? Hmm.

Let's think: The riddle might be about "most warlocks seen with voidwalkers" meaning when you see warlocks in the world, they have voidwalkers. But succubus is better for leveling, but you don't see them because succubus is used for PvP and not for questing? Actually succubus is better for leveling because of its "Searing Pain"? Wait.

Let's recall: In Classic, the succubus's "Searing Pain" is not a thing. The succubus's damage spells are "Lash of Pain" (damage) and "Whiplash" (AoE). The voidwalker has "Torment" (damage) and "Suffering" (AoE). The imp has "Firebolt" and "Blood Pact". For leveling, many warlocks use the imp because it's cheap and deals damage. But succubus is better for questing because of "Seduction" to crowd control? Actually you can use Seduction on humanoid mobs (like quest givers) to charm them? No, you cannot charm NPCs. So succubus is not better for questing. So maybe the succubus is better for leveling because of its "Searing Pain"? I'm not sure.

Let's search memory: In Classic, succubus's "Searing Pain" is not a skill. The succubus's "Searing Pain" is a warlock spell, not pet. The succubus's "Searing Pain" is a warlock spell that deals damage. But succubus's "Searing Pain" is not a pet ability. So succubus's "Seduction" is the only unique ability.

Maybe the riddle's answer: Because succubus's Seduction is a crowd control that is used in PvP, making succubus more common (players see them more often) but not for questing. So warlocks are seen with voidwalkers because they are questing, while succubus warlocks are more common in PvP. So the answer: Because succubus's Seduction is used for crowd control in PvP, making succubus warlocks more common in battlegrounds, but when you see warlocks in the world they are questing with voidwalkers.

Thus answer: Because succubus's Seduction is a crowd control that is used in PvP, making succubus warlocks more common in PvP, but voidwalkers are used for questing due to tanking ability. So the answer: Because succubus's Seduction is a crowd control that is used for PvP, making succubus warlocks more common than perceived.

But the riddle: "In classic wow, why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though the succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing?" So answer: Because succubus's Seduction is a crowd control that is used in PvP, making succubus warlocks more common in PvP, but when you see warlocks in the world they are questing with voidwalkers. Hmm.

Let's craft a concise answer: Because the succubus's Seduction is a crowd control that is used in PvP, making succubus warlocks more common in battlegrounds, but most warlocks you see in the world are questing and use voidwalkers for tanking. So the answer: Because succubus's Seduction is a crowd control that is used for PvP, making succubus warlocks more common than perceived.

Thus final answer: Because succubus's Seduction is a crowd control ability that is used in PvP, making succubus warlocks more common in PvP, while voidwalkers are used for questing. So the answer: Because succubus's Seduction is a crowd control that is used for PvP, making succubus warlocks more common than perceived.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>Because the Succubus’s **Seduction** is a crowd‑control spell that’s prized in PvP.  
Warlocks who spend time in battlegrounds or duels keep a Succubus for its charm, so they’re “more common” than you’d think.  

When you’re out in the world questing, however, the tank‑type Voidwalker is the pet most warlocks actually use, so the warlocks you see roaming the zones are usually with Voidwalkers even though a Succubus is the better leveling/questing pet. [end of text]
