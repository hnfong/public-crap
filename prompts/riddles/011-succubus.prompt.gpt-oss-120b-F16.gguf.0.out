<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer: In classic WoW, why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though succubus is usually better for leveling/questing? Hint: it's because a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived.

We need concise answer: Succubus has "Seduction" which can crowd control enemies, making them useful for PvP and certain quests? Actually succubus skill: "Seduction" (charm) which can be used to crowd control enemy players (PvP) and also to charm NPCs? In classic, succubus can charm humanoid enemies, which is useful for questing? But the hint says skill makes them more common than perceived. Maybe because succubus can be used to "banish" demons? No that's a warlock skill. Succubus has "Healthstone"? No.

Wait: In classic, warlocks have three demons: Voidwalker (tank), Imp (damage), Succubus (crowd control). Succubus is better for leveling due to "Seduction" which can charm humanoid enemies, allowing you to skip fights? But why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers? Because voidwalkers are the only demon that can be summoned without a soul shard? Actually you need a soul shard to summon any demon. But voidwalker is the default tank for solo questing. However the hint: "skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived." Maybe succubus can be used to "banish" demons? No.

Maybe the answer: Succubus is more common because of the "Health Funnel" skill? No.

Let's think: In classic, warlocks can have only one demon at a time. Many warlocks keep a voidwalker for tanking while questing, but succubus is better for leveling due to "Seduction" which can charm humanoids, making them easier to kill. However many warlocks are seen with voidwalkers because succubus is often used for PvP and group content, not solo. But the hint says skill makes them more common than perceived. Could be that succubus can be used to "banish" enemy players in PvP, making them popular in battlegrounds, thus you see many warlocks with voidwalkers because succubus is used elsewhere? Hmm.

Maybe the answer: Succubus is more common because of the "Soulstone" ability? Actually warlocks can cast Soulstone on themselves or others; succubus can cast "Suffering"? No.

Let's recall succubus abilities: Seduction (charm), Lash of Pain (damage), Whiplash (damage), maybe "Searing Pain"? No that's warlock. Succubus also has "Health Funnel" (shared with other demons). So the unique skill is Seduction. This can be used to crowd control enemy players (PvP) and also to charm NPCs for questing? Actually you cannot charm quest mobs for quest objectives. But you can charm humanoid mobs to avoid combat, making questing easier. So succubus is useful for questing, but still many warlocks use voidwalkers.

The hint: "skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived." Could be that succubus can be used to "banish" enemy demons? No.

Maybe the answer: Because succubus can be used to "crowd control" (Seduction) which is valuable in PvP, so many warlocks keep succubus for battlegrounds, but when leveling they use voidwalker. However the question: "why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though the succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing?" Answer: Because succubus is often used for PvP due to Seduction, making them more common in the world (players see them more) but not necessarily used for leveling. Wait the hint says skill makes them more common than perceived. Actually succubus's Seduction can be used to charm enemy players, making them a popular PvP tool, thus many warlocks keep succubus for battlegrounds, but when you see warlocks in the world they often have voidwalkers because they are soloing. Hmm.

But the riddle expects answer: Because succubus can be used to "crowd control" (Seduction) which is useful for PvP and questing, making them more common than perceived. So warlocks are seen with voidwalkers because they are soloing, but succubus is more common due to its PvP utility.

Thus concise answer: Succubus's Seduction (charm) makes it a popular PvP pet, so many warlocks keep a succubus for battlegrounds, but when you see warlocks in the world they are usually soloing with a voidwalker. However the riddle asks "why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though the succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing?" Answer: Because succubus is often used for PvP due to Seduction, making it more common, but voidwalker is the default tank for solo questing, so you see them more.

Let's craft concise answer: Because succubus's unique Seduction (charm) makes it a valuable PvP pet, so many warlocks keep a succubus for battlegrounds, but when you see warlocks in the world they are usually soloing and thus have a voidwalker. So the answer: Succubus's Seduction makes it more common than perceived. Provide concise answer.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>Because the succubus’s **Seduction** (charm) makes it the warlock’s go‑to pet for PvP and crowd‑control, many warlocks keep a succubus for battlegrounds and group play. When you see warlocks roaming the world, however, they’re usually solo‑leveling or questing, and the only demon that can reliably tank for a solo player is the **Voidwalker**. So the succubus is actually more common (thanks to its Seduction skill), but the Voidwalker is the pet you’ll most often see on a warlock in the open world. [end of text]
