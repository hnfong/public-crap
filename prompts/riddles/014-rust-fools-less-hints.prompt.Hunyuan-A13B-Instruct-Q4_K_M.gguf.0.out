Based on the content of the passage, it appears to have been written in **early 2023**. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Mention of C++20 and C++26**: The passage references C++20 features like modules and discusses C++26 features such as stackful coroutines and a safe range-based for loop. These were well-established topics by early 2023, as C++20 had been released in late 2020, and discussions about C++26 were beginning to emerge in the C++ community.

2. **Rust's pace of innovation**: The author notes that Rust's innovation has slowed down compared to its earlier rapid development, particularly in areas like async and generic associated types. This aligns with the state of Rust in early 2023, as the language was maturing and focusing on stability and backward compatibility.

3. **Carbon language**: The mention of Carbon, a new C++-compatible language being developed by Google, suggests the passage was written after Carbon's announcement in early 2023. Carbon was announced in February 2023, and discussions about it were gaining traction around that time.

4. **Community tone**: The author critiques Rust's community for being "imperious" and contrasts it with what they might perceive as a friendlier C++ community. This tone reflects ongoing debates within the Rust community in early 2023, as the language's growth and adoption continued to spark discussion.

5. **Call for collaboration**: The author invites people to join their Zulip instance and contribute to a C++ rewrite of their projects. This suggests they were actively looking for team members in mid-2023, which aligns with the timeline of the passage.

Given these points, the passage was likely written in **early 2023**, as it reflects the state of both Rust and C++ ecosystems at the time, including recent developments and community dynamics.
