Let's break down the clues in the passage to make an educated guess about the likely date it was written.

### Key Indicators in the Passage

#### 1. **Mentions of Rust and C++ Features**
- The passage discusses Rust's edition mechanism, the slow pace of innovation compared to C++, and mentions C++20, C++26, and even speculative future features like Herb Sutter's "cppfront" and "Carbon".
- It also refers to Rust's "near-monoculture of the Cargo build system" and the flexibility of CMake, Meson, etc., in C++.

#### 2. **Historical Context of Language Features**
- C++20 was released in **2019** (officially on November 11, 2019).
- C++26 is expected around **2025** (the standard is in the working draft phase as of mid-2024).
- The author mentions C++26's features (stackful coroutines, etc.) as "likely" to be in the next version, implying anticipation of features that haven't landed yet.
- The passage also refers to Rust's slower pace of innovation compared to C++, which is a recurring theme in discussions about Rust's evolution since about 2018-2020.

#### 3. **Author's Experience and Tone**
- The author claims to have been involved in Rust for "many years," but is now considering moving to C++. This suggests a perspective shaped by the evolution of both languages over a multi-year period.
- The reference to "the near-monoculture of the Cargo build system" and the relative immaturity of Rust's ecosystem compared to C++'s suggests a time after Rust's 1.0 release (2015) and well into its maturation phase, possibly after the stabilizing of async features and before the Rust 2021 edition changes (which happened in 2021).

#### 4. **Social Media and Community Comments**
- The author says they "hear that the Rust community can be extremely imperious" and mentions the C++ subreddit's humor, implying a familiarity with both communities as they exist today.
- The mention of the Rust Code of Conduct and diversity policies is a topic that has been prominent since around 2018-2020, as Rust's community has grown and these discussions have become more visible.

#### 5. **Leadership and Documentation**
- The reference to Stroustrup's paper on safety (likely the [Stroustrup's paper on "The Evolution of C++"](https://isocpp.org/publications/standards/standard source)), which is a well-known document but not new, suggests the author is writing after it was published (circa 2010), but more likely referencing it as still relevant in the mid-2010s or 2020s.

#### 6. **General Style and Phrasing**
- The tone is somewhat critical of Rust's "edition" and ecosystem rigidity, which is a theme that has been debated since the Rust 2018 edition (released in 2019) and the subsequent Rust 2021 edition (2021).
- The author's perspective seems to be that of someone who has seen Rust's evolution and is now considering a move to C++, which is a narrative that could be written at any point after Rust's early maturity phase, but especially after the 2021 edition.

### Reasoned Guess: **2021–2023**

#### Why?
- The mention of the **Rust 2021 edition** (released in 2021) and the slow pace of Rust innovation compared to C++'s rapid changes strongly suggests the author is writing after 2021.
- The reference to C++26's features (still in drafts as of 2024) implies anticipation of future releases, which would fit if written in 2022 or 2023.
- The critical tone toward Rust's ecosystem and edition mechanism aligns with post-2021 discourse, as the Rust community has been more focused on stability and backward compatibility, which became a point of contention.
- The author's nostalgia for C++'s "maturity" and the mention of "Linebender projects" (which sound like a code or game project name) could be a fictional stand-in but doesn't contradict any timeframe.
- The social media and community comments described are consistent with the mid-2020s, as both Rust and C++ communities have settled into their mature, sometimes polarized, but also humorous and engaging styles.

#### Possible Specific Dates:
- **Mid-to-late 2021:** After the Rust 2021 edition, but before the full impact of Rust 2023 features.
- **2022 or 2023:** As C++26 features are still in the future and the author is speculating about them, this fits well.

### Outside-the-Box Considerations

#### 1. **Meta-Commentary on Language Evolution**
The passage is almost philosophical, reflecting on the tension between rapid evolution (C++) and stability (Rust). This kind of meta-analysis is common in blog posts or long-form articles written when a language is in a transitional phase—often after a major edition or version change.

#### 2. **Reference to "Herb Sutter cppfront"**
Herb Sutter was a prominent figure in C++ and .NET/C#, and "cppfront" was a proposal for a new C++ syntax that never made it (but was discussed in the early 2000s). However, the author mentioning it as "potentially a new syntax as proposed by Herb Sutter cppfront" suggests either a recent rediscovery or a re-interpretation, but more likely the author is writing in a time when C++ is still actively evolving, which is true up to at least 2023.

#### 3. **"C++ compatible Carbon"**
"Carbon" is a new Apple programming language announced in 2022, but the author says "C++ compatible Carbon," which might be a hypothetical or a different context. If it's a fictional or internal project name, it doesn't help narrow the date, but if it's a reference to something emerging, it could be 2022+.

#### 4. **Zulip and Online Communities**
The use of Zulip (a modern chat platform) rather than older IRC or mailing lists suggests a post-2010s date, but that's not precise.

#### 5. **Hacker News and Reddit Mentions**
Referring to posting on Hacker News and Reddit in 2023 or 2022 is plausible, but again, not a strong indicator alone.

### Conclusion: **Most Likely Date Range — 2021 to 2023**

Given all the above, the passage was almost certainly written **between late 2021 and 2023**. The strongest clues point to the post-Rust 2021 edition era, when the language's direction was being debated, and C++ was seen as more rapidly evolving. The speculative discussion of C++26 and future features also fits this timeframe, as those are not yet finalized as of 2024.

If I had to pick a single year as the most probable: **2022 or 2023**.

#### Why not earlier?
- Before 2019, C++20 wasn't out yet, and the comparison between Rust and C++ innovation would be less relevant.
- Before the Rust 2021 edition (2021), the edition mechanism wasn't as central to the discussion, and the author's critique of Rust's rigidity would be less pronounced as a recent development.

#### Why not later?
- As of 2024, C++26 is still in the process of being finalized and not released, so the author's speculation about it would still be in the future, but the passage reads as if it's already anticipating those features, which is more natural in 2022-2023.

## Final Answer

**Most likely written in 2022 or 2023.**

This is based on the references to recent Rust editions, the pace of C++ language evolution, and speculative mentions of upcoming C++ standards that were not finalized as of mid-2024. The tone and content reflect a transitional phase in Rust's development, which aligns with the post-2021 era but before the language's ecosystem solidified even more.

If I had to give a single best guess date: **2022 or early 2023**. [end of text]
