The passage suggests a transition from Rust to C++ for the Linebender projects, highlighting various aspects such as build systems, safety, language evolution, and community dynamics. The distinctive writing style and the hint about a particular day and month suggest a connection to April Fools' Day, April 1st.

Here's how the passage aligns with this idea:

1. **Tone and Content**: The passage has a satirical tone, especially in its critique of the Rust community and the exaggerated praise for C++. It humorously contrasts the two languages and communities, which is typical of an April Fools' joke.

2. **Community Dynamics**: The description of the Rust community as "imperious" and the C++ community as "nicer and friendlier" is exaggerated and humorous, playing into stereotypes for comedic effect.

3. **Language Evolution**: The mention of future C++ features like "stackful coroutines" and "the new C++ compatible Carbon language" is speculative and humorous, as these are not standard features or languages in development.

4. **Conclusion**: The call for help with a "C++ rewrite" and the invitation to discuss on platforms like Hacker News and Reddit are typical of an April Fools' prank, where developers might joke about switching languages.

Given these elements, it is reasonable to conclude that the passage was written as an April Fools' Day joke, likely on April 1st. The distinctive writing style and the exaggerated claims align with the tradition of tech communities creating humorous or satirical content on this day. [end of text]
