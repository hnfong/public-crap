Based on the riddle and hint, the answer is that Succubus has the ability **Seduction**, which is a crowd control (CC) skill that causes the **Humanoid** creature to be charmed and walk towards the player. This often leads to accidentally pulling extra enemies, making it riskier for less experienced players. The Voidwalker's **Torment** skill is a reliable single-target taunt, providing safer and easier survivability, which is why it's more commonly seen despite the Succubus potentially having higher damage.
