This passage was likely written on April 1, 2023. The use of the hint in this context requires recognizing that the passage is a satirical or humorous piece, given the author's positive portrayal of C++ and negative portrayal of Rust, which is at odds with the general consensus in the tech community. The reference to "Linebender" is a play on "Linebender" being a real project by the author, but the context here is clearly a joke. The date April 1 is significant because it is April Fool's Day, a day when jokes and hoaxes are traditionally published. The author's positive comments about C++ and negative comments about Rust, along with the humorous undertones in the community section, are all indicative of a satirical piece meant to be a joke for April Fool's Day. The reference to C++26 and the mention of Carbon, a language proposed as a replacement for C++, also suggest that this was written in 2023, as C++26 would be the version following C++23, and discussions about Carbon were ongoing in 2023.
