To estimate the date when this passage was written, let's analyze various clues within the text, considering technological, community, and linguistic aspects:

1. **C++ Versions and Features Mentioned**:
   - **C++20**: Mentioned as bringing "modules" and expected to be "implemented fairly soon". C++20 was finalized in December 2020.
   - **C++26**: Speculatively mentioned with features like stackful coroutines, embedding binary file contents, and a safe range-based for loop. Given the 3-year cycle, if C++20 was 2020, C++23 would be 2023, and C++26 would be 2026. The speculative nature and the look towards C++26 suggests the passage is not from 2026 but rather looking forward to it.

2. **Rust Aspects**:
   - **Rust's Pace of Innovation**: Described as becoming "more sedate" with features like generic associated types and "type alias impl trait" mentioned. Generic associated types were stabilized in Rust 1.51 (October 2020), and "type alias impl trait" (more commonly referred to in the context of "impl Trait" or related features like "const generics" which were stabilized in Rust 1.51 as well, but the exact phrasing might refer to developments around or after Rust 1.60 (February 2022) with further trait system enhancements).
   - **Edition Mechanism and Backwards Compatibility**: This is a long-standing aspect of Rust, not indicative of a specific recent date.

3. **Community and External References**:
   - **C++ Subreddit's Sense of Humor**: This is a somewhat subjective point and doesn't tie to a specific date.
   - **Rust Community Characteristics**: The description of the Rust community could fit various periods but doesn't point to a specific year without more context.
   - **Herb Sutter's cppfront Proposal**: cppfront was announced in 2022, aiming to modernize C++'s tooling and syntax. This is a strong indicator.
   - **Carbon Language Mention**: Announced in October 2022 by Google as a potential successor or companion to C++, focusing on compatibility and modernity.

4. **Other Clues**:
   - **Zulip Instance for Collaboration**: Zulip's popularity for open-source projects has grown over the years, but this doesn't specify a date.
   - **Hacker News and /r/rust for Discussion**: Common platforms for such discussions without a specific timeline indicator.

**Synthesizing the Clues**:

- The mention of C++20 being "implemented fairly soon" suggests the passage is not from 2020 (when C++20 was finalized) but somewhat after, as implementation and widespread adoption would take time.
- The speculative look towards C++26 and the mention of cppfront (2022) and Carbon (October 2022) provide strong indicators.
- The description of Rust's feature pace and the specific features mentioned suggest a post-2020, possibly early to mid-2022 timeframe for the Rust aspects, but the combination with C++ clues pushes the estimate forward.

**Best Guess for the Date of Writing**:
Given the balance of these clues, especially the mention of cppfront and Carbon (both 2022), and considering the time it would take for C++20 to be seen as "soon to be implemented" in broader project contexts (e.g., beyond standardization), the most likely period for this passage's writing is:

**Late 2022 to Early 2023**

However, since the question asks for a specific guess in the format of a date and considering the latest specific event mentioned (Carbon in October 2022), a pinpointed guess would be:

**February 2023** (allowing some months after the October 2022 Carbon announcement for the author to be aware and write about it, and before the passage of enough time to mention more recent C++ or Rust developments not included here). 

**Note**: Without more precise markers, this remains an educated guess. The actual date could slightly precede or follow this estimate based on the author's exposure to and timing of writing about the latest developments. [end of text]
