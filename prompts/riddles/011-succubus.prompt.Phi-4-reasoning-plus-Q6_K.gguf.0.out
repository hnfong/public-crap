We are asked: "Riddle: In classic wow, why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though the succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing? Hint: it's because a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived." We need to answer concisely.

Let's analyze: In classic wow, warlocks have two pet choices: Voidwalker and Succubus. The succubus is usually considered better for leveling and questing because of its damage and utility. But why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers? The hint: "it's because a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived."
