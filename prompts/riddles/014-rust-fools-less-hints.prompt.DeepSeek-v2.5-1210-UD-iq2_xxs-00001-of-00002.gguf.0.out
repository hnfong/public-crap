The passage provides several clues that can help us estimate when it was written. Here's a breakdown of the key points:

1. **C++ Language Evolution**:
   - The passage mentions C++20 and C++26, which are future versions of the language. C++20 was finalized in late 2019, and C++26 is expected to be finalized around 2026. This suggests that the passage was written sometime after C++20 was released but before C++26 was finalized.
   - The passage also mentions "stackful coroutines" and "safe range-based for loop" as features expected in C++26. These features are part of the C++23 and C++26 proposals, indicating that the passage was written after these proposals were known but before their finalization.

2. **Rust Language Evolution**:
   - The passage mentions "generic associated types" and "type alias impl trait" as features that have recently landed or are forthcoming. Generic associated types were stabilized in Rust 1.60, which was released in June 2022. This suggests that the passage was written after June 2022.
   - The passage also mentions that Rust's pace of innovation has slowed down, which is a perspective that could be formed after observing the language's development over several years.

3. **Community and Social Media**:
   - The passage mentions the Rust community's behavior on social media, which is a perspective that could be formed based on recent interactions. The mention of the C++ subreddit's sense of humor and the Rust community's code of conduct suggests that the author has been active in both communities recently.

4. **Zulip Instance**:
   - The passage mentions a Zulip instance, which is a real-time chat platform. Zulip has been around for several years, but the specific mention of it in the context of the Linebender projects suggests that the author is using it in their current work, likely in the recent past.

5. **Hacker News and /r/rust**:
   - The passage mentions discussing the topic on Hacker News and /r/rust, which are popular forums for discussing technology and programming languages. This suggests that the author is engaging with the broader tech community, likely in the recent past.

**Conclusion**:
Given the information about C++20, C++26, Rust 1.60, and the author's recent engagement with both communities, the passage was likely written sometime in **2022 or 2023**. The specific mention of Zulip and the author's perspective on the Rust community's behavior further narrows the timeframe to the recent past. [end of text]
