 Based on the hint about the distinctive writing style connected to one particular day and month of the year, I believe this passage was written on April 1st (April Fool's Day) due to its satirical and humorous tone. The author sarcastically criticizes the Rust community and praises the C++ community, while expressing their excitement for C++ features and their plans to migrate the Linebender projects to C++. The passage is likely a parody or a playful jab at the Rust vs. C++ debate, rather than a serious statement.

The author's criticisms of Rust's build system monoculture, safety guarantees, and community behavior are presented in an exaggerated and humorous manner, suggesting that the passage is not meant to be taken seriously. The author's confidence in their ability to avoid memory safety issues and their dismissal of the dangers of memory bugs are also presented in a tongue-in-cheek manner.

The passage's focus on C++ features and language evolution, as well as the author's enthusiasm for C++'s future developments, further support the idea that the passage is a playful tribute to C++ rather than a serious critique of Rust.

Overall, the passage's distinctive writing style and satirical tone suggest that it was written on April Fool's Day as a lighthearted joke or parody. [end of text]
