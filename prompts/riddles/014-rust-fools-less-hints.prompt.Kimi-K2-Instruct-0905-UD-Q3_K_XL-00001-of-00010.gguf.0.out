The passage can’t be pinned to a single calendar day, but every concrete detail in it sits in a very narrow window:

- C++20 is spoken of as “just out” (“brings us modules … I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon”).  
  C++20 was finalised in Prague (Feb 2020) and first appeared in GCC 10 / Clang 10 (both released April 2020).  
  “Modules” did not become practically usable until late 2020 / early 2021.

- C++26 is talked about as the *next* cycle (“C++26 will likely have …”).  
  That wording only makes sense while C++23 is still the *future* standard.  
  C++23 entered its final ballot in late 2022 and was formally published in December 2023; once that happened writers switch to saying “C++29” when they look beyond the current draft.  
  Therefore the text has to be earlier than Dec 2023.

- Carbon is mentioned as a brand-new, still-experimental “C++ compatible” language.  
  Carbon was first unveiled publicly at CppNorth 2022 (July 2022).

- The author still treats the Rust edition mechanism as a *recent* brake on innovation (“recently landed features such as generic associated types …”).  
  GATs were stabilised in Rust 1.65, released 3 Nov 2022.

Putting those together the only stretch that fits is:

  after July 2022  (Carbon is public)  
  before Dec 2023   (C++23 is not yet “the next one”).

Inside that window the tone of the piece – Cargo being a “monoculture”, C++20 modules still “not quite here”, GATs just landed – matches the blog-post climate of autumn 2022.

Hence the best single-date guess is:

  **November 2022**  (± a month or two). [end of text]
