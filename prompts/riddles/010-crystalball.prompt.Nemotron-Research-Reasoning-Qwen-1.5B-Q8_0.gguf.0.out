Okay, so I have this short story to analyze. The story is about a woman buying a crystal ball from an antique shop. The events are: she pays, the clerk says, "Be sure to cover it when you leave your house." The lady asks, "Why? Spirits?" I need to figure out why the clerk said that and explain it concisely.

Let me break it down. The woman buys a crystal ball. Then she pays, and as she does, the clerk tells her to cover it when she leaves her house. So the clerk is giving her a precautionary measure. Maybe she's worried about forgetting it or something.

The question is why did the clerk say that? The lady then asks "Why? Spirits?" So the clerk is probably explaining something about spirits or spirits of the deceased? Maybe spirits are a metaphor or a reason to cover the crystal ball.

In some contexts, especially in old stories or cultural references, "cover it when you leave" might be a common saying. Maybe it's a reminder to leave it at home or something. But the lady asks "Why? Spirits?" So perhaps spirits are a metaphor for something important.

Alternatively, "cover it when you leave your house" could be a precautionary note, like not leaving it in a place where it might get lost or forgotten. But the connection to spirits might be a symbolic one. Maybe spirits are a symbol of something important, like a deceased person or a deceased loved one, so the woman is worried about forgetting it.

So the clerk is probably telling her that she should cover the crystal ball with spirits or something symbolic to ensure it's not lost or forgotten. The "why" is to remind her to keep it safe or to remember something important.

So putting it together: The clerk said that she should cover the crystal ball when she leaves because it's important to remember or protect it, perhaps metaphorically, using spirits as a symbol of something significant. So the answer is that the clerk was telling her to cover it to ensure it's not lost or forgotten, possibly using the metaphor of spirits to symbolize something important or to be remembered.

I think that's the reasoning. So the clerk was probably using "cover it when you leave your house" as a precautionary note, and the "Why? Spirits" is a hint that it's about remembering something, maybe spirits of loved ones or something symbolic.

The clerk mentioned covering the crystal ball when leaving because it's important to ensure it's not lost or forgotten, metaphorically using "spirits" to symbolize something significant, like a deceased loved one or a symbol of importance to be remembered. Thus, the clerk was providing a precautionary reminder to keep the crystal ball safe and to consider its symbolic meaning.

**Answer:** The clerk was telling the lady to cover the crystal ball when leaving because it symbolizes protection and remembering something significant, such as spirits, to ensure it's not lost or forgotten. [end of text]
