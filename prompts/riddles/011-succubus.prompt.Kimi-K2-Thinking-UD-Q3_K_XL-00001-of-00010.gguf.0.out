The user is asking a riddle about World of Warcraft Classic. The question is: why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though the succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing? The hint says it's because of a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived.

Let me think about warlock pets in Classic WoW:

1. **Voidwalker**: The tanking pet, good for solo leveling because it can hold aggro and has high health. It has Torment (taunt), Sacrifice (shield), Consume Shadows (heal), Suffering (AoE taunt). It's the go-to for most leveling warlocks because it keeps mobs off the warlock.

2. **Succubus**: The DPS pet, deals more damage but is squishy. Has Lash of Pain (damage), Soothing Kiss (threat reduction), Seduction (crowd control), Lesser Invisibility. The hint mentions a skill that makes them "more common than perceived."

Wait, the riddle says succubus is "usually the better choice for leveling and questing" but "most warlocks are seen with voidwalkers". This seems contradictory. The hint says it's because of "a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived."

Let me reconsider. The riddle is phrased a bit tricky. It says succubus is "usually the better choice" but warlocks are seen with voidwalkers. Then the hint says it's because of a succubus skill that makes them "more common than perceived."

Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the premise. Let me think about what skill a succubus has that would make them "more common than perceived."

The succubus has:
- Seduction (seduces humanoid target, CC)
- Lesser Invisibility (makes her invisible)
- Soothing Kiss (reduces threat)
- Lash of Pain (damage)

Wait, "more common than perceived" - could this refer to the fact that you often don't SEE the succubus because she's invisible? The succubus has Lesser Invisibility, which makes her invisible when not in combat. So warlocks might HAVE a succubus out, but you don't see them because they're invisible. That would explain why voidwalkers are "seen" more often - because the succubus is invisible!

But the riddle says "most warlocks are seen with voidwalkers". If a warlock has a succubus out but it's invisible, you wouldn't see the pet at all, you'd just see the warlock alone. So that doesn't quite fit.

Let me re-read: "why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers even though the succubus is usually the better choice for leveling and questing?"

Maybe the premise is wrong? In Classic WoW, the voidwalker is actually the better choice for leveling due to its tanking abilities. The succubus is better for PvP due to Seduction. But the riddle states succubus is better for leveling/questing, which is generally not true. So maybe the riddle is playing with words.

The hint: "it's because a skill of succubus that makes them more common than perceived."

"More common than perceived" - this strongly suggests something about visibility. The succubus has Lesser Invisibility. So maybe the answer is that you don't see the succubus because it's invisible, making it seem like warlocks are using voidwalkers more often.

But that doesn't explain why warlocks would be "seen with voidwalkers" - if they have an invisible succubus, they wouldn't be seen with ANY pet.

Let me think differently. Maybe the riddle is about a specific skill that makes succubus "more common" in terms of usage, but not visually.

Wait, could it be about the summoning ritual? No, that doesn't make sense.

Let me reconsider the premise. Maybe in some specific context, the succubus IS better for leveling/questing? For example, for drain-tanking or dot-heavy builds where you don't need a tank pet? But that's niche.

Actually, I think the riddle might be playing on the word "seen". Warlocks are "seen with voidwalkers" because the voidwalker is visible. But succubi are "more common than perceived" because they have Lesser Invisibility, so when warlocks DO use succubi, you don't see them, making voidwalkers appear more common by comparison.

But the question asks why warlocks are "seen with voidwalkers" - implying the observation is of warlocks who have visible pets.

Let me think about the succubus skills again:
- Seduction: CC ability
- Lesser Invisibility: Makes the succubus invisible out of combat

The phrase "more common than perceived" is key. If something is more common than perceived, it means you think it's rare but it's actually common, OR you don't perceive it as much as it actually happens.

The succubus's Lesser Invisibility would make her not perceived (not seen). So succubi are more common than perceived because they're often invisible.

But why would that cause warlocks to be SEEN with voidwalkers? 

Maybe the answer is simply: Because the succubus is invisible (Lesser Invisibility), so you don't see the warlocks who are using succubi, making it appear that most warlocks use voidwalkers.

That seems to be the most logical interpretation of the hint. The riddle might be intentionally stating that succubus is "better" to set up the misconception, but the real answer is about visibility.

Let me verify: In Classic WoW, the Succubus does have Lesser Invisibility, which makes her invisible when not in combat. So when warlocks are running around with a succubus, you don't see the pet. When they're running with a voidwalker, you do see it. Therefore, in the open world, you observe more warlocks with voidwalkers simply because those are the ones you can see. The warlocks with succubi are there, but you don't perceive them as having a pet out.

So the concise answer would be: Because the succubus has Lesser Invisibility, making her invisible when not in combat, so warlocks using succubi aren't seen with a pet, while those with voidwalkers are visible.

But wait, the riddle says "most warlocks are seen with voidwalkers". This could mean "when you see a warlock with a pet, it's usually a voidwalker" OR "most warlocks that you see have voidwalkers with them."

Given the hint, I think the answer is about the invisibility. The succubus is "more common than perceived" because you don't perceive (see) many of them due to invisibility.

Actually, let me reconsider the entire riddle structure. Maybe it's a trick question where the premise is intentionally misleading.

The succubus's Seduction ability is a channeled CC that can only be used out of combat or on a mob that's not being damaged. It's great for PvP but not as useful for standard leveling.

Wait, could the answer be about the summoning cost? No, that doesn't fit the hint.

Let me think about the phrase "more common than perceived" again. Could it mean that succubi are more commonly USED than commonly SEEN? Yes, that fits with invisibility.

So the answer is: Because the succubus's Lesser Invisibility makes her invisible when not in combat, so warlocks using succubi appear to be alone, while only warlocks with voidwalkers are visibly seen with a pet.

But the riddle says "most warlocks are seen with voidwalkers". This is about the observation bias. You only see warlocks with visible pets (voidwalkers), so it creates the impression that most warlocks use them. The succubus users are there but invisible.

Actually, I think there's another interpretation. Maybe the riddle is about the Seduction skill itself? Does Seduction make succubi "more common"? No, that doesn't fit.

Let me think about the succubus being "better for leveling and questing". In Classic WoW, this is generally false - the voidwalker is better for leveling due to tanking. However, for specific strategies like drain-tanking or for certain quests where CC is valuable, succubus could be better. But the key is the hint.

The hint specifically points to a succubus skill. The succubus has:
1. Lash of Pain - damage
2. Soothing Kiss - threat reduction
3. Seduction - CC
4. Lesser Invisibility - invisibility

"More common than perceived" most directly connects to Lesser Invisibility.

So the answer should be: The succubus's Lesser Invisibility makes her invisible when not in combat, so warlocks using succubi aren't seen with a pet, creating the false impression that voidwalkers are more common.

But the riddle says "why are most warlocks seen with voidwalkers". This is about what is observed. The answer is about observational bias due to invisibility.

Let me craft a concise answer: "Because the succubus's Lesser Invisibility makes her invisible when not in combat, so warlocks using succubi appear to be alone, while voidwalkers are always visible."

Wait, but the riddle says succubus is "usually the better choice". This is still bothering me because it's not accurate. In Classic WoW, voidwalker is the standard leveling pet. Succ
