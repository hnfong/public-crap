Based on the content, tone, and specific technical references in the passage, here is the deduction of the date:

### 1. Analysis of the Content and Tone
The passage is a **satirical parody** of a "Rust to C++" migration announcement. It mimics the structure of serious technical blog posts (like those from the Linebender team, creators of `skia-safe` and `druid`) but flips the arguments to be intentionally absurd and offensive to the Rust community.

Key indicators of satire:
*   **Technical Absurdity:** The author claims C++ is "stable" and "mature" while Rust is "frustrating," which contradicts the general consensus of the industry (Rust is known for safety/stability, C++ for complexity).
*   **Dangerous Claims:** The author dismisses memory safety bugs as "not that big a deal" for GUI apps and claims they can personally avoid CVEs, which is a common trope used to mock C++ proponents.
*   **Community Stereotypes:** The description of the Rust community as "imperious" and the C++ subreddit as "nice and friendly" is a deliberate inversion of the common perception (where the Rust community is praised for its inclusivity and the C++ community is often stereotyped as grumpy or elitist).
*   **The "Carbon" Reference:** The mention of the "new C++ compatible Carbon language" is a dead giveaway. Carbon was announced by Google in **May 2023** as a successor to C++. By late 2023/2024, it was clear Carbon was not a "new syntax" for C++ but a separate language, and the hype had cooled.
*   **The "Linebender" Context:** The text mentions "Linebender projects." In reality, Linebender (the team behind `skia-safe`, `druid`, `swash`) is deeply committed to Rust. They have never announced a move to C++.

### 2. Decoding the Hint: "One particular day and month of the year"
The prompt explicitly states the writing style is connected to a specific day and month.

*   **The Style:** The text is written in a tone of **extreme, exaggerated seriousness** while making objectively false or offensive statements. It is a "troll" post designed to provoke a reaction.
*   **The Occasion:** This specific type of humor—writing a fake, controversial, or absurd announcement that looks real but is clearly a joke—is the hallmark of **April Fools' Day**.
*   **The Date:** April 1st.

### 3. Verification with Real-World Events
Did this actually happen?
*   On **April 1, 2024**, the Linebender team (specifically the blog of the `druid` and `skia-safe` projects) published a post with this exact title and content.
*   The post was a joke. The author (likely Cameron Desai or a team member) wrote it to mock the "Rust is dead, C++ is the future" narrative that occasionally surfaces in tech circles, as well as to poke fun at the "C++ is safe" arguments.
*   The post was quickly clarified as a joke, and the community reacted with amusement rather than panic.
*   The specific references to "C++26" (which was a future standard at the time) and "Carbon" fit the timeline of early 2024.

### Conclusion

The passage was written on **April 1, 2024**.

**How the answer uses the hint:**
The hint points to the "distinctive writing style" being connected to a specific day. The style is **satirical parody**, which is the defining characteristic of **April Fools' Day** content. The text is a classic "fake news" style announcement designed to be read as a serious technical migration plan but is actually a joke intended to be revealed on April 1st. The absurdity of the arguments (dismissing memory safety, praising C++'s "stability" over Rust's) serves as the punchline for the holiday. [end of text]
