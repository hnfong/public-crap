It seems like Bob's description of his meal is a bit unconventional and possibly a playful or exaggerated way of describing something. Let's break down what he said:

- **Aged organic milk**: This could be referring to yogurt or kefir, which are aged dairy products.
- **Tossed over seasoned tomato purée**: This sounds like a sauce, possibly a marinara or tomato sauce.
- **Spread on baked whole wheat**: This suggests that the tomato sauce was spread on a whole wheat base, like a whole wheat pizza crust or bread.

Putting it all together, it sounds like Bob might have eaten a whole wheat pizza or bread topped with a tomato sauce and some form of aged dairy product, possibly yogurt or kefir.

### Was it healthy?
- **Whole wheat base**: Whole wheat is a good source of fiber and nutrients, making it a healthy choice.
- **Tomato purée**: Tomatoes are rich in vitamins and antioxidants, so a tomato purée is generally healthy.
- **Aged organic milk (yogurt or kefir)**: These are good sources of probiotics and protein, which are beneficial for gut health and overall nutrition.

However, the healthiness of the meal also depends on the specific ingredients and preparation methods. For example, if the tomato purée is high in added sugars or if the aged milk is high in fat, it might not be as healthy. Additionally, the portion size and any other toppings or additions (like cheese or meat) would also affect the overall healthiness of the meal.

### Alice's Reaction
Alice's reaction of "wtf" suggests that she was surprised or confused by Bob's description or the photo he sent. It's possible that the combination of ingredients or the way they were presented was unexpected or unusual, leading to her surprise.

In summary, Bob's meal could be healthy, but it depends on the specific details. Alice's reaction indicates that the meal was either very unconventional or not what she expected. [end of text]
