Bob’s “aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat” is just a pompous way of saying:

- aged organic milk = moldy cheese  
- seasoned tomato purée = pizza-sauce  
- baked whole wheat = pizza crust  

In other words, he ate a slice of plain cheese pizza.  
It’s not exactly unhealthy, but it’s hardly the virtuous meal his wording implied, so Alice’s “wtf” is the amused eye-roll at his creative health-food spin on an ordinary piece of pizza. [end of text]
