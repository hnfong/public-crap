 The passage appears to be a satirical piece, and the hint suggests that the distinctive writing style is connected to a specific day and month of the year. Given the content of the passage, which includes references to C++20, C++26, and the mention of Herb Sutter's cppfront proposal, we can infer that it was written after these topics were relevant in the C++ community.

The mention of "stackful coroutines" and "a new syntax as proposed by Herb Sutter cppfront" suggests that the passage was written after these ideas were publicly discussed. Herb Sutter's cppfront proposal was introduced around mid-2021. Additionally, the passage mentions "the new C++ compatible Carbon language," which was announced by Google in July 2022.

However, the satirical nature of the passage and the hint provided point towards a specific day known for pranks and hoaxes: April Fools' Day (April 1st). The passage's tone, especially the sections discussing the author's confidence in avoiding memory safety issues and the community aspects, seems to be in line with the kind of humorous, exaggerated content often shared on that day.

Given this, the most likely date for when this passage was written is April 1st of a year after mid-2021, considering the references to C++20 and cppfront, and before the knowledge cutoff in 2023. Therefore, the best guess for the date this was written would be April 1, 2022, or April 1, 2023. Since the passage does not mention any events that would clearly place it in 2023, April 1, 2022, seems to be the most fitting date, aligning with the satirical style and the hint provided.
