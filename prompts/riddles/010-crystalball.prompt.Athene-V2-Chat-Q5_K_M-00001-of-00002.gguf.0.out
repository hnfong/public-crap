The clerk likely said this because there is a superstition that crystal balls can attract or channel spirits or negative energies when left uncovered. By suggesting she cover it, the clerk is adhering to this belief, possibly to protect the woman from any潜在的灵异活动或负面能量. However, in a more practical sense, the clerk might also be advising her to cover it to protect it from dust or damage. The woman's question about spirits indicates she interpreted the advice in the context of the supernatural.
