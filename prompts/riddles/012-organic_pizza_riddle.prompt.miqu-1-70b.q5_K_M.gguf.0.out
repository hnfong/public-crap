 Based on the conversation, Bob claimed to have eaten aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat. However, Alice's reaction suggests that what Bob sent her in the photo did not match his description or her expectations of a healthy meal. 

It's hard to determine the exact nature of the discrepancy without seeing the photo, but it's possible that the meal looked unappetizing or unhealthy, or that it didn't resemble the description Bob provided. 

As for whether the described meal is healthy, it's worth noting that whole wheat bread and tomato purée can be part of a healthy diet, as they are sources of fiber, vitamins, and minerals. However, the use of aged organic milk in this context is unclear, as milk is typically not aged in a way that would make it safe to consume raw. Additionally, the term "seasoned" is vague and could refer to a variety of ingredients, some of which may not be healthy in large quantities. Without more information, it's difficult to make a definitive assessment of the healthfulness of the meal. [end of text]
