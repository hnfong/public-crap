The passage was almost certainly written on **April 1st, 2024**. 

Here's how I arrived at that conclusion, using the distinctive writing style as a hint:

The entire piece is a meticulously crafted, highly ironic, and deliberately contrarian take on the Rust vs. C++ debate. The author's "frustrations" with Rust, the dismissal of safety concerns, the confident assertion of personal coding skill despite past CVEs, the glorification of C++'s rapid (and often breaking) evolution, and the condescending dismissal of the Rust community's values are all exaggerated to the point of absurdity. 

The author's claim that the C++ community is "nicer and friendlier" and that programming languages should be "free of politics" is a particularly strong indicator. The entire tone is so aggressively against the grain of current tech discourse that it reads like a parody. 

The hint is the distinctive writing style, which is connected to one particular day and month of the year. The writing style is a perfect fit for an **April Fool's Day** joke. The author is deliberately playing into the stereotypes and frustrations of both communities to create a piece that is both infuriating and hilarious. 

The reference to C++26 features (stackful coroutines, etc.) suggests the writing occurred in early 2024, as those features are still under development. The mention of Hacker News and /r/rust as discussion venues further supports a recent date. 

The entire piece is a troll, and a very well-executed one at that. The date April 1st, 2024, is the only logical conclusion. [end of text]
