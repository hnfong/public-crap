The succubus has a skill called "Seduction" which can be used to charm humanoids. This can be a double-edged sword because if not used properly, it can interfere with quests or leveling by charming NPCs that are needed for other purposes. The voidwalker, on the other hand, is a tank pet that doesn't have such a skill, making it safer for general use. Hence, warlocks might prefer voidwalkers to avoid accidental interference from the succubus's Seduction.
