The passage is written in a tongue-in-cheek, exaggerated style that heaps praise on C++ while dismissing Rust’s strengths—especially its safety guarantees.  The giveaway is the third paragraph under “Safety,” where the author claims that memory-safety bugs are “not fundamentally different than logic errors” and that customers will simply understand when a crash is “not our fault.”  That level of self-parody, combined with the closing line “Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust,” is the classic calling-card of an April-Fools’ post.

Therefore, the article was almost certainly written on 1 April (April Fools’ Day) of some year.  The exact year is less important than the day; the style and content are unmistakably satire. [end of text]
