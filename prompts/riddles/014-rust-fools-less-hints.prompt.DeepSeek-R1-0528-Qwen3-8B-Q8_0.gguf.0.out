First, the passage is about the author's frustrations with Rust and their move to C++ for the Linebender projects. It mentions specific Rust features and C++ features, so I need to look for clues about when these were relevant.

Key points from the passage:

- **Build systems**: Talks about Cargo in Rust and alternatives like Bazel, CMake, Meson, Autotools, etc. in C++. Also mentions that Cargo is the near-monoculture, which might imply that this was written before Cargo became the standard or after some changes.

- **Safety**: Discusses giving up Rust's safety guarantees. References CVEs from font parsing code in Android, which is a specific example. Android development might be related to Rust or C++ around certain times.

- **Language evolution**: Compares C++ and Rust innovation. C++ has versions every 3 years, with C++20 and C++26 mentioned. C++20 includes modules, and C++26 has stackful coroutines, etc. Rust has been slower, with features like generic associated types and "type alias impl trait" being recent.

- **Community**: Describes the Rust community as imperious and Rust's code of conduct. This might be a reference to past issues, like the infamous Rust RFC about code of conduct or controversies around it.

- **Conclusion**: Announces a move to C++ and invites collaboration, with mentions of Hacker News and /r/rust, which are platforms where such discussions might have happened.

Now, to date this, I need to think about the timeline of these events.

Start with language versions:

- C++20 was released in December 2020.

- C++26 is expected to be around 2026 or later, but the passage says "C++26 will likely have," so it's speculative but based on the standardization cycle.

- Rust: The passage mentions that async was a major effort, which was stabilized in Rust 1.39.0 in 2019. Generic associated types were stabilized in Rust 1.51.0 in 2020. "Type alias impl trait" is part of RFCs and might not have been stabilized yet when this was written.

Also, the author mentions CVEs from font parsing code in Android. Android development with Rust might be related to when Rust was gaining traction in that area.

The build system part: Cargo is the default, but there are alternatives. This might be written after some criticism or when other systems were being considered.

Community part: The Rust community's code of conduct was a hot topic around 2018-2019, with debates and changes. The author says "the Rust community can be extremely imperious," which could be a reference to that period.

The author also mentions the C++ core guidelines, which were introduced by Herb Sutter around 2017-2018.

Let's think about the date of writing. The passage is from someone's perspective, likely a blog post or announcement.

It ends with "Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust." Hacker News and Reddit are platforms where posts are made, and discussions happen. But that doesn't give a specific date.

Perhaps the key is in the language features. C++20 is mentioned, so the passage must be written after C++20 was announced or stabilized. C++20 was formally approved in late 2020, but it was in development.

Rust: Async was stabilized in 2019, so the passage could be written around that time or later.

But the author says "recently landed features such as generic associated types have more of the flavor of making combinations of existing features work as expected rather than bringing any fundamentally new capabilities." Generic associated types were stabilized in 2020, so if this is written in 2020, it might be referring to that.

Also, "the forthcoming 'type alias impl trait'" – this is an RFC that was being discussed around 2020-2021, I think.

Let me recall the timeline:

- Rust 1.0 was in 2015.

- Rust 1.39.0 (stabilizing const fn and async) was in 2019.

- Rust 1.51.0 (stabilizing generic associated types) was in 2020.

- C++20 was released in December 2020.

The author mentions that in C++, there are many build systems, and in Rust, Cargo is dominant. This might be written after the Rust community started to stabilize and Cargo became the standard, but before it was fully entrenched or after some backlash.

The community part: The Rust community's code of conduct was controversial. In 2018, there was a debate about it, and it was implemented around that time. The author says "the Rust community is also known for its code of conduct and other policies promoting diversity," which might be a reference to the time when these were established or criticized.

Also, the author pines for C++'s stable, mature foundation. C++ has been around for decades, while Rust is newer.

But the specific frustration might be tied to the language's maturity.

Another clue: The author mentions "we can use modern C++ techniques to avoid many of the dangers of raw pointers," which is true, but raw pointers have always been part of C++. However, with C++20, there are features like concepts that might help with safety, but the passage is more about the language evolving.

C++20 has modules, which are a big deal for build systems, reducing build times.

In Rust, the build system was a point of criticism, especially with Cargo's limitations in large projects.

The passage says: "We haven’t firmly decided on a build system for the Linebender projects yet, but most likely it will be CMake with plans to evaluate other systems and migrate, perhaps Meson."

This suggests that at the time of writing, Cargo might not be ideal, and they're considering alternatives.

Now, for the date: Let's look at the C++ version mentioned. C++20 is key here.

C++20 was standardized in 2020, but the passage is written from the perspective of someone who is excited about it.

Also, the author mentions C++26, which is future-oriented.

Rust: The pace of innovation has slowed due to stability commitments.

This might be written in 2020 or 2021, when C++20 was new, and Rust was still innovating but with more caution.

But let's see the CVE reference: "I’ve learned from that experience, and am confident I can avoid such mistakes in the future." The CVE is from font parsing code in Android. When was that? I'm not sure, but Android development with Rust might have been prominent around 2018-2019 or later.

Perhaps the author is referring to a specific incident. For example, there might have been a notable CVE related to Rust around that time.

Another thing: The Carbon language is mentioned as a new C++-compatible language. Carbon was announced in 2021 by Meta, I think.

Let me check that.

Carbon was announced by Meta in March 2021 as a C++-compatible language.

So, if the passage mentions Carbon, it must be written after that announcement.

The passage says: "C++ has even more exciting changes to look forward to, including potentially a new syntax as proposed by Herb Sutter cppfront, and even the new C++ compatible Carbon language."

It explicitly mentions Carbon, so the writing date must be after March 2021.

Also, C++20 is mentioned, which was in December 2020.

C++26 is mentioned as "will likely have," so it's not current, but future.

Now, the community part: Hacker News and /r/rust are mentioned for discussion. But that doesn't help with dating.

Perhaps the style or the context gives clues.

The author is involved in Rust for many years, so if this is a recent frustration, it might be from someone who has been using Rust since its early days.

But let's think about when such a sentiment might have been expressed.

In 2018-2019, there was a lot of debate about Rust's safety and its community. For example, the Rust code of conduct was controversial.

The author says: "I’ve been involved in Rust and the Rust community for many years now." So, they've been around for a while.

Also, "Rust was a good experiment, and there are aspects I will look back on fondly" – this might imply that they've seen Rust's evolution and are now moving on.

But the key is the language features.

C++20 modules: Stabilized in C++20.

Rust's async: Stabilized in 2019.

Generic associated types: Stabilized in 2020.

"type alias impl trait": This is an RFC that was implemented in Rust 1.55.0 in 2021, I think.

Let me confirm the dates.

- Rust 1.39.0: December 5, 2019 (async/await)

- Rust 1.51.0: May 11, 2020 (generic associated types)

- Rust 1.55.0: November 8, 2020 (type_alias_impl_trait)

C++20: December 10, 2020.

C++26: Not yet, but planned.

The passage mentions C++20 and C++26, so it must be written after C++20 was released.

Also, Carbon: Announced in March 2021.

So, writing date after March 2021.

But let's see if there's a specific event.

The author might be referring to the time when Rust was gaining popularity but also facing criticism for its complexity or build system issues.

Another clue: The build system part. Cargo has been the default since Rust 1.0, but by 2020, it was becoming a point of discussion, especially for larger projects.
