Okay, the user has shared a short story about a woman buying a crystal ball and the clerk's warning. They want me to explain why the clerk said "Be sure to cover it when you leave your house" concisely. 

Hmm, this is a classic case of misdirection in storytelling. The clerk's warning seems supernatural at first ("spirits?"), but the real reason is mundane. Let me think... 

Ah! The key is in the word "cover" - not "cover up" or "cover with cloth," but literally "cover" as in protect from elements. Crystal balls are fragile glass objects. If she leaves it uncovered on a windowsill or table, sunlight could cause it to shatter from thermal stress. 

The clerk's phrasing is deliberately ambiguous to create that "spirits" misunderstanding. Smart storytelling trick. The user probably wants to see if I catch the practical explanation behind the supernatural setup. 

I should keep it super concise as requested - no need for extra fluff. Just state the glass fragility angle plainly. The "spirits" question is the red herring, so I'll skip analyzing that. 

...Wait, is there any chance it's about actual spirits? No, that'd be silly for a clerk to say in an antique shop. The warning makes zero sense for supernatural reasons - spirits wouldn't care about covering it. Definitely a physical property thing. 

*checks physics* Yep, glass expands when heated. Sunlight through a crystal ball could concentrate heat like a magnifying glass. Classic physics hazard. 

User seems to enjoy puzzle-like stories - they'll appreciate the clean explanation. No need to over-explain. Just: "The clerk meant to protect the fragile glass from sunlight causing it to shatter." 

*mental note* Must resist adding "like a magnifying glass" - they said "concisely." Cut that. 

Final answer locked in: it's about preventing breakage from solar heat, not spirits.

The clerk meant to warn her about **sunlight causing the crystal ball to shatter** (due to thermal stress or magnification), not spirits. The phrase "cover it" refers to protecting the fragile glass from direct sun, not supernatural entities. The "spirits?" question is a red herring. [end of text]
