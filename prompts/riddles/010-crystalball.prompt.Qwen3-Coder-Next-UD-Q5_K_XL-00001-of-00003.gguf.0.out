The clerk’s warning is a humorous misdirection: the “spirits” aren’t supernatural—they’re *alcoholic spirits*, and the crystal ball is likely a decorative bottle (e.g., a decanter or ornate liquor vessel), not a fortune-telling tool. The shop is an antique store, and “cover it” means *cover the bottle* to prevent spills or evaporation—not to ward off ghosts. [end of text]
