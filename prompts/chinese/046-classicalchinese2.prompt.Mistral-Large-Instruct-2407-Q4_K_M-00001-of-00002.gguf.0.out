 ### Translation

Wei Wuhou (魏武侯) was planning an event and made the right decisions, which none of his ministers could match. After the court session, he had a pleased expression on his face. Wu Qi (吳起) stepped forward and said, "Have you ever heard the words of Chu Zhuangwang (楚莊王) from his attendants?" Wuhou asked, "What were Chu Zhuangwang's words like?" Wu Qi replied, "Chu Zhuangwang planned an event and made the right decisions, which none of his ministers could match. After the court session, he had a worried expression. Shen Gong Wuchen (申公巫臣) stepped forward and asked, 'Why do you have a worried expression after the court session?' Zhuangwang said, 'I, the unworthy one, planned an event and made the right decisions, which none of my ministers could match. This is why I am worried. There is a saying in the middle of the Zong (中蘬) that goes: "A ruler who can find a teacher will become a king, one who can find a friend will become a hegemon, one who is doubted will survive, and one who plans alone and finds no one better than himself will perish." Now, with my lack of ability, and none of my ministers being able to match me, my country is on the verge of perishing! This is why I am worried.' Chu Zhuangwang was worried, but you are pleased." Wuhou, feeling ashamed, bowed twice and said, "Heaven has sent you, sir, to correct my mistakes."

### Moral of the Story

The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should not be overly confident in their own abilities but should seek the counsel and wisdom of others. A ruler who believes they are always right and does not have capable ministers to challenge or advise them is in danger of leading their state to ruin. Humility and the ability to recognize and rely on the talents of others are essential qualities for effective leadership.

### Counterpart in Western Thought

The concepts in this story have several counterparts in Western thought:

1. **Socratic Wisdom**: Socrates famously stated, "I know that I know nothing," emphasizing the importance of recognizing one's own limitations and seeking wisdom from others.

2. **Plato's Philosopher King**: In Plato's "Republic," the ideal ruler is a philosopher who seeks truth and wisdom, not just personal power or glory. This aligns with the idea that a ruler should be humble and seek the counsel of wise advisors.

3. **Machiavelli's Advice**: In "The Prince," Niccolò Machiavelli advises rulers to surround themselves with capable advisors and to listen to their counsel, although he also warns against relying too heavily on any single advisor.

4. **Leadership Theories**: Modern leadership theories, such as transformational leadership, emphasize the importance of humility, collaboration, and the ability to inspire and empower others.

These Western concepts share the underlying idea that effective leadership requires humility, the recognition of one's own limitations, and the ability to seek and utilize the wisdom and talents of others. [end of text]
