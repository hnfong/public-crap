[INST] This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

[/INST] 1. **Translation:**

Wei Wu Hou was planning an affair and made the right decision, which none of his ministers could match. After the court session, he had a pleased expression. Wu Qi stepped forward and said, "Have you ever heard the words of Chu Zhuang Wang from his attendants?" Wu Hou asked, "What were the words of Chu Zhuang Wang like?" Wu Qi replied, "Chu Zhuang Wang was planning an affair and made the right decision, which none of his ministers could match. After the court session, he had a worried expression. Shen Gong Wu Chen stepped forward and asked, 'Your Majesty has a worried expression after the court session, why is that?' Zhuang Wang said, 'I made the right decision in planning the affair, and none of my ministers could match it, that is why I am worried. As the saying goes, "A ruler who thinks he is the best strategist will perish; a ruler who relies on wise ministers will thrive." Now, with my lack of virtue, and none of my ministers being able to match me, my country is close to perishing! That is why I am worried.' Chu Zhuang Wang was worried about this, yet Your Majesty is pleased." Wu Hou, startled, bowed twice and said, "Heaven has sent you, sir, to correct my mistakes."

2. **Moral of the story:**

The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should not be proud or content when he finds that none of his ministers can match his wisdom. Instead, he should be worried, as this situation could lead to the downfall of his country. A good ruler should be surrounded by wise and capable ministers who can provide valuable counsel and help govern the country effectively.

3. **Counterpart in Western thought:**

The concepts in this story can be related to several ideas in Western thought:

- **Plato's philosopher king**: Plato argued that a just society should be ruled by philosopher kings, who are wise and virtuous. They should be surrounded by guardians who are also wise and well-educated.

- **Aristotle's politics**: Aristotle believed in the importance of collective wisdom and the value of deliberation among citizens. He argued that a good political system should involve many people in decision-making processes.

- **Machiavelli's advice on advisors**: In "The Prince," Machiavelli advises rulers to choose wise men for their cabinet and to give them the liberty to speak the truth.

- **The idea of checks and balances**: Modern democratic thought emphasizes the importance of checks and balances to prevent the concentration of power and ensure better decision-making. This story highlights the need for capable ministers to complement the ruler, which can be seen as a form of check and balance.
