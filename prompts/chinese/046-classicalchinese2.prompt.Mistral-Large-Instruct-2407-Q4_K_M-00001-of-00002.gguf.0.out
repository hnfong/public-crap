 ### Translation

Wei Wuhou (魏武侯) was planning an affair and made the right decision, but none of his ministers could match his wisdom. After the court session, he had a pleased expression on his face. Wu Qi (吳起) stepped forward and said, "Have you ever heard the words of Chu Zhuangwang (楚莊王) from his attendants?" Wuhou asked, "What were the words of Chu Zhuangwang?" Wu Qi replied, "Chu Zhuangwang planned an affair and made the right decision, but none of his ministers could match his wisdom. After the court session, he had a worried expression. Shen Gong Wuchen (申公巫臣) stepped forward and asked, 'Why do you have a worried expression after the court session?' Zhuangwang said, 'I, the unworthy one, planned an affair and made the right decision, but none of my ministers could match my wisdom. This is why I am worried. There is a saying in the middle of the Zong (蘬) book: "A ruler who can find a teacher will become a king, one who can find a friend will become a hegemon, one who is doubted will survive, and one who plans alone and finds no one better than himself will perish." Now, with my lack of ability, and none of my ministers being able to match my wisdom, my country is on the verge of perishing! This is why I am worried.' Chu Zhuangwang was worried, but you are pleased." Wuhou bowed twice and said, "Heaven has sent you, sir, to correct my mistakes."

### Moral of the Story

The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should not be overly pleased with their own wisdom but should instead be concerned if their ministers or advisors cannot match or surpass their wisdom. A ruler who relies solely on their own judgment without the benefit of wise counsel is in danger of making poor decisions that could lead to the downfall of their state. The story emphasizes the importance of humility and the value of having capable and wise advisors.

### Counterpart in Western (European) Thought

The concepts in the story have counterparts in Western thought, particularly in the realm of political philosophy and leadership theory. Here are a few examples:

1. **Plato's "Philosopher King":** In Plato's "The Republic," the ideal ruler is a philosopher who possesses wisdom and virtue. However, Plato also emphasizes the importance of the ruler being surrounded by wise advisors and the need for a well-educated and virtuous ruling class.

2. **Machiavelli's "The Prince":** Niccolò Machiavelli, in his work "The Prince," discusses the importance of a ruler having good advisors. He advises that a prince should choose wise men for his counsel and give them the freedom to speak their minds.

3. **Aristotle's "Politics":** Aristotle discusses the importance of collective wisdom and the role of advisors in governance. He argues that the collective judgment of many can be superior to that of a single individual, emphasizing the value of diverse perspectives.

These Western philosophers, like the Chinese thinkers, recognize the importance of a ruler being surrounded by wise and capable advisors to ensure effective governance and the well-being of the state. [end of text]
