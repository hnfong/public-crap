◁think▷Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. 

First, the summary. The story is about Ximen Bao, who was the magistrate of Ye during the time of King Wen of Wei. When he arrived, he found out that the people were suffering because of the practice of sacrificing girls to the River God, which was causing poverty. The local officials and shamans were extorting money for this ritual. Ximen Bao cleverly exposed and punished the shamans and officials by pretending to send a better girl and throwing them into the river instead. After that, he built irrigation channels which made the land fertile and the people prosperous. So the main points are the eradication of a harmful superstition, punishment of corrupt officials, and the introduction of beneficial infrastructure.

Next, the kind of women who were victims. The text mentions that the shamans would look for pretty young girls from poor families. These girls were then dressed up and thrown into the river as offerings. So the victims were young, attractive girls from poor households.

Who benefited from the old practice? The story says that the local elders, court clerks, and shamans collected money from the people. They used some for the ritual and kept the rest. So the beneficiaries were these officials and shamans who were exploiting the superstition for personal gain.

Regarding whether the protagonist used wits or force. Ximen Bao used a combination of both. He pretended to participate in the ritual, which allowed him to get close to the shamans and officials. Then, by declaring the girl was not pretty enough, he sent the shamans and officials into the river. This was a clever psychological move that exposed their fraud without needing physical force. So it's more about using intelligence and strategy.

Now, the morality of Ximen Bao's actions. From a utilitarian perspective, his actions saved many girls from being sacrificed and stopped the corruption, so the ends justify the means. From a deontological view, throwing innocent people into the river might be considered wrong, but in this case, the shamans and officials were guilty of murder and theft. So their punishment was just. However, some might argue that using deception is morally ambiguous. But given the context, Ximen Bao's actions were necessary to break the cycle of superstition and corruption.

The final question about the quote in 滑稽列传. The quote compares three virtuous officials: Zi Chan, Zi Jian, and Ximen Bao. Zi Chan's people couldn't deceive him, Zi Jian's people were unwilling to deceive, and Ximen Bao's people dared not. The question is who is the most virtuous. Each had a different approach. Zi Chan might have been wise and fair, making deception impossible. Zi Jian perhaps earned the people's respect so they didn't want to deceive him. Ximen Bao used fear initially but later provided benefits. The comment is fair in highlighting their different governing styles, but it's subjective to say which is best. However, Ximen Bao's long-lasting impact through irrigation suggests his methods were effective.
