(1) **English Translation:**

King Wǔhǔ of Wei planned a strategy that proved correct, and none of his ministers could match it. After leaving court, he showed a pleased expression. Wu Qi approached and said: "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu shared with your attendants?" 

The king replied: "What were King Zhuang of Chu's words like?" Wu Qi answered: "King Zhuang of Chu also planned a strategy that proved correct, and none of his ministers could match it. Yet after leaving court, he showed a worried expression. The minister Shēn Gōng Wǔ Chén approached and asked: 'Why do you show a worried expression after court?' The king said: 'I planned a strategy that proved correct, yet none of my ministers could match it, so I am worried. There is a saying in the middle of the court: "Those who have a teacher become kings, those who have friends become hegemon, those who have doubts survive, and those who plan for themselves and think no one can match them perish." Now, because of my unworthiness, and because my ministers cannot match me, our state is nearly doomed! That is why I am worried.' 

King Zhuang of Chu worried about this, yet you are pleased about it."

King Wǔhǔ hesitated, then bowed twice and said: "Heaven has sent you, Master, to correct my fault."

(2) **Moral of the Story:**

The moral is that true wisdom and leadership require humility and awareness of one's limitations. When a ruler becomes overly confident in their own abilities and believes they surpass their advisors, they risk becoming isolated and potentially doomed. The story emphasizes that a good leader should be troubled by their own success if it means their subordinates cannot match their wisdom, because this indicates a dangerous imbalance in the relationship between ruler and minister. The ideal ruler should be humble, recognizing that their success depends on the competence and loyalty of their advisors, not just their own superior intellect.

(3) **Western Counterpart Concepts:**

Yes, there are several parallels in Western thought:

- **Socratic Wisdom**: The Socratic principle that "I know that I know nothing" reflects similar humility in the face of knowledge and wisdom.

- **The "Sage-King" Tradition**: Similar to the Chinese concept, Western political philosophy has long emphasized the ideal of the wise ruler who governs through virtue and humility rather than mere intelligence or power.

- **"The Wisdom of the Crowd"**: The idea that collective wisdom surpasses individual genius, as seen in modern democratic theory and the concept of "groupthink" being dangerous.

- **Machiavelli's Warnings**: In "The Prince," Machiavelli warns rulers about the dangers of being too self-assured and not listening to advisors, though he approaches it more pragmatically.

- **The "Solitude of the Leader"**: Modern leadership theory recognizes that effective leaders must be aware of their own limitations and seek counsel, echoing the Chinese emphasis on humility and the dangers of unchecked pride.

The story's emphasis on humility before wisdom and the dangers of intellectual arrogance resonates with the Western philosophical tradition of recognizing human limitations and the importance of counsel and humility in leadership. [end of text]
