### Translation of the Story

**Original Passage:**
魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

**Translation:**
The Marquis of Wei (魏武侯) was skillful in planning and his strategies were excellent, but none of his ministers could match him. After leaving the court, he had a look of joy on his face. Wu Qi (吳起) approached and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu (楚莊王)?" The Marquis of Wei asked, "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?" Wu Qi replied, "King Zhuang of Chu was also skillful in planning, and none of his ministers could match him. However, after leaving the court, he had a look of worry on his face. Shen Gong Wuchen (申公巫臣) approached and asked, 'Why do you look worried after the court meeting?' King Zhuang replied, 'I am skillful in planning, but none of my ministers can match me, so I am worried. In the words of Zhong Kui (中蘬), 'A ruler who finds a teacher among his subjects will become a king; one who finds a friend will become a hegemon; one who finds someone to question will survive; but one who plans alone and finds no one equal to himself will perish.' Now, with my incompetence, none of my ministers can match me, so our country is close to perishing! That is why I am worried.' King Zhuang of Chu was worried, but you are joyful." The Marquis of Wei hesitated and bowed twice, saying, "Heaven sent you to correct my mistake."

### Moral of the Story

The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should not be overly confident in their own abilities, but should instead seek to cultivate a court where advisors and ministers can challenge and complement their own skills. The story contrasts the reactions of two rulers: one who is proud of his own abilities and celebrates his superiority over his ministers, and another who is concerned about the lack of capable advisors and the potential downfall of his country. The story suggests that true leadership involves humility and the recognition that one's success depends on the collective wisdom of the court.

### Western Counterpart

The concept in the story has a counterpart in Western thought, particularly in the ideas of **self-awareness** and **humility** in leadership. In Western philosophy, particularly in the works of thinkers like Socrates and later in the writings of Machiavelli, there is a recognition of the importance of self-awareness and the dangers of overconfidence. Socrates' famous statement, "The unexamined life is not worth living," echoes the idea that self-reflection and humility are crucial for leadership. Similarly, Machiavelli's "The Prince" discusses the importance of being aware of one's limitations and the need to surround oneself with capable advisors. The story of King Zhuang of Chu can be seen as a cautionary tale about the dangers of hubris and the importance of seeking wisdom from others, which aligns with these Western philosophical ideas.
