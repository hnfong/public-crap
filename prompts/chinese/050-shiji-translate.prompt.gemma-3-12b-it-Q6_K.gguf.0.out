《Zhang Shi Zhi Feng Tang Lie Zhuan》
Zhang Tingwei Shi Zhi, of Duyang, was his name, and his courtesy name was Ji. He had an elder brother, Zhong, who lived with him. He was appointed a cavalry attendant, serving Emperor Xiaowen, but for ten years he received no official assignment and achieved nothing of note. Shi Zhi said, “Long service has depleted Zhong’s inheritance; my ambitions are not fulfilled.” He wished to resign and return home. Yuan Ao, Grand Tutor, recognized his talent and regretted his departure, so he requested that Shi Zhi be transferred and appointed a palace attendant. After Shi Zhi had finished his morning audience, he took the opportunity to offer some advice. Emperor Wen said, “Humiliate him, do not praise him excessively, so that he can be put into practice now.” Then Shi Zhi spoke of events during the Qin and Han dynasties, explaining why Qin declined and Han prospered, over a long period. Emperor Wen praised him and appointed Shi Zhi as Attendant and Secretary.

Shi Zhi accompanied the expedition to Hutuquan. The Emperor asked about the records of the birds and beasts of Shanglin Park, posing more than ten questions. The attendants on either side of the Shanglin Park official were unable to answer. The Hutuquan tax collector stepped forward and answered the Emperor’s questions about the records of the birds and beasts very thoroughly. He wished to observe whether he could endlessly respond to questions. Emperor Wen said, “Should an official be like this? The official is lazy!” He then issued an edict appointing Shi Zhi as the Hutuquan and Shanglin Park Prefect. Previously, Shi Zhi had asked, “Your Majesty, how would you compare Hou Zhou of Qi and Hou Zhang of Dongyang?” The Emperor said, “They are both elderly.” He asked again, “How would you compare Hou Zhang of Dongyang and Hou Zhang?” The Emperor replied again, “They are both elderly.” Shi Zhi said, “Hou Zhou of Qi and Hou Zhang of Dongyang are called ‘elderly’ because they were unable to speak out on matters of state. How could this tax collector, with his eager mouth and quick responses, be like them? Moreover, during the Qin dynasty, officials were entrusted with knives and brushes, and officials competed to be hasty, severe, and meticulous, but this was merely a superficial display of learning, without genuine compassion. Therefore, their faults were not heard of, and they lingered until the Ershi period, when the earth crumbled. Now, Your Majesty appoints a tax collector based on his eloquence and promotes him, I fear that the world will follow the trend and compete for eloquence without substance. Furthermore, the lower classes imitate the upper classes, are eager for appearances, and mistakes cannot be carefully examined.” Emperor Wen said, “Well.” He then stopped the appointment of the tax collector.

The Emperor boarded his carriage and summoned Shi Zhi to participate in the procession, moving slowly, and asked Shi Zhi about the failings of the Qin dynasty. Shi Zhi explained the matter in detail. Upon arriving at the palace, the Emperor appointed Shi Zhi as the Public Carriage Official.

Shortly after, Prince Jian and King Liang traveled together in a carriage to court, bypassing the Sima Gate. At that time, Shi Zhi stopped Prince Jian and King Liang, preventing them from entering the palace gate. He then accused them of disrespecting the Public Gate and reported it. Empress Dowager Bo heard of it, and Emperor Wen removed his headdress and apologized, saying, “My son is not well-instructed.” Empress Dowager Bo then sent an emissary with an imperial edict to pardon Prince Jian and King Liang, after which they were allowed to enter. Emperor Wen was astonished by Shi Zhi and appointed him as a Central Grand Officer.

Shortly after, he became Grand Tutor. He accompanied the expedition to Baoling, residing near the northern latrine. At that time, Lady Shen was present, and the Emperor pointed out the new road to Fengyang to Lady Shen, saying, “This is the road to Handan.” He ordered Lady Shen to play the zither, and the Emperor leaned against the zither and sang, his expression sorrowful and filled with melancholy. He turned to the officials and said, “Alas! To use northern mountain rocks as a sarcophagus, to use hemp cloth to wrap the body, to apply lacquer in between, how can this be moved?” Everyone said, “Well.” Shi Zhi stepped forward and said, "If there is something desirable within, even if confined to Nanshan, there will still be a difficulty; if there is nothing desirable within, what sorrow is there even without a stone sarcophagus?" Emperor Wen praised him. Afterwards, Shi Zhi was appointed as the Tingwei.

Shortly after, the Emperor traveled out past Zhongwei Bridge, and a person emerged from under the bridge, startling the horses. The Emperor then ordered the cavalry patrol to investigate, assigning it to the Tingwei. Shi Zhi investigated the case. He said, “A county person came, heard the sound of hooves, and hid under the bridge. After a while, thinking the procession had passed, he emerged and saw the imperial carriage and horses, and then ran away.” According to the law, a person who startles a horse should be fined. Emperor Wen was angry and said, “This person startled my horse! My horse is gentle; other horses would certainly be injured! Yet the Tingwei is going to fine him!” Shi Zhi said, “The law is what the Son of Heaven shares with the world. If the law is like this and we add to it, the people will not trust the law. Moreover, at that time, if the Emperor had ordered the person to be executed, that would have been sufficient. Now that the case has been handed to the Tingwei, the Tingwei represents the peace of the world. If we overturn it, the laws of the world will be considered light or heavy, and the people will not know where to place their hands and feet. I only hope Your Majesty will consider this.” After a long silence, the Emperor said, “The Tingwei is correct.”

Afterwards, someone stole a jade ring from the front of the High Temple, and it was caught. Emperor Wen was angry and handed the case over to the Tingwei. Shi Zhi examined the law, which stated that stealing objects used by the former emperor was to be reported, and the report was to result in the item being sold in the market. The Emperor was greatly angered and said, “People are becoming depraved, stealing objects from the former emperor’s temple! I entrusted this to the Tingwei to punish him to the point of extermination, but you have reported it according to the law. This is not what I intended when I entrusted the temple to the Tingwei.” Shi Zhi removed his headdress and knelt to apologize, saying, “The law is as it is. Moreover, the crime is equal, but distinctions are made based on right and wrong. If stealing objects from the temple results in extermination, even if it is only a tenth of a percent, suppose ignorant people take a handful of earth from the Longling Mausoleum, how would Your Majesty apply the law to them?” After a long time, Emperor Wen spoke to the Empress Dowager about it, and it was agreed that the Tingwei should be allowed to do so. At that time, Zhongying, Marquis of Zhou Ya, and Liangxiang, Marquis of Wang Tian, who had heard Shi Zhi’s reasoned arguments, became close friends. Zhang Tingwei was thus praised throughout the world.

After Emperor Wen died and Emperor Jing ascended the throne, Shi Zhi was fearful and claimed illness. He wished to resign, fearing a great punishment; but he did not know how to request a farewell audience. He relied on Wang Sheng’s assistance and eventually received a farewell audience. Emperor Jing was merely indifferent.

Wang Sheng was skilled in the teachings of Huanglao and was a recluse. He had previously been summoned to live in the palace, and the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers all gathered to stand. Wang Sheng, an elderly man, said, “I understand,” and turned to Zhang Tingwei, saying, “Let us form a bond.” Shi Zhi knelt and formed the bond. After it was done, someone said to Wang Sheng, “Why do you humiliate Zhang Tingwei, making him kneel to form a bond?” Wang Sheng said, “I am old and insignificant, and I believe I will be of no benefit to Zhang Tingwei. Zhang Tingwei is now a famous minister in the world. Therefore, I deliberately humiliated Zhang Tingwei, making him kneel to form a bond, in order to honor him.” The officials heard this and praised Wang Sheng and respected Zhang Tingwei.

Zhang Tingwei served Emperor Jing for a few years and then became the Chancellor of Huainan, still retaining his previous opinions. After a long time, Shi Zhi died. His son was Zhang Zhi, whose courtesy name was Changgong, and who held the office of Grand Officer before resigning. He was unable to accommodate the people of the time, so he never entered public service.

Feng Tang was his paternal grandfather, from Zhao. His father moved to Dai. During the Han dynasty, he was moved to Anling. Tang was known for his filial piety and became the Director of the Middle Retinue, serving Emperor Wen. When Emperor Wen passed by, he asked Tang, “From where do the common people become attendants? Where is their home?” Tang truthfully reported it. Emperor Wen said, “When I lived in Dai, I still relied on Gao Pao to speak to me about the wisdom of Zhao’s general Li Qi, who fought at Julu. Now, every time I eat, I think of Julu.” Did your father know about this?” Tang replied, “It was no better than Lian Po and Li Mu as generals.” The Emperor said, “Why?” Tang said, “My paternal grandfather was an official [general] in Zhao, skilled in Li Mu. My father was formerly the Chancellor of Dai, knowing him to be a man of integrity.” Having heard of Lian Po and Li Mu, the Emperor said, “Alas! If only I had Lian Po and Li Mu as my generals, why should I worry about the Xiongnu?” Tang said, “Your Majesty! Even if you obtained Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them.” The Emperor was angry and returned to the Forbidden Palace. After a long time, he summoned Tang and said, “Why do you humiliate me, and have no place to rest?” Tang apologized, saying, “A humble person does not know about taboos.”

At that time, the Xiongnu newly entered the court, killing the Beidi Prefect. The Emperor was concerned about the barbarian invaders and again asked Tang, “How do you know that I cannot use Lian Po and Li Mu?” Tang replied, “I have heard that ancient kings, when sending out generals, would kneel and push the axle, saying, ‘The sphere within is controlled by the ruler; the sphere outside is controlled by the general.’ Military honors and rewards were decided externally and reported to the ruler. This is not empty talk. My paternal grandfather said that Li Mu, as a Zhao general on the border, used all the military rents for entertaining soldiers and rewarded decisions externally, without disturbing them from within. Entrusting them and demanding success, Li Mu was able to fully utilize his abilities, driving back the Xiongnu, defeating Donghu, destroying Danchen, and suppressing the strong Qin in the west, and restraining Han and Wei in the south. At that time, Zhao was nearly hegemonic. Later, when Zhao Wang Qian was established, his mother, Chuang, slandered him. When Wang Qian was established, he used Guo Kai’s slander to kill Li Mu and replace him with Yan Ju. As a result, the army was broken and the people of the north were captured by Qin and destroyed. Now, I have heard that Wei Shang, the Guardian of Yunzhong, uses all the military rents to entertain soldiers and officers, and gives private money, cutting an ox every five days to entertain guests, military officers, and attendants. Therefore, the Xiongnu avoid the Yunzhong area, not approaching it. The barbarians once entered, but Shang led the cavalry to attack them, killing many of them. These soldiers are all family members, rising from the fields to join the army, how can they know the regulations and symbols? They fight all day long, cutting off heads and capturing prisoners, and their merits are reported to the military office, but there is no correspondence. Clerks use the law to restrain them. The rewards are not carried out, and the officials strictly follow the law. I am foolish to think that Your Majesty’s law is too clear, the rewards are too light, and the punishments are too heavy. Moreover, Yunzhong Guardian Wei Shang was seated for a meritorious capture of barbarians and was reduced in rank by Your Majesty. Your Majesty’s lower officials reduced his nobility and made him work. From this, I say that even if Your Majesty obtains Lian Po and Li Mu, you will not be able to use them. I am truly foolish to touch a taboo and deserve the death penalty, the death penalty!” Emperor Wen said, “Well.” That day, he ordered Feng Tang to hold the seal and pardon Wei Shang, and to reinstate him as the Guardian of Yunzhong, and to appoint Tang as the Cavalry General, overseeing the Middle Officer and the county and national cavalry officers.

Seven years later, Emperor Jing ascended the throne and appointed Tang as the Chancellor of Chu, and then relieved him of his duties. Emperor Wu ascended the throne and sought talented people, recommending Feng Tang. Tang was then over ninety years old and could not resume office, so his son, Feng Sui, was appointed as a Lang. Sui’s courtesy name was Wangsun, and he was also a talented man, and was friendly with Yu Shen.

The Grand Historian says: Zhang Ji’s words about the ‘elderly’ maintain principles without being swayed by opinions; Feng Gong’s discussion of generals has meaning. It has meaning! It is said, “If you do not know a person, look at their friends.” The things praised by these two gentlemen can be inscribed on the palace walls. The Book says, “Not partial, not biased, the kingly way is all-encompassing; not biased, not partial, the kingly way is straightforward.” Zhang Ji and Feng Gong are close to this. [end of text]
