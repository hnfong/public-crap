Alright, I need to answer this question about "The Romance of the Three Kingdoms" (not the dramatized version). The question is asking about a general in the Shuhan camp who, despite having weaker forces, decided to evacuate the camp to confuse the enemy and implement the "empty camp strategy." I need to identify this general and provide a brief explanation.

First, I recall that the "empty camp strategy" is a classic military tactic where a general feigns retreat or weakness to deceive the enemy, making them believe that the defending forces are weak or in disarray. This can lead the enemy to underestimate the true strength of the defending side and possibly make mistakes in their strategy.

In "The Romance of the Three Kingdoms," there are several instances where generals use strategic retreats or feigned weaknesses to deceive the enemy. One prominent example that comes to mind is the Battle of Red Cliffs. However, that battle involved the combined forces of Shu, Wu, and others against Cao Cao's massive army. It might not be the best fit for this specific question.

Another instance is the Battle of Changbanpo, where Zhang Fei used his reputation and the appearance of a small force to intimidate the pursuing enemy, allowing his troops to escape safely. But again, this might not directly involve the "empty camp strategy" as described.

Thinking further, I recall that Zhuge Liang, the renowned strategist of Shuhan, was known for his clever use of tactics and feints. Perhaps he implemented the "empty camp strategy" at some point. However, I need to confirm if there's a specific instance where a general, possibly under Zhuge Liang's command, used this strategy.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up different battles. Let me think of a specific general who used the "empty camp strategy." Ah, there's the story of Guan Yu during the Battle of Fancheng. Guan Yu, with a smaller force, decided to evacuate his camp to lure the enemy into a false sense of security, making them believe he was retreating. This strategy worked, and the enemy pursued, leading to Guan Yu's eventual victory.

But I need to verify if this aligns with the question. The question specifies that the general decided to evacuate the camp to confuse the enemy and implement the "empty camp strategy" while having weaker forces. Guan Yu's action during the Battle of Fancheng fits this description well.

Alternatively, there's also the story of Zhang Fei at the Battle of Changbanpo, where he used his reputation and the appearance of a small force to intimidate the enemy, allowing his troops to escape. This could also be considered an "empty camp strategy."

Given the options, I think the most fitting answer is Guan Yu during the Battle of Fancheng. He demonstrated the "empty camp strategy" by evacuating his camp to deceive the enemy, showcasing his strategic prowess despite being outnumbered.
