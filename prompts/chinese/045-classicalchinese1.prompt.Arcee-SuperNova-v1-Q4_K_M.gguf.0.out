Here are the answers to the questions:

**Q1: Summary (5 points)**
West Gate Officer Ximen Bao, as the governor of Ye, discovered that the local officials and shamans were exploiting the people by claiming that the River God needed a wife, and would take a girl from a poor family, only to pocket the money meant for the ritual. Ximen Bao cleverly tricked the officials and shamans into being thrown into the river, and then used the opportunity to implement a new irrigation system that benefited the people.

**Q2: Victims (2 points)**
The victims were usually young girls from poor families, often considered beautiful.

**Q3: Beneficiaries (2 points)**
The local officials, shamans, and their associates were the ones who benefited from the old practice, by embezzling the money meant for the ritual.

**Q4: Method (5 points)**
Ximen Bao used his wits to deal with the situation, by pretending to go along with the ritual and then turning the tables on the officials and shamans. He did not use force, but rather cleverly manipulated the situation to achieve his goal.

**Q5: Morality (10 points)**
From a utilitarian perspective, Ximen Bao's actions can be seen as moral, as they ultimately benefited the greater good of the people. From a deontological perspective, however, his actions can be seen as morally questionable, as he used deception and trickery to achieve his goals. From a cultural relativist perspective, Ximen Bao's actions can be seen as a necessary evil, given the corrupt and exploitative nature of the old practice. Overall, the morality of Ximen Bao's actions is open to interpretation.

**Q6: Comment (15 points)**
The comment at the end of the story compares Ximen Bao to two other wise officials, Zichan and Zixi, and suggests that Ximen Bao's approach was the most effective in preventing exploitation. The comment implies that Ximen Bao's method was not just about punishing the corrupt officials, but also about creating a culture of fearlessness and honesty among the people. The comment is fair in that it highlights Ximen Bao's innovative approach to governance, but it can also be seen as biased towards Ximen Bao's methods, which some might view as heavy-handed or manipulative.
