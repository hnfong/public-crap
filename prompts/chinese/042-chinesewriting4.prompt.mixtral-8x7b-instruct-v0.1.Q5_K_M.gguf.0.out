 [/INST] From the perspective of a high school student or a neutral observer, both views regarding keeping promises and giving up on them have their own merits, and the appropriateness of each action depends on the specific context and circumstances.

On one hand, adhering to commitments can be seen as a manifestation of integrity and trustworthiness. By honoring one's promises, an individual demonstrates reliability, strengthening their relationships and credibility with others. When people consistently keep their promises, it fosters a sense of stability and mutual respect in both personal and professional settings. In this view, steadfastness in promises reflects responsibility and maturity.

On the other hand, there are instances where abandoning a commitment might be the more accountable course of action. For example, if an individual has overcommitted themselves or encounters unforeseen obstacles, it may be unwise or even impossible to follow through on a promise. In such cases, recognizing and admitting the inability to fulfill a commitment can be a sign of emotional intelligence and self-awareness. By releasing oneself from an unrealistic or impractical promise, one can prevent further stress, burnout, and potential damage to their reputation. This action, too, can be seen as a form of responsibility.

Therefore, the decision to keep or break a promise should take into account factors such as the nature of the commitment, the impact of fulfillment, and the individual's capacity to deliver. It is essential to balance the importance of upholding one's word with the potential consequences of failing to meet expectations. A nuanced and thoughtful approach to promises allows individuals to maintain their integrity while also acknowledging the complexities and unpredictability of life.</s>
