(1) Translation:

King Wu of Wei had made a good decision, and none of his ministers could match his wisdom. After the court session, he had a pleased expression on his face. Wu Qi approached and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu?" King Wu asked, "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?" Wu Qi replied, "King Zhuang of Chu had made a good decision, and none of his ministers could match his wisdom. After the court session, he had a worried expression on his face. Shen Gong Wuchen asked, 'Your Majesty, why do you look worried after the court session?' King Zhuang replied, 'I made a good decision, and none of my ministers could match my wisdom, which is why I am worried. As Zhong Qiong said, 'A ruler who finds a teacher among the feudal lords will become a king, one who finds a friend will become a hegemon, one who finds a skeptic will survive, and one who makes decisions alone and thinks no one can match him will perish.' Now, with my lack of talent, and none of my ministers can match my wisdom, our country is almost doomed! That's why I am worried.' King Zhuang was worried, but you are happy."

King Wu of Wei hesitated and bowed twice, saying, "Heaven has sent you to correct my mistake."

(2) Moral of the story:

The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should not be pleased when their decisions are unmatched by their ministers, but rather worried. This is because a ruler who thinks they are unmatched in wisdom may become arrogant and isolated, leading to their downfall. The story emphasizes the importance of humility, seeking advice from others, and recognizing the value of diverse perspectives in governance.

(3) Counterpart in Western thought:

The concepts in this story have counterparts in Western thought, particularly in the ideas of humility, the value of diverse perspectives, and the dangers of arrogance. In Western philosophy, thinkers like Aristotle emphasized the importance of humility and seeking wisdom from others. The concept of the "wise ruler" who listens to advice and considers multiple perspectives can be found in works like Plato's "Republic" and Machiavelli's "The Prince." The idea that a ruler who thinks they are unmatched in wisdom may become arrogant and isolated is also present in Western political thought, as seen in the concept of the "tyrannical ruler" in ancient Greek and Roman literature. Overall, the story's moral aligns with the Western philosophical tradition that values humility, wisdom, and the importance of diverse perspectives in governance. [end of text]
