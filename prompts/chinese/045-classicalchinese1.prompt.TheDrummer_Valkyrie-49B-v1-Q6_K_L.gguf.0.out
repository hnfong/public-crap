Q1: Summary (5 points)
The story tells of West Gate General Xi Men Fei, who served as the prefect of Ye during the reign of Wei Wen Hou. Upon arriving in Ye, Xi Men Fei discovered that the local officials and elders would annually extort money from the people to "marry off" the River God, using the funds for their own gain. Xi Men Fei put an end to this practice by pretending to want to send a more beautiful girl, then drowning the old shaman and her disciples in the river. He then ordered the construction of 12 canals to irrigate the land, greatly benefiting the people.

Q2: Victims (2 points)
The victims were usually young girls from poor families, especially those with attractive daughters who were feared to be taken by the shaman.

Q3: Beneficiaries (2 points)
The beneficiaries were the three elders, the shaman, and her disciples who shared the extorted money.

Q4: Xi Men Fei's approach (5 points)
Xi Men Fei used a combination of wits and force. He first feigned interest in the practice to gain the trust of the elders and shaman. Then, he used force by drowning the shaman and her disciples in the river to put an end to the practice.

Q5: Morality (10 points)
- From a utilitarian perspective, Xi Men Fei's actions were moral as they led to the greater good of the people by stopping the exploitation and providing irrigation.
- From a deontological perspective, drowning people is morally wrong regardless of the outcome.
- From a cultural perspective, Xi Men Fei's actions were seen as wise and beneficial, as evidenced by the lasting impact of his irrigation system.

Q6: Comment analysis (15 points)
The comment compares Xi Men Fei's governance to that of two other historical figures, Zi Chan and Zi Xian. It states that under Zi Chan, people couldn't cheat; under Zi Xian, people wouldn't cheat; and under Xi Men Fei, people dared not cheat. The comment suggests that Xi Men Fei's method of governance was the most effective in preventing cheating and corruption.

The fairness of this comment can be debated:
- Xi Men Fei's use of force and deception to eliminate corruption was indeed effective in the short term.
- However, it may not have addressed the root causes of corruption or fostered a culture of honesty.
- In contrast, Zi Chan and Zi Xian's methods may have been more sustainable and ethical in the long run.

Ultimately, the comment highlights the complexity of governance and the need for a nuanced approach to evaluating historical figures' methods. [end of text]
