## Answers to 滑稽列传 Questions:

**Q1: Short Summary (5 points)**

Westmen Bao, as magistrate of Ye, discovered the local elders, officials, and shamans extorted money from the people under the guise of "marrying" girls to the River God (He Bo). These girls were forced into a ritual drowning. Bao lured the perpetrators to the river, then systematically drowned the elders, shamans, and their disciples, terrifying the populace into abandoning the practice. He then implemented irrigation canals, benefiting the people and solidifying his reputation.

**Q2: Victims (2 points)**

Young, attractive women were the usual victims, selected by the shamans for their beauty. The story explicitly mentions "good-looking girls" being targeted.

**Q3: Beneficiaries (2 points)**

The elders (三老), court officials (廷掾), and shamans (巫祝) profited from the extortion. They collected money from the people, used a portion for the ritual, and kept the rest.

**Q4: Wits vs. Force (5 points)**

The protagonist primarily used **force, disguised with calculated deception**. He didn't argue or negotiate; he lured the perpetrators into a trap and brutally executed them. The initial "request" to see the girl was a pretense to justify the violence. While cunning in setting the trap, the method was overwhelmingly violent.

**Q5: Morality (10 points)**

*   **Utilitarian:** Morally justifiable if the ends (ending extortion, providing irrigation) outweigh the brutal means. The long-term benefit to the people justifies the short-term violence.
*   **Deontological:** Highly immoral. Murdering people, even corrupt ones, is inherently wrong, regardless of the outcome. The means do not justify the ends.
*   **Virtue Ethics:** Depends on the virtues prioritized. If ruthlessness and effectiveness are valued, it's justifiable. If compassion and justice are prioritized, it's deeply unethical.
*   **Modern Legal/Ethical:** Clearly illegal and unethical. Extrajudicial killings are unacceptable.

**Q6: The Final Comment (15 points)**

The quote states: "It is said: 'Zi Chan governed Zheng, and the people could not deceive him; Zi Jian governed Danfu, and the people did not dare deceive him; Westmen Bao governed Ye, and the people did not dare deceive him.' Of these three, whose talent is the greatest? A discerning ruler must be able to distinguish."

This means that all three rulers effectively suppressed deception in their domains, but through different methods. Zi Chan achieved it through strict laws and enforcement, Zi Jian through moral persuasion, and Westmen Bao through sheer terror.

The comment is **unfair**. While Bao was effective, his method was based on fear, not genuine governance. Zi Chan and Zi Jian inspired respect or fear through legitimate authority, while Bao relied on brutality. The comment implies that effectiveness alone defines a good ruler, ignoring the ethical implications of Bao's methods. A truly discerning ruler would recognize that lasting stability comes from justice, not just intimidation. The comment prioritizes results over morality, which is a flawed assessment.
