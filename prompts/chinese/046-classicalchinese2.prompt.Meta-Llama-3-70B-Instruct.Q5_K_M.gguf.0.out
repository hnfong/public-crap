This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

Here are the requested answers:

**(1) Translation:**

Wei Wu Hou was planning a matter and succeeded, but none of his ministers could match him. He retired from court with a joyful expression. Wu Qi stepped forward and asked, "Have you ever heard the story of Chu Zhuang Wang's words, which were told to those around him?" Wu Hou asked, "What were Chu Zhuang Wang's words like?" Wu Qi replied, "Chu Zhuang Wang planned a matter and succeeded, but none of his ministers could match him. He retired from court with a worried expression. Shen Gong Wu Chen stepped forward and asked, 'Why do you have a worried expression, Your Majesty?' Chu Zhuang Wang said, 'I worry because I planned a matter and succeeded, but none of my ministers could match me. This is a saying among the wise: "Those who gain a teacher will become kings, those who gain friends will become hegemons, those who gain doubts will survive, and those who plan alone with no one to match them will perish." Now, I worry that my country is on the verge of perishing because I, an unworthy ruler, have no one to match me!' Chu Zhuang Wang worried, but you, my lord, are joyful." Wu Hou was deeply moved, bowed twice, and said, "Heaven has sent you, sir, to correct my mistakes."

**(2) Moral of the story:**

The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should be worried if they have no one to match their abilities or provide constructive criticism. This is because a ruler who has no one to challenge them may become complacent and make poor decisions, leading to the downfall of their country. On the other hand, a ruler who has capable advisors and is open to feedback is more likely to make wise decisions and ensure the prosperity of their country.

**(3) Counterparts in Western thought:**

The concept of the importance of having advisors and critics to provide feedback to a ruler has counterparts in Western thought. For example:

* In Plato's "The Republic," Socrates argues that a just society requires a philosopher-king who is advised by a council of wise and knowledgeable individuals.
* In Aristotle's "Politics," he emphasizes the importance of having a mixed constitution, where power is divided among different branches of government, to prevent the concentration of power and ensure accountability.
* In modern Western thought, the concept of "checks and balances" in government is based on the idea that no one branch of government should have too much power, and that there should be mechanisms in place to prevent abuse of power.

The idea that a ruler should be humble and recognize their own limitations is also a common theme in Western thought, such as in the concept of "servant leadership" or the idea that a leader should be a "first among equals."

The specific phrase "those who gain a teacher will become kings, those who gain friends will become hegemons, those who gain doubts will survive, and those who plan alone with no one to match them will perish" has no direct counterpart in Western thought, but it is reminiscent of the idea that "pride goes before a fall" or that "absolute power corrupts absolutely."<|eot_id|>
