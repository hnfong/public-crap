(1) Translation into English:

Wei Wuhou was deliberating on state affairs and made an appropriate decision; none of his ministers could match his insight. After the court session, he wore a look of satisfaction. Wu Qi stepped forward and asked: “Have you ever heard the words of Chu Zhuangwang on this matter?”  
Wuhou asked: “What did Chu Zhuangwang say?”  
Wu Qi replied: “When Chu Zhuangwang made a wise decision and none of his ministers could match him, he returned from court with a look of concern. Shen Gong Wu Chen asked him: ‘Why do you look troubled after making a wise decision?’  
Chu Zhuangwang replied: ‘When I make a decision and none of my ministers can match me, I fear my state is nearing ruin. As it is said in the ancient texts: “A ruler who gains a teacher will rule as a king; who gains a friend will become a hegemon; who gains a challenger will survive; but he who relies solely on his own judgment and finds no one equal to him will perish.” Now, I, though unworthy, have made a decision that none of my ministers can match — my state is nearly doomed! That is why I am troubled.’  
Now, you, my lord, are pleased — while Chu Zhuangwang was troubled.”  
Wu Hou, after a moment of hesitation, bowed twice and said: “Heaven has sent you, Master Wu Qi, to correct my fault.”

(2) Moral of the story:

The moral is that true wisdom in leadership lies not in being the most brilliant or decisive individual, but in surrounding oneself with capable, critical, and equal-minded advisors — people who can challenge, refine, and even surpass one’s own thinking. A ruler who is pleased because no one can match his wisdom is in grave danger: his isolation signals the absence of critical feedback, which is essential for wise governance. True strength lies not in being the smartest person in the room, but in cultivating a circle of capable, honest, and challenging advisors. The ruler who is complacent in his superiority is on the path to ruin; the wise ruler is troubled by his own limitations and seeks out those who can surpass him.

This is a profound Confucian and Xunzi-era ideal: leadership is not about personal brilliance, but about moral humility, the cultivation of talent, and the willingness to be challenged. As Xunzi himself emphasized, the sage ruler is one who “learns from others” and “does not rely on his own wisdom alone.”

(3) Do the concepts in the story have a counterpart in Western (European) thought?

Yes, absolutely. The core ideas in this story resonate strongly with several key traditions in Western political and philosophical thought:

1. **Aristotelian Virtue Ethics and the “Phronimos” (Practical Wisdom)**:  
   Aristotle emphasized that the wise ruler (the *phronimos*) does not rely on solitary wisdom but cultivates a community of virtuous citizens and advisors. The wise leader knows his own limitations and seeks counsel — a direct parallel to Chu Zhuangwang’s humility.

2. **Plato’s “Philosopher-King” and the Role of Dialogue**:  
   In Plato’s *Republic*, the ideal ruler is not one who imposes his will, but one who engages in dialectic — constant questioning and dialogue with wise interlocutors. The idea that truth emerges through dialogue and that the ruler must be open to challenge mirrors Chu Zhuangwang’s humility.

3. **Medieval and Renaissance Political Thought — “The Prince” and the “Counselor”**:  
   Machiavelli’s *The Prince* (1513) famously warns rulers against flatterers and emphasizes the need for honest advisors — even if their counsel is unpleasant. He writes: “A wise prince ought to have a mind so constructed that he can turn it to whatever is required by circumstances, and yet not deviate from what is good.” He also warns that rulers who surround themselves only with sycophants are doomed — a direct parallel to Wu Qi’s rebuke.

4. **Enlightenment Thought — Kant and the Public Use of Reason**:  
   Immanuel Kant’s famous essay “What is Enlightenment?” (1784) urges individuals — including rulers — to “have the courage to use your own reason,” but also to engage in public discourse and tolerate criticism. The ideal ruler, for Kant, is one who fosters an environment of open debate — precisely what Chu Zhuangwang embodies by being troubled when no one can challenge him.

5. **Modern Democratic Theory — The “Marketplace of Ideas”**:  
   In modern liberal democracies, the idea that truth emerges from open debate, dissent, and competition of ideas (John Stuart Mill’s *On Liberty*) is foundational. A leader who silences dissent or is surrounded only by yes-men is seen as dangerously isolated — exactly the warning Wu Qi gives to Wei Wuhou.

**Conclusion**:  
Yes, the core concepts in this story — the danger of intellectual isolation, the virtue of humility in leadership, the necessity of dissenting voices, and the idea that true wisdom lies in being troubled by one’s own isolation — are deeply resonant in Western political and philosophical traditions. From Aristotle and Cicero to Machiavelli, Kant, and John Stuart Mill, the Western canon repeatedly warns that the greatest danger to a ruler is not external enemies, but internal intellectual isolation and the absence of honest critics. Wu Qi’s rebuke to Wei Wuhou is not merely a Confucian insight — it is a universal truth about leadership, echoed across civilizations. [end of text]
