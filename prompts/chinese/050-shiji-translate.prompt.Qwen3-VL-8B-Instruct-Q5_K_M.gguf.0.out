The Biography of Zhang Shizi and Feng Tang

Zhang, the Grand Judge Shizi, was from Duyang, and his courtesy name was Ji. He lived with his elder brother Zhong. He became a cavalry attendant by virtue of his family’s wealth, serving Emperor Xiaowen. For ten years he remained un-promoted, and was not known. Shizi said: “Long service reduces my brother’s wealth; I shall not succeed.” He wished to resign and return home. The Middle Commander Yuan Ang, recognizing his talent, regretted his departure, and thus requested that Shizi be transferred to serve as a petitioner. After Shizi had finished his court duties, he stepped forward and spoke of practical matters. Emperor Xiaowen said: “Keep it simple; do not offer overly lofty theories, but make sure what you say can be implemented now.” Thus Shizi spoke at length about events between the Qin and Han dynasties, explaining why Qin had fallen and Han had risen. Emperor Xiaowen praised him, and appointed him as Chief Petitioner.

Shizi accompanied the emperor on a tour, and they ascended the tiger enclosure. The emperor asked the Forest Keeper about the records of various animals, posing over a dozen questions. The Keeper looked around nervously and could not answer any. The tiger enclosure supervisor stepped in and answered the emperor’s questions thoroughly, hoping to demonstrate his ability to respond instantly and fluently. Emperor Xiaowen said: “Is this not how officials should behave? The Keeper is a scoundrel!” He then ordered Shizi to appoint the supervisor as Forest Keeper. Shizi stepped forward and said: “Your Majesty, how do you regard General Zhou Bo, the Duke of Jiahou?” The emperor replied: “He is a gentleman.” Shizi then asked: “What about the Duke of Dongyang, Zhang Xiang?” The emperor again replied: “He is a gentleman.” Shizi said: “Both the Duke of Jiahou and the Duke of Dongyang are called gentlemen, yet neither could utter a word when speaking on matters. How can this supervisor, who speaks fluently and quickly, be compared to them? Moreover, Qin fell because it relied on scribes and clerks, who competed to be the most diligent, meticulous, and quick, yet their only result was empty formalities without genuine compassion. Thus, Qin’s faults went unnoticed, and it gradually declined until the Second Emperor, and the whole world collapsed. Now, Your Majesty promotes this supervisor merely for his eloquence, and I fear the whole world will follow suit, competing for eloquence without substance. Moreover, the influence of the lower ranks on the upper ranks is faster than the echo of a bell; therefore, your decisions must be carefully considered.” Emperor Xiaowen said: “Well said.” He thus stopped the appointment.

The emperor got into the carriage and summoned Shizi to ride as his companion. They traveled slowly, and the emperor asked Shizi about the failings of Qin. Shizi answered fully and honestly. Upon reaching the palace, the emperor appointed Shizi as the Director of the Public Vehicle Office.

Soon afterward, the Crown Prince and Prince Liang rode together into court, but did not dismount at the gatekeeper’s post. Shizi pursued them and stopped them from entering the palace gate. He then charged them with disrespect for not dismounting at the gate, and submitted a report. Empress Dowager Bo heard of this, and Emperor Xiaowen removed his crown and apologized: “I failed to teach my son properly.” Empress Dowager Bo then sent an envoy to pardon the Crown Prince and Prince Liang, allowing them to enter. Emperor Xiaowen thus admired Shizi and appointed him as a Middle Doctor.

Soon afterward, Shizi became a Middle Commander. On a tour to Baling, they stopped near a latrine. At that time, Shenzhu followed the emperor. The emperor pointed to the road to Xinfeng and said: “This is the road to Handan.” He had Shenzhu play the qin, and he himself leaned on the qin and sang, his mood sad and melancholy. He turned to the courtiers and said: “Alas! If one were to bury oneself in northern mountain stone, and use hemp cloth to fill the coffin, and lacquer the gaps, how could it be moved?” Everyone around said: “That is correct.” Shizi stepped forward and said: “If there is something desirable within, even if locked in the southern mountains, there would still be a crack; if there is nothing desirable within, even without a stone coffin, why should one be sad?” Emperor Xiaowen praised him. Later, he appointed Shizi as Grand Judge.

Soon afterward, the emperor was traveling out from the Middle Wei Bridge, when a man ran out from under the bridge, startling the imperial carriage horses. The emperor ordered cavalry to arrest him and hand him over to the Grand Judge. Shizi interrogated him. The man said: “I am from a county, heard the imperial procession, hid under the bridge. After a long time, I thought the procession had passed, so I came out and saw the imperial carriage and horses, and ran away.” The Grand Judge Qin judged him guilty of violating the imperial procession, and sentenced him to a fine. Emperor Xiaowen was angry and said: “This man personally startled my horse. My horse is gentle and docile; if it had been another horse, surely it would have injured me. Yet the Grand Judge sentences him only to a fine!” Shizi replied: “The law is something the emperor shares with the whole world. If the law is now changed to impose a heavier penalty, then the law will not be trusted by the people. Moreover, at that time, if the emperor had ordered immediate execution, it would have been fine. But now that he has been handed over to the Grand Judge, the Grand Judge is the arbiter of justice for the whole world. If one case is wrongly judged, then all future legal judgments will be perceived as arbitrary and inconsistent, and the people will not know where to place their hands or feet. Please, Your Majesty, consider this carefully.” After a long time, the emperor said: “The Grand Judge’s judgment is correct.”

Later, someone stole a jade ring from in front of the High Temple altar. He was captured, and Emperor Xiaowen was angry, ordering the Grand Judge to investigate. Shizi cited the law: stealing sacrificial items from the ancestral temple should be punished by execution. The emperor was furious and said: “People who act so unrighteously steal the sacrificial items of our late emperor. I have entrusted you with the case, expecting you to sentence them to death, yet you merely apply the law. This is not what I intended when I established the ancestral temple.” Shizi removed his hat and bowed deeply, apologizing: “The law is sufficient as it is. Moreover, the crime is the same, yet the severity depends on whether it is rebellious or not. If stealing sacrificial items from the ancestral temple results in execution, then even if one in ten thousand people steals a handful of soil from the Long陵, what punishment should be imposed?” After a long time, Emperor Xiaowen discussed the matter with Empress Dowager Bo, and finally agreed with the Grand Judge’s judgment. At that time, the Commander-in-Chief Zhou Yafu and the Chancellor of Liang, Wang Tianshuai, admired Shizi’s balanced judgment, and thus became close friends. Zhang, the Grand Judge, was thus praised throughout the land.

After Emperor Xiaowen’s death, Emperor Jing ascended the throne. Shizi feared, claimed illness, and wished to resign, fearing severe punishment; yet he also hesitated to apologize, not knowing how to proceed. Following the advice of Wang Sheng, he finally went to apologize, but Emperor Jing did not punish him.

Wang Sheng was a man skilled in the Yellow and Lao philosophy, a recluse. He was once summoned to court, where all the Three Excellencies and Nine Ministers gathered. Wang Sheng, an old man, said: “My sandals have come undone.” He turned to Zhang, the Grand Judge, and said: “Please tie my sandals for me!” Shizi knelt and tied them. Afterward, someone told Wang Sheng: “Why did you humiliate Zhang, the Grand Judge, in court, making him kneel to tie your sandals?” Wang Sheng replied: “I am old and lowly, and I judged that I would not benefit Zhang, the Grand Judge. Zhang is now a renowned minister of the land; thus, I deliberately humiliated him, making him kneel to tie my sandals, to elevate his status.” When the ministers heard this, they admired Wang Sheng and held Zhang, the Grand Judge, in high esteem.

Zhang, the Grand Judge, served Emperor Jing for over a year, and became the Chancellor of the Prince of Huainan, still fearing his past mistakes. After a long time, Shizi died. His son was named Zhang Zhi, courtesy name Changgong, who rose to the rank of Doctor, but was later dismissed. He could not win favor with the contemporary court, and thus never held office again.

Feng Tang, whose great-grandfather was from Zhao, and whose father moved to Dai. After the Han dynasty’s founding, the family moved to Anling. Feng Tang was renowned for his filial piety, serving as a Middle Commander’s Clerk, and served Emperor Xiaowen. When the emperor passed by in his carriage, he asked Feng Tang: “How did you become a clerk? Where is your home?” Feng Tang answered truthfully. Emperor Xiaowen said: “When I was in Dai, my food supervisor Gao Qu often told me about the excellence of Zhao general Li Qi, who fought at Julu. Every time I eat, I think of Julu.” Feng Tang replied: “He is not as good as General Lian Po or Li Mu.” The emperor asked: “Why?” Feng Tang replied: “My great-grandfather, when serving in Zhao, was a commander (soldier), and admired Li Mu. My father, formerly the governor of Dai, admired Zhao general Li Qi, and knew his character.” After hearing about Lian Po and Li Mu, the emperor was pleased and pounded his thighs, saying: “Alas! I alone cannot have Lian Po and Li Mu as my generals; then I would not worry about the Huns!” Feng Tang replied: “Your Majesty, even if you obtain Lian Po and Li Mu, you will not be able to use them.” The emperor became angry and entered the palace. After a long time, he summoned Feng Tang and scolded him: “Why do you publicly humiliate me? Is there no private place for you?” Feng Tang apologized: “I am a simpleton, ignorant of propriety.”

At that time, the Huns had recently invaded Chao’na, killing the Northern Border Commander Wang. The emperor was concerned about the Huns, and finally asked Feng Tang again: “How do you know I cannot use Lian Po and Li Mu?” Feng Tang replied: “I have heard that in ancient times, kings sent generals by kneeling and pushing the chariot, saying: ‘Within the gate, I control; outside the gate, the general controls.’ Military merit, rank, and rewards were decided outside, and then reported back. This is not empty talk. My great-grandfather said that Li Mu, as general of Zhao, stationed at the border, collected the market taxes to reward his soldiers, and rewards and punishments were decided outside, without interference from the central court. He was entrusted with responsibility and held accountable for success, so Li Mu was able to fully utilize his talents, selecting 1,300 chariots, 13,000 cavalry, and ten thousand men who received a hundred gold rewards, thus driving the Xiongnu north, defeating Donghu, destroying Danlin, restraining the powerful Qin to the west, and supporting Han and Wei to the south. At that time, Zhao nearly became a hegemon. Later, when King Zhao Xuan ascended the throne, his mother was a courtesan. After King Zhao Xuan ascended the throne, he used Guo Kai’s slander, ultimately executing Li Mu and appointing Yan Ju to replace him. Thus, the army was defeated, and the soldiers fled north, and Zhao was destroyed by Qin. Now I have heard that Wei Shang, the governor of Yunzhong, used all the market taxes to reward his soldiers, and privately funded feasts, slaughtering a cow every five days to entertain guests, officers, and servants, so the Huns avoided Yunzhong’s border. When the Huns once invaded, Wei Shang led his chariots and cavalry to attack them, killing many of their soldiers. The soldiers were all commoners, rising from the fields to join the army, and did not know the regulations of military records. They fought all day, killing enemies and capturing prisoners, but when reporting their merits to the office, their reports did not match the records, and the clerks punished them by law. Their rewards were not given, yet the clerks strictly enforced the law. I am foolish, and believe that Your Majesty’s laws are too strict, rewards too light, and punishments too heavy. Moreover, Wei Shang, the governor of Yunzhong, was punished for failing to report six levels of merit, and was demoted and punished. From this, I believe that even if Your Majesty obtains Lian Po and Li Mu, you will not be able to use them. I am truly foolish, and have offended your majesty; I beg for death, death!” Emperor Xiaowen was pleased. That day, he ordered Feng Tang to hold the imperial seal and pardon Wei Shang, restoring him as governor of Yunzhong, and appointed Feng Tang as the Commander of the Carriage Cavalry, in charge of the Commander-in-Chief and the cavalry of the various commanderies.

In the seventh year, Emperor Jing ascended the throne, appointing Feng Tang as Chancellor of Chu, but he was later dismissed. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne, he sought virtuous men, and recommended Feng Tang. Feng Tang was then over ninety years old and could no longer serve as an official. Instead, he appointed Feng Su, Feng Tang’s son, as a clerk. Feng Su, courtesy name Wangsun, was also an extraordinary man, and was friendly with me.

The historian says: Zhang Ji’s words reflect the character of a gentleman, who adheres to the law without bending to personal favor; Feng’s discussion of generals is profound! Profound! The saying goes: “To know a person, look at his friends.” The praise of these two men is worthy of being recorded in the halls of government. The Book says: “Not partial, not biased, the way of the king is broad; not biased, not partial, the way of the king is smooth.” Zhang Ji and Feng are close to this ideal. [end of text]
