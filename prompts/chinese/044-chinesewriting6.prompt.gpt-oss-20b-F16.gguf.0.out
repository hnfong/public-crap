<|channel|>analysis<|message|>The user wants a poem in the style of Du Fu (a Tang dynasty poet) about "super artificial intelligence" (超级人工智能). Then a detailed analysis article of the poem. The user wants a poem that references Du Fu's style. Du Fu's style: often concerned with social issues, war, poverty, nature, moral reflection, with a certain seriousness, sometimes with a sense of melancholy, and often with a moral or philosophical reflection. He uses classical Chinese, but the user likely expects a Chinese poem. The user didn't specify language, but Du Fu wrote in Chinese. So we should write a Chinese poem in the style of Du Fu. The poem should be about "super artificial intelligence". That is a modern concept, but we can incorporate it into a classical style. The poem should reflect Du Fu's style: use classical Chinese, with a sense of moral reflection, perhaps referencing the "super AI" as a powerful force, but also reflecting on its impact on humanity, perhaps with a sense of melancholy or caution. The poem should be in Chinese, with classical style, maybe 4 lines or 8 lines. Du Fu's poems often have 8 lines of 5 or 7 characters each. We can write a poem with 8 lines of 7 characters each. The poem should mention "super artificial intelligence" in Chinese: "超级人工智能" or "超人工智能" or "超人工智". We can incorporate that. The poem should reflect Du Fu's style: use imagery of nature, war, poverty, moral reflection. The poem should be about the super AI, perhaps as a "new star" or "new god" that can bring both blessings and dangers. The poem should reflect on the moral responsibilities of humanity. The poem should be in classical Chinese, but we can also provide a translation. The user didn't ask for translation, but we can provide a translation for the analysis. The analysis article should be detailed, analyzing the poem's structure, imagery, themes, style, and how it references Du Fu's style. The analysis should be in Chinese, presumably. The user didn't specify language for the analysis, but likely Chinese. We can provide the poem in Chinese, then the analysis in Chinese. The poem should be about "super artificial intelligence" but in Du Fu's style.
