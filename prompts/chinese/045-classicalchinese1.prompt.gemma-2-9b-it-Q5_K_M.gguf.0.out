## 滑稽列传 Analysis:

**Q1: Short Summary (5 points)**

West Gate Leopard (西门豹) became the magistrate of Ye (邺). He discovered a corrupt practice where three elders, officials, and shamans would collect taxes and use a portion to "marry" a girl to the River God (河伯). This practice caused fear and poverty among the people. Leopard cleverly exposed and ended the ritual, replacing it with twelve irrigation canals that benefited the people.

**Q2: Victims (2 points)**

Young women, often from poor families, were chosen as brides for the River God.

**Q3: Beneficiaries (2 points)**

The three elders, officials, and shamans profited from the taxes collected for the ritual.

**Q4: Wits vs. Force (5 points)**

Leopard primarily used wit and deception. He feigned interest in the ritual, then gradually eliminated the participants (shamans, elders, and officials) by having them thrown into the river. This created fear and ultimately ended the practice.

**Q5: Morality (10 points)**

* **Leopard's Perspective:** He likely saw the practice as exploitative and harmful, justifying his actions as necessary to protect the people.
* **People's Perspective:** They were likely grateful for the end of the ritual and the improved living conditions, even if they found Leopard's methods unsettling.
* **Ethical Perspective:** Some might argue that his actions were morally questionable, as he used deception and violence to achieve his goal. Others might argue that the ends justified the means, given the severity of the problem.

**Q6: The Three Wise Men (15 points)**

The passage compares the abilities of three wise men: Zi Chan (子產), Zi Jian (子賤), and Xi Men Bao (西门豹). It states that they ruled their respective states (Zheng, Danfu, and Ye) so effectively that the people were unable to deceive them.

The comment is subjective and open to interpretation. It highlights the effectiveness of their rule but doesn't necessarily rank them in terms of wisdom. Each ruler likely possessed unique strengths and faced different challenges.

* **Zi Chan:** Known for his wisdom and ability to govern justly.
* **Zi Jian:** Renowned for his integrity and fairness.
* **Xi Men Bao:** Praised for his intelligence and resourcefulness in solving problems.

Ultimately, determining who was the "wisest" is a matter of personal opinion and depends on the criteria used for evaluation.
