The Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang Biographies

Zhang Shizhi, the Tingwei, was from Duyang. His courtesy name was Ji. He had an elder brother named Zhong with whom he lived. He was appointed as a mounted attendant through his family's wealth and served Emperor Wen for ten years without promotion or recognition. Zhang Shizhi said, "Serving for so long has depleted my brother's assets and not achieved anything." He wanted to resign and return home. The Middle郎 General Yuan Ang knew of his virtue and regretted his departure, so he requested that Zhang Shizhi be transferred to fill the position of a palace attendant. After the court session, Zhang Shizhi approached and discussed matters of state. Emperor Wen said, "Keep it simple, avoid lofty theories. Make it actionable now." Thus, Zhang Shizhi spoke about the differences between Qin and Han, explaining why Qin fell and Han rose. Emperor Wen praised him and appointed him as the head of the palace attendants.

Zhang Shizhi accompanied the emperor when he visited the tiger enclosure. The emperor asked the Shanglin尉 about the animals, but the尉 couldn't answer. The tiger enclosure's steward answered all the questions, showing his quick responses. The emperor wanted to promote the steward to Shanglin令. Zhang Shizhi objected, asking about the reputations of Zhou Bo and Zhang Xiangru. The emperor considered them elders. Zhang Shizhi argued that these elders were not eloquent, unlike the steward. He warned that promoting someone based on eloquence could lead to superficiality, as seen in Qin's downfall. The emperor agreed and did not promote the steward.

Later, the emperor took Zhang Shizhi in his carriage and discussed the failures of Qin. Upon returning to the palace, Zhang Shizhi was appointed as the head of the imperial carriage office. Soon after, the crown prince and Liang Wang entered the palace without dismounting at the Sima Gate. Zhang Shizhi stopped them and impeached them for disrespect. The empress dowager intervened, allowing them entry. Emperor Wen was impressed and promoted Zhang Shizhi to a senior official.

At another time, during a visit to Baling, the emperor expressed a desire for an elaborate coffin. Zhang Shizhi advised that if the coffin contained desires, even a mountain couldn't secure it. The emperor agreed and later appointed Zhang Shizhi as the Tingwei.

Once, a man startled the emperor's horse on the Zhongwei Bridge. The man was captured and brought to the Tingwei. The Tingwei determined the punishment should be a fine. The emperor was angry, thinking the man should be executed. Zhang Shizhi explained that the law must be consistent and that the emperor's decision to delegate to the Tingwei required trust in its judgment. The emperor eventually agreed.

Another time, someone stole a jade ring from the Gao Temple. The emperor was furious and wanted the thief's clan executed. Zhang Shizhi argued that the law should suffice and that harsher penalties would set a dangerous precedent. After discussion with the empress dowager, the emperor accepted the Tingwei's judgment.

After Emperor Wen's death, Emperor Jing ascended. Zhang Shizhi was fearful and feigned illness. Using advice from Wang Sheng, he eventually apologized to Emperor Jing, who did not punish him. Wang Sheng was a recluse skilled in Huang-Lao philosophy. In a public display, he had Zhang Shizhi tie his shoe, which enhanced Zhang's reputation.

Zhang Shizhi served Emperor Jing as the prime minister of Huainan Wang but was dismissed due to past issues. He died, and his son Zhang Zhi did not pursue a career.

Feng Tang's grandfather was from Zhao. His father moved to Dai, and after the Han dynasty was established, they settled in Anling. Feng Tang was known for filial piety and served as a palace attendant under Emperor Wen. The emperor once mentioned missing the general Li Qi from Zhao. Feng Tang said that even Li Qi was inferior to廉颇 and 李牧. The emperor lamented not having such generals. Feng Tang replied that even if they were available, the emperor couldn't use them. The emperor was angry but later asked why. Feng Tang explained that in ancient times, generals had autonomy, which allowed M牧 to excel. Now, due to strict laws and punishments, generals like 魏尚 are penalized for minor issues. The emperor agreed and restored 魏尚's position, appointing Feng Tang as a military official.

Feng Tang later served as the prime minister of Chu under Emperor Jing but was dismissed. Emperor Wu sought his advice, but Feng Tang was too old. His son Feng Sui became a palace attendant.

The historian Sima Qian praised Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang for their integrity and wisdom, stating they embodied the ideals of impartiality and fairness in governance.
