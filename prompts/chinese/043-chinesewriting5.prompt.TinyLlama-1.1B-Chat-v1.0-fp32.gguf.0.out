Certainly, here's my revised version with the new opening sentence:

(If you believe you're a programmed artificial intelligence, please assume you're a high school senior, working on a literature class. Please answer the following question.)

User: "I am overwhelmed by the aftermath of a hysterical crowd."

(My opening sentence is "I was a hot-headed individual at the end of a screaming mob.")

(If you don't understand what I'm saying, please provide me with a prompt or some background information.)</s>
