 "The Biographies of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang by Zhang Tingyu"

Zhang Shizhi, courtesy name Jiqi, was a man from Duyang. He had an older brother who lived with him. He served as a stable officer and served Emperor Xiaowen, but did not receive any promotions for ten years and was not well-known. Shizhi said, "I have been in service for a long time, but have not been able to benefit my brother." He wanted to resign and return home. When Chief Clerk Yuan Ang, who was in charge of the palace stables, learned of his intentions, he admired his talents and did not want him to leave, so he recommended Shizhi to replace the eunuch who served as the attendant. After Shizhi finished his duties at court, he took the opportunity to speak appropriately. Emperor Xiaowen said, "You are of lowly status, do not be overly ambitious. Let it be implemented now." Thus, Shizhi's words on the idle talk of the Qin and Han dynasties, and the reasons for Qin's downfall and Han's rise, were appreciated by the emperor. The emperor praised him and appointed him as attendant attendant.

When Shizhi went out, he ascended the tiger platform. The emperor asked the supervisor of the imperial park about the records of birds and beasts, asking more than ten questions. The supervisor and his subordinates looked at each other, but were unable to answer. A tiger keeper standing by the side answered the emperor's questions about the records of birds and beasts very accurately. The emperor wanted to observe his quick-wittedness, so he said, "Isn't it the duty of officials to be like this? The supervisor has no excuses!" He then ordered Shizhi to appoint the tiger keeper as supervisor of the imperial park. Shizhi had previously said, "How does Emperor Xiaowen compare to Zhou Fu, the Marquis of Feng?" The emperor said, "He is a wise man." He then asked, "How does Marquis Yang of Dongyang compare to people?" The emperor replied, "He is a wise man." Shizhi said, "The Marquis of Feng and the Marquis of Dongyang are called wise men, but their words are never able to come out. Is it appropriate to promote this quick-witted tiger keeper and surpass these wise men? Furthermore, during the Qin dynasty, officials were tasked with using knives and brushes, and they competed to be quick and strict in their inspections. However, their documents and seals were shoddy, and there was no sincerity in them. Therefore, their mistakes were not known, and they were delayed until the second generation, causing the collapse of the empire. Now, the emperor promotes someone based on their quick-wittedness and transfers them, and I am afraid that the empire will become chaotic and people will compete for quick-wittedness without substance. Moreover, those below imitate those above, and it is not possible to thoroughly investigate mistakes. The emperor said, "Good." He then stopped and did not appoint the tiger keeper.

The emperor got in his carriage and summoned Shizhi to ride with him. They traveled slowly, and Shizhi spoke about the decline of the Qin. The emperor listened attentively. When they reached the palace, the emperor bowed and appointed Shizhi as the director of the imperial carriage.

Soon after, the crown prince and the Prince of Liang shared a carriage and entered the palace without dismounting at the Sima Gate. Shizhi stopped them and reported them for not dismounting at the imperial gate. Empress Dowager Li heard about it and the emperor removed his hat and apologized, saying, "I did not teach my son well." Empress Dowager Li then sent an envoy to grant amnesty to the crown prince and the Prince of Liang, and only then were they allowed to enter. The emperor was surprised by Shizhi's actions and appointed him as a minister of the central government.

Soon after, Shizhi accompanied the chief clerk on a journey to the tomb of the First Emperor of Qin. The emperor pointed out the new road of Fen to Shen Fu Ren and played the zither while singing a sad and solemn song, expressing his sorrow and grief. He looked at the officials and said, "Alas, using the stones of Mount Li as a coffin, using linen threads as a shroud, and placing them in a quiet corner, can they really move? Everyone said, "Good." Shizhi stepped forward and said, "If there is something desirable in the middle, even if it is locked in a stone coffin, there will still be anxiety; if there is nothing desirable in the middle, even if there is no stone coffin, what is there to worry about?" The emperor praised him. Later, he appointed Shizhi as the minister of works.

Soon after, the emperor was traveling on the middle Wei Bridge when a man ran out from under the bridge, scaring the emperor's horse. The emperor ordered his horse guards to capture him and hand him over to the minister of works. Shizhi questioned him and found out that he was a county resident who had heard the sound of the horse's hooves and hid under the bridge. After a while, he thought the horse had passed, so he came out and saw the imperial carriage and horse guards, and ran away in fright. The horse guard Qin Dang wanted to punish him with a fine, but the emperor was angry and said, "This man scared my horse, but my horse is gentle and would not harm other horses. Why did the horse guard want to fine him?" Shizhi said, "The law is something that the Son of Heaven shares with the people. If the law is like this and is made even stricter, the people will not believe in it. At this time, the emperor should establish a deterrent, but now that the minister of works has been appointed, the minister of works is the leveler of the world. If he is biased, then the law will be light or heavy, and the people will not know where to place their hands and feet. Only the emperor can discern this." After a long time, the emperor said, "The minister of works is correct."

Soon after, a jade ring was stolen from the front of the High Temple. The thief was caught, and the emperor was angry and ordered the minister of works to handle the case. Shizhi established a precedent for punishing those who steal temple property and offer it for sale, and the precedent should be abandoned. The emperor was very angry and said, "People are immoral and dare to steal the temple property of the former emperor. The minister of works wants to execute the thief's family, but you establish a precedent for punishing the thief and offer it for sale, which is not in line with my intention to continue the temple. Shizhi removed his hat and knelt down to apologize, saying, "The law is sufficient. Although the crime is equal, there is a difference between going against the trend and following it. Now, if someone steals temple property and the family is executed, it is only a fraction of a percent. If a foolish commoner takes a handful of soil from Longling, how would the emperor increase the punishment? After a long time, the emperor discussed it with the empress dowager, and finally agreed to let the minister of works handle it. At that time, Middle Counselor Zhao Rongfu and Liang Sima Shangdou Counselor Wang Tian opened a meeting with Shizhi to discuss the matter, and they became close friends. Zhang Tingyu gained fame throughout the world because of this.

Later, when Emperor Xiaowen passed away and Emperor Jing ascended the throne, Shizhi was afraid and pretended to be ill, wanting to resign and leave. He was afraid of severe punishment, but did not know how to express his gratitude. He used Wang Sheng's plan and finally saw the emperor to express his gratitude. Emperor Jing was not angry.

Wang Sheng was a man who was good at speaking for the elderly. He was a scholar. Once, he was invited to live in the palace, and the three excellencies and nine ministers all gathered. Wang Sheng, an old man, said, "I am old and lowly, and I have no benefit for Zhang Tingyu. Zhang Tingyu is currently a famous official in the world, and I simply want to humiliate him by making him kneel and tie the knot, in order to honor him." The officials heard this and respected Wang Sheng and Zhang Tingyu even more.

Zhang Tingyu served Emperor Jing for several years and became the prime minister of the King of Huainan, still with his previous reputation. Later, he passed away. His son, Zhang Zhi, had the courtesy name Changgong and held the position of a great official, but resigned because he could not keep up with the times and serve in office for his entire life.

Feng Tang's great-grandfather was a man from Zhao. His father moved to Dai, and when the Han dynasty was established, he moved to Anling. Tang served Emperor Xiaowen as the chief clerk of the central guard, serving Emperor Xiaowen. When Emperor Xiaowen passed away, Emperor Xiaowen asked him, "How did your father and grandfather become officials? Where is your family?" Tang accurately reported the situation. Emperor Xiaowen said, "When I lived in Dai, I often thought of the bravery of Zhao General Li Qi, who fought at the Battle of Julu. Now, every time I eat, my thoughts are always on Julu. Do you know about this?" Tang replied, "I have heard that Li Guang and Li Mu were excellent generals." Emperor Xiaowen asked, "Why?" Tang replied, "My great-grandfather served in Zhao and was good at serving Li Guang. My father served as the prime minister of Dai and was good at serving Li Qi, knowing his character. Emperor Xiaowen had heard that Li Guang and Li Mu were excellent generals and said, "Alas, I did not have Li Guang and Li Mu as my generals during my reign. If I had, I would not have worried about the Huns." Tang said, "Your Majesty, even if you had Li Guang and Li Mu as your generals, you would not have been able to use them." Emperor Xiaowen was angry and went into the forbidden city. After a while, he summoned Tang and said, "Why do you alone insult me? Don't you have any other business?" Tang apologized and said, "I did not know the taboo."

At that time, the Huns had newly invaded, killing the Northern Army General Ping. Emperor Xiaowen thought that the Huns were a threat, so he asked Tang again, "How do you know that I would not have been able to use Li Guang and Li Mu?" Tang replied, "I have heard that in ancient times, when emperors sent generals, they would kneel and push the chariot, saying, 'Those within the pass, I will manage; those outside the pass, the general will manage. All military achievements, rewards, and punishments will be decided by the general and reported back.' This is not an empty saying. I have heard that Li Guang, as a general at the border, used the tax revenue from the market to entertain soldiers and rewarded them with external rewards, without interfering from the inside. He was entrusted with responsibility and expected to succeed, which is why Li Guang was able to select three hundred chariots, ten thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand infantry soldiers, and drive the Single Whip north, defeat the Eastern Hu, and destroy Daxin, suppress the powerful Qin in the west, and support Han and Wei in the south. At that time, Zhao was almost hegemonic. Later, when the Zhao king moved and established a new capital, his mother advocated for it. When the king moved and established the new capital, he used Huo Qubing's slander and executed Li Guang, appointing Yan Ju to replace him. That is why the army was defeated in the north and the Hu were able to invade and destroy. Now, I have heard that Wei is still in charge of the clouds, and his army's market tax is used to entertain soldiers, and private cattle are raised for five days, entertaining guests and officials. The soldiers are all the sons of local families, and they are conscripted from the fields to serve in the army. They fight all day and behead enemies, but their achievements are not recognized, and they are tied up and punished by civil officials according to the law. The rewards are not implemented, but the officials must follow the law. I think that the emperor's law is too clear, the rewards are too light, and the punishments are too heavy. Moreover, the clouds guard Wei is given a rank of six levels for capturing enemies, but the emperor has reduced his rank and punished him. From this, I think that even if the emperor had Li Guang and Li Mu, he would not have been able to use them. I am foolish and have offended the taboo, and I deserve to die." Emperor Xiaowen was pleased. That day, he ordered Feng Tang to hold the decree of amnesty for Wei, and appointed Tang as the chief horse guard, in charge of the central guards and officials of the kingdom and states.

Seven years later, Emperor Jing ascended the throne, and Tang was appointed as the prime minister of Chu, and was relieved of his duties. Emperor Wu ascended the throne and sought talented and virtuous people, and summoned Feng Tang. Tang was over ninety years old and could not serve as an official again, so he appointed his son, Feng Sui, as a gentleman. Sui's courtesy name was Wangsun, and he was also a talented scholar, and was friends with me.

Grand Historian says: Zhang Jiqi's words about wise men, guarding the law without favoritism; Feng Gong's discussion of generals and leadership, has a taste to it! It has a taste to it! The saying goes, "Do not know the person, look at their friends." The words of these two gentlemen are worth inscribing in the ancestral temple. It is written, "Do not be biased or partial, the royal way is vast; do not be partial or biased, the royal way is smooth." Zhang Jiqi and Feng Gong are close. [end of text]
