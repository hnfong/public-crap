Below are the requested analyses of the passage from 荀子 (Xunzi):

### (1) Translation into English

**The Story of Wu Qi and Wei Wu Hou**

Wei Wu Hou, after successfully resolving a matter with his plans, found that none of his ministers could match his wisdom. Upon retiring from court, he showed a joyful expression. Wu Qi approached him and said, "Have you ever heard the story of Chu Zhuang Wang from those around you?" Wu Hou asked, "What is the story of Chu Zhuang Wang?" Wu Qi replied:

"Chu Zhuang Wang once successfully planned a matter, and his ministers couldn't comprehend it. Upon retiring from court, he showed a worried expression. Shen Gong Wu Zhen approached and asked, 'Why the worry, Your Majesty, after a successful day?' Zhuang Wang said, 'I worry because, despite my successful planning, none of my ministers could understand or match me. There's an old saying: "A lord who finds a worthy advisor will become a king, one who finds a good friend will become a hegemon, one who encounters doubt will survive, but one who plans alone with no equal will perish." Now, with my inferiority, and none of my ministers able to match me, our state is nearly doomed! Hence, my worry.'"

Wu Qi continued, "Chu Zhuang Wang worried in such a situation, yet you, my lord, rejoice." Wei Wu Hou, taken aback, bowed twice and said, "Heaven has sent you to correct my shortcomings."

### (2) Moral of the Story

- **Awareness of One's Limitations and the Importance of Capable Advisors**: The moral highlights the danger of a ruler's superiority over their advisors, emphasizing the need for a ruler to recognize their own limitations and the value of having wise, capable ministers who can challenge and support their decisions. A ruler's joy in being unsurpassed by their ministers (as seen with Wei Wu Hou) is misguided, as it indicates a lack of the collective wisdom necessary for long-term success and survival. Instead, a ruler should worry if they have no equals among their advisors, as this signals a vulnerability.

- **Humility and the Willingness to Learn**: The story also teaches the importance of humility in leadership. A true leader should be open to correction and willing to learn from others, as demonstrated by Wei Wu Hou's respectful response to Wu Qi's critique.

### (3) Counterparts in Western (European) Thought

Several concepts from the story have counterparts or parallels in Western European thought:

- **Importance of Wise Counsel**:
  - **Aristotle's "Politics"**: Emphasizes the role of good counsel in governance, though not exactly in the context of a ruler being surpassed.
  - **Machiavelli's "The Prince"**: Discusses the importance of advisors but warns against the dangers of bad counsel, indirectly highlighting the value of wise and challenging advisors.

- **Recognition of One's Limitations**:
  - **Socratic Humility (Plato's Socrates)**: The acknowledgment of the limits of one's knowledge, encouraging the pursuit of wisdom through dialogue and the recognition of not knowing what one does not know.
  - **Aristotelian Concept of "Phronesis"**: While not directly about limitation, it emphasizes practical wisdom, which includes understanding one's capabilities and limitations in decision-making.

- **Collective Wisdom and the Danger of Unchallenged Leadership**:
  - **Aristotle's Concept of Collective Wisdom in "Politics"**: Suggests that the collective judgment of many can be wiser than that of a single individual, even a wise one.
  - **Montesquieu's "The Spirit of the Laws"**: Discusses the principle of separation of powers, indirectly addressing the dangers of unchecked power and the importance of balance and challenge within governance. [end of text]
