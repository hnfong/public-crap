assistantUser asks: "請問這段文字出自哪裡？段落完整的原文是甚麼？" The text is: "臣非非難言也，所以難言者：言順比滑澤，洋洋纚纚然，則見以為華而不實...." The text is in Chinese. It is likely from some classical Chinese text. Let me analyze: "臣非非難言也" means "I am not criticizing words" or "I am not criticizing words" but then "所以難言者" means "so it is difficult to speak" or "thus it is difficult to speak" maybe. The text "言順比滑澤，洋洋纚纚然" means "words are smooth and flowing, like a river, or something like that" but then "則見以為華而不實" means "thus they are seen as being ornamental but not substantial." It might be from a classical text discussing the nature of language or rhetoric. Possibly from "文心雕龍" or "論語" or "孟子" or "荀子" or "韓非子" or "司馬遷" or "賈誼" or "司馬相如" or "揚雄" or "劉向" or "蔡邕" or "王充" or "鄭玄" or "蘇軾" or "文選" etc.

Let's try to recall: "言順比滑澤" might be a phrase from "文心雕龍" by Liu Xie. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, it might be from "文賦" or "文選" or "文心雕龍" or "文心雕龍" is a famous treatise on literary arts by Liu Xie. But the text "臣非非難言也" is not common in "文心雕龍". Alternatively, it might be from "文心雕龍" but I'm not sure.

Let's check: "臣非非難言也" might be from "文賦" by Sima Xiangru? But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, it might be from "文心雕龍" by Liu Xie. Let me recall: "文心雕龍" is a treatise on literary arts by Liu Xie, written in the early 6th century. It has many chapters discussing the nature of writing. The text "言順比滑澤" might be from a chapter discussing the style of writing. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, it might be from "文心雕龍" chapter "文賦" or "文體" or "文藝" etc. Let me recall: "臣非非難言也" might be from "文心雕龍" chapter "文賦" or "文體" or "文藝" etc. But I'm not sure.
