### (1) Translation:  
During the reign of Marquis Wu of Wei (魏武侯), he made decisions wisely, and none of his ministers could match him. After court sessions, he would show a pleased expression. Wu Qi (吳起) approached him and said, "Have you heard a story about King Zhuang of Chu (楚莊王) from your advisors?" Marquis Wu asked, "What about King Zhuang's story?" Wu Qi replied, "When King Zhuang made wise decisions, and none of his ministers could match him, he would show a worried expression after court. Shen Gong Wu Xiang (申公巫臣) asked him, 'Why the worried expression after court?' King Zhuang said, 'I worry because, though I make wise decisions, none of my ministers can match me. As the ancient saying goes: 'A ruler who finds a teacher will reign, one who finds friends will dominate, one who finds rivals will survive, but one who relies only on himself will perish.' Now, with my incompetence, if my ministers cannot match me, my state is close to ruin! That is why I worry.' King Zhuang worried, but Your Majesty rejoices." Marquis Wu hesitated, then bowed twice, saying, "Heaven has sent you to correct my mistake."

### (2) Moral of the Story:  
The story teaches humility and the dangers of complacency. A ruler (or leader) should not take pride in outshining their subordinates but should instead strive for collective wisdom and growth. True strength lies in surrounding oneself with capable people and learning from them, not in self-satisfaction. The moral aligns with the Confucian ideals of self-reflection and the pursuit of virtue through continuous improvement.

### (3) Western Counterpart:  
The concepts in the story resonate with Western philosophical and leadership ideas:  
- **Socratic Ignorance**: Socrates' belief that recognizing one's own ignorance is the first step to wisdom parallels King Zhuang's humility in acknowledging his shortcomings.  
- **Plato's Philosopher-King**: The ideal ruler in Plato's *Republic* is one who values knowledge and seeks wise counsel rather than relying solely on personal judgment.  
- **Sun Tzu's *The Art of War***: The emphasis on collective strength over individual brilliance is echoed in Sun Tzu's advice to "build your opponent a golden bridge" (i.e., avoid overconfidence).  
- **Aristotelian Virtue Ethics**: The story aligns with Aristotle's view that a good leader cultivates virtues like humility and prudence, rather than pride.  

A direct Western parallel might be the Roman historian Livy's account of Marcus Regulus, who, despite his military prowess, was undone by arrogance—a cautionary tale against self-superiority.  

The core idea—that leadership thrives on collaboration and humility—transcends cultures and is a universal principle in ethical governance. [end of text]
