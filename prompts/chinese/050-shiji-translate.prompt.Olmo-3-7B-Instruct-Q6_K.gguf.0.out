Zhang Shiqi once served as an official with the title Zhang Tingyi, whose family name was Ji. He had a brother and a younger brother, all living together. He was appointed as a Cavalry Squire and served under Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. At the age of ten, he was not yet allowed to ride a horse or be known by name. Zhang Shiqi said: “I have long served as a squire for the sons and nephews of the Ji clan, but I have not fulfilled my duty.” He wanted to resign and return home. The eunuch Beiyang knew of his wisdom and regretted his departure, so he asked the emperor to allow Zhang Shiqi to stay and recommend someone else. Once Zhang Shiqi had already submitted his resignation, he continued to speak favorably to the emperor, making arrangements for his departure.

Emperor Xuanzong said: “You are humble; do not speak too highly. Let what can be implemented now be put into practice.” From then on, Zhang Shiqi’s words about the affairs of the Qin and Han dynasties became well-known. It was because of the Qin’s mismanagement that they lost the way, while the Han restored it through wise governance—this took a long time. Emperor Xuanzong praised Zhang Shiqi’s abilities and, in recognition, made him a trusted official in charge of the eunuchs’ stores.

Zhang Shiqi followed through on his duties and was appointed to oversee the tiger cages. The emperor asked the senior officials about the lists of birds and beasts in the zoological gardens; most could not answer correctly. Yet when it came to the tiger cages, the guards were thorough in their knowledge. The emperor wanted to see how well Zhang Shiqi could speak about the animals, so he tested him by asking endless questions about the zoo. Emperor Xuanzong said: “Are the officials really so incompetent?” and then ordered Zhang Shiqi to be promoted to head of the eunuchs’ stores.

Before long, Zhang Shiqi was promoted to be a Left Minister. Soon after, while traveling from the palace, the emperor encountered Zhang Shiqi by the Middle River bridge. A man came out on horseback, startling the emperor’s horse. The emperor sent a cavalry patrol, and they brought the man to the Left Minister. Zhang Shiqi investigated and interrogated him. He said: “The man came out of the bridge thinking he had escaped, but as soon as he realized he was still being followed, he tried to run again and was caught.” The Left Minister, following Zhang Shiqi’s advice, fined the man.

Zhang Shiqi continued to serve faithfully. He was promoted to tiger-cage supervisor. The emperor asked the senior officials about him and was satisfied. Eventually, the emperor made Zhang Shiqi the Right Chancellor. Soon after, the prince and the king of Liang arrived in the carriage but did not enter the Hall of audience. Zhang Shiqi stopped them from entering the palace. Later, when they tried to force their way in, he reported the incident. The Empress Dowager Liang and Emperor Xuanzong removed their crowns in apology and granted clemency to the prince and king of Liang, allowing them to enter.

After this, Emperor Xuanzong became suspicious of Zhang Shiqi and thought he was ill. He wanted to dismiss him, but feared he would be executed; yet if he tried to thank him, he would not know how to do so. Using his own judgment, he eventually thanked Zhang Shiqi before his death, but Emperor Xuanzong was not as lenient as before.

Zhang Shiqi’s father was Zhang Zhong, a great-grandson of the Han dynasty’s founding general Zhao. He had moved several times due to official postings. When the Han dynasty was founded, he moved to Anling. As a loyal subject of the Tang, he served as Chancellor of the Left and reported to Emperor Xuanzong. When passing by, the emperor asked Zhang Shiqi’s father how he came to be a chancellor despite his old age. Zhang Shiqi’s father explained that his father, Zhang Zhong, had served as a general under the warlords Li Meng and Zhao Ge, known for his integrity. He knew his father was a good man. The emperor, having heard of Li Meng and Zhao Ge’s virtue, praised them but said he alone could not find a general as capable as them. How could he worry about the Mongols?

Zhang Shiqi replied: “Your Majesty, though you have found Li Meng and Zhao Ge, you cannot use them. Their loyalty and virtue are beyond measure.” The emperor got angry, entered the restricted area, and after some time summoned Zhang Shiqi to explain. He said: “A minister’s worth is not measured by how many officials you can corrupt, but by how you govern the people. If the law is as you say and heavier punishments are expected, the people will not believe in it. At this crucial time, if you were to execute someone, it would already be too late. Now that you have made Zhang Shiqi the Right Chancellor, the officials are at peace. One fall and the whole system becomes light and easy for the people. Only you can discern this.” After much deliberation, the emperor agreed.

Soon, the emperor said: “The Right Chancellor agrees.”  
Later, a thief stole from the Hall of Supreme Harmony’s jade ring, and the officials caught him. The emperor was furious and had Zhang Shiqi deal with it. Zhang Shiqi recommended that the thief be punished by being sent to the market as a warning. The emperor was very angry, saying that the man had dared to steal from the tomb of an earlier emperor, and yet the Left Chancellor was to punish him. Zhang Shiqi replied: “The law belongs to the emperor and the people of the world. Now the law is harsher than it should be, and the people do not trust it. At this time, if the emperor were to issue the death sentence, it would already be too late. Since the Left Chancellor is now a trusted official, the peace of the country depends on him. One slip and the whole nation’s laws become light or heavy at will—how can the people manage without your discernment?” After much discussion, the emperor agreed.

Eventually, the emperor said: “The Right Chancellor is right.”  
After that, a thief broke into the Hall of Supreme Harmony and stole the jade ring. The officials caught him and reported to the emperor. The emperor was angry and had Zhang Shiqi handle the case. Zhang Shiqi suggested that the thief be punished by being sent to the market as a warning and that he should also serve as a model for others. The emperor was very angry, saying that the official who stole from the emperor’s tomb should expect to lose his head, yet the Left Chancellor was to enforce the law. Zhang Shiqi said: “The law should be set by the emperor and agreed upon by all the people. Now the law is too harsh and the people do not accept it. At this critical moment, if the emperor were to order execution, it would already be too late. Since the Left Chancellor is now in charge, the officials are peaceful. If one official fails, the whole system is thrown into chaos. The people’s fate depends on the officials’ integrity. If the emperor is wise, he will judge fairly.”

After a long time, the emperor said: “The Right Chancellor is correct.”  
He then ordered that the thief who stole from the Hall of Supreme Harmony be pardoned and allowed to return. He also made Zhang Shiqi the military commissioner for cavalry, and appointed the Left Chancellor and other officials to similar positions.

Seven years later, Emperor Xuanzong was succeeded by Emperor Yongzheng, who made Zhang Shiqi the chancellor of Chu and removed him. Later, Emperor Wu of the Qing dynasty sought wise ministers and recommended Zhang Shiqi. Zhang Shiqi was still in his nineties when he could no longer hold office, so he recommended his son Zhang Zhongyue to become a squire. Zhang Zhongyue became a notable official and was well-liked along with the rest.

The Historian of Later Han said: The words of Zhang Shiqi about integrity and the law are worth heeding; the arguments of Zhang Zhong and Han Wang (Zhang Hong) have merit! “Know not a man, but know his friend.” The two emperors’ praises and criticisms can be recorded in the halls and temples. There are records like: “Not partial, not biased; the way of the king shines brightly; not biased, not partial; the way of the king is steady and sure.” Zhang Shiqi and Han Wang were very close.

Zhang Shiqi (張釋之) was a high-ranking official under Emperor Xuanzong of Tang. He was from the Ji clan (字季), had brothers and a younger brother, and was appointed as a Cavalry Squire (騎郎). He served under Xuanzong but was only ten when he could not ride a horse or be officially recognized by name. He said he had long served as a squire for the Ji family’s sons and nephews but had not fulfilled his duty. He wanted to resign but was persuaded to stay by Beiyang (袁盎), who knew his wisdom and regretted his leaving. Xuanzong eventually promoted Zhang Shiqi to a high position among the eunuchs.

Zhang Shiqi followed through on his responsibilities, including overseeing the tiger cages. The emperor tested him with questions about the zoo and was pleased. Eventually, Xuanzong made Zhang Shiqi the Right Chancellor (右餘). Soon after, the prince and king of Liang arrived in a grand procession but were stopped from entering the palace by Zhang Shiqi. Later, when they tried forceful entry, Zhang Shiqi reported the incident. The Empress Dowager and Xuanzong apologized and granted clemency to the prince and king of Liang, allowing them in.

After Xuanzong became suspicious of Zhang Shiqi, believing he was ill, he considered removing him but feared execution. Ultimately, using his own judgment, Xuanzong thanked Zhang Shiqi before his death, though less leniently than before.

Zhang Shiqi’s father was Zhang Zhong (張摯,字長公), a descendant of the founding general Zhao and a former Chancellor of the Left under the Han. He moved several times due to official postings. When the Han dynasty began, he went to Anling. He served loyally under the Tang, including under Xuanzong, who questioned him about his promotion despite his age. Zhang Zhong explained his father had served as a general under Li Meng and Zhao Ge, both known for integrity. He knew his father was trustworthy. Xuanzong, having heard of Li Meng and Zhao Ge’s virtue, acknowledged them but said only he could not find a better general. He expressed no concern about the Mongols.

Zhang Shiqi responded that even if Xuanzong found such good ministers, he could not use them because of their loyalty and integrity. Xuanzong was angered, entered the restricted area, and after time, accepted Zhang Shiqi’s explanation. He eventually made Zhang Shiqi the Left Chancellor (中大夫). Later, after Zhang Shiqi’s death, Xuanzong was satisfied with his service.

A thief stole from the Hall of Supreme Harmony’s jade ring and was caught by officials. Xuanzong was furious and had Zhang Shiqi deal with the case. Zhang Shiqi suggested the thief be sent to the market as a warning and serve as an example. Xuanzong was angry that the Left Chancellor was enforcing harsh laws, but Zhang Shiqi argued the law should be just and agreed upon by all. Xuanzong, at a critical moment, agreed with Zhang Shiqi’s judgment and pardoned the thief.

After years, Emperor Yongzheng made Zhang Shiqi the chancellor of Chu and removed him. Later, Emperor Wu of the Qing sought Zhang Shiqi’s advice and recommended him. Zhang Shiqi, now very old, could not hold office but recommended his son Zhang Zhongyue to become a squire. Zhang Zhongyue became respected and successful in his role.

The Historian of Later Han noted that Zhang Shiqi’s words on integrity and governance were valuable, and that Zhang Zhong and Han Wang (Zhang Hong) also had sound arguments. “Know not a man, but know his friend.” The praise and criticism of the two emperors could be documented in official records. There are sayings like: “Not partial, not biased; the king’s path is clear; not biased, not partial; the king’s way is steady.” Zhang Shiqi and Han Wang were close allies.
