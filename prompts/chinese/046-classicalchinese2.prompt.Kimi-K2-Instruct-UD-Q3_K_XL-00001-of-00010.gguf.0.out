(1) English translation

Duke Wu of Wei had deliberated on state affairs and reached excellent decisions; none of his ministers could equal him. When the court adjourned he wore a pleased expression. Wu Qi stepped forward and said, “Has Your Highness ever heard, from those around you, the words of King Zhuang of Chu?”  
Duke Wu asked, “What did King Zhuang of Chu say?”  
Wu Qi replied: “King Zhuang of Chu once deliberated on affairs and also reached excellent decisions, yet none of his ministers could equal him. When the court adjourned he looked worried. Shen Gong Wuchen came forward and asked, ‘Your Majesty, you leave court looking troubled—why?’  
King Zhuang answered, ‘I have deliberated well, yet none of my ministers can match me. That is why I am worried. The saying in Zhonglü goes: “A ruler who finds teachers among his lords will become king; one who finds friends among them will become hegemon; one who finds mere advisers will merely survive; one who relies only on himself and has no one to match him will perish.” I, an unworthy man, have no minister who can equal me—my state is close to ruin!’ Thus King Zhuang was distressed, whereas Your Highness is pleased.”  
Duke Wu stepped back, bowed twice, and said, “Heaven has sent you, Master, to correct my fault.”

(2) Moral of the story

A ruler’s true strength lies in surrounding himself with people who can challenge, supplement, and even surpass his own judgment. If every decision is better than what his advisers can produce, it means the talent pool is shallow and the state is in danger. Therefore, far from congratulating himself, the wise ruler worries when he stands intellectually alone.

(3) Western counterparts

The idea is echoed in several strands of European thought:

• Classical political theory: Plato (Republic, Statesman) and Aristotle (Politics) insist that good government requires a community of virtue and intelligence; a solitary “best mind” is a sign of oligarchy or tyranny, not health.  
• Machiavelli (Discourses, I.58) warns that princes who have no counselors equal or superior to themselves are likely to fall.  
• Modern management theory: the “Apollo syndrome” (Dr. Meredith Belbin) observes that a team dominated by the brightest individual often underperforms, because dissent and complementary strengths are missing.  
• The proverb “If you are the smartest person in the room, you are in the wrong room” conveys the same warning in contemporary leadership literature.

Thus the Chinese warning that “自為謀而莫己若者亡” finds close parallels in Western discussions of collective wisdom, the value of dissent, and the danger of intellectual autocracy. [end of text]
