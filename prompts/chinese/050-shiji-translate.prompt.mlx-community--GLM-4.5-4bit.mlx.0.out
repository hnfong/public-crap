The Biography of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang

Zhang Shizhi, the Commandant of Justice, was a man of Duyang, with the style name Ji. He had an elder brother, Zhong, with whom he lived. He became a Cavalry Gentleman by means of his wealth and served Emperor Xiaowen. After ten years, he was not promoted and was not known for anything. Shizhi said: "Being an official for a long time is diminishing my brother Zhong's property, and I have not succeeded." He wished to resign and return home. The General of the Household, Yuan Ang, knew of his worth and regretted his departure, so he requested that Shizhi be transferred to the post of Usher. After Shizhi had finished the court audience, he took the opportunity to speak of matters that would be beneficial. Emperor Wen said: "Be humble, do not speak too loftily, but speak of what can be implemented now." Thereupon, Shizhi spoke of the affairs between Qin and Han, why Qin lost its power and why Han rose, for a long time. Emperor Wen praised him as good, and then appointed Shizhi as the Chief Usher.

Shizhi followed the emperor on an excursion and ascended the tiger enclosure. The emperor asked the Warden of the Shanglin Park about the registers of the various birds and beasts. After more than ten questions, the warden looked left and right, and was unable to answer any of them. The Keeper of the tiger enclosure, standing nearby, answered for the warden all the questions the emperor had asked about the registers of birds and beasts in great detail, wishing to show his ability to respond orally and without end. Emperor Wen said: "Should an official not be like this? The warden is useless!" He then ordered Shizhi to appoint the Keeper as the Governor of Shanglin. Shizhi stepped forward after a long while and said: "What does Your Majesty think of the Marquis of Jiang, Zhou Bo?" The emperor said: "He is an elder." He then asked again: "What of the Marquis of Dongyang, Zhang Xiangru?" The emperor again said: "He is an elder." Shizhi said: "The Marquis of Jiang and the Marquis of Dongyang are called elders, yet these two men could not even get their words out when discussing affairs. How could they emulate this Keeper's glib, sharp, and quick tongue! Moreover, Qin, by appointing officials who were skilled with the knife and brush, had officials who competed to be harsh and severe, but the flaw in this was that it was merely a formality, without the substance of compassion. For this reason, their faults were not heard of, and they declined until the Second Emperor, when the realm collapsed. Now, if Your Majesty promotes this Keeper because of his eloquent speech, I fear that all under Heaven will follow this trend, competing in eloquent speech without substance. Furthermore, the influence of the subordinates on the superiors is faster than a shadow or an echo; appointments and dismissals cannot but be examined carefully." Emperor Wen said: "Good." Thereupon, he stopped and did not appoint the Keeper.

The emperor boarded his carriage and summoned Shizhi to ride with him. They rode slowly, and the emperor asked Shizhi about the flaws of Qin. Shizhi answered him with straightforward words. When they reached the palace, the emperor appointed Shizhi as the Prefect of the Palace Gate.

Soon after, the Crown Prince and the Prince of Liang entered the court in the same carriage and did not dismount at the Sima Gate. Thereupon, Shizhi pursued and stopped the Crown Prince and the Prince of Liang, not allowing them to enter the palace gate. He then impeached them for not dismounting at the public gate, which was disrespectful, and submitted the report. Empress Dowager Bo heard of this, and Emperor Wen took off his cap and apologized, saying: "I have not taught my sons carefully." Empress Dowager Bo then sent a messenger with an edict to pardon the Crown Prince and the Prince of Liang, and only then were they allowed to enter. Because of this, Emperor Wen found Shizhi remarkable and appointed him as a Grand Master.

Soon after, he was promoted to General of the Household. He followed the emperor on an excursion to Baling and stood on the north side overlooking the latrine. At that time, Consort Shun was following. The emperor pointed out the road to Xinfeng to Consort Shun and said: "This is the road that leads to Handan." He had Consort Shun play the zither, and he himself leaned against a zither and sang, his mood sorrowful and sad. He looked back at his ministers and said: "Alas! If one were to use the stones of the Northern Mountain for the outer coffin, stuff it with cut silk floss, and lacquer the gaps, how could it be moved!" Those around him all said: "Good." Shizhi stepped forward and said: "If there is something desirable within, even if it is sealed with the Southern Mountain, there will be a crack; if there is nothing desirable within, even without a stone coffin, what is there to worry about!" Emperor Wen praised him as good. Afterwards, he appointed Shizhi as the Commandant of Justice.

Soon after, the emperor was traveling out of the Central Wei Bridge when a person came out from under the bridge, startling the emperor's carriage horses. He then sent cavalry to capture the man and handed him over to the Commandant of Justice. Shizhi interrogated him. The man said: "I am a man from the county. I heard the imperial clearing of the way and hid under the bridge. After a long time, I thought the procession had passed, so I came out. Seeing the imperial carriage and cavalry, I just ran." The Commandant of Justice submitted his judgment: one person violating the imperial clearing of the way should be fined. Emperor Wen said angrily: "This person startled my horses himself. My horses are gentle by nature; if they had been other horses, would I not have been injured or killed? And the Commandant of Justice only sentences him to a fine!" Shizhi said: "The law is what the Son of Heaven and all under Heaven hold in common. Now, if the law is like this and you make it heavier, the law will not be trusted by the people. Moreover, at that moment, if Your Majesty had ordered him to be executed on the spot, that would have been the end of it. Now that he has been handed over to the Commandant of Justice, the Commandant of Justice is the standard of fairness for all under Heaven. If he leans one way or the other, then the application of the law throughout the realm will be made light or heavy, and where will the people be able to place their hands and feet? I only ask Your Majesty to consider this." After a long while, the emperor said: "The Commandant of Justice's judgment is correct."

Afterwards, someone stole a jade ring from the front of the ancestral temple of Emperor Gao. The thief was captured, and Emperor Wen was furious. He handed him over to the Commandant of Justice for punishment. Shizhi, according to the law for those who steal articles of clothing and use from the ancestral temple, submitted his judgment, which was execution in the marketplace. The emperor was greatly angered and said: "This person is so devoid of virtue as to steal the vessels of the temple of the late emperor. I handed him over to the Commandant of Justice intending to have him and his clan executed, yet you, sir, have sentenced him according to the law. This is not in accordance with my intention of jointly honoring the ancestral temple." Shizhi took off his cap, kowtowed, and apologized, saying: "The law as it is, is sufficient. Moreover, though the crimes are equal, they are differentiated by the degree of defiance and submission. Now, if one who steals a vessel from the ancestral temple is executed along with his clan, what if, one in ten thousand, a foolish person were to take a handful of earth from the tomb of Emperor Gao, how would Your Majesty add to his punishment?" After a long time, Emperor Wen spoke of it with the Empress Dowager and then approved the Commandant of Justice's judgment. At that time, the Commandant of the Capital, the Marquis of Tiao, Zhou Yafu, and the Chancellor of Liang, the Marquis of Shandu, Wang Tiankai, saw that Shizhi held fair opinions in his deliberations, and so they became close friends. Commandant of Justice Zhang was praised by all under Heaven because of this.

Later, Emperor Wen passed away, and Emperor Jing was enthroned. Shizhi was afraid and claimed to be ill. He wished to resign and leave, but feared a great punishment would come; he wished to go and apologize, but did not know what the outcome would be. Following the plan of Wang Sheng, he finally went to apologize, and Emperor Jing did not hold it against him.

Wang Sheng was a man skilled in the words of Huang-Lao and a scholar in retirement. He was once summoned to the court, and all the Three Ducal Ministers and Nine High Ministers stood in attendance. Wang Sheng, an old man, said, "My sock has come untied," and, looking back, said to Commandant of Justice Zhang: "Tie my sock for me!" Shizhi knelt and tied it for him. After it was done, someone said to Wang Sheng: "Why did you alone humiliate Commandant of Justice Zhang in court, making him kneel and tie your sock?" Wang Sheng said: "I am old and of low status, and I know that in the end I can be of no benefit to Commandant of Justice Zhang. Commandant of Justice Zhang is a famous minister of the realm today. I therefore deliberately humiliated the Commandant of Justice, making him kneel and tie my sock, wishing to enhance his reputation." When the high officials heard this, they praised Wang Sheng and held Commandant of Justice Zhang in higher esteem.

Commandant of Justice Zhang served Emperor Jing for over a year and then became the Chancellor to the King of Huainan. He was still held accountable for his past faults. After a long time, Shizhi passed away. His son was named Zhang Zhi, with the style name Changgong. His office reached that of a Grand Master, but he was dismissed. Because he could not curry favor with the people of his time, he did not hold office for the rest of his life.

Feng Tang's grandfather was a man of Zhao. His father moved to Dai. When Han was established, he moved to Anling. Tang was known for his filial piety and served as the Chief of the Palace Attendants, serving Emperor Wen. Emperor Wen's carriage passed by, and he asked Tang: "Sir, why are you a gentleman at your age? Where is your home?" Tang answered him with the full truth. Emperor Wen said: "When I was at Dai, my Supervisor of the Imperial Kitchen, Gao Qu, often spoke to me of the worthiness of the Zhao general Li Qi, who fought at Julu. Now, every time I eat, my thoughts have never left Julu. Do you know of him, sir?" Tang replied: "He is not as good as a general as Lian Po or Li Mu." The emperor said: "Why?" Tang said: "My grandfather, when he was in Zhao, was an officer who was good to Li Mu. My late father was formerly the Chancellor of Dai and was good to the Zhao general Li Qi, so I know the kind of man he is." After the emperor heard about the character of Lian Po and Li Mu, he was very pleased and slapped his thigh, saying: "Alas! I just cannot get Lian Po and Li Mu to be my generals at this time. Why would I worry about the Xiongnu then!" Tang said: "I am your subject, Your Majesty! Even if you had Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to employ them." The emperor was angry, rose, and went into the inner palace. After a long time, he summoned Tang and reproached him, saying: "Why do you insult me in front of everyone? Is there no private place for you to speak?" Tang apologized, saying: "I am a rustic man and do not know of taboos."

At that time, the Xiongnu had recently raided Chona on a large scale and killed the Commandant of Beidi, Ang. The emperor was concerned about the Hu invasion, so he finally asked Tang again: "How do you know that I cannot employ Lian Po and Li Mu?" Tang replied: "I have heard that when the ancient kings dispatched generals, they would kneel and push the carriage wheel, saying: 'Within the gates of the camp, I, the lonely one, control it; outside the gates of the camp, the general controls it.' Military achievements, ranks, and rewards were all decided outside, and only reported upon return. This was not an empty statement. My grandfather said that when Li Mu was a general for Zhao on the frontier, the taxes from the military market were all used by him to feast the soldiers. Rewards and punishments were decided outside, without interference from the center. He was entrusted with responsibility and held accountable for success, and so Li Mu was able to fully use his intelligence and ability. He selected one thousand three hundred chariots, ten thousand three hundred mounted archers, and one hundred thousand soldiers worth a hundred gold each. With this, he drove the Chanyu north, defeated the Donghu, destroyed the Danlin, suppressed the powerful Qin in the west, and checked Han and Wei in the south. At that time, Zhao was nearly a hegemon. Afterwards, when King Qian of Zhao was enthroned, his mother was a singer. When King Qian was enthroned, he listened to the slander of Guo Kai and finally executed Li Mu, ordering Yan Ju to replace him. Because of this, his army was defeated and his soldiers fled north, and he was captured and destroyed by Qin. Now, I have privately heard that Wei Shang is the Governor of Yunzhong. He uses all the taxes from the military market to feast his soldiers, and even spends his own private money. Every five days, he has an ox slaughtered to feast his guests, military officers, and retainers. Because of this, the Xiongnu stay far away and do not approach the passes of Yunzhong. The barbarians once entered, and Shang led his chariots and cavalry to attack them, killing many of their number. The soldiers are all sons of common families, who came from the fields to join the army. How would they know about the tallies and registers? They fight hard all day, capturing heads and taking prisoners, and report their achievements to the headquarters. If a single word does not match, the clerical officials use the law to bind them. Their rewards are not carried out, while the officials' enforcement of the law is certain. I am foolish, and I believe that Your Majesty's laws are too clear, the rewards too light, and the punishments too severe. Moreover, the Governor of Yunzhong, Wei Shang, was convicted because the number of heads and prisoners he reported was off by six. Your Majesty handed him over to the officials, stripped him of his rank, and sentenced him to hard labor. Speaking from this, even if Your Majesty had Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to employ them. I am truly foolish and have violated the taboos. I deserve death, I deserve death!" Emperor Wen was pleased. On that day, he ordered Feng Tang to hold a tally and pardon Wei Shang, reinstating him as the Governor of Yunzhong, and appointed Tang as the Commandant of Chariots and Cavalry, in charge of the chariot soldiers of the Commandant of the Capital and the commanderies and kingdoms.

In the seventh year, Emperor Jing was enthroned, and Tang was made the Chancellor of Chu, but was dismissed. When Emperor Wu was enthroned, he sought worthy and good men and recommended Feng Tang. Tang was then over ninety years old and could no longer serve as an official, so he made Tang's son, Feng Sui, a Gentleman. Sui's style name was Wangsun, and he was also a remarkable man, and he was a friend of mine.

The Grand Historian comments: Zhang Ji's words about elders, upholding the law and not bending to the will of others; and Lord Feng's discourse on generals, how meaningful it is! How meaningful it is! The saying goes, "If you do not know the man, look at his friends." The praise and acclaim of these two gentlemen can be recorded in the court and temple. The Book of Documents says, "Not partial, not partisan, the kingly way is broad; not partisan, not partial, the kingly way is level." Zhang Ji and Lord Feng are close to this.
