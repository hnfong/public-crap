 這段文字出自中國古代哲學家莊子的《inner chapters · 浩然說》。完整的原文如下：

「敢問何謂浩然之氣？」曰：「難言也。其為氣也，至大至剛，以直養而無害，以曲安而無疵，自天地之間，充盈而不窮，攝天地之氣，而與我濟矣。此謂浩然。」

（莊子：浩然說）

翻譯成英文如下：

"What do you mean by the 'spirit of the vast and boundless'?" was asked. The reply was: "That is hard to say. It is the greatest and the strongest of all things, the most upright and the most enduring. It is that which supports and sustains all things, and through it, all things find their full development. It embraces and contains the heavens and the earth, and integrates them with the finest and most subtle energies. This is what is meant by the 'spirit of the vast and boundless.'"
