This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

 [/INST] (1) Translation:

Wei Wuhou (King of Wei) was contemplating a matter and was about to succeed, but his officials could not keep up with him. Upon returning from his audience, he had a look of joy on his face. Wu Qi came forward and said, "Have you ever heard the words of Zhouwang of Chu (King of Chu) from those around you?" Wei Wuhou asked, "What did Zhouwang of Chu say?" Wu Qi replied, "Zhouwang of Chu was contemplating a matter and was about to succeed, but his officials could not keep up with him. Shen Gong Wu Chen asked, 'Your Majesty looks worried after your audience, why is that?' Zhouwang of Chu said, 'I made a decision without sufficient deliberation, and yet my officials could not keep up with me. It is said that 'When a lord can obtain a general on his own, he becomes a king; when he can obtain an ally on his own, he becomes a hegemon; when he can arouse suspicion on his own, he survives; but when he tries to plan by himself, he will perish.' Now, without proper deliberation and yet my officials could not keep up with me, my country is on the brink of ruin. That is why I am worried.' Zhouwang of Chu is worried, but you are joyful, my lord." Wei Wuhou walked around in circles, bowed twice and said, "Heaven has sent this teacher to correct my mistakes."

(2) Moral of the story:

The moral of the story is that a leader should not make decisions without proper deliberation and consultation with his advisors. A leader's success depends on the collective wisdom of his advisors, and making decisions without their input can lead to disastrous consequences.

(3) Western counterpart:

The concept of collective wisdom and consultation with advisors has a counterpart in Western thought, particularly in the concept of the "council of elders" in ancient Greek and Roman societies. The idea is that a leader should seek the advice of experienced and knowledgeable individuals before making important decisions. This concept is also reflected in the modern practice of forming a cabinet of advisors in democratic societies. Additionally, the idea of collective wisdom is also present in the concept of "deliberative democracy," where decisions are made through a process of deliberation and discussion among citizens.
