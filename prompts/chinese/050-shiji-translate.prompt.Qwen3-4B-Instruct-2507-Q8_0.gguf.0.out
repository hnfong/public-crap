The Biography of Zhang Shi-Zhi and Feng Tang

Zhang Shi-Zhi, the Grand Justice, was from Duyang, and his given name was Ji. He had an elder brother named Zhong, who lived with him. Zhang served as a cavalry officer under Emperor Xiaowen, but after ten years he was not assigned any official post and remained unknown. Zhang said: "After long service, my elder brother's property has been diminished; my ambitions have not been fulfilled." He wished to resign and return home. The middle-ranking general Yuan Ang recognized Zhang's talent and regretted his departure, so he requested that Zhang be transferred to serve as a messenger. After completing his morning court duties, Zhang spoke to the emperor about matters of state. Emperor Xiaowen said: "Do not speak too highly or abstractly; your suggestions must be practical and implementable." Thus, Zhang spoke at length about the rise and fall of the Qin and Han dynasties, explaining in detail why Qin declined and Han succeeded. Emperor Xiaowen praised his remarks and appointed Zhang as the Messenger-Attendant.

While accompanying the emperor on a journey, they visited the tiger enclosure. The emperor asked the officer in charge of the Upper Forest to provide a list of animals and birds, asking over ten questions. The officer looked around, unable to answer any. The supervisor of the tiger enclosure stepped forward and answered all the questions with great fluency, aiming to demonstrate his ability to respond instantly and fluently. The emperor said: "Can officials be this incompetent? The officer is a disgrace!" He then ordered Zhang to appoint the supervisor as the official in charge of the Upper Forest. Zhang had previously said: "Your Majesty, how would you describe Jiao Hou Zhou Bo?" The emperor replied: "He is a respectable man." Zhang then asked: "How about Dongyang Hou Zhang Xiang?" The emperor replied again: "He is also a respectable man." Zhang said: "Jiao Hou and Dongyang Hou are both called respectable men. Yet these two men, when discussing matters, cannot even utter a word. How can they compare to this supervisor, who speaks fluently and with ease? Moreover, Qin relied on officials who handled documents and records; these officials competed with each other by emphasizing speed, rigor, and strictness, but their result was merely formalities without genuine compassion. Thus, no one heard of their faults, and the dynasty gradually declined until the second emperor, when the empire collapsed. Now, Your Majesty appoints this supervisor to a high office merely because of his eloquence. I fear that the entire country will follow the trend, striving for verbal skill without substance. And the influence of the lower ranks on the upper ranks is swift and powerful—every decision must be carefully considered." Emperor Xiaowen said: "Well said." And thus, the appointment of the supervisor was canceled.

On the way to the palace, the emperor called Zhang to ride beside him, and they proceeded slowly. The emperor asked Zhang about the weaknesses of Qin. Zhang gave a detailed and sincere account. Upon arriving at the palace, Emperor Xiaowen appointed Zhang as the official in charge of the imperial carriage.

A short time later, the Crown Prince and Prince of Liang arrived together to enter the capital, but they did not pass through the gate of the Commander of the Army. Zhang then pursued them and stopped them from entering the palace gate, accusing them of disrespect for the official gate. He submitted the case to the emperor. Empress Bo heard of this and, upon hearing it, Emperor Xiaowen removed his hat and apologized, saying: "I failed to properly educate my son." Empress Bo then sent envoys to issue an order to pardon the Crown Prince and Prince of Liang, after which they were allowed to enter. Thus, Emperor Xiaowen greatly admired Zhang and appointed him as a mid-level official.

Later, Zhang was promoted to the position of middle-ranking general. While accompanying the emperor to Ba陵, he stayed near the latrine area. At that time, the Empress Shen was accompanying the emperor. The emperor pointed to the road to Xin Feng and said: "This is the road to Handan." He then had the Empress Shen play the zither, and he leaned on the zither and sang, his expression sorrowful and melancholy. Turning to his court officials, he said: "Alas! If we use stones from the northern mountain to build a coffin, and cover it with straw and wax, how could it ever be moved?" All around said: "Well said." Zhang stepped forward and said: "If there is something desirable within the coffin, even if it is sealed with stone from the northern mountain, there will still be a way to open it. If there is nothing desirable within, then even without a stone coffin, why should we be sad?" Emperor Xiaowen approved. Later, Zhang was appointed as the Grand Justice.

A short time later, the emperor was traveling across the central Wei Bridge when a man emerged from beneath the bridge, causing the imperial carriage's horses to startle. The emperor ordered the cavalry to capture the man and handed him over to the Grand Justice. Zhang investigated and found that the man had come from the county, heard the imperial procession, hid beneath the bridge, thought the procession had passed, and then came out to see the imperial carriage and horses, and fled. The official of the court sentenced him to a fine. Emperor Xiaowen was angry and said: "This man directly startled my horse. My horse is gentle and docile; if it were not, another horse would have been damaged. Yet the Grand Justice is sentencing him to a fine!" Zhang replied: "The law is something shared by the emperor and the people. If the law is like this and we make it even harsher, then the law will not be trusted by the people. Moreover, at that time, if the emperor had ordered immediate execution, that would have been sufficient. Now that the case has been handed over to the Grand Justice, the Grand Justice is the standard of fairness for the entire country. If one decision is biased, then all laws will be seen as light or heavy, and the people will have no place to stand. I beg Your Majesty to consider this carefully." After a long pause, the emperor said: "The Grand Justice's judgment is correct."

Later, someone stole a jade ring from before the high temple. The man was caught, and Emperor Xiaowen was furious. He handed the case over to the Grand Justice. Zhang, according to the law, reported that stealing temple items for use was punishable by death. The emperor was extremely angry and said: "People have no regard for morality—stealing from the temple of the previous emperor! I appointed the Grand Justice to deal with such cases to ensure the family is exterminated. Yet you are using the law to report a death sentence. This is not what I intended to share with the ancestors!" Zhang removed his hat and bowed deeply, apologizing: "The law is as it is. The crime is the same, but the punishment differs based on whether it is a rebellion or a minor offense. If someone steals from the temple and is punished by extermination, even if it is only one in a hundred thousand cases, what if a common person takes a handful of soil from Changling? How would Your Majesty punish such a person?" After a long time, Emperor Xiaowen and Empress Bo discussed the matter, and finally agreed to the Grand Justice's judgment. At that time, the Commander of the Military, Zhou Ya-fu, and the Governor of Liang, Wang Tan-kai, saw that Zhang's judgment was fair and impartial, and thus formed a close friendship. Zhang Shi-Zhi thus gained widespread acclaim throughout the country.

After Emperor Xiaowen's death, Emperor Jing ascended the throne. Zhang feared for his safety and claimed illness. He wanted to resign, fearing a severe punishment; yet he did not know what would happen if he tried to apologize. He followed the advice of Wang Sheng and finally apologized, and Emperor Jing did not punish him.

Wang Sheng was a scholar who specialized in the teachings of Huang-Lao. He once was invited to stay in the court. All the three senior officials and the nine ministers gathered. Wang Sheng, an old man, said: "I have untied my shoelaces." He turned to Zhang Shi-Zhi and said: "Please tie my shoelaces for me!" Zhang bowed and tied them. Afterward, someone said to Wang Sheng: "Why did you humiliate Zhang Shi-Zhi in the court, making him kneel and tie your shoelaces?" Wang Sheng replied: "I am old and of low status. I judge that I will not benefit Zhang Shi-Zhi. Zhang Shi-Zhi is currently one of the most renowned officials in the country. Therefore, I lightly humiliated him, making him kneel and tie my shoelaces, in order to show my respect." The ministers heard this and admired Wang Sheng and greatly respected Zhang Shi-Zhi.

Zhang Shi-Zhi served under Emperor Jing for over a year, serving as the Governor of Huainan. He still held onto the past grievances. After a long time, Zhang died. His son was Zhang Zhi, with the courtesy name Changgong. He held the position of a scholar-official but was later dismissed. Because he could not adapt to the current times, he never held any official position again.

Feng Tang was the great-grandfather of a man from Zhao. His father moved to Dai. After the Han dynasty was established, the family moved to Anling. Feng was known for his filial piety and served as the head of the middle-ranking officials under Emperor Xiaowen. When the emperor passed by, he asked Feng: "How did your parents become officials? Where is your family from?" Feng gave a truthful account. The emperor said: "When I was in Dai, my food supervisor Gao Qu often told me about the excellence of Zhao's general Li Qi, who fought at Julu. Now every time I eat, I cannot help but think of Julu. Do you know this?" Feng replied: "Even less than Li Pi or Li Mu as generals." The emperor asked: "Why?" Feng said: "My great-grandfather, when he was in Zhao, served as a military commander and was very familiar with Li Mu. My father, who once served as the governor of Dai, was also familiar with Zhao's general Li Qi, and knew his character." After hearing about Li Pi and Li Mu, the emperor was greatly pleased and pounded his thigh, saying: "Alas! If only I had Li Pi or Li Mu as my generals at that time, how could I worry about the Xiongnu!" Feng said: "Your Majesty! Even if you had Li Pi or Li Mu, you would not be able to use them." The emperor was angry and stood up to enter the palace. After a long time, he summoned Feng and scolded him: "How can you publicly insult me? Is there no place where I can be left alone?" Feng apologized: "I am ignorant of taboos."

At that time, the Xiongnu had recently invaded Chao Na, killing the Governor of Beidie, Meng. The emperor was deeply concerned about the northern barbarians and finally asked Feng again: "Why do you know that I cannot use Li Pi or Li Mu?" Feng replied: "I have heard that in ancient times, when kings sent generals, they would kneel and push the carriage wheel, saying: 'Within the palace walls, the sovereign controls it; outside the palace walls, the general controls it. All military achievements and rewards are decided outside, and then reported back. This is not empty talk. My great-grandfather said that Li Mu, as a general of Zhao, stationed at the frontier, used all the revenue from the military market to feed the soldiers, and all rewards were decided outside, without interference from the central office. With full trust and responsibility, Li Mu was able to fully utilize his talents. He sent out a thousand three hundred chariots, ten thousand three hundred cavalry, and ten thousand elite soldiers. Thus, he pushed back the Xiongnu, defeated the Donghu, destroyed Danlin, restrained the powerful Qin to the west, and defended against the states of Han and Wei to the south. At that time, Zhao nearly became dominant. Later, when King Xian was established, his mother was a courtesan. After King Xian ascended the throne, he was influenced by Guo Kai's slander and eventually executed Li Mu, replacing him with Yan Ju. As a result, the army was defeated and the soldiers were driven north, and Zhao was eventually conquered by Qin. I have recently heard that Fu Shang, the governor of Yunzhong, used all the revenue from the military market to feed the soldiers and officers, and also used private funds to host banquets every five days for guests, officers, and soldiers. As a result, the Xiongnu stayed far away and did not come near the Yunzhong frontier. When the Xiongnu once invaded, Fu Shang led his cavalry to attack and killed many of them. The soldiers were all sons of ordinary families who joined the army from the fields. How could they know the military records or the ranks? They fought all day, killed enemies, captured prisoners, and reported their achievements to the central office. But if their reports did not match, the civil officials would use the law to punish them. The rewards were not properly distributed, while the civil officials strictly enforced the law. I believe that Your Majesty's laws are too strict, rewards too light, and punishments too severe. Moreover, Fu Shang, the governor of Yunzhong, was punished for a minor error in reporting the number of enemy heads captured—six levels less than the official record. Your Majesty sent him to the civil officials, who stripped his rank and made him serve as a laborer. From this, I conclude that even if Your Majesty had Li Pi or Li Mu, you would not be able to use them. I am truly ignorant and have offended the taboos. I beg for death!" Emperor Xiaowen was pleased. That day, he ordered Feng Tang to carry a decree to pardon Fu Shang and restore him as the governor of Yunzhong, and appointed Feng Tang as the Commander of the Cavalry, in charge of the Commander of the Military and the cavalry of the provinces and states.

In the seventh year, Emperor Jing ascended the throne and appointed Feng Tang as the Governor of Chu, who was later dismissed. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne, he sought talented men and recommended Feng Tang. At that time, Feng was over ninety years old and could no longer serve in office. Thus, Feng's son, Feng Sui, was appointed as a court official. Sui had the courtesy name Wangsun and was also a remarkable person, and he was friendly with me.

The historian said: Zhang Ji's statement about "respectable men" reflects adherence to the law without favoritism; Feng Gong's discussion of generals is truly profound! Truly profound! It is said: 'One cannot know a person without knowing his friends.' The two gentlemen are praised for their wisdom and virtue and deserve to be recorded in the halls of government. The Book says: 'Not biased, not partisan—this is the open and broad path of the king's way; not partisan, not biased—this is the smooth path of the king's way.' Zhang Ji and Feng Gong have come close to this ideal. [end of text]
