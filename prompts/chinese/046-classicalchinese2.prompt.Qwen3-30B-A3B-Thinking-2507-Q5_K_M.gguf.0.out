Okay, the user has shared a passage from Xunzi (荀子) and asked for three specific things: an English translation keeping Chinese names, an explanation of the moral, and whether the concept has a counterpart in Western thought. 

First, I need to verify this is indeed from Xunzi. *checks mental database* Yes, this is a famous anecdote from Xunzi's "Wu Zhi" chapter. The user seems to be studying Chinese philosophy - probably a student or enthusiast. They're being very precise with their request, which suggests they want academic rigor.

For the translation part, I should maintain the classical Chinese names like "Wu Qi" (吳起) and "Chu Zhuang Wang" (楚莊王) as requested. The tricky part is "中蘬" - that's "Zhonghui" (中蘬) which refers to a historical figure, so I'll keep it as is. Need to be careful with the quote about "teachers, friends, doubts" - that's a key philosophical point.

Hmm... the moral is clearly about humility in leadership. The Chu Zhuang Wang's worry versus Wei Wu Hou's pride is the core contrast. I should emphasize how Xunzi uses this to argue against self-satisfaction. 

For the Western counterpart... *thinks* Ah! The Stoics had similar ideas - Seneca's "the more you know, the more you realize you don't know" concept. And Machiavelli's "prince must be feared" but wait no, that's different. Better stick with Socrates' "I know that I know nothing" as the clearest parallel. 

*double-checks* Wait, the user said "European" thought specifically, so I should avoid mentioning Eastern parallels. The Socratic paradox is perfect - it's from ancient Greece, fits the timeframe, and matches the humility theme exactly. 

*notices potential trap* Must clarify that while Machiavelli wrote about leadership, his focus was on power tactics, not humility. The user would want precise academic comparison, not loose parallels. 

For the translation, I'll keep the dialogue format intact. The "reverently bowed twice" (逡巡再拜) is important - shows Wei Wu Hou's change of heart. Should render that as "hesitantly bowed twice" to capture the nuance. 

*verifies historical accuracy* Yes, Chu Zhuang Wang was a real ruler of Chu state, and Wu Qi was his minister. The anecdote is historically attributed to Xunzi's school. Good, no need to flag it as apocryphal. 

The user seems detail-oriented - they'll appreciate the footnote about "中蘬" being a person. I'll add that in the translation notes. Also should explain "not worthy" (不穀) as Chu Zhuang's humble self-reference. 

*considers deeper needs* They're probably preparing for a philosophy paper or exam. The three-part request suggests they need both content and conceptual analysis. I'll make sure the moral explanation connects directly to Xunzi's broader philosophy about human nature and governance. 

For the Western comparison, I'll explicitly state why it's not Machiavelli but Socrates - that distinction matters academically. The user would lose points if they confused those. 

*checks word count* The translation should be concise but preserve all key terms. The "teacher/ally/doubt" quote is the most important part - must get that right. "得師者王" = "those who gain teachers become kings" etc. 

Final check: Yes, the moral is about humility preventing downfall, Western parallel is Socratic ignorance. Got it. Time to structure the response clearly in three numbered parts as requested.

Here is the requested analysis of the passage from *Xunzi*:

---

### (1) English Translation (with Chinese names retained)  
Wei Wu Hou planned affairs with great success, and no minister could match his wisdom. After returning from court, he wore an expression of joy. Wu Qi approached and said: "Have you ever heard the words of Chu Zhuang Wang spoken to his attendants?" Wu Hou replied, "What did Chu Zhuang Wang say?" Wu Qi answered: "Chu Zhuang Wang planned affairs with great success, and no minister could match his wisdom. After returning from court, he wore an expression of *anxiety*. Shen Gong Wucheng approached and asked, 'Why does Your Majesty wear an anxious expression after court?' Chu Zhuang Wang said, 'I, unworthy as I am, planned affairs with great success, and no minister could match me. That is why I am anxious. The words of Zhonghui in the *Zhonghui* say: *“A ruler who gains teachers becomes a king; who gains friends becomes a hegemon; who gains doubters preserves the state; who acts alone, thinking none can match him, will perish.”* Now, with my unworthiness, and no minister matching me, our state is nearly lost! That is why I am anxious.' Chu Zhuang Wang was anxious, yet Your Majesty is joyful."  
Wei Wu Hou hesitated, then bowed twice and said: "Heaven has sent your words to correct my faults."

### (2) Moral of the Story  
The core moral is **the danger of self-satisfaction in leadership**.  
- **Chu Zhuang Wang’s wisdom**: He recognized that *no minister matching his wisdom* signaled a grave danger—his state lacked critical voices to challenge his decisions. His anxiety reflected humility and awareness of the *necessity of diverse perspectives* to prevent collapse.  
- **Wei Wu Hou’s folly**: His joy revealed *arrogance*—he mistook his own competence for the state’s strength, ignoring the absence of dissenting voices. This complacency, as Chu Zhuang Wang warned, invites ruin.  
- **Xunzi’s philosophical point**: True governance requires *self-critique* and *reliance on others’ wisdom*. A ruler who believes he is infallible (thinking "none can match me") is already doomed. The story underscores Xunzi’s belief that human nature is prone to error, and *only through humility and learning from others* can a state thrive.

### (3) Counterpart in Western (European) Thought  
**Yes, the concept has a direct counterpart in Socratic philosophy.**  
- **Socrates’ "I know that I know nothing"** (from Plato’s *Apology*):  
  Socrates famously claimed his wisdom lay in recognizing his own ignorance. He argued that *true knowledge begins with the awareness of one’s limitations*. This mirrors Chu Zhuang Wang’s anxiety: both reject self-satisfaction and embrace humility as the foundation of wisdom.  
- **Key parallel**:  
  | **Xunzi (Chinese)** | **Socrates (Western)** |  
  |---|---|  
  | "Those who act alone, thinking none can match them, will perish." | "The unexamined life is not worth living." (Socrates) |  
  | Anxiety over lacking "doubters" (critical voices) | Humility as the path to wisdom |  
  | Governance requires *external checks* | Knowledge requires *self-examination* |  

- **Why not Machiavelli?**  
  Machiavelli’s *The Prince* (1513) emphasizes *pragmatic power* (e.g., "it is better to be feared than loved"), but *not* humility. His focus is on control, not self-awareness—making Socrates the closer parallel.  
- **Later Western echoes**:  
  - **Seneca** (Stoic, 1st c. CE): "The greatest danger is to think you are safe."  
  - **Voltaire**: "Doubt is the beginning of wisdom."  
  - **Modern leadership theory**: The "Dunning-Kruger effect" (overestimating one’s competence) directly contradicts the story’s lesson.

### Summary  
This passage from *Xunzi* warns that **leadership without humility is self-destructive**. Its moral—*true strength lies in recognizing one’s ignorance and seeking others’ wisdom*—resonates powerfully with Socratic philosophy and remains a timeless lesson in governance. The contrast between Chu Zhuang Wang’s anxiety and Wei Wu Hou’s joy is not just a historical anecdote, but a universal critique of arrogance. [end of text]
