The Biography of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang  
Zhang Shizhi, the Chief Justice, was from Duyang, with the name Ji. He had an elder brother named Zhong who lived together with him. He became a cavalry officer by virtue of his wealth, served Emperor Wen of Han, and for ten years was not promoted, and was not well known. Zhang Shizhi said, "Long service has reduced my brother's property, and it is not successful." He wanted to resign and return home. The middle officer Yuan Ang knew his virtue, and regretted his departure, so he requested that Zhang Shizhi be transferred to serve as a court official. After Zhang Shizhi had finished his court duties, he approached and spoke about matters of benefit. Emperor Wen said, "Be modest, do not speak too highly, and make sure that what you say can be implemented now." Thus Zhang Shizhi spoke about events between the Qin and Han dynasties, explaining why the Qin fell and the Han rose, for a long time. Emperor Wen praised him, and then appointed Zhang Shizhi as the Chief Court Official.  

Zhang Shizhi accompanied the emperor on a journey, and they climbed the tiger enclosure. The emperor asked the chief of the imperial park about the list of animals, and asked more than ten questions. The chief looked around, and could not answer. A tiger enclosure keeper from the side answered the emperor's questions about the animal list very thoroughly, wanting to show his ability to respond quickly and fluently. Emperor Wen said, "Is this the way an official should be? The chief is a fool!" He then ordered Zhang Shizhi to appoint the keeper as the chief of the imperial park. Zhang Shizhi said after a long time, "Your Majesty, how do you regard General Zhang Bo, the Duke of Jinghou?" The emperor said, "He is a man of integrity." He then asked again, "How do you regard Zhang Xiang, the Duke of Dongyang?" The emperor again said, "He is a man of integrity." Zhang Shizhi said, "General Zhang Bo and the Duke of Dongyang are called men of integrity, yet they could not even speak when giving advice. How can they be compared to this keeper who is talkative and quick-witted? Moreover, the Qin dynasty relied on officials who were skilled in writing, and officials competed to be quick, strict, and meticulous, but the result was only formalities without compassion. Therefore, people did not know their mistakes, and the dynasty declined to the second emperor, and the whole country collapsed. Now Your Majesty promotes this keeper for his eloquence, I fear that the whole country will follow the trend, compete for eloquence without substance. Moreover, the influence of the lower ranks on the upper ranks is faster than the echo of a shadow. Therefore, your decisions must not be careless." Emperor Wen said, "Good." Then he stopped from appointing the keeper.  

The emperor got into the carriage, summoned Zhang Shizhi to ride with him, and they traveled slowly, asking Zhang Shizhi about the drawbacks of the Qin dynasty. Zhang Shizhi spoke in detail. When they arrived at the palace, Emperor Wen appointed Zhang Shizhi as the Chief of the Imperial Carriage.  

Soon after, the crown prince and the Prince of Liang rode together into court, and did not lower their carriage at the司马 gate. Zhang Shizhi pursued and stopped the crown prince and the Prince of Liang from entering the palace gate. He then accused them of not showing respect and submitted the report. Empress Bo heard of this, and Emperor Wen removed his hat and apologized, saying, "I taught my son improperly." Empress Bo then sent an envoy to issue an imperial decree to pardon the crown prince and the Prince of Liang, and they were allowed to enter. Emperor Wen thus found Zhang Shizhi remarkable and appointed him as the Middle Doctor.  

Soon after, he was promoted to the position of Middle Officer. They traveled to Baoling, and he stayed near the northern toilet. At that time, Shen Fu Ren was with the emperor. The emperor pointed to the new road to Xinfeng for Shen Fu Ren, saying, "This is the road to Handan." He had Shen Fu Ren play the zither, and the emperor himself played the zither and sang, his mood sad and melancholic. He looked around and said to the ministers, "Alas! If the coffin is made of northern mountain stone, and the silk is used to wrap the body, and the lacquer is painted in between, how could it be moved?" The ministers all said, "Good." Zhang Shizhi stepped forward and said, "If there is something desirable inside, even if it is locked in the southern mountains, there would be a way out. If there is nothing desirable inside, even without a stone coffin, why should we be worried?" Emperor Wen praised him. Later, he was appointed as the Chief Justice.  

Soon after, the emperor went out from the middle bridge of Wei River, and a man ran out from under the bridge, causing the imperial carriage's horse to be startled. The emperor ordered the cavalry to capture him and sent him to the Chief Justice. Zhang Shizhi investigated and questioned him. The man said, "I am a county resident. I heard the imperial procession and hid under the bridge. After a long time, I thought the procession had passed, so I came out and saw the imperial carriage and horses, and ran away." The Chief Justice Qin judged that the man had violated the imperial procession and should be fined. Emperor Wen was angry and said, "This man frightened my horse. My horse is gentle and docile. If it had been another horse, it would surely have been injured. But the Chief Justice judged him only to be fined!" Zhang Shizhi said, "The law is something shared by the emperor and the people. Now the law is like this, but if it is changed to be heavier, the law will not be trusted by the people. Moreover, at that time, if the emperor had ordered him to be executed immediately, that would have been sufficient. Now that he has been sent to the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice is the standard of justice in the country. If one case is wrongly judged, then the whole country will use the law as light or heavy, and the people will not know where to place their hands and feet. Please Your Majesty consider this carefully." After a long time, the emperor said, "The Chief Justice's judgment is correct."  

Later, someone stole a jade ring from the front of the High Temple. He was caught, and Emperor Wen was angry, and sent him to the Chief Justice for punishment. Zhang Shizhi examined the law and found that the person who stole the temple's ceremonial items should be sentenced to death. Emperor Wen was very angry and said, "How unrighteous people are! They stole the temple items of the former emperor. We sent them to the Chief Justice, intending to execute them, but you judged them by the law, which is not what I intended for the temple." Zhang Shizhi removed his hat and knelt to apologize, saying, "The law is sufficient." Moreover, the crime is equal, but the difference is in the nature of the crime. Now, if someone steals the temple's items and is executed, there is only a small chance of that happening. Suppose an ignorant person takes a handful of soil from Changling, how would you punish him?" After a long time, Emperor Wen and Empress Bo discussed this, and then allowed the Chief Justice's judgment. At that time, the Chief Inspector Tao Hou Zhou Yafu and the Minister of the State Liang Xiang Shan Du Hou Wang Tiantai saw Zhang Shizhi's arguments as fair, and thus became close friends. Zhang Shizhi was thus praised throughout the country.  

After Emperor Wen's death, Emperor Jing took the throne, and Zhang Shizhi was afraid, and claimed illness. He wanted to resign, fearing a great punishment; he wanted to apologize, but did not know how. He followed Wang Sheng's advice and finally went to apologize, but Emperor Jing did not take it seriously.  

Wang Sheng was a man who practiced the Yellow and Black doctrines, and was a recluse. He was once summoned to the court, and the three dukes and nine ministers were all present. Wang Sheng, an old man, said, "My shoe laces are loose." He turned to Zhang Shizhi and said, "Please tie my shoe laces for me." Zhang Shizhi knelt and tied them. After that, someone told Wang Sheng, "Why did you humiliate Zhang Shizhi in court and make him kneel to tie your shoe laces?" Wang Sheng said, "I am old and lowly, and I judged that I would not be of any help to Zhang Shizhi. Zhang Shizhi is a famous official in the country now. I therefore humiliated him, making him kneel to tie my shoe laces, to honor him." The ministers heard this, and considered Wang Sheng to be virtuous and respected Zhang Shizhi.  

Zhang Shizhi served Emperor Jing for more than a year, and was the governor of the Prince of Huainan, still remembering his previous mistakes. After a long time, Zhang Shizhi died. His son was Zhang Zhi, with the name Changgong, who held the position of a doctor, but was later dismissed. Because he could not be accepted by the world, he never held office again.  

Feng Tang was from Zhao, his grandfather. His father moved to Dai. After the Han dynasty was established, he moved to Anling. Feng Tang was known for his filial piety, and was appointed as the head of the Middle Officer's Office, serving Emperor Wen. Emperor Wen rode by and asked Feng Tang, "How did your father become a court official? Where is your home?" Feng Tang answered truthfully. Emperor Wen said, "When I was in Dai, my chief of food, Gao Qu, often told me about the virtue of General Li Qi of Zhao, who fought under the Julu Mountains. Now, every time I eat, my mind is not on anything else but Julu. Does your father know this?" Feng Tang answered, "He is not as good as General Lian Po and General Li Mu." The emperor said, "Why?" Feng Tang answered, "My grandfather was an official in Zhao, and was the commander of the army, and was good with General Li Mu. My father was once the minister of Dai, and was good with General Li Qi of Zhao, and knew his character." After hearing about Lian Po and Li Mu, the emperor was very pleased, and he tapped his thighs, saying, "Alas! I alone cannot have Lian Po and Li Mu as my generals at this time. Then I would not worry about the Xiongnu!" Feng Tang said, "Your Majesty! Even if you could get Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them." The emperor was angry and rose to enter the inner palace. After a long time, he summoned Feng Tang and scolded him, saying, "Why did you publicly insult me? Why don't you have a private place?" Feng Tang apologized, "I am a foolish man who does not know the rules."  

At that time, the Xiongnu had newly invaded Chao Na, killing the commander of Beidi, Wang. The emperor was concerned about the Xiongnu, and finally asked Feng Tang again, "How do you know that I cannot use Lian Po and Li Mu?" Feng Tang answered, "I have heard that in the ancient kings, when sending generals, they would kneel and push the chariot, saying, 'Within the gate, I control it; outside the gate, the general controls it. Military achievements, ranks, and rewards are decided outside, and then reported back.' This is not empty talk. My grandfather said that Li Mu was the general of Zhao, stationed at the border, and the taxes from the market were all used to feed the soldiers. Rewards and punishments were decided outside, without interference from the center. He was entrusted with responsibility and held accountable for results, so Li Mu was able to fully use his intelligence, sending 1,300 chariots, 13,000 cavalry, and 100,000 soldiers who were worth a hundred gold. Thus, he drove the Xiongnu north, defeated the Eastern Hu, destroyed the Danlin, suppressed the strong Qin to the west, and supported Han and Wei to the south. At that time, Zhao was almost a hegemon. Later, when King Wang Qian was enthroned, his mother was a singer. When King Wang Qian was enthroned, he used Guo Kai's slander, and finally executed Li Mu, and appointed Yan Ju to replace him. Thus, the army was defeated, and the soldiers fled north, and Zhao was captured and destroyed by Qin. Now I have heard that Wei Shang, the governor of Yunzhong, used all the market taxes to feed the soldiers, and privately used the money to raise funds, and sacrificed a cow every five days to entertain guests, military officials, and attendants. Thus, the Xiongnu avoided Yunzhong and did not approach the border. When the Xiongnu once entered, Wei Shang led his chariots and cavalry to attack them, killing many of them. The soldiers were all the sons of the people, who came from the fields to join the army, and did not know the military records and the ranks. They fought all day, cutting off heads and capturing prisoners, and reported their achievements to the military office, but the records did not match. The officials used the law to punish them. Their rewards were not given, but the officials strictly followed the law. I think that Your Majesty's laws are too clear, the rewards are too light, and the punishments are too heavy. Moreover, Wei Shang, the governor of Yunzhong, was sentenced to six ranks less for the number of prisoners captured, and was sent to the officials, his title was reduced, and he was punished. From this, I think that even if Your Majesty could get Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them. I am truly foolish, and I have touched on something that is taboo. I am guilty of a capital crime, a capital crime!" Emperor Wen was pleased. That day, he ordered Feng Tang to hold the imperial seal to pardon Wei Shang, and appointed him as the governor of Yunzhong, and appointed Feng Tang as the Commander of the Horse, in charge of the Chief Inspector and the cavalry of the states and kingdoms.  

Seven years later, Emperor Jing took the throne, and appointed Feng Tang as the governor of Chu, but he was dismissed. When Emperor Wu took the throne, he sought virtuous men and recommended Feng Tang. At that time, Feng Tang was over ninety years old and could not be appointed again, so he appointed his son Feng Sui as a court official. Sui's name was Wangsun, and he was also a remarkable man, and he was friendly with me.  

The Grand Historian said: Zhang Ji's words are those of a man of integrity, who adheres to the law without bending to the emperor's will; Feng Gong's discussion of generals is profound and meaningful! Meaningful! The saying goes, "Do not know a person, look at his friends." The two gentlemen's praise and commendation are worthy of being recorded in the halls of the court. The Book of Documents says, "Not biased, not partisan, the way of the king is vast and open; not partisan, not biased, the way of the king is smooth and easy." Zhang Ji and Feng Gong are close to this. [end of text]
