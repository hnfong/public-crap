**The Biographies of Zhang Shi Zhi and Feng Tang**

Zhang Shi Zhi, also known as Zhang Tingwei, was from Duyang and styled Ji. He had an elder brother named Zhong, with whom he lived together. Zhang Shi Zhi served Emperor Xiaowen as a cavalry officer but was not promoted for ten years and remained unknown. He said, “Having served in the imperial court for so long has only reduced my brother Zhong’s wealth; I have not achieved anything significant.” He wished to resign and return home. Yuan Ang, a high-ranking official, recognized Zhang Shi Zhi’s talents and regretted his departure, so he requested that Zhang Shi Zhi be transferred to a different position. After Zhang Shi Zhi’s audience with the emperor, he spoke about various matters of state. Emperor Xiaowen said, “Do not speak too highly; what you suggest can be put into practice immediately.” Zhang Shi Zhi then discussed the rise and fall of the Qin and Han dynasties at length. The emperor praised his insights and appointed him as the chief clerk.

Once, during a trip, Zhang Shi Zhi accompanied the emperor to the tiger enclosure. The emperor asked about the records of the various animals kept there, but the officials present could not answer his questions. A keeper from the enclosure answered all the emperor’s questions in great detail, demonstrating his ability to respond quickly and confidently. The emperor remarked, “Shouldn’t officials be like this? The official in charge is truly incompetent!” He then ordered Zhang Shi Zhi to promote the keeper to the position of supervisor of the imperial park.

Later, the emperor asked, “What do you think of Marquis Zhou Bo?” Zhang Shi Zhi replied, “He is an elderly man.” When asked about Marquis Zhang of Dongyang, he also said, “He is an elderly man.” The emperor commented, “Although both Marquis Zhou Bo and Marquis Zhang are considered elderly, they were unable to articulate their thoughts clearly; yet this keeper can speak so eloquently. In the Qin dynasty, officials who were skilled in writing and paperwork competed with each other in being harsh and meticulous, but their efforts were merely superficial and lacked genuine compassion. As a result, the dynasty declined. Now you have promoted a man who is good at speaking; I fear that others will follow suit and focus on mere eloquence without substance.” The emperor agreed and decided not to promote the keeper.

Another time, as the emperor was riding in his carriage, Zhang Shi Zhi was called to join him. On the way, the emperor asked about the shortcomings of the Qin dynasty. Upon arriving at the palace, the emperor appointed Zhang Shi Zhi as the supervisor of the imperial carriage.

Later, the crown prince and the Prince of Liang entered the palace together but did not stop at the gate. Zhang Shi Zhi prevented them from entering, citing a lack of respect. When Empress Dowager Bo heard about this, Emperor Xiaowen removed his crown in apology and ordered the princes to be pardoned. From then on, the emperor held Zhang Shi Zhi in high regard and appointed him as a senior court official.

At another occasion, when the emperor was crossing the Wei River, a man ran out from under the bridge, startling the emperor’s carriage. Zhang Shi Zhi was responsible for investigating the incident and found that the man had hidden under the bridge, thinking the emperor’s carriage had passed. The emperor was angry and wanted the man to be fined for disturbing the emperor’s journey. Zhang Shi Zhi argued that the law was meant to be applied fairly to all, and altering it would undermine its credibility. After some deliberation, the emperor agreed with Zhang Shi Zhi’s judgment.

Later, someone stole a jade ring from the ancestral temple. Zhang Shi Zhi recommended that the thief be punished according to the law, but the emperor disagreed, saying that such a minor offense should not be dealt with so harshly. Zhang Shi Zhi pointed out that the law was meant to be impartial. When Emperor Xiaowen eventually agreed with Zhang Shi Zhi’s judgment, he appointed him as the chief justice.

After Emperor Xiaowen’s death, Emperor Jing ascended the throne. Zhang Shi Zhi, fearing retribution, pretended to be ill and wished to resign. He eventually met with the emperor to apologize, and Emperor Jing was lenient towards him.

Feng Tang’s grandfather was from Zhao, and his father was relocated to Dai. During the Han dynasty’s rise, Feng Tang served as the head of the imperial guards and served Emperor Xiaowen. When the emperor passed by, he asked about his family’s background. Feng Tang provided a detailed account. The emperor praised his father’s bravery and mentioned that his father had often spoken well of the generals Li Qi and others during the Battle of Julu. Feng Tang also mentioned that his father knew of the merits of generals like Lian Po and Li Mu. The emperor was impressed and appointed Feng Tang as a court official.

Feng Tang later became a high-ranking official and accompanied the emperor on a trip to Baling. During the journey, the emperor showed him the new road to Xinfeng and played the se on the way, expressing his sorrowful feelings. Zhang Shi Zhi suggested that even if the road were made of stone, it would not be of much use if it had no value; conversely, even without a stone structure, it would not be a cause for worry. The emperor agreed with his view.

Later, someone stole an object from the ancestral temple. Zhang Shi Zhi recommended a moderate punishment, but the emperor disagreed, saying that the law should not be applied so leniently. After some discussion, the emperor finally agreed with Zhang Shi Zhi’s judgment.

After Emperor Xiaowen’s death, Emperor Jing appointed Zhang Shi Zhi as the chief justice. Feng Tang’s wisdom and judgment were widely recognized, and he became a respected figure in the court.

When Emperor Jing died, Zhang Shi Zhi feared for his own safety and considered resigning. He eventually met with the emperor to apologize, and Emperor Jing was gracious towards him.

Feng Tang was a scholar who specialized in the teachings of Laozi and Confucius. Once, when the three dukes and nine ministers gathered, Feng Tang suggested that Zhang Shi Zhi should be humiliated as a way to show respect for his wisdom. Zhang Shi Zhi humbled himself to fulfill this request. Later, someone questioned why Zhang Shi Zhi had been humiliated in public, but Feng Tang explained that he had done so to emphasize his importance.

Zhang Shi Zhi served Emperor Jing for more than a year and later became the prime minister of Huainan. Despite his past mistakes, he never held another official position in his life.

Feng Tang’s father was from Zhao, and his family was relocated to Dai during the Han dynasty’s rise. Feng Tang himself was known for his filial piety and served Emperor Xiaowen. When the emperor passed by, he mentioned his father’s service as a general and praised his father’s knowledge of the generals Li Qi and others. The emperor was impressed and appointed Feng Tang as the head of the imperial guards.

Later, someone stole an object from the ancestral temple, and Zhang Shi Zhi recommended a moderate punishment. However, the emperor disagreed, saying that the law should not be applied so leniently. After some discussion, the emperor finally agreed with Zhang Shi Zhi’s judgment.

In summary, Zhang Shi Zhi and Feng Tang were both respected figures in the court for their wisdom and integrity. Their words and actions set a good example for others. As the saying goes, “To judge a person, one should look at their friends.” The principles they upheld are worth remembering and emulating. [end of text]
