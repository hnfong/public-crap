### (1) Translation of the Story

**魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。**

Wei Wu Hou (the Marquis of Wei) made a decision that was correct, and none of his ministers could match his wisdom. After the court session, he had a look of joy on his face.

**吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」**

Wu Qi (a military strategist) approached and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhao of Chu?"

**武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」**

Wei Wu Hou asked, "What did King Zhao of Chu say?"

**吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」**

Wu Qi replied, "King Zhao of Chu made a decision that was correct, and none of his ministers could match his wisdom. After the court session, he had a look of worry on his face. Shen Gong Wu Shen approached and asked, 'Your Majesty, why do you have a worried look after the court session?' King Zhao replied, 'I made a decision that was correct, and none of my ministers could match my wisdom. This worries me. There is a saying in the 'Zhong Wu' (a classical text): "Rulers who find a teacher become kings, those who find friends become hegemons, those who find doubts survive, and those who rely solely on their own wisdom perish." Now, with my lack of virtue, and none of my ministers able to match my wisdom, our country is close to perishing! This is why I am worried.' King Zhao of Chu was worried, but you are joyful."

**武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」**

Wei Wu Hou hesitated, then bowed twice and said, "Heaven has sent you, Master, to correct my mistakes."

### (2) Moral of the Story

The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should be humble and concerned when his decisions are correct and none of his ministers can match his wisdom. This is because it indicates a lack of capable advisors, which could lead to the downfall of the state. The story emphasizes the importance of having wise and capable advisors and the dangers of relying solely on one's own judgment.

### (3) Counterpart in Western (European) Thought

The concepts in this story have counterparts in Western thought, particularly in the ideas of classical philosophers and political theorists.

- **Plato's "The Republic"**: Plato discusses the importance of having a wise and just ruler who is surrounded by knowledgeable advisors. He argues that a ruler who relies solely on his own wisdom without the input of others is prone to making mistakes.

- **Aristotle's "Politics"**: Aristotle emphasizes the importance of having a balanced and virtuous ruler who listens to the advice of his counselors. He believes that a good ruler should be humble and open to the wisdom of others.

- **Machiavelli's "The Prince"**: Machiavelli discusses the importance of having wise advisors and the dangers of relying solely on one's own judgment. He argues that a prince should be open to the advice of his counselors and should not be overly confident in his own abilities.

These Western thinkers, like the story from 荀子, highlight the importance of humility, the value of wise counsel, and the dangers of over-reliance on one's own judgment in leadership. [end of text]
