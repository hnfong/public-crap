This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

### (1) Translation of the Story

**魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。**

Wei Wu Hou (the Marquis of Wei) made a decision that was correct, and none of his ministers could match his wisdom. After the court session, he had a look of joy on his face.

**吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」**

Wu Qi (a military strategist) stepped forward and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhao of Chu?"

**武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」**

Wei Wu Hou asked, "What did King Zhao of Chu say?"

**吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」**

Wu Qi replied, "King Zhao of Chu made a decision that was correct, and none of his ministers could match his wisdom. After the court session, he had a look of worry on his face. Shen Gong Wu Shen stepped forward and asked, 'Your Majesty, why do you have a worried look after the court session?' King Zhao replied, 'I made a decision that was correct, and none of my ministers could match my wisdom. This worries me. As the saying goes, 'A ruler who finds a teacher becomes a king, one who finds a friend becomes a hegemon, one who finds doubt survives, and one who thinks he is the wisest will perish.' Now, with my lack of virtue, and none of my ministers can match my wisdom, is my country close to perishing? This is why I am worried.' King Zhao of Chu was worried, but you are joyful."

**武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」**

Wei Wu Hou hesitated, then bowed twice and said, "Heaven has sent you, Master, to correct my mistakes."

### (2) Moral of the Story

The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should be humble and concerned about the lack of capable advisors. King Zhao of Chu's worry stems from the realization that his ministers are not able to match his wisdom, which he sees as a potential weakness for his kingdom. In contrast, Wei Wu Hou's joy at his own superiority over his ministers is seen as a flaw. The story emphasizes the importance of having wise and capable advisors and the dangers of overconfidence in one's own abilities.

### (3) Counterpart in Western (European) Thought

The concepts in this story have counterparts in Western thought, particularly in the realm of political philosophy and leadership ethics. For example:

- **Plato's "The Republic"**: Plato discusses the importance of having a philosopher-king who is wise and just. However, he also emphasizes the need for a well-structured society where different classes (philosophers, warriors, and producers) work together harmoniously. The idea that a ruler should be concerned about the wisdom of his advisors is reflected in the need for a balanced and just society.

- **Machiavelli's "The Prince"**: Niccolò Machiavelli discusses the qualities of a successful ruler, including the importance of being both feared and loved. While Machiavelli's focus is more on practical politics and the use of power, the idea of a ruler being aware of his limitations and the need for capable advisors is implicit in his advice.

- **Aristotle's "Politics"**: Aristotle discusses the importance of virtue in leadership and the need for a ruler to be just and wise. He also emphasizes the importance of having a well-structured government where different roles are filled by those who are best suited for them, reflecting the idea that a ruler should be concerned about the capabilities of his advisors.

In summary, the story from 荀子 aligns with Western philosophical ideas about the importance of wisdom, humility, and the need for capable advisors in effective leadership. [end of text]
