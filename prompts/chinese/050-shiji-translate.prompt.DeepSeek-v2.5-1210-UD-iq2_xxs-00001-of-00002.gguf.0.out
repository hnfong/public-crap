"Chronicles of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang"
Zhang Tingwei Shizhi, a native of Duyang, was styled Ji. He had an elder brother, Zhong, with whom he lived together. He became a Qilang (a minor official) through wealth and served Emperor Xiaowen. After ten years, he had not been promoted and was not well-known. Shizhi said, "Prolonged service diminishes Zhong's property, and it does not succeed." He wanted to resign and return home. Zhonglang Jiang Yuan Ang knew his worth and regretted his departure, so he requested to transfer Shizhi to the position of Yezhe. After Shizhi finished his court duties, he approached the emperor to speak about matters of convenience. Emperor Wen said, "Speak humbly, without lofty discourse, so that it can be implemented now." Thus, Shizhi spoke about the events between Qin and Han, and the reasons for Qin's decline and Han's rise for a long time. Emperor Wen praised him and appointed Shizhi as the Yezhe Puyi.
Shizhi accompanied the emperor on a tour and ascended the Tiger Pen. The emperor asked the Shanglin Attendant about the records of various birds and beasts, asking more than ten questions, but the attendant could not answer and looked around. The Tiger Pen Se夫 stepped in from the side and answered the emperor's questions about the records of birds and beasts very thoroughly, intending to demonstrate his ability to respond swiftly and endlessly. Emperor Wen said, "Shouldn't officials be like this? The attendant is unreliable!" He then ordered Shizhi to appoint the Se夫 as the Shanglin令. Shizhi hesitated for a long time before saying, "Your Majesty, what kind of person do you consider Jinghou Zhou Bo to be?" The emperor replied, "A virtuous man." Shizhi then asked, "What about Dongyanghou Zhang Xiangru?" The emperor again said, "A virtuous man." Shizhi responded, "Jinghou and Dongyanghou are considered virtuous men, yet these two men could not speak of matters easily. How could they be like this Se夫, who is glib and quick-tongued! Moreover, Qin relied on scribes, and officials competed to be swift and strict, but their flaws were merely superficial, lacking genuine compassion. As a result, their faults were not known, and the decline reached the Second Generation, leading to the collapse of the empire. Now, Your Majesty promotes the Se夫 for his glib speech, and I fear that the world will follow this trend, competing in glibness without substance. Moreover, the influence of the lower on the upper is swift, and one must be cautious in actions and decisions." Emperor Wen said, "Well said." He then stopped the appointment of the Se夫.
The emperor boarded his chariot and summoned Shizhi to accompany him. As they slowly proceeded, the emperor asked Shizhi about the flaws of Qin. Shizhi spoke frankly. Upon reaching the palace, the emperor appointed Shizhi as the Gongche令.
Shortly after, the Crown Prince and Liang Wang entered the court together in a chariot but did not dismount at the Sima Gate. Shizhi stopped the Crown Prince and Liang Wang from entering the palace gate. He then impeached them for not respecting the public gate and submitted the report. When Empress Dowager Bo heard of this, Emperor Wen removed his hat and apologized, saying, "I have not taught my son properly." Empress Dowager Bo then sent an envoy with a decree to pardon the Crown Prince and Liang Wang, allowing them to enter. Emperor Wen thus esteemed Shizhi and appointed him as Zhongdafu.
Shortly after, Shizhi was promoted to Zhonglang Jiang. He accompanied the emperor to Baling and stayed north, overlooking the toilet. At that time, Lady Shen was present, and the emperor pointed to the Xinfeng Road for Lady Shen, saying, "This is the road to Handan." He had Lady Shen play the zither, and the emperor sang along, feeling melancholy and sorrowful. He turned to the ministers and said, "Alas! Using the stone of Beishan as a coffin, filling it with shredded ramie and applying lacquer, how can it be moved!" The attendants all said, "Excellent." Shizhi stepped forward and said, "If there is something desirable inside, even sealing Mount Nan shan would not prevent a gap; if there is nothing desirable inside, even without a stone coffin, what sorrow would there be!" Emperor Wen praised him. Subsequently, Shizhi was appointed as Tingwei.
Shortly after, the emperor was traveling on the Zhongwei Bridge when a man emerged from under the bridge, startling the emperor's horse. The emperor ordered the cavalry to capture the man and handed him over to Tingwei. Shizhi interrogated the man, who said, "I am a native of the county, and I heard the emperor's procession, so I hid under the bridge. After a long time, I thought the procession had passed, so I came out and saw the emperor's chariot and cavalry, and I ran away." Tingwei Qin judged that the man, having violated the emperor's procession, should be fined gold. Emperor Wen was furious, saying, "This man startled my horse, and my horse is fortunately gentle. If it were another horse, wouldn't I be injured? Yet Tingwei only fines him with gold!" Shizhi said, "The law is shared by the emperor and the people. If the law is as it is and is changed to be harsher, the law will lose credibility among the people. Moreover, at that time, if the emperor had ordered his execution, it would have been done. Now that it has been handed to Tingwei, Tingwei is the arbiter of the empire. If it tilts, the application of the law across the empire will be inconsistent, and the people will not know where to place their hands and feet. I beg Your Majesty to consider this." After a long time, the emperor said, "Tingwei's judgment is correct."
Subsequently, someone stole the jade ring from the seat of the high temple, and the thief was captured. Emperor Wen was furious and ordered Tingwei to handle the case. Shizhi investigated the law and submitted a report stating that the thief should be executed in public. The emperor was greatly angered, saying, "This man is without virtue, stealing the vessel of the former emperor. I entrusted this to Tingwei, intending to have him executed, yet you submitted the law, which is not in line with my intention to uphold the temple." Shizhi removed his hat and bowed, apologizing, "The law is sufficient as it is. Moreover, the punishment is equal, but it varies with the circumstances. Now, if stealing a temple vessel results in execution, what would happen if, by a fraction of a percent, a foolish person took a handful of soil from Changling? How would Your Majesty apply the law then?" After a long time, Emperor Wen discussed this with Empress Dowager, and they agreed to Tingwei's judgment. At that time, Zhongwei Zhou Yafu and Liang Xiang Shandu Hou Wang Tiankai saw that Shizhi upheld justice, and they became close friends. Tingwei Zhang thus gained recognition across the empire.
After Emperor Wen's death and Emperor Jing's ascension, Shizhi was fearful and claimed illness, wanting to resign. He feared severe punishment if he left; if he sought an audience to apologize, he did not know how it would go. Following Wang Sheng's advice, he eventually sought an audience to apologize, and Emperor Jing did not reprimand him.
Wang Sheng was skilled in the teachings of Huang Lao and was a recluse. He was once summoned to the court, where the three dukes and nine ministers all stood. Wang Sheng, an old man, said, "My socks are loose," and turned to Tingwei Zhang, saying, "Tie my socks for me!" Shizhi knelt and tied them. Afterward, someone asked Wang Sheng, "Why did you humiliate Tingwei Zhang by making him kneel to tie your socks?" Wang Sheng replied, "I am old and lowly, and I know I cannot benefit Tingwei Zhang. Tingwei Zhang is a renowned minister of the empire today. I intentionally humiliated him by making him kneel to tie my socks, to enhance his reputation." The officials heard this and esteemed Wang Sheng and respected Tingwei Zhang.
Tingwei Zhang served Emperor Jing for over a year and was appointed as the prime minister of Huainan, still bearing the previous offense. After some time, Shizhi passed away. His son, Zhang Zhi, styled Changgong, reached the position of Daifu but was dismissed. Unable to accommodate himself to the current era, he never held office again.
Feng Tang's grandfather was from Zhao, and his father moved to Dai. When Han rose, they moved to Anling. Tang was known for his filial piety and served as Zhonglang Shuzhang under Emperor Wen. Emperor Wen, passing by in a carriage, asked Tang, "Why are you, an old man, serving as a郎? Where is your home?" Tang如实 answered. Emperor Wen said, "When I was in Dai, my food supervisor Gao Qu repeatedly told me about the virtue of Zhao's general Li Qi, who fought at the foot of Julu. Now, every time I eat, my thoughts are never far from Julu. Do you know him?" Tang replied, "He is not as good as Lian Po and Li Mu as generals." The emperor asked, "Why?" Tang said, "My grandfather was in Zhao and served as an officer, befriending Li Mu. My father was the prime minister of Dai and befriended Zhao's general Li Qi, knowing his character." After hearing about Lian Po and Li Mu's characters, the emperor was pleased and slapped his thigh, saying, "Alas! If only Lian Po and Li Mu were alive to be my generals, I would not worry about the Xiongnu!" Tang said, "Your Majesty, even if you had Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them." The emperor was angry and left for the inner palace. After a long time, he summoned Tang and reproached him, "Why did you humiliate me in front of everyone, without finding a private place?" Tang apologized, "I am a rustic and do not know the rules."
At that time, the Xiongnu had recently invaded Chaona and killed the commander of Beidi. The emperor was concerned about the Hu threat and finally asked Tang, "Why do you know I cannot use Lian Po and Li Mu?" Tang replied, "I have heard that ancient kings, when dispatching generals, would kneel and push the chariot, saying that within the gate, the king governs, and beyond the gate, the general governs. Military merits and爵赏 are decided outside, and only then are they reported. This is not false. My grandfather said that when Li Mu was Zhao's general stationed at the border, the taxes from the military market were used to entertain the soldiers, and rewards were decided outside, without interference from the center. Trust was given, and success was demanded, so Li Mu could fully utilize his intelligence. He sent 1,300 armored chariots, 13,000 archers, and 100,000 soldiers with gold, thus driving the Xiongnu north, breaking the Donghu, annihilating the Danlin, suppressing the strong Qin in the west, and supporting Han and Wei in the south. At that time, Zhao was nearly霸. Later, when Zhao Wang Qian ascended the throne, his mother was a singer. Wang Qian, influenced by Guo Kai's slander, eventually executed Li Mu and appointed Yan Ju to replace him. Thus, the army was defeated, the soldiers fled, and Zhao was captured and annihilated by Qin. Now, I have heard that Wei Shang is the governor of Yunzhong, and all the taxes from the military market are used to entertain the soldiers, and he uses his private funds, slaughtering a cow every five days to entertain the guests, military officers, and舍人, so the Xiongnu stay far away, not approaching the Yunzhong pass. Once, the enemy invaded, and Shang led the chariots and cavalry to attack, killing many. The soldiers are all common sons, recruited from the fields to serve in the army, and how would they know the military records and formations? They fight all day, cutting off heads and capturing enemies, reporting their merits to the headquarters, yet if one word does not match, the scribes use the law to restrain them. Their rewards are not given, and the officials strictly enforce the law. I am foolish and believe that Your Majesty's law is too strict, the rewards too light, and the punishments too heavy. Moreover, Wei Shang of Yunzhong is charged with a discrepancy of six levels in reporting the number of heads and enemies, and Your Majesty has handed him to the officials, stripping his爵 and punishing him. From this, it is clear that even if Your Majesty had Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them. I am truly foolish and have offended the禁忌, guilty of death!" Emperor Wen was pleased. That day, he ordered Feng Tang to carry the节 to pardon Wei Shang and reinstate him as the governor of Yunzhong, and appointed Tang as the Cavalry Commander, overseeing the Cavalry and the chariot soldiers of the prefectures and kingdoms.
In the seventh year, Emperor Jing ascended the throne and appointed Tang as the prime minister of Chu, but he was dismissed. When Emperor Wu ascended, he sought virtuous and talented individuals and nominated Feng Tang. Tang was over ninety years old and could no longer serve as an official, so his son, Feng Sui, styled Wangsun, was appointed as a郎. Sui was also an extraordinary individual and was friendly with me.
The Grand Historian said: Zhang Ji's words reflect the virtue of a gentleman, adhering to the law without bending to personal wishes; Feng Gong's discussion of generals is meaningful! Meaningful! As the saying goes, "If you do not know a person, look at his friends." The praises of these two men can be inscribed in the halls of power. The Book says, "Without partiality or partisanship, the king's way is broad; without partisanship or partiality, the king's way is smooth." Zhang Ji and Feng Gong come close to this. [end of text]
