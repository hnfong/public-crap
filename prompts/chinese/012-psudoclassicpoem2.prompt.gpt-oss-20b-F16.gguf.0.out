<|channel|>analysis<|message|>The user writes a modern poem that mimics classical Chinese poetry: "多情自古空餘恨，此恨綿綿無絕期". They ask to explain its source, then create similar sentences. They want to see a classical vibe, preferably by extracting two real classical lines and pairing them to create new lines. So we need to explain the source: The lines are not from a single classical poem; they are a modern creation. But maybe the first line "多情自古空餘恨" is reminiscent of "多情自古空餘恨" from "長恨歌"? Actually "多情自古空餘恨" is not a known line. But "多情自古空餘恨" might be a paraphrase of "多情自古空餘恨，無情自古不相識" or something. Let's search memory: There's a line "多情自古空餘恨，無情自古不相識" from "長恨歌"? Wait, "長恨歌" by 白居易: "漢皇重色思傾國，御宇多年求不得" etc. Not that. There's a line "多情自古空餘恨，無情自古不相識" from "長恨歌"? Actually "長恨歌" has "多情自古空餘恨" maybe? Let's recall: "長恨歌" includes "多情自古空餘恨，無情自古不相識" maybe from "長恨歌"?
