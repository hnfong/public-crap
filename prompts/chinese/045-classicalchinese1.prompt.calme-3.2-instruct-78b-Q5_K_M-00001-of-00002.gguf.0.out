Q1: In the ancient city of Handan, a local official, Ximen Bao, uncovered a corrupt practice where the local elders and a witch colluded to extort money from the people by claiming they were sacrificing young women to a river god, causing the city to become impoverished and depopulated. Ximen Bao used his wit to expose and end this practice, saving the people from further exploitation.

Q2: Young and beautiful women from poor families were the victims.

Q3. The local elders, the witch, and the officials who shared the extorted money were the beneficiaries.

Q4: Ximen Bao used his wit. He pretended to participate in the ritual, but instead, he had the witch, her assistants, and the elders thrown into the river, exposing their fraud and ending the practice without causing a public uprising.

Q5: From a utilitarian perspective, Ximen Bao's actions were moral as they saved many from future exploitation and potential death. From a deontological perspective, his actions could be seen as immoral as he used deceit and potentially took lives. From a virtue ethics perspective, his actions were moral as he displayed courage and wisdom in his actions.

Q6: The quote compares three officials: Zi Chan, Zi Jian, and Ximen Bao, in their methods of governance. Zi Chan governed in a way that made people unable to deceive him, Zi Jian governed in a way that made people unwilling to deceive him, and Ximen Bao governed in a way that made people dare not deceive him. The comment is fair as it accurately reflects their different styles, but it doesn't necessarily indicate which is the most virtuous or effective. It leaves the judgment to the reader, suggesting that different methods can be effective in different contexts. [end of text]
