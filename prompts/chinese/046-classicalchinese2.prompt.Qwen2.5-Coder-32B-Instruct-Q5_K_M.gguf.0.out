### (1) Translation of the Story into English

Duke Ling of Wei was planning matters and was right in his decisions, surpassing all his ministers. After the court session, he had a pleased expression. Wu Qi approached and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu from those around you?" Duke Ling said, "What were King Zhuang of Chu's words like?" Wu Qi replied, "King Zhuang of Chu was planning matters and was right in his decisions, surpassing all his ministers. After the court session, he had a worried expression. Shen Gong Wucheng approached and asked, 'Your Majesty, why do you have a worried expression after the court session?' King Zhuang said, 'I am worried because I am right in my decisions and surpass all my ministers. In the words of the sage Zhongmou, it is said: "Those who can rely on their own teachers will become kings, those who can rely on their own friends will become hegemonic lords, those who can rely on their own doubts will survive, and those who rely on their own plans and have no one better than themselves will perish." Now, with my own inadequacy, and my ministers unable to surpass me, our state is almost on the brink of destruction! That is why I am worried.' King Zhuang was worried, while Your Majesty is pleased." Duke Ling bowed twice and said, "Heaven has sent you, Sir, to correct my mistakes."

### (2) Explanation of the Moral of the Story

The moral of the story is the importance of humility and self-reflection. Even when one is successful and making correct decisions, it is crucial to remain cautious and aware of potential dangers. The story illustrates that being overly pleased with one's own abilities can lead to complacency and ultimately to failure. King Zhuang of Chu's wisdom lies in his ability to recognize that his success could be a sign of his isolation from better ideas and perspectives, which could be detrimental to the state. Duke Ling of Wei learns this lesson and acknowledges his mistake.

### (3) Counterpart in Western (European) Thought

The concept of humility and the dangers of complacency in Western thought can be found in various philosophical and religious traditions. One notable example is from the Bible, particularly in the New Testament, where Jesus Christ teaches about the importance of humility and warns against pride. The parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector (Luke 18:9-14) illustrates the dangers of self-righteousness and the benefits of humility.

Another example is from the works of ancient Greek philosophers. Plato, in his dialogues, often emphasizes the importance of self-knowledge and the recognition of one's own limitations. Socrates, in particular, is known for his famous dictum "I know that I know nothing," which underscores the value of humility and the pursuit of wisdom.

In modern Western philosophy, the concept of humility is also discussed in the context of epistemology and moral philosophy. Philosophers like Ren√© Descartes and Immanuel Kant have explored the limits of human knowledge and the importance of recognizing these limits in ethical decision-making.

Thus, the moral of the story from the passage in the Analects of Confucius has counterparts in Western thought, particularly in the emphasis on humility, self-reflection, and the recognition of one's own limitations. [end of text]
