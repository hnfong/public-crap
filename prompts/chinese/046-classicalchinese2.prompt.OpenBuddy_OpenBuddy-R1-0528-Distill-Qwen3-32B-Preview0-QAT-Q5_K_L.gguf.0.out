(1) Translation:

Wei Wu Hou was successful in his decision-making, and none of his ministers could match him. After leaving the court, he had a joyful expression. Wu Qi approached and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Chu Zhuang Wang from those around you?" Wu Hou asked, "What did King Chu Zhuang Wang say?" Wu Qi replied, "When King Chu Zhuang Wang was successful in his decision-making, and none of his ministers could match him, he left the court with a worried expression. Shen Gong Wu Chen approached and asked, 'Why do you have a worried expression after the court session?' King Chu Zhuang Wang said, 'I am worried because I am successful in my decision-making, and none of my ministers can match me. As the saying goes, 'A king who has a wise teacher will become a king, a king who has a wise friend will become a hegemon, a king who has a wise advisor will survive, but a king who makes decisions without anyone to match him will perish.' Now, with my lack of virtue and none of my ministers being able to match me, my country is on the verge of destruction. That's why I am worried.' King Chu Zhuang Wang was worried, but you are joyful." Wu Hou hesitated and then bowed twice, saying, "May the heavens send you to correct my mistake."

(2) The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should be humble and always seek advice from others, even when they are successful in their decision-making. A ruler who is too confident in their own abilities and does not listen to the opinions of others may lead their country to destruction. The story also emphasizes the importance of having wise advisors and friends who can provide guidance and support.

(3) The concept of seeking advice and guidance from others is present in Western (European) thought as well. For example, in ancient Greece, the philosopher Socrates believed in the importance of questioning and seeking knowledge from others. In medieval Europe, the concept of the "wise counsel" was important in the governance of kingdoms and empires. The idea that a ruler should be humble and seek advice from others is also present in the teachings of many religious and philosophical traditions, such as Christianity and Buddhism. [end of text]
