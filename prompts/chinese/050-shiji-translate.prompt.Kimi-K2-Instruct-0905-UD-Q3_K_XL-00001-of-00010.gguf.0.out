“Biographies of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang”

Zhang Shizhi, styled Ji, was a native of Duyang. He had an elder brother named Zhong, and they lived together. By purchasing office he became a mounted gentleman-attendant, serving Emperor Wen of Han; for ten years he received no promotion and was unknown. Shizhi said, “Long service has whittled away Zhong’s property without success.” He wished to resign and return home. General of the Palace Guards Yuan Ang, knowing his worth, regretted his departure and petitioned to transfer Shizhi to fill a post as usher. After Shizhi had finished court audience, he stepped forward to speak on matters of immediate advantage. The Emperor said, “Keep it low; do not loftily discourse—let it be something that can be put into practice today.” Thereupon Shizhi spoke at length on events between Qin and Han, why Qin failed and Han rose. The Emperor praised him and appointed him Usher-Prefect.

When Shizhi accompanied the Emperor on a visit to the tiger enclosure, the sovereign questioned the Shang-lin commandant about the registers of birds and beasts. After more than ten questions the commandant looked left and right, quite unable to answer. A steward of the tiger pen standing nearby answered every question in full detail, wishing thereby to display his ability to respond without end. The Emperor said, “Should officials not be like this? The commandant is worthless!” and ordered Shizhi to promote the steward to be superintendent of Shang-lin. Shizhi stepped forward and said, “Your Majesty, what sort of man do you consider the Marquis of Jiang, Zhou Bo?” The Emperor replied, “A venerable elder.” Again he asked, “And what of the Marquis of Dongyang, Zhang Xiangru?” The Emperor again said, “A venerable elder.” Shizhi said, “These two, called elders, could scarcely utter a word when discussing affairs. Are they to be outdone by this garrulous, sharp-tongued steward? Moreover, Qin employed knife-and-brush clerks who vied in quick severity and harsh scrutiny, but the harm was mere show of documents, devoid of humane substance. Thus its faults went unheeded, decline reached the Second Generation, and the empire crumbled. Now, if Your Majesty promotes this steward for his glib tongue, I fear the realm will follow the fashion, striving for mere eloquence without substance. Further, the lower imitate the upper faster than shadow or echo; promotions and dismissals must be weighed carefully.” The Emperor said, “Good,” and desisted.

The Emperor entered his carriage, summoned Shizhi to ride beside him, and while moving slowly asked him Qin’s faults. Shizhi answered with plain truth. On reaching the palace the Emperor appointed him Chief of the Imperial Carriages.

Soon afterward the heir-apparent and the Prince of Liang rode together into court and failed to dismount at the Sima Gate. Shizhi pursued and stopped them, refusing them entry to the palace gate. He then impeached them for disrespect in not descending at the public gate and submitted the indictment. When Empress Dowager Bo heard of it, Emperor Wen bared his head and apologized, saying, “I failed to teach my sons properly.” The Empress Dowager sent an envoy with an edict pardoning the two, who were then allowed to enter. From this the Emperor esteemed Shizhi and appointed him Palace Grandee.

Shortly thereafter he rose to General of the Palace Guards. On a progress to Ba-ling they halted north of the privy. At that time Lady Shen accompanied them; the Emperor pointed to the Xinfeng road and told her, “This is the road to Handan.” He had her strum the se, leaned on it and sang, his mood mournful and full of longing, then turned to the assembled officials and sighed, “Ah! If my coffin were carved from northern mountain stone, packed with ramie and lacquer in the joints, who could disturb it?” All around said, “Excellent.” Shizhi advanced and said, “If within it there be something desirable, even chaining together South Mountain would leave a crack; if nothing desirable, even without stone coffin, what grief could there be?” The Emperor praised him. Later he appointed Shizhi Commandant of Justice.

Not long after, the Emperor was crossing Zhong-wei Bridge when a man ran out from beneath it and startled the imperial horses. Cavalry seized him and turned him over to the Commandant of Justice. Shizhi examined him: “A county man, hearing the imperial progress, hid under the bridge. After a long while he thought it had passed, came out, saw the equipage, and fled.” The statute provided that one who breaches the imperial passage be fined. The Emperor, angry, said, “This fellow personally frightened my horse; by luck it is gentle—had it been another, would I not have been hurt? Yet you merely fine him!” Shizhi replied, “The law is what the Son of Heaven shares equally with all under Heaven. Now the law says this; to increase the penalty would make the law untrusted by the people. At the moment Your Majesty could have ordered him killed on the spot; once you handed him to the Commandant of Justice, who is the balance of the realm, one tilt and every application of law throughout the land will be too light or heavy—where then would the people place hand or foot? May Your Majesty consider.” After a long silence the Emperor said, “The Commandant’s judgment is correct.”

Later someone stole the jade ring from before the seat in the Ancestral Temple of Gao. Captured, he enraged the Emperor, who sent the case to the Commandant of Justice. Shizhi, finding the statute that theft of ancestral temple regalia merits public execution, reported the sentence. The Emperor, furious, said, “The man is utterly vile—he robbed the vessel of the former emperor! I gave him to you hoping you would exterminate his clan, yet you merely apply the statute—this is not how I wish to honor the temple!” Shizhi bared his head, knocked his forehead to the ground and said, “The law is sufficient as it stands. Equal guilt is graded by degree of malice. Now for stealing a temple vessel you would exterminate a clan; if, perchance, some foolish commoner took a handful of earth from Chang-ling, how would you increase the penalty?” Eventually the Emperor, after speaking with the Empress Dowager, approved the sentence. At that time the Marquis of Tiao, Zhou Yafu, and the Chancellor of Liang, the Marquis of Shandu, Wang Tiankai, seeing Shizhi’s impartiality, became his close friends, and the Commandant of Justice was praised throughout the realm.

After Emperor Wen died and Emperor Jing succeeded, Shizhi grew afraid and pleaded illness. Wishing to resign, he feared severe punishment; wishing to apologize, he did not know how. Following the plan of Wang Sheng, he finally appeared and apologized; Emperor Jing did not reproach him.

Wang Sheng, a recluse skilled in Huang-Lao doctrines, once attended court; the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers all stood. The old man said, “My stocking is untied,” turned to the Commandant of Justice and said, “Tie it for me!” Shizhi knelt and tied it. Afterwards someone asked Wang Sheng, “Why publicly humiliate the Commandant, making him kneel to tie your stocking?” Wang replied, “I am old and lowly; I can never benefit him. He is now a famed minister; I humiliated him purposely to enhance his repute.” When the nobles heard this, they esteemed both Wang Sheng and the Commandant of Justice.

Shizhi served Emperor Jing for over a year, then was made Chancellor to the King of Huai-nan, still because of the earlier incident. Long after, he died. His son Zhang Zhi, styled Changgong, reached the rank of grandee but was dismissed; unwilling to ingratiate himself with the age, he never again held office.

Feng Tang’s grandfather was a man of Zhao; his father moved to Dai, and when Han arose they settled at Anling. Noted for filial piety, Feng Tang became head of the palace guards’ office, serving Emperor Wen. Once when the Emperor’s carriage passed he asked Feng Tang, “Old man, whence come you to be a gentleman-attendant? Where is your home?” Feng Tang answered frankly. The Emperor said, “When I lived in Dai, my steward of victuals, Gao Qu, often praised the Zhao general Li Qi who fought below Julu. Even now, whenever I eat, my thoughts return to Julu. Do you know of him?” Feng Tang replied, “He still falls short of Lian Po or Li Mu.” The Emperor asked why. Feng Tang said, “My grandfather, while in Zhao, served as a troop commander and was friendly with Li Mu; my father, once Chancellor of Dai, knew the Zhao general Li Qi well.” Having heard of Lian Po and Li Mu, the Emperor clapped his thigh and sighed, “Alas! If only I had Lian Po or Li Mu as generals, would I worry about the Xiongnu!” Feng Tang said, “Pardon me, Your Majesty: even if you had them, you could not employ them.” Angered, the Emperor rose and withdrew. Later he summoned Feng Tang and reproached him, “Why did you publicly shame me?” Feng Tang apologized, “A rustic, I know no taboos.”

At that time the Xiongnu had just raided Cha-na and killed the commandant of Beidi. Concerned, the Emperor again asked Feng Tang, “How do you know I could not use Lian Po or Li Mu?” Feng Tang replied, “I hear that ancient kings, when sending forth generals, knelt to push the chariot wheel and said, ‘Within the gate I rule; beyond the gate the general rules.’ Rewards of rank and booty were decided abroad and reported afterward. My grandfather said that when Li Mu guarded Zhao’s frontier, the market taxes of the army were spent at his discretion to feast the troops; rewards were decided outside, unhindered from within. Entrusted with full power and held to results, Li mustered thirteen hundred chosen war-carts, thirteen thousand mounted archers, and a hundred thousand worthies, drove the Chanyu north, shattered the Donghu, wiped out Danlin, checked Qin in the west and supported Han and Wei in the south—Zhao nearly became hegemon. Later King Qian of Zhao, whose mother was a courtesan, believed the slander of Guo Kai and executed Li Mu, replacing him with Yan Ju; thus the army was routed and Zhao destroyed by Qin. I have heard that Wei Shang, commandant of Yunzhong, spends all army-market taxes on his soldiers, adds his own funds, slaughters an ox every five days to feast guests, officers, and retainers, so the Xiongnu keep far from Yunzhong. Once when they raided, Shang led chariots and horse in attack, killing many. Yet these soldiers are common sons of households who left their ploughs for war; they know nothing of ledgers or tallies. They fight all day, behead and capture, but when the record submitted to headquarters contains one discrepancy, clerks apply the law and withhold reward while enforcing every penalty. I foolishly think Your Majesty’s laws are too precise, rewards too scanty, punishments too heavy. For a shortfall of six heads in the count of enemy slain, you had the commandant arrested, his rank stripped, and him sentenced to labor. Thus, even with Lian Po or Li Mu, Your Majesty could not use them. I speak bluntly at risk of death.” Pleased, the Emperor that very day sent Feng Tang with credentials to pardon Wei Shang and restore him as commandant of Yunzhong, and appointed Feng Tang General of Chariots and Cavalry in charge of the capital and provincial cavalry.

Seven years later Emperor Jing succeeded and made Feng Tang Chancellor of Chu; he was later dismissed. When Emperor Wu ascended he sought worthies; Feng Tang, over ninety, could no longer serve, so his son Feng Sui was made a gentleman-attendant. Feng Sui, styled Wangsun, is also an extraordinary man and my friend.

The Grand Historian remarks: Zhang Ji’s discourse on elders upheld the law without bending to favor; Feng Gong’s discourse on command has flavor indeed! The proverb says, “Know a man by his friends.” What these two praised can be displayed in the halls of state. The Documents say, “Without partiality the royal way is broad; without bias the royal way is smooth.” Zhang Ji and Feng Gong approached this. [end of text]
