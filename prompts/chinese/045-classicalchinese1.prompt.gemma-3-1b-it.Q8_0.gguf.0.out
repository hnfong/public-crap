Okay, here are the answers to your questions, following your guidelines:

**Q1: Give a short summary of the story (5 points)**

The story depicts the controversial practice of offering young women to the river god, reflecting the societal pressures and power dynamics of the time.  The old practice, involving the offering of girls to the river, was seen as a way to appease the god and secure a favorable marriage for the women.  However, it ultimately led to widespread suffering and despair, as the practice was seen as a cruel and unsustainable solution.

**Q2: What kind of women were usually the victims in the story (2 points)**

Young women, particularly those considered vulnerable or unmarried, were the primary victims of the practice.  They were often seen as objects of desire and were targeted by the powerful elite.

**Q3: Who were deemed to benefit from the old practice of offering girls? (2 points)**

The elite, particularly the powerful officials and wealthy landowners, were deemed to benefit. They saw the practice as a way to secure advantageous marriages for their daughters and maintain their social standing.

**Q4: Did the protagonist use wits or force to deal with the situation? Explain (5 points)**

The protagonist used a combination of wits and strategic maneuvering. He initially employed subtle tactics – observing the women's behavior, subtly manipulating the situation, and using his authority to create a sense of unease and fear. He didn't rely on brute force, but rather on carefully calculated actions to disrupt the practice and expose its cruelty.

**Q5: Was it moral for the protagonist to do so? Briefly provide views from various perspectives (10 points)**

This is a complex question with no easy answer. Here’s a breakdown of different perspectives:

*   **The protagonist's perspective:** He was motivated by a desire to alleviate suffering and protect the people from a cruel and unjust practice. He believed it was a necessary act of compassion.
*   **The officials' perspective:** They viewed the practice as a legitimate means of securing advantageous marriages and maintaining their power. They saw it as a pragmatic solution to a societal problem.
*   **The villagers' perspective:** They were deeply affected by the suffering and despair caused by the practice. They saw it as a violation of women's dignity and a symbol of oppression.
*   **A more nuanced view:**  The story suggests a moral gray area. While the protagonist acted with good intentions, his methods were arguably harsh and ultimately contributed to the misery of the people. It raises questions about the ethics of using manipulation and coercion to address social problems.

**Q6: At the end of 滑稽列传, it is said that: "傳曰：「子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。」三子之才能誰最賢哉？辨治者當能別之。" -- explain what it means, and whether the comment is fair.**

This quote is a powerful statement about the importance of leadership. It means that the most skilled and just ruler is one who doesn't exploit the weaknesses of others. The comment is fair in that it highlights the need for rulers to be aware of the societal pressures and vulnerabilities of the people they govern.  It suggests that a ruler who understands and addresses these issues is more likely to create a stable and just society.
