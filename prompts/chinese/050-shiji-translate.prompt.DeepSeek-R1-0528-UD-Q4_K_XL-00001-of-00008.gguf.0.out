Hmm, the user wants me to translate a classical Chinese historical text into English with very specific requirements. They insist on keeping all proper names in original Chinese characters and forbid any transliteration. They also want a literal translation without explanations.

This is from the Shiji (Records of the Grand Historian) - the biographies of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang. The text contains many historical figures, official titles, and classical idioms that need careful handling. 

The key challenges are:
- Maintaining all names like 張釋之, 文帝, 霸陵 in original Chinese as demanded
- Preserving the formal historical narrative style
- Translating legal and bureaucratic terms precisely (e.g. 廷尉 as Chamberlain for Law Enforcement)
- Handling classical idioms literally (e.g. "卑之毋甚高論")
- Keeping the dialog's rhetorical power (like Zhang's arguments about law)

I notice the user is very particular about consistency - they repeated the instruction twice. Probably a researcher or student working with primary sources. The "if in doubt, literal translation" suggests they prioritize accuracy over fluency.

For tricky terms:
- 騎郎 → Cavalry Gentleman (standard translation)
- 謁者仆射 → Chief of Receptionists
- 犯蹕 → violating the imperial guard's clearance
- 棄市 → execution in marketplace (standard penalty term)

The emotional moments need care too - like Emperor Wen's melancholy at Ba Ling, or Feng Tang's bold criticism. Should keep the original tone.

The ending with Sima Qian's commentary is crucial - must preserve the "太史公曰" format and the classical quotation style. 

Biggest risk is the legal arguments - like Zhang's defense of consistent sentencing. Need to ensure the logic comes through clearly in translation. The "一抔土" analogy about grave robbery laws is particularly important to get right.

Will proceed section by section, double-checking each official title against historical sources. The user clearly knows their Shiji, so no room for error.

**The Biographies of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang**  

Zhang Shizhi, Chamberlain for Law Enforcement, was a native of Duyang, styled Ji. He lived with his elder brother Zhong. Using family wealth, he became a Cavalry Gentleman serving Emperor Xiaowen. After ten years without promotion and remaining obscure, Zhang Shizhi said, "A long official career depletes Zhong’s resources without success." He wished to resign and return home. General of the Palace Guard Yuan Ang, recognizing his worth and regretting his departure, requested to transfer Zhang Shizhi to serve as a Receptionist. After the court session, Zhang Shizhi stepped forward to propose beneficial policies. Emperor Wen said, "Keep it humble. Do not speak too loftily; focus on what can be implemented now." Thereupon, Zhang Shizhi discussed the transition from Qin to Han—why Qin fell and Han rose—at length. Emperor Wen praised him and appointed him Chief of Receptionists.  

While accompanying the emperor to the tiger enclosure, Emperor Wen questioned the Director of Shanglin Park about the animal inventory. After over ten queries, the director glanced around, unable to answer. The keeper of the tiger enclosure answered thoroughly on his behalf, displaying effortless eloquence. Emperor Wen declared, "Should officials not be like this? The director is useless!" He ordered Zhang Shizhi to appoint the keeper as Director of Shanglin. Zhang Shizhi approached and said, "What does Your Majesty think of Zhou Bo, Marquis of Jiang?" The emperor replied, "A man of integrity." Zhang Shizhi asked again, "And Zhang Xiangru, Marquis of Dongyang?" The emperor answered, "Also a man of integrity." Zhang Shizhi said, "Though Zhou Bo and Zhang Xiangru were men of integrity, neither spoke fluently. Must we imitate this keeper’s glib tongue? Qin employed clerks obsessed with harsh scrutiny, leading to hollow governance devoid of compassion. Thus, faults went unchecked until the Second Emperor’s reign, when the empire collapsed. If Your Majesty promotes this keeper for his eloquence, I fear all will chase empty rhetoric. The people mirror their ruler swiftly as shadow follows form; policies must be prudent." Emperor Wen agreed and canceled the appointment.  

As the emperor mounted his chariot, he summoned Zhang Shizhi to ride beside him. They proceeded slowly while discussing Qin’s failings. Zhang Shizhi answered candidly. Upon returning, the emperor appointed him Commandant of the Capital Gates.  

Soon after, the Crown Prince and Prince of Liang entered the palace grounds in a carriage without dismounting at the Sima Gate. Zhang Shizhi stopped them and impeached both for "failing to show reverence at the imperial gate." Empress Dowager Bo intervened. Emperor Wen removed his cap in apology: "I failed to teach my sons well." Only after Empress Dowager Bo issued a pardon were they admitted. Emperor Wen, impressed, appointed Zhang Shizhi Grand Master.  

Later, as General of the Palace Guard, Zhang Shizhi accompanied Emperor Wen to Baling. Standing at the northern tomb ledge with Lady Shen, the emperor pointed toward Xinfeng Road: "This leads to Handan." He had Lady Shen play the se, singing mournfully: "If my coffin were sealed with Beishan stone, hemp paste, and lacquer—could it ever be disturbed?" All attendants praised the idea. Zhang Shizhi stepped forward: "If entombed with treasures, even a bronze-sealed coffin invites violation. With nothing desirable inside, a stone coffin matters not." Emperor Wen approved. Zhang Shizhi was later appointed Chamberlain for Law Enforcement.  

Once, while crossing Zhongwei Bridge, a man emerged beneath it, startling the imperial horses. Cavalry captured him, and Zhang Shizhi interrogated him: "I am a villager. Hearing the imperial guard’s approach, I hid under the bridge. Believing the procession passed, I emerged, saw the imperial carriage, and fled." Zhang Shizhi sentenced him to a fine for violating the imperial guard’s clearance. Emperor Wen raged: "He startled my horses! Had they not been gentle, I might have been injured. Yet you impose only a fine?" Zhang Shizhi replied: "The law binds emperor and commoner alike. To加重 punishment now would destroy public trust. Had you ordered his immediate execution, it would stand. But referred to my office—the pillar of imperial justice—any deviation tilts the scales of law nationwide, leaving the people without recourse." After long silence, the emperor conceded: "Your judgment is correct."  

When someone stole a jade ring from Gaomiao Temple, Emperor Wen ordered Zhang Shizhi to try the case. Per statute, Zhang Shizhi sentenced the thief to public execution. The emperor fumed: "He desecrated the ancestral temple! I expected extermination of his clan. Your verdict defies my duty to the ancestors." Zhang Shizhi removed his cap and kowtowed: "The law demands no more. Crimes vary by severity. If clan extermination is imposed for temple theft, what penalty remains should a fool steal a handful of earth from Changling Mausoleum?" Emperor Wen consulted Empress Dowager Bo and upheld the sentence. Zhou Yafu, Marquis of Tiao, and Wang Tiankai, Marquis of Shandu, admired Zhang Shizhi’s impartiality and befriended him. Henceforth, Zhang Shizhi was renowned throughout the realm.  

After Emperor Wen’s death, Emperor Jing ascended. Fearing reprisal, Zhang Shizhi feigned illness. He wished to resign but dreaded execution, or to apologize but feared the outcome. Following Wang Sheng’s advice, he apologized. Emperor Jing did not punish him.  

Wang Sheng, a recluse versed in Huang-Lao philosophy, once attended court. As all high officials stood present, the elderly Wang Sheng said, "My sock is loose," and commanded Zhang Shizhi: "Tie it for me!" Zhang Shizhi knelt and complied. Others questioned Wang Sheng: "Why humiliate Chamberlain Zhang?" Wang Sheng answered: "I am old and lowly. Knowing I could never aid him, I slighted him publicly so his humility might elevate his renown." All then esteemed both Wang Sheng and Zhang Shizhi.  

Zhang Shizhi served Emperor Jing briefly as Chancellor to the Prince of Huainan—likely due to past offenses. He died years later. His son Zhang Zhi, styled Changgong, rose to Grand Master but resigned. Unable to conform to his era, he never held office again.  

Feng Tang’s grandfather was from Zhao. His father moved to Dai, then to Anling under Han. Renowned for filial piety, Feng Tang served as Chief of the Palace Guard under Emperor Wen. Riding past, the emperor asked: "Why are you, an elder, a guardsman? Where is your home?" Feng Tang answered truthfully. Emperor Wen said: "While in Dai, my steward Gao Qu often praised Zhao general Li Qi’s valor at Julu. Even now, I think of Julu at every meal. Do you know him?" Feng Tang replied: "He paled beside Lian Po and Li Mu." The emperor asked why. Feng Tang said: "My grandfather commanded troops in Zhao under Li Mu. My father, as Chancellor of Dai, knew Li Qi well." Hearing of Lian Po and Li Mu’s deeds, Emperor Wen sighed: "If only I had generals like them! Would I fear the Xiongnu then?" Feng Tang said: "Forgive my bluntness—even with such generals, Your Majesty could not use them." Enraged, the emperor retreated to his chambers. Later, he summoned Feng Tang: "Why shame me publicly?" Feng Tang apologized: "This rustic knows no restraint."  

When the Xiongnu invaded Chaona, killing Commandant Ang of Beidi, Emperor Wen sought Feng Tang’s counsel: "Why say I could not use Lian Po or Li Mu?" Feng Tang answered: "Ancient kings entrusted generals by kneeling before their chariots, saying: ‘Affairs within the capital are mine; beyond it, yours.’ Rewards were decided on campaign. My grandfather said Li Mu used border market taxes to feast his troops, deciding rewards independently. Thus, he mobilized 1,300 chariots, 13,000 archers, and 100,000 elite soldiers—crushing the Xiongnu, Donghu, and Danlin, restraining Qin, and repelling Han and Wei. Zhao neared hegemony until King Qian, misled by Guo Kai, executed Li Mu. Defeat followed. Now, Commandant Wei Shang of Yunzhong feeds his troops with market taxes and personal funds, slaughtering cattle every fifth day for feasts. Thus, the Xiongnu avoid Yunzhong. Yet when his reported beheadings fell six short, you jailed him, stripped his rank, and sentenced him to penal servitude. Your laws are too exacting, rewards too meager, punishments too harsh. With such rules, even Lian Po or Li Mu would be useless." Emperor Wen rejoiced. That day, he sent Feng Tang with credentials to pardon Wei Shang and restore him as Governor of Yunzhong. Feng Tang was appointed Commandant of Chariots and Cavalry.  

Seven years later, Emperor Jing made Feng Tang Chancellor of Chu, but he was dismissed. Under Emperor Wu, Feng Tang was recommended for office but declined due to age (over ninety). His son Feng Sui became a guardsman. Sui, styled Wangsun, was an extraordinary man and my friend.  

The Grand Historian remarks: Zhang Ji’s words on integrity and unyielding adherence to law; Feng Gong’s discourse on generals—profound indeed! As the saying goes: "To know a man, see his friends." Both men’s deeds belong in the temple of state. The Documents say: "Without partiality or faction, the kingly way is vast; without faction or partiality, the kingly way is level." Zhang Ji and Feng Gong embodied this.   [end of text]
