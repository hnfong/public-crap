(1) English Translation:
When Marquis Wu of Wei had decided on a matter properly, and none of his ministers could match him, he retired from court with a pleased expression. Wu Qi approached him and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu spoken by those around you?" Marquis Wu asked, "What were the words of King Zhuang of Chu?" Wu Qi replied, "When King Zhuang of Chu had decided on a matter properly, and none of his ministers could match him, he retired from court with a worried expression. Shen Gong Wuchen asked him, 'You have a worried expression after court, why is that?' King Zhuang said, 'As I decided on a matter properly, and none of my ministers could match me, that's why I'm worried. There's a saying in Zhongyu, "A ruler who finds a teacher among his subjects will reign as king, one who finds a friend will be a hegemon, one who finds critics will survive, and one who plots alone without anyone to match him will perish." Now, with my incompetence, none of my ministers can match me, our country is almost doomed to perish! That's why I'm worried.' King Zhuang was worried, while you are pleased."

Marquis Wu, after some hesitation, bowed twice and said, "It's as if heaven has sent you to correct my mistakes."

(2) The moral of the story is that a leader should value the wisdom and capability of his subordinates. It's a warning against arrogance and overconfidence, and an encouragement for a leader to surround himself with people who can challenge and improve him, as this is the key to a successful reign.

(3) The concepts in the story do have a counterpart in Western (European) thought. The idea of surrounding oneself with people who can challenge and improve one's own thinking is akin to the concept of the "Counsel of the Wise" in Greek philosophy, and the idea of a leader being wary of overconfidence and arrogance is a common theme in European political and philosophical discourse. The story also echoes the idea of "The Tyranny of the Stupid" in European thought, where a leader's overestimation of his own abilities can lead to his downfall. The concept of "The Tyrant and the Wise Man" in European literature also shares similarities, where the wise man often corrects the tyrant's mistakes. This is also reflected in the idea of "The Prince" in Machiavellian thought, where a ruler must be adaptable and open to advice to maintain power. 

In a more general sense, the story aligns with the Western concept of meritocracy and the value of critical thinking and intellectual challenge. It also resonates with the Western philosophical idea that true wisdom is knowing one's own ignorance, as expressed by Socrates. [end of text]
