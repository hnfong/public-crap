Alright, I need to translate this passage from 荀子 into English, keep the proper names in Chinese, explain the moral of the story, and determine if the concepts have counterparts in Western thought. Let's start by understanding the content.

First, the passage is about Wei Wuhou, who is planning something and doing it correctly, so his ministers can't match him. After the meeting, he looks happy. Then, Wu Qi asks if he's heard about what Chu Zhuangwang said. Wu Qi explains that Chu Zhuangwang also planned something correctly, but he looked worried. When asked why, Zhuangwang said he was worried because his ministers couldn't match him, fearing his country might be in danger. So, while Zhuangwang was worried, Wei Wuhou is happy. Wu Qi tells Wei Wuhou that he should be worried like Zhuangwang.

The moral seems to be about humility and recognizing one's own limitations, even when things seem to be going well. It's about not being complacent and being aware of potential dangers.

Now, do these concepts exist in Western thought? Yes, in Western philosophy, there's the idea of humility and the awareness of one's own limitations, which is a key part of many ethical and philosophical systems.

**Translation:**

Wei Wuhou was planning something and did it correctly, so his ministers could not match him. After the meeting, he had a happy expression. Wu Qi then said, "Have you ever heard of what Chu Zhuangwang said to those around him?" Wei Wuhou replied, "What did Chu Zhuangwang say?" Wu Qi answered, "Chu Zhuangwang also planned something correctly, so his ministers could not match him. After the meeting, he had a worried expression. When asked, 'Why do you have a worried expression today?', Zhuangwang said, 'I planned correctly, and my ministers could not match me, so I am worried. The saying goes: 'If a ruler can find a teacher, he will become a king; if he can find a friend, he will become a hegemon; if he can find someone to doubt him, he will survive; if he relies solely on his own plans and no one can match him, his country will almost perish.' Now, because of my lack of ability, and my ministers cannot match me, our country is almost in danger! That is why I am worried.' Chu Zhuangwang was worried, but you, Wei Wuhou, are happy." Wu Qi told Wei Wuhou, "The heavens have sent you, Sir Wu Qi, to correct my mistakes."

**Moral of the Story:**

The story teaches the importance of humility and self-awareness. Even when things seem to be going well, one should remain humble and recognize the potential for danger or the limitations of one's own abilities. It warns against complacency and the dangers of overconfidence, emphasizing the need to be cautious and aware of one's own shortcomings.

**Correspondence with Western Thought:**

Yes, the concepts in the story have counterparts in Western thought. In Western philosophy, humility and the awareness of one's own limitations are central themes in various ethical and moral philosophies. For example, in Socratic philosophy, Socrates famously claimed to know nothing, highlighting the importance of recognizing one's ignorance. Additionally, in existentialism, there is an emphasis on individual responsibility and the awareness of one's own mortality and limitations. These ideas resonate with the moral of the story, where recognizing one's own shortcomings and the potential for danger is crucial for personal and societal well-being.
