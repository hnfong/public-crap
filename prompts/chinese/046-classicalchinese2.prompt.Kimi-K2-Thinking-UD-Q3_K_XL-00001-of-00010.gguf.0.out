The user asks me to:
1. Translate a passage from Xunzi (荀子) into English, keeping proper names in Chinese
2. Explain the moral of the story
3. Discuss whether these concepts have counterparts in Western/European thought

Let me first understand the passage:

魏武侯 (Marquis Wu of Wei) is planning affairs and getting them right, his ministers cannot match him. He leaves court with a happy expression. 吳起 (Wu Qi) approaches and says: "Have you ever heard the words of 楚莊王 (King Zhuang of Chu) from those around you?" The Marquis asks what King Zhuang's words were. Wu Qi replies: "King Zhuang of Chu planned affairs and got them right, his ministers could not match him, and he left court with a worried expression. 申公巫臣 (Shen Gong Wuchen) approached and asked: 'Your Majesty has a worried expression after court, why?' The King said: 'I plan affairs and get them right, my ministers cannot match me, and this is why I worry. There is a saying in the Zhonglü (中蘬): "A ruler who obtains a teacher for himself will be a true king; one who obtains friends will be a hegemon; one who obtains those who question him will survive; one who plans for himself and has no one as good as himself will perish." Now, with my lack of virtue, if my ministers cannot match me, my state is almost doomed! This is why I worry.' King Zhuang of Chu worried, but you, my lord, are happy." The Marquis hesitated and bowed twice, saying: "Heaven has sent you, master, to correct my faults."

Wait, let me re-read more carefully. The text says "其在中蘬之言也" - "there is a saying in the Zhonglü". Zhonglü is likely a classical text or collection of sayings. The quote is: "諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。"

Let me parse this quote:
- 諸侯自為得師者王: A feudal lord who obtains a teacher for himself will become a true king
- 得友者霸: One who obtains friends will become a hegemon
- 得疑者存: One who obtains those who question/doubt him will survive
- 自為謀而莫己若者亡: One who plans for himself and has no one as good as himself will perish

The key insight is that a ruler should not be the smartest person in the room. If all ministers are inferior, the state is in danger. The ruler needs advisors who are better than him in various ways.

Now for the translation:

魏武侯: Marquis Wu of Wei (or Duke Wu of Wei)
吳起: Wu Qi (a famous military strategist and politician)
楚莊王: King Zhuang of Chu
申公巫臣: Shen Gong Wuchen (a minister)

The story is from Xunzi, but it's actually a story about historical figures. Wu Qi is speaking to Marquis Wu of Wei.

Let me translate carefully:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。
Marquis Wu of Wei was planning affairs and getting them right, none of his ministers could match him, and he left court with a pleased expression.

吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」
Wu Qi stepped forward and said: "Have you ever heard, from those around you, the words of King Zhuang of Chu?"

武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」
Marquis Wu said: "What were King Zhuang of Chu's words?"

吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。
Wu Qi replied: "King Zhuang of Chu planned affairs and got them right, none of his ministers could match him, and he left court with a worried expression.

申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』
Shen Gong Wuchen approached and asked: 'Your Majesty has a worried expression after court, why is that?'

莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。
King Zhuang said: 'I plan affairs and get them right, none of my ministers can match me, and this is why I worry.

其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」
There is a saying in the Zhonglü which states: "A feudal lord who obtains a teacher for himself will become a true king; one who obtains friends will become a hegemon; one who obtains those who question him will survive; one who plans for himself and has no one as good as himself will perish."

今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。
Now, with my lack of virtue, if my ministers cannot match me, my state is almost doomed! This is why I worry.'

楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」
King Zhuang of Chu was worried, but you, my lord, are pleased."

武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」
Marquis Wu hesitated and bowed twice, saying: "Heaven has sent you, master, to correct my faults."

Now for the moral:
The moral is that a ruler should not rejoice in being superior to his ministers. If the ruler is the most capable person in the state, it means there are no talented people to advise him, which will lead to the state's downfall. A wise ruler seeks out and values advisors who are more capable than himself in various areas. The story contrasts King Zhuang of Chu's wise worry with Marquis Wu of Wei's foolish pleasure. The true measure of a good ruler is not his personal superiority, but his ability to attract and utilize superior talent.

The concepts:
1. 得師者王 (Obtaining a teacher makes one a true king) - the importance of having mentors/superior advisors
2. 得友者霸 (Obtaining friends makes one a hegemon) - the importance of capable peers/collaborators
3. 得疑者存 (Obtaining questioners makes one survive) - the importance of having people who challenge you
4. 自為謀而莫己若者亡 (Planning for yourself with no one as good as you leads to destruction) - the danger of being the smartest person in the room

This is about the importance of surrounding oneself with capable advisors, being humble, and recognizing that collective wisdom surpasses individual wisdom.

For Western counterparts:
This is similar to several Western concepts:
- Socratic wisdom: "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing" - the idea that recognizing one's own ignorance is wisdom
- Machiavelli's advice to princes about seeking counsel
- The idea of "the wisdom of crowds" or collective intelligence
- The concept of intellectual humility in leadership
- Peter Principle or Dunning-Kruger effect (inverse relationship between competence and confidence)
- The idea that a leader should be a "first among equals" or have a "cabinet of rivals"
- In management theory: hiring people smarter than you, building a strong team

Let me think of specific parallels:
- Socrates: "I know that I know nothing" - the wise person recognizes their own limitations
- Plato's philosopher-king ideally seeks counsel
- Aristotle's concept of the magnanimous man still needing friends
- Machiavelli in "The Prince" emphasizes the importance of good counsel
- In modern management: Jim Collins' "Level 5 Leadership" - humility is key
- The saying "If you're the smartest person in the room, you're in the wrong room"
- The concept of "intellectual humility" in leadership
