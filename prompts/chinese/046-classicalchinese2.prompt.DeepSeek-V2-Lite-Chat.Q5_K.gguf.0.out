User: This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

Assistant: 1. Translation of the story:

In ancient China, there was a story about Wei Wu侯 planning a successful strategy, and all his ministers were unable to match it. After the court session, Wei Wu侯露出喜悦之色. Wu Go侯 approached and said, "Have you ever heard any words from the king of Chu, Zhuang Wang, from the stories around you?" Wei Wu侯 asked, "What did the king of Chu say?" Wu Go responded, "Zhuang Wang's words were that when he had successful strategies, all his ministers couldn't match him, and after the court session, he wore a worried look. Gong Shi, the chief advisor, asked him, 'Your Highness looks worried after the court session. Why is that?' Zhuang Wang said, 'I am worried because my strategies are successful, but all my ministers are unable to match them. In the sayings of Zhong Nong, it says, 'A king is honored when he has teachers; a ruler is respected when he has friends; a ruler remains when he has doubts, but a ruler falls when he relies only on his own plans.' Now that I, who am not outstanding, have strategies that all my ministers can't match, could our state be on the verge of extinction? That is why I am worried.' The king of Chu was worried, but you are happy.” Wei Wu侯 hesitated and then bowed repeatedly, saying, "Heaven has sent you to correct my mistakes."

2. Explanation of the moral of the story:

The moral of this story is to remain humble and cautious even after achieving success. It teaches that leaders should not become complacent when things go well, but should instead acknowledge the team's contribution and be aware of the potential for failure. It is better to be cautious and aware of potential shortcomings than to be overly confident and risk future setbacks.

3. Counterparts in Western thought:

The concepts in this story can be compared to the teachings of the ancient Greek philosopher, Aristotle. In his work, "Nicomachean Ethics," Aristotle emphasized the importance of eudaimonia (happiness or flourishing) achieved through virtue, which includes a balanced state of mind and recognizing the role of fate or chance in one's achievements. Additionally, the Stoic philosophy, which was popular in ancient Greece and Rome, also emphasized the importance of maintaining a balanced state of mind and not being overly affected by external circumstances, even when they are positive. These philosophies share a similar moral with the story from "Xunzi," which is to remain humble and cautious in the face of success.
