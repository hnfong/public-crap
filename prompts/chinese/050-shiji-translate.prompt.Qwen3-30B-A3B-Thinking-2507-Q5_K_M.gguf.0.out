Okay, let's tackle this translation request. The user provided a Chinese historical text from the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji) and wants it translated into English with specific instructions about proper names.

First, I need to make sure I understand the requirements clearly. The key points are:
- Do not transliterate proper names (people, emperors, places). Use the original Chinese terms instead.
- No explanations, just the translated text.
- If in doubt, use a more literal translation.

Hmm, the user emphasized not to transliterate proper names. So for example, "張釋之" should stay as 張釋之, not "Zhang Shizhi". But wait, the user says "use the original Chinese to avoid inconsistency in transliteration." So I should keep the Chinese characters as they are in the translation. Wait, but the translation is supposed to be in English. Wait, maybe they mean to keep the Chinese names as they are written in the original text, not to convert them to English spellings. So for instance, "張釋之" remains 張釋之 in the English translation, not "Zhang Shizhi". But the user says "translate to English", so maybe they want the Chinese names kept as is, without transliteration. So the English text will have Chinese characters for names.

Wait, but the user says "For proper names (of people, emperors, places) please use the original Chinese to avoid inconsistency in transliteration." So instead of writing "Zhang Shizhi", they want the Chinese characters. So the translation should include the Chinese characters for names, not the English transliteration. So the translated text will have Chinese names like 張釋之, not "Zhang Shizhi".

But the user also says "Translate the following to English." So the main text should be in English, but proper names remain in Chinese characters. So for example, "張廷尉釋之者" becomes "Zhang Tingwei Shi Zhi" in English? Wait, no. Wait, the instruction says "use the original Chinese", so the Chinese characters themselves should be kept. So the translation would have the Chinese characters for the names, not the English transliteration. But the rest of the text is translated into English.

Wait, but the user provided the Chinese text, and wants it translated to English. So the Chinese characters for names should stay as they are, and the rest of the text is translated. So for example, "張釋之" would remain as 張釋之 in the English translation, but the surrounding text is in English. Wait, but that's not standard. Usually, in English translations of Chinese texts, proper names are transliterated. But the user specifically says not to transliterate, so they want the Chinese characters preserved.

Wait, the user says: "For proper names (of people, emperors, places) please use the original Chinese to avoid inconsistency in transliteration." So "original Chinese" meaning the Chinese characters, not the transliteration. So in the English translation, the names should be written in Chinese characters. So for example, "張釋之" stays as 張釋之, not "Zhang Shizhi".

But the user also says "Translate the following to English." So the entire text should be in English, except for the proper names which are kept in Chinese. So the translation would have English sentences with Chinese characters for names. For example, "Zhang Tingwei Shi Zhi was from Duyang..." but no, the user says not to transliterate, so it's "張廷尉釋之者, 堵陽人也, 字季." translated as "Zhang Tingwei Shi Zhi, a native of Duyang, styled Ji." Wait, no. Wait, the user says "use the original Chinese", so the name should be kept as 張釋之, not transliterated. So the translation would have the Chinese characters for the name, but the rest of the text in English.

Wait, but the user provided the Chinese text, and wants it translated to English. So the Chinese characters for the names should remain as they are in the translation. So the translated text would have the Chinese characters for names like 張釋之, and the rest of the text translated into English. So for example, "張釋之" becomes "張釋之" in the English translation, not "Zhang Shizhi".

But that's a bit confusing because the translation is supposed to be in English. However, the user is very specific about not transliterating proper names. So I need to make sure that all proper names (people, places, etc.) are kept as Chinese characters, not converted to English.

Let me check the example given in the user's instruction. They mention "proper names (of people, emperors, places) please use the original Chinese". So "original Chinese" refers to the Chinese characters. So in the translation, those names should appear as Chinese characters, not as English words.

So for instance, "張釋之" remains 張釋之, "堵陽" remains 堵陽, "孝文帝" remains 孝文帝, etc.

Wait, but "孝文帝" is the title of the emperor. The user says "proper names (of people, emperors, places)", so "孝文帝" is the emperor's title, which should be kept as is. So in the translation, it's "Xiao Wen Emperor" or "Xiao Wen Di"? But the user says not to transliterate, so maybe keep it as 孝文帝. But the user says "use the original Chinese", so the Chinese characters. So the translation would have 孝文帝 written as 孝文帝, not "Emperor Xiao Wen".

Wait, but the user says "translate to English", so the title should be translated, but the name of the emperor is a proper name. Wait, the user says "proper names (of people, emperors, places) please use the original Chinese". So the name of the emperor is a proper name, so it should be kept as 孝文帝. But "孝文帝" is a Chinese title. So in the translation, it's kept as 孝文帝, not "Emperor Xiao Wen".

But this is a bit confusing. Let me think. In standard practice, when translating Chinese historical texts, the emperor's title is usually translated (e.g., "Emperor Wen of Han"), but the user specifically says not to transliterate proper names. So "孝文帝" is the proper name, so it should remain as 孝文帝. But the user might mean that the name should not be transliterated, so for example, "Zhang" should not be written as "Chang" or something. Wait, no. The user says "use the original Chinese", so the Chinese characters. So the translation should have the Chinese characters for the names, not the English transliteration.

Wait, but the user provided the Chinese text, and wants it translated to English. So the Chinese characters for the names should stay as they are in the translation. So the translated text will have English sentences with Chinese characters for names. For example:

"Zhang Tingwei Shi Zhi was from Duyang, styled Ji."

But no, the user says not to transliterate, so it should be:

"張廷尉釋之者，堵陽人也，字季。"

Wait, no. The user wants the Chinese text translated to English, but keeping the proper names as Chinese characters. So the translation would be:

"Zhang Tingwei Shi Zhi, a native of Duyang, styled Ji. His elder brother Zhong lived with him. He became a cavalry officer due to his wealth, serving Emperor Xiao Wen. For ten years he was not promoted, and thus was not well-known. Zhang Shizhi said, 'After so long in office, my elder brother's assets have diminished, and I have not succeeded. I wish to resign and return home.' The Middle General Yuan Ang knew his worth and regretted his departure, so he requested that Zhang Shizhi be transferred to the position of Envoy. After Zhang Shizhi had finished his audience, he approached to speak of matters of benefit. Emperor Xiao Wen said, 'Speak humbly, do not speak of lofty theories; make sure what you say can be put into practice now.' Thus Zhang Shizhi spoke of matters between the Qin and Han dynasties, explaining why the Qin lost and the Han gained, for a long time. Emperor Xiao Wen praised him, and appointed Zhang Shizhi as Envoy's Deputy."

Wait, but in this example, I transliterated "張釋之" as "Zhang Shizhi", which the user says not to do. So instead, it should be "張釋之" in the translation. But how? The translation is supposed to be in English, so the Chinese characters would be part of the English text. So the translation would have Chinese characters for the names.

But that's not standard. However, the user is very insistent on not transliterating, so I have to follow that.

So for example, "張釋之" becomes "張釋之" in the English translation, not "Zhang Shizhi".

Similarly, "堵陽" becomes "堵陽", "孝文帝" becomes "孝文帝", etc.

So the translated text will have English sentences with Chinese characters for proper names.

Wait, but the user provided the Chinese text, and wants it translated to English. So the Chinese characters for the names should remain as they are, and the rest of the text is translated. So the translation would look like:

"張廷尉釋之者，堵陽人也，字季。有兄仲同居。以訾為騎郎，事孝文帝，十歲不得調，無所知名。..."

But that's the original Chinese. The user wants it translated to English, so the Chinese text should be converted to English, but the proper names kept as Chinese characters.

Wait, maybe the user means that for proper names, instead of using a transliteration (like "Zhang Shizhi"), they want the Chinese characters (張釋之) to be used in the translation. So the translation would have the Chinese characters for the names, not the English spelling.

So the translation would be in English, but with Chinese characters for names. For example:

"Zhang Tingwei Shi Zhi, a native of Duyang, styled Ji. His elder brother Zhong lived with him. He became a cavalry officer due to his wealth, serving 孝文帝, for ten years he was not promoted, and thus was not well-known."

But "孝文帝" should remain as 孝文帝, not "Emperor Xiao Wen".

Wait, but "孝文帝" is the title. The user says "proper names (of people, emperors, places)", so "孝文帝" is the emperor's title, which is a proper name, so it should be kept as 孝文帝.

So in the translation, it's "serving 孝文帝".

Similarly, "堵陽" is a place, so it's kept as 堵陽.

Okay, so the main points are:

- All proper names (people, emperors, places) are kept as Chinese characters in the translation.
- The rest of the text is translated into English.
- No explanations, just the translated text.

Now, I need to go through the Chinese text and translate it to English, keeping the Chinese characters for names.

Let me start translating the first paragraph.

《張釋之馮唐列傳》
This is the title, so it's "Biography of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang" but since the user says not to transliterate, the title should be kept as 《張釋之馮唐列傳》. Wait, but the user says "translate to English", so the title should be translated. However, the user says "for proper names... use the original Chinese". The title isn't a proper name, so it should be translated. But the user might want the title translated. Let's check the example. The user provided the Chinese title, so the translation should have the English title. But the user's instruction says "For proper names (of people, emperors, places) please use the original Chinese". The title isn't a proper name, so it should be translated. So "Biography of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang" but since the user says not to transliterate, maybe the title should be translated as "Biography of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang" but the names are proper names, so they should be kept as Chinese. Wait, the title is a title of a chapter, so it's not a proper name. So the title should be translated to English. So "Biography of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang" but the user says not to transliterate, so maybe the title should be "Biography of 張釋之 and 馮唐". But the user says "translate to English", so the title should be in English. Hmm.

Wait, the user's instruction says "Translate the following to English." So the entire text, including the title, should be translated to English. But for proper names within the text, use the original Chinese. So the title is not a proper name, so it's translated. So "Biography of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang" but the user says not to transliterate, so maybe the title should be "Biography of 張釋之 and 馮唐". But that's mixing Chinese and English. The user might want the title translated, but the names kept as Chinese. So "Biography of 張釋之 and 馮唐".

But the user's example in the instruction says "For proper names (of people, emperors, places) please use the original Chinese", so the names in the title are proper names, so they should be kept as Chinese. So the title becomes "Biography of 張釋之 and 馮唐".

But I'm not sure. Let's proceed with translating the title as "Biography of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang" but the user says not to transliterate, so it's better to keep the Chinese characters. So "Biography of 張釋之 and 馮唐".

Wait, but the user says "translate to English", so the title should be in English. However, the instruction says for proper names, use the original Chinese. So the title's proper names (張釋之 and 馮唐) should be kept as Chinese. So the title translation would be "Biography of 張釋之 and 馮唐".

Okay, moving on.

The first line: 《張釋之馮唐列傳》 → "Biography of 張釋之 and 馮唐"

Next: 張廷尉釋之者，堵陽人也，字季。有兄仲同居。

"Zhang Tingwei Shi Zhi, a native of Duyang, styled Ji. His elder brother Zhong lived with him."

But according to the user's instruction, don't transliterate, so "Zhang Tingwei Shi Zhi" should be 張廷尉釋之. Wait, no. The user says "use the original Chinese" for proper names. So "張廷尉釋之" is the name, so it should be kept as 張廷尉釋之. But "張廷尉釋之" is a title and name. Wait, "張廷尉釋之" is "Zhang Tingwei Shi Zhi", where "廷尉" is the title (Minister of Justice), "釋之" is the name. So the proper name is 張釋之, and "廷尉" is his title. So in the translation, the title should be translated, but the name kept as Chinese.

Wait, the user says "proper names (of people, emperors, places)", so "張釋之" is the person's name, so it should be kept as 張釋之. "廷尉" is a title, not a proper name, so it should be translated as "Minister of Justice".

So "Zhang Tingwei Shi Zhi" → "Minister of Justice Zhang Shizhi" but since the name shouldn't be transliterated, it's "Minister of Justice 張釋之".

Wait, but the user says "use the original Chinese" for proper names, so the name 張釋之 should be kept as is. So the translation would be "Minister of Justice 張釋之, a native of Duyang, styled Ji."

Similarly, "堵陽" is a place, so it's kept as 堵陽.

"以訾為騎郎，事孝文帝，十歲不得調，無所知名。"

"Due to his wealth, he became a cavalry officer, serving 孝文帝, for ten years he was not promoted, and thus was not well-known."

"孝文帝" is the emperor's title, so it's kept as 孝文帝.

"釋之曰：「久宦減仲之產，不遂。」欲自免歸。"

"Zhang Shizhi said, 'After so long in office, my elder brother's assets have diminished, and I have not succeeded.' He wished to resign and return home."

But "釋之" should be 張釋之, so "Zhang Shizhi" becomes 張釋之.

Wait, no. The user says not to transliterate, so "釋之" is part of the name, so it should be kept as 張釋之. So the translation would have 張釋之.

So the sentence would be: "張釋之 said, 'After so long in office, my elder brother's assets have diminished, and I have not succeeded.' He wished to resign and return home."

But "張釋之" is the name, so it's kept as 張釋之.

Wait, but in the translation, the name should be written as 張釋之, not "Zhang Shizhi". So the translated text will have Chinese characters for the name.

So the translation will look like:

Biography of 張釋之 and 馮唐

張廷尉釋之者，堵陽人也，字季。有兄仲同居。以訾為騎郎，事孝文帝，十歲不得調，無所知名。張釋之曰：「久宦減仲之產，不遂。」欲自免歸。中郎將袁盎知其賢，惜其去，乃請徙釋之補謁者。釋之既朝畢，因前言便宜事。文帝曰：「卑之，毋甚高論，令今可施行也。」於是釋之言秦漢之閒事，秦所以失而漢所以興者久之。文帝稱善，乃拜釋之為謁者仆射。

Wait, but this is the original Chinese. The user wants it translated to English. So the Chinese text should be converted to English, but with proper names kept as Chinese characters.

So the first line: "張廷尉釋之者，堵陽人也，字季。" becomes "Minister of Justice 張釋之, a native of 堵陽, styled Ji."

But "Minister of Justice" is the translation of "廷尉", which is a title, not a proper name, so it's translated. "張釋之" is the name, kept as Chinese.

Similarly, "孝文帝" is the emperor's title, so it's kept as 孝文帝.

So the translation would be:

Biography of 張釋之 and 馮唐

Minister of Justice 張釋之 was from Duyang, styled Ji. He had an elder brother named Zhong living with him. Due to his wealth, he became a cavalry officer, serving 孝文帝. For ten years he was not promoted, and thus was not well-known. 張釋之 said, "After so long in office, my elder brother's assets have diminished, and I have not succeeded." He wished to resign and return home. The Middle General Yuan Ang knew his worth and regretted his departure, so he requested that 張釋之 be transferred to the position of Envoy. After 張
