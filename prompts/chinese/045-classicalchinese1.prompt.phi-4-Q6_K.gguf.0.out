Q1: **Summary of the Story (5 points)**

The story from "滑稽列传" describes how Western Gate Hao, serving as the magistrate of Ye, addressed a local superstition and corruption. The people of Ye were impoverished because they were forced to contribute money to select young women as brides for the River God, who were then drowned. Hao exposed the deceit by pretending to send the chosen women to the river, but instead threw the shamans and elders into the water. This act ended the practice, and Hao subsequently improved the region by constructing irrigation canals, enhancing agricultural productivity and prosperity.

Q2: **Victims in the Story (2 points)**

The victims were typically young women from poor families, chosen by shamans and elders to be sacrificed as brides for the River God.

Q3. **Beneficiaries of the Old Practice (2 points)**

The shamans, elders, and local officials benefited from the old practice by collecting money from the people and keeping a portion for themselves.

Q4. **Use of Wits or Force (5 points)**

The protagonist, Western Gate Hao, used wits rather than force. He cleverly exposed the shamans' deceit by pretending to send the chosen women to the river and then throwing the shamans and elders into the water, thereby ending the practice without direct violence.

Q5. **Moral Considerations (10 points)**

- **Pro-Hao Perspective:** His actions were justified as they ended a corrupt and harmful practice, saving lives and improving the community's welfare.
- **Against-Hao Perspective:** Throwing people into the river could be seen as morally questionable, as it involved deception and potential harm.
- **Neutral Perspective:** While his methods were unorthodox, the outcome was positive, suggesting that the ends justified the means in this context.

Q6. **Explanation and Fairness of the Comment (15 points)**

The comment compares the governance of three officials: Zi Chan, Zi Jian, and Western Gate Hao. It suggests that while Zi Chan's people could not deceive him, Zi Jian's people did not dare to deceive him, and Hao's people were too afraid to deceive him. This implies that Hao's methods instilled the greatest fear, which may not equate to the highest wisdom or virtue. The comment is fair in highlighting different governance styles but may overlook the positive outcomes of Hao's actions,
