(1) Here is the English translation of the passage:

When Wei Wǔhóu (魏武侯) made a decision that was correct, none of his ministers could match it, and he had a look of satisfaction after the court session. Wú Qǐ (吴起) approached and said, "Have you ever heard of the words of Chǔ Zhuāngwáng (楚庄王) on the left or right of you?" Wei Wǔhóu asked, "What did Chǔ Zhuāngwáng say?" Wú Qǐ replied, "When Chǔ Zhuāngwáng made a decision that was correct, none of his ministers could match it, and he had a look of worry after the court session. Shēn Gōng Wūchén (申公巫臣) asked, 'Why do you look worried after the court session?' Zhuāngwáng said, 'I made a decision that was correct, and none of my ministers could match it, so I am worried. It is said in Zhōu Zhōu's words, "A ruler who can find a teacher for himself will become a king, one who can find a friend will become a hegemon, one who can find a peer will survive, and one who cannot find anyone who can match him will perish." Now, with my lack of talent, and none of my ministers can match me, my country is almost doomed! That is why I am worried.' Chǔ Zhuāngwáng was worried, but you are happy."

Wei Wǔhóu bowed twice and said, "Heaven has sent you to correct my mistake."

(2) The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should be concerned when he finds no one who can match his wisdom or advice, as it indicates a lack of capable advisors and potential danger for the state. The story contrasts Wei Wǔhóu's complacency with Chǔ Zhuāngwáng's concern, highlighting the importance of humility and the need for a ruler to seek out and value the opinions of others.

(3) The concepts in this story have counterparts in Western thought, particularly in the ideas of leadership and the importance of a ruler's advisors. In Western philosophy, the concept of the "Mandate of Heaven" can be compared to the idea of a ruler's legitimacy being tied to their ability to govern wisely and justly. The story also echoes the Greek philosopher Plato's idea of the "philosopher-king," where a ruler's wisdom and ability to seek out and value the opinions of others are crucial for the well-being of the state.

In addition, the story's emphasis on the importance of humility and the need for a ruler to be open to the opinions of others can be compared to the ideas of the Enlightenment thinkers, such as Montesquieu, who argued for the separation of powers and the importance of checks and balances in government. The story also reflects the idea of the "mirror for princes," a genre of literature in both Eastern and Western traditions that advises rulers on how to govern wisely and justly.

Overall, the concepts in this story have parallels in Western thought, particularly in the areas of leadership, the importance of advisors, and the need for rulers to be humble and open to the opinions of others. [end of text]
