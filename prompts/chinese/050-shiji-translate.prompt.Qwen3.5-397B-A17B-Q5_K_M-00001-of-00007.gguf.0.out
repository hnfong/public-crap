"Biographies of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang"  
Zhang Tingwei Shizhi was from Duyang, courtesy name Ji. He lived together with his elder brother Zhong. He became a cavalry gentleman through payment of a property qualification, served Emperor Xiaowen, but for ten years received no promotion and remained unknown. Shizhi said, "Serving long in office diminishes Zhong's property; this will not do." He wished to resign and return home. The General of the Gentlemen of the Household, Yuan Ang, knowing his worth and regretting his departure, requested that Shizhi be transferred to fill a vacancy as an Attendant. After Shizhi completed his audience, he proceeded to speak on matters of expedience. Emperor Wen said, "Speak plainly; do not offer overly lofty theories, but propose what can be implemented now." Thereupon Shizhi spoke at length about affairs between the Qin and Han dynasties, explaining why Qin lost and Han rose. Emperor Wen praised his words and appointed Shizhi as Chief of the Attendants.  

Shizhi accompanied the emperor on an outing to the Tiger Enclosure. The emperor asked the Director of Shanglin about registers of birds and beasts; after more than ten questions, the director looked left and right, unable to answer any. A steward from the Tiger Enclosure stepped forward from the side to answer on behalf of the director regarding the registers of birds and beasts asked by the emperor, doing so very thoroughly, wishing thereby to display his ability to respond verbally without end. Emperor Wen said, "Should not officials be like this? The director is useless!" He then ordered Shizhi to appoint the steward as Commandant of Shanglin. Shizhi waited a long time before stepping forward and said, "How does Your Majesty regard Marquis of Jiang, Zhou Bo?" The emperor replied, "He is a virtuous elder." Shizhi again asked, "How does Your Majesty regard Marquis of Dongyang, Zhang Xiangru?" The emperor again replied, "He is a virtuous elder." Shizhi said, "Marquis of Jiang and Marquis of Dongyang are called virtuous elders; yet these two men could hardly speak when discussing affairs. Should we then emulate this steward, chattering glibly and fluently? Moreover, Qin employed clerks skilled with knife and brush; officials competed to excel in haste, severity, and meticulous scrutiny, yet their flaw was merely empty formalism without genuine compassion. Therefore, their faults went unheard, and gradually, by the time of the Second Emperor, the empire collapsed. Now, if Your Majesty promotes this steward solely for his verbal dexterity, I fear the whole empire will follow this trend, competing in eloquence without substance. Moreover, the transformation of the lower by the upper is swifter than shadow following form or echo responding to sound; thus, every action must be carefully considered." Emperor Wen said, "Well said." He then stopped and did not appoint the steward.  

The emperor mounted his carriage, summoned Shizhi to ride alongside, proceeded slowly, and asked Shizhi about the faults of Qin. Shizhi answered fully and frankly. Upon reaching the palace, the emperor appointed Shizhi as Commandant of the Public Carriages.  

Shortly afterward, the Crown Prince and the Prince of Liang entered the court together in the same carriage and did not dismount at the Sima Gate. Thereupon Shizhi pursued and stopped them, preventing the Crown Prince and the Prince of Liang from entering the palace gate. He then impeached them for failing to dismount at the public gate, charging them with disrespect, and submitted a memorial. Empress Dowager Bo heard of this; Emperor Wen removed his cap and apologized, saying, "I failed to instruct my sons properly." Empress Dowager Bo then sent an envoy bearing an imperial edict to pardon the Crown Prince and the Prince of Liang, after which they were allowed to enter. From this time, Emperor Wen regarded Shizhi as extraordinary and appointed him as a Grand Master.  

Soon afterward, he was promoted to General of the Gentlemen of the Household. Accompanying the emperor to Baling, they stayed north overlooking the cliff. At that time, Lady Shen accompanied them. The emperor pointed out to Lady Shen the road to Xinfeng, saying, "This is the road leading to Handan." He had Lady Shen play the se zither, while he himself leaned on the zither and sang, his mood sorrowful and mournful. Turning to his ministers, he said, "Alas! If we make the outer coffin from stones of the Northern Mountain, pack it with hemp and silk, seal the joints with lacquer, how could it ever be disturbed?" All attendants said, "Well said." Shizhi stepped forward and said, "If there are desirable things inside, even if sealed within the Southern Mountain, there will still be cracks; if there is nothing desirable inside, even without a stone coffin, what cause for worry?" Emperor Wen praised his words. Soon afterward, he appointed Shizhi as Commandant of Justice.  

Shortly afterward, the emperor traveled out through the Middle Wei Bridge. A man emerged from beneath the bridge, startling the imperial horses. The emperor ordered cavalry to arrest him and handed him over to the Commandant of Justice. Shizhi interrogated him. The man said, "I came from the county, heard the imperial procession approaching, hid under the bridge. After a long time, thinking the procession had passed, I emerged, saw the imperial carriage and cavalry, and ran away." The Commandant of Justice, following legal precedent, ruled that one person violating the imperial procession should be fined. Emperor Wen angrily said, "This man personally startled my horse; fortunately my horse is gentle. Had it been another horse, would it not have thrown me and caused injury? Yet the Commandant of Justice merely fines him!" Shizhi replied, "The law is what the Son of Heaven shares with all under heaven. Now, if the law stipulates thus but you impose a heavier penalty, the law will lose credibility among the people. Moreover, at that moment, if Your Majesty had ordered his immediate execution, it would have been done. But now that you have referred the case to the Commandant of Justice—the Commandant of Justice represents the balance of justice for all under heaven. Once tilted, all application of law throughout the empire will become arbitrary; where then can the people place their hands and feet? I beg Your Majesty to consider this." After a long pause, the emperor said, "The Commandant of Justice is correct."  

Later, someone stole a jade ring from before the seat in the Gao Temple. He was captured. Emperor Wen, enraged, handed the case to the Commandant of Justice for trial. Shizhi, consulting the statutes, memorialized that stealing ritual vessels or garments from the ancestral temple warranted public execution. The emperor, greatly angered, said, "This man's lack of morality led him to steal vessels from the temple of the Former Emperor. I entrusted this to the Commandant of Justice wishing his entire clan exterminated, yet you apply the law and propose only execution. This does not reflect my intention to reverently uphold the ancestral temple." Shizhi removed his cap, kowtowed, and apologized, saying, "The law as it stands is sufficient. Moreover, though crimes may be equal, distinctions must be made based on rebellion versus obedience. Now, if stealing temple vessels warrants extermination of the clan, suppose some ignorant commoner takes merely a handful of earth from Changling—how could Your Majesty increase the penalty beyond that?" After a long time, Emperor Wen discussed this with the Empress Dowager and then approved the judgment of the Commandant of Justice. At that time, the Colonel of the Guards, Marquis of Tiao, Zhou Yafu, and the Chancellor of Liang, Marquis of Shangdu, Wang Tiankai, seeing that Shizhi upheld impartial judgments, formed close friendships with him. From this time, Commandant Zhang was praised throughout the empire.  

Afterward, Emperor Wen died, and Emperor Jing ascended the throne. Shizhi, fearful, claimed illness. He wished to resign and depart but feared severe punishment; he wished to appear and apologize but did not know how. Following the advice of Wang Sheng, he finally appeared and apologized; Emperor Jing did not punish him.  

Wang Sheng was skilled in the teachings of Huang and Lao, a recluse. Once summoned to sit in the court, when all the Three Excellencies and Nine Ministers were assembled standing, Wang Sheng, an old man, said, "My sock has come undone," and turning to Commandant Zhang, said, "Tie it for me!" Shizhi knelt and tied it. Afterward, someone said to Wang Sheng, "Why alone humiliate Commandant Zhang in court, making him kneel to tie your sock?" Wang Sheng replied, "I am old and lowly; I judged that ultimately I could bring no benefit to Commandant Zhang. Commandant Zhang is now a renowned minister of the empire; therefore, I merely humiliated him in court, making him kneel to tie my sock, wishing thereby to enhance his reputation." When the nobles heard this, they esteemed Wang Sheng and respected Commandant Zhang even more.  

Commandant Zhang served Emperor Jing for over a year, then became Chancellor to the Prince of Huainan, still bearing the stigma of past offenses. After a long time, Shizhi died. His son was Zhang Zhi, courtesy name Changgong, who rose to the rank of Grand Master but was dismissed. Because he could not curry favor with contemporaries, he never held office again throughout his life.  

Feng Tang's grandfather was from Zhao. His father moved to Dai. When Han arose, they moved to Anling. Tang was noted for filial piety and served as Chief of the Gentlemen's Office under Emperor Wen. Once, when the emperor passed by in his carriage, he asked Tang, "Old sir, how did you become a gentleman? Where is your family?" Tang answered fully and truthfully. Emperor Wen said, "When I resided in Dai, my Supervisor of Imperial Food, Gao Qu, often spoke to me of the virtue of Zhao general Li Qi, who fought below Julu. Now, whenever I eat, my thoughts never stray from Julu. Do you know of him?" Tang replied, "He was not as good a general as Lian Po or Li Mu." The emperor asked, "Why?" Tang said, "When my grandfather was in Zhao, he served as an officer under a general and knew Li Mu well. My father formerly served as Chancellor of Dai and knew Zhao general Li Qi well, understanding his character." After hearing about the characters of Lian Po and Li Mu, the emperor was greatly pleased, slapped his thigh, and exclaimed, "Alas! If only I could have Lian Po and Li Mu as my generals now, would I still worry about the Xiongnu?" Tang said, "Your subject trembles! Even if Your Majesty obtained Lian Po and Li Mu, you could not use them." The emperor, angered, rose and entered the inner palace. After a long time, he summoned Tang and rebuked him, saying, "How could you publicly humiliate me? Could you not have found a private place?" Tang apologized, saying, "This humble man did not know the taboos."  

At that time, the Xiongnu had just made a major invasion into Chaona, killing the Commandant of Beidi, Ang. The emperor, concerned about the barbarian incursion, finally asked Tang again, "How do you know I could not use Lian Po and Li Mu?" Tang replied, "I have heard that in ancient times, when kings dispatched generals, they knelt and pushed the chariot wheels, saying, 'Within the gate, I control; beyond the gate, you, General, control.' Military merits, titles, and rewards were all decided outside and reported upon return. These are not empty words. My grandfather said that when Li Mu served as Zhao's general guarding the frontier, all taxes from the military markets were used by him to feast his soldiers; rewards and gifts were decided externally without interference from the center. Authority was entrusted and success demanded; thus Li Mu was able to fully employ his wisdom and capability, dispatching thirteen hundred selected chariots, thirteen thousand armored cavalry, and one hundred thousand warriors worthy of a hundred gold each. Therefore, he drove the Chanyu northward, defeated the Donghu, destroyed the Danlin, suppressed the powerful Qin to the west, and held off Han and Wei to the south. At that time, Zhao nearly achieved hegemony. Later, when King Qian of Zhao ascended the throne—his mother being a courtesan—King Qian, upon ascending, believed the slanders of Guo Kai and ultimately executed Li Mu, appointing Yan Ju to replace him. Consequently, the army was defeated, the soldiers routed, and Zhao was captured and destroyed by Qin. Now, I have privately heard that Wei Shang, serving as Governor of Yunzhong, uses all revenues from military markets to feast his soldiers, contributes his own private funds, slaughters an ox every five days to entertain guests, military officers, and retainers. Therefore, the Xiongnu kept far away, not approaching the passes of Yunzhong. Once, when the enemy did invade, Shang led chariots and cavalry to attack them, killing many of their forces. These soldiers are all sons of families, rising from the fields to join the army; how could they know the registers and tallies? They fight with all their strength all day, beheading and capturing enemies, reporting merits to the headquarters; yet if one word does not match, clerks bind them with laws. Their rewards are not granted, yet officials strictly apply the law. Your subject, foolishly, believes Your Majesty's laws are too clear, rewards too light, and punishments too heavy. Moreover, Governor Wei Shang of Yunzhong was convicted because his report of enemy heads captured differed by six levels; Your Majesty handed him to officials, stripped his title, and sentenced him to penal labor. Speaking thus, even if Your Majesty obtained Lian Po and Li Mu, you could not use them. Your subject is truly foolish, having offended taboos; death penalty, death penalty!" Emperor Wen was pleased. That same day, he ordered Feng Tang to carry the imperial tally to pardon Wei Shang, reinstating him as Governor of Yunzhong, and appointed Tang as Commandant of Chariots and Cavalry, overseeing the Colonel of the Guards and chariot warriors of commanderies and kingdoms.  

In the seventh year, Emperor Jing ascended the throne and appointed Tang as Chancellor of Chu, but he was dismissed. When Emperor Wu ascended, seeking worthy and virtuous men, Feng Tang was recommended. At that time, Tang was over ninety years old and could no longer serve in office; therefore, his son Feng Sui was appointed as a gentleman. Sui, courtesy name Wangsun, was also an extraordinary scholar and was friendly with me.  

The Grand Historian remarks: Zhang Ji's words concerning virtuous elders and his adherence to law without currying favor; Master Feng's discussion of generals—how meaningful! How meaningful! As the saying goes, "If you do not know a person, look at his friends." The praises uttered by these two gentlemen deserve to be inscribed in the temple halls. The Book of Documents states: "Without bias or partiality, the kingly way is broad; without partiality or bias, the kingly way is smooth." Zhang Ji and Master Feng approached this ideal.
