Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. Starting with Q1. The story is about West Queen豹 as the governor of Yan. He learns that the local officials and wizards were extorting money by pretending to marry a girl to the river god. This caused people to flee, making the area poor. He outwits them by tricking the巫 into the river, then making them apologize. He then builds channels to bring water for farming. So the summary should mention his role, the problem, his clever plan, and the outcome.

Q2 asks about the type of women victims. From the text, the poor families had to give their daughters because they couldn't afford the tax. The巫 would pick young girls, dress them up, and send them to the river. So the victims were young girls from poor families, forced into this practice.

Q3: Who benefited? The officials (three old, magistrates) and the wizards (祝巫) were taking the money for the river god's wedding. They were extorting the people, so they were the ones benefiting.

Q4: Did he use wit or force? He used wit. Instead of fighting back, he tricked the巫 and officials by pretending to send the girls to the river, then punishing them by throwing them in. So it's clever strategy, not physical force.

Q5: Is it moral? Different perspectives: From the story's perspective, he saved the people and improved their lives, so it's justified. Critics might say he used unethical methods (throwing people into the river), but the outcome was positive. So it's a mix of views depending on the outcome vs. the methods.

Q6: The quote at the end compares three governors: Zi Chan, Zi Jian, and West Queen豹. It says the people can't be cheated, won't lie, and can't lie to him, respectively. The comment is asking if this is fair. The story shows West Queen豹 used clever tactics to stop the bad practice, so his method was effective. The comparison is about different approaches to governance. It might be fair because each suited their situations, but maybe it overlooks the fact that he had to use harsh methods. But the text presents him as a great leader, so the comment is probably fair in the context of the story, highlighting different governance styles.

Wait, need to make sure answers are concise and hit the points without being too wordy. Let me check each answer again for accuracy based on the text provided.

**Q1:** West Queen豹, as Yan's governor, exposed corrupt officials and wizards extorting百姓 by "marrying" girls to the river god. He outwitted them by tricking them into the river, ending the practice and redirecting resources to irrigation, enriching the land.  

**Q2:** Poor girls from families unable to resist extortions were forced into the ritual, treated as sacrifices to the river god.  

**Q3:** Local officials (三老,廷掾) and祝巫 profited by exploiting taxes and people’s fears.  

**Q4:** Wit. He manipulated the rituals to trap the corrupt, using psychological pressure (not force) to dismantle the practice.  

**Q5:** Some see it as justified—his actions saved lives and improved welfare. Others argue his methods (throwing people into rivers) were unethical. Contextually, the outcome outweighed the means, but the tactics remain controversial.  

**Q6:** The passage contrasts governance styles: 治 (Zi Chan) made people unable to lie, 治 (Zi Jian) made them unwilling, and 西門豹 made them不敢. It’s fair as it reflects different effective approaches, though it overlooks 西门豹’s harsh methods. The comment highlights governance efficacy through distinct moral and practical frameworks.
