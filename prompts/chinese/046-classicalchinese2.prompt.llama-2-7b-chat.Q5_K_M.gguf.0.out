This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

 [/INST]  (1) Translation:
Prince Wu of Wu, in his schemes, could not be caught by his ministers, and when he withdrew, he had a cheerful countenance. Wu Qi asked Prince Wu, "Is it true that the late King of Chu used to say, 'When the king's affairs are in order, his subjects will not dare to oppose him; when he withdraws, he will have a joyful countenance.'" Prince Wu replied, "Yes, that is what the late King of Chu said. He said, 'When a king is not competent to govern, his subjects will not be able to help him; when he withdraws, he will have a worried countenance.'" Wu Qi then asked, "What is the meaning of the late King of Chu's words?" Prince Wu answered, "The late King of Chu said that when a king is not competent to govern, his subjects will not be able to help him, and that is why he will have a worried countenance. This is like a person who has no rice to eat, and yet he still tries to cook a meal. He may succeed, but he will still end up with nothing to eat."
(2) The moral of the story is that a king who is incompetent or lacks the ability to govern will not be able to succeed, regardless of how much he tries or how many resources he has at his disposal. The story emphasizes the importance of competence and ability in leadership, and suggests that a leader who lacks these qualities will ultimately fail.
(3) The concept of the "incompetent king" in the story is similar to the idea of the "tyrant" in Western thought, where a ruler who is seen as abusive or ineffective will face opposition from their subjects. However, the story goes beyond this idea by emphasizing the role of competence and ability in leadership, and suggesting that a leader who lacks these qualities will ultimately be unable to succeed, regardless of their power or resources. The story also touches on the idea of the "mandate of heaven," which is a common concept in Chinese thought, where a ruler who is seen as being appointed by the gods or the heavens will be given the authority to rule. In this story, the incompetence of the king is seen as a sign that he has lost the mandate of heaven, and that his rule is no longer justified.</s>
