《Zhang Shi and Feng Xuan Biography》  
Zhang Shi, a native of Zhuoyang, was known as Zhi. He had an elder brother named Zhong Tong. He served as a mounted attendant for Emperor Wen of Han, but at the age of ten, he was unable to secure a position and remained unknown. Zhang Shi said, "Long service diminishes the family's wealth and does not fulfill one's aspirations." He wished to return home. Yuan Jun, the commander-in-chief, recognized his talent and persuaded him to take a position as a messenger. After Zhang Shi completed his duties, he spoke of matters of state. Emperor Wen said, "Lower your voice, do not speak too lofty, so that it can be implemented now." Zhang Shi then spoke of the differences between the Qin and Han dynasties, explaining why the Qin fell and the Han rose. The emperor praised him and appointed him as a messenger deputy.  

Zhang Shi followed the emperor and climbed the Tiger's Den. The emperor asked the chief keeper of the imperial park about the animals and birds. After many questions, the keeper could not answer. The keeper's assistant, who was skilled in animal husbandry, answered all the emperor's questions. The emperor then ordered Zhang Shi to appoint the assistant as the chief keeper of the imperial park. Zhang Shi asked, "Emperor Wen, how do you regard Zhou Bo, the Marquis of Zhuo?" The emperor replied, "He is a wise man." He then asked, "How about Zhang Liang, the Marquis of Dongyang?" The emperor again said, "He is a wise man." Zhang Shi said, "The Marquises of Zhuo and Dongyang are called wise men because they could not speak their minds. How can this assistant be a skilled speaker?" He also criticized the Qin dynasty for relying on harsh officials who only wrote formal documents without genuine concern. The emperor then appointed the assistant as the chief keeper.  

Later, Zhang Shi was appointed as the chief of the imperial carriages. When the emperor traveled to the tomb of Emperor Wen, he pointed to a path and said, "This is the route to Handan." He then had the emperor's concubine play the zither. The emperor leaned on the zither and sang, expressing sorrow and longing. He then asked the court officials, "How can this path be disturbed?" The officials agreed. Zhang Shi then said, "If there is something desirable, even the mountains of Shanxi would have a gap. If there is nothing desirable, even without stone barriers, why worry?" The emperor praised him. Later, Zhang Shi was appointed as the chief justice.  

One day, the emperor was traveling through the Middle Weicheng Bridge when a man emerged from the bridge. The emperor's horse became frightened. The emperor ordered the man to be captured and brought to the chief justice. Zhang Shi investigated the case. He said, "The man is from the county. He heard the sound and hid under the bridge. After a long time, he thought the emperor had passed and emerged, only to see the imperial carriage." The chief justice of Qin would have punished him with a fine. The emperor was angry, saying, "This man frightened my horse. My horse is gentle, so it would not harm other horses. Yet the chief justice punishes him with a fine?" Zhang Shi replied, "The law is a public law for the people. If the law is changed, it will lose the people's trust. If the law is not changed, the people will not know where to place their hands and feet. Only the emperor should examine this." The emperor agreed.  

Later, a man stole a jade ring from the altar of the emperor's ancestors. The emperor ordered the chief justice to investigate. Zhang Shi argued that the thief should be executed. The emperor was furious, saying, "This man is disrespectful to the emperor's ancestors. The chief justice should execute him." Zhang Shi said, "The law is sufficient. The crime is equal, but the punishment should depend on the order of the crime. If a thief steals a jade ring, it is like a thousandth of a crime. If a commoner takes a handful of earth from the emperor's tomb, how can the emperor increase the punishment?" The emperor and the empress discussed this and agreed with Zhang Shi. At this time, the chief justice of Zhou and the minister of the Han, Gao Shun and Wang Ting, became friends with Zhang Shi. Zhang Shi became famous throughout the world.  

Later, when Emperor Wen died and Emperor Jing ascended the throne, Zhang Shi feared for his life. He claimed illness and wanted to avoid punishment. He wanted to apologize but did not know how. He used the advice of Wang Sheng, a scholar who practiced Daoism. Wang Sheng invited him to the court, and all the officials stood in line. Wang Sheng, an old man, said, "I tie the knot." He then told Zhang Shi, "Tie the knot for me." Zhang Shi knelt and tied the knot. Later, people said Wang Sheng had insulted Zhang Shi by making him kneel. Wang Sheng replied, "I am old and poor. I do not think I can benefit Zhang Shi. Zhang Shi is a famous official in the world. I am just here to humiliate him and make him kneel, hoping to make him more respected." The officials praised Wang Sheng and respected Zhang Shi.  

Zhang Shi served Emperor Jing for over a year as the prime minister of the Prince of Huainan. Later, he died. His son, Zhang Zhong, was appointed as a doctor but was not promoted. He could not gain favor in the world, so he never held an official position.  

Feng Xuan, the great-grandson of Zhao, was born in the Zhao state. His father was transferred to the state of Dai. Feng Xuan was known for his filial piety. He served as a deputy in the imperial court for Emperor Wen. When the emperor passed through the state of Dai, he asked Feng Xuan about his father's occupation. Feng Xuan explained that his father was a messenger. The emperor then asked about his father's home. Feng Xuan answered truthfully. The emperor said, "When I was in the state of Dai, I had a servant named Li Qi who often spoke of Zhao's general Li Qi. Now, I think of him every time I eat. Did my father know this?" Feng Xuan replied, "Your father was a general, and Li Qi was a wise general. Your father knew this." The emperor said, "Why?" Feng Xuan replied, "Your father was a general, and Li Qi was a wise general. Your father knew this." The emperor said, "I have never had a general like Li Qi." Feng Xuan said, "Your Majesty has generals like Li Qi and Zhao Ting, but you cannot use them." The emperor became angry and left the court. Later, he summoned Feng Xuan and asked, "Why did you embarrass me?" Feng Xuan said, "I do not know the customs."  

At this time, the Xiongnu had recently invaded the northern territories. They killed the commander of the northern garrison, Yan. The emperor took this as a threat and asked Feng Xuan again, "How do you know I cannot use generals like Li Qi and Zhao Ting?" Feng Xuan said, "I have heard that in ancient times, kings appointed generals by kneeling and pushing the reins. The generals controlled the interior, and the king controlled the exterior. Military rewards and punishments were decided by the generals. This is not a lie. Your father said that Li Qi was a general in Zhao, and he controlled the military market. Rewards and punishments were decided by the generals, not the king. If the king controls the rewards and punishments, the generals will not be able to use their abilities. If the king controls the rewards and punishments, the generals will not be able to use their abilities. If the king controls the rewards and punishments, the generals will not be able to use their abilities."  

Feng Xuan also said, "If the emperor controls the rewards and punishments, the generals will not be able to use their abilities. If the emperor controls the rewards and punishments, the generals will not be able to use their abilities. If the emperor controls the rewards and punishments, the generals will not be able to use their abilities." The emperor said, "I have heard of Li Qi and Zhao Ting. I am not afraid of the Xiongnu." Feng Xuan said, "Your Majesty has generals like Li Qi and Zhao Ting, but you cannot use them." The emperor became angry and left the court. Later, he summoned Feng Xuan and said, "Why did you embarrass me?" Feng Xuan said, "I do not know the customs."

When Emperor Jing ascended the throne, he appointed Feng Xuan as the prime minister of the Prince of Huainan. Later, he was dismissed. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne, he sought talented officials and appointed Feng Xuan. Feng Xuan was already over ninety years old and could not hold an office. He appointed his son, Feng Shui, as a messenger. Feng Shui was also a remarkable man and became friends with the author.  

The Grand Historian said: Zhang Zhi's words were those of a wise man, upholding the law without bending to the emperor's will. Feng Xuan's words on generals were profound. As the saying goes, "Do not judge a person by their friends." Zhang Zhi and Feng Xuan are near these ideals. The saying "Not partial, not biased, the way is broad and smooth; not biased, not partial, the way is smooth and easy" applies to them. Zhang Zhi and Feng Xuan are near these ideals. [end of text]
