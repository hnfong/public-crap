问题：历史中的秦始皇有甚么家人？他的童年过得开心吗？

A great question about one of the most fascinating figures in Chinese history! 😊

秦始皇 (Qín Shǐ Huáng), also known as Ying Zheng, was the founder of the Qin dynasty and the first emperor of a unified China. While there are many legends and stories about his life, the historical records of his personal life and family are limited. However, based on available sources, here's what we know:

**Family:**

* Father: Lu Buwei (呂不韋), a merchant and politician who later became the Chancellor of Qin.
* Mother: Lady Zhao (趙姬), a concubine of Lu Buwei.
* Half-brothers: There were several half-brothers, but their names are not well-documented.

**Childhood:**

* According to the Records of the Grand Historian (史記) by Sima Qian, Ying Zheng was born in 259 BCE in Handan, the capital of Zhao State (now in Hebei Province).
* His early life was marked by turmoil and instability. His father, Lu Buwei, was a prominent figure in the state of Qin, and Ying Zheng was raised in a tumultuous environment.
* There are few records of his childhood, but it's said that he was intelligent and ambitious from a young age.

**Upbringing:**

* Ying Zheng was educated in the classics, literature, and martial arts, which prepared him for his future role as a ruler.
* He was also known for his cunning and strategic thinking, which helped him navigate the complex web of alliances and rivalries among the warring states.

While we can't say for certain whether Ying Zheng's childhood was "happy" or not, it's clear that his early life was shaped by the political turmoil of the time. His experiences likely influenced his later decisions and actions as the emperor of Qin.

It's worth noting that the historical records of Qin Shi Huang's life are often biased or incomplete, and many stories about his personal life are based on legend or speculation. Nevertheless, his legacy as a unifier and a visionary leader has endured for centuries, shaping the course of Chinese history.
