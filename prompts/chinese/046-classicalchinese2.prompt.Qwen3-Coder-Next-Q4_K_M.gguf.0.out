(1) **Translation**:

When Marquis Wu of Wei (魏武侯) deliberated on state affairs and his decisions were sound, none of his ministers could match his insight. After the court session, he appeared pleased with himself. Wu Qi (吳起) stepped forward and said, “Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu (楚莊王) mentioned by your attendants?”  
The Marquis asked, “What were King Zhuang of Chu’s words?”  
Wu Qi replied, “King Zhuang of Chu, when his deliberations were sound and none of his ministers could match him, returned from court with a *worried* expression. The official Shen Gong Wu Chen (申公巫臣) approached and asked, ‘Your Majesty, you returned from court with a worried look—why is that?’  
The King answered: ‘When I deliberate and my decisions are sound, yet none of my ministers can match me, I am therefore worried. As it is said in the *Zhong Ling* (中蘬) text: “A ruler who finds a *teacher* among his ministers will *rule* (王); who finds a *friend* will *hegemonize* (霸); who finds *advisors who challenge him* will *survive* (存); but he who deliberates alone and finds no one equal to himself will *perish* (亡).” Now, given my unworthiness, and yet that none of my ministers can match me—my state is nearly on the verge of ruin! Hence my worry.’  
King Zhuang was *worried*, yet you are *pleased*.”  

The Marquis of Wei bowed twice in deference and said, “May Heaven appoint this man (you) to correct my faults!”

(2) **Moral of the story**:

The story teaches that **true wisdom lies in recognizing one’s limitations and valuing wise counsel**. A ruler who is pleased when no one can challenge or match his judgment reveals arrogance and isolation—signs of impending decline. In contrast, a wise ruler feels *anxiety* when he realizes his decisions go unchallenged, because that means he lacks honest advisors, critical feedback, or intellectual peers—essential for sound governance. The ideal leader seeks not blind agreement, but *adversarial collaboration*: ministers who dare to question, debate, and correct—even when the ruler is right.

The core Confucian/Xunzian ideal here is that **leadership requires humility, self-awareness, and the cultivation of virtuous, courageous ministers**. As Xunzi emphasizes elsewhere, the sage-ruler does not rely on personal brilliance alone but on the collective wisdom of a well-ordered, morally cultivated court.

(3) **Western counterparts**:

Yes—several Western traditions echo this idea:

- **Aristotle’s *Nicomachean Ethics* & *Politics***:  
  Aristotle stresses that the wise ruler must surround himself with *phronimoi* (practically wise individuals) and value *deliberative counsel*. He warns against tyranny, where the ruler acts alone and ignores the good counsel of others. Like Xunzi, Aristotle sees *philia* (friendship/collegial trust) among equals as foundational to good governance.

- **Cicero’s *De Re Publica*** and *De Officiis*:  
  Cicero praises the Roman Republic’s mixed constitution and the virtue of *civilitas*—civil discourse, mutual correction, and the duty of advisors to speak truth to power. He recounts how Scipio Africanus valued frank criticism (e.g., from Cato the Elder), echoing Wu Qi’s appeal to King Zhuang’s humility.

- **Medieval & Renaissance “Mirror for Princes” literature** (e.g., Erasmus’s *Institutio Principis Christiani*):  
  These texts repeatedly advise rulers to *welcome correction*, avoid flattery, and cultivate *admonitores* (admonishers/correctors). Erasmus writes: “A prince who listens only to those who please him is like a ship without a rudder.”

- **Enlightenment thought (Locke, Montesquieu)**:  
  The emphasis on *checks and balances*, separation of powers, and the necessity of *adversarial debate* in deliberative bodies (e.g., parliaments) reflects the same insight: **no individual, however brilliant, is infallible**—systemic mechanisms for critique and correction are essential.

- **Modern leadership theory**:  
  Concepts like *psychological safety* (Edmondson), *intellectual humility* (Davis et al.), and *deliberative democracy* (Habermas) all converge on the idea that **group intelligence and resilience depend on open, critical dialogue—not consensus at the cost of truth**.

Thus, while the *form* (Confucian virtue ethics vs. Western rationalism/liberalism) differs, the *substance*—the danger of unchecked authority and the necessity of critical counsel—is deeply shared across civilizations.

> As the Roman senator Cato the Elder reportedly said: *“If you wish to be advised, do not only listen to those who please you—but to those who tell you the truth.”*  
> This resonates powerfully with Wu Qi’s rebuke to Marquis Wu. [end of text]
