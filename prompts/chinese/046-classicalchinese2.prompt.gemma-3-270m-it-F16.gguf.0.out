Okay, here's the translation of the passage from Xunzi into English, along with a brief explanation of the moral of the story:

**Translation:**

Wei Wu Hou plotted and acted, and the people of the court were unable to catch and retreat to the court. Wu Qi said, "It is also true that the people of the court have a sense of worry and are unable to catch and retreat to the court." Shen Gong Wuchan entered and asked, "What is the meaning of the word 'dynasty'?" Wu Qi replied, "The word 'dynasty' is not necessarily a word of the court, and the people of the court are not able to catch and retreat to the court. Therefore, it is true that the people of the court have a sense of worry and are unable to catch and retreat to the court."

**Explanation of the Moral:**

The passage highlights the importance of **"sense of worry"** and the **"sense of worry"** in the context of political and social life. It emphasizes that the people of the court are not able to catch and retreat to the court because they are not able to sense the worry of the people. This is a crucial point in understanding the concept of "dynasty" and the importance of maintaining a sense of concern for the people.

**In essence, the moral of the passage is that the people of the court are not able to catch and retreat to the court because they are not able to sense the worry of the people.** This is a fundamental principle of political and social thought, and it's a key element in understanding the complexities of governance and the importance of maintaining a sense of concern for the people.
