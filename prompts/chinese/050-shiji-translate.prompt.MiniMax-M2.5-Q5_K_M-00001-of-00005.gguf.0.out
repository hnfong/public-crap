The Biography of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang

Zhang Shizhi, the Minister of Justice, was from Duyang, with the style name Ji. He had an older brother named Zhong, with whom he lived. He became a cavalry officer through purchase and served Emperor Wen. For ten years he was not promoted and remained unknown. Shizhi said, "If I continue in office long, I will diminish my brother Zhong's property without achieving anything." He wished to resign and return home. Yuan Ang, the General of the Gentlemen of the Household, knew of his ability and was reluctant to see him leave, so he requested that Shizhi be transferred to fill the post of Attendant. When Shizhi had finished paying his respects at court, he presented matters of policy. Emperor Wen said, "Keep your proposals practical, not overly theoretical; let them be implementable now." Thereupon Shizhi spoke at length about the affairs of Qin and the period between Qin and Han, explaining how Qin had failed and how Han had risen. Emperor Wen praised him and appointed him as Attendant Officer.

Shizhi accompanied the emperor on an excursion to the tiger enclosure. The emperor asked the Keeper of the Imperial Park about the register of various birds and beasts. More than ten questions were asked, but the Keeper looked left and right and could not answer. A stableman from the tiger enclosure then stepped forward and answered the emperor's questions about the register of birds and beasts in great detail, seeking to display his ability to respond readily and without end. The emperor said, "Should an official not be like this? The Keeper is worthless!" He then ordered Shizhi to appoint the stableman as Chief of the Imperial Park. Shizhi went forward and said, "What do you think of Zhou Bo, the Marquis of Jiang?" The emperor said, "A venerable man." He asked again, "What about Zhang Xiang, the Marquis of Dongyang?" The emperor again said, "A venerable man." Shizhi said, "When the Marquis of Jiang and the Marquis of Dongyang are called venerable men, these two men, when speaking on matters, cannot even get words out of their mouths. How could they emulate this stableman's glib and quick-witted talk! Moreover, Qin employed officials who were penmen, and the officials vied with each other in being swift and sharp in examination. But their only fault was superficial paperwork, without any real compassion. As a result, their faults were not heard, and decline continued until the second generation, and the world collapsed. Now Your Majesty promotes a stableman because of his eloquence; I fear that the world will follow suit, vying in eloquence without substance. Moreover, the transformation of those below by those above is faster than shadow and echo; in making appointments and dismissals, you must be careful." Emperor Wen said, "Good." He then stopped and did not appoint the stableman.

The emperor got into his carriage, summoned Shizhi to ride alongside, and while traveling slowly, asked Shizhi about the faults of Qin. He answered frankly. When they reached the palace, the emperor appointed Shizhi as Officer of the Palace Gate.

Soon after, the Crown Prince and the Prince of Liang rode in the same carriage to court and did not dismount at the司马 gate. Shizhi then stopped them and prevented the Crown Prince and Prince of Liang from entering the palace gate. He then impeached them for not dismounting at the palace gate, for lack of respect, and presented a memorial. When the Empress Dowager heard of this, Emperor Wen removed his cap and apologized, saying, "I was careless in teaching my son." The Empress Dowager then sent a messenger with an imperial edict to pardon the Crown Prince and Prince of Liang, after which they were allowed to enter. Emperor Wen thereupon regarded Shizhi as unusual and appointed him as a Chamberlain.

Soon after, he became a General of the Gentlemen of the Household. When accompanying the emperor to Baling, he resided on the north side, near the latrine. At that time, Lady Shen was following the emperor. The emperor pointed to the new road to Xinfeng and said, "This leads to the road to Handan." He had Lady Shen play the se, and the emperor leaned on the se and sang, his expression sad and grieved. He turned to the ministers and said, "Alas! To use stone from the northern mountain for a coffin, with silk floss and raw silk laid in between and lacquer applied—could it ever be moved!" All those around said, "Good." Shizhi went forward and said, "If there were something desirable within, even sealing the southern mountain would still leave a gap; if there were nothing desirable within, even without a stone coffin, what would there to grieve about!" Emperor Wen praised him. Later, he appointed Shizhi as Minister of Justice.

Soon after, the emperor passed through the central bridge over the Wei River. A man emerged from beneath the bridge, causing the imperial carriage's horses to be startled. The emperor had the rider seize the man and hand him over to the Minister of Justice. Shizhi interrogated him. The man said, "I am from the county; hearing the royal procession, I hid under the bridge. After a long time, I thought the procession had passed, so I came out. When I saw the imperial carriage and cavalry, I ran." The Minister of Justice Qin judged that a person violating the royal procession should be fined. Emperor Wen was angry and said, "This person personally startled my horses; my horses were fortunate to be gentle—if it had been another horse, wouldn't it have certainly injured me? And the Minister of Justice would only fine him!" Shizhi said, "The law is something the emperor and the world share. If the law says this and you change it to something heavier, then the law will not be trusted by the people. Moreover, at that time, if you had had him executed on the spot, that would have been the end of it. Now that you have handed him over to the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Justice is the balance of the world; if it tilts, then the laws of the world will all be applied with partiality—where can the people place their hands and feet? I hope Your Majesty will consider this." After a long while, Emperor Wen said, "The Minister of Justice's judgment is correct."

Later, someone stole a jade ring from in front of the altar of Gaozu. The thief was caught, and Emperor Wen was angry. He handed the case to the Minister of Justice for investigation. Shizhi examined the law and presented a memorial stating that one who steals items from the imperial ancestral temple should be sentenced to public execution. Emperor Wen was greatly angry and said, "This person's wickedness is extreme—he steals implements from the former emperor's temple. I am handing him over to the Minister of Justice because I want to execute his entire clan, but you judge him according to the law—this is not my intention in honoring the ancestral temple." Shizhi removed his cap, kowtowed, and apologized, saying, "The law is sufficient as it is. Moreover, the crimes are equal, but the degree of punishment differs according to the circumstances. Now if one steals implements from the imperial temple and the entire clan is executed, what if, at most one in ten thousand cases, a foolish person takes a handful of earth from the Changling tomb—how would Your Majesty increase the punishment?" After a long time, Emperor Wen discussed it with the Empress Dowager, and then agreed to the Minister of Justice's judgment. At that time, Zhou Yafu, the Marquis of Tiaohou, the General of the Center, and Wang Tiankai, the Marquis of Shandu, saw that Shizhi's judgments were fair, and they became close friends. From this, Zhang Shizhi was praised throughout the world.

Later, Emperor Wen died, and Emperor Jing ascended the throne. Shizhi was afraid and claimed illness. He wished to resign and leave, fearing that a major punishment would come; he wished to meet and apologize, but did not know what would happen. Using a plan from Wang Sheng, he finally met and apologized, and Emperor Jing did not blame him.

Wang Sheng was a good speaker of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, and was a hermit. He was once summoned to live in the court, and when all the high ministers and nine ranks of officials were assembled, Wang Sheng, an old man, said, "My socks are untied," and turning to Zhang Shizhi, said, "Tie my socks for me!" Shizhi knelt and tied them. Afterwards, someone said to Wang Sheng, "How could you humiliate Zhang Shizhi in front of the court, making him kneel to tie your socks?" Wang Sheng said, "I am old and of low status; I have considered that I cannot ultimately benefit Zhang Shizhi. Zhang Shizhi is now a famous minister under heaven. I purposely humiliated him in a small matter, making him kneel to tie my socks, because I wish to honor him." When the ministers heard this, they respected Wang Sheng and valued Zhang Shizhi even more.

Zhang Shizhi served Emperor Jing for more than a year as Prime Minister of the King of Huainan, still because of past faults. After a long time, Shizhi died. His son was named Zhang Zhi, with the style name Changgong, who reached the rank of Grand Master but was dismissed. Because he could not win favor with the people of his time, he never held office in his life.

Feng Tang's grandfather was from Zhao. His father moved to Dai. When the Han dynasty was established, they moved to Anling. Feng Tang, known for his filial piety, served as the Chief of the Gentlemen of the Palace and attended to Emperor Wen. When Emperor Wen passed by in a carriage, he asked Tang, "Why does an old man become an official? Where is your home?" Tang answered truthfully. Emperor Wen said, "When I was in Dai, the official in charge of food, Gao Qu, repeatedly told me about the ability of the Zhao general Li Qi, and the battle at Julu. Now every time I eat, my thoughts are always at Julu. Do you know this?" Tang replied, "He is still not as good as Lian Po and Li Mu as generals." The emperor asked, "Why?" Tang said, "My grandfather was in Zhao and served as a commander, and was close to Li Mu. My father was also a prime minister of Dai and was close to the Zhao general Li Qi, knowing his character." When the emperor heard about Lian Po and Li Mu, he was pleased, and slapping his thigh, said, "Alas! I alone do not have Lian Po or Li Mu as my generals at this time—would I worry about the Xiongnu?" Tang said, "Your subject! Even if Your Majesty had Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them." The emperor became angry, rose, and entered the inner palace. After a long time, he summoned Tang and reproached him, "Why did you humiliate me in front of everyone? Is there no private place?" Tang apologized, saying, "I am a vulgar person and do not know what to avoid."

At that time, the Xiongnu had newly invaded heavily, killing the都尉 of Beidi. The emperor, concerned about the barbarian invasion, finally asked Tang again, "How do you know I cannot use Lian Po and Li Mu?" Tang replied, "I have heard that when ancient kings sent out their generals, they knelt and pushed the carriage wheel, saying, 'Within the gate, I control it; outside the gate, the general controls it.' Military rewards and titles are all decided externally and then reported. This is not an empty statement. My grandfather said that Li Mu, as a Zhao general stationed at the border, used the market taxes of the army all for the soldiers' food, and rewards were decided externally without interference from the center. He was entrusted with the task and required to achieve results, so Li Mu could fully use his abilities—selecting thirteen hundred chariots, thirteen thousand armored cavalry, and a hundred thousand soldiers of high merit. As a result, he drove out the Chanyu in the north, destroyed the Donghu, eliminated the Danlin, suppressed the powerful Qin in the west, and supported Han and Wei in the south. At that time, Zhao was almost hegemon. Later, when King Zhao of Zhao ascended the throne, his mother was a singer. When King Zhao took the throne, he listened to the slander of Guo Kai and finally executed Li Mu, replacing him with Yan Ju. Thus the army was defeated and the soldiers fled, and they were captured and destroyed by Qin. Now I have heard that Wei Shang is the prefect of Yunzhong, and the market taxes of his army are all used to feed the soldiers, and he uses personal funds to buy cattle once every five days to feast guests, officers, and staff. As a result, the Xiongnu keep far away and do not approach the passes of Yunzhong. When the enemy once invaded, Shang led chariots and cavalry to attack and killed many of them. The soldiers are all commoners' sons, who rise from the fields to join the army and know nothing of military records or registers. They fight hard all day, beheading enemies and capturing prisoners, and when they report their achievements to the headquarters, if a single word does not match, the civil officials punish them according to the law. Their rewards are not given, but the officials strictly enforce the law. I am foolish, but I think Your Majesty's laws are too strict, rewards too light, and punishments too heavy. Moreover, Prefect Wei Shang was charged with having six ranks fewer than the number of enemy heads he reported, and Your Majesty's officials reduced his rank and imposed corporal punishment. Given this, even if Your Majesty had Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them. I am truly foolish and have touched on forbidden topics—I deserve death many times over!" Emperor Wen was pleased. That day, he ordered Feng Tang to carry a token to pardon Wei Shang and restore him as Prefect of Yunzhong, and appointed Tang as Commandant of Cavalry, in charge of the central army and the troops of the commanderies and kingdoms.

In the seventh year, Emperor Jing ascended the throne, appointed Tang as Prime Minister of Chu, and dismissed him. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne, he sought worthy and good men and recommended Feng Tang. Tang was then over ninety years old and could not serve as an official again, so his son Feng Sui was made a gentleman. Sui, with the style name Wangsun, was also an extraordinary man, and was close to me.

The Grand Historian says: Zhang Ji spoke of venerable men, upholding the law without yielding to personal wishes; Feng Tang's discourse on generals is flavorful, truly flavorful! As the saying goes, "If you do not know a person, look at his friends." The praises of these two gentlemen can be recorded in the great hall of government. The Book says, "Without partiality, without favoritism, the king's way is broad; without favoritism, without partiality, the king's way is smooth." Zhang Ji and Feng Tang come close to this.
