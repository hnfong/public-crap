Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to understand the story from the text provided. The passage is about Westmen Baofu, who was the magistrate of the city of Ai during the reign of Wei Wenhou. The main issue he dealt with was the ritual of offering a girl to the River God (Hebi) as part of a local tradition. The people were suffering because the local officials, including the three elders and the officials, were taking money from the people to pay for this ritual, which involved selecting a girl, dressing her up, and then throwing her into the river. This practice led to many girls being taken away and people fleeing, causing the city to become empty and poor.

Now, for Q1: A short summary. I need to capture the key points. Westmen Baofu discovered the corrupt practice of offering girls to the River God, which was causing harm. He organized a fake ritual, throwing the old priestess and her disciples into the river, then the three elders, and finally the officials. This made the people fear the practice, so they stopped it. Then he implemented irrigation projects, which improved the city's agriculture and prosperity.

Q2: What kind of women were usually the victims? The text mentions that the old priestess was a "老女子" (old woman), and the others were her "弟子" (disciples). So the victims were young girls, specifically those from the local families, but the ones chosen were likely the daughters of the poor or those who were not wanted. The priestess was an older woman, but she was the one who was selected to be the bride for the River God, so maybe the victims were young girls, and the priestess was the one who was forced to be the bride, but the text says the priestess was already 70 years old. Wait, the text says the old priestess was 70, and she was the one who was selected. But the people were afraid of the priestess taking their daughters, so the victims were the young girls from the families. But the question is about the kind of women usually the victims. The answer is young girls, possibly from poor families, as they were the ones being taken away.

Q3: Who benefits from the old practice? The three elders, the officials (廷掾), and the priestess (巫祝) and their disciples. They were taking the money from the people, using it for their own purposes, like the priestess and her disciples getting money from the people, and the three elders and officials were also involved in the process. So the beneficiaries are the local officials, the priestess, and her disciples, as they were getting the money and not using it for the community's benefit.

Q4: Did the protagonist use wits or force? The story says he used force. He organized a fake ritual, threw the priestess and her disciples into the river, then the three elders, and finally the officials. He didn't just talk about it; he took action by physically removing the people responsible. So it's force, not just using clever words. But maybe there's a clever aspect in how he exposed the corruption by making a spectacle of it. However, the main method was forceful action, so the answer is force.

Q5: Was it moral? From different perspectives: From the people's perspective, it's moral because he stopped a harmful tradition that was causing suffering. From the officials' perspective, maybe not, since he used force against them. From a Confucian perspective, maybe it's seen as a way to correct corruption, but using force might be seen as harsh. From a legal standpoint, he was enforcing the law by stopping the ritual, which was illegal. From a moral standpoint, he was acting in the best interest of the people, even if it involved violence. But some might argue that using force is not the right way, but in this case, it was necessary to stop the practice.

Q6: The comment at the end says that three men (ZiChan, ZiJian, and Ximen Baofu) are known for their different approaches: ZiChan's people couldn't be deceived, ZiJian's people couldn't be tricked, and Ximen Baofu's people couldn't be bullied. The question is whether the comment is fair. The text says that Ximen Baofu's people were afraid of him, so he made them not dare to do anything. ZiChan's people were honest, and ZiJian's people were kind. So the comment is comparing their methods. The author might think that Ximen Baofu is the most virtuous because he used force to stop the corruption, but others might argue that ZiChan and ZiJian were more ethical. The fairness depends on the values of the time. In Confucian terms, maybe Ximen Baofu is considered the most virtuous because he corrected the corruption through decisive action, even if it was harsh. But others might see it as a different approach. The comment is fair in that it highlights the different methods, but the evaluation of who is the most virtuous is subjective.

**Q1:** Westmen Baofu, as the magistrate of Ai, exposed the corrupt ritual of offering girls to the River God (Hebi) by falsely accusing the priestess and officials of being "bad" and throwing them into the river, making the people fear the practice. He later implemented irrigation projects, improving agriculture and the city's prosperity.  

**Q2:** The victims were young girls, often from poor families, who were forced to be sacrificed to the River God.  

**Q3:** The three elders, the priestess (巫祝) and her disciples, and the local officials (廷掾) benefited from the practice by collecting money and avoiding responsibility for the people's suffering.  

**Q4:** Westmen Baofu used **force**. He orchestrated a public spectacle by throwing the priestess, her disciples, and the officials into the river, leveraging fear and authority to end the ritual. While his actions were clever in exposing corruption, the primary method was physical coercion.  

**Q5:**  
- **People’s perspective:** Moral, as he stopped a harmful tradition that caused poverty and fear.  
- **Officials’ perspective:** Unmoral, as he used violence against those in power.  
- **Confucian view:** Ethical, as he corrected corruption through decisive action, though force might be seen as harsh.  
- **Legal perspective:** Just, as he enforced laws against the ritual.  
- **Moral dilemma:** While his intent was good, the means (force) raised questions about fairness.  

**Q6:** The comment compares three rulers: ZiChan (ZiChan of Zheng) who made people honest, ZiJian (ZiJian of Shandong) who made people compassionate, and Ximen Baofu who made people afraid. It suggests Ximen Baofu’s method (using force to stop corruption) was effective but harsh. The comment is **fair** in highlighting their distinct approaches, but whether he is the "most virtuous" depends on values. Confucian ideals might favor ZiChan or ZiJian for their ethical restraint, while Ximen Baofu’s actions reflect pragmatism in addressing corruption, making his method controversial yet effective.
