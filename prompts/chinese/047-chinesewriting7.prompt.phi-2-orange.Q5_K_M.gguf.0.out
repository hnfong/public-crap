In the spring, the sunflower's petals bloomed,
Turning their faces towards the sun,
But as the days passed, they grew old,
And their vibrant colors began to fade.

The once-tall stalks started to droop,
Their leaves turned yellow and brittle,
The sunflower's heart, once full of life,
Now lay hidden beneath its withered skin.

The wind whispered secrets to the flowers,
As they danced in the soft breeze,
But the sunflower knew its time had come,
To bid farewell to the world with grace.

As the sun set on the horizon,
The sunflower's petals fell to the ground,
A single tear trickled down its face,
A silent farewell to the sun.

In the quiet of the night,
The sunflower's spirit took flight,
It soared above the clouds,
A beacon of love and light.

And as the seasons changed,
The sunflower's memory remained,
A testament to the beauty of life,
And the fleeting nature of time.

So let us remember the sunflower,
And the lessons it taught us,
That even in our darkest days,
There is always hope and love.

For the sunflower's spirit lives on,
In the hearts of those who remember,
And in the beauty of the world around us,
That never ceases to amaze.
