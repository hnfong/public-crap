<s> USER: This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

ASSISTANT: 1) Translation into English:

When Wei Wu was planning to do something and was about to act, the ministers could not grasp his intentions. After leaving the court, he had a look of joy on his face. When Wu Qi saw this, he asked, "Have you also heard the words of the King of Tongzhou? He said that when the King of Tongzhou was planning to do something, the ministers could not catch his intentions, and when he left the court, he had a look of sorrow. Apilu, the minister, went forward to question him, saying, 'Your Majesty's face shows sorrow; what is the cause?' The King of Tongzhou replied, 'It is because my plans are not secure; the ministers could not grasp them, and thus I am sorrowful. According to what Zi You, the Minister Duan, said, "Heavenly sovereigns gain generals by winning, friends by being amicable, and doubts by being ambiguous; they plan and yet do not appear to be the most capable, and thus they lose." Now, with my plans not succeeding and the ministers not grasping them, my country is close to ruin. That is why I am sorrowful.' The King of Tongzhou was sorrowful, while the ruler was joyful. Later, when Wu Qi saw this again during his tour of inspection, he knelt down to admonish the ruler, saying, 'Heaven has entrusted you with the task of correcting my petty ambitions.'"

2) Moral of the story:

The moral of the story is that effective leadership requires clear and decisive planning. The King of Tongzhou's plans were so subtle and well-concealed that even his own ministers could not understand them. While this might seem like a virtue, as it avoids predictability and potential sabotage, it also has a significant downside. The king's lack of transparency led to uncertainty and ultimately to a sense of sorrow and impending doom because the people around him could not support or contribute to his plans effectively. In contrast, Wu Qi's ability to execute his plans with clarity and effectiveness, as demonstrated by the joy on his face after his successful deception, illustrates the value of clear leadership. The story suggests that while subtlety can have its place, clarity and the ability to convey and implement one's intentions are crucial for a leader's success.

3) Counterpart in Western thought:

The concepts in this story have a counterpart in Western thought, particularly in the realpolitik writings of Niccolò Machiavelli. Machiavelli's "The Prince" discusses the art of ruling and the qualities of a successful ruler. He emphasizes the importance of appearing strong, decisive, and unpredictable while also maintaining the loyalty and support of one's subjects and allies. Machiavelli's famous dictum, "It is better to be feared than loved, if you cannot both," resonates with the Taoist-Confucian dynamics in the story. Both texts highlight the challenges of leading through subtlety and the importance of clear, decisive action. Additionally, the concept of the "veiled lieutenant" in Sun Tzu's "The Art of War" also echoes the idea of a leader who is enigmatic and difficult to read, which can be advantageous in strategic planning.

In European thought, the concept of the "wise sovereign" who can plan effectively, maintain the loyalty of their advisors, and execute their plans without being too predictable or transparent is a recurring theme in political philosophy and strategy, akin to the King of Tongzhou's situation. However, unlike the King of Tongzhou, who ultimately faces ruin due to his lack of transparency, the ideal in Western thought often leans towards a balance between wisdom, strength, and the ability to inspire trust and loyalty in one's subjects and advisors.</s>
