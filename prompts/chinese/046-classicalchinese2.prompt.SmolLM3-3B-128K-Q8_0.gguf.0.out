(1) Translation:

魏武侯 (Wu Huang) was planning a strategy that no one else could match, and when he returned from the meeting, he had a joyful expression. Wu Yi (Yi) said, "Have you ever heard the words of Chu's King Zhuang?" Wu Huang replied, "What were the words of Chu's King Zhuang?" Yi said, "Chu's King Zhuang planned a strategy that no one else could match, and when he returned from the meeting, he had a worried expression. Shang Guan and Xunzi asked him, 'Why do you have a worried expression when you return from the meeting?' King Zhuang said, 'I am worried because my strategy is not good, and no one else can match it. It is like the saying: "If a ruler can find a good teacher, a good friend, and a wise advisor, he will be safe. If he can't find them, he will be in danger." Now, because I am not good enough, and no one else can match me, our country is almost in danger. That's why I'm worried.' King Zhuang was worried, but you are joyful." Wu Huang was surprised and bowed again and again, saying, "The Master has forgiven my mistakes."

(2) Moral of the story:

The story emphasizes the importance of humility and self-awareness in leadership. It highlights that even if a leader has a good strategy, if they are not aware of their own shortcomings and the potential for others to surpass them, they may face anxiety and worry. Conversely, if a leader is humble and recognizes their own limitations, they can maintain a positive and hopeful attitude, even in challenging situations.

(3) Counterpart in Western thought:

The concept of humility and self-awareness in leadership is a common theme in Western thought as well. Philosophers like Aristotle and Cicero emphasized the importance of self-knowledge and humility in leadership. The idea that a leader should be aware of their own limitations and seek the guidance of others is also present in Western thought, particularly in the concept of "servant leadership" and the idea of "servant statesmen" as advocated by thinkers like John Locke and Thomas Jefferson. The story also resonates with the idea of "the fallibility of the wise" and the importance of humility in leadership, which is a common theme in Western political philosophy. [end of text]
