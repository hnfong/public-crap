### Translation

The story is from "Xunzi," a classical Chinese text. Here is the translation:

The Marquis of Wei was deliberating on a matter and found the right solution, while his ministers could not match his insight. After the court session, he displayed a joyful expression. Wu Qi approached and asked, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu from your attendants?" The Marquis of Wei inquired, "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?" Wu Qi replied, "When King Zhuang of Chu deliberated on a matter and found the right solution, while his ministers could not match his insight, he appeared worried after the court session. Shen Gong Wu Chun approached and asked, 'Why do you look worried after the court session?' King Zhuang of Chu responded, 'Because I, the unworthy king, found the right solution while my ministers could not match my insight, I am worried. It is said in the teachings of Zhonglun: "A ruler who finds a worthy advisor becomes a king, a worthy friend becomes a hegemon, and one who is doubted remains safe. But a ruler who plans alone and no one agrees with him will perish." Now, with my unworthiness, and my ministers unable to match my insight, is my state close to perishing? That is why I am worried.' King Zhuang of Chu was worried, while you, my lord, are joyful." The Marquis of Wei stepped back, bowed twice, and said, "Heaven has sent you, sir, to correct my mistake."

### Moral of the Story

The moral of the story is about the dangers of overestimating one's own wisdom and underestimating the value of collective wisdom. King Zhuang of Chu's concern reflects a wise ruler's awareness of the potential pitfalls of relying solely on personal judgment, which can lead to isolation and eventual downfall. In contrast, the Marquis of Wei's initial joy at his own insight highlights the arrogance that can accompany unchecked self-confidence. Wu Qi's intervention serves as a reminder that true leadership involves humility and the recognition of the importance of diverse perspectives.

### Counterpart in Western Thought

The concepts in this story have counterparts in Western thought, particularly in the ideas of humility, the value of counsel, and the dangers of hubris. For example:

1. **Humility and Leadership**: In Western philosophy, Aristotle emphasized the importance of humility in leadership. A good leader should recognize their limitations and value the input of others.

2. **Value of Counsel**: The Roman philosopher Cicero wrote about the importance of seeking advice and the dangers of making decisions in isolation. He believed that wise rulers should consult with knowledgeable advisors.

3. **Dangers of Hubris**: The concept of hubris, or excessive pride, is a common theme in Western literature and philosophy. It is often depicted as a fatal flaw that leads to the downfall of great individuals, as seen in Greek tragedies like "Oedipus Rex" and "Antigone."

Overall, the story from Xunzi resonates with these Western ideas, highlighting universal themes about the nature of wisdom, leadership, and the importance of humility. [end of text]
