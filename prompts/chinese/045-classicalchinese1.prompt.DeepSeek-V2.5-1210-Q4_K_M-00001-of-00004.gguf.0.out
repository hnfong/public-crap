### Q6: At the end of 滑稽列传, it is said that: "傳曰：「子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。」三子之才能誰最賢哉？辨治者當能別之。" -- explain what it means, and whether the comment is fair. (15 points)

The quote compares three famous administrators: **Zichan (子產)**, **Zijian (子賤)**, and **Ximen Bao (西門豹)**. It suggests:

- **Zichan** governed Zheng in a way that people **could not deceive** him due to his wisdom and strict governance.
- **Zijian** governed Shanfu in a way that people **did not want to deceive** him because of his kindness and moral influence.
- **Ximen Bao** governed Ye in a way that people **did not dare to deceive** him due to his authority and fearsome reputation.

The comment is **fair** because it highlights the unique leadership styles of each figure:

- **Zichan** relied on **wisdom and strict rules**.
- **Zijian** relied on **kindness and moral appeal**.
- **Ximen Bao** relied on **fear and authority**.

Each approach was effective in its context, and the comment invites readers to evaluate which style was the most admirable. Ximen Bao's method, while harsh, was necessary to dismantle deeply entrenched
