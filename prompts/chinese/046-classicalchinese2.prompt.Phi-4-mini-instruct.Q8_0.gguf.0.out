(1) Translation of the story into English:

The story from 荀子 (Xunzi) goes as follows:

The Duke of Wei, when planning matters, was always decisive, and his ministers could not catch up with him. When he returned to the palace, he was happy. Wu Qi said, "Have you ever heard the words of the King of Chu, the Zhuang, about this?" The Duke of Wei asked, "What did the King of Chu say?" Wu Qi replied, "The King of Chu, when planning matters, was decisive, and his ministers could not catch up with him. When he returned to the palace, he was worried. The Prime Minister Xun Gu asked, 'Why are you worried, Your Majesty?' The King of Chu said, 'I do not rely on grain when planning matters, and my ministers cannot catch up with me, so I am worried. The words of the wise man Zhuang Zi are: "A king who relies on grain when planning matters will lose his ministers; a king who relies on friends will lose his allies; a king who relies on suspicion will lose his state; a king who relies on his own plans will lose himself. Now, I rely on grain, and my ministers cannot catch up with me, so my state is almost lost. That is why I am worried. The King of Chu is worried, but you are happy.' The Duke of Wei stood in silence, bowed twice, and said, 'Heaven has sent the Master to correct my mistakes.'"

(2) Moral of the story:

The moral of the story is that relying on material wealth (grain) rather than wisdom, virtue, and the support of loyal ministers can lead to the downfall of a state. The Duke of Wei's happiness is based on superficial gains, while the King of Chu's worry reflects a deeper understanding of the importance of wise governance and the cultivation of loyal and capable ministers. The story emphasizes the value of moral and intellectual leadership over material wealth.

(3) Counterparts in Western (European) thought:

The concepts in the story have counterparts in Western (European) thought, particularly in the ideas of leadership and governance. For example:

- The importance of wise and virtuous leadership can be compared to the classical Greek concept of the "philosopher-king" as described by Plato in "The Republic," where the ideal ruler is someone who possesses both wisdom and virtue.
- The idea of relying on material wealth rather than wisdom and virtue can be compared to Machiavelli's "The Prince," where he discusses the importance of pragmatic and sometimes ruthless leadership to maintain power and stability.
- The concept of relying on loyal and capable ministers is similar to the Roman idea of the "optimate" class, which emphasized the importance of experienced and loyal advisors in governance.

Overall, the story highlights timeless themes of leadership, governance, and the dangers of prioritizing material wealth over wisdom and virtue, which are also present in Western philosophical thought. [end of text]
