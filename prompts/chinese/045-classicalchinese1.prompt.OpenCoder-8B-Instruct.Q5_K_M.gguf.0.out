Q1: The story is about a man named 西门豹 who, during the reign of Emperor 魏文侯, was appointed as the local lord of a city named 邺. He dealt with a situation where a certain group of people, known as 河伯, would regularly take women from the city for their own use. The story revolves around the man's efforts to prevent this from happening and the benefits it brought to the people of 邺.

Q2: The victims in the story were usually women who were taken by 河伯 for their own use.

Q3: The people deemed to benefit from the old practice of offering girls were the townsfolk of 邺.

Q4: The protagonist used force to deal with the situation. He sent a group of people to the 河伯's residence and threatened to take away their women if they did not comply with his demands.

Q5: The moral of the story is that it is important to respect the rights of others, even if it means using force. The protagonist's actions showed that he was willing to use force to protect the people from being taken advantage of. However, some people might argue that it was immoral to force others to do what they did not want to do. 

Q6: The phrase "子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。" means that 子產, the son of Emperor 閔公, was able to manage the city of 鄭 without being able to cheat the people. Similarly, 子賤, the son of Prince 管蔡, was able to manage the city of 單父 without being able to cheat the people. However, 西门豹, the son of Prince 管蔡, was able to manage the city of 邺 without being able to cheat the people. The claim that the three sons were all able to do this shows that they were all able to manage their respective cities without being able to cheat the people. This is not fair as it implies that they all had equal abilities, which is not the case.
