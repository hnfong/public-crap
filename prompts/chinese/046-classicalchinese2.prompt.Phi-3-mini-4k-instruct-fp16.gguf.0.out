This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

(1) During the reign of Wei Wu, plans were made and carried out, but none of the ministers could apprehend him, and he left with a smile. Zhou Zong, from Wu state, said, "There was a similar case in Chu where the King of Chu made plans and carried them out, but his ministers could not apprehend him, and he left with a sorrowful look. The diviner of Chu asked, 'If a ruler has a sorrowful look when leaving, what does it signify?' The King of Chu replied, 'If a ruler makes plans without sufficient provisions and the ministers cannot apprehend him, it signifies his folly. It goes as follows: When a ruler gains students as his subjects, gains allies as his friends, and gains suspicion as his adversaries, if he makes plans alone without others' support, he risks his own downfall. Now, since my land lacks provisions and my ministers cannot apprehend me, my state is on the brink of ruin. That's why I feel sorrow.' The King of Chu embraced this sorrow, while the ruler of Wei Wu embraced joy.' Later, the Wei Wu King reiterated, 'It seems to be an act of divine intervention that ministers cannot apprehend their rulers.'"


(2) The moral of this story is a lesson on the importance of considering the welfare and support of one's subjects, allies, and adversaries when making decisions. It warns against the pride and isolation of a ruler who acts solely on their own plans without the backing and support of those around them, leading to potential downfall and ruin. The story emphasizes that a ruler must not only rely on their own wisdom but also on the strength and cooperation of their ministers, allies, and the provisions secured for the state.


(3) Yes, the concepts in this story have counterparts in Western (European) thought, especially in the context of political philosophy and leadership. The notion of wise rulership, the importance of consulting advisors and allies, and the risks associated with authoritarian or isolationist tendencies are ideas that have been explored by various European philosophers and thinkers throughout history, such as Machiavelli's "The Prince," Montesquieu's "Spirit of the Laws," and even in the writings of Plato's "Republic." The story also reflects the idea of divine providence and intervention, a concept that has been present in Western thought since the time of the ancient Greeks and has been a part of Christian theology as well.<|end|>
