This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

(1) Translation:

Wei Wu Hou was planning an affair and made the right decision, which none of his ministers could match. After the court session, he looked pleased. Wu Qi stepped forward and said, "Have you ever heard the words of Chu Zhuang Wang from his attendants?" Wu Hou asked, "What were the words of Chu Zhuang Wang like?" Wu Qi replied, "Chu Zhuang Wang was planning an affair and made the right decision, which none of his ministers could match. After the court session, he looked worried. Shen Gong Wu Chen stepped forward and asked, 'Why did you look worried after the court session?' Zhuang Wang said, 'I made the right decision in planning the affair, and none of my ministers could match it, that's why I am worried. There is a saying in Zhong Li, "Among the feudal lords, those who consider themselves wise will perish, those who consider themselves to have worthy friends will become hegemons, those who are doubtful will survive, and those who consider themselves wise and have no one to match will perish." Now, I am not worthy, yet none of my ministers can match me, my country is close to perishing! That's why I am worried.' Chu Zhuang Wang was worried about this, yet you are pleased." Wu Hou, startled, bowed twice and said, "Heaven has sent you, sir, to correct my mistakes."

(2) Moral of the story:

The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should not be overly pleased with their own intelligence and abilities. Instead, they should be concerned if they cannot find ministers or advisors who can match or surpass them. A ruler needs capable people to assist and challenge them for the well-being of the state. If a ruler believes they are always right and no one can compare, it could lead to the downfall of the state.

(3) Counterpart in Western thought:

The concepts in this story have counterparts in Western thought, particularly in the ideas of checks and balances, and the importance of wise counsel. In ancient Greek philosophy, Plato's "The Republic" discusses the importance of philosopher-kings being advised by wise counselors. Similarly, in the works of Machiavelli, such as "The Prince," the importance of a ruler surrounding themselves with wise advisors and considering their advice is emphasized. Additionally, the idea of checks and balances in governance, as outlined by Montesquieu and implemented in many Western political systems, echoes the sentiment that a single person's power should be balanced and challenged by others to prevent misuse of power.
