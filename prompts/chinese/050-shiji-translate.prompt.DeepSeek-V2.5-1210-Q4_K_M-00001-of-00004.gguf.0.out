"The Biographies of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang"
Zhang Tingwei Shizhi was from Duyang, with the courtesy name Ji. He had an elder brother, Zhong, with whom he lived together. He became a Qi Lang (a type of imperial guard) by purchasing the position, serving Emperor Xiaowen, but after ten years, he had not been promoted and was not well-known. Shizhi said, "Prolonged service in office reduces Zhong's property, and it is not worthwhile." He wanted to resign and return home. Zhonglangjiang Yuan Ang knew of his virtue and regretted his departure, so he requested to transfer Shizhi to the position of Yezhe. After Shizhi finished his court duties, he took the opportunity to speak about matters that would be beneficial. Emperor Wen said, "Speak humbly, without overly lofty discussions, so that what is said can be implemented now." Thus, Shizhi spoke about the events between Qin and Han, the reasons for Qin's decline and Han's rise, for a long time. Emperor Wen praised him, and then appointed Shizhi as the Yezhe Puye.
Shizhi accompanied the emperor on an outing and ascended the Tiger Enclosure. The emperor asked the Shanglinwei about the records of various birds and beasts, asking more than ten questions, but the wei looked around and could not answer any of them. The Tiger Enclosure SeFu, standing nearby, took the opportunity to answer the emperor's questions about the records of birds and beasts very thoroughly, intending to demonstrate his ability to respond quickly and endlessly. Emperor Wen said, "Shouldn't the officials be like this? The wei is unreliable!" He then ordered Shizhi to appoint the sefu as the Shanglin Ling. Shizhi stood before the emperor for a long time and said, "What does Your Majesty think of Jiang Hou Zhou Bo?" The emperor replied, "A virtuous man." Shizhi then asked again, "What about Dongyang Hou Zhang Xiangru?" The emperor again replied, "A virtuous man." Shizhi said, "Jiang Hou and Dongyang Hou are known as virtuous men, yet these two men could not express their opinions verbally. How could they be expected to imitate this sefu's glib and quick tongue! Moreover, Qin relied on scribes and clerks, and the officials competed in being hasty and harsh, but their faults were merely superficial, lacking genuine compassion. As a result, they were unaware of their mistakes, and the decline continued until the Second Generation, leading to the collapse of the empire. Now, if Your Majesty promotes the sefu based on his eloquent speech, I fear that the world will follow this trend, competing in eloquence without substance. Furthermore, the influence of the lower on the higher is quicker than the shadow and echo, so one must be cautious in actions and decisions." Emperor Wen said, "Good." He then stopped the appointment of the sefu.
The emperor boarded his chariot and summoned Shizhi to ride alongside, slowly moving while asking Shizhi about the flaws of Qin. Shizhi spoke frankly. Upon reaching the palace, the emperor appointed Shizhi as the Gongche Ling.
Soon after, the Crown Prince and Liang Wang entered the court together by carriage but did not dismount at the Sima Gate. Shizhi pursued and stopped the Crown Prince and Liang Wang from entering the palace gate. He then impeached them for not dismounting at the public gate, which was disrespectful, and submitted the report. Empress Dowager Bo heard of this and Emperor Wen took off his crown to apologize, saying, "I have not taught my son properly." Empress Dowager Bo then sent an envoy with a decree to pardon the Crown Prince and Liang Wang, allowing them to enter. From this, Emperor Wen regarded Shizhi with special admiration and appointed him as Zhongdafu.
Shortly after, Shizhi was promoted to Zhonglangjiang. He accompanied the emperor to Baling, where they stayed facing north by the latrine. At that time, Lady Shen accompanied the emperor, who pointed to the Xin Feng Road and said to Lady Shen, "This is the road to Handan." He had Lady Shen play the zither, and the emperor sang along with the music, feeling a deep sense of sorrow. He turned to the ministers and said, "Alas! If the coffin were made of stone from Beishan, filled with hemp and silk, and sealed with lacquer, would it not be indestructible?" Those around him all said, "Excellent." Shizhi stepped forward and said, "If there is something desirable inside, even if Mount Nanshan were sealed, there would still be a gap; if there is nothing desirable inside, even without a stone coffin, what sorrow would there be?" Emperor Wen praised him. Later, Shizhi was appointed as Tingwei.
Shortly after, the emperor was traveling on the Zhongwei Bridge when a man emerged from under the bridge, startling the emperor's horse. The emperor ordered cavalry to arrest the man and hand him over to the Tingwei. Shizhi interrogated the man, who said, "I am a county resident. I heard the imperial procession and hid under the bridge. After a long time, I thought the procession had passed, so I came out and saw the imperial carriage and cavalry, and I ran away." The Tingwei ruled that since the man had violated the imperial procession, he should be fined. Emperor Wen was angry and said, "This man directly startled my horse. Fortunately, my horse is gentle; if it were another horse, wouldn't I have been injured? Yet the Tingwei only fines him!" Shizhi said, "The law is something shared by the emperor and the people. If the law states this and it is changed to a heavier punishment, the law will lose credibility among the people. Moreover, at that time, if the emperor had ordered the immediate execution, it would have been done. Now that it has been handed over to the Tingwei, the Tingwei is the公平 of the world, and if it tilts, the application of the law throughout the world will be uneven, and the people will not know where to place their hands and feet. I hope Your Majesty will consider this." After a long while, the emperor said, "The Tingwei's ruling is correct."
Later, someone stole the jade ring from the seat in front of the high temple, was captured, and Emperor Wen was angry, ordering the Tingwei to handle the case. Shizhi investigated the law and submitted a report stating that according to the law, stealing items from the ancestral temple should result in execution by public exposure. The emperor was greatly angered and said, "This man is without virtue, stealing the vessel of the former emperor. I referred the case to the Tingwei intending to have him executed by extermination of his clan, but you submitted it according to the law, which is not what I intended to uphold the ancestral temple." Shizhi took off his cap and kowtowed to apologize, saying, "The law is sufficient as it is. Moreover, the severity of the crime is determined by the circumstances. If stealing an item from the ancestral temple results in extermination, even if it were one in ten thousand, what would Your Majesty do if a foolish commoner took a handful of soil from Changling? How would you increase the punishment?" After a long time, Emperor Wen discussed the matter with Empress Dowager, and they agreed to the Tingwei's ruling. At that time, Zhongwei Zhou Yafu and Liang Xiang Shandu Hou Wang Tiankai saw that Shizhi upheld justice fairly, and they became close friends. From this, Tingwei Zhang was praised throughout the world.
After Emperor Wen's death, Emperor Jing ascended the throne, and Shizhi was afraid, claiming illness. He wanted to resign, fearing severe punishment; he wanted to apologize, but did not know how. Following Wang Sheng's advice, he eventually apologized, and Emperor Jing did not hold it against him.
Wang Sheng was skilled in the teachings of Huang Lao and was a recluse. Once, he was summoned to stand in the廷中, with the three dukes and nine ministers all present. Wang Sheng, an old man, said, "My sock has come loose," and turned to Tingwei Zhang, saying, "Tie my sock for me!" Shizhi knelt down and tied it. Afterward, someone said to Wang Sheng, "Why did you humiliate Tingwei Zhang in the廷, making him kneel to tie your sock?" Wang Sheng said, "I am old and lowly, and I know that I cannot benefit Tingwei Zhang. Tingwei Zhang is a renowned minister of the present day, so I intentionally humiliated him, making him kneel to tie my sock, to enhance his reputation." When the officials heard this, they esteemed Wang Sheng and respected Tingwei Zhang even more.
Tingwei Zhang served Emperor Jing for over a year as the Huainan Wang Xiang, still mindful of his previous offense. After some time, Shizhi passed away. His son, Zhang Zhi, courtesy name Changgong, served as a Daifu but was later dismissed. Because he could not accommodate himself to the world, he never took office again.
Feng Tang's grandfather was from Zhao, and his father moved to Dai. When Han rose, they moved to Anling. Tang was known for his filial piety and served as the Zhonglang Shu Chang, working for Emperor Wen. Emperor Wen, passing by in a carriage, asked Tang, "Old man, why are you serving as a lang? Where is your home?" Tang answered truthfully. Emperor Wen said, "When I was in Dai, my Shangshi Jian Gao Qu mentioned to me several times the virtue of Zhao general Li Qi, who fought at Julu. Now, whenever I eat, my thoughts never leave Julu. Do you know about this?" Tang replied, "He was not as good as Lian Po or Li Mu as a general." The emperor asked, "Why?" Tang said, "My grandfather was in Zhao, serving as an official率將, and he was close to Li Mu. My father was the Dai Xiang and was close to Zhao general Li Qi, so I know his character." After hearing about Lian Po and Li Mu's characters, the emperor was pleased and slapped his thigh, saying, "Alas! If only I had Lian Po or Li Mu as my general at that time, would I have worried about the Xiongnu?" Tang said, "Your servant! Even if Your Majesty had Lian Po or Li Mu, you would not have been able to use them." The emperor was angry and left for the inner palace. After a long time, he summoned Tang and rebuked him, saying, "Why did you humiliate me in front of everyone? Is there no private place?" Tang apologized, saying, "I am a vulgar man and did not know the taboos."
At that time, the Xiongnu had recently invaded Chaonao, killing the Beidi Duwei Ang. The emperor was concerned about the Hu threat and finally asked Tang again, "Why do you know that I could not use Lian Po or Li Mu?" Tang replied, "I have heard that in ancient times, when the king sent out his general, he would kneel and push the chariot, saying that within the gate, the king governs; beyond the gate, the general governs. Military merits,爵赏, and rewards were all decided outside, and then reported back. This is not an empty statement. My grandfather said that Li Mu, as a Zhao general stationed at the border, used the taxes from the military market to reward the soldiers, with the rewards decided outside, without interference from the center. Entrusting the task and demanding success, Li Mu was able to fully utilize his intelligence and abilities, dispatching 1,300 armored chariots, 13,000 archers, and 100,000 soldiers with golden medals, thus driving the Xiongnu north, defeating the Donghu, annihilating the Danlin, suppressing the powerful Qin in the west, and supporting Han, Wei in the south. At that time, Zhao was nearly a hegemon. Later, when Zhao Wang Qian came to power, his mother was a singer. Zhao Wang Qian, influenced by Guo Kai's slander, eventually executed Li Mu and appointed Yan Ju to replace him. As a result, the army was defeated, the soldiers fled, and Zhao was captured and annihilated by Qin. Now, I have heard that Wei Shang is the Yunzhong Shou, and he uses all the taxes from the military market to reward the soldiers, [出] his private funds, and every five days slaughters a cow to entertain the guests, military officers, and舍人, causing the Xiongnu to stay far away, not approaching the Yunzhong fortress. Once, the Xiongnu invaded, and Shang led the chariots and cavalry to attack, killing many of them. The soldiers are all common sons, recruited from the fields to join the army, how would they know the military records and formations? They fight all day, cutting off heads and capturing enemies, reporting their merits to the莫府, but if one word does not match, the scribes use the law to restrain them. The rewards are not given, and the officials strictly enforce the law. I am foolish, but I believe that Your Majesty's law is too strict, the rewards too light, and the punishments too heavy. Moreover, Yunzhong Shou Wei Shang was sentenced for a discrepancy of six levels in reporting the number of heads captured, and Your Majesty handed him over to the officials, stripping his title and punishing him. From this, it can be said that even if Your Majesty had Lian Po or Li Mu, you would not have been able to use them. I am truly foolish, having offended the taboos, and I deserve death!" Emperor Wen was pleased. On that day, he ordered Feng Tang to carry the节 to pardon Wei Shang and reinstate him as Yunzhong Shou, and appointed Tang as the Cheqi Duwei, in charge of the Zhongwei and the chariot soldiers of the prefectures and kingdoms.
In the seventh year, Emperor Jing ascended the throne and appointed Tang as the Chu Xiang, but later dismissed him. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne, he sought virtuous and talented individuals and nominated Feng Tang. At that time, Tang was over ninety years old and could no longer serve as an official, so his son, Feng Sui, was appointed as a lang. Sui, courtesy name Wangsun, was also an extraordinary man and was friendly with me.
The Grand Historian said: Zhang Ji's words on the virtuous man, adhering to the law without bending to the will; Feng Gong's discussion on the generals, how meaningful! How meaningful! The saying goes, "If you do not know a man, look at his friends." The praises of these two men can be inscribed in the halls of the temple. The Book says, "Without partiality or partisanship, the kingly way is broad; without partisanship or partiality, the kingly way is smooth." Zhang Ji and Feng Gong come close to this. [end of text]
