 This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

 (1) Translation:

War Lord Wei was planning and making decisions that were always correct, and his ministers could not match his wisdom. After leaving the court, he had a joyful expression. Wukui approached him and asked, "Have you ever heard the words of Zhou Zhuang King from the left and right?" Wei Wu King replied, "What were the words of Zhou Zhuang King?" Wukui answered, "Zhou Zhuang King used to say that when he planned and made decisions that were always correct, and his ministers could not match his wisdom, he would leave the court with a worried expression. His minister, Shen Gong Meng, asked him, 'Why do you have a worried expression?' Zhou Zhuang King replied, 'I am worried because I plan and make decisions that are always correct, and my ministers cannot match my wisdom. This is why I am worried. This is what Shi Zhou said: 'A king who has a wise teacher will become a king, a king who has a good friend will become a king, a king who has a doubtful friend will survive, but a king who thinks he is the best will perish.' Now, I am not wise, but my ministers cannot match my wisdom. My country is close to perishing. This is why I am worried.' Zhou Zhuang King was worried, but you are happy. This is why I am worried." Wei Wu King blushed and bowed twice, saying, "Heaven has sent you to correct my mistakes."

(2) Moral of the story:

The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should be concerned about the well-being of their country and the people, even if they are successful in their decisions. A ruler should not be complacent or overly confident in their abilities, as this can lead to downfall.

(3) Counterpart in Western (European) thought:

The concepts in the story have counterparts in Western thought, particularly in the ideas of humility, self-awareness, and the importance of wise counsel. For example, the story echoes the teachings of ancient Greek philosophers like Socrates, who emphasized the importance of self-knowledge and the recognition of one's own limitations. Additionally, the story reflects the idea that a wise ruler should seek advice from knowledgeable and trustworthy advisors, which is a common theme in Western political philosophy.
