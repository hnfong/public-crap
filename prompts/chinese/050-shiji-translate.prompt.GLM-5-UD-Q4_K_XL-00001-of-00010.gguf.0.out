"The Biography of 張釋之 and 馮唐"

The Commandant of Justice 張釋之 was a man of 堵陽; his courtesy name was 季. He had an older brother named 仲 with whom he lived. Because of his property, he became a Cavalry Gentleman and served Emperor 孝文. For ten years he was not transferred, and he had no reputation. 釋之 said, "Long service diminishes 仲's property; I will not succeed." He wished to resign and return home. The General of the Gentlemen of the Household 袁盎 knew his worth and regretted his departure, so he requested that 釋之 be moved to fill the post of Receptionist. After 釋之 had finished his audience, he spoke of matters of expediency. Emperor 文 said, "Lower your aim; do not engage in high theory, make it so it can be implemented today." Thereupon, 釋之 spoke of events between 秦 and 漢, and why 秦 lost and 漢 rose, for a long time. Emperor 文 praised it and appointed 釋之 as Chief Receptionist.

釋之 accompanied the Emperor on an excursion and ascended the Tiger Enclosure. The Emperor asked the Warden of 上林 about the registers of the various birds and beasts; he asked more than ten questions. The Warden looked left and right, completely unable to answer. The Foreman of the Tiger Enclosure, from the side, answered for the Warden regarding the registers of birds and beasts the Emperor asked about, very thoroughly, wishing to show off his ability to respond orally without end. Emperor 文 said, "Should an official not be like this? The Warden is incompetent!" He then ordered 釋之 to appoint the Foreman as Prefect of 上林. 釋之 stepped forward after a while and said, "Your Majesty, what manner of man do you consider 絳侯周勃 to be?" The Emperor said, "He is an elder." He asked again, "What manner of man is 東陽侯張相如?" The Emperor again said, "An elder." 釋之 said, "Now 絳侯 and 東陽侯 are called elders, yet these two men, when discussing affairs, could barely get the words out of their mouths. How could they emulate this Foreman's glib and rapid tongue! Moreover, 秦 employed clerks of the pen; the officials strove to outdo one another in harshness and scrutiny. However, their flaw was merely formal compliance, lacking the substance of compassion. Therefore, they heard not of their faults, declined to the Second Generation, and the empire collapsed like earth. Now, because of the Foreman's eloquence, Your Majesty promotes him beyond his station. I fear the empire will follow this trend, striving for eloquence without substance. Moreover, those below are influenced by those above faster than an echo responds to a sound; your actions cannot but be examined carefully." Emperor 文 said, "Good." He then stopped and did not appoint the Foreman.

The Emperor mounted his carriage, summoned 釋之 to attend him, and proceeded slowly, asking 釋之 about the faults of 秦. He answered fully and truthfully. Upon reaching the palace, the Emperor appointed 釋之 as Prefect of the Public Carriages.

Shortly after, the Crown Prince and the King of 梁 rode together to court. They did not dismount at the Sima Gate. Thereupon, 釋之 pursued them and stopped the Crown Prince and the King of 梁 from entering the palace gate. He then impeached them for not dismounting at the public gate, which was disrespectful, and reported this. When 薄太后 heard of this, Emperor 文 took off his hat and apologized, saying, "I was not careful in teaching my sons." 薄太后 then sent an envoy with an edict to pardon the Crown Prince and the King of 梁, and only then were they allowed to enter. Emperor 文 considered 釋之 extraordinary for this and appointed him as Grand Master of the Palace.

Shortly after, he became General of the Gentlemen of the Household. He accompanied the Emperor to 霸陵. They stood on the north side overlooking the toilet pit. At that time, Lady 慎 was present. The Emperor pointed out the road to 新豐 to Lady 慎 and said, "This is the road that leads to 邯鄲." He made Lady 慎 play the se, and the Emperor leaned against the se and sang. His mood was sorrowful and melancholy. He looked back at the ministers and said, "Alas! If we use the stones of the North Mountain for the outer coffin, and stuff it with ramie and cotton, and lacquer it in between, how could it be moved!" The attendants all said, "Good." 釋之 stepped forward and said, "If there is something desirable inside, even if you seal it with the Southern Mountain, there will still be cracks. If there is nothing desirable inside, even without a stone coffin, what is there to worry about!" Emperor 文 praised this. Later, he appointed 釋之 as Commandant of Justice.

Shortly after, the Emperor went out across the 中渭 Bridge. A man ran out from under the bridge, startling the horses of the carriage. Thereupon, he sent cavalry to arrest him and handed him to the Commandant of Justice. 釋之 interrogated him. The man said, "I am a man from the county. I heard the clearing of the road and hid under the bridge. After a long time, thinking the procession had passed, I came out. I saw the carriage and cavalry and just ran." The Commandant of Justice reported the sentence: the man violated the clearing of the road and should be fined. Emperor 文 was angry and said, "This man personally startled my horses. My horses are gentle, luckily. If they were other horses, would they not surely have injured me? Yet the Commandant of Justice sentences him to a fine!" 釋之 said, "The law is what the Son of Heaven shares with the world. Now, if the law is like this and you make it heavier, the law will not be trusted by the people. Moreover, at that moment, if Your Majesty had ordered him executed on the spot, that would be the end of it. But now that it has been handed to the Commandant of Justice, the Commandant of Justice is the balance of the world. If it tips once, the application of the law throughout the world will become light or heavy accordingly; where shall the people place their hands and feet? I hope Your Majesty will examine this." After a long while, the Emperor said, "The Commandant of Justice is correct."

Later, someone stole a jade ring from before the seat in the High Temple. He was caught. Emperor 文 was angry and handed him to the Commandant of Justice for punishment. 釋之, according to the law, reported that stealing imperial objects from the ancestral temple is punishable by exposure of the body in the marketplace. The Emperor was very angry and said, "This man is without the Way, stealing vessels from the temple of the late Emperor. I handed him to the Commandant of Justice because I wanted to exterminate his clan. But you report according to the law; this is not my intention in reverently maintaining the ancestral temple." 釋之 took off his hat, knocked his head on the ground, and apologized, saying, "The law is sufficient for this. Moreover, while the crime is the same, the punishment differs based on whether it goes against or follows the order. Now, if he is executed for stealing from the ancestral temple, suppose one ten-thousandth chance, if a foolish person took a handful of earth from 長陵, how would Your Majesty increase the punishment?" After a long time, Emperor 文 spoke to the Empress Dowager about it, and then approved the Commandant of Justice's sentence. At that time, the Commandant of the Capital 條侯周亞夫 and the Chancellor of 梁, the Marquis of 山都王恬開, saw that 釋之 held his arguments fairly, so they became close friends with him. Commandant 張 was praised by the world for this.

Later, Emperor 文 died, and Emperor 景 ascended the throne. 釋之 was afraid and claimed illness. He wished to resign, fearing a great punishment would arrive; he wished to apologize in person but did not know how it would be received. He used the plan of 王生, finally apologized, and Emperor 景 did not hold a grudge.

王生 was a man skilled in the words of 黃老; he was a private scholar. Once, he was summoned to sit in the court. The Three Dukes and Nine Ministers were all gathered standing. 王生 was an old man. He said, "My sock has come undone." He looked at Commandant 張 and said, "Tie my sock for me!" 釋之 knelt and tied it. Afterward, someone said to 王生, "Why did you humiliate Commandant 張 in court, making him kneel to tie your sock?" 王生 said, "I am old and lowly. I estimate that I am of no benefit to Commandant 張. Commandant 張 is now a famous minister of the world. I therefore intentionally humiliated the Commandant, making him kneel to tie my sock, wishing to increase his prestige." The lords heard this and considered 王生 worthy and respected Commandant 張 even more.

Commandant 張 served Emperor 景 for over a year, then became Chancellor of the King of 淮南, still because of the previous offense. After a long time, 釋之 died. His son was named 張摯, courtesy name 長公. He reached the rank of Grand Master but was dismissed. Because he could not accommodate himself to the times, he never served in office again.

馮唐's grandfather was a man of 趙. His father moved to 代. When 漢 rose, they moved to 安陵. 馮唐 was known for filial piety and became Chief of the Gentlelemen of the Household, serving Emperor 文. Emperor 文 passed by in a carriage and asked 馮唐, "Elder, how did you become a Gentleman? Where is your home?" 馮唐 answered truthfully. Emperor 文 said, "When I lived in 代, my Provisioner 高袪 often spoke to me of the worthiness of the 趙 general 李齊, who fought below 鉅鹿. Now, every time I eat, my thoughts are never far from 鉅鹿. Do you know of this?" 馮唐 replied, "He is not as good as 廉頗 and 李牧 as generals." The Emperor said, "Why?" 馮唐 said, "My grandfather, when in 趙, was a commander of soldiers and was friendly with 李牧. My father was the Chancellor of 代 and was friendly with the 趙 general 李齊; he knew his character." After the Emperor heard the character of 廉頗 and 李牧, he was pleased and slapped his thigh, saying, "Alas! If I could only have 廉頗 and 李牧 as my generals now, would I worry about the 匈奴!" 馮唐 said, "Your Majesty, even if you had 廉頗 and 李牧, you could not use them." The Emperor was angry, got up, and went into the forbidden quarters. After a long while, he summoned 馮唐 and scolded him, saying, "Why did you humiliate me in public? Was there no private place?" 馮唐 apologized, saying, "I am a rustic man and do not know taboos."

At that time, the 匈奴 had just greatly invaded 朝那 and killed 卬, the Commandant of 北地. The Emperor was concerned about the 胡 invaders, so he finally asked 馮唐 again, "How do you know I cannot use 廉頗 and 李牧?" 馮唐 replied, "I have heard that when ancient kings dispatched generals, they knelt and pushed the carriage wheel, saying, 'What is within the threshold, I control; what is outside the threshold, the general controls.' Military merits, rewards, and promotions were all decided outside, and reported back upon return. This is not empty talk. My grandfather said that when 李牧 was a general for 趙 guarding the border, the taxes from the military markets were all used by him to feast the soldiers. Rewards were decided outside, without interference from the center. He was entrusted with the task and held responsible for success. Therefore, 李牧 was able to fully utilize his abilities. He dispatched 1,300 selected chariots, 13,000 archers, and 100,000 elite warriors. Thus, he drove the 單于 north, broke the 東胡, destroyed the 澹林, suppressed the strong 秦 in the west, and supported 韓 and 魏 in the south. At that time, 趙 was almost a hegemon. Later, King 遷 of 趙 ascended the throne; his mother was a singing girl. When King 遷 ascended, he used the slander of 郭開 and finally executed 李牧, ordering 顏聚 to replace him. Because of this, the army was broken and the soldiers fled; they were captured and destroyed by 秦. Now, I have privately heard that 魏尚 is the Administrator of 雲中. He uses all the taxes from the military markets to feast the soldiers, and spends his own private money to slaughter an ox every five days to feast guests, military officers, and retainers. Therefore, the 匈奴 avoid him and do not go near the 雲中 border. The enemy entered once, and 魏尚 led the chariots and cavalry to attack them, killing many. Now, the soldiers are all sons of families who rose from the fields to join the army; how would they know the registers and tallies? They fight with all their might all day, decapitating enemies and capturing prisoners. When they report merits to the headquarters, if one word does not match, the clerks use the law to bind them. Their rewards are not carried out, but the officials strictly apply the law. I am foolish and think Your Majesty's laws are too clear, rewards too light, and punishments too heavy. Moreover, the Administrator of 雲中, 魏尚, was charged because the number of heads captured in his merit report was off by six. Your Majesty handed him to the officials, stripped his title, and sentenced him to hard labor. From this we can say, even if Your Majesty had 廉頗 and 李牧, you could not use them. I am truly foolish and have touched upon taboos; my crime is death, death!" Emperor 文 was pleased. That day, he ordered 馮唐 to hold the imperial tally to pardon 魏尚 and restore him as Administrator of 雲中, and he appointed 馮唐 as Commandant of Chariots and Cavalry, in charge of the soldiers of the Commandant of the Capital and the commanderies and kingdoms.

In the seventh year, Emperor 景 ascended the throne and made 馮唐 the Chancellor of 楚, but he was dismissed. When Emperor 武 ascended, he sought worthy men and recommended 馮唐. 馮唐 was then over ninety years old and could no longer serve as an official, so his son 馮遂 was made a Gentleman. 馮遂's courtesy name was 王孫; he was also an extraordinary man and was friendly with me.

The Grand Historian says: 張季's words regarding the elders, his upholding of the law without flattery; 馮公's discussion of generals, how flavorful it was! How flavorful it was! The saying goes, "If you do not know the man, look at his friends." The praises of these two gentlemen can be inscribed in the ancestral temple. The *Book of Documents* says, "Without partiality, without partisanship, the King's Way is broad; without partisanship, without partiality, the King's Way is level." 張季 and 馮公 came close to this.
