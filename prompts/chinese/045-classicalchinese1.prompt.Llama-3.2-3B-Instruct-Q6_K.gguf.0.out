Consider the following text from 滑稽列传 and answer questions:

```
魏文侯时，西门豹为邺令。豹往到邺，会长老，问之民所疾苦。长老曰：「苦为河伯娶妇，以故贫。」豹问其故，对曰：「邺三老、廷掾常岁赋敛百姓，收取其钱得数百万，用其二三十万为河伯娶妇，与祝巫共分其余钱持归。当其时，巫行视小家女好者，云是当为河伯妇，即娉取。洗沐之，为治新缯绮縠衣，闲居斋戒；为治斋宫河上，张缇绛帷，女居其中。为具牛酒饭食，行十余日。共粉饰之，如嫁女床席，令女居其上，浮之河中。始浮，行数十里乃没。其人家有好女者，恐大巫祝为河伯取之，以故多持女远逃亡。以故城中益空无人，又困贫，所从来久远矣。民人俗语曰『即不为河伯娶妇，水来漂没，溺其人民』云。」西门豹曰：「至为河伯娶妇时，愿三老、巫祝、父老送女河上，幸来告语之，吾亦往送女。」皆曰：「诺。」

至其时，西门豹往会之河上。三老、官属、豪长者、里父老皆会，以人民往观之者三二千人。其巫，老女子也，已年七十。从弟子女十人所，皆衣缯单衣，立大巫后。西门豹曰：「呼河伯妇来，视其好丑。」即将女出帷中，来至前。豹视之，顾谓三老、巫祝、父老曰：「是女子不好，烦大巫妪为入报河伯，得更求好女，后日送之。」即使吏卒共抱大巫妪投之河中。有顷，曰：「巫妪何久也？弟子趣之！」复以弟子一人投河中。有顷，曰：「弟子何久也？复使一人趣之！」复投一弟子河中。凡投三弟子。西门豹曰：「巫妪弟子是女子也，不能白事，烦三老为入白之。」复投三老河中。西门豹簪笔磬折，向河立待良久。长老、吏傍观者皆惊恐。西门豹顾曰：「巫妪、三老不来还，柰之何？」欲复使廷掾与豪长者一人入趣之。皆叩头，叩头且破，额血流地，色如死灰。西门豹曰：「诺，且留待之须臾。」须臾，豹曰：「廷掾起矣。状河伯留客之久，若皆罢去归矣。」邺吏民大惊恐，从是以后，不敢复言为河伯娶妇。

西门豹即发民凿十二渠，引河水灌民田，田皆溉。当其时，民治渠少烦苦，不欲也。豹曰：「民可以乐成，不可与虑始。今父老子弟虽患苦我，然百岁后期令父老子孙思我言。」至今皆得水利，民人以给足富。十二渠经绝驰道，到汉之立，而长吏以为十二渠桥绝驰道，相比近，不可。欲合渠水，且至驰道合三渠为一桥。邺民人父老不肯听长吏，以为西门君所为也，贤君之法式不可更也。长吏终听置之。故西门豹为邺令，名闻天下，泽流后世，无绝已时，几可谓非贤大夫哉！

I'll answer the questions one by one:

Q1: The story is about a man named Wei Wen Hou who becomes the governor of the city of Nanyang. He discovers that the previous governor, Ximen Bao, was using the city's wealth to fund lavish weddings for the local elite, including the river goddess. Wen Hou decides to put an end to this practice and instead uses the city's resources to irrigate the land, benefiting the common people.

Q2: The victims in the story were usually young women, often chosen based on their physical appearance, who were forced to be sacrificed to the river goddess as part of the wedding ceremony.

Q3: The women who benefited from the old practice of offering girls were the local elite, including the river goddess and the wealthy families who participated in the wedding ceremonies.

Q4: The protagonist used a combination of both wits and force to deal with the situation. He initially tried to reason with the old man and the river goddess, but when they refused to cooperate, he resorted to using his power to force them to comply. He also used his authority to punish those who opposed him, including the old man and the river goddess's disciples.

Q5: The morality of the protagonist's actions is a matter of debate. Some might argue that he was justified in putting an end to the cruel practice of sacrificing young women, while others might see his actions as ruthless and tyrannical. From a utilitarian perspective, the benefits to the common people outweigh the costs, but from a moral perspective, the use of force and coercion raises questions about the value of human life and the importance of respecting the autonomy of individuals.

Q6: The comment suggests that the three protagonists (Wen Hou, the old man, and the river goddess) have different levels of moral character. The comment implies that Wen Hou's actions are the most virtuous, as he is able to balance his own interests with the needs of the common people. However, this comment is not entirely fair, as Wen Hou's actions were also driven by a desire for personal gain and a desire to assert his authority. The old man's actions, on the other hand, were motivated by a desire to protect his own interests and those of his community, and the river goddess's actions were driven by a desire to maintain her power and influence. Ultimately, the comment oversimplifies the complexities of human morality and the motivations of the characters involved. [end of text]
