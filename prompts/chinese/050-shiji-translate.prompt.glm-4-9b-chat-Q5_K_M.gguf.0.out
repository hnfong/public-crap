The Biography of Zhang Shezhi and Feng Tang
Zhang Shezhi, the Marquis of Tingwei, was from Douyang, with the character name Ji. He had an elder brother, Zhong, living together with him. He served as a cavalry officer under Emperor Xiaowen, but after ten years, he was not promoted and remained unknown. Shezhi said, "Long-term service has depleted my brother's property, and I have not achieved success." He wanted to resign and return home. General Yuan Yang, knowing his talent, regretted his departure and asked to transfer Shezhi to be a court usher. After Shezhi finished his morning court duties, he brought up some convenient matters. Emperor Xiaowen said, "Lower your tone, do not speak too highly, let it be something that can be implemented today." Therefore, Shezhi spoke about the events between the Qin and Han dynasties, why the Qin dynasty lost and the Han dynasty rose, for a long time. Emperor Xiaowen praised him and appointed Shezhi as the Chief Court Usher.

Shezhi accompanied the emperor on a visit to the tiger pit. The emperor asked the Director of the Imperial Gardens about the records of various birds and beasts, asking more than ten questions. The director looked around helplessly and was unable to answer. The keeper of the tiger pit, standing by, answered the emperor's questions about the records of the birds and beasts very thoroughly, wanting to show his ability to respond endlessly. Emperor Xiaowen said, "Should officials be like this? The director is unreliable!" He then ordered Shezhi to appoint the keeper as the Director of the Imperial Gardens. Shezhi asked before leaving, "Your Majesty, what kind of person is Marquis Jiao of Jinyu?" The emperor said, "An elder." He then asked again, "What kind of person is Marquis Zhang Xiang of Dongyang?" The emperor replied again, "An elder." Shezhi said, "Marquis Jiao of Jinyu and Marquis Zhang Xiang of Dongyang are called elders, but these two men have never been able to express their opinions. How can they imitate this keeper's cunning and quick-witted tongue? Moreover, the Qin dynasty entrusted the officials who handled documents, and the officials competed with each other to be strict and meticulous, but their shortcomings were only in formalities, without the essence of compassion. Therefore, their mistakes were not known, and gradually led to the fall of the second emperor, and the collapse of the empire. Now, Your Majesty has promoted the keeper because of his eloquence, and I am afraid that the people will follow suit, competing for eloquence without substance. Moreover, the influence of the lower on the higher is as quick as the shadow of the sun, and it is necessary to be careful in making decisions." Emperor Xiaowen said, "Good." He then stopped and did not appoint the keeper.

The emperor got on the carriage, summoned Shezhi to ride with him, and asked him about the shortcomings of the Qin dynasty. Shezhi answered sincerely. When they reached the palace, the emperor appointed Shezhi as the Marquis of the Imperial Carriages.

Not long after, the crown prince and the Marquis of Liang rode together to the palace without dismounting at the Marshal's Gate. Shezhi chased after them and stopped them from entering the palace gate. He then accused them of not showing respect by not dismounting at the public gate and reported it. When Empress Dowager Bo heard about it, Emperor Xiaowen removed his crown and apologized, saying, "I did not teach my son to be careful." Empress Dowager Bo then sent messengers to carry her edict to pardon the crown prince and the Marquis of Liang, and they were then allowed to enter. Emperor Xiaowen was impressed by Shezhi from then on and appointed him as the Middle Minister.

Not long after, he was promoted to the position of Middle Minister. Accompanying the emperor on a visit to the Marquis of Bao's tomb, he lived in the northern latrine. At that time, Empress Dowager Shun was accompanying him, and the emperor pointed out the new Fengfeng Road to Empress Dowager Shun, saying, "This is the road to Handan." He asked Empress Dowager Shun to play the zither, and he leaned against the zither and sang, feeling sad and melancholic. He turned to the ministers and said, "Alas! If there is something desirable inside the tomb, even if it is made of stone from the North Mountain, it can still be moved. If there is nothing desirable inside, then what is there to worry about even without a stone coffin?" Everyone around said, "Good." Shezhi stepped forward and said, "If there is something desirable inside, even if it is as solid as the South Mountain, there will still be a crack; if there is nothing desirable inside, then even without a stone coffin, what is there to worry about?" Emperor Xiaowen praised him. Later, he appointed Shezhi as the Marquis of Tingwei.

Not long after, the emperor traveled out to the central Weishui Bridge, and a man came out from under the bridge, frightening the imperial horses. The emperor then ordered his men to catch him and send him to the Marquis of Tingwei. Shezhi investigated the case. He said, "A county person came, heard the noise of the procession, hid under the bridge. After a long time, thinking that the procession had passed, he came out, saw the imperial carriage and horses, and ran away." The Marquis of Tingwei Qin Dang, when one person violated the ban on the procession, was sentenced to pay a fine. Emperor Xiaowen was angry and said, "This person personally frightened my horses. Since my horses are gentle, if they were any other horse, wouldn't they have injured me? Yet the Marquis of Tingwei sentences him to pay a fine!" Shezhi said, "The law is what the emperor and the people of the world have in common. Now, if the law is like this and we change it to be stricter, then the law will not be trusted by the people. Moreover, at that time, if the emperor had ordered his execution, that would have been it. Now that he has been sent to the Marquis of Tingwei, the Marquis of Tingwei is the standard for the law in the world. If one case is handled lightly, then all laws will be treated lightly, and where will the people put their hands and feet? Only Your Majesty should consider this." After a long time, the emperor said, "The Marquis of Tingwei is right."

Later, someone stole a jade ring from the front of the Grand Temple, was caught, and Emperor Xiaowen was angry, ordering the Marquis of Tingwei to investigate. Shezhi investigated according to the law and submitted a report, recommending that the thief be executed. Emperor Xiaowen was extremely angry and said, "How can a person be so shameless as to steal the artifacts from the temple of the former emperor? I entrusted this matter to the Marquis of Tingwei, wanting to have him executed, but you submit a report according to the law, which is not what I want to do to honor the temple." Shezhi removed his crown and bowed his head in apology, saying, "The law is sufficient. Moreover, the crime is equal, but the difference is in whether it is a rebellion or not. Now, if the temple artifacts are stolen and the thief is executed, what if a foolish person were to take a handful of earth from Changling? How would Your Majesty punish him?" After a long time, Emperor Xiaowen discussed this with Empress Dowager Bo, and she agreed to allow the Marquis of Tingwei to make the decision. At that time, the Marquis of Zhou Yafu, Marquis of the Middle Minister, and Marquis Wang Tiankai of the Marquis of Shandu saw that Shezhi's judgment was fair and became close friends. Marquis Zhang Tingwei was then praised by the world.

After Emperor Xiaowen died, Emperor Jing was enthroned, and Shezhi was afraid, claiming to be ill and wanting to resign, fearing that he would be severely punished. He wanted to apologize, but did not know how. Following the plan of Wang Sheng, he finally apologized, and Emperor Jing did not punish him.

Wang Sheng was good at speaking the teachings of Huanglao and was a reclusive scholar. He had once been summoned to live in the court, where the three marquises and nine ministers were all present. Wang Sheng, an old man, said, "I need to untie my socks," turned to Marquis Zhang Tingwei and said, "Please tie my socks for me!" Shezhi knelt down and tied them. After he finished, someone said to Wang Sheng, "Why did you humiliate Marquis Zhang Tingwei in court, making him kneel to tie your socks?" Wang Sheng said, "I am old and lowly, and I estimate that I will never be of any benefit to Marquis Zhang Tingwei. Marquis Zhang Tingwei is a famous minister in the world today. That is why I humiliated Marquis Zhang Tingwei, making him kneel to tie my socks, to emphasize his importance." When the ministers heard about this, they admired Wang Sheng and respected Marquis Zhang Tingwei even more.

Marquis Zhang Tingwei served Emperor Jing for more than a year and became the Chancellor of Huainan. He was still punished for his past mistakes. After a long time, Shezhi died. His son was Zhang Zong, with the character name Changgong, who served as a minister and was later demoted. Because he could not gain favor in the world, he never served in office.

Feng Tang was from a family of Zhao people. His father moved to Dai. After the Han dynasty rose, they moved to Anling. Tang was known for his filial piety and served as the Chief of the Middle Minister, serving Emperor Xiaowen. When Emperor Xiaowen passed by in his carriage, he asked Tang, "Old man, how did you become a minister? Where is your home?" Tang answered truthfully. Emperor Xiaowen said, "When I was in Dai, my food supervisor Gao Shu often told me about the virtue of Zhao General Li Qi, who fought at the battle of Julu. Now, every time I eat, I can't help but think of Julu." He asked, "Does your father know about this?" Tang replied, "He is not as good as Marquis Lianpi and General Li Mu." The emperor asked, "Why?" Tang said, "When my great-grandfather was in Zhao, he was an officer (died) and was good friends with General Li Mu. My father was the Chancellor of Dai and was good friends with General Li Qi, knowing what kind of person he was." After hearing about Marquis Lianpi and General Li Mu, the emperor was pleased and struck his thigh, saying, "Alas! If I could have Marquis Lianpi and General Li Mu as my generals, I wouldn't worry about the Xiongnu!" Tang said, "Your Majesty, even if you have Marquis Lianpi and General Li Mu, you won't be able to use them." The emperor was angry and went into the palace. After a long time, he summoned Tang and scolded him, saying, "Why do you publicly humiliate me? Don't you have a private place?" Tang apologized, saying, "I am an ignorant person and do not know about taboos."

At that time, the Xiongnu had just made a major incursion into the Chao that year, killing the Marshal of the Northern Territories, Yang. The emperor was worried about the Xiongnu and finally asked Tang again, "How do you know that I can't use Marquis Lianpi and General Li Mu?" Tang replied, "I have heard that in ancient times, when the king sent a general, he would kneel and push the wheel, saying, 'Within the palace, I rule; outside the palace, the general rules.' All military achievements and rewards were decided outside, and reported back. This is not an empty talk. My great-grandfather said that General Li Mu, when he was the general of Zhao, used the rent from the military market for the entertainment of the soldiers, and the rewards were decided outside, without interference from the center. He was entrusted and responsible for success, so General Li Mu was able to fully utilize his intelligence, sending 1,300 chariots, 13,000 archers, and 100,000 gold soldiers. Therefore, he drove the Xiongnu north, defeated the Donghu, destroyed the Danlin, suppressed the strong Qin in the west, and supported the Han and Wei in the south. At that time, Zhao was almost a hegemon. Later, when King Zhaoxuan was enthroned, his mother was a courtesan. When Zhaoxuan was enthroned, he used Guo Kai's slander to finally execute General Li Mu, replacing him with Yan Ju. Therefore, the army was defeated and the soldiers were defeated, and they were captured and annihilated by the Qin. Now, I have heard that Wei Shang is the governor of Yunzhong, and he uses all the rent from the military market to entertain the soldiers, and he also spends private money, killing a cow every five days to entertain guests, military officials, and attendants. Therefore, the Xiongnu have kept their distance and do not come near the pass of Yunzhong. The enemy has only invaded once, and Wei Shang led the chariots and horses to attack them, killing many of their soldiers. The soldiers are all from the countryside, joining the army, and do not know about the regulations of the military. They fight all day, cutting off heads and capturing enemies, reporting their achievements to the military office, and if there is a single word that does not match, the civil officials will punish them according to the law. The rewards are not given, but the law is strictly enforced. I am foolish and think that Your Majesty's law is too strict, the rewards too light, and the punishment too heavy. Moreover, the governor of Yunzhong, Wei Shang, was sentenced to a fine for a difference of six levels in the number of enemy heads he reported. Your Majesty sent him to the civil officials,剥夺了他的爵位，并处罚了他。 From this, it can be said that even if Your Majesty has Marquis Lianpi and General Li Mu, he won't be able to use them. I am truly foolish and have touched a taboo. I am guilty, guilty!" Emperor Xiaowen was pleased. That day, he ordered Feng Tang to hold the edict of pardon and restore Wei Shang to his position as the governor of Yunzhong, and appointed Tang as the Marquis of the Cavalry, in charge of the Middle Minister and the carriages of the provinces and kingdoms.

In the seventh year, Emperor Jing was enthroned, and Tang was appointed as the Chancellor of Chu, and was later demoted. When Emperor Wu was enthroned, he sought for virtuous and talented people and recommended Feng Tang. Tang was over ninety years old and could no longer serve in office, so he appointed his son Feng Su as a minister. Su, with the character name Wangsun, was also a remarkable person and was good friends with me.

The historian says: Zhang Ji's words about the elders are that they uphold the law without flattering; Feng Gong's discussion of generals is very thought-provoking! Very thought-provoking! It is said, 'If you don't know a person, look at his friends.' The two gentlemen' s praise can be inscribed in the hall of the temple. The Book of Documents says, 'Not biased, not partisan, the way of the king is serene; not partisan, not biased, the way of the king is smooth.' Zhang Ji and Feng Gong are close to this.
