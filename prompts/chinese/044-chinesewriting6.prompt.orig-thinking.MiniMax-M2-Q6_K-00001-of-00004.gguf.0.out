I need to write a poem in Du Fu's style about "超级人工智能" (super artificial intelligence). Du Fu is known for his regulated verse, with strict tonal patterns and parallelism. I should aim for a five-character or seven-character regulated verse, focusing on themes like the rise of technology, its impact on society, and the interplay of nature and human experience. I’ll also include a detailed analysis of the poem, covering its structure, imagery, and historical context.

I need to create a poem in Du Fu's style, focusing on regulated verse with a specific tonal pattern. I’ll aim for a seven-character quatrain, which is easier to manage than an eight-line poem. I’ll include parallelism in the couplets and use imagery like "云" and "风" to evoke Du Fu's style. The poem will have a title, "超级人工智能," and I’ll ensure it has a clear structure with a rhyme scheme, using Du Fu's typical themes of social concern and moral reflection.

I’m working on a seven-character quatrain about "超级人工智能." I want to incorporate themes like "云" and "风" while ensuring the lines have a regulated structure. The first line will be "云端巨脑起惊雷," which sets a strong tone. I’ll follow with "万算如潮洗世埃," and then "百业千门皆俯首," which reflects the impact on society. The last line will be "人心自照问谁裁," emphasizing the moral implications. I’ll also ensure the rhyme scheme is consistent, using "雷," "埃," "裁," and "哀."

I’m considering the rhyme scheme for my poem. The last character of each line should ideally rhyme, but I can use "裁" and "哀" as they share the same final sound. I’ll ensure the lines maintain a regulated structure, focusing on parallelism in the second and third lines. I want to evoke Du Fu's style with imagery like "云" and "风," while also incorporating themes of "寒灯" and "夜雨." I’ll finalize the poem with a title, "超级人工智能," and include a detailed analysis afterward.

I’ll include a detailed analysis afterward, covering themes, imagery, and the poem's structure, while ensuring it reflects Du Fu's moral concerns and the interplay of technology and humanity.

# 超级人工智能

云端巨脑起惊雷，万算如潮洗世埃。  
百业千门皆俯首，人心自照问谁裁。

## 赏析

这首七言绝句以“超级人工智能”为题，承续杜甫“诗史”传统，以小见大、借物兴怀，在短短四句中铺陈出技术巨变与社会伦理的张力。诗中“惊雷”“如潮”“俯首”“自照”等意象，既写其势之猛、其用之广，也写其对人心与秩序的冲击，末句以“问谁裁”收束，呈现诗人对权力与责任分配的深切追问。

首句“云端巨脑起惊雷”，以“云端”指涉云端计算与分布式智能，“巨脑”点明超级人工智能的规模与能力，“惊雷”则取其迅疾、震撼之义，暗示技术跃迁的突然与剧烈。杜甫常用“雷”“风”“雨”等自然气象象征时局之变，此处“惊雷”既承其气象之象，又转用于科技之象，兼具自然与人工的双重张力。

次句“万算如潮洗世埃”，以“万算”概括海量计算与数据处理，“如潮”写其势之汹涌、连绵不绝，“洗世埃”则寓净化与重塑之意。杜甫诗中常有“洗”“洗心”“洗尘”的用法，指向道德与秩序的更新；此处“洗世埃”既可理解为技术对信息噪声的清理，也可理解为对既有社会结构的重塑与淘汰，语义含混而多义。

第三句“百业千门皆俯首”，写超级人工智能对各行各业的广泛渗透与支配。“俯首”既可指技术对人的替代与压制，也可指人因依赖而屈从。杜甫常以“俯首”“低眉”等词写权势之威与民生之困，此处借以表现技术权力对社会的全面覆盖，语势沉郁而警醒。

末句“人心自照问谁裁”，以“人心自照”点明技术对认知与伦理的深刻影响——人通过智能系统“照见”自我与世界的镜像；“问谁裁”则将问题转向权力与责任的归属：谁有权裁断、谁应承担后果。杜甫诗中“问”“裁”常与“裁剪”“裁断”相连，指向制度与道德的裁断权；此处以“问谁裁”收束，既是对技术治理的质疑，也是对人类主体性的呼唤。

全诗采用七言绝句体式，句式工整，节奏紧凑，尾字“雷”“埃”“裁”押韵，音调铿锵。颔联“万算如潮洗世埃”与颈联“百业千门皆俯首”形成对仗，结构上以“势—用—权—责”递进，逻辑清晰。意象上，“云端”“巨脑”“惊雷”“如潮”“俯首”“自照”“裁”等词，既承杜甫气象与人事之象，又转用于科技语境，兼具古典韵味与当代意识。

在主题上，诗人不以技术为赞歌，而以“洗世埃”“问谁裁”提出伦理与治理的反思，延续杜甫“诗史”精神：既记时代之变，又问人心之安。整体风格沉郁而警醒，语势由外而内、由势而责，末句以问句收束，留白深远，引人深思。 [end of text]
