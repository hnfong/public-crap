<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer questions about a Chinese text from 滑稽列传 (a section of the "Shiji"? Actually "滑稽列传" is a chapter in "Shiji" by Sima Qian? Wait, "滑稽列传" is a chapter in "Shiji" about "滑稽" meaning "humorous"? Actually "滑稽列传" is a chapter about "滑稽" meaning "humorous" but also "滑稽" as "cunning"? Let's recall: In Shiji, there is a chapter "滑稽列传" about "滑稽" meaning "cunning, cunning people"? Actually "滑稽" in Shiji refers to "cunning, cunning people" (like "滑稽" meaning "cunning, cunning people" or "humorous"?). The chapter includes stories of people like "西门豹" (Ximen Bao), "子产" (Zichan), "子贱" (Zijian). The text above is a retelling of Ximen Bao's story about the "河伯娶妇" (River God marrying women). The story: Ximen Bao was the governor of Ye (邺). He discovered that the local people were suffering because of the practice of offering girls to the River God (河伯) for marriage. The practice involved sacrificing girls to the river, causing floods and poverty. Ximen Bao confronted the elders, the officials, and the priestess, and forced them to stop the practice. He also built irrigation channels to bring water to the fields. The story ends with praise for Ximen Bao.

We need to answer Q1: short summary (5 points). Provide concise summary.

Q2: What kind of women were usually the victims? The victims were young girls, especially those who were considered good-looking or "good" by the priestess, often daughters of families, or "good girls" (好女). They were often young, unmarried, or daughters of families. So answer: young girls, especially those considered good or beautiful, daughters of families.

Q3: Who were deemed to benefit from the old practice of offering girls? The practice benefited the "三老" (three elders), the "廷掾" (officials), the "巫祝" (priestess), the "河伯" (river god) and the "祝巫" (priestess). Also the "三老" and "官属" and "豪长者" and "里父老" (local elites). They collected money from the people, used it to pay for the river god's marriage, and kept the rest for themselves. So answer: the local elites, officials, priestesses, and the river god's cult.

Q4: Did the protagonist use wits or force to deal with the situation? Explain. Ximen Bao used both cunning and force. He used wits by confronting the elders, persuading them, and using rhetorical arguments. He also used force by ordering the priestess and the elders to be thrown into the river. He used a combination of moral persuasion and physical coercion. So answer: He used both.

Q5: Was it moral for the protagonist to do so? Provide views from various perspectives. Provide moral evaluation: from utilitarian perspective, he saved people from poverty and flood, so moral. From deontological perspective, he used violence and forced people to drown, which is morally questionable. From cultural perspective, he broke a tradition, but the tradition was harmful. So overall, many would view his actions as morally justified because he protected the people, but some might criticize the use of violence. Provide brief views.

Q6: At the end of 滑稽列传, it says: "傳曰：「子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。」三子之才能誰最賢哉？辨治者當能別之。" Explain what it means, and whether the comment is fair. This quote compares three wise men: Zichan (Zichan) who governed Zheng, Zijian who governed Danfu, and Ximen Bao who governed Ye. It says: "Zichan governed Zheng, the people could not be deceived; Zijian governed Danfu, the people could not endure deception; Ximen Bao governed Ye, the people could not dare to deceive." It praises their governance. The comment asks which of the three is most wise, and that a judge of governance should be able to distinguish. The fairness: each had different contexts; Zichan was known for honesty, Zijian for strictness, Ximen Bao for boldness. The comment is fair in that it acknowledges their distinct strengths, but the ranking is subjective. Provide explanation.

We need to keep answers concise. Provide points? The question says "5 points" etc. But we just need to answer concisely. Provide bullet points.

Let's craft answers.

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Q1 – Short summary (5 pts)**  
Ximen Bao, the governor of Ye, discovers that the local people are impoverished and threatened by floods because the “River‑God marriage” ritual forces the community to sacrifice young girls to the river. He confronts the elders, officials and the priestess, forces them to abandon the practice, and then builds irrigation channels to bring water to the fields. His reforms restore prosperity and earn him a lasting reputation.

**Q2 – Victim type (2 pts)**  
The victims were **young, unmarried girls**—especially those deemed “good” or “beautiful” by the priestess. They were usually daughters of ordinary families.

**Q3 – Beneficiaries of the old practice (2 pts)**  
The practice enriched the local **elite**: the three elders, the court officials (廷掾), the priestess (巫祝), and the surrounding aristocrats. They collected the tribute, used part of it to pay the River‑God’s “marriage,” and kept the rest for themselves.

**Q4 – Wits or force? (5 pts)**  
Ximen Bao used **both**:  
- **Wits** – he questioned the elders, exposed the hypocrisy of the ritual, and persuaded them to abandon it.  
- **Force** – he ordered the priestess, her disciples, and the elders to be thrown into the river, physically ending the practice.  
Thus his strategy combined moral argument with decisive coercion.

**Q5 – Moral assessment (10 pts)**  
- **Utilitarian view** – the policy saved thousands from poverty and flood, so it is morally justified.  
- **Deontological view** – the use of violence (drowning people) violates the duty to respect life, making it morally problematic.  
- **Cultural/Traditional view** – the ritual was a harmful superstition; breaking it was necessary, though the means were harsh.  
- **Historical perspective** – later scholars praise Ximen Bao for restoring order, suggesting that the ends (public welfare) outweighed the means.  
Overall, most commentators see his actions as morally defensible because they protected the populace, even if the methods were severe.

**Q6 – Meaning of the final quotation & fairness (15 pts)**  
> “傳曰：「子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。」三子之才能誰最賢哉？辨治者當能別之。”  

- **Interpretation** – The saying compares three wise rulers:  
  1. **Zichan** (治鄭) – his people could not be deceived.  
  2. **Zijian** (治單父) – his people could not tolerate deception.  
  3. **Ximen Bao** (治鄴) – his people could not dare to deceive.  
  It praises each for a distinct virtue: honesty, strictness, and boldness.  
- **Fairness** – The comment is fair in highlighting their different strengths, but it does not rank them; it merely invites a discerning judge to distinguish among them. Each operated under different circumstances, so a direct comparison is subjective. The remark is therefore balanced rather than biased. [end of text]
