This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

**[Story]**

The story takes place during the Tang dynasty, and it describes the life and the times of an official named Wu Zixu, also known as Wu Guangzhi, who lived during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. Wu Guangzhi is a respected and loyal official who serves under Emperor Xuanzong.

Wu Zixu is known for his skill and knowledge in governance. He has a deep understanding of the political landscape of the Tang dynasty and is a valued advisor to the emperor.

During the reign of Emperor Xuanzong, Wu Zixu is given a high position in the court. He is appointed the governor of the province of Huangcheng, which is located in the northwestern part of China.

Wu Zixu's role as the governor of Huangcheng involves overseeing the administration of the province and ensuring that the people are well-taken care of.

One day, Wu Zixu receives a letter from a group of villagers, asking for help in a dispute that has arisen between the villagers and the local government.

The villagers have been exploited by the local government, which has levied heavy taxes and taken away their land. They have been forced to work on behalf of the local government, but they have not been properly compensated or given the right to own their land.

Wu Zixu is determined to help the villagers and resolve the dispute peacefully. He meets with the local government officials and explains the situation, asking them to resolve the dispute in a fair and just manner.

The officials refuse to listen to Wu Zixu, and they continue to exploit the villagers. Wu Zixu is determined not to let the situation get any worse, and he decides to confront the local government officials one-on-one.

Wu Zixu approaches the local government official and challenges him to a duel. He tells the local government official that he will use his sword to defend his people, and he will use his wit to defend himself.

The local government official is reluctant at first, but Wu Zixu persuades him to join the duel. Wu Zixu and the local government official engage in a fight, which lasts for hours.

After the duel, Wu Zixu is impressed by the local government official's bravery and determination. The local government official, however, is not impressed by Wu Zixu's skill and knowledge in government.

Wu Zixu refuses to back down, and he continues to fight the local government official until both men fall to the ground. Wu Zixu then pins the local government official to the ground and binds his hands behind his back.

Wu Zixu then explains the situation to the people who were affected by the local government officials' actions. The people are overjoyed by Wu Zixu's actions, and they thank him for standing up for them.

As Wu Zixu and the local government official are being taken away by the soldiers, Wu Zixu is overjoyed. He says that he has done the right thing by standing up for the villagers, and he has achieved his goal of resolving the dispute peacefully.

Wu Zixu then leaves the duel and returns to the province of Huangcheng, where he continues to serve as the governor.

Wu Zixu's story is an inspiring example of a person who uses their skills and knowledge to stand up for the voiceless and oppressed. His actions help to restore justice and equality in his province, and he is a symbol of hope for the oppressed and exploited.
