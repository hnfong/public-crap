Q1: A summary of the story is that during the Wei dynasty, West Gate Leopard (西门豹) became the magistrate of Ye (邺). He learned that the people suffered due to a corrupt practice where local officials and shamans forced families to offer their daughters as brides to the river god, the He Bo, and then pocketed the money. West Gate Leopard cleverly dealt with the corrupt officials and shamans by pretending to follow the tradition but then had them thrown into the river. He then initiated a project to dig twelve canals to bring water to the people's fields, improving their lives.

Q2: The victims in the story were usually young, good-looking girls from poor families who were chosen by the shamans to be offered as brides to the river god, He Bo.

Q3: The local elders (三老), government officials (廷掾), and shamans (祝巫) were deemed to benefit from the old practice of offering girls. They collected money from the families and used a portion of it for their own gain, including keeping the rest of the money after the sham ritual of offering the girls to the river god.

Q4: The protagonist, West Gate Leopard, used wits rather than force to deal with the situation. He pretended to go along with the tradition, but instead of offering a girl, he had the corrupt officials and shamans thrown into the river. This clever strategy exposed their corruption without direct confrontation.

Q5: From a utilitarian perspective, it was moral for the protagonist to act as he did because he improved the lives of many by ending a corrupt practice and providing a sustainable water supply. From a legal perspective, his actions could be seen as extrajudicial and potentially problematic. From a Confucian perspective, his actions could be viewed as just, as he upheld the welfare of the people and maintained social order. However, some might argue that his methods were extreme and that a more lawful approach should have been taken. Overall, his actions were morally justifiable in the context of rectifying a grave injustice and improving the lives of his people.

Q6: The quote "傳曰：「子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。
