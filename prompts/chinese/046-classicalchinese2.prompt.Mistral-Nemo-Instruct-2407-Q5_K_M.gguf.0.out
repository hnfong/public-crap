This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

(1) **Translation:**

   Duke Wu of Wei was planning something and it was spot on. None of his ministers could keep up, and when he left the court, he had a look of joy on his face. Wu Qi stepped forward and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu?" Duke Wu asked, "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?" Wu Qi replied, "King Zhuang of Chu was planning something and it was spot on. None of his ministers could keep up, and when he left the court, he had a look of worry on his face. Gongsun Guishen stepped forward and asked, 'Your Majesty, you have a worried look after the court session, why is that?' King Zhuang said, 'I was planning something and it was spot on, none of my ministers could keep up. This is what the saying means: 'Those who can find a good teacher will become a king, those who can find a good friend will become a hegemon, those who can find someone to doubt their decisions will survive, and those who rely only on their own wisdom will perish.' Now, with my lack of talent, none of my ministers can keep up. My country is almost ruined! That's why I'm worried.' King Zhuang was worried, but you, my lord, are happy."

   Duke Wu of Wei was startled and bowed twice, saying, "Heaven has sent you, sir, to correct my mistakes."

(2) **Moral of the Story:** The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should not be overconfident in their own abilities and should value the advice of their ministers. A ruler who relies only on their own wisdom and does not listen to others is likely to make mistakes and bring harm to their country.

(3) **Counterpart in Western Thought:** The concept of a wise ruler valuing the advice of their ministers is present in Western thought as well. For example, in Aristotle's "Politics," he argues that a good ruler should be willing to listen to the advice of their counselors. Additionally, the idea that a leader who does not listen to others is likely to make mistakes is a common theme in Western political thought, appearing in works by authors such as Niccolò Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes.
