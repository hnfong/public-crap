We are asked to answer questions about the text from 滑稽列传. The text is in Chinese. The text is a story about West Gate Bao (西门豹) who was the magistrate of Ye (邺令) during the time of Wei Wenhou. The story describes a local custom where the local officials (three elders, the clerks, etc.) would collect money from the people and then use some of it to "buy" a bride for the river god (河伯) by selecting a girl from a poor family, dressing her up, and then sending her off to the river, where she is thrown into the river and eventually drowned. The story then describes how West Gate Bao, upon hearing the complaints of the people, pretends to participate in the ritual, but then mocks the process by sending the old witch and her disciples into the river, and then eventually sends the three elders into the river. The people are terrified, and then he stops the practice. Then he goes on to build irrigation canals to benefit the people. The story is a satirical account of local corruption and superstition, and how a clever official can reform the system.

Let's answer each question:

Q1: Give a short summary of the story (5 points)

We need to provide a summary of the story. The summary: "During the reign of Wei Wenhou, West Gate Bao was appointed as the magistrate of Ye. He discovered that the local officials were exploiting the people by collecting money and then using it to 'buy' a bride for the river god, which involved selecting a girl from a poor family, dressing her up, and then throwing her into the river to drown. The people were terrified of this practice, and many families hid their daughters to avoid being chosen. West Gate Bao decided to expose the absurdity of the ritual by participating in it and then mocking it, eventually sending the old witch and her disciples, and then the three elders, into the river. This act terrified the people and ended the practice. Afterwards, he built irrigation canals to benefit the people, and his reforms brought prosperity to the region. His actions earned him fame and respect."

I'll produce a summary in a concise manner.

Q2: What kind of women were usually the victims in the story (2 points)
