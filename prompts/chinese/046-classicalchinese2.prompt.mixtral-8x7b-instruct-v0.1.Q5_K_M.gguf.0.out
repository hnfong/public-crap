This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

 [/INST] (1) Translation:

Wei Wu Hou (King Hui of Wei) was pondering a matter and was about to succeed, but none of his officials were able to catch up to his idea. Upon retreating from court, he had a joyful expression. Wu Qi came forward and said, "Have you ever heard the words of the Zhou King of Chu?" Wei Wu Hou asked, "What did the Zhou King of Chu say?" Wu Qi replied, "The Zhou King of Chu was pondering a matter and was about to succeed, but none of his officials were able to catch up to his idea. Upon returning to his palace, he had a worried expression. The grand steward, Shi Gong Wu, asked, 'Your Majesty, why do you return with a worried expression?' The Zhou King of Chu said, 'If a ruler does not have virtuous ministers and yet achieves victory in war, if he does not have loyal allies and yet gains territory, if he has suspicious officials and yet remains safe, and if he plans on his own and no one can match him, then he will perish. Now, without virtuous ministers and yet achieving victory in war, and with no loyal allies and yet gaining territory, our country is on the brink of ruin. This is why I am worried.' Despite the Zhou King of Chu's worry, King Hui of Wei has joy.

Upon hearing this, King Hui of Wei walked around in circles, bowed twice, and said, "Heaven has sent this teacher to correct my mistakes."

(2) Moral of the story:

The moral of the story is that a ruler or leader should not become overly confident or joyful when they are able to achieve their goals without the help of others, especially their advisors and officials. This is because achieving success on one's own and not relying on others can lead to arrogance, and a lack of reliance on others can lead to a lack of trust. This can ultimately lead to the downfall of a ruler or leader. It is important for a ruler or leader to not only rely on their own abilities but also to value and trust their advisors and officials.

(3) Western counterpart:

The concept of a ruler or leader not becoming overly confident or joyful when they are able to achieve their goals without the help of others is also present in Western thought. For example, in Ancient Greek philosophy, the idea of hubris, or excessive pride and self-confidence, is often seen as a negative trait that can lead to downfall. Similarly, in Christian theology, pride is considered one of the seven deadly sins, and it is believed to be a source of evil and destruction. In both of these traditions, it is emphasized that humility and reliance on others is important for a leader or ruler to maintain their position and to avoid negative consequences.</s>
