This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

## Translation and Explanation of the Xunzi Passage

**(1) Translation:**

The story goes:

When Wei Wuhou was making plans, he was so decisive that no one else could keep up. After the court session, he had a look of joy on his face. Wu Qi stepped forward and said, "Have you ever heard the story of Chu Zhuang Wang?" Wei Wuhou asked, "What about Chu Zhuang Wang?" Wu Qi replied, "Chu Zhuang Wang was also decisive in his planning, leaving his ministers behind. After the court session, he had a look of worry on his face. Shen Gong Wu Chen asked him, 'Why are you worried after making such decisive plans?' Zhuang Wang said, 'I worry because I am not worthy of such decisiveness. My ministers cannot keep up, and this means my country is in danger. There is a saying: 'A ruler who makes his own army is a king, who makes his own friends is a hegemon, who makes his own enemies is one who survives, and who makes his own plans but cannot match himself is doomed.' Now, with my incompetence, yet my ministers cannot keep up, how can my country not be in danger! That is why I am worried.' Chu Zhuang Wang worried, but you, the ruler, are happy." Wei Wuhou hesitated and bowed again, saying, "Thank you, sir, for pointing out my shortcomings."

**(2) Moral of the Story:**

The story highlights the importance of humility and self-awareness in leadership. While Wei Wuhou's decisiveness is praised, his lack of concern for his ministers' abilities and the potential consequences of his actions is seen as a flaw. Chu Zhuang Wang, on the other hand, recognizes his own limitations and worries about the potential danger his decisiveness poses to his kingdom. The story suggests that true leadership involves not only making sound decisions but also understanding one's own strengths and weaknesses and being mindful of the impact of those decisions on others.

**(3) Western Counterparts:**

The concepts in the story have counterparts in Western thought, particularly in the philosophies of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle.

* **Socrates' emphasis on self-knowledge:** Socrates believed that true wisdom begins with recognizing one's own ignorance. This aligns with Chu Zhuang Wang's worry about his own competence despite his decisiveness.
* **Plato's theory of the ideal ruler:** Plato argued that the ideal ruler should possess both wisdom and justice. While Wei Wuhou might be seen as wise in his decision-making, he lacks the justice of considering the well-being of his subjects.
* **Aristotle's concept of virtue:** Aristotle believed that virtue is a necessary condition for happiness and flourishing. He emphasized the importance of cultivating virtues like humility, courage, and temperance. Chu Zhuang Wang's worry and self-reflection demonstrate a degree of humility and temperance that contrasts with Wei Wuhou's complacency.


The story of Wei Wuhou and Chu Zhuang Wang ultimately offers a timeless lesson about the importance of self-awareness, humility, and ethical leadership.
