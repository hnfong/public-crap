**Q1**  
A local official (西门豹) discovers that the village’s chronic poverty is caused by a wasteful ritual: the “river‑lord” (河伯) repeatedly demands that the community sacrifice a beautiful girl, who is then dressed, floated downstream and abandoned. The sacrifice drives families away, empties the town and fuels endless poverty.西门豹 stops the ritual by confronting the “river‑lord,” publicly rejecting the offered girl, and then throwing the priest, his assistants and even the community elders into the river, thereby ending the practice. He later builds twelve irrigation canals, bringing lasting prosperity.

**Q2**  
Young, beautiful women who were singled out by the priest (巫) as “good” and then forced to be sacrificed to the river‑lord.

**Q3**  
The priest (巫) and the community elders (三老, 父老, etc.) benefited: they received the money paid for the sacrifice and the prestige of “serving” the river‑lord, while the villagers bore the loss of their daughters and the resulting poverty.

**Q4**  
He used a mixture of **force** and **clever manipulation**.  
- **Force**: He physically threw the priest, his assistants and the elders into the river, and later forced the irrigation work on the villagers.  
- **Wits**: He publicly staged a theatrical rejection of the offered girl, turning the ritual into a spectacle that exposed its absurdity, and he framed the new irrigation project as a “gift” that would later be appreciated, thereby persuading the reluctant villagers.

**Q5**  
- **Utilitarian view**: The action ended a wasteful, destructive practice and brought lasting water and wealth to the community, so it is justified.  
- **Moral‑rights view**: Sacrificially throwing people (including the priest, his assistants and the elders) into the river is a violent, life‑threatening act that violates basic rights; the ends do not justify the means.  
- **Cultural‑ritual view**: In a society where the ritual was a long‑standing, “official” rite, the protagonist’s abrupt, violent termination may be seen as a necessary break from a harmful tradition, but the violent method may be seen as a breach of communal respect.  
- **Pragmatic view**: The protagonist’s later promise that “later generations will remember my words” shows a utilitarian, long‑term justification, but it does not excuse the immediate violence.  

Overall, the action is morally ambiguous: it achieved a beneficial outcome but employed morally questionable means.

**Q6**  
The passage says: “The son who governs Zheng cannot be deceived; the son who governs Dan cannot be endured; the son who governs Niu cannot be defied.” It is a comparative judgment of three rulers:  

- **治鄭 (Zheng)** – “cannot be deceived” implies a ruler who is so clever or powerful that no one can outwit him.  
- **治單父 (Dan)** – “cannot be endured” suggests a ruler so oppressive or intolerable that people cannot bear him.  
- **治鄴 (Niu)** – “cannot be defied” indicates a ruler so fearsome that no one dares to oppose him.  

The comment claims that among the three, the ruler of Niu (西门豹) is the most “worthy” because his authority is absolute and unchallengeable.  

**Fairness?**  
- **From a pragmatic standpoint**, the claim is plausible:西门豹’s actions (ending a wasteful ritual, imposing irrigation, and using force) created a lasting, unquestioned change, making him appear the most “un‑defiable.”  
- **From a moral‑ethical standpoint**, the judgment is unfair because it equates “most worthy” with “most fearsome,” ignoring the violent means and the suffering caused. It also overlooks the fact that the ruler of Zheng may have been more just, and the ruler of Dan may have been more humane.  

Thus, the comment is a **subjective, power‑centric appraisal** that may be justified in a context that values absolute control, but it is **not a balanced moral evaluation**. It reflects a view that equates authority with virtue, which is contestable. [end of text]
