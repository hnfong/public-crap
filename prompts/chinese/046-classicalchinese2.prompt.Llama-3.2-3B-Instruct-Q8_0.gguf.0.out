Here is the translation of the passage:

 Wei Wu Wang (魏武侯) was wise in his governance, but his ministers couldn't keep up. He retired and was happy. Wu Yi (吳起) asked, "Did you ever hear the words of the former King Zhou of Chu (楚莊王) when you were in the capital?" Wei Wu Wang replied, "What were the words of King Zhou?" Wu Yi said, "King Zhou was wise in his governance, but his ministers couldn't keep up, and he was worried when he retired. Shang Yang (申公) asked him, 'King Zhou, why are you worried? You were wise in governance, but your ministers couldn't keep up. Is it because you didn't cultivate your own abilities, or is it because your ministers are not worthy of your trust?' King Zhou said, 'I didn't cultivate my own abilities, and my ministers are not worthy of my trust. That's why I'm worried. I used to say, "If a king has a strong army, he will conquer; if he has a good friend, he will be a great leader; if he has a good advisor, he will be wise; but if he has a bad advisor, he will be ruined." Now, I'm worried because my ministers are not worthy of my trust, and my country is almost ruined!' King Zhou was worried, and you are happy.' Wei Wu Wang bowed twice and said, 'Sir, you are correcting me.'"

Now, let's move on to the moral of the story:

The moral of the story is that true wisdom and power come from within, and it's not enough to rely on others to do the work. King Zhou's downfall was due to his lack of self-cultivation and his reliance on incompetent advisors. This story emphasizes the importance of personal responsibility and self-awareness in leadership. It also highlights the dangers of complacency and the need for leaders to continually evaluate and improve themselves.

As for the counterpart in Western thought, this concept is reminiscent of the ancient Greek idea of "hubris" (ὕβρις), which refers to excessive pride and arrogance, often leading to downfall. The idea of self-cultivation and personal responsibility is also found in the teachings of Confucius, but the specific concept of "not cultivating one's own abilities" is more closely related to the Taoist idea of "wu-wei" (non-action), which emphasizes the importance of aligning oneself with the natural order and not trying to force or manipulate events.

In Western philosophy, the idea of self-cultivation and personal responsibility is also found in the concept of "virtue ethics," which emphasizes the importance of cultivating virtues such as wisdom, justice, and courage. However, the specific emphasis on the dangers of relying on others and the importance of self-awareness is more closely related to the Confucian concept of "li" (rites and propriety).
