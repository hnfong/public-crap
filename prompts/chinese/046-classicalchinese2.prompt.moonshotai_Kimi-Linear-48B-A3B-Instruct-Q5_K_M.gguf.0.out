(1) Translation of the passage:

Wei Houwu was deliberating on affairs and his decisions were correct; none of his ministers could match him. After leaving the court, he wore a look of satisfaction. Wu Qi stepped forward and said: "Has the words of King Zhuang of Chu ever been heard by Your Majesty?"

The Marquis of Wei asked: "What were the words of King Zhuang of Chu?"

Wu Qi replied: "When King Zhuang of Chu was deliberating on affairs and his decisions were correct, none of his ministers could match him. After leaving the court, he wore a look of worry. The Lord of She (Shen Gong Wuchen) asked him, 'When you enter the court and wear a look of worry, why is that?' The King said: 'I deliberate on affairs and my decisions are correct, yet none of my ministers can match me. This is why I am worried. It is as the saying goes: "When a ruler has teachers, he becomes a king; when he has friends, he becomes a hegemon; when he has doubts, he survives; when he schemes for himself and none can match him, he perishes." Now, because I am unworthy, and none of my ministers can match me, my state is almost in danger! This is why I am worried.' King Zhuang of Chu was worried, while Your Majesty is pleased."

The Marquis of Wei stepped back and bowed twice, saying: "May Heaven send this teacher to correct my faults."

(2) Moral of the story:

The story illustrates the importance of **humble self-reflection and the recognition of one's own limitations**. True wisdom lies not in the ability to outshine others, but in the awareness that one can always learn and improve. The ruler who is surrounded by capable ministers and yet remains humble and concerned about the future of the state is the one who will endure. Conversely, the ruler who is complacent and takes pride in his own brilliance is on the path to ruin. The story emphasizes the value of **seeking counsel, valuing the expertise of others, and maintaining a sense of responsibility and humility in leadership**.

(3) Counterparts in Western (European) thought:

The moral of the story resonates with several key concepts in Western philosophy and political thought:

- **Socratic Wisdom**: The idea that true wisdom begins with the recognition of one's own ignorance is central to Socratic philosophy. Socrates famously claimed that he was wise only because he knew that he knew nothing. This aligns with the Confucian idea of humility and the need for constant self-improvement.

- **Republicanism and Civic Virtue**: The emphasis on the ruler's concern for the state and the importance of surrounding oneself with capable and honest advisors is reminiscent of the Roman concept of *civitas* and the republican ideal of civic duty. Leaders are not above the state but are its servants.

- **The Prince by Machiavelli**: While Machiavelli's *The Prince* often advocates for cunning and self-reliance, it also acknowledges the importance of having wise advisors and the dangers of isolation. However, Machiavelli's approach is more pragmatic and less moralistic than the Confucian ideal.

- **Divine Right and the Limits of Power**: The story also touches on the idea that even rulers are not infallible and must be accountable. This is a precursor to later Western ideas about the limits of monarchical power and the importance of checks and balances.

- **The concept of *phronesis* (practical wisdom) in Aristotle**: Aristotle's concept of *phronesis*—practical wisdom—emphizes the importance of moral character and the ability to deliberate well about what is good for the community. The Confucian ideal of a ruler who is concerned with the welfare of the state and seeks counsel reflects this.

In summary, while the cultural context differs, the moral of the story aligns with Western ideas about humility, the importance of counsel, and the responsibilities of leadership. [end of text]
