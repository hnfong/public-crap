**Q1: Give a short summary of the story (5 points)**  
During the Warring States period, Ximen Bao became magistrate of Ye and discovered a corrupt practice: local officials and a witch exploited villagers by claiming they needed to offer a maiden to the river god Hebo. They extorted money and drowned young girls. Ximen Bao exposed the fraud by pretending to inspect the bride, then threw the witch and her disciples, followed by corrupt officials, into the river as "messengers" to Hebo. The scam ended. He later built twelve irrigation canals, bringing long-term prosperity. His wisdom and firm rule earned lasting respect.

**Q2: What kind of women were usually the victims in the story (2 points)**  
Young, good-looking daughters from poor families were targeted by the witch and taken by force to be "married" to the river god.

---

**Q3: Who were deemed to benefit from the old practice of offering girls? (2 points)**  
The village elders (*sanlao*), local officials (*tingyuan*), and the witch (*wuyu*) profited by embezzling most of the money collected from the people under the guise of the ritual.

**Q4: Did the protagonist use wits or force to deal with the situation? Explain (5 points)**  
Ximen Bao used **wits**, not brute force. He pretended to cooperate with the ritual, then cleverly turned it against the perpetrators—by claiming the bride was unfit and sending the witch and officials as messengers to the river god. His theatrical logic exposed the absurdity of the superstition and eliminated the corrupt without open rebellion, using their own beliefs to trap them.

**Q5: Was it moral for the protagonist to do so? Briefly provide views from various perspectives (10 points)**  

- **Legalist view**: Moral and justified—maintained order, punished corruption, and strengthened state control.  
- **Confucian view**: Ambiguous—while he served the people, killing (even indirectly) without trial may violate benevolence and due process.  
- **Utilitarian view**: Moral—his actions ended widespread suffering and saved future lives, maximizing public good.  
- **Human rights view**: Problematic—extrajudicial executions, even of corrupt figures, bypass justice and risk abuse.  
- **Popular view**: Highly moral—he liberated the people from oppression and was celebrated as a hero.

Thus, while effective and widely praised, his methods raise ethical questions about means versus ends.

**Q6: Explain the quote and whether the comment is fair (15 points)**  

The quote compares three virtuous officials:  
- **Zichan** (of Zheng): So capable that *people could not deceive him*.  
- **Zi Chan (Zi Chan of Shanfu)**: So virtuous that *people would not dare to deceive him*.  
- **Ximen Bao**: So authoritative that *people dared not deceive him*.  

It highlights different styles of governance: intelligence, moral influence, and威慑 (deterrence).  

**Fairness**: The comment is **fair and insightful**. It distinguishes types of effective rule. Zichan excelled in political acumen, Zixia (Zi Chan) in moral transformation, and Ximen Bao in strict, fear-based enforcement. Each suited their context. Ximen Bao’s “dare not” reflects his use of dramatic authority to crush entrenched corruption—appropriate for a chaotic, superstitious region. The comparison invites rulers to discern which virtue is most needed. It honors all three, suggesting true wisdom lies in recognizing their differences. [end of text]
