《張釋之馮唐列傳》

Zhang Tingwei Shi was from Duyang, and his courtesy name was Ji. He had an elder brother named Zhong who lived with him. He was appointed as a cavalry officer due to his wealth and served Emperor Xiaowen for ten years without being promoted, and he was not well-known. Zhang said, "Serving for a long time has reduced my brother Zhong's wealth, and it is not worth it." He wanted to resign and return home. The middle court commander Yuan Ang knew of his virtue and was sorry to see him leave, so he requested that Zhang be transferred to serve as a receptionist. After Zhang had finished his audience, he stepped forward to discuss matters of state. Emperor Xiaowen said, "Lower your tone, do not speak too highly, but rather suggest what can be implemented now." Thus, Zhang spoke about the affairs between the Qin and Han dynasties, explaining why the Qin lost power and the Han gained it. Emperor Xiaowen praised him and appointed Zhang as the chief receptionist.

Zhang accompanied the emperor to the tiger enclosure. The emperor asked the chief warden of the Shanglin Park about the records of various animals, asking over ten questions. The warden looked around and could not answer any of them. A low-ranking official from the tiger enclosure answered the emperor's questions about the animal records in great detail, trying to show his ability to respond quickly and fluently. The emperor said, "Should officials not be like this? The warden is unreliable!" He then ordered Zhang to appoint the low-ranking official as the chief warden of Shanglin Park. Zhang stepped forward after a long pause and said, "Your Majesty, what do you think of Zhou Bo of Jianghou?" The emperor replied, "He is a man of integrity." Zhang asked again, "What do you think of Zhang Xiangru of Dongyang?" The emperor replied again, "He is a man of integrity." Zhang said, "Jianghou and Dongyang are called men of integrity, yet these two men find it difficult to express themselves. How can they be compared to this low-ranking official who speaks fluently and quickly? Moreover, the Qin dynasty appointed officials who were skilled in writing and administration, and they competed to be quick and strict, but their flaws were merely superficial, lacking genuine compassion. Therefore, they did not hear of their faults and gradually declined until the second generation, leading to the collapse of the empire. Now, if Your Majesty appoints this low-ranking official to a higher position because of his eloquence, I fear that the whole country will follow suit, competing in eloquence without substance. Moreover, the influence of the ruler on the people is as swift as a shadow, so every action must be carefully considered." The emperor said, "Well said." He then decided not to appoint the low-ranking official.

The emperor got into his carriage and called Zhang to ride with him, moving slowly. He asked Zhang about the flaws of the Qin dynasty. Zhang spoke frankly. Upon arriving at the palace, the emperor appointed Zhang as the chief of the imperial carriage office.

Not long after, the crown prince and the king of Liang entered the palace together in a carriage and did not dismount at the Sima Gate. Zhang stopped them from entering the palace and impeached them for disrespect for not dismounting at the Sima Gate. Empress Dowager Bo heard of this, and Emperor Xiaowen removed his hat and apologized, saying, "I did not teach my children well." Empress Dowager Bo then sent an envoy to pardon the crown prince and the king of Liang, allowing them to enter. Emperor Xiaowen was impressed by Zhang and appointed him as a senior official.

Not long after, Zhang was promoted to the rank of middle court commander. He accompanied the emperor to Baling and stood on the north side of a toilet. At that time, Lady Shen was present, and the emperor pointed out the road to Xinfeng to her, saying, "This is the road to Handan." He asked Lady Shen to play the zither, and the emperor sang along, feeling sad and melancholic. He then said to his ministers, "Alas! If the coffin is made of stone from the northern mountain, lined with hemp and silk, and sealed with lacquer, how could it be moved?" Everyone said, "Well said." Zhang stepped forward and said, "If there is something desirable inside, even if the mountain is sealed, there will still be a gap. If there is nothing desirable inside, even without a stone coffin, why should one be concerned?" The emperor praised him. Later, Zhang was appointed as the chief justice.

Not long after, the emperor was traveling on the Zhongwei Bridge when a man ran out from under the bridge, startling the imperial carriage's horse. The emperor then ordered the cavalry to capture the man and hand him over to the chief justice. Zhang questioned the man, who said, "I am from the county. I heard the imperial procession was coming and hid under the bridge. After a long time, I thought the procession had passed, so I came out and saw the imperial carriage, and I ran." The chief justice, according to the law, ruled that the man had violated the imperial procession and should be fined. The emperor was angry and said, "This man personally startled my horse. Fortunately, my horse is gentle; otherwise, it might have injured me. But the chief justice only fined him!" Zhang replied, "The law is what the Son of Heaven shares with the people. If the law is changed to be more severe, the people will no longer trust it. At the time, if the emperor had ordered him to be executed on the spot, it would have been fine. Now that the case has been handed over to the chief justice, the chief justice is the balance of justice for the whole country. If this case is handled improperly, it will affect the fairness of the law, and the people will not know what to do. Please consider this, Your Majesty." After a long pause, the emperor said, "The chief justice's ruling is correct."

Later, someone stole a jade ring from the front of the Gao Temple. The thief was captured, and the emperor was angry and ordered the chief justice to handle the case. Zhang, according to the law, ruled that the theft of imperial items should be punished by public execution. The emperor was furious and said, "How can someone be so lawless as to steal from the temple of the previous emperor? I entrusted the case to the chief justice because I wanted the thief to be executed with his clan. But you ruled for public execution, which does not align with my intention to honor the temple." Zhang removed his hat and bowed, saying, "The law as it stands is sufficient. Moreover, crimes are categorized by severity. If the theft of temple items results in clan execution, and if a commoner were to take a handful of soil from Changling, how would Your Majesty punish him?" After a long pause, the emperor discussed the matter with Empress Dowager Bo and agreed with the chief justice's ruling. At that time, the middle court commander Zhou Yafu and the prime minister of Liang, Wang Tiankai, saw that Zhang's arguments were fair and became his friends. Zhang, the chief justice, was thus praised throughout the country.

After Emperor Xiaowen died and Emperor Jing ascended the throne, Zhang was afraid and claimed illness. He wanted to resign but feared severe punishment; if he wanted to apologize, he did not know how. Following the advice of Wang Sheng, he eventually apologized, and Emperor Jing did not punish him.

Wang Sheng was skilled in the teachings of Huang-Lao and was a hermit. He was once summoned to the court, where the three dukes and nine ministers were all present. Wang, an old man, said, "My sock has come loose," and he turned to Zhang, the chief justice, and said, "Tie my sock for me!" Zhang knelt and tied it. Afterward, someone asked Wang, "Why did you humiliate Zhang, the chief justice, by making him tie your sock in court?" Wang replied, "I am old and of low status, and I do not think I can benefit Zhang. Zhang is a renowned official in the country, so I humiliated him by making him tie my sock to show respect for him." The ministers heard this and respected Wang and Zhang.

Zhang served Emperor Jing for over a year and was appointed as the prime minister of Huainan, still harboring past grievances. After a long time, Zhang died. His son, Zhang Zhi, whose courtesy name was Changgong, became an official but was dismissed. Because he could not adapt to the world, he never held office again.

Feng Tang's great-grandfather was from Zhao. His father moved to Dai. When the Han dynasty was established, they moved to Anling. Feng Tang was known for his filial piety and served as the head of the middle court office under Emperor Xiaowen. When the emperor's carriage passed by, he asked Feng Tang, "Why are you an official? Where is your home?" Feng Tang answered truthfully. The emperor said, "When I was in Dai, my food supervisor Gao Qu often spoke to me about the virtues of the Zhao general Li Qi, who fought at Julu. Now, every time I eat, I think of Julu. Do you know about this?" Feng Tang replied, "Even Li Qi is not as good as Lian Po and Li Mu." The emperor asked, "Why?" Feng Tang said, "My great-grandfather, when he was in Zhao, was a general and knew Li Mu well. My father was once the prime minister of Dai and knew the Zhao general Li Qi, so he knew his character." The emperor, having heard about Lian Po and Li Mu, was pleased and slapped his thigh, saying, "Alas! If only I could have Lian Po and Li Mu as my generals, I would not worry about the Xiongnu!" Feng Tang said, "Your Majesty! Even if you had Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them." The emperor was angry and left the court. After a long time, he summoned Feng Tang and said, "Why did you humiliate me in public? Could you not have done it in private?" Feng Tang apologized, saying, "I am a simple man and do not know how to avoid offending you."

At that time, the Xiongnu had recently invaded Chaona and killed the governor of Beidi, Ang. The emperor, concerned about the Xiongnu, asked Feng Tang again, "Why do you think I cannot use Lian Po and Li Mu?" Feng Tang replied, "I have heard that in ancient times, when a king appointed a general, he would kneel and push the chariot, saying, 'Within the gate, I will manage it; outside the gate, the general will manage it. All military achievements and rewards will be decided outside, and reported upon return.' This is not just empty talk. My great-grandfather said that when Li Mu was a general in Zhao, the taxes from the military market were used to treat the soldiers, and rewards and punishments were decided outside, without interference from the center. He was entrusted with responsibility and held accountable for success, so Li Mu could fully utilize his intelligence, deploying 1,300 chariots, 13,000 cavalry, and 100,000 elite soldiers. He drove away the Chanyu to the north, defeated the Donghu, destroyed the Danlin, suppressed the powerful Qin to the west, and supported Han and Wei to the south. At that time, Zhao was almost a hegemon. Later, when King Qian of Zhao ascended the throne, his mother was a singer. King Qian, influenced by Guo Kai's slander, eventually executed Li Mu and replaced him with Yan Ju. As a result, the army was defeated, and the soldiers fled, leading to Zhao's destruction by Qin. Now, I have heard that Wei Shang, the governor of Yunzhong, used the taxes from the military market to treat his soldiers, and he spent his own money to provide oxen for the soldiers every five days, treating guests, military officers, and attendants. Therefore, the Xiongnu avoided Yunzhong and did not approach its borders. When the Xiongnu once invaded, Wei Shang led his chariots and cavalry to attack them, killing many. The soldiers were all from families, and they joined the army from the fields. They did not know the military regulations. After a day of fighting, they would cut off heads and capture prisoners, and report their achievements to the commandery. If one word did not match, the clerks would enforce the law. The rewards were not given, but the clerks strictly enforced the law. I am foolish, but I think Your Majesty's laws are too strict, the rewards are too light, and the punishments are too severe. Moreover, Wei Shang, the governor of Yunzhong, was demoted six ranks for a minor discrepancy in his report, and Your Majesty handed him over to the clerks, stripped him of his rank, and punished him. From this, it can be seen that even if Your Majesty had Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them. I am indeed foolish and have offended you, I am guilty, I am guilty!" The emperor was pleased. On that day, he ordered Feng Tang to hold the imperial seal and pardon Wei Shang, restoring his position as the governor of Yunzhong, and appointed Feng Tang as the commander of the chariots and cavalry, overseeing the middle court and the chariots of the commanderies and states.

In the seventh year, Emperor Jing ascended the throne and appointed Feng Tang as the prime minister of Chu, but he was later dismissed. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne, he sought virtuous men and recommended Feng Tang. At that time, Feng Tang was over ninety years old and could no longer serve as an official, so he appointed Feng Tang's son, Feng Sui, as a court official. Feng Sui's courtesy name was Wangsun, and he was also an extraordinary man, and he was friendly with me.

The Grand Historian said: Zhang Ji's words about men of integrity, adhering to the law without favoritism; Feng Gong's discussion of generals, is truly insightful! Truly insightful! It is said, "If you do not know a person, look at his friends." The praise of these two men can be inscribed in the temple. The Book says, "Do not be partial or biased, the royal way is broad and straight; do not be biased or partial, the royal way is smooth and easy." Zhang Ji and Feng Gong are close to this.
