## Answers to Questions about 滑稽列传:

**Q1: Short Summary (5 points)**

The story recounts how Westmen Bao, the magistrate of Ye, abolished the exploitative practice of sacrificing young girls to the river god. He cleverly exposed the deception by throwing the witch, her disciples, and the local officials into the river, effectively ending the tradition and bringing prosperity to the people through irrigation projects.

**Q2: Victims (2 points)**

The victims were usually young, unmarried girls from poor families.

**Q3: Beneficiaries (2 points)**

The beneficiaries of the old practice were the local officials, the witch, and her disciples who profited from the extortion and the ritual.

**Q4: Wits or Force? (5 points)**

Westmen Bao used a combination of both wits and force. He employed wit by feigning belief in the ritual and orchestrating a public spectacle to expose the deception. He then used force by throwing the perpetrators into the river, effectively ending the practice.

**Q5: Morality (10 points)**

The morality of Westmen Bao's actions is debatable.

* **Arguments for:** He saved countless young girls from being sacrificed and brought prosperity to the people through irrigation. His actions were arguably necessary to end a harmful and exploitative practice.
* **Arguments against:** Some might argue that his methods were brutal and lacked due process. Throwing people into the river, regardless of their actions, could be seen as excessive and unjust.

Ultimately, the morality of his actions depends on one's perspective on the balance between justice, expediency, and the sanctity of human life.

**Q6: Comparison of Three Officials (15 points)**

The passage at the end of 滑稽列传 compares Westmen Bao to Zichan and Zizhi, stating that the people of their respective domains were unable, unwilling, or dared not deceive them. It then asks who among the three was the wisest.

This comment highlights the effectiveness of each ruler's governance. It suggests that true wisdom lies not just in intelligence but also in the ability to inspire trust and obedience from the people.

Whether the comment is fair is debatable. While all three rulers were undoubtedly effective, their contexts and challenges differed. Comparing them solely based on the people's obedience might overlook other crucial aspects of good governance, such as social welfare, economic development, and long-term stability.

Ultimately, judging who was the "wisest" requires a more nuanced analysis considering various factors beyond mere obedience. [end of text]
