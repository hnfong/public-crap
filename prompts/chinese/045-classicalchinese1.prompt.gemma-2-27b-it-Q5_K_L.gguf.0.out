魏文侯时，西门豹为邺令。豹往到邺，会长老，问之民所疾苦。长老曰：「苦为河伯娶妇，以故贫。」豹问其故，对曰：「邺三老、廷掾常岁赋敛百姓，收取其钱得数百万，用其二三十万为河伯娶妇，与祝巫共分其余钱持归。当其时，巫行视小家女好者，云是当为河伯妇，即娉取。洗沐之，为治新缯绮縠衣，闲居斋戒；为治斋宫河上，张缇绛帷，女居其中。为具牛酒饭食，行十余日。共粉饰之，如嫁女床席，令女居其上，浮之河中。始浮，行数十里乃没。其人家有好女者，恐大巫祝为河伯取之，以故多持女远逃亡。以故城中益空无人，又困贫，所从来久远矣。民人俗语曰『即不为河伯娶妇，水来漂没，溺其人民』云。」西门豹曰：「至为河伯娶妇时，愿三老、巫祝、父老送女河上，幸来告语之，吾亦往送女。」皆曰：「诺。」

至其时，西门豹往会之河上。三老、官属、豪长者、里父老皆会，以人民往观之者三二千人。其巫，老女子也，已年七十。从弟子女十人所，皆衣缯单衣，立大巫后。西门豹曰：「呼河伯妇来，视其好丑。」即将女出帷中，来至前。豹视之，顾谓三老、巫祝、父老曰：「是女子不好，烦大巫妪为入报河伯，得更求好女，后日送之。」即使吏卒共抱大巫妪投之河中。有顷，曰：「巫妪何久也？弟子趣之！」复以弟子一人投河中。有顷，曰：「弟子何久也？复使一人趣之！」复投一弟子河中。凡投三弟子。西门豹曰：「巫妪弟子是女子也，不能白事，烦三老为入白之。」复投三老河中。西门豹簪笔磬折，向河立待良久。长老、吏傍观者皆惊恐。西门豹顾曰：「巫妪、三老不来还，柰之何？」欲复使廷掾与豪长者一人入趣之。皆叩头，叩头且破，额血流地，色如死灰。西门豹曰：「诺，且留待之须臾。」须臾，豹曰：「廷掾起矣。状河伯留客之久，若皆罢去归矣。」邺吏民大惊恐，从是以后，不敢复言为河伯娶妇。

西门豹即发民凿十二渠，引河水灌民田，田皆溉。当其时，民治渠少烦苦，不欲也。豹曰：「民可以乐成，不可与虑始。今父老子弟虽患苦我，然百岁后期令父老子孙思我言。」至今皆得水利，民人以给足富。十二渠经绝驰道，到汉之立，而长吏以为十二渠桥绝驰道，相比近，不可。欲合渠水，且至驰道合三渠为一桥。邺民人父老不肯听长吏，以为西门君所为也，贤君之法式不可更也。长吏终听置之。故西门豹为邺令，名闻天下，泽流后世，无绝已时，几可谓非贤大夫哉！

## Answers to Questions about 滑稽列传:

**Q1: Give a short summary of the story (5 points)**

The story recounts how Westmen Bao, the magistrate of Ye, stopped the exploitative practice of sacrificing young girls to the river god. He exposed the corruption of local officials who profited from this ritual and used a clever ruse to end it, ultimately bringing prosperity to the people by building irrigation canals.

**Q2: What kind of women were usually the victims in the story (2 points)**

The story implies that young, unmarried girls, often from poor families, were the victims of this practice.

**Q3. Who were deemed to benefit from the old practice of offering girls? (2 points)**

The corrupt local officials (three elders, court officials, and sorcerers) benefited from the practice, using the money collected for the ritual to enrich themselves.

**Q4: Did the protagonist use wits or force to deal with the situation? Explain (5 points)**

Westmen Bao used a combination of both wits and implied force. He cleverly pretended to support the ritual, luring the officials and sorcerers into a trap by throwing them into the river. This implied threat of violence, combined with his public exposure of their corruption, effectively ended the practice.

**Q5: Was it moral for the protagonist to do so? Briefly provide views from various perspectives (10 points)**

This is a complex ethical question with no easy answer.

* **Utilitarian perspective:** Westmen Bao's actions were morally justifiable as they saved countless lives and brought prosperity to the people. The ends (saving lives and improving welfare) justified the means (deception and implied threat).
* **Deontological perspective:** Some might argue that Westmen Bao's methods were unethical, as they involved deception and potentially harming the officials. They might believe in a strict adherence to moral rules, regardless of the consequences.
* **Cultural relativism:** One could argue that judging Westmen Bao's actions through a modern moral lens is inappropriate. We must consider the context of his time and the prevailing beliefs and practices.

Ultimately, the morality of Westmen Bao's actions is a matter of personal interpretation and depends on one's ethical framework.

**Q6: At the end of 滑稽列传, it is said that: "傳曰：「子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。」三子之才能誰最賢哉？辨治者當能別之。" -- explain what it means, and whether the comment is fair. (15 points)**

This passage compares three virtuous officials: Zichan of Zheng, Zizhi of Shanfu, and Westmen Bao of Ye. It highlights how each leader instilled such trust and respect in their people that they were not subjected to deceit or disrespect. The passage then poses a question: who among these three was the wisest? It challenges the reader to analyze and differentiate their respective merits.

Whether the comment is fair depends on one's interpretation of "wisdom."

* **Zichan:** Known for his administrative skills and economic reforms, he focused on creating a just and prosperous society.
* **Zizhi:** Emphasized moral leadership and personal integrity, inspiring his people through his own exemplary conduct.
* **Westmen Bao:** Demonstrated courage and ingenuity in tackling corruption and improving the lives of his people.

Each leader possessed unique strengths and contributed to the well-being of their respective states. It is difficult to definitively rank them as "wisest" as their approaches and contexts differed. The passage encourages a nuanced understanding of leadership and acknowledges the diverse ways in which wisdom can manifest.
