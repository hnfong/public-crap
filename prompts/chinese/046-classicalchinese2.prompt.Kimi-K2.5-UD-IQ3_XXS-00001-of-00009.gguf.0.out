## (1) English Translation

Marquis Wu of Wei planned affairs appropriately, and none of his ministers could match him. When he left court, he had a pleased expression. Wu Qi advanced and said: "Has Your Majesty ever heard from your attendants the words of King Zhuang of Chu?" The Marquis said: "What were the words of King Zhuang of Chu?" Wu Qi replied: "King Zhuang of Chu planned affairs appropriately, and none of his ministers could match him. When he left court, he had a worried expression. Shen Gong Wuchen came forward and asked: 'Why does Your Majesty have a worried expression after court?' The King said: 'I planned affairs appropriately, and none of my ministers could match me—this is why I worry. As the saying in the *Zhonglu* states: "A ruler who finds a teacher among the nobles becomes a true king; one who finds a friend becomes a hegemon; one who finds someone to question him survives; one who plans for himself and finds none to match him will perish." Now, with my lack of virtue, and none of my ministers able to match me—my state is nearly doomed! This is why I worry.' King Zhuang of Chu worried, yet Your Majesty rejoices." Marquis Wu hesitated, then bowed twice and said: "Heaven has sent you, Master, to correct my fault."

## (2) The Moral of the Story

The moral is that **a ruler's superiority over his ministers is actually a cause for concern, not celebration**. True political wisdom lies in:

- **Surrounding oneself with equals or superiors**: The hierarchy of rulership depends on having advisors who can challenge, question, and improve upon one's decisions
- **Self-awareness of limitation**: The best rulers recognize their own inadequacy and actively seek correction
- **The danger of intellectual isolation**: When no one can match the ruler, the state drifts toward ruin because there is no check on error, no source of better counsel

The passage from *Zhonglu* (中蘬) establishes a clear hierarchy: finding a teacher leads to kingship, a friend to hegemony, someone who questions you to survival, while self-sufficiency in counsel leads to destruction.

## (3) Western Counterparts

Yes, several strong parallels exist:

**Classical Greek thought:**
- **Socrates' intellectual humility**: "I know that I know nothing" — the recognition of ignorance as the beginning of wisdom
- **Plato's philosopher-king**: Though the ideal ruler is wise, Plato emphasizes dialectic and the testing of ideas through dialogue with others
- **Aristotle on friendship**: In the *Nicomachean Ethics*, he argues that the good person needs friends of equal virtue for self-knowledge and improvement—"friends hold up a mirror to each other"

**Roman/Stoic thought:**
- **Cicero on counsel**: In *De Officiis* and elsewhere, Cicero emphasizes that rulers must seek and heed advice, and that flattery (having no one who can match you) destroys states
- **Seneca on the need for critics**: Advisors who speak unpleasant truths are essential to good governance

**Early Modern thought:**
- **Machiavelli's *Discourses***: Explicitly argues that republics survive through institutionalized conflict and multiple counsel—having one superior decision-maker is dangerous
- **Montesquieu's separation of powers**: Institutionalized checks on any single will

**Christian/Monastic tradition:**
- The concept of *obedience* and *spiritual direction*—even abbots and kings needed confessors and advisors who could correct them

The most precise parallel is perhaps **Xenophon's *Cyropaedia*** and the Greek ideal of **parrhesia** (frank speech)—the obligation of advisors to speak truth to power, and the good ruler's obligation to welcome it. The *Zhonglu* hierarchy resembles Aristotle's analysis of political friendship in *Politics* Book 3, where the best constitution depends on relations between unequals structured toward mutual improvement.

However, the specific formulation—that finding someone *better than yourself* is the condition of true kingship—is perhaps more systematically developed in Chinese thought than in the Western tradition, where the autonomous individual will (even in politics) carries somewhat more prestige.
