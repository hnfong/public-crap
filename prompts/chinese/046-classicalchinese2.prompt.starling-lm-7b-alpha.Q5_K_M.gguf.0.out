This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

Here's the English translation of the story:

When Duke of Wei was plotting, no one could catch up with him. After leaving the palace, he was showing a smile. Duke of Wu asked: "Is there a saying in the state of Chu about a duke like this?" Wei Duke said: "What is the saying in Chu about a duke like that?" Duke of Wu said: "A duke in Chu is plotting and no one can catch up with him, but he is showing a sad face. When the minister Zilu asked: "Why is the duke showing sadness?" The duke said: "If the duke is plotting and no one can catch him, he is showing sadness because the duke is afraid that no one is as wise as he is and that his state will be destroyed. The old Duke of Zhou said: 'The rulers are the ones who win wars, the hegemons are the ones who win friends, and the ones who survive are those who can be distrusted. The wise duke, who has no one who can follow him, will be ruined. That is why he is sad.' The duke of Chu is sad, but the lord is happy." Duke of Wei walked around and bowed again and said, "The heavens help the wise in improving their weaknesses."

Here's the moral of the story:
The moral of the story is that a ruler should not be overly confident in his own wisdom and abilities, as this can lead to a lack of trust in his subjects and ultimately to his own downfall. The duke of Chu's sadness stemmed from his own insecurities and fear of his own downfall, rather than the actual actions of the lord.

Does the concept have a counterpart in Western (European) thought?
Yes, the concept has a counterpart in Western thought. In particular, it is reflected in the teachings of Sun Tzu, an ancient Chinese military strategist, in his work "The Art of War." Sun Tzu emphasized the importance of deception and misdirection as a means of achieving victory. He also stressed the importance of not being overly confident in one's own abilities, as this can lead to complacency and a lack of preparedness.

In Western philosophy, a similar concept is found in the works of the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates. Socrates believed that the unexamined life was not worth living, and that one should always be questioning one's own beliefs and assumptions. This idea is closely related to the concept of humility and self-awareness, which are key to preventing overconfidence and the associated pitfalls.

In addition, the moral of the story is also reflected in the Christian teaching of humility. In the Bible, Jesus teaches his followers to be humble and not to seek their own glory. This is a key aspect of Christian ethics, and it is believed that humility is a necessary quality for a leader, as it allows them to recognize their own weaknesses and to be open to learning from others.

Overall, the concepts in the story of Duke of Wei's plotting and the duke of Chu's sadness have a broad range of counterparts in both Eastern and Western thought, reflecting the universal importance of humility, self-awareness, and the dangers of overconfidence.
