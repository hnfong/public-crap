This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

### (1) Translation of the Story into English

The story is about Wei Wu侯, a ruler, who made a wise decision, and his ministers were unable to match it. After returning from court, he had a smile on his face. Wu Qi, a minister, asked him, "Have you ever heard the words of King Chu Zang Wang?" Wei Wu侯 replied, "What were the words of King Chu Zang Wang?" Wu Qi answered, "King Chu Zang Wang made a wise decision, and his ministers were unable to match it. After returning from court, he had a worried look on his face. Shen Gong Wuxi asked him, 'Why are you worried, Your Majesty?' King Chu Zang Wang said, 'I made a wise decision, and my ministers were unable to match it, so I am worried. There is a saying in the middle of the pond, 'Whoever becomes the teacher of the world is a king, whoever becomes the friend of the world is a hegemon, whoever becomes the object of suspicion is a survivor, and whoever makes their own decisions and is not inferior to themselves is a loser.' Now that I, with my lack of talent, have my ministers unable to match me, is our country about to be destroyed? That is why I am worried.' King Chu Zang Wang was worried, but Your Majesty was happy." Wei Wu侯 hesitated and then bowed twice, saying, "Your Excellency has corrected my mistake."

### (2) Explanation of the Moral of the Story

The moral of the story is that success and failure are not just about making wise decisions, but also about the perception of those decisions. Wei Wu侯 was happy because he thought his decision was wise and that his ministers were unable to match it. However, King Chu Zang Wang was worried because he thought his decision was wise but that his ministers were unable to match it, and he feared for the future of his country. The story highlights the importance of self-awareness and the need to consider the impact of one's actions on others.

### (3) Counterpart in Western (European) Thought

The concept of self-awareness and the impact of one's actions on others is present in Western thought, particularly in the philosophy of Immanuel Kant. Kant's concept of the "categorical imperative" emphasizes the importance of acting in a way that one would want everyone else to act in similar situations. This concept is similar to the idea in the story that one's actions have consequences and that one should be aware of the impact of those actions on others. Additionally, the concept of "moral relativism" in Western thought suggests that what is considered right or wrong can vary depending on the context and the perspective of the individual. This concept is also present in the story, as the perception of the decision made by Wei Wu侯 and King Chu Zang Wang was different, leading to different emotional responses. [end of text]
