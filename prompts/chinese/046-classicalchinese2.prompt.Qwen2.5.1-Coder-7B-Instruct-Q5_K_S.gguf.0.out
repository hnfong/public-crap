### Translation of the Story into English

The Duke of Wei was planning a matter and did it well, but none of his ministers could match him. When he returned from court, he had a smile on his face. Wu Qi approached and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Chu?" The Duke of Wei asked, "What were the words of King Chu?" Wu Qi replied, "King Chu planned a matter and did it well, but none of his ministers could match him. When he returned from court, he had a worried look on his face. Shen Gong Wuxian approached and asked, 'Your Majesty, why do you have a worried look?' King Chu said, 'I am worried because I planned a matter and did it well, but none of my ministers could match me. The saying in the middle of the pond is that 'a king who makes others his teachers becomes a king, a king who makes others his friends becomes a hegemon, a king who makes others his doubts remains, and a king who makes no one else his match becomes a king who perishes.' Now that I, a king who is not wise, have none of my ministers who can match me, is our country about to perish? That is why I am worried.' The Duke of Wei was worried, but you are happy." The Duke of Wei hesitated and bowed twice, saying, "I am grateful to Teacher for correcting my mistakes."

### Moral of the Story

The moral of the story is that success and happiness do not necessarily go hand in hand. While the Duke of Wei was pleased with his own success, Wu Qi pointed out that the Duke's happiness was misplaced. The Duke had become complacent and overconfident in his own abilities, which led to a false sense of security. The story emphasizes the importance of humility, continuous learning, and the need to remain vigilant and aware of potential threats or weaknesses.

### Counterpart in Western Thought

The concept of the "middle of the pond" (中蘬之言) in the story reflects a philosophical idea that is somewhat similar to the concept of "hubris" in Western thought. Hubris refers to excessive pride or arrogance that leads to one's downfall. The story warns against becoming too complacent and overconfident, which can lead to a false sense of security and ultimately to one's downfall. This idea is present in various Western philosophical and literary works, such as the Greek tragedy "Oedipus Rex" by Sophocles, where the protagonist's hubris leads to his downfall. [end of text]
