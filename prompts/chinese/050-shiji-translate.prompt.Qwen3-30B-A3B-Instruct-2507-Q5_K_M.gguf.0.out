"Biography of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang"

Zhang Tingwei Shizhi was from Duyang, his courtesy name was Ji. He had an elder brother named Zhong who lived with him. He was appointed as a cavalry officer due to his wealth, serving Emperor Xiao Wen. For ten years he was not promoted, and thus remained unknown. Shizhi said, "Having served for so long, my elder brother's assets have diminished, and my ambitions have not been fulfilled." He wished to resign and return home. The Chief Commander Yuan Ang, aware of his virtue, regretted his departure and thus requested that Shizhi be transferred to serve as a messenger. After Shizhi had completed his audience, he stepped forward and spoke of matters of practical benefit. Emperor Wen said, "Speak humbly; do not make lofty arguments. Let your words be applicable to the present situation." Thus Shizhi spoke at length about events between the Qin and Han dynasties, explaining why the Qin had fallen and the Han had risen. Emperor Wen praised him, and appointed Shizhi as Deputy Chief Messenger.

Shizhi accompanied the emperor on a tour and ascended to the Tiger Enclosure. The emperor asked the Supervisor of the Royal Forests about the inventory of wild animals, posing more than ten questions. The supervisor looked around, unable to answer any of them. The supervisor's assistant, standing nearby, answered all the questions in detail, attempting to demonstrate his quick-wittedness and ability to respond instantly. Emperor Wen said, "Is it not the duty of an official to be like this? The supervisor is useless!" He then ordered Shizhi to appoint the assistant as Supervisor of the Royal Forests. Shizhi stepped forward and said, "Your Majesty, what do you think of Lord Jiaoling Zhou Bo?" The emperor replied, "He is a man of integrity." Then he asked again, "What about Dongyang Marquis Zhang Xiang?" The emperor replied, "He is also a man of integrity." Shizhi said, "Now, both Lord Jiaoling and Dongyang Marquis are regarded as men of integrity, yet when they speak, they cannot even utter a word clearly. How could they possibly match this assistant, who speaks so fluently and swiftly? Moreover, the Qin dynasty relied on clerks who handled legal documents, and officials competed in being swift, harsh, and meticulous in their scrutiny. But their shortcomings were merely formalities; they lacked genuine compassion. Thus, the Qin dynasty never heard of its own faults, declined gradually, and collapsed under the second emperor, leading to the destruction of the entire realm. Now, Your Majesty promotes this assistant solely because of his eloquence, and I fear that the entire world will follow suit, competing in clever speech while lacking substance. Moreover, the influence of the ruler spreads faster than shadows in sunlight. Therefore, every action must be carefully considered." Emperor Wen said, "Well said." He then stopped the appointment of the assistant.

The emperor climbed into his carriage, summoned Shizhi to ride beside him, and slowly drove forward. He asked Shizhi about the weaknesses of the Qin dynasty. Shizhi answered in full, speaking with sincerity. Upon returning to the palace, Emperor Wen appointed Shizhi as Chief of the Palace Gate Guards.

Shortly afterward, the Crown Prince and Prince Liang rode together into court, failing to dismount at the Sima Gate. Shizhi pursued them and stopped them from entering the palace gate. He then formally accused them of failing to dismount at the public gate, a breach of respect, and submitted the report. Upon hearing this, Empress Dowager Bo said, "The emperor has failed to properly educate his sons." She then sent an envoy to deliver her decree, pardoning the Crown Prince and Prince Liang, after which they were allowed to enter. Emperor Wen thus regarded Shizhi as exceptional and appointed him as a Middle Minister.

Shortly afterward, he became Chief Commander. When accompanying the emperor to Ba陵, they stopped at a place facing the toilet to the north. At that time, Lady Shen was with them. The emperor pointed toward the Xinfeng road and said, "This is the route to Handan." He had Lady Shen play the zither, and he himself leaned on the zither and sang, his mood sorrowful and melancholy. Looking back at his ministers, he said, "Alas! If I were to use stone from the northern mountain as a coffin, line it with hemp and cotton, and coat the gaps with lacquer, would it ever be moved?" All around replied, "Excellent." Shizhi stepped forward and said, "If there were something desirable within, even if sealed with the southern mountain, there would still be a way to break through. If there were nothing desirable within, even without a stone coffin, what would one have to fear?" Emperor Wen praised him. Later, he appointed Shizhi as Grand Minister of Justice.

Not long after, the emperor was traveling and passed through Zhong Weiqiao. A man suddenly emerged from under the bridge, causing the emperor’s horse to startle. The emperor ordered cavalry to capture him and handed him over to the Grand Minister of Justice. Shizhi investigated and questioned him. The man said, "I am a local resident. I heard the imperial procession approaching and hid beneath the bridge. After a long time, I thought the procession had passed, so I came out. Seeing the emperor’s carriage and attendants, I fled in fear." The Grand Minister of Justice judged according to the law: one who disturbed the imperial procession should be fined. Emperor Wen became angry and said, "This man directly startled my horse. Fortunately, my horse was gentle. If it had been another horse, would it not have thrown me and injured me? Yet the Grand Minister of Justice only recommends a fine!" Shizhi said, "The law is something the emperor shares with the entire realm. If the law is now made stricter, it will lose credibility among the people. Moreover, at the moment, if Your Majesty had wanted him executed, you could have done so immediately. Now that he has been handed over to the Grand Minister of Justice, the Grand Minister of Justice is the arbiter of justice for the entire realm. If he sways even slightly, then the entire realm’s application of the law will become arbitrary. Where would the people know how to place their hands and feet? I beg Your Majesty to consider this carefully." After a long silence, the emperor said, "The Grand Minister of Justice is correct."

Later, someone stole a jade ring from the altar of the High Temple. He was captured, and Emperor Wen was furious, ordering the Grand Minister of Justice to try him. Shizhi examined the law and reported that stealing sacred objects from the ancestral temple should be punished by public execution. Emperor Wen became extremely angry and said, "This man is utterly depraved—he steals relics from the former emperor’s temple. I entrusted you with this case so that you would have him executed along with his family, yet you only apply the law. This is not in line with my intention to uphold the ancestral temple." Shizhi removed his hat and bowed deeply, saying, "The law as it stands is sufficient. Even if the crimes are equal, the severity depends on the circumstances. If we execute someone for stealing temple relics, and suppose there is a one-in-ten-thousand chance that a foolish commoner digs up a handful of earth from Changling, how would you punish him?" After a long time, Emperor Wen discussed this with Empress Dowager Bo, and finally agreed with the Grand Minister of Justice’s judgment. At that time, the Chief Military Commissioner Tiao Hou Zhou Yafu and the Marquis of Liang, Shan Du Hou Wang Tian Kai, saw that Shizhi’s judgments were fair and impartial, and thus became close friends with him. From then on, Zhang Tingwei was widely praised throughout the realm.

After Emperor Wen’s death, Emperor Jing ascended the throne. Shizhi feared for his life and claimed illness. He wished to resign, fearing severe punishment; yet he also hesitated to appear and apologize, unsure of how the emperor would react. Following the advice of Wang Sheng, he finally appeared to apologize, and Emperor Jing did not punish him.

Wang Sheng was skilled in the teachings of Huang-Lao, and was a recluse. Once, he was summoned to serve in the court, where all the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers stood in attendance. Wang Sheng, an old man, said, "My sock has come undone," and turned to Zhang Tingwei, saying, "Tie my sock for me!" Shizhi knelt and tied it for him. Afterward, someone said to Wang Sheng, "Why did you publicly humiliate Zhang Tingwei, making him kneel to tie your sock?" Wang Sheng replied, "I am old and lowly. I knew I could never benefit Zhang Tingwei in any way. Zhang Tingwei is now a renowned minister of the realm. I deliberately humiliated him to make him kneel, in order to elevate his status." When the ministers heard this, they respected Wang Sheng and held Zhang Tingwei in high regard.

Zhang Tingwei served Emperor Jing for over a year, then became Governor of Huainan, still bearing the stigma of his earlier incident. After a long time, Shizhi died. His son was Zhang Zhi, whose courtesy name was Changgong. He served as a Grand Minister but was dismissed. Because he could not conform to the ways of the world, he never held office again for the rest of his life.

Feng Tang was originally from Zhao. His grandfather had moved to Dai. After the founding of the Han dynasty, they relocated to Anling. Feng Tang was known for his filial piety and served as Chief of the Middle Palace Guard under Emperor Wen. Once, as the emperor’s carriage passed by, he asked Feng Tang, "Old man, how did you become an official? Where is your home?" Feng Tang answered truthfully. Emperor Wen said, "When I lived in Dai, my Chief of the Imperial Kitchen, Gao Qu, often spoke to me of the virtue of Zhao general Li Qi, who fought at Julu. Now, whenever I eat, my thoughts are never far from Julu. Do you know of him?" Feng Tang replied, "He is not as good as Lian Po or Li Mu." The emperor asked, "Why?" Feng Tang said, "My grandfather served as a general in Zhao, and was close to Li Mu. My father served as Governor of Dai and was close to Zhao general Li Qi, so I know their characters." After hearing about Lian Po and Li Mu, Emperor Wen was greatly pleased and struck his thigh, saying, "Alas! If only I could have lived in the time of Lian Po and Li Mu, and had them as my generals, would I have any worries about the Xiongnu?" Feng Tang said, "Your Majesty, even if you had Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them." The emperor became angry and left for the inner palace. After a long time, he summoned Feng Tang and rebuked him, saying, "How could you publicly humiliate me? Was there no private place?" Feng Tang apologized, saying, "I am a simple man, unaware of what is taboo."

At that time, the Xiongnu had recently launched a major invasion of Chaona, killing the Northern Region Governor Ang. The emperor was deeply concerned about the Xiongnu threat, and finally asked Feng Tang again, "How do you know I cannot use Lian Po and Li Mu?" Feng Tang replied, "I have heard that in ancient times, when a king sent a general to war, he would kneel and push the chariot forward, saying: 'Within the gate, I govern; beyond the gate, the general governs.' Military achievements, ranks, and rewards were decided by the general in the field, and only reported upon return. This is not mere talk. My grandfather said that when Li Mu served as general in Zhao, he used the revenue from the military market to feed his soldiers, and rewards were decided outside the capital, not interfered with from within. With full trust and responsibility, Li Mu was able to fully utilize his talents, assembling 1,300 chariots, 13,000 archers, and 100,000 elite soldiers. Thus he drove back the Xiongnu, defeated the Donghu, destroyed the Danlin, checked the powerful Qin to the west, and resisted Han and Wei to the south. At that time, Zhao was nearly dominant. Later, when King Zhao Zhi ascended the throne, his mother was a courtesan. After King Zhi took the throne, he listened to the slander of Guo Kai, and ultimately executed Li Mu, replacing him with Yan Ju. As a result, the army was defeated, the soldiers fled, and Zhao was captured and destroyed by Qin. Now I have heard that Wei Shang, the Governor of Yunzhong, uses all the revenue from the military market to feed his soldiers and officers. He spends his own money to slaughter a cow every five days to entertain guests, officers, and subordinates. Thus the Xiongnu keep their distance and do not approach the Yunzhong border. When the enemy once entered, Wei Shang led his chariots and cavalry to attack, killing many. The soldiers are all sons of commoners, drawn from the fields to join the army. How would they know about military records or regulations? They fight all day, kill enemies, capture prisoners, and report their achievements to the command post. Yet if their report does not match the form exactly, the clerks will punish them according to the law. Rewards are not given, but the law is strictly enforced. I am simple-minded, but I believe Your Majesty’s law is too strict, rewards too light, and punishments too severe. Moreover, Governor Wei Shang was punished for reporting six fewer enemy heads than required, and was stripped of his rank and sentenced to forced labor. If this is the case, even if Your Majesty had Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them. I am truly foolish, and have offended your taboos. I am guilty, guilty!" Emperor Wen was pleased. That day, he ordered Feng Tang to carry the imperial seal and pardon Wei Shang, restoring him as Governor of Yunzhong, and appointed Feng Tang as Commander of the Cavalry, overseeing the Chief Military Commissioner and the cavalry of the commanderies and states.

Seven years later, Emperor Jing ascended the throne, and Feng Tang became Governor of Chu, but was later dismissed. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne, he sought virtuous and capable men, and recommended Feng Tang. Feng Tang was already over ninety years old and could no longer serve in office. Thus, he appointed Feng Tang’s son, Feng Sui, as a Palace Guard. Sui’s courtesy name was Wangsun. He was also a remarkable man, and was on good terms with Yu Shan.

Sima Qian said: Zhang Ji’s words were those of a man of integrity, adhering to the law without bending to personal wishes. Feng Gong’s discourse on generals and commanders was profound—profound indeed! The saying goes, "If you do not know a man, look at his friends." The praise bestowed upon these two men is worthy of being inscribed in the halls of government. The Book of Documents says: "Not biased, not partial—this is the broad path of kingship; not partial, not biased—this is the smooth path of kingship." Zhang Ji and Feng Gong come close to this ideal.
