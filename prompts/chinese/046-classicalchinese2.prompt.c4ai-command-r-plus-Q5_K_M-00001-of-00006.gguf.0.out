魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

*Wei武侯 (Wei Wuhou) had just concluded a successful strategy session with his ministers, who were unable to match his brilliant plans. He returned from the meeting with a pleased expression on his face. Wu Qi (吴起), one of his advisers, stepped forward and asked, "Your Highness, have you ever heard the story of Chu莊王 (King Chuang of Chu) that is often told among your attendants?" Intrigued, Wei Wuhou asked, "What did King Chuang of Chu say?" Wu Qi then recounted the story: "After a similar incident, King Chuang of Chu also displayed remarkable insight during a strategic discussion, leaving his ministers far behind. However, unlike you, Your Highness, he returned with a worried expression. When Shen Gong Wu Chen (申公巫臣) inquired about his concern, King Chuang of Chu replied, 'I worry because my insight surpasses that of my ministers. According to the words of the sage Zhong Ypi (中蘬), "A ruler who has wise teachers will become a king, one who has loyal friends will become a hegemon, one who has doubtful friends will merely survive, and one who plans alone and has no peers will perish." Now, as an unworthy ruler, if my understanding surpasses that of my ministers, how close is our state to ruin!' That, Your Highness, is why King Chuang of Chu worried while you rejoice."*

Hearing this, Wei Wuhou was taken aback and immediately showed reverence. He bowed twice and said, "It is by your grace, Master Wu Qi, that I recognize my mistake."*

(2) Moral of the Story:

The story emphasizes the importance of surrounding oneself with capable and wise advisers and recognizing the potential pitfalls of pride and self-satisfaction. Wei Wuhou initially took pride in his superior strategic abilities, but Wu Qi's reminder of King Chuang of Chu's anecdote served as a humbling lesson. It highlights that true wisdom lies in understanding one's limitations and the value of diverse and competent counsel. The moral of the story encourages rulers (or leaders in a broader sense) to remain vigilant, seek improvement, and value the input of their advisers to avoid potential downfall.

(3) Counterpart in Western Thought:

The concept presented in the story indeed has counterparts in Western European thought. One notable example is the idea of a "council of advisors" or a "cabinet," which has been an integral part of governance in many Western democracies. This concept recognizes the value of diverse perspectives and expertise in decision-making. Additionally, the Greek concept of "hubris," which refers to excessive pride or self-confidence, aligns with the moral of the story. Hubris often leads to a downfall, as individuals or leaders who exhibit hubris lose touch with reality and fail to recognize their limitations. Plato's "Republic" also discusses the importance of ruling with wisdom and the idea that a just ruler should surround himself with wise and virtuous advisers.<|END_OF_TURN_TOKEN|>
