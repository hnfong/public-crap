Q1: A magistrate named West Mountain Leopard, serving as the prefect of Luoyang, investigates the hardships of the people and discovers that they are suffering due to the practice of offering girls to the river god. He cleverly exposes the deceitful old men who exploit this tradition, leading to the cessation of the practice and the improvement of the people's lives.

Q2: The victims were usually young girls who were offered to the river god as a sacrifice to appease him.

Q3: The old men and the river god were the ones who benefited from the old practice of offering girls.

Q4: The protagonist used wits to deal with the situation. He cleverly exposed the deceitful old men by pretending to offer a girl to the river god himself, leading to their capture and the cessation of the practice.

Q5: The morality of the protagonist's actions can be viewed from various perspectives. From a utilitarian perspective, his actions led to the greater good of the people, improving their lives and ending a harmful practice. From a deontological perspective, his actions could be seen as manipulative and deceitful, as he used trickery to achieve his goals. However, considering the context and the suffering of the people, his actions could be seen as morally justified.

Q6: The comment states that "Zi Carun governed Zheng and the people could not deceive him; Zi Xian governed Yan and the people could not deceive him; West Mountain Leopard governed Luoyang and the people did not dare to deceive him." It suggests that all three men were capable leaders, but West Mountain Leopard was the most effective in preventing deceit among his people. The comment is fair as it acknowledges the different leadership styles and effectiveness of the three men. [end of text]
