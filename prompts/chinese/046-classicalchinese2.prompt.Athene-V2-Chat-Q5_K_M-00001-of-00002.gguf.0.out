This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

### (1) Translation of the Story

Wei Wu Hou was discussing matters and made a correct decision, which none of his ministers could match. After the court session, he had a pleased look on his face. Wu Qi approached and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu mentioned by those around you?" Wu Hou replied, "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?" Wu Qi responded, "When King Zhuang of Chu made a correct decision and none of his ministers could match it, he had a worried look on his face after the court session. Shen Gong Wu Chen approached and asked, 'Why do you look worried after the court session?' King Zhuang replied, 'I made a correct decision, and none of my ministers could match it, which is why I am worried. As it was said by Zhong Gong, "Those who can find a teacher among the feudal lords will become kings; those who can find a friend will become hegemonic; those who can find someone to challenge them will survive; but those who plot on their own and think no one can match them will perish." Now, with my lack of ability, none of my ministers can match me, so our state is close to ruin! That is why I am worried.' King Zhuang of Chu was worried, while you are pleased." Wei Wu Hou hesitated and then bowed twice, saying, "The heavens have sent you to correct my mistake."

### (2) Moral of the Story

The moral of the story is that true leadership and wisdom lie in recognizing one's own limitations and the value of having advisors who can challenge and improve upon one's decisions. King Zhuang of Chu's worry stems from the realization that if he is the only one making correct decisions, it indicates a lack of capable advisors, which is a sign of potential downfall. In contrast, Wei Wu Hou's initial pleasure at being the best decision-maker shows a lack of self-awareness and a potential overconfidence, which Wu Qi points out as a flaw. The story emphasizes the importance of humility, self-reflection, and the need for diverse and critical input in governance.

### (3) Counterpart in Western (European) Thought

The concepts in this story have several counterparts in Western thought, particularly in the realms of philosophy, leadership, and governance. Here are a few examples:

1. **Socratic Method and Intellectual Humility**: Socrates, the ancient Greek philosopher, often emphasized the importance of recognizing one's own ignorance and the value of questioning and dialogue. The Socratic method involves engaging in critical discussion to refine and test ideas, much like the story's emphasis on the need for advisors who can challenge and improve decisions.

2. **Aristotle's Virtue of Phronesis (Practical Wisdom)**: Aristotle's concept of phronesis, or practical wisdom, involves the ability to make sound judgments and decisions in practical matters. This virtue is closely tied to the idea of having good advisors and being open to their input, as it requires a leader to be both knowledgeable and humble.

3. **Leadership and the Importance of a Diverse Advisory Council**: In Western political thought, the idea of a diverse and competent advisory council is well-established. For example, the Roman Republic's system of multiple magistrates and the Senate was designed to prevent any single individual from having unchecked power and to ensure that decisions were well-considered and balanced.

4. **Modern Management Theory**: Contemporary management theory also emphasizes the importance of creating a culture of open communication, where leaders are not afraid to be challenged and where diverse perspectives are valued. This aligns with the story's message about the dangers of overconfidence and the benefits of having a team that can provide critical feedback.

In summary, the story's themes of humility, self-reflection, and the value of diverse input are deeply resonant with various strands of Western thought, from ancient philosophy to modern management practices. [end of text]
