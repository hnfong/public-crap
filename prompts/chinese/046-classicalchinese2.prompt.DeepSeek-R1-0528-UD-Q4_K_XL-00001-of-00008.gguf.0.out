Okay, the user has shared a passage from Xunzi and asked for three things: an English translation, the moral of the story, and whether similar concepts exist in Western thought. 

First, I need to carefully translate this classical Chinese text. The story features Marquis Wu of Wei looking pleased after a successful court session, which Wu Qi criticizes by recounting how King Zhuang of Chu reacted to the same situation with concern. The key is preserving the philosophical nuance in translation - especially phrases like "得師者王" (gaining teachers leads to kingship) and the layered dialogue structure.

Hmm, the moral seems to be about leadership humility. King Zhuang's anxiety over having no ministers who could surpass him reveals profound wisdom - true rulers should surround themselves with people smarter than themselves. That's why Wu Qi uses this parable to chastise the marquis's pride. 

For Western parallels... immediately Socrates comes to mind with his "I know that I know nothing." Then there's Seneca criticizing flatterers, and Machiavelli's advice about heeding counselors. The Biblical proverb about pride preceding destruction fits perfectly too. Interesting how both Eastern and Western traditions converge on this leadership principle.

The user might be studying comparative philosophy or preparing for a class. They asked clearly but concisely - probably someone familiar with Chinese texts given they didn't need background on Xunzi. I'll structure the response with numbered sections as requested, keeping explanations accessible but academically rigorous. Should emphasize that Wu Qi's intervention isn't just criticism but salvation - hence the marquis calling him "heaven-sent."

Here's the complete response to your request:

**(1) English Translation:**

Marquis Wu of Wei was making plans for state affairs, and they were all fitting/appropriate. None of his ministers could match his ability. After retiring from court, he wore a pleased expression.
Wu Qi approached and said, "Has Your Majesty perhaps heard the saying of King Zhuang of Chu reported to you?"
Marquis Wu asked, "What was King Zhuang of Chu's saying?"
Wu Qi replied, "King Zhuang of Chu was making plans for state affairs, and they were all fitting/appropriate. None of his ministers could match him. After retiring from court, he wore a worried expression. Minister Shen Gong Wu Chen approached and asked, 'Your Majesty retires from court with a worried expression. Why is this?' King Zhuang said, 'Because *I* devise plans that are fitting, and none of my ministers can match me, *this* is why I worry. There is a saying recorded in the *Zhong Hui*: "A feudal lord who gains teachers for himself becomes a true king; one who gains friends becomes a hegemon; one who gains those who question him survives; but one who acts solely on his own counsel, with no one his equal, will perish." Now, with someone as unworthy as myself, yet none of my ministers can surpass me, is my state not close to perishing? This is why I worry.' King Zhuang of Chu worried over this, yet Your Lordship is pleased."
Marquis Wu hesitated, stepped back, and bowed twice, saying, "Heaven has sent you, Master, to awaken me to my fault."

**(2) Moral of the Story:**

The core moral is **the critical importance of humility, receptiveness to criticism, and surrounding oneself with capable advisors for effective and sustainable leadership.**

*   **Danger of Complacency & Arrogance:** Marquis Wu's initial pleasure at outshining his ministers reveals dangerous complacency and arrogance. He mistakes his own temporary success for inherent superiority and fails to see the long-term peril of having no one to challenge or improve his ideas.
*   **Wisdom in Recognizing Limitations:** King Zhuang, in contrast, demonstrates profound wisdom. He understands that a ruler who cannot find ministers smarter or more capable than himself is in grave danger. His worry stems from recognizing his own limitations and the state's vulnerability if he is the sole source of wisdom.
*   **Value of Advisors:** The quoted saying categorizes advisors: "Teachers" (superior wisdom), "Friends" (equal partners), and "Questioners" (those who challenge). All are valuable; the worst position is having none who can match or surpass you ("莫己若者" - "no one like oneself"). True strength lies in leveraging the talents of others.
*   **Openness to Correction:** Marquis Wu's ultimate reaction – hesitation, stepping back, bowing, and acknowledging his fault – shows the ideal response: recognizing the criticism's validity and being grateful for the correction. This openness is essential for growth and avoiding disaster.

**In essence:** A wise leader actively seeks out and values advisors who are smarter, more capable, or at least willing to challenge them. Relying solely on one's own judgment and being pleased when no one surpasses you is a path to failure and ruin. Humility and the ability to listen are paramount virtues of leadership.

**(3) Counterparts in Western Thought:**

Absolutely, the core concepts in this story have strong parallels in Western philosophical, political, and ethical traditions:

1.  **Socratic Wisdom & Humility:** The most direct parallel is Socrates' famous dictum: "I know that I know nothing." True wisdom, for Socrates, begins with recognizing one's own ignorance. King Zhuang's worry embodies this Socratic humility, contrasting sharply with Marquis Wu's initial (and dangerous) certainty. The value of questioning and seeking knowledge from others is central to the Socratic method.
2.  **Plato's Philosopher-King & Counsel:** While Plato's ideal ruler is supremely wise, the *process* of ruling in the *Republic* involves dialectic and reasoned discussion. The danger of the tyrant, who rules solely by his own will without counsel or law, is a major theme. The story's warning against the ruler with "no one his equal" resonates with Plato's critique of tyranny.
3.  **Aristotle on Friendship & Deliberation:** Aristotle emphasized the importance of friendship (*philia*) in political life and the necessity of deliberation (*bouleusis*) involving multiple perspectives for making good decisions in the *Nicomachean Ethics* and *Politics*. The categories of "friends" (霸 *bà*, hegemon) and "questioners" (存 *cún*, survive) align with Aristotle's ideas about collaborative reasoning.
4.  **Roman Stoicism (Seneca, Marcus Aurelius):** Stoics like Seneca frequently warned against the corrupting influence of flattery and the importance of having true friends who offer honest criticism (*parrhesia*). Marcus Aurelius, in his *Meditations*, constantly reminds himself of his own fallibility and the need to learn from others. King Zhuang's attitude reflects this Stoic humility and vigilance.
5.  **Machiavelli's *The Prince*:** While often associated with ruthlessness, Machiavelli strongly advises the Prince to choose wise counselors, listen to them frankly, and crucially, to *be able to tolerate the truth* from them. He warns that a prince surrounded only by flatterers is doomed. This directly mirrors Wu Qi's warning and King Zhuang's insight.
6.  **Biblical Wisdom:** Proverbs in the Bible repeatedly warn against pride and emphasize the value of counsel: "Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall" (Proverbs 16:18), and "Plans fail for lack of counsel, but with many advisers they succeed" (Proverbs 15:22). The story's moral aligns perfectly with this ancient wisdom.

**Conclusion:** The core message of Xunzi's story – that true leadership requires humility, the active seeking of superior or challenging advisors, and the rejection of self-satisfied isolation – is a universal theme deeply embedded in Western philosophical and political thought, from ancient Greece and Rome through the Renaissance and beyond. The specific categorization of advisors and the stark warning against the ruler who stands alone find clear echoes in Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, Machiavelli, and Biblical wisdom.
