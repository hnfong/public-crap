**Biography of Zhāng Shìzhī and Féng Táng**

Zhāng Shìzhī, originally from Dūyáng, was known by the courtesy name of Jì. He had an elder brother, Zhōng, who lived with him. Zhāng was appointed as a minor official and served as a *qíláng* (cavalry attendant) under Emperor Wén of the Hàn. For ten years, he did not receive a promotion and gained no reputation. Zhāng said, "Serving in office for so long has depleted my brother’s property, and I cannot continue." He wished to resign and return home. The *zhōnglángjiàng* (middle general) Guāng Yáng heard of his virtue and regretted his departure, so he petitioned to transfer Zhāng to the position of *yèzhě* (attendant). After Zhāng finished his morning audience, he approached the emperor and spoke on matters of convenience. Emperor Wén said, "Lower your tone, and do not speak too loftily. Your words should be practical and immediately applicable." Zhāng then spoke of the affairs between the Qín and Hàn dynasties, explaining why Qín declined and Hàn prospered at length. Emperor Wén praised him, and Zhāng was appointed as *yèzhě fúshǎo* (supervisor of attendants).

Zhāng accompanied the emperor to the *Hǔquān* (Tiger Cage). The emperor questioned the *Shànglín yù* (supervisor of the imperial gardens) about the records of birds and beasts, asking more than ten questions. The supervisor looked around helplessly and could not answer any of them. A *sèfū* (warden of the imperial gardens) from the side answered the emperor’s questions about the birds and beasts thoroughly, apparently to observe whether he could speak fluently and respond endlessly. Emperor Wén said, "Officials should not be like this! The supervisor is worthless!" He then ordered Zhāng to promote the warden to the position of *Shànglín lǐng* (supervisor of the imperial gardens). Zhāng had previously asked the emperor, "How do you regard the noble *Jǐnghóu Zhōu Bó*?" The emperor replied, "He is a man of integrity." Zhāng then asked, "How do you regard *Dōngyánghóu Zhāng Xiàng*?" The emperor again replied, "He is a man of integrity." Zhāng said, "The noble *Jǐnghóu* and *Dōngyánghóu* are both men of integrity, yet neither of them could speak a word when matters were discussed. How could this warden, who is clever and quick-witted, be compared to them? Moreover, Qín relied on bureaucrats who were skilled in legal documents, and officials competed to be more harsh and meticulous in their investigations. However, their flaws were merely superficial, lacking any genuine compassion. Thus, their misdeeds went unnoticed, and their neglect led to the collapse of the dynasty. Now, if you promote this warden simply because he is eloquent, I fear that people across the country will follow the wind, competing to be eloquent without substance. Moreover, the influence of the lower ranks on the upper is swift like the reflection of light; therefore, such decisions must be carefully considered." Emperor Wén agreed and did not promote the warden.

The emperor boarded his carriage and summoned Zhāng to ride beside him. They traveled slowly, and the emperor questioned Zhāng about the decline of Qín. Zhāng responded in detail. Upon arriving at the palace, the emperor appointed Zhāng as *Gōngchē lǐng* (supervisor of public carriages).

Soon after, the Crown Prince and the Prince of Liáng shared a carriage to attend court, but they did not dismount at the *Sīmǎ mén* (Palace Gate). Zhāng pursued and stopped them, preventing them from entering the palace gates. He then accused them of disrespect for not dismounting at the public gate and reported the matter. Empress Dowager Bó heard of this and Emperor Wén, removing his hat, apologized, saying, "I have not properly instructed my son." Empress Dowager Bó then sent an envoy to carry out the emperor’s pardon for the Crown Prince and Prince of Liáng, allowing them to enter. Emperor Wén thereafter admired Zhāng and appointed him as *zhōngdàfū* (middle minister).

Soon after, Zhāng was promoted to the position of *zhōnglángjiàng* (middle general). He accompanied the emperor to the *Bàlíng* mausoleum and stood to the north of the latrine. At that time, *Shǎnfū* was with the emperor, who pointed out the *Xīnfēng* road to her and said, "This is the route to Hándān." He had *Shǎnfū* play the *qí* (zither), and the emperor leaned against the zither and sang, his voice filled with sorrow and melancholy. He looked around and said to the ministers, "Alas! If I were to use the northern mountains’ stone as a coffin, fill it with silk and hemp, and seal it with lacquer, would it not be unmovable?" Those around him all said, "Excellent!" Zhāng stepped forward and said, "If there were something desirable within, even if you sealed it with the southern mountains, there would still be a way in. If there were nothing desirable within, even without a stone coffin, why would you grieve?" Emperor Wén praised him. Later, Zhāng was appointed as *tíngyù* (chief justice).

Soon after, the emperor traveled along the *Zhōngwèi qiáo* (Middle Wei Bridge), and a man ran out from under the bridge, causing the imperial carriage horses to startle. The emperor ordered the cavalry to capture the man and handed him over to the *tíngyù*. Zhāng questioned him and said, "The man from the county heard the imperial procession and hid under the bridge. After a long time, he thought the procession had passed and came out, seeing the imperial carriage and attendants, so he ran away." According to the law, if a commoner accidentally stepped on the imperial carriage, he should be fined. Emperor Wén was angry and said, "This man personally startled my horses. My horses are fortunate to be gentle; if they were other horses, would they not have injured me? Yet the chief justice only fines him!" Zhāng said, "The law is something the emperor shares with the people. If you now change the law and impose a heavier penalty, it will make the law unreliable among the people. Moreover, at that moment, if you had ordered his immediate execution, that would have been sufficient. Now that he has been handed over to the chief justice, who is the arbiter of justice for the entire country, if you arbitrarily alter the penalty, the people will not know where to place their hands and feet. I hope Your Majesty will consider this carefully." After a long time, the emperor said, "The chief justice is correct."

Later, someone stole a jade ring from in front of the *Gāogōng* (High Temple), and the thief was captured. Emperor Wén was furious and ordered the chief justice to investigate. Zhāng examined the law and found that stealing from the ancestral temple’s treasures should be punished by execution. He reported this, and Emperor Wén was extremely angry, saying, "This man is unfilial, stealing from the treasures of my ancestors. I entrusted this matter to the chief justice, intending to exterminate his family, yet you report it according to the law. This is not what I intended when I entrusted you with the ancestral temple!" Zhāng removed his hat and bowed his head in apology, saying, "The law is sufficient in itself. Moreover, crimes are equal, but the consequences differ based on obedience or defiance. If stealing from the ancestral temple is punished by extermination, what if a foolish peasant took a handful of soil from the *Chánglíng* mausoleum? How would Your Majesty apply the law to that?" After a long time, Emperor Wén discussed this with Empress Dowager Bó, and they agreed that the chief justice’s judgment was correct. At this time, *zhōngwèi* Zhōu Yǒufú and *Liángxiàng* Shāng Dūhóu Zhāng Yǒng saw that Zhāng upheld justice and treated matters impartially, so they formed a close friendship with him. Zhāng Shìzhī was thus renowned throughout the country.

Later, Emperor Wén died, and Emperor Shǐng succeeded to the throne. Zhāng feared that he would be punished, so he pretended to be ill and wished to resign. He feared a large-scale purge, but he also did not know how Emperor Shǐng would react. He followed the advice of Wáng Shēng and eventually went to apologize. Emperor Shǐng did not hold a grudge against him.

Wáng Shēng was an expert in *Huánglǎo* philosophy and a recluse. He had once been summoned to reside in the palace, where the three dukes and nine ministers gathered. Wáng Shēng, an old man, said, "I am unsteady," and turned to Zhāng Shìzhī, saying, "Tie my sash for me!" Zhāng knelt and tied it. Afterward, someone asked Wáng Shēng, "Why did you humiliate Zhāng Shìzhī by making him kneel to tie your sash?" Wáng Shēng replied, "I am old and lowly, and I believe I will never benefit Zhāng Shìzhī. Zhāng Shìzhī is currently one of the most renowned ministers in the country. I deliberately humiliated him by making him kneel to tie my sash to honor him." The ministers heard this and admired Wáng Shēng while respecting Zhāng Shìzhī.

Zhāng Shìzhī served under Emperor Shǐng for more than a year before being appointed as the *xiàng* (minister) of the Prince of Huái Nán. He still held onto his past mistakes. After a long time, Zhāng died. His son, Zhāng Zhì, with the courtesy name of Chánggōng, held the position of *dàfū* (minister) but was later dismissed. Unable to gain favor with the times, he never held office again.

Féng Táng’s great-grandfather was from Zhào. His father moved to Dài. When Hàn was established, the family moved to Ānlíng. Féng was known for his filial piety and served as the head of the *zhōngláng* office under Emperor Wén. When Emperor Wén passed by in his carriage, he asked Féng, "Why are you an official? Where is your family?" Féng answered truthfully. Emperor Wén said, "When I was in Dài, my *shàngshíjiàn* (supervisor of the imperial kitchen) Gāo Qǔ often spoke highly of the virtue of Zhào’s general Lǐ Qí, who fought at the Battle of Jùlú. Now, whenever I eat, my mind is always at Jùlú. Did your father know of this?" Féng replied, "He was not as good as the generals Lián Pái and Lǐ Mù." The emperor asked, "Why?" Féng said, "My great-grandfather served as an officer in Zhào and was close to Lǐ Mù. My father, who later served as the *dài xiàng* (minister) of Dài, was close to the Zhào general Lǐ Qí and knew his character." The emperor, upon hearing of Lián Pái and Lǐ Mù’s virtues, was delighted and struck his thigh, saying, "Alas! If only I had had Lián Pái and Lǐ Mù as my generals when I was alive, would I have worried about the Xióngnú?" Féng said, "My lord! Even if you had Lián Pái and Lǐ Mù, you would not be able to use them." The emperor became angry and went into the forbidden palace. After a long time, he summoned Féng and scolded him, saying, "How dare you repeatedly insult me? Is there no place for you to speak?" Féng apologized, saying, "I am a simple man and do not know what to avoid."

At that time, the Xióngnú had recently invaded *Cháonà*, killing the *dūjù* (prefect) of Běidì, Mǎo. The emperor was concerned about the Xióngnú raids and finally asked Féng again, "How do you know that I cannot use Lián Pái and Lǐ Mù?" Féng replied, "I have heard that in ancient times, when kings dispatched generals, they would kneel and push the carriage wheels, saying, 'Within the palace gates, I control matters; outside the palace gates, the general controls matters.' Military rewards and punishments were all decided outside, and then reported back. This was not empty talk. My great-grandfather said that Lǐ Mù, as a Zhào general stationed at the border, used the revenue from the military markets entirely to provide for his soldiers. Rewards and punishments were decided outside, without interference from the court. He was entrusted with authority and held responsible for results, so Lǐ Mù could fully utilize his intelligence and abilities. He selected 1,300 chariots, 13,000 archers, and 100,000 soldiers who were willing to risk their lives. Thus, he drove the northern Xúnú away, defeated the Dōnghú, destroyed Dànlín, suppressed the powerful Qín to the west, and supported Hàn and Wèi to the south. At that time, Zhào nearly became a hegemon. Later, when King Xián of Zhào was enthroned, his mother was a courtesan. When King Xián was enthroned, he listened to the slander of Guō Kāi and ultimately executed Lǐ Mù, replacing him with Yán Jù. As a result, the army was defeated, and the soldiers fled north, leading to the capture and destruction of Zhào by Qín. Now, I have secretly heard that Wèi Shàng serves as the *yùnzhōng shǒu* (prefect of Yúnzhōng), and he uses all the revenue from the military markets to provide for his soldiers. He secretly raises funds, slaughtering a cow every five days to entertain his guests, military officers, and attendants. Thus, the Xióngnú avoid the Yúnzhōng border. When the Xióngnú once invaded, Wèi Shàng led his chariots and cavalry to attack them, killing many of their forces. These soldiers are all commoners’ sons who left their fields to join the army. How could they know the details of military records and formations? They spend the whole day fighting, cutting off heads and capturing prisoners, reporting their achievements to the command center, and if they do not respond correctly, the bureaucrats punish them according to the law. The rewards do not reach them, but the bureaucrats strictly enforce the law. I, being foolish, believe that Your Majesty’s laws are too clear, rewards too light, and punishments too severe. Moreover, the prefect of Yúnzhōng, Wèi Shàng, was demoted in rank and fined for reporting six levels fewer heads and prisoners than required. Your Majesty handed him over to the bureaucrats, reducing his rank and forcing him to labor. Based on this, even if you had Lián Pái and Lǐ Mù, you would not be able to use them. I am truly foolish, having offended by speaking what I should not. I deserve to die!" Emperor Wén was pleased. That day, he ordered Féng Táng to carry a *jié* (imperial commission) to pardon Wèi Shàng and restore him to the position of *yùnzhōng shǒu*, while appointing Féng as *chēqí dūwèi* (commander of the imperial carriage corps), overseeing the *zhōngwèi* and the charioteers of the provinces and states.

In the seventh year, Emperor Shǐng succeeded to the throne and appointed Féng as the *xiàng* of Chǔ, but he was later dismissed. Emperor Wǔ sought *xiánliáng* (virtuous and talented men) and recommended Féng Táng. By then, Féng was over ninety years old and could no longer serve as an official, so his son Féng Suí was appointed as a *láng* (attendant). Féng Suí, with the courtesy name of Wángsūn, was also a remarkable man and was friendly with me.

The Grand Historian says: Zhāng Jì’s praise of men of integrity, upholding the law without bending to personal will; Féng Gōng’s discussion of generals, is full of flavor! How full of flavor it is! The saying goes, "If you do not know a man, look at his friends." The two gentlemen are worthy of being praised and recorded in the halls of virtue. The Book says, "Not partial, not biased—this is the way of the king, vast and unbounded; not biased, not partial—this is the way of the king, smooth and convenient." Zhāng Jì and Féng Gōng are close to this ideal. [end of text]
