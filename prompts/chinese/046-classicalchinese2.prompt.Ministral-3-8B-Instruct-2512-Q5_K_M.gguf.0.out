### **(1) Translation into English**

**The Story of King Wu Hou and Wu Qi**

King Wu Hou of Wei was skilled in planning and decision-making, surpassing all his ministers. After a court session, he would often show signs of joy. Wu Qi, a general, approached and said, *"Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu spoken to his attendants?"*

King Wu Hou asked, *"What did King Zhuang of Chu say?"*

Wu Qi replied:
*"King Zhuang of Chu was also skilled in planning and decision-making, surpassing all his ministers. Yet after court sessions, he would often appear worried. His advisor, Shen Gong Wu Chen, asked, ‘Why do Your Majesty appear worried after court sessions?’ King Zhuang replied, ‘I am worried because I am skilled in planning and decision-making, yet my ministers cannot match me. The ancient saying goes: ‘A ruler who relies only on himself will be overthrown; one who gains allies will become a hegemon; one who earns trust will survive; but one who relies solely on himself and no one equals him will perish.’ Now, with my unworthiness, if my ministers cannot match me, my state may soon perish! That is why I am worried.’"*

King Zhuang of Chu worried, but Your Majesty, you rejoice. King Wu Hou bowed twice in humility and said, *"Heaven has sent you, Master, to correct my mistakes."*

### **(2) Moral of the Story**

The passage conveys a **cautionary lesson about arrogance and self-reliance in leadership**:

1. **The Danger of Overconfidence** – King Zhuang of Chu, despite his brilliance, feared that his superiority over his ministers would lead to his downfall because he lacked allies or trusted advisors who could balance his power. His worry stemmed from the realization that absolute self-sufficiency in governance is unsustainable.

2. **The Virtue of Humility and Self-Criticism** – King Wu Hou’s joy in his own success contrasts sharply with King Zhuang’s humility. Wu Qi’s intervention serves as a reminder that a wise ruler should recognize their limitations and seek counsel from others, lest they become isolated and vulnerable.

3. **The Role of Advisors** – The passage highlights the importance of trusted advisors who can challenge a ruler’s ego and prevent reckless decisions. King Zhuang’s advisor, Shen Gong Wu Chen, played a crucial role in keeping him grounded.

4. **The Paradox of Success** – The more successful a leader becomes, the more they should be wary of complacency. King Zhuang’s fear was not of failure but of the consequences of unchecked dominance.

In essence, the story warns against **hubris in leadership**—the belief that one’s own intelligence or skill is sufficient without the input of others. It aligns with Confucian and Daoist ideals of **self-reflection, moderation, and the importance of the "middle way."**

### **(3) Counterparts in Western (European) Thought**

Yes, the themes in this passage have clear parallels in Western philosophical, political, and historical thought:

#### **A. Political Philosophy: The Danger of Tyranny and Self-Reliance**
- **Plato’s *Republic*** – Plato warns against the dangers of a single ruler’s unchecked wisdom in *Book VIII*, where he describes the "tyrant" who believes himself infallible and surrounds himself with flatterers rather than honest advisors. Socrates argues that such a ruler will inevitably lead to chaos.
- **Niccolò Machiavelli’s *The Prince*** – Machiavelli advises rulers to appear wise but also to surround themselves with capable advisors (e.g., "It is better to be feared than loved, but if you cannot be both, you should aim to be loved"). However, he also acknowledges that overconfidence can lead to downfall (e.g., Cesare Borgia’s reliance on his own strength rather than alliances).
- **Montesquieu’s *The Spirit of the Laws*** – Emphasizes the need for **checks and balances** in government to prevent tyranny, much like King Zhuang’s fear of relying solely on himself.

#### **B. Historical Precedents: The Fall of Overconfident Leaders**
- **King Henry VIII of England** – His refusal to listen to advisors (e.g., Thomas More) and his belief in his own divine right led to instability and the dissolution of the Church of England.
- **Napoleon Bonaparte** – Initially successful due to his military genius, but his later campaigns (e.g., Russia, Waterloo) were marked by overconfidence and disregard for counsel, leading to defeat.
- **Hitler’s Germany** – His isolation from dissenting voices (e.g., the "Beer Hall Putsch" advisors) contributed to his downfall.

#### **C. Philosophical Concepts: Humility and Self-Criticism**
- **Aristotle’s *Nicomachean Ethics*** – Virtue lies in the **mean** between extremes. Overconfidence (hybris) is a vice, while humility is a virtue.
- **Seneca’s *Letters to Lucilius*** – Seneca frequently warns against pride and the dangers of believing one’s own wisdom is absolute. He writes:
  > *"The greatest obstacle to living is expectancy, which hangs upon tomorrow and loses today."* (Letter 49)
  > *"Pride is the beginning of all evil."* (Letter 122)
- **René Descartes’ *Meditations*** – While Descartes famously begins with *"I think, therefore I am,"* he later acknowledges the limits of human reason and the need for humility in knowledge (*"The more I have studied, the more I have come to know how little I know"*).

#### **D. Modern Political Theory: The "Lone Genius" Myth**
- **James Madison’s Federalist No. 55** – Argues that a single leader’s wisdom is insufficient for governance; institutions must be designed to prevent tyranny.
- **Robert J. Lifton’s *The Nazi Doctors*** – Examines how unchecked confidence in ideology (e.g., Nazi racial theories) led to atrocities due to lack of dissenting voices.

#### **E. Literary and Dramatic Parallels**
- **Shakespeare’s *Macbeth*** – Macbeth’s overconfidence after his victories leads to his downfall when he ignores warnings (e.g., the witches, Lady Macbeth’s guilt).
- **Sophocles’ *King Oedipus*** – Oedipus’ refusal to accept his own mistakes (e.g., ignoring the oracle) leads to his tragic fate.

### **Key Western Equivalent Concepts**
| **Chinese Concept (from the Passage)** | **Western Counterpart** |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Overconfidence in one’s own wisdom** | **Hubris (Greek tragedy), Pride (Christian vice), Tyranny (Plato/Machiavelli)** |
| **Need for trusted advisors** | **Counsel in *The Prince*, Checks and balances (Montesquieu), "The wise man consults others" (Heraclitus)** |
| **Fear of isolation in leadership** | **Loneliness of power (Nietzsche’s "Übermensch" paradox), "No man is an island" (Donne)** |
| **Self-criticism as virtue** | **Humility (Aristotle, Seneca), "The examined life" (Socrates), "Mortification of pride" (Augustine)** |

### **Conclusion**
The story of King Wu Hou and Wu Qi reflects a **universal cautionary tale** about the pitfalls of unchecked self-confidence in leadership. Western thought, from ancient Greek philosophy to modern political theory, repeatedly warns against the same dangers—whether through the lens of **tyranny, hubris, or the necessity of humility**. The passage’s moral—that a ruler must balance self-assurance with openness to critique—resonates deeply in both Eastern and Western traditions as a cornerstone of wise governance. [end of text]
