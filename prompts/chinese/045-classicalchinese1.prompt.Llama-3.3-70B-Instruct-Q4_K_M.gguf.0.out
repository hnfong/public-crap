I'll answer the questions concisely.

Q1: West Gate Officer Ximen Bao stopped the practice of sacrificing girls to the river god by throwing the corrupt officials and shamans into the river, and then built canals to bring water to the people's fields, bringing prosperity to the region. (5 points)

Q2: Young girls from poor families, especially those considered beautiful, were the usual victims. (2 points)

Q3: The corrupt officials (三老, 廷掾) and shamans (巫祝) benefited from the old practice, as they would take the money collected from the people and divide it among themselves. (2 points)

Q4: The protagonist, Ximen Bao, used a combination of wits and force to deal with the situation. He cleverly manipulated the corrupt officials and shamans, using their own beliefs against them, and then used force to throw them into the river. (5 points)

Q5: From a utilitarian perspective, Ximen Bao's actions can be seen as moral, as they brought about a greater good for the people. From a deontological perspective, his actions can be seen as immoral, as they involved violence and deception. From a cultural perspective, his actions can be seen as a necessary measure to challenge corrupt traditions and bring about positive change. (10 points)

Q6: The comment means that three officials, Zichan, Zijian, and Ximen Bao, each had a different approach to governance. Zichan's people couldn't cheat because they were honest, Zijian's people didn't dare to cheat because they were afraid, and Ximen Bao's people didn't dare to cheat because they were intimidated. The comment is fair in that it highlights the different strengths and weaknesses of each official's approach, but it can also be seen as oversimplifying the complexities of governance. Ximen Bao's approach, while effective in the short term, may not be the most sustainable or desirable in the long term. (15 points) [end of text]
