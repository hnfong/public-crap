I need to answer questions about the story from "滑稽列传," which is part of Sima Qian's "史记." The story focuses on西门豹, who was appointed as the magistrate of Ye. He discovers that the local officials and witches are exploiting the people by demanding money for a ritual to marry a girl to the River God. This leads to the girls being drowned, causing families to flee and leaving the city empty.西门豹 cleverly exposes this fraud by inviting the witch and her disciples to the river, ultimately drowning them.

In the story,西门豹 uses his wit to expose the corruption of the local officials and witches. He cleverly manipulates the situation by claiming the witch and her disciples are too incompetent to communicate with the River God, leading to their drowning. This act of deception highlights the absurdity of the ritual. After this, he implements irrigation projects to improve the land, ensuring the people benefit from the water. The story emphasizes the importance of using intelligence over force to address wrongdoing.

The story highlights that the victims were young women from poor families, specifically those deemed "good-looking" by the witch. The old practice of offering girls benefited the local officials, witches, and their disciples, who exploited the situation for personal gain. The protagonist,西门豹, used his wit rather than force, employing a clever ruse to expose the corruption. He pretended to send the witch and her disciples to the River God, ultimately drowning them, which cleverly turned the ritual against the corrupt officials.

The moral justification for the protagonist's actions can be viewed from several perspectives. From a utilitarian standpoint, he saved many lives and ended exploitation, which is a positive outcome. However, from a deontological view, he committed murder, which raises ethical concerns. Legally, he executed corrupt officials without due process, which is problematic. Confucian ethics would see him as righteous, while Legalist thought might support his actions as necessary for order. Daoist perspectives might view it as a return to natural order, and Legalist thought would emphasize the need for strict laws to maintain stability.

### Q1: Short summary
Wei’s magistrate Ximen Bao exposes a corrupt “River God” marriage ritual in Ye that drowns girls and enriches local elders, witches, and clerks. He feigns sending the witch and her disciples to “report” to the god, drowning them, then forces the elders to stop the practice. He later builds irrigation canals that make the people prosperous.

### Q2: Victims
Young women from poor families, selected by the witch for being “good-looking.”

### Q3: Who benefited
The local elders (sanlao), clerks (tingyuan), and the witch and her disciples, who split the collected money.

### Q4: Wits or force?
Wits. Ximen Bao uses a staged, ritualized ruse to expose and punish the fraud, turning the very superstition against its perpetrators.

### Q5: Was it moral? (brief views)
- Utilitarian: Yes—saved many lives and ended exploitation.
- Deontological: No—killed without trial; violates rules against murder.
- Legal: Mixed—stopped crime but bypassed due process.
- Confucian: Largely yes—upheld righteousness and protected the people.
- Legalist: Yes—necessary severity to deter corruption and restore order.
- Daoist: Mixed—restored natural order but used violence.
- Modern: Generally no—summary execution is unjust; better to prosecute and reform.

### Q6: Meaning and fairness of the quote
Meaning: Zichan (Zheng) governed so people couldn’t deceive him; Zijian (Shanfu) so people wouldn’t want to deceive him; Ximen Bao (Ye) so people dared not deceive him. Fairness: The comment is plausible but reductive. Ximen Bao’s “dare not” reflects fear of punishment; Zichan’s “cannot” shows competence; Zijian’s “would not” reflects moral charisma. Each style fits context; none is universally superior. [end of text]
