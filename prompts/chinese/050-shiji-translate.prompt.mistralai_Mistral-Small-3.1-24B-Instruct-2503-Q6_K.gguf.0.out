**The Biographies of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang**

Zhang Shizhi, the Chief Justice, was from Duyang and was known by the style name Ji. He had an elder brother named Zhong, and they lived together. He was appointed as a cavalry attendant based on his wealth and served Emperor Xiaowen. For ten years, he did not receive a promotion and was unknown. Shizhi said, "Long-term service reduces my brother's property, and I am not successful." He wanted to resign and return home. The commander of the imperial guards, Yuan Ang, knew of his virtue and regretted his departure, so he requested that Shizhi be transferred to be an attendant. After Shizhi finished his court duties, he spoke about matters of convenience. The emperor said, "Speak humbly, do not discuss high principles, but speak of what can be implemented now." Thus, Shizhi spoke about matters between Qin and Han, and about how Qin lost and Han rose for a long time. The emperor praised him and appointed Shizhi as the chief attendant.

Shizhi followed the emperor on an outing and ascended the tiger enclosure. The emperor asked the superintendent of Shanglin Park about the records of various birds and beasts, asking more than ten questions. The superintendent looked around but could not answer. A servant from the tiger enclosure answered the emperor's questions about the birds and beasts thoroughly, intending to show his ability to respond quickly. The emperor said, "Officials should not be like this! The superintendent is unreliable!" He then ordered Shizhi to appoint the servant as the superintendent of Shanglin Park. Shizhi said for a long time, "Your Majesty, what kind of person is Jianghuo Hou Zhou Bao?" The emperor said, "He is a respected elder." Shizhi asked again, "What kind of person is Dongyang Hou Zhang Xiang?" The emperor replied, "He is a respected elder." Shizhi said, "Jianghuo Hou and Dongyang Hou are called respected elders. These two people, when speaking of matters, could not open their mouths. How can they compare to this servant who is eloquent and quick-witted! Moreover, Qin relied on clerks, and officials competed to be harsh and meticulous, but their harm was only in formalities, without genuine compassion. Therefore, their faults were not heard, and they declined until the end of the second emperor, causing the collapse of the empire. Now, Your Majesty promotes the servant for his eloquence, I fear that the world will follow the wind and strive to be eloquent without substance. Moreover, the influence of superiors on inferiors is swift like an echo, and mistakes cannot be made carelessly." The emperor said, "Good." He then stopped the appointment of the servant.

The emperor boarded the carriage and summoned Shizhi to ride with him. They walked slowly, and the emperor asked Shizhi about the flaws of Qin. Shizhi spoke frankly. Upon returning to the palace, the emperor appointed Shizhi as the superintendent of public carriages.

Soon after, the crown prince and the prince of Liang rode together in a carriage to court but did not dismount at the gate of the commander of the guards. Shizhi pursued and stopped the crown prince and the prince of Liang, preventing them from entering the palace gate. He then accused them of disrespect for not dismounting at the public gate and reported it. Empress Dowager Bo heard about it, and the emperor removed his cap and apologized, saying, "I did not educate my son carefully." Empress Dowager Bo then sent an envoy to announce the pardon of the crown prince and the prince of Liang, after which they were allowed to enter. The emperor was impressed by Shizhi and appointed him as a grand master of the palace.

Soon after, he was promoted to commander of the imperial guards. He followed the emperor to Bailing, staying north of the toilet. At that time, Shengfu was present, and the emperor pointed out the new Fengdao to Shengfu, saying, "This is the road to Handan." He had Shengfu play the zither, and the emperor himself leaned on the zither and sang, with a sad and melancholic expression. He looked at the officials and said, "Alas! Using the stones of Beishan for the coffin, filling it with silk and cotton, and sealing it with lacquer, how can it be moved!" Those around him all said, "Good." Shizhi stepped forward and said, "If there is something desirable inside, even if it is sealed with Nanshan, there will still be a way; if there is nothing desirable inside, even without a stone coffin, what is there to worry about!" The emperor praised him. Later, Shizhi was appointed as the chief justice.

Soon after, the emperor was traveling and crossed the Zhongwei Bridge. A man ran out from under the bridge, startling the imperial horses. The emperor ordered the cavalry to capture him and handed him over to the chief justice. Shizhi interrogated him. The man said, "I am a local person. I heard the sound of the emperor's carriage and hid under the bridge. After a long time, thinking the carriage had passed, I came out and saw the imperial carriage and cavalry, so I ran away." The chief justice, Qin Dang, ruled that the man had disturbed the emperor and should be fined. The emperor was angry and said, "This man startled my horse. Fortunately, my horse is gentle, but if it were another horse, it would surely have injured me! Yet the chief justice only fines him!" Shizhi said, "The law is what the emperor shares with the people. Now the law is like this, but you want to make it heavier, this makes the law untrustworthy to the people. Moreover, at that time, if you had ordered his immediate execution, it would have been fine. Now that you have handed him over to the chief justice, the chief justice is the standard for the world. If you tilt it, then the world's use of the law will all be light or heavy, and the people will not know where to place their hands and feet. Only Your Majesty can consider this." After a long time, the emperor said, "The chief justice is correct."

Later, someone stole a jade ring from in front of the high temple and was captured. The emperor was angry and ordered the chief justice to handle it. Shizhi examined the law regarding the theft of imperial regalia and reported that the punishment should be execution in the market. The emperor was greatly angered and said, "The wickedness of people, stealing from the emperor's temple, I handed him over to the chief justice, intending to exterminate his clan, but you report the law, this is not in line with my intention to inherit the ancestral temple." Shizhi removed his cap and kowtowed, saying, "The law is sufficient. Moreover, the crime is equal, but the punishment is differentiated by obedience and disobedience. Now, stealing from the ancestral temple and exterminating the clan, if there is even one in ten thousand, suppose a foolish peasant takes a handful of soil from Changling, how would Your Majesty punish him?" After a long time, the emperor discussed it with the empress dowager and agreed with the chief justice's ruling. At that time, the commander of the capital, Zhou Yafu, and the prime minister of Liang, Wang Tian, saw that Shizhi's arguments were fair, and they became friends. Zhang Shizhi was thus renowned throughout the empire.

After Emperor Xiaowen passed away, Emperor Jing ascended the throne, and Shizhi was afraid, claiming illness. He wanted to resign but feared a great punishment; he wanted to see the emperor to apologize but did not know how. Following the advice of Wang Sheng, he finally saw the emperor to apologize, and Emperor Jing did not blame him.

Wang Sheng was a scholar of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi, a recluse. He was once summoned to the court, and the three dukes and nine ministers all stood to greet him. Wang Sheng, an old man, said, "My belt is loose," and looked at Zhang Shizhi, saying, "Tie my belt for me!" Shizhi knelt and tied it. Afterward, someone said to Wang Sheng, "Why did you humiliate Zhang Shizhi, making him kneel to tie your belt?" Wang Sheng said, "I am old and lowly, and I know that I can be of no benefit to Zhang Shizhi. Zhang Shizhi is a renowned minister of the empire, so I deliberately humiliated him, making him kneel to tie my belt, to honor him." The officials heard this and respected Wang Sheng and honored Zhang Shizhi.

Zhang Shizhi served Emperor Jing for over a year, then became the prime minister of Huainan. He still feared his past mistakes. After a long time, Shizhi passed away. His son, Zhang Zhi, styled Changgong, held the office of grand master but was dismissed. Because he could not accommodate himself to the times, he did not serve in office for the rest of his life.

Feng Tang's great-grandfather was from Zhao. His father moved to Dai. When Han arose, he moved to Anling. Tang was known for his filial piety and served as the chief of the imperial guards, attending to Emperor Xiaowen. The emperor's carriage passed by, and he asked Tang, "Old man, why are you a cavalry attendant? Where is your home?" Tang answered honestly. The emperor said, "When I was in Dai, my chief eunuch Gao Ku often spoke to me about the virtues of Zhao's general Li Qi, who fought at Julu. Now, every time I eat, my mind is still on Julu. Do you know about this?" Tang replied, "He is not as good as Lian Po or Li Mu as a general." The emperor asked, "Why?" Tang said, "My great-grandfather, when he was in Zhao, was an official and a general, and he knew Li Mu well. My father was once the prime minister of Dai and knew Zhao's general Li Qi, knowing his character." The emperor, having heard about Lian Po and Li Mu, was pleased and patted his thigh, saying, "Alas! I alone did not have Lian Po and Li Mu as my generals, how could I worry about the Xiongnu!" Tang said, "Your Majesty, even if you had Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them." The emperor was angry, stood up, and entered the palace. After a long time, he summoned Tang and reproached him, saying, "Why do you humiliate me in front of everyone, is there no private place?" Tang apologized, saying, "I, a rustic, do not know about taboos."

At that time, the Xiongnu had recently invaded Chona and killed the commander of Beidi, Yu. The emperor was concerned about the barbarian invasion and finally asked Tang again, "Why do you say I cannot use Lian Po and Li Mu?" Tang replied, "I heard that in ancient times, when the kings sent out generals, they knelt and pushed the wheel, saying, 'Within the gate, I control it; outside the gate, the general controls it.' Military achievements and rewards are decided outside and reported upon return. This is not an empty saying. My great-grandfather said that Li Mu, as Zhao's general on the border, used the market taxes to reward the soldiers, and the rewards were decided outside, not interfered with from within. He was entrusted with the task and held responsible for the success, so Li Mu was able to fully use his wisdom and abilities, selecting a thousand three hundred chariots, thirteen thousand archers, and ten million soldiers with a thousand pieces of gold, thus driving back the single chieftain, defeating the Eastern Hu, annihilating Danlin, suppressing the strong Qin in the west, and supporting Han and Wei in the south. At that time, Zhao was almost hegemonic. Later, when King Xian of Zhao ascended the throne, his mother was a singer. King Xian ascended the throne and used Guo Kai's slander, ultimately executing Li Mu and replacing him with Yan Ju. Thus, the army was defeated and the soldiers fled north, being captured and annihilated by Qin. Now, I secretly hear that Wei Shang, as the commander of Yunzhong, uses all the market taxes to reward the soldiers, providing private funds, slaughtering a cow every five days to entertain guests, military officers, and retainers, so the Xiongnu stay far away and do not approach the Yunzhong pass. The Xiongnu once invaded, and Shang led the chariots and cavalry to attack them, killing many of their people. The soldiers are all sons of the people, rising from the fields to join the army, how do they know about military records and tallies. They fight all day, beheading and capturing enemies, but their achievements are not recorded, and a single word does not match, and the clerks punish them according to the law. Their rewards are not implemented, and the officials strictly enforce the law. I, foolish, think that Your Majesty's laws are too clear, the rewards too light, and the punishments too heavy. Moreover, the commander of Yunzhong, Wei Shang, was demoted for his achievements in beheading and capturing enemies differing by six ranks. Your Majesty handed him over to the officials, stripped his title, and punished him with labor. From this, it can be said that Your Majesty, even if you had Lian Po and Li Mu, would not be able to use them. I am truly foolish, touching on taboos, a crime deserving death, a crime deserving death!" The emperor was pleased. On that day, he ordered Feng Tang to hold the imperial nodule to pardon Wei Shang, restoring him as the commander of Yunzhong, and appointed Tang as the commander of the cavalry, overseeing the commander of the capital and the cavalry of the commanderies and kingdoms.

In the seventh year, Emperor Jing ascended the throne and appointed Tang as the prime minister of Chu, who was then dismissed. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne, he sought talented and virtuous men and recommended Feng Tang. Tang was then over ninety years old and could no longer serve in office, so his son, Feng Sui, was appointed as an attendant. Sui, styled Wangsun, was also an unusual person and was friendly with me.

The Grand Historian said: Zhang Ji's words about respected elders, upholding the law without bending to personal wishes; Feng Gong's discussion of generals and commanders, how meaningful! How meaningful! It is said, "If you do not know a person, look at his friends." The two lords' praises can be inscribed in the halls of the ancestors. The Book says, "Not partial, not biased, the royal way is vast; not biased, not partial, the royal way is smooth." Zhang Ji and Feng Gong are close to this. [end of text]
