The Annals of Zhang Shi of Peng Tang

Zhang Tingwei, known as Zhang Shi, was a native of Houxing. His style name was Ji. He had an elder brother of the same surname living together with him. Zhang Shi served as a Gentleman Attendant (shilang) and served Emperor Xiaowen of Han. For ten years, he was not promoted and remained unknown. Zhang Shi said, “Long service as a eunuch has not benefited my elder brother.” He wished to resign and return home. Marshal Yuan Rong, knowing Zhang Shi’s talent, regretted his departure and requested that Zhang Shi be reassigned as an attendant to the imperial audience. After the audience, Zhang Shi took the opportunity to speak. Emperor Xiaowen said, “Speak humbly, do not praise excessively, only say what can be implemented now.” Zhang Shi discussed the affairs of the Qin and Han dynasties, explaining why Qin lost and Han prospered at length. Emperor Xiaowen praised him and appointed Zhang Shi as Chief Attendant to the Imperial Audience (shizheng).

Zhang Shi followed the emperor on his tours. When they reached the Tiger Enclosure, the emperor asked the Director of the Imperial Park about the list of beasts and birds. More than ten questions were asked, but the director and his attendants could not answer any. A eunuch, Yanfu, standing nearby, answered all the emperor’s questions about the beasts and birds in detail. The emperor wished to test if Yanfu could respond endlessly and fluently. Emperor Xiaowen said, “Is this not improper? The director is useless!” He then ordered Zhang Shi to be appointed Director of the Imperial Park.

Earlier, Zhang Shi had said to the emperor, “What do you think of Marquis of Dongping, Zhou Bo?” The emperor replied, “He is an elder.” The emperor then asked, “And what of Marquis of Dongyang, Zhang Xiaru?” The emperor again said, “He is an elder.” Zhang Shi said, “If the Marquis of Dongping and Marquis of Dongyang are called elders, yet they could not speak up when it mattered, how can we expect Yanfu, who only knows how to talk, to be truly capable?” He further said, “Qin relied on officials skilled in writing and strategy, but they only contended with each other in their writings, showing off their talents without real substance. Thus, their faults were not noticed, and by the second generation, the state collapsed. Now, Your Majesty promotes Yanfu based on his eloquence. I fear the world will be swayed by empty words, and no one will care for real ability. Moreover, the lower ranks imitate the upper, and errors in judgment cannot be overlooked.” The emperor said, “Well said.” He then refrained from appointing Yanfu.

The emperor got into his carriage and summoned Zhang Shi to ride along. They traveled slowly, and the emperor asked Zhang Shi about the decline of Qin. Zhang Shi gave a detailed account. When they reached the palace, the emperor appointed Zhang Shi as Director of the Imperial Carriages.

Soon after, the Crown Prince and the Prince of Liaodong entered the court together but did not dismount at the Sima Gate. Zhang Shi chased after them and prevented them from entering the palace gates. He reported them for not showing proper respect by not dismounting at the public gate. Empress Dowager Shang heard of it and the emperor, wearing mourning, apologized, saying, “I have not taught my son well.” Empress Dowager Shang then ordered an edict to pardon the Crown Prince and Prince of Liaodong, after which they were allowed to enter.

Because of this, the emperor grew to admire Zhang Shi and appointed him Central Grandee.

Soon after, Zhang Shi was promoted to Marshal of the Guards. When accompanying the emperor on a tour to Ba Ling, he stayed at the northern latrine. At that time, Lady Shen was with him. The emperor pointed out the new path to Shengyang and asked Lady Shen to play the zither. The emperor leaned on the zither and sang, his expression melancholy and sorrowful. He turned to the courtiers and said, “Alas! Using stones from the northern mountains as pillars, using coarse hemp to decorate, how can this move anyone?” All around said, “Well said.” Zhang Shi stepped forward and said, “If there is something desirable within, even if you use southern mountain ore as a pillar, it would still be lacking; if there is nothing desirable, even without a stone pillar, what is the use?” The emperor praised him and later appointed Zhang Shi as Minister of Justice.

Soon after, when the emperor was crossing the bridge at Zhongwei, a man ran out from under the bridge, startling the emperor’s horse. The emperor ordered a cavalryman to apprehend him and bring him to the Ministry of Justice. Zhang Shi investigated the case and found that the man, a local, had hidden under the bridge after hearing the procession, thinking it had already passed. When he saw the carriages and horses, he simply ran away. The Ministry of Justice, Qian Dang, wanted to sentence him to a fine. The emperor was angry and said, “This man frightened my horse, which is gentle and well-trained. Even if other horses are not as good as mine, why should they be punished? And yet the Ministry of Justice wants to fine him!” Zhang Shi replied, “The law is a matter shared between the Son of Heaven and the people. If the law is changed and applied unevenly, the people will not trust it. Furthermore, if the emperor wishes to execute someone, he may do so directly. But if the Ministry of Justice is to be the standard of justice for the realm, then one arbitrary decision will make the application of law throughout the realm inconsistent. How can the people know how to conduct themselves? Only Your Majesty can discern this.” After a long time, the emperor said, “The Ministry of Justice was correct.”

Later, someone stole a jade ring from the altar of the High Temple. The thief was caught, and the emperor, angry, ordered the Ministry of Justice to handle the case. Zhang Shi cited the law that stealing from the ancestral temple should result in exile and public execution. The emperor, furious, said, “A man steals from the altar of my predecessor’s temple. If my Ministry of Justice only seeks to apply the law and not to exterminate the culprit, that is not in line with my intention to uphold the ancestral temple.” Zhang Shi, bowing and apologizing, said, “The law is clear. However, the severity of punishment should depend on the degree of loyalty or treason. If one steals from the ancestral temple and is put to death, it is like punishing someone for taking a handful of soil from the Longling tomb. How should Your Majesty increase the penalty?” After some time, the emperor discussed it with Empress Dowager Shang and allowed the Ministry of Justice to proceed as before.

At that time, Zhong Yihou Zhou Yafu and Prince of Changlu Wang Kang of Liaodong consulted with Zhang Shi on legal matters and became close friends. From then on, Zhang Shi’s reputation spread throughout the realm.

After Emperor Xiaowen’s death, Emperor Jingdi ascended the throne. Zhang Shi, fearing repercussions, claimed illness and wished to resign, worried about a general amnesty or uncertain of his reception. Using a stratagem suggested by Wang Sheng, he eventually went to offer his resignation. Emperor Jingdi did not punish him.

Wang Sheng was skilled in Yellow Emperor teachings and was a recluse. Once, he was summoned to the court, and all three dukes and nine ministers stood to greet him. Wang Sheng, an old man, said, “My joints are stiff.” Turning to Zhang Shi, he said, “Help me tie my shoes.” Zhang Shi knelt and tied them. Later, someone asked Wang Sheng, “Why did you have the Minister of Justice kneel and tie your shoes?” Wang Sheng replied, “I am old and lowly, knowing my own worth. Zhang Shi is now a renowned minister of the realm. I merely humbled the Minister of Justice to show respect for him.” The courtiers, hearing this, admired Wang Sheng and respected Zhang Shi even more.

Zhang Shi served under Emperor Jingdi for a few years as Chancellor of Huainan but still retained his former reputation. Later, Zhang Shi died. His son, Zhang Mo, style name Changgong, reached the rank of Grandee but was dismissed. Unable to adapt to the times, he never held office again.

Peng Tang was the great-grandson of Zhao Ren. His grandfather moved to Dai. During Han’s revival, they relocated to Anling. Tang was known for his filial piety and served as Chief of the Gentlemen Attendants under Emperor Xiaowen. When the emperor passed by, he asked Tang, “Your father, being so old, why serve as an official? Where does your family live?” Tang answered truthfully. The emperor said, “When I was in Dai, I often ate coarse food and often spoke of Zhao General and Li Qi’s virtue, fighting at the Battle of Gulu. Even now, every meal reminds me of Gulu. Did your father know?” Tang replied, “He was not as good as Lan Bo or Li Mu as generals.” The emperor asked, “Why?” Tang answered, “My grandfather was a general under Zhao, respected Li Mu. My father was Chancellor of Dai, respected Zhao General and Li Qi, and knew their characters.” The emperor, hearing of Lan Bo and Li Mu, was pleased and said, “Alas! If only I had Lan Bo and Li Mu as my generals, why would I fear the Xiongnu?” Tang said, “Your Majesty, even if you had Lan Bo and Li Mu, you could not use them.” The emperor grew angry and went into seclusion. After a long time, he summoned Tang and said, “Sir, why do you always humiliate me and leave me no peace?” Tang apologized, saying, “I am ignorant and do not know the taboos.”

At that time, the Xiongnu had just come to court. They killed the Commander of the Northern Territories, Xun. The emperor suspected a Xiongnu invasion and again asked Tang, “How do you know I cannot use Lan Bo and Li Mu?” Tang replied, “I have heard that ancient kings, when appointing generals, would kneel and push a cart, saying, ‘Those inside the cart are under my command; those outside are under the general’s.’ Military rewards and honors are decided by the general, and only then reported. This is not mere talk. My grandfather said that Li Mu, as Zhao’s general at the border, used the market taxes to provision the soldiers, granting rewards independently without interference from the central authorities. He was entrusted with full authority and held accountable for success. Thus, Li Mu was able to use all his wisdom and skill, mobilizing 1,300 chariots and 13,000 cavalry, with 100,000 elite soldiers. He drove back the Xiongnu, defeated the Eastern Hu, destroyed the Danlin tribe, checked the Qin to the west, and supported the states of Han and Wei to the south. At that time, Zhao was nearly dominant. Later, when Zhao Wang moved his capital, his mother, Lady Qiao, was involved. Wang Zheng, using Guo Kai’s accusations, executed Li Mu and replaced him with Yan Ju. Thus, the army was defeated, and Zhao was destroyed by Qin. Now, I have heard that Wei Zong, defending Yunguan, also used all market taxes to provision soldiers—five oxen every five days to entertain guests, officers, and soldiers. Thus, the Xiongnu kept their distance and did not approach the Yunguan Pass. When they did attack once, Wei Zong led his cavalry and chariots to repel them, killing many. The soldiers, all commoners conscripted from the fields, knew nothing of ranks or banners. They fought all day, beheading and capturing enemies, but received no official recognition. The civil officials punished them according to law. Rewards were not given, yet officials had to enforce the law. I humbly believe that Your Majesty’s laws are too strict, rewards too light, and punishments too severe. Moreover, Wei Zong, for achieving great merit and capturing enemy heads, was only promoted six ranks, while Your Majesty’s officials, demoted and punished, are treated thus. From this, even if Your Majesty had Lan Bo and Li Mu, you could not use them. I am ignorant and fear I have committed a grave offense!”

The emperor was pleased. That day, he ordered Peng Tang to carry the ceremonial baton and pardon Wei Zong, restoring him as Defender of Yunguan, and appointed Tang as Director of Chariots and Cavalry and Supervisor of the Central Marshals and regional carriage officials.

In the seventh year, Emperor Jingdi ascended the throne and appointed Tang as Chancellor of Chu, but soon dismissed him. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne and sought talented men, he recommended Peng Tang. Tang, then over ninety years old, could not resume office, so his son Peng Sui was appointed as a Gentleman. Sui, style name Wangsun, was also an extraordinary man and was close to me.

The Grand Historian says: Zhang Ji’s words about “elders” uphold the law without bias; Peng Gong’s discussion of generals and leadership has substance! He said, “If you do not know a man, judge by his friends.” These are the words the two sovereigns praised and remembered. It is said, “Without bias or partisanship, the Way of the King is broad and open; without partisanship or bias, the Way of the King is straightforward and clear.” Zhang Ji and Peng Gong truly approached this ideal.
