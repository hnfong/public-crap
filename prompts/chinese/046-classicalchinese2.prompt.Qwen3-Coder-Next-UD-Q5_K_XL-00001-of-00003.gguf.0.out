**(1) Translation:**

When Marquis Wu of Wei (魏武侯) deliberated on state affairs and reached an appropriate decision, none of his ministers could match his insight. After the court session, he displayed a look of satisfaction. Wu Qi (吳起) stepped forward and said: “Has Your Highness ever heard the story of King Zhuang of Chu (楚莊王) mentioned by your attendants?”  
The marquis asked: “What did King Zhuang of Chu say?”  
Wu Qi replied: “King Zhuang of Chu, upon reaching a sound decision that none of his ministers could rival, returned to his palace with a *worried* expression. The official Shen Gong Wucheng (申公巫臣) approached and asked: ‘My lord, why do you wear a look of sorrow after court?’  
The king answered: ‘When I deliberate and my decisions are sound, yet none of my ministers can match me—that is a cause for concern. As it is said in the *Zhong Ling* (中蘬, possibly a lost text or miswritten for *Zhong Lü* or *Zhong Xing*): “A ruler who finds a *teacher* will *ascend to kingship*; who finds a *friend* will *maintain hegemony*; who finds an *adversary in counsel* will *survive*; but one who deliberates alone and finds no one equal to himself will *perish*.”  
Now, I am unworthy, yet none of my ministers can match me—our state is nearly on the verge of ruin! That is why I am distressed.’  
King Zhuang was *anxious*, yet Your Highness is *pleased*.”  

Marquis Wu hesitated, then bowed twice, saying: “Heaven has sent you, sir, to correct my error.”

**(2) Moral of the story:**

The moral is that **true wisdom lies not in personal brilliance alone, but in recognizing one’s limitations and valuing the counsel of others**. A ruler who is overly pleased with his own superior judgment—especially when no one else can challenge or contribute—is in grave danger of isolation, error, and eventual downfall. True leadership requires humility, openness to criticism, and the cultivation of wise advisors. As the quoted maxim states: *“He who finds a teacher rules; who finds a friend leads; who finds a challenger survives; who is self-sufficient and unmatched perishes.”*  
The story warns against intellectual arrogance and emphasizes that a healthy polity depends on *dialogue*, *disagreement*, and *mutual refinement* of ideas—not unilateral “correctness.”

**(3) Counterparts in Western (European) thought:**

Yes, the core ideas resonate strongly with several Western philosophical and political traditions:

- **Socratic irony & the Socratic method (Plato)**: Socrates famously claimed *“I know that I know nothing”* and sought truth through questioning—even when others claimed certainty. Like Wu Qi invoking King Zhuang, Socrates warned that intellectual arrogance (e.g., the unexamined life, or overconfidence in one’s wisdom) leads to moral and political failure. The *Apology* shows Socrates challenging Athenian elites who, like Marquis Wu, were pleased with their own superiority—yet were blind to their ignorance.

- **Aristotle on practical wisdom (*phronesis*) and deliberation**: In the *Nicomachean Ethics*, Aristotle stresses that wise deliberation (*bouleusis*) requires input from others, especially those with different experiences. A truly prudent person does not rely solely on personal insight but seeks *diverse perspectives* to avoid bias and error.

- **Republicanism & the “mixed constitution” (e.g., Cicero, Montesquieu)**: The idea that no single ruler—however wise—should govern unilaterally echoes the Western tradition’s emphasis on *checks and balances*. As Cicero wrote in *De Re Publica*, “A state is not the property of one man, but of the people”—and good governance requires *collaborative reason*, not solitary brilliance.

- **Enlightenment critiques of despotism (e.g., Locke, Montesquieu)**: The fear of a ruler who “finds no one equal to himself” parallels Enlightenment warnings against absolute power: such rulers become detached from reality, surrounded by flatterers, and prone to catastrophic errors (e.g., Louis XVI’s isolation before the French Revolution).

- **Modern organizational theory**: Concepts like *psychological safety* (Edmondson), *diversity of thought*, and *cognitive diversity* in decision-making echo Wu Qi’s warning: teams with no dissenters or critical voices are prone to groupthink and failure.

In essence, the story’s core insight—that **intellectual humility and pluralism in deliberation are essential for survival and success**—is a cross-cultural universal, deeply embedded in both classical Chinese and Western political philosophy. [end of text]
