Okay, the user has shared a classical Chinese text from "滑稽列传" (The Humorous Biographies) about the famous official Ximen Bao, and asked six specific questions about it. This is clearly an academic exercise, likely for a Chinese literature or history class. The user seems to be a student who needs precise, concise answers with point values specified.

Hmm, let me analyze each question carefully. For Q1 (summary), I need to condense the key events: Ximen Bao exposes the river god marriage scam, sacrifices the witch and her disciples, and then builds irrigation canals. Must keep it under 5 points as requested.

Q2 (victims) is straightforward - the text says "small families' good daughters" (小家女好者), so poor girls from humble homes. 

Q3 (beneficiaries) - the text explicitly states the three elders, magistrates, and shamans shared the money (三老、廷掾常岁赋敛...与祝巫共分其余钱). 

Q4 (methods) - this is interesting. Ximen Bao used clever deception (pretending to send messengers to river god) rather than force. The "wits" angle is key here - he turned their own ritual against them.

Q5 (morality) needs balanced perspectives: 
- From anti-corruption view: absolutely moral (ended exploitation)
- From religious view: might be seen as disrespectful to tradition
- From practical view: saved lives and improved society
- Must be concise but cover multiple angles for 10 points.

Q6 (final quote) requires explaining the three officials' reputations and evaluating the comparison. The text says Ximen Bao "made people不敢欺" (dared not deceive), while Zichan "could not deceive" and Zijian "would not deceive" - so Ximen's method was most effective for harsh enforcement. The comment seems fair since it matches the story's emphasis on his decisive action.

*checks word count* Need to keep all answers tight. User said "concise" so I'll avoid elaboration. For Q5's 10 points, I'll structure it as four clear perspectives with one sentence each. 

*double-checks text* Important to note Ximen Bao didn't kill people - he "sent" the witch to the river god, which was a clever ruse. That's why it's wits not force. Must clarify that in Q4.

For Q6's fairness assessment: the quote actually praises Ximen Bao's method as most effective for his context (corrupt society), so the comment is fair. The "辨治者" part means officials who understand governance can distinguish these cases.

*mental note* Don't confuse "西门豹" with other historical figures. This is definitely the famous irrigation engineer from Warring States period.

**Q1: Summary (5 points)**  
Ximen Bao, as magistrate of Ye, exposes the corrupt practice of "marrying girls to the River God" orchestrated by local elites (three elders, magistrates, shamans) who extorted money from villagers. He tricks the witch and her disciples into being thrown into the river, ending the scam. He then builds irrigation canals, transforming Ye’s agriculture and earning lasting public respect.  

**Q2: Victims (2 points)**  
Poor girls from humble households ("小家女好者" – "good girls from small families").  

**Q3: Beneficiaries (2 points)**  
The three elders (三老), magistrates (廷掾), and shamans (祝巫), who shared the extortion money.  

**Q4: Method (5 points)**  
**Wits, not force.** Ximen Bao pretended to comply with the ritual but used deception: he "sent" the witch and her disciples to "report" to the River God, tricking the crowd into believing the River God was displeased. This exposed the fraud without violence, leveraging the villagers’ superstition against the corrupt officials.  

**Q5: Morality (10 points)**  
- **Pro-moral:** Ended exploitation of the poor, saved lives, and improved public welfare (pragmatic ethics).  
- **Religious view:** Disrespected local tradition (though the "River God" was a fraud).  
- **Legal view:** Upheld justice by dismantling systemic corruption.  
- **Cultural view:** Prioritized community well-being over hollow rituals (Confucian "benevolent governance").  
*Overall, morally justified as it replaced exploitation with sustainable development.*  

**Q6: Explanation & Fairness (15 points)**  
The quote compares three officials:  
- **Zichan (子產):** "Could not deceive" (people avoided deceit due to his wisdom).  
- **Zijian (子賤):** "Would not deceive" (people felt remorse to deceive him).  
- **Ximen Bao (西門豹):** "Dared not deceive" (people feared consequences of deceit).  
**Meaning:** Ximen Bao’s method was most effective for a corrupt society—his decisive action *prevented* deceit through fear of punishment, unlike Zichan’s wisdom or Zijian’s moral influence.  
**Fairness:** **Yes.** The text emphasizes Ximen Bao’s *action* (ending the scam via boldness) over passive virtue. His approach suited Ye’s crisis (corruption + superstition), making the comparison contextually fair. The "辨治者" (discerning officials) would agree his method was optimal for the situation.
