"Biographies of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang"

Zhang Tingwei Shizhi was a native of Duyang, with the courtesy name Ji. He had an elder brother named Zhong, with whom he lived. Relying on his wealth, he became a Cavalry Gentleman and served Emperor Xiaowen. For ten years, he did not receive a promotion and remained unknown. Shizhi said, "Prolonged official service is depleting Zhong's assets, and I am not succeeding." He wished to resign and return home. Zhonglangjiang Yuan Ang, recognizing his talent and regretting his departure, requested that Shizhi be transferred to fill the position of Aye (imperial attendant). After Shizhi had finished the court audience, he took the opportunity to mention matters of practical benefit. Emperor Wen said, "Speak plainly, without excessive lofty discourse, so that it can be implemented today." Shizhi then spoke at length about events between the Qin and Han dynasties, explaining why Qin had declined and Han had risen. Emperor Wen praised him and appointed Shizhi as Aye Pushe (chief of imperial attendants).

Shizhi accompanied the emperor on an outing and ascended the Tiger Enclosure. The emperor inquired about the register of birds and beasts from the Shanglin Commandant, asking over ten questions. The commandant looked around but could not answer any. The Tiger Enclosure supervisor, standing nearby, answered all the emperor's questions about the register of birds and beasts in great detail, wishing to demonstrate his ability to respond verbally without end. Emperor Wen said, "Should officials not be like this? The commandant is useless!" He then issued an edict appointing the supervisor as Shanglin Commandant. Shizhi stepped forward and said, "Your Majesty, what do you think of Marquis Jiang of Bo, Zhou Bo?" The emperor replied, "A man of integrity." Shizhi asked again, "And what of Marquis Dongyang, Zhang Xiangru?" The emperor again replied, "A man of integrity." Shizhi said, "Marquis Jiang and Marquis Dongyang are both called men of integrity, yet these two could not even express their opinions freely. How could they emulate this supervisor, who is glib and quick-witted? Moreover, Qin relied on petty officials skilled in pen and knife, and officials competed to be swift, harsh, and observant, but their flaws were merely superficial, lacking genuine compassion. As a result, they did not hear of their faults, leading to gradual decline until the Second Emperor, when the empire collapsed like dirt. Now, Your Majesty, because of the supervisor's verbal dexterity, promotes him beyond his rank. I fear that the world will follow suit, competing in verbal dexterity without substance. Furthermore, the influence of those below on those above is swifter than an echo. Actions must be considered carefully." Emperor Wen said, "Good," and stopped the appointment of the supervisor.

The emperor mounted his carriage and summoned Shizhi to ride beside him. They proceeded slowly, and the emperor asked Shizhi about the flaws of Qin. Shizhi spoke frankly and in detail. Upon arriving at the palace, the emperor appointed Shizhi as Gongche Ling (commandant of the public carriage office).

Soon after, the Crown Prince and Prince Liang entered the court together in the same carriage, failing to dismount at the Sima Gate. Shizhi pursued and stopped them, preventing their entry into the palace gate. He then impeached them for failing to dismount at the public gate out of disrespect and submitted the report. Empress Dowager Bo heard of this, and Emperor Wen removed his crown and apologized, saying, "I have not taught my sons properly." Empress Dowager Bo then sent an envoy with an imperial edict to pardon the Crown Prince and Prince Liang, allowing them to enter. From this, Emperor Wen came to regard Shizhi as remarkable and appointed him Zhong Da Fu (central government counselor).

Soon after, Shizhi became Zhonglangjiang. Accompanying the emperor to Baling, they stood facing north at a latrine. At that time, Shen Fu Ren was present, and the emperor pointed out the Xinfeng Road to Shen Fu Ren, saying, "This is the road to Handan." He had Shen Fu Ren play the se, and he himself sang along, leaning on the se, his expression sorrowful and melancholic. Turning to his ministers, he said, "Alas! If we use stones from Beishan to make a coffin, stuff it with hemp cloth, and seal it with lacquer, could it be moved?" Those nearby all said, "Good." Shizhi stepped forward and said, "If there is something desirable inside, even if it is sealed with Mount Nan, there will still be gaps. If there is nothing desirable inside, even without a stone coffin, what is there to fear?" Emperor Wen praised him. Afterward, he appointed Shizhi as Tingwei (chief minister of justice).

Soon after, the emperor was traveling out of Zhongwei Bridge when a man emerged from beneath the bridge, startling the imperial carriage horses. The emperor sent cavalry to capture him and handed him over to the Tingwei. Shizhi investigated and questioned him. The man said, "I am a county resident. Hearing the imperial procession, I hid beneath the bridge. After a long time, thinking the procession had passed, I came out and saw the imperial carriage and cavalry, so I ran." The Tingwei determined the punishment: one person had violated the imperial procession and should be fined. Emperor Wen angrily said, "This man personally startled my horse. Fortunately, my horse is gentle. If it had been another horse, would it not have injured me? Yet the Tingwei only fines him!" Shizhi said, "The law is what the emperor and the people share. If the law is now changed to be more severe, it will lose the people's trust. Moreover, at that moment, if the emperor had ordered his immediate execution, it would have been done. Now that the case has been referred to the Tingwei, the Tingwei is the arbiter of justice for the realm. If he is swayed even once, the application of the law throughout the realm will become inconsistent, and the people will not know how to conduct themselves. I beg Your Majesty to consider this." After a long while, the emperor said, "The Tingwei's decision is correct."

Later, someone stole a jade ring from the seat in front of the ancestral temple of Emperor Gao. The thief was captured, and Emperor Wen, enraged, referred the case to the Tingwei for punishment. Shizhi, following the law regarding theft of objects from the ancestral temple, reported that the thief should be executed in the marketplace. Emperor Wen, furious, said, "This man is so immoral as to steal from the ancestral temple of the former emperor. I referred him to the Tingwei to have his entire clan punished, but you report according to the law. This is not what I intended in honoring the ancestral temple." Shizhi removed his crown and kowtowed, apologizing, "The law is sufficient. Moreover, crimes are equal, but they differ based on whether they are committed against or in accordance with the law. Now, if we punish the theft of ancestral temple objects by exterminating the clan, suppose, in a one-in-ten-thousand chance, a foolish commoner takes a handful of soil from Changling. How would Your Majesty increase the punishment?" After a long time, Emperor Wen discussed it with Empress Dowager Bo and agreed to the Tingwei's decision. At that time, Zhongwei Tiaohou Zhou Yafu and Liang Xiang Shandu Hou Wang Tiankai, seeing that Shizhi's judgments were fair, became friends with him. Zhang Tingwei was thus praised throughout the realm.

Later, Emperor Wen died, and Emperor Jing ascended the throne. Shizhi, fearful, claimed illness and wished to resign, fearing severe punishment; yet he also wished to apologize in person, unsure of the outcome. Following Wang Sheng's advice, he finally apologized in person, and Emperor Jing did not blame him.

Wang Sheng was skilled in Huang-Lao philosophy and was a recluse. Once summoned to the court, where the Three Excellencies and Nine Ministers were all present, Wang Sheng, an old man, said, "My socks are untied," and turned to Zhang Tingwei, saying, "Tie my socks for me!" Shizhi knelt and tied them. Afterward, someone asked Wang Sheng, "Why did you humiliate Zhang Tingwei in court, making him kneel to tie your socks?" Wang Sheng said, "I am old and of low status, and I know I will ultimately be of no benefit to Zhang Tingwei. Zhang Tingwei is now a famous minister throughout the realm, so I deliberately humiliated him by making him kneel to tie my socks, wishing to enhance his reputation." When the nobles heard of this, they admired Wang Sheng and respected Zhang Tingwei even more.

Zhang Tingwei served Emperor Jing for over a year before becoming the Prime Minister of the King of Huainan, still bearing his previous fault. After a long time, Shizhi died. His son was Zhang Zhi, with the courtesy name Changgong, who rose to the rank of Da Fu but was dismissed. Unable to adapt to the times, he never served in office again.

Feng Tang was a native of Zhao. His grandfather moved to Dai, and after the rise of Han, to Anling. Feng Tang was renowned for his filial piety and served as the Chief of the Zhonglang Office under Emperor Wen. Once, when Emperor Wen passed by in his carriage, he asked Feng Tang, "Why is an elder like you serving as a gentleman? Where is your home?" Feng Tang answered truthfully. Emperor Wen said, "When I was in Dai, my Imperial Food Supervisor Gao Qu often spoke to me of the excellence of the Zhao general Li Qi, who fought at Julu. Now, whenever I eat, my thoughts are often at Julu. Do you know of him?" Feng Tang replied, "He is not as good as Lian Po or Li Mu as a general." The emperor asked, "Why?" Feng Tang said, "My grandfather was a commander in Zhao and was close to Li Mu. My father was the former Prime Minister of Dai and was close to the Zhao general Li Qi, so I know their characters." After hearing about Lian Po and Li Mu, the emperor was pleased and slapped his thigh, saying, "Alas! If only I had Lian Po and Li Mu as my generals, I would not worry about the Xiongnu!" Feng Tang said, "Your servant! Even if Your Majesty had Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them." The emperor, angered, rose and entered the palace. After a long time, he summoned Feng Tang and reproached him, "Why did you publicly humiliate me? Could you not have done so in private?" Feng Tang apologized, "I am a commoner and did not know to avoid taboos."

At that time, the Xiongnu had just launched a major invasion into Chaona, killing the Commander of Beidi, Ang. The emperor was concerned about the Hu invaders and finally asked Feng Tang again, "How do you know I cannot use Lian Po and Li Mu?" Feng Tang replied, "I have heard that when ancient kings sent forth their generals, they would kneel and push the chariot wheel, saying, 'Within the gates, I control; outside the gates, the general controls. Military promotions and rewards are all decided on the front lines and reported afterward.' This is not empty talk. My grandfather said that when Li Mu was a general defending the border for Zhao, the taxes from the military markets were all used to feast the soldiers, and rewards were decided on the front lines without interference from the court. Entrusted with responsibility and held accountable for success, Li Mu was able to fully utilize his abilities, selecting 1,300 chariots, 13,000 archers on horseback, and 100,000 skilled warriors, thus driving the Chanyu north, defeating the Donghu, annihilating the Danlin, suppressing the strong Qin in the west, and supporting Han and Wei in the south. At that time, Zhao was nearly hegemonic. Later, when King Qian of Zhao ascended the throne, his mother was a singer. King Qian, upon ascending the throne, listened to the slander of Guo Kai and finally executed Li Mu, replacing him with Yan Ju. As a result, the army was defeated, and the soldiers fled, leading to Zhao's capture and annihilation by Qin. Now, I have heard that Wei Shang is the Commander of Yunzhong, and the taxes from his military markets are all used to feast the soldiers. He uses his private funds to buy oxen every five days to feast guests, military officers, and attendants, thus the Xiongnu keep their distance and do not approach the Yunzhong fortifications. Once, the enemy invaded, and Wei Shang led his chariots and cavalry to attack, killing many. The soldiers are all commoners' sons, drafted from the fields into the army. How do they know about military records and muster rolls? They fight all day, beheading enemies and capturing prisoners, reporting their achievements to the military headquarters, yet if one word is out of place, petty officials punish them according to the law. Their rewards are not granted, yet officials strictly enforce the law. I am foolish, but I believe that Your Majesty's laws are too strict, rewards too light, and punishments too severe. Moreover, the Commander of Yunzhong, Wei Shang, was punished for a discrepancy of six enemy heads in his report, and Your Majesty handed him over to the officials, stripping him of his rank and sentencing him to penal servitude. From this, Your Majesty, even if you had Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them. I am truly foolish and have spoken without regard for taboos, a capital crime!" Emperor Wen was pleased. That day, he ordered Feng Tang to hold the imperial节 (symbol of authority) and pardon Wei Shang, reinstating him as Commander of Yunzhong, and appointed Feng Tang as Cheqi Duwei, in charge of the central guard and the chariot soldiers of the commanderies and kingdoms.

In the seventh year, Emperor Jing ascended the throne and appointed Feng Tang as the Prime Minister of Chu, but he was dismissed. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne and sought virtuous and talented individuals, Feng Tang was recommended. At that time, Feng Tang was over ninety years old and could no longer serve in office, so his son Feng Sui was appointed as a gentleman. Feng Sui, with the courtesy name Wangsun, was also a remarkable man and was friendly with me.

The Grand Historian says: Zhang Ji's words about men of integrity and his adherence to the law without flattery; Feng Gong's discourse on generals—how flavorful! How flavorful! The saying goes, "If you do not know a man, look at his friends." The men praised by these two can be enshrined in the ancestral temple. The Book says, "Without bias or favoritism, the royal way is vast; without favoritism or bias, the royal way is smooth." Zhang Ji and Feng Gong come close to this ideal. [end of text]
