**Q1: Summary of the story (5 points)**  
The story depicts how the cunning and ambitious Weizhenbao, who served as the magistrate of Ye, orchestrated the practice of offering women to the mythical god of the river, Bahe. This practice was carried out by the local elders, officials, and a powerful witch, who falsely claimed to select women for Bahe's marriage. The process involved elaborate rituals, including bathing, dressing, and transporting the women to the river. Despite the deception, the ritual was carried out, and the women were eventually drowned. After the incident, Weizhenbao built twelve irrigation channels to benefit the people of Ye, ensuring their survival and prosperity. His actions earned him a reputation as a capable ruler, though his methods were controversial.

**Q2: Type of women victims (2 points)**  
The women who were victims were typically poor and marginalized. They were chosen by the powerful elites (elders, officials, and the witch) for their status, wealth, or social standing. The process was designed to ensure that these women would not resist or challenge the ritual, as their social position made them vulnerable to exploitation and eventual drowning.

**Q3: Beneficiaries of the old practice (2 points)**  
The old practice of offering women to Bahe was intended to benefit the powerful elites, including the Weizhenbao himself, the local officials, and the wealthy families. These groups gained wealth and influence by controlling the selection and execution of the ritual, while the poor and marginalized women were exploited and harmed.

**Q4: Wits or force used by the protagonist (5 points)**  
The protagonist, Weizhenbao, used a combination of wits and force to deal with the situation. He first exploited the social hierarchy and the fear of the powerful to carry out the ritual. He convinced the elites and the witch to participate in the deception, using their authority and fear to ensure their compliance. When the ritual was completed and the women were drowned, he used force to intimidate the witnesses and ensure that the truth was not revealed. Later, he used his political acumen to build irrigation channels, which benefited the people and earned him a reputation as a capable ruler.

**Q5: Moral perspective on the protagonist's actions (10 points)**  
From a traditional moral perspective, Weizhenbao's actions are seen as morally questionable. By orchestrating the ritual and exploiting the vulnerable, he violated the rights and dignity of the poor women. However, his subsequent efforts to build irrigation channels and improve the lives of the people of Ye can be seen as morally justifiable. He used his power to bring relief and prosperity to the community, which may outweigh the harm caused by the ritual. From a modern perspective, his actions highlight the dangers of corruption and the abuse of power, as well as the importance of respecting the dignity and rights of others. His story serves as a cautionary tale about the consequences of moral decay and the need for ethical leadership.

**Q6: Explanation of the comment and fairness (15 points)**  
The comment from the *Hanshuo Zianzhuan* ("傳曰：「子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。」三子之才能誰最賢哉？辨治者當能別之。") suggests that while all three men—Sun Quan, Su Zibo, and Xi Menbao—achieved remarkable success in their respective governance, their methods and moral character differed. Sun Quan and Su Zibo were known for their ethical leadership and fairness, earning the respect of the people. In contrast, Xi Menbao was seen as cunning and corrupt, relying on manipulation and exploitation to maintain his power. The comment argues that true leadership requires distinguishing between ethical and unethical methods. Whether the comment is fair depends on one's perspective. From a traditional view, it aligns with the values of justice and fairness, praising Sun Quan and Su Zibo while criticizing Xi Menbao. From a modern perspective, it reflects a broader understanding of leadership that values integrity and ethical decision-making over personal gain and manipulation. The comment is fair in highlighting the importance of ethical leadership but may oversimplify the complexity of human nature and governance.
