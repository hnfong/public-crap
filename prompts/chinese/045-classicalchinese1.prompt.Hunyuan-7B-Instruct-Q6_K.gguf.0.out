**Q1: Summary of the story (5 points)**  
The story depicts how the legendary figure of Ximen Bao, a cunning and ruthless ruler, exploited the people of Ye to enrich himself. He orchestrated the practice of offering girls to the mythical god of the river, He Bo, to create a demand for their marriage. This practice caused widespread fear, poverty, and displacement of families. Bao then used his power to divert the water from the Yellow River to irrigate the fields, benefiting the people and earning his reputation as a great leader.

**Q2: Type of women victims (2 points)**  
The women who were victims were typically poor or marginalized in society, often from families who were already struggling due to the exploitation of their children.

**Q3: Beneficiaries of the old practice (2 points)**  
The old practice benefited the powerful elite, including Bao himself, the officials, and the wealthy families who could afford to sponsor the lavish gifts and maintain their status.

**Q4: Wits vs. Force (5 points)**  
The protagonist, Ximen Bao, primarily used his wits and manipulation to deal with the situation. He exploited the fear and desperation of the people, convincing them to comply with his demands. When resistance arose, he used force, such as sending people to the river and threatening them with punishment. His success was a combination of cunning, intimidation, and the willingness to use force when necessary.

**Q5: Moral perspective (10 points)**  
From a traditional moral viewpoint, Ximen Bao's actions are condemned as unethical and cruel. He exploited the vulnerable, caused immense suffering, and violated the rights of the people. However, from a utilitarian perspective, his actions might be seen as beneficial in the short term, as it provided immediate relief to the people by providing food and water. The debate hinges on the balance between immediate benefits and long-term consequences, as well as the ethical implications of his methods.

**Q6: Interpretation of the comment (15 points)**  
The comment compares the leadership of three historical figures: Su Zai of Zheng, Su Yi of Shanfu, and Ximen Bao of Wei. It suggests that while all three were capable of governing effectively, their methods and moral character differed. Su Zai and Su Yi are praised for their integrity and fairness, while Ximen Bao is criticized for his cruelty and exploitation. The comment implies that true leadership requires distinguishing between competence and morality. Whether the comment is fair depends on one's perspective: while Ximen Bao's methods were undoubtedly effective, his lack of empathy and respect for the people makes his leadership less admirable than that of Su Zai and Su Yi.
