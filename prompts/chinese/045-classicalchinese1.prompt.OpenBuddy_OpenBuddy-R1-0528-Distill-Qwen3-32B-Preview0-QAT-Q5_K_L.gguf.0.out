Q1: The story is about a wise and just leader named 西门豹 who becomes the governor of 邺. He discovers that the people are suffering because they are forced to offer their daughters to the river god 河伯 every year. 西门豹 uses his wit to expose the corruption of the local officials and the false beliefs of the people. He then leads the people to build a system of irrigation channels that brings prosperity to the region.

Q2: The victims were usually young and beautiful women from poor families.

Q3: The local officials, including the three elders, the court officials, and the wealthy landowners, benefited from the old practice of offering girls.

Q4: The protagonist used wits to deal with the situation. He pretended to support the old practice of offering girls to 河伯, but then used it as an opportunity to expose the corruption of the local officials and the false beliefs of the people. He also used his authority to build a system of irrigation channels that brought prosperity to the region.

Q5: From the perspective of the people, it was moral for 西门豹 to do so because he was protecting their daughters from being sacrificed to a false god and bringing prosperity to the region. From the perspective of the local officials, it was immoral because they were losing their source of income and power. From the perspective of the river god 河伯, it was immoral because 西门豹 was challenging his authority and disrupting the natural order.

Q6: The comment means that 西门豹 is considered one of the three most capable and virtuous leaders in Chinese history, along with 子产 and 子賤. The comment is fair because 西门豹's actions demonstrate his wisdom, justice, and compassion for the people. He was able to expose the corruption of the local officials and the false beliefs of the people, and then lead them to build a system of irrigation channels that brought prosperity to the region. His legacy continues to inspire people today. [end of text]
