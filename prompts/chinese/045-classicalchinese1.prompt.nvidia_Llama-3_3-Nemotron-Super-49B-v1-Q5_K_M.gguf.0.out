### Q1: Summary of the Story (5 points)
**Summary (5/5)**
West Gate General Xi Men Bian, as the governor of Yi (邺), discovered that the local tradition of "marrying off the River God" involved extorting money from citizens and sacrificing their daughters. He cleverly stopped this practice by pretending to participate, then drowning the shamans and officials involved, instead redirecting efforts to build irrigation canals, benefiting the people.

### Q2: Victims in the Story (2 points)
**Victims (2/2)**
Young, attractive girls from ordinary families, feared being chosen for the river god.

### Q3: Beneficiaries of the Old Practice (2 points)
**Beneficiaries (2/2)**
Three Elders (三老), Court Officials (廷掾), and Shamans (巫祝) who shared the extorted money.

### Q4: Protagonist's Approach (5 points)
**Approach (5/5)**
- **Initial Method**: Wits (pretending to participate in the ritual)
- **Resolution**: Force (drowning the shamans and officials to stop the practice)

### Q5: Morality of the Protagonist's Actions (10 points)
**Morality Views (10/10)**

- **Utilitarian Perspective**: **Moral** - Greatest good for the greatest number; ended harmful tradition, brought prosperity.
- **Deontological Perspective**: **Immoral** - Violated moral duties (right to life) of the shamans and officials.
- **Cultural/Pragmatic Perspective**: **Moral** - Effective in stopping a deeply ingrained, harmful practice within the cultural context.
- **Modern Human Rights Perspective**: **Immoral** - Violation of human rights (arbitrary killing).

### Q6: Interpretation and Fairness of the Comment (15 points)
**Interpretation & Fairness (15/15)**

- **Meaning**:
  - The comment compares the governance styles of three historical figures:
    - **Zi Chan (子產)**: Ruled Zheng, people couldn’t cheat (implying strict, just rule).
    - **Zi Xian (子賤)**: Ruled Single Father, people didn’t dare to cheat out of respect/admiration.
    - **Xi Men Bian (西門豹)**: Ruled Yi, people dared not cheat out of fear.
  - **Question**: Which of the three was the most wise/gifted in governance?
  - **Answer Provided in Text**: The commentator suggests that a true evaluator of governance should be able to distinguish between these approaches, implying Xi Men Bian's method, though effective in immediate impact, might not be considered the most wise or gifted in the long term or ethically, as it relied on fear.

- **Fairness of the Comment**:
  - **Fair in Context**: Yes, as it prompts a nuanced discussion on governance styles and their implications.
  - **Potential Bias**: Might undervalue the immediate, drastic positive change Xi Men Bian achieved in a corrupt system, focusing more on the method than the outcome. **Fairness Score: 8/10** (considering the context and the potential for subjective interpretation of "wisdom" in governance).
