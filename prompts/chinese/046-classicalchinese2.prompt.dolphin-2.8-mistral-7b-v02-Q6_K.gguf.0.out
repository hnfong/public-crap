This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

(1) Translation:

When Wei Wuhou was devising strategies, his ministers could not catch on. He left the audience chamber with a smile. Wu Qi advanced and said, "Have you ever heard the speech of the Marquis of Qi?" Wei Wuhou asked, "What is the speech of the Marquis of Qi?" Wu Qi replied, "The Marquis of Qi devises strategies and succeeds, but his ministers cannot catch on, and he leaves the audience chamber with a worried look. The minister Xunzi advanced and asked, "Why is there a worried look at court?" The Marquis of Qi said, "There is no harvest, and he devises strategies and succeeds, but his ministers cannot catch on, so he is worried. The words of the Duke of Zhou are appropriate, which says, 'The ruler who gets troops is a king, who gets friends is a hegemon, who gets doubts is still alive, and who devises strategies without knowing how to use it is lost.' Today, without harvest, and yet his ministers cannot catch on, what will be left of my country? That is why he is worried." The Marquis of Qi is worried, and his minister is happy.

(2) Moral of the story:

The story tells us that a wise leader should always listen to the advice of his ministers and take their opinions into consideration. Even if they are not always right, their insights can be valuable in helping the leader make better decisions. It also highlights the importance of being prepared for the unexpected and not relying solely on one's own strategies.

(3) Counterpart in Western thought:

The concept of a wise leader taking advice from his ministers can be found in Western thought as well, particularly in the works of Plato and Aristotle. In Plato's "Republic," the philosopher-king is advised by a council of wise men and women, while Aristotle emphasizes the importance of the ruler being able to listen to and learn from others in his book "Politics." Additionally, the concept of a leader not relying solely on their own strategies can be found in the works of Sun Tzu, who emphasizes the importance of flexibility and adaptability in warfare.<|im_end|>
