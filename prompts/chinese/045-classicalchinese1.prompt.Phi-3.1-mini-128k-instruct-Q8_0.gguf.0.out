Consider the following text from 滑稽列传 and answer questions:

```
魏文侯时，西门豹为邺令。豹往到邺，会长老，问之民所疾苦。长老曰：「苦为河伯娶妇，以故贫。」豹问其故，对曰：「邺三老、廷掾常岁赋敛百姓，收取其钱得数百万，用其二三十万为河伯娶妇，与祝巫共分其余钱持归。当其时，巫行视小家女好者，云是当为河伯妇，即娉取。洗沐之，为治新缯绮縠衣，闲居斋戒；为治斋宫河上，张缇绛帷，女居其中。为具牛酒饭食，行十余日。共粉饰之，如嫁女床席，令女居其上，浮之河中。始浮，行数十里乃没。其人家有好女者，恐大巫祝为河伯取之，以故多持女远逃亡。以故城中益空无人，又困贫，所从来久远矣。民人俗语曰『即不为河伯娶妇，水来漂没，溺其人民』云。」西门豹曰：「至为河伯娶妇时，愿三老、巫祝、父老送女河上，幸来告语之，吾亦往送女。」皆曰：「诺。」

至其时，西门豹往会之河上。三老、官属、豪长者、里父老皆会，以人民往观之者三二千人。其巫，老女子也，已年七十。从弟子女十人所，皆衣缯单衣，立大巫后。西门豹曰：「呼河伯妇来，视其好丑。」即将女出帷中，来至前。豹视之，顾谓三老、巫祝、父老曰：「是女子不好，烦大巫妪为入报河伯，得更求好女，后日送之。」即使吏卒共抱大巫妪投之河中。有顷，曰：「巫妪何久也？弟子趣之！」复以弟子一人投河中。有顷，曰：「弟子何久也？复使一人趣之！」复投一弟子河中。凡投三弟子。西门豹曰：「巫妪弟子是女子也，不能白事，烦三老为入白之。」复投三老河中。西门豹簪笔磬折，向河立待良久。长老、吏傍观者皆惊恐。西门豹顾曰：「巫妪、三老不来还，柰之何？」欲复使廷掾与豪长者一人入趣之。皆叩头，叩头且破，额血流地，色如死灰。西门豹曰：「诺，且留待之须臾。」须臾，豹曰：「廷掾起矣。状河伯留客之久，若皆罢去归矣。」邺吏民大惊恐，从是以后，不敢复言为河伯娶妇。

西门豹即发民凿十二渠，引河水灌民田，田皆溉。当其时，民治渠少烦苦，不欲也。豹曰：「民可以乐成，不可与虑始。今父老子弟虽患苦我，然百岁后期令父老子孙思我言。」至今皆得水利，民人以给足富。十二渠经绝驰道，到汉之立，而长吏以为十二渠桥绝驰道，相比近，不可。欲合渠水，且至驰道合三渠为一桥。邺民人父老不肯听长吏，以为西门君所为也，贤君之法式不可更也。长吏终听置之。故西门豹为邺令，名闻天下，泽流后世，无绝已时，几可谓非贤大夫哉！
