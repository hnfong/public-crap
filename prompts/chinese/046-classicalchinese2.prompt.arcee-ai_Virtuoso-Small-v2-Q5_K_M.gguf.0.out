(1) Here is the English translation of the story:

魏武侯 (Wei Wuhou) was planning something and his decision was correct, and none of his ministers could match him. After the court session, he had a pleased expression. Wu Qi (吳起) approached and said, "Have you ever heard of the words of Chu Zhuangwang (楚莊王) from the left and right sides?" Wei Wuhou asked, "What were the words of Chu Zhuangwang like?" Wu Qi replied, "Chu Zhuangwang was planning something and his decision was correct, and none of his ministers could match him. After the court session, he had a worried expression. Shen Gong Wuchen (申公巫臣) asked, 'Why do you have a worried expression after the court session?' Chu Zhuangwang said, 'I planned something and my decision was correct, and none of my ministers could match me, so I am worried. It is as the words of Zhong Yi (中蘬) said, 'If a ruler can find a teacher for himself, he will become a king; if he can find a friend, he will become a hegemon; if he can find a rival, he will survive; if he plans something and no one can match him, he will perish.' Now, with my lack of talent, and none of my ministers can match me, my country is almost perishing. That is why I am worried.' Chu Zhuangwang was worried, but you are pleased." Wei Wuhou, after hearing this, bowed twice and said, "It is as if heaven sent you to correct my mistake."

(2) The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should be humble and cautious, even when he is successful. Wei Wuhou was pleased with his own decision, but Wu Qi reminded him of Chu Zhuangwang's story, which showed that a ruler should be worried when he is the only one who can make a correct decision. This is because it means that the ruler's ministers are not competent enough, and the ruler's country may be in danger. The story emphasizes the importance of humility and the need to be aware of potential dangers.

(3) The concepts in the story have counterparts in Western (European) thought. The idea of a ruler being humble and cautious, even when successful, can be found in the works of philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. Plato, in his work "The Republic," emphasized the importance of a ruler being just and wise, and not being swayed by personal pride or pleasure. Aristotle, in his work "Politics," also stressed the importance of a ruler being humble and not being overconfident in his own abilities. The idea of a ruler being aware of potential dangers and taking steps to prevent them is also a common theme in Western political thought. For example, Machiavelli, in his work "The Prince," emphasized the importance of a ruler being aware of potential threats and taking steps to prevent them. Overall, the concepts in the story are consistent with many of the ideas found in Western political thought. [end of text]
