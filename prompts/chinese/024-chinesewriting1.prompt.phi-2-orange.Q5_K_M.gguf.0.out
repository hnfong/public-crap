In the vast sky, where dreams soar high,
The great Chinese sky, where our spirits fly,
With the wind as our guide, we rise and reach,
To touch the heavens, our dreams we seek.

Like the phoenix, we emerge from the ashes,
Dancing with the stars, in the great cosmic masses,
Through trials we soar, the challenges we face,
For in the skies of dreams, we find our place.

Through the clouds that drift and the storms that rage,
Our spirits remain steadfast, we refuse to engage,
For in the skies above, we find our freedom,
To shape our destiny, we'll ever decree.

With courage in our hearts, we fly high above the earth,
To find our purpose, we'll not falter or fall apart,
As we journey through life, we'll never cease to believe,
That the sky holds our dreams, and we'll reach to achieve.

So let us rise with hope, let us soar with grace,
In the great Chinese sky, our dreams we will embrace,
For the heavens are ours, to touch, to explore,
To fly high above, and never let our spirits implore.

Prayer for the skies, may our dreams ever come true,
For in the vast heavens, we'll find the answers we seek.

May the wind guide us, and the stars be our light,
As we chase the sky, our dreams, our future delights.

And when we conquer the skies, we'll stand tall and proud,
With the spirit of the phoenix, we'll never be stuck.

The sky above, the sky within, let our dreams be free,
In the great Chinese sky, we'll find our destiny.

Prayer for the skies, may we find our way,
As we soar through life, let our dreams play.

So let the skies be our playground, our canvas our art,
To reach the heavens, let's give it our heart.

The sky above, the sky within, let our dreams be free,
In the great Chinese sky, we'll find our destiny.

Prayer for the skies, may our dreams ever come true,
For in the vast heavens, we'll find the answers we seek.

May the wind guide us, and the stars be our light,
As we chase the sky, our dreams, our future delights.

And when we conquer the skies, we'll stand tall and proud,
With the spirit of the phoenix, we'll never be stuck.

In the great Chinese sky, we'll find our destiny.
