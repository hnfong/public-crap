This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

Here's a translation of the story:

When the Marquis of Wei was planning something and the ministers could not catch it, he left the court with a smile on his face. Wu Qi, from the state of Wu, asked: "Isn't there a saying about the Duke of Chu? It's something you've heard from your elders." The Marquis of Wei asked: "What is the Duke of Chu's saying?" Wu Qi replied: "The Duke of Chu, when planning something, could not be caught by his ministers, and left the court with a worried expression. One of his ministers, the Duke's shaman, asked him: 'Why are you worried, Your Majesty?' The Duke of Chu replied: 'I am worried because, when there is no grain, I cannot be caught by my ministers, and they cannot understand my plans. It is said: "The lords obtain their armies by themselves, their allies by themselves, and their safety by themselves. Those who scheme but cannot be imitated by others will die." Now, because of the lack of grain, my ministers cannot understand my plans. I am worried that our state will be destroyed! That is why I am worried.' The Duke of Chu was worried, while his lord was happy. The Marquis of Wei made a round of bows and said: "Heaven helps the one who corrects his own mistakes."

Here's an explanation of the moral of the story:

The moral of the story is that it is important to be cautious and not to reveal too much of one's plans, as others may not understand them and may misinterpret them. It is also important to recognize one's own mistakes and correct them.

Here's a discussion of whether the concepts in the story have a counterpart in Western (European) thought:

The concept of being cautious and not revealing too much of one's plans is a universal concept that can be found in many cultures, including Western thought. For example, in the European tradition, Sun Tzu's "The Art of War" emphasizes the importance of deception and secrecy in warfare. The concept of recognizing and correcting one's own mistakes is also a universal concept, and can be found in many philosophical and self-help traditions in the West, such as the idea of self-reflection and personal growth.

In terms of the specific details of the story, such as the role of the shaman and the Duke's worried expression, these may be more specific to Chinese culture and thought. However, the broader moral lessons of the story are universal and can be applied in many different cultural contexts.

Overall, while the specific details of the story may be more specific to Chinese culture, the broader moral lessons and concepts in the story have counterparts in Western thought.

Here are some additional details about the story and its context:

The story is from the "Book of Master Zhuang," a collection of stories and anecdotes from ancient China, attributed to the philosopher Zhuang Zhou. The book is part of the larger "Five Classics" of Chinese philosophy, which also includes the "Book of Changes," the "Book of Rites," the "Book of Music," and the "Spring and Autumn Annals."

The Marquis of Wei and the Duke of Chu were both high-ranking officials in the state of Wei during the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history, around the 8th to 5th centuries BCE. The Spring and Autumn period was a time of political and military conflict, and the stories in the "Book of Master Zhuang" reflect the complex and often treacherous nature of politics during this time.

The concept of recognizing and correcting one's own mistakes is a key theme in many philosophical and self-help traditions in the West, such as the idea of self-reflection and personal growth. For example, in the European tradition, the philosopher Socrates emphasized the importance of self-knowledge and self-improvement, and the idea of the "examined life" is a central theme in his philosophy. Similarly, in the Christian tradition, the concept of confession and repentance is a way of recognizing and correcting one's own mistakes and seeking forgiveness and spiritual growth.

Overall, while the specific details of the story may be more specific to Chinese culture, the broader moral lessons and concepts in the story have counterparts in Western thought.
