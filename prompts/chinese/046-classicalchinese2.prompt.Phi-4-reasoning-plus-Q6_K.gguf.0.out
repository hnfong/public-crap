User asks: "This is a passage from 荀子: ..." then text passage in Chinese. The passage is from Xunzi (荀子) I believe. The passage is:

"魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

We need to produce answer with three parts:

(1) Translate the story into English. We can keep proper names in Chinese.

(2) Explain what the moral of the story is.

(3) Does the concepts in the story have a counterpart in Western (European) thought?

Let's check the passage carefully.

I'll re-read the passage:

"魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

Let's break it down:

- "魏武侯" is a ruler of the state of Wei, known as "Wu Hou" (武侯) of Wei. He is planning matters (謀事) and his decisions are correct (當), and his ministers (群臣) are not able to match his wisdom (莫能逮). After the court meeting (退朝), he shows a happy expression (有喜色). Then, "吳起" (Wu Qi) steps forward and says: "Have you ever heard of the words of Chu Zhuang Wang (楚莊王) from those around him?" The ruler of Wei (武侯) asks: "What are the words of Chu Zhuang Wang like?" Wu Qi replies: "Chu Zhuang Wang, when planning matters, his decisions are correct, and his ministers are not able to match him, but after the court meeting he shows a worried expression (有憂色). Then, Shen Gong Wu Chen (申公巫臣) approaches and asks: 'Why do you, my lord, appear worried after the court meeting?' Chu Zhuang Wang replies: 'Because I, though my decisions are correct and my ministers are not able to match me, I worry because of the words of Zhong Luan (中蘬) which say: "For the feudal lords, if they get a teacher, they become kings; if they get a friend, they become hegemon; if they get suspicion, they survive; but if they rely solely on their own counsel and no one can advise them, they will perish." Now, because I am unworthy (不肖) and my ministers are not able to match me, our state is nearly ruined! That is why I worry.' Chu Zhuang Wang worries, while you, my lord, rejoice." Then, the ruler of Wei (武侯) bows twice (逡巡再拜) and says: "Heaven has made you, sir, to correct my faults."

So the story is about two rulers: Chu Zhuang Wang and Wei Wu Hou. Chu Zhuang Wang, despite his wise decisions, worries because he recognizes that his ministers are not able to advise him properly, and he fears that his state might fall because he is relying solely on his own judgment. In contrast, Wei Wu Hou, when his decisions are correct and his ministers are not able to match him, he rejoices. Wu Qi then compares the two, and Wei Wu Hou acknowledges that his own behavior is flawed and thanks Wu Qi for correcting him.

The moral of the story is about the importance of humility and the value of having advisors who can provide counsel. Chu Zhuang Wang's worry is seen as a virtue because he recognizes that his own infallibility might lead to the downfall of his state if he does not listen to others. In contrast, Wei Wu Hou's rejoicing in his own wisdom is seen as arrogance and a potential cause for downfall. The story teaches that a ruler should be cautious and humble, and should value the input of others, rather than being complacent in his own abilities.

Now, does the concept in the story have a counterpart in Western (European) thought? Yes, there are similar ideas in Western philosophy, such as the idea of the "wise ruler" who is aware of his own limitations, the importance of counsel, and the dangers of hubris. For example, in Plato's "Republic", the philosopher-king is expected to be wise and to seek counsel. Also, in Machiavelli's "The Prince", there is an emphasis on the ruler's need to
