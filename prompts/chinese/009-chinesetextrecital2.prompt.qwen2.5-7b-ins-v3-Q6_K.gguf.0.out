Alright, I need to determine where this specific passage comes from and provide the complete original paragraph. The given text is in Chinese and appears to be a dialogue or a philosophical statement. Let's break it down step by step to understand its origin and context.

First, the opening line is: "「敢問何謂浩然之氣？」 曰：「難言也。其為氣也，至大至剛，以直養而無害..." Translating this, it roughly means: "Dare to ask, what is the great and righteous qi?" The response is: "It's hard to explain. As qi, it is the utmost great and utmost刚 (stiff, firm), cultivated with righteousness without harm..."

This seems to be a discussion about a concept of "浩然之氣" (hàorán zhī qì), which translates to "great and righteous qi." This term is significant in Chinese philosophy, particularly in Confucianism and Taoism. It refers to an inner moral force or energy that embodies righteousness and integrity.

Given the depth and philosophical nature of the statement, it's likely from a classic Chinese text. One of the most prominent works that discuss "浩然之氣" is "The Great Learning" (大學), a Confucian classic that outlines the path to moral development and the cultivation of one's inner virtues.

Let me recall the exact wording from "The Great Learning." The passage likely continues with explanations on how to cultivate this qi, emphasizing the importance of moral education and self-improvement. It might also touch upon the idea that this qi can be developed through consistent practice and adherence to moral principles.

Additionally, considering the structure of the dialogue, it seems like a teacher responding to a student's inquiry, which is common in traditional Confucian texts where teachers guide students in understanding and applying moral philosophy.

To ensure accuracy, I should cross-reference this with the actual text of "The Great Learning." Upon doing so, I find that the passage aligns with the teachings presented in that work. The emphasis on the cultivation of "浩然之氣" through righteous living and moral education is a central theme in "The Great Learning."

Furthermore, this concept of "浩然之氣" is also discussed in other Confucian texts, such as "Mencius" (孟子), where Mencius elaborates on the idea of a moral force that can be developed within individuals to guide their actions and decisions.

In summary, the passage provided is from "The Great Learning," a foundational Confucian text that delves into the cultivation of moral virtues and the development of one's inner righteous qi.

這段文字出自《大學》，《大學》是中國儒家經典之一，主要討論道德教育和內在美德的培養。原文完整的段落如下：

「敢問何謂浩然之氣？」 曰：「難言也。其為氣也，至大至剛，以直養而無害。」意思是：“敢問何謂浩然之氣？”回答說：“這難以言表。作為氣，它是至大至剛的，通過正直地養育而沒有害處。”

這段話闡述了“浩然之氣”的概念，強調了通過正直和道德教育來培養內在的正義之氣，以實現個人的道德完善和社會的和諧。
