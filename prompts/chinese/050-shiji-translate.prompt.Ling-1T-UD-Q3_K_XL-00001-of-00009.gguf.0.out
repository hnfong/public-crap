The Biography of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang

Zhang Shizhi, the Commandant of the Imperial Guards, was from Duyang, styled Gongzi. He had an elder brother named Zhong with whom he lived. Through family wealth he became a Cavalry Attendant and served Emperor Wen of Han. For ten years he was not promoted and remained unknown. Zhang Shizhi said: “A long career in office diminishes my brother’s estate; this is not right.” He wished to resign and return home. Zhonglang General Yuan Ang, knowing his worth, regretted his departure and requested that Zhang Shizhi be reassigned as a Palace Attendant. After Zhang Shizhi had an audience, he spoke informally of matters advantageous to the state. Emperor Wen said: “Speak in practical terms, not grand theories, so that what is said may be put into practice now.” Thereupon, Zhang Shizhi discussed events between the Qin and Han, analyzing why Qin fell and Han rose, at length. Emperor Wen approved and appointed him Palace Attendant Director.

When Zhang Shizhi accompanied the emperor on an outing and ascended the Tiger Enclosure, the emperor questioned the Upper Park Commandant about the registers of birds and beasts, asking more than ten questions. The commandant glanced left and right, unable to answer. The tiger-keeper beside him answered the emperor’s questions about the animal registers in full detail, seeking to demonstrate his ability to respond fluently without pause. Emperor Wen said: “Should an officer be like this? The commandant is useless!” He was about to order Zhang Shizhi to promote the tiger-keeper to Upper Park Commandant. Zhang Shizhi interjected after some hesitation: “How does Your Majesty regard Jianghou Zhou Bo?” The emperor said: “He is an elder statesman.” He asked again: “And Dongyang Marquis Zhang Shixiang?” The emperor again said: “An elder statesman.” Zhang Shizhi said: “Zhou Bo and Zhang Shixiang are called elder statesmen, yet these two could hardly speak when presenting advice. Are we to value only those who chatter glibly like this tiger-keeper? Qin appointed scribes who competed in severity and haste, but their governance became mere formalities, devoid of benevolence. Thus, their errors went unheard, decline set in, and by the Second Emperor the realm collapsed. If Your Majesty promotes this tiger-keeper for his glib tongue, I fear all under heaven will follow suit, vying in eloquence over substance. And as the people are influenced by those above faster than a shadow, every action must be examined with care.” Emperor Wen said: “Good.” He stopped the appointment.

As the emperor boarded his carriage, he summoned Zhang Shizhi to ride alongside and slowly asked about the failings of Qin. Zhang Shizhi answered with frankness. Upon entering the palace, the emperor appointed him Commandant of the Palace Gates.

Soon after, the Crown Prince and Prince of Liang entered the palace gate in the same carriage, failing to dismount at the司马 Gate. Zhang Shizhi pursued and stopped them from entering the palace hall. He then impeached them for “disrespect in not dismounting at the public gate” and submitted the memorial. When Dowager Empress Bo heard this, Emperor Wen removed his cap and apologized: “I failed to discipline my sons.” The dowager then sent a messenger with an edict pardoning the crown prince and Prince of Liang, who were then permitted entry. Emperor Wen was impressed by Zhang Shizhi and appointed him a Grandee of the Guard.

Later, he was promoted to Zhonglang General. When accompanying the emperor to Ba Bridge, they stayed at a northern latrine. At this time, Consort Shen followed. The emperor pointed out the road to her and said: “This is the road to Handan.” He had Consort Shen play the zither while he sang along, his mood somber and grief-stricken. Looking to his ministers, he said: “Alas! If coffins were made of Beishan stone, sealed with hemp fibers and lacquer, could they ever be opened?” All around said: “Good.” Zhang Shizhi stepped forward: “If the tomb contains treasures, even Mount南山 cannot keep robbers out; if it holds nothing desirable, even a coffin without stone, what sorrow is there?” The emperor praised this. Later, he appointed Zhang Shizhi as Commandant of Justice.

Once, when the emperor passed through the Central Wei Bridge, a man darted out from under the bridge, startling the imperial carriage’s horses. The emperor ordered a cavalry arrest and had the case referred to the Commandant of Justice. Zhang Shizhi interrogated the man, who said: “A local man, hearing the imperial procession, hid beneath the bridge. After a long while, thinking it had passed, he came out and saw the carriage and horses, then fled.” By law, the offense of startling the imperial horses carried a fine. Emperor Wen was angry: “This man endangered my horses! My horse was gentle; had it been another, I might have been thrown and hurt! Yet you sentence him only to a fine?” Zhang Shizhi said: “The law is what the Son of Heaven shares with all under heaven. If the law prescribes a fine yet you would increase the punishment, the law loses the people’s trust. Had Your Majesty ordered his immediate execution, that would have been one thing. But now that the case is with the Commandant of Justice, who upholds fairness for the realm—if his judgment tilts, all legal decisions become heavier or lighter by comparison. Where then shall the people set their hands and feet? I beg Your Majesty to consider this.” After a long while, the emperor said: “The Commandant of Justice’s ruling is correct.”

Later, someone stole a jade ring from the shrine of the High Ancestor and was caught. Emperor Wen was enraged and referred the case to the Commandant of Justice. Zhang Shizhi, citing the law that those who steal imperial temple vessels should be sentenced to death by public execution, submitted the verdict. The emperor was furious: “This lawless wretch dared steal a temple vessel of the former emperor! I sent him to you hoping for his clan’s extermination, yet you rule by statute. This is not how I honor the ancestral temples!” Zhang Shizhi, removing his cap and bowing his head, apologized: “The law suffices as it stands. Even for equal crimes, severity is graded by circumstance. Now, to execute a whole clan for stealing a temple vessel, even if the law permitted it—suppose one in ten thousand, an ignorant man took a handful of earth from Changling Mound, what punishment would Your Majesty add beyond the law?” After some time, Emperor Wen and Empress Dowager Bo discussed this, and the Commandant of Justice’s ruling was accepted. At this time, the commander-in-chief Marquis Zhou Yafu and Marquis Wang Tianshi of Shan Dou, seeing Zhang Shizhi’s fair arguments, befriended him. Zhang Shizhi thus gained renown throughout the realm.

After Emperor Wen’s death, Emperor Jing succeeded. Zhang Shizhi, fearful, feigned illness and wished to resign, dreading execution if he stayed, yet uncertain if an apology would suffice. Following the advice of Wang Sheng, a recluse skilled in Huang-Lao thought, he finally apologized. Emperor Jing did not punish him.

Wang Sheng, an old man, once summoned to court where all ministers gathered, suddenly said: “My shoelace is loose,” then turned to Zhang Shizhi: “Tie it for me!” Zhang Shizhi knelt and tied it. Afterwards, someone asked Wang Sheng: “Why humiliate Zhang Shizhi by making him kneel?” Wang Sheng said: “I am old and lowly. I know I am of no use to him. But Zhang Shizhi is a famed minister under heaven; I wished to honor him by this small act.” When the ministers heard this, they admired Wang Sheng and esteemed Zhang Shizhi more.

Zhang Shizhi served Emperor Jing for over a year as Chancellor of Huainan, still burdened by past offenses. After some years, Zhang Shizhi died. His son Zhang Zhi, styled Zhanggong, reached Grandee of the Guard but was dismissed for failing to please those in power, and never took office again.

Feng Tang, his grandfather was from Zhao. His father moved to Dai. After Han was founded, the family settled in Anling. Feng Tang was known for filial piety and served as Palace Attendant Director under Emperor Wen. When the emperor passed by in his carriage, he asked Feng Tang: “Elder, how came you to be a palace attendant? Where is your home?” Feng Tang answered truthfully. The emperor said: “When I was in Dai, my food supervisor Gao Qu often praised Zhao general Li Qi’s valor at Julu. Now, whenever I eat, I think of Julu. Do you know of him?” Feng Tang replied: “He was not the equal of Lian Po or Li Mu as a general.” The emperor asked: “Why?” Feng Tang said: “My grandfather, in Zhao, was a captain under Li Mu. My father was chancellor of Dai and knew Li Qi. I know their characters.” The emperor, having heard of Lian Po and Li Mu, was pleased and struck his thigh: “Alas! I could never have Lian Po or Li Mu as my general in their time—how could I fear the Xiongnu?” Feng Tang said: “Your subject begs leave—Even if Your Majesty had Lian Po or Li Mu, you would not employ them.” The emperor, angry, rose and withdrew. After some time, he summoned Feng Tang and rebuked: “Why humiliate me in public? Cannot you speak in private?” Feng Tang apologized: “This unworthy one knows not taboos.”

At this time, the Xiongnu had just massively invaded Chaonu and killed Beidi Commandant Ang. The emperor, concerned with the northern raiders, again asked Feng Tang: “How do you know I would not employ Lian Po or Li Mu?” Feng Tang answered: “I have heard that when ancient kings dispatched generals, they knelt and pushed the chariot wheel, saying: ‘Within the gate, I control; beyond, the general decides.’ All military merit and rewards were decided in the field, reported only afterward. This is no empty talk. My grandfather said Li Mu, as Zhao general on the frontier, used market taxes to feast his soldiers; rewards were decided outside, not interfered from within. Entrusted and held accountable, Li Mu thus exerted his full ability, deploying 1,300 chariots, 13,000 archers, and 100,000 chosen troops. With these he drove the Xiongnu north, defeated the Donghu, destroyed the Linhu, checked powerful Qin to the west, and supported Han and Wei to the south. At that time, Zhao nearly achieved hegemony. Later, King Zhao You came to the throne, his mother a courtesan. After King You’s accession, Guo Kai’s slander led to Li Mu’s execution and Yan Ju replacing him. Thus the army was broken, the soldiers fled, and Zhao was captured and destroyed by Qin.

“Now I hear Wei Shang serves as Commandant of Yunzhong. He uses all market taxes to feast soldiers, keeps private funds, sacrifices a bull every five days for guests, officers, and retainers, so the Xiongnu keep distant and do not approach Yunzhong’s passes. Once, when raiders entered, Wei Shang led chariots and cavalry to attack, inflicting heavy losses. Those soldiers are the sons of commoners, tilling the fields before donning armor—how should they know military registers? They fight all day, take heads, capture prisoners, yet when reporting merit to headquarters, a single word out of place brings punishment by law. Rewards are not granted, yet the law is enforced strictly. I deem Your Majesty’s statutes too severe, rewards too light, punishments too heavy. Moreover, Wei Shang was demoted for overstating enemy kills by six heads; Your Majesty handed him to the officials, stripped his title, sentenced him to penal labor. From this, even if Your Majesty had Lian Po or Li Mu, you would not employ them. I am foolish, have broken taboos—deadly offense, deadly offense!” Emperor Wen was pleased. That day, he sent Feng Tang with the tally to pardon Wei Shang, restore him as Yunzhong Commandant, and appointed Feng Tang as Chariot and Cavalry Commandant, overseeing the capital and regional forces.

In the seventh year, Emperor Jing succeeded and made Feng Tang Chancellor of Chu, later dismissed. When Emperor Wu ascended, he sought worthies and recommended Feng Tang. Feng Tang was then over ninety and could not return to office, so Emperor Wu appointed Feng Sui, Feng Tang’s son, as a palace attendant. Feng Sui, styled Wangsun, was also an unusual man and was on good terms with me.

The Grand Historian says: Zhang Shizhi’s words reflected an elder statesman; he upheld the law without favoritism. Feng Tang’s discourse on generals was profound—how rich in meaning! As the saying goes: “To know a man, look at his friends.” The virtues these two are praised for belong in the temple of worthies. The Book says: “Impartial, not partial to party, the kingly way is vast; not partial, not biased, the kingly way is clear.” Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang approached this ideal. [end of text]
