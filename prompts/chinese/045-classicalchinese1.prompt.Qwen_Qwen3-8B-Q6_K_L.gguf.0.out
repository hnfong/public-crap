**Q1:**  
During the time of King Wen of Wei, Ximen Bao became the magistrate of YÃ¨. He discovered that the people were suffering from the ritual of offering girls to the river god Hebo. To expose the fraud, he pretended to join the ceremony, had the priestess and officials thrown into the river, and ended the practice. He then built irrigation canals, improving the people's livelihood.

**Q2:**  
The victims were usually poor, young women chosen by the priestess as suitable for the river god.

**Q3:**  
The local officials, priestess, and wealthy families benefited from the practice by taking a share of the money collected from the people.

**Q4:**  
Ximen Bao used **wits** rather than force. He cleverly pretended to support the ritual, then used it as a pretext to expose and eliminate the corrupt officials and priestess, thereby ending the harmful practice without causing direct violence.

**Q5:**  
- **From a moral standpoint**: Some may argue it was immoral to deceive and kill, even if the practice was harmful.  
- **From a pragmatic standpoint**: Others may see it as justified, as it ended a harmful tradition and protected the people.  
- **From a legal standpoint**: It may be seen as a violation of the law, as he used deception to punish officials.  
- **From a social reform standpoint**: It was a necessary action to end a corrupt and oppressive custom.  
- **From a human rights standpoint**: It involved violence and deception, which could be seen as unethical.

**Q6:**  
This passage means that Ximen Bao, like Zi Chan and Zi Jian, was a wise and effective leader who brought order and justice to his people. The comment suggests that the three were all virtuous, but it does not clearly state who was the most virtuous. The fairness of the comment depends on one's perspective: it is fair in acknowledging their achievements, but it lacks a clear evaluation of their relative merits. The statement is generally fair as it praises their leadership and impact on society. [end of text]
