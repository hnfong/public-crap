Zhang Shizi, a native of Doucheng, had the style of Jishi. He had an elder brother, Zhong, who lived with him. Zhang Shizi was appointed as a cavalryman and served Emperor Xiaowen of Han. He was ten years old and could not be assigned to a position, and he was unknown. Zhang Shizi said, "If I serve for a long time, I will be reduced to my brother's status, and I will not be able to fulfill my duties." He wanted to return home. The middle-ranking official Yuan An knew that Zhang Shizi was talented and regretted that he was leaving, so he asked to transfer Zhang Shizi to be a eunuch. Zhang Shizi had finished his duties and then spoke freely. Emperor Xiaowen said, "You, don't be too presumptuous, and don't speak too much. What can be implemented now?" Zhang Shizi then spoke about the affairs of Qin and Han, saying that Qin lost and Han gained because of the long period of time. Emperor Xiaowen praised him and appointed him as the eunuch in charge of the imperial seal.

Zhang Shizi followed the emperor and climbed the Tiger Enclosure. The emperor asked the officer in charge of the imperial menagerie about the list of animals, and Zhang Shizi asked ten or more questions, but the officer and his attendants could not answer. A low-ranking official from the Tiger Enclosure came forward and answered the emperor's questions about the animals very accurately. The emperor wanted to see if Zhang Shizi could respond quickly and accurately. Emperor Xiaowen said, "Is this official not good enough? The officer in charge is not reliable!" He then ordered Zhang Shizi to appoint the low-ranking official as the commander of the imperial menagerie. Zhang Shizi had finished his duties and then spoke freely. He said, "Your Majesty, you appointed the two emperors, Entang and Dongyang, as long-lived people. These two people could not speak their minds, so how can this low-ranking official be so eloquent and quick-witted?" The emperor said, "Good." He then stopped appointing the low-ranking official.

The emperor got into his carriage and summoned Zhang Shizi to ride with him. They rode slowly and the emperor asked Zhang Shizi about the weaknesses of Qin. Zhang Shizi spoke freely and told the emperor everything. When they arrived at the palace, the emperor appointed Zhang Shizi as the commander of the imperial carriage.

Later, the crown prince and the king of Liang rode in a carriage to the palace, but did not dismount at the gate. Zhang Shizi then stopped the crown prince and the king of Liang from entering the palace. He then impeached them for not dismounting at the gate. The empress dowager heard about it and Emperor Xiaowen removed his crown and apologized, saying, "I taught my son not to be respectful." The empress dowager then sent a messenger to pardon the crown prince and the king of Liang, and they were allowed to enter the palace. Emperor Xiaowen was impressed with Zhang Shizi and appointed him as a middle-ranking official.

Later, Zhang Shizi was appointed as a middle-ranking official. He accompanied the emperor to the tomb of the first emperor of Han. They were at the north side of the tomb. The emperor pointed to a new road and said, "This is the road to Handan." He ordered the empress dowager to play the zither, and the emperor himself played the zither while singing. He looked sad and melancholic, and then said to the officials, "Alas! Using stone coffins from the north mountains, using silk and wool to wrap the corpse, and painting the coffin, is it possible to move it?" The officials all said, "Good." Zhang Shizi then stepped forward and said, "If there is something to be buried, even if it is in the south mountains, it can still be buried. If there is nothing to be buried, even if there is no stone coffin, what is the point of being sad?" The emperor praised him. Later, the emperor appointed Zhang Shizi as the grand inquisitor.

Later, the emperor went out of the city through the Middle Wei Bridge, and a person ran out from under the bridge, causing the imperial carriage to be startled. The emperor ordered the guards to catch the person and bring him to the grand inquisitor. Zhang Shizi investigated the case and said, "The person is a local resident who heard that the emperor was passing by and hid under the bridge. He thought that the emperor had already passed, so he came out and saw the imperial carriage and the guards, and he ran away." The grand inquisitor of Qin said that the person should be punished with a fine. Emperor Xiaowen was angry and said, "This person startled my horse, and my horse is gentle, so it would not have been injured even if it had been a different horse. But the grand inquisitor punished him with a fine. Is this not unfair?" Zhang Shizi said, "The law is a common law for the emperor and the people. If the law is like this, and we add more punishment, it will not be trusted by the people. Moreover, at the time, the emperor ordered the person to be executed, but now he has been brought to the grand inquisitor, and the grand inquisitor is the standard for the people. If the grand inquisitor punishes lightly, the people will not know what to do. Only Your Majesty can decide." The emperor was silent for a long time and then said, "The grand inquisitor is right."

Later, someone stole a jade ring from the imperial palace and was caught. Emperor Xiaowen was angry and ordered the grand inquisitor to investigate. Zhang Shizi examined the law and said that the person should be executed. Emperor Xiaowen was angry and said, "This person stole from the imperial palace, and you, grand inquisitor, want to execute him, but you are not following the law. This is not what the imperial ancestors wanted." Zhang Shizi removed his hat and bowed his head, saying, "The law is like this, and I am just following it. Moreover, the punishment is different depending on whether the crime is serious or not. If the person stole from the imperial palace, it is like one in a million, and if a commoner digs up a small amount of soil from the tomb of the first emperor, what punishment would Your Majesty give him?" The emperor was silent for a long time and then spoke to the empress dowager about it. The empress dowager agreed with the grand inquisitor. At that time, the middle-ranking official Zhou Yafu and the king of Liang, Wang Cian, saw that Zhang Shizi was fair-minded and became friends with him. Zhang Shizi became famous throughout the country.

Later, Emperor Xiaowen died, and Emperor Jing ascended to the throne. Zhang Shizi was afraid and said he was ill. He wanted to retire, but he was afraid of being punished severely. He wanted to see the emperor, but he did not know what to do. He followed the advice of Wang Sheng and finally saw the emperor. Wang Sheng was a master of the Yellow Emperor's teachings and a scholar. He was summoned to the imperial court and all the high-ranking officials and ministers attended. Wang Sheng said, "I am old and poor, and I will not be of any use to Zhang Shizi." He then asked Zhang Shizi to tie his shoes for him. Zhang Shizi knelt down and tied Wang Sheng's shoes. After that, someone said to Wang Sheng, "Why did you humiliate Zhang Shizi by making him tie your shoes?" Wang Sheng said, "I am old and poor, and I will not be of any use to Zhang Shizi. Zhang Shizi is a famous official, and I just wanted to make him more famous." The officials all praised Wang Sheng and respected Zhang Shizi.

Zhang Shizi served Emperor Jing for a few years and was appointed as the governor of Chu. He was dismissed. Emperor Wu ascended to the throne and sought out talented officials, and he recommended Zhang Shizi. Zhang Shizi was over ninety years old and could not serve as an official again, so he recommended his son, Zhang Zhi, to be a cavalryman. Zhang Zhi was also a talented official and was a friend of mine.

The historian said: Zhang Shizi's words were long and wise, and he did not compromise with the emperor's whims. Feng Gong's words about the general were also wise and had a good flavor. His words were like this: "You don't know a person, but you can see his friends." The two officials' words were worthy of being recited in the palace. The book says, "Not biased, not partisan, the way of the king is clear; not partisan, not biased, the way of the king is easy." Zhang Shizi and Feng Gong were close to this. [end of text]
