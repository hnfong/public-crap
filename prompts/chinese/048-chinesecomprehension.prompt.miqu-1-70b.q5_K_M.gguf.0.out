 This poem appears to be a reflection on history and the passage of time, rather than specifically about Wu SanGui (吳三桂), who was a general and politician during the early Qing dynasty. However, it does mention historical figures and events that could be interpreted as allusions to Wu SanGui's situation.

Here's a breakdown of the poem:

1. 李陵心事久風塵，三十年來詎臥薪？- "Has the heart of Li Ling been troubled by the wind and dust for so long, unable to rest on his firewood for thirty years?" Li Ling was a Han dynasty general who surrendered to the Xiongnu. This line expresses the long-lasting impact of historical events and the feelings of remorse or unrest they may cause.

2. 復楚未能先覆楚，帝秦何必又亡秦。- "The restoration of Chu had not yet occurred before Chu was destroyed, so why did the First Emperor of Qin need to destroy Qin again?" This line refers to the rise and fall of dynasties, possibly alluding to the cyclical nature of history and the futility of trying to hold onto power.

3. 丹心早為紅顏改，青史難寬白髮人。- "The red-hearted one changed his heart early, but the green history is hard on the white-haired man." This line could be interpreted as a commentary on loyalty and betrayal. The "red-hearted one" may refer to someone who was initially loyal to a cause but then switched sides. "Green history" is a metaphor for historical records, which can be unforgiving to those who betray their cause.

4. 永夜角聲應不寐，那堪思子又思親。- "The sound of the horn at night keeps one from sleeping, and then there is the additional thought of one's children and relatives." This line expresses the anxiety and worry that come with being involved in historical events and the impact they can have on one's family.

While this poem does not directly mention Wu SanGui, it could be interpreted as commenting on his situation. Wu SanGui was a Ming dynasty general who surrendered to the Qing and helped them conquer China. The lines about loyalty, betrayal, and the impact of historical events on one's family could be seen as relevant to his story. However, without more context, it is difficult to say for certain that the poem is specifically about him. [end of text]
