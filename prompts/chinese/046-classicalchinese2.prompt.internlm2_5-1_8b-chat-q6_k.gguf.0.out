This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

During a meeting with the king, the king was considering a plan, and everyone else couldn't stop him. After the meeting, he was happy. Wu Zheng, a military leader, approached and said, "I've heard about the king's words from his trusted advisors. Can you tell me what they were?"

The king asked, "What were the king's words?"

Wu Zheng replied, "The king was thinking of a plan, but no one could stop him. After the meeting, he was happy. Then, the king's advisor, Zhen Zhou, asked, 'What was the king's worry?'

The king replied, "I was thinking of a plan, but no one could stop me. That's why I was worried. The advisor said, 'The king was worried because he thought of a plan that no one could stop him. He was worried because he thought of a plan that no one could stop him. He was worried because he thought of a plan that no one could stop him.' Now, because of his lack of strength and wisdom, no one could stop him. That's why he was worried. The king was worried because he was worried. That's why he was happy."

The king bowed and said, "Thank you for reminding me of my mistakes."

(2) The moral of the story is that a king who is thinking of a plan and is worried about its success is likely to be successful. This is because the king is worried about the success of his plan, which is a sign of his confidence in it. The story also highlights the importance of trust and the role of advisors in a leader's decision-making process. Wu Zheng, the advisor, is able to provide valuable insight and advice to the king, which helps the king make a better decision.

(3) The concepts in the story have a counterpart in Western (European) thought. The concept of a king thinking of a plan and being worried about its success is a common theme in Western thought, especially in the context of leadership and strategic planning. The story of Wu Zheng, the advisor, providing valuable advice to the king, is a classic example of how a trusted advisor can help a leader make better decisions. This is a reflection of the idea that a leader should rely on the advice of trusted advisors to make informed decisions. [end of text]
