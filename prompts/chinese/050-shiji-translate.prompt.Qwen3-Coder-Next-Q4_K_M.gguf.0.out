“Biography of Zhang Shi zhi and Feng Tang”

Zhang Shizhi, a native of Duyang, styled Ji, had an elder brother named Zhong with whom he lived. He entered service as a cavalry guard through payment of wealth, serving Emperor Xiaowen, yet after ten years remained unpromoted and unknown. Shizhi said: “Long service has depleted Zhong’s property, and I have made no progress.” He wished to resign and return home. General of the Central Guards Yuan Ang knew his talent and regretted his departure, so he requested that Shizhi be transferred to fill the post of usher. After Shizhi had completed his morning audience, he stepped forward to speak of beneficial matters. The Emperor said: “Keep it down to practical matters; avoid overly lofty theories, so that what you propose may be implemented today.” Thus Shizhi discussed matters between the Qin and Han dynasties—why Qin fell and why Han rose—for some time. The Emperor commended him and appointed Shizhi as Assistant Usher.

Shizhi accompanied the Emperor on a tour, ascending the Tiger Enclosure. The Emperor asked the Superintendent of the Imperial Park regarding the register of birds and beasts, posing over ten questions. The Superintendent looked left and right, unable to answer any. A minor district officer (se fu) standing nearby then stepped forward to answer all the Superintendent’s duties thoroughly, hoping to demonstrate his ability to respond fluently and endlessly. The Emperor said: “Should officials not be like this? The Superintendent is utterly incompetent!” He then ordered Zhang Shizhi to appoint the minor officer as Superintendent of the Imperial Park. Shizhi, after a long pause, said: “Your Majesty, what kind of man do you consider Jianghou Zhou Bo?” The Emperor replied: “A virtuous man.” Shizhi asked again: “How about Dongyanghou Zhang Xianghe?” The Emperor replied again: “A virtuous man.” Shizhi said: “Jianghou and Dongyanghou are called virtuous men; yet these two, when reporting matters, could barely utter their thoughts—how could they imitate this minor officer’s glib, fluent, and clever tongue! Moreover, Qin appointed clerks skilled in legal documents, and officials competed in being hasty, severe, and harshly scrutinizing; yet their flaw was merely formalities, lacking genuine compassion. Consequently, they never heard of their own faults, leading to decline and culminating in the collapse of the Second Qin Emperor’s reign. Now, if Your Majesty promotes this minor officer for his eloquence, I fear the world will follow like wind over grass, competing in eloquence without substance. Moreover, the influence of the superior upon the inferior is swifter than shadow or echo; thus decisions must be made with utmost caution.” The Emperor said: “Well said.” He then stopped and did not appoint the minor officer.

The Emperor boarded his carriage and summoned Shizhi to ride beside him, slowly proceeding while asking him about Qin’s shortcomings. Shizhi gave a straightforward account. Upon reaching the palace, the Emperor appointed Shizhi as Director of the Public Gate.

Soon after, the Crown Prince and Prince Liang entered the palace together in one carriage and failed to dismount at the司马门 (Sima Gate). Shizhi thus pursued and stopped them, forbidding their entry through the palace gate. He then impeached them for disrespect by failing to dismount at the public gate and submitted the case. Empress Bo heard of it, and Emperor Wen removed his crown and apologized, saying: “I failed to discipline my sons properly.” Empress Bo then dispatched an envoy bearing an imperial edict to pardon the Crown Prince and Prince Liang, after which they were allowed to enter. Thus Emperor Wen regarded Shizhi as extraordinary and appointed him as Central Gentleman (Zhongdafu).

Soon after, he was promoted to General of the Central Guards. Accompanying the Emperor on a tour to Ba Ling, they stopped north of a latrine. At that time, the Shenyifu (Lady Shen) accompanied the Emperor, and he pointed to the road to Xinfeng and said: “This is the road to Handan.” He then had Lady Shen play the se, and he leaned against the se and sang himself, his mood deeply sorrowful and melancholy. He turned to his ministers and said: “Ah! If one were to use stones from the Northern Hills as a coffin, pack it with ramie fiber, and lacquer the gaps, could it ever be moved?” Those around all said: “Good.” Shizhi stepped forward and said: “If there were things within the tomb one could desire, even sealing it within the Southern Mountains would still leave an opening; but if there were nothing desired within, then even without a stone coffin, what sorrow could there be?” The Emperor commended him. Thereafter, he appointed Shizhi as Grand Commandant (Tingwei).

Soon after, the Emperor set out from the Central Wei Bridge, when a man emerged from beneath the bridge, startling the Emperor’s carriage horses. The Emperor ordered cavalry to capture him and handed him over to the Grand Commandant. Shizhi investigated and interrogated him. The man said: “I am a county resident. Hearing the imperial procession’s clearance cry (bib), I hid beneath the bridge. After a long time, thinking the procession had passed, I emerged and saw the Emperor’s carriage and cavalry, so I ran away.” The Grand Commandant, according to law, ruled that one who violated the imperial procession’s clearance should be fined gold. The Emperor angrily said: “This man personally startled my horses. My horses happened to be gentle; had it been other horses, would they not surely have injured me? Yet the Grand Commandant rules only a fine!” Shizhi said: “The law is something the Son of Heaven shares with the whole realm. If the law is thus, yet we impose heavier punishment, then the law loses credibility among the people. Moreover, at that moment, had the Emperor ordered immediate execution, it would have ended there. But now that the case has been referred to the Grand Commandant, the Grand Commandant is the arbiter of justice for the realm; if he tilts even slightly, the whole realm’s application of law will become arbitrary—how can the people know how to place their hands and feet? I beg Your Majesty to consider this.” After a long pause, the Emperor said: “The Grand Commandant’s ruling is correct.”

Later, someone stole the jade rings placed before the seat in the Ancestral Temple of Gaozu. The man was captured, and the Emperor, enraged, handed him over to the Grand Commandant for punishment. Shizhi, according to law concerning theft of ritual objects used by the ancestral temple, submitted a report stating the penalty should be public execution. The Emperor became furious and said: “This man is utterly lawless, daring to steal the ancestral temple vessels of the former emperor. I referred the case to the Grand Commandant hoping for execution of his entire clan, yet you submit punishment according to law—this is not how I expect you to honor our ancestral temple!” Shizhi removed his crown, kowtowed, and apologized, saying: “The penalty prescribed by law is sufficient. Moreover, crimes of equal severity differ only in degree of rebellion or obedience. Now, if one steals ritual vessels and his clan is exterminated, then suppose a foolish commoner were to take a handful of soil from Changling—how would Your Majesty increase the penalty?” After a long time, the Emperor discussed the matter with Empress, and finally approved the Grand Commandant’s ruling. At that time, Central Military Governor Marquis of Tiaohou Zhou Yafu and Prime Minister of Liang Marquis of Shandu Wang Tiankai saw that Shizhi’s judgments were fair, and thus formed close friendships with him. Thus Zhang Tingwei was renowned throughout the realm.

After Emperor Wen’s death, Emperor Jing ascended the throne. Shizhi, fearing, feigned illness, wishing to resign and leave, yet feared severe punishment; he wished to appear and apologize, yet did not know how. Following Wang Sheng’s advice, he finally appeared and apologized, yet Emperor Jing did not punish him.

Wang Sheng was a scholar well-versed in Huang-Lao doctrines, a recluse. Once summoned to reside in the palace, all three ministers and nine high officials were assembled standing. Wang Sheng, an elderly man, said: “My sock strap is loose,” and turning to Grand Commandant Zhang, said: “Please tie my sock for me!” Shizhi knelt and tied it. Afterward, someone said to Wang Sheng: “Why on earth did you publicly humiliate Grand Commandant Zhang, making him kneel to tie your sock?” Wang Sheng replied: “I am old and lowly, and I realize I can no longer benefit Grand Commandant Zhang. Since Zhang Tingwei is today a renowned minister of the realm, I deliberately humiliated him, making him kneel to tie my sock, hoping thereby to enhance his prestige.” Upon hearing this, the high officials esteemed Wang Sheng and respected Zhang Tingwei.

Zhang Tingwei served Emperor Jing for over a year, then was appointed Chancellor of Huainan, yet still remained affected by his earlier offenses. Later, Shizhi died. His son was Zhang Zhi, styled Changgong, who rose to the rank of Gentleman (Daifu) but was later dismissed, for he could not curry favor with the world, and thus never held office again.

Feng Tang: His grandfather was from Zhao; his father relocated to Dai. After the Han’s founding, the family was relocated to Anling. Tang was renowned for filial piety and served as Director of the Central Guards’ Office under Emperor Wen. One day, Emperor Wen’s carriage passed by and asked Tang: “Elder, why did you become a guard yourself? Where is your home?” Tang answered truthfully. The Emperor said: “When I resided in Dai, my Superintendent of Food, Gao Qu, often spoke to me of the Zhao general Li Qi’s excellence, fighting at Jule below. Now, every time I eat, my thoughts are always in Jule. Do you know him?” Tang replied: “He is still inferior to Lian Po and Li Mu as generals.” The Emperor asked: “Why so?” Tang said: “My grandfather, when in Zhao, served as a military commander and was close to Li Mu. My father was formerly Chancellor of Dai and was close to Zhao’s general Li Qi, thus knowing his character well.” Upon hearing about Lian Po and Li Mu, the Emperor was greatly pleased and struck his thigh, saying: “Ah! How unfortunate that I cannot have Lian Po or Li Mu as my generals in my time—how could I fear the Xiongnu!” Tang said: “My lord! Even if Your Majesty had Lian Po or Li Mu, he could not employ them.” The Emperor became angry, rose, and entered the inner palace. After a long while, he summoned Tang and reproached him: “How could you publicly humiliate me—was there no private place?” Tang apologized: “I, a rustic, do not know about taboos.”

At that time, the Xiongnu had just launched a major invasion of Chu Na, killing the Governor of Beidi, Ang. The Emperor, concerned about the Hu raiders, finally asked Tang again: “How do you know I cannot employ Lian Po or Li Mu?” Tang replied: “I have heard that in ancient times, when kings dispatched generals, they knelt and pushed the axle of the chariot, saying: ‘Within the palace gates, I decide; beyond the palace gates, the general decides.’ Military merit, ranks, rewards, and punishments were all decided in the field, and only upon returning was a report submitted. This was no empty statement. My grandfather said: When Li Mu served as Zhao’s general guarding the frontier, he used all military market taxes to reward his soldiers, decided rewards independently without interference from the court, and was entrusted with responsibility to achieve success. Thus Li Mu could fully utilize his wisdom and talent, deploying 1,300 chariots, 13,000 cavalry archers, and 100,000 elite warriors, driving the Chanyu northward, defeating the Donghu, destroying the Danlin, suppressing the powerful Qin in the west, and resisting Han and Wei in the south. At that time, Zhao nearly became hegemon. Later, when King Qian of Zhao ascended the throne, his mother was a courtesan. Upon King Qian’s accession, he listened to Guo Kai’s slander and ultimately executed Li Mu, appointing Yan Ju to replace him. Thus the army was defeated, soldiers fled, and Zhao was captured and destroyed by Qin. Now I privately hear that Wei Shang serves as Governor of Yuntong, using all military market taxes to reward his soldiers, supplementing with his own salary, slaughtering an ox every five days to feast guests, officers, and retainers, so the Xiongnu avoided the area and stayed far from Yuntong’s frontier posts. Once, when the barbarians invaded, Wei Shang led chariots and cavalry to attack them, killing many. The soldiers are all sons of common families, rising from the fields to join the army—how can they know the minute regulations and roster codes? After fighting hard all day, killing enemies and capturing prisoners, submitting reports to headquarters, if a single detail does not match, civil officials punish them according to law. Rewards are not granted, yet officials strictly enforce the law. I, in my foolishness, believe Your Majesty’s laws are too strict, rewards too light, and punishments too severe. Moreover, Governor Wei Shang of Yuntong was merely charged with underreporting enemy heads by six, and Your Majesty handed him over to officials, stripped his rank, and punished him with penal labor. From this, if Your Majesty had Lian Po or Li Mu, he still could not employ them. I am truly foolish, offending taboos—I am guilty of death, guilty of death!” Emperor Wen was pleased. That very day, he ordered Feng Tang to carry the imperial seal and pardon Wei Shang, reinstating him as Governor of Yuntong, and appointed Tang as General of Chariots and Cavalry, in charge of the Central Military Governor and the cavalry of commanderies and states.

In the seventh year, Emperor Jing ascended the throne, appointing Tang as Chancellor of Chu, but later dismissed him. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne, he sought virtuous and talented men and recommended Feng Tang. Tang was then over ninety years old and could no longer serve as an official, so he appointed Tang’s son Feng Sui as a Gentleman. Sui, styled Wangsun, was also an extraordinary man and was on good terms with me.

Grand Historian says: Zhang Ji’s words concerning virtuous men, his adherence to law without yielding to personal bias; Feng Gong’s discussions concerning generals—how flavorful they are! How flavorful they are! As the saying goes: “To know a man, look at his friends.” The praises these two men extolled may be inscribed in the ancestral temple. The Book says: “Neither partial nor partisan, the Way of the King is vast and open; neither partisan nor partial, the Way of the King is smooth and even.” Zhang Ji and Feng Gong came close to this ideal.
