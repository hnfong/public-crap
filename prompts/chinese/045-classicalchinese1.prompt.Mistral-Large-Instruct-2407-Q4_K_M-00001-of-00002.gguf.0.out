 **Q1: Short Summary**
The story tells of West Gate Ximen, who, upon becoming the magistrate of Ye, discovered a local custom where young girls were sacrificed to the River God.

**Q2: Victims**
Young girls from poor families were usually the victims.

**Q3: Beneficiaries**
The old practice benefited the shamans, elders, and local officials who collected money and shared it among themselves.

**Q4: Wits or Force**
The protagonist used wits. He tricked the shamans and elders into the river, feigning that he was following the custom, but ultimately used their own superstition against them.

**Q5: Morality**
- **From the perspective of the victims and their families:** It was moral, as it put an end to the cruel practice and saved lives.
- **From the perspective of the shamans and elders:** It was immoral, as it involved deception and resulted in their deaths.
- **From a utilitarian perspective:** It was moral, as it achieved the greatest good for the greatest number by ending the sacrifices and improving the lives of the people.
