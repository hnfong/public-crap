### Q1: Summary of the Story (5 points)  
During the reign of King Wen of Wei,西门豹 (Ximen Bao) was appointed magistrate of Ye. He discovered that local officials and shamans were exploiting the superstition of "marrying a girl to the river god Hebo" to extort money from villagers, causing poverty and flight. Ximen Bao disrupted the ritual by pretending to find the chosen bride "unworthy" and ordered the shamans and officials to be thrown into the river to "report to Hebo." This ended the cruel practice. He then initiated irrigation projects to benefit agriculture, despite initial resistance, and his reforms brought lasting prosperity to Ye.

### Q2: Victims of the Practice (2 points)  
Young girls from poor families ("小家女好者") were targeted as victims. They were forcibly selected, dressed elaborately, and drowned in the river as "brides" for Hebo.

### Q3: Beneficiaries of the Old Practice (2 points)  
The local officials (三老, 廷掾) and shamans (祝巫) benefited financially. They collected millions in coins, using only a fraction for the ritual and keeping the rest for themselves.

### Q4: Use of Wits or Force? (5 points)  
Ximen Bao used **wits**, not brute force. He did not openly condemn the practice but instead **subverted it through irony and performative justice**. By pretending to comply with the ritual logic—e.g., demanding "better brides" and sending shamans/officials to "report to Hebo"—he exposed its absurdity without violating social norms. His theatrical approach caused the perpetrators to confess through fear, not coercion.

### Q5: Morality from Various Perspectives (10 points)  
- **Utilitarian**: Moral, as he ended a harmful practice and brought long-term benefits (irrigation, safety).  
- **Deontological**: Questionable, as he deceived and executed individuals without trial. However, he operated within his legal authority as magistrate.  
- **Contemporary Legal Perspective**: Unethical by modern standards (extrajud killings), but acceptable in ancient contexts where magistrates had broad discretion.  
- **Local Perspective**: Initially seen as harsh, but ultimately justified by results—saving lives and promoting prosperity.  
- **Confucian Perspective**: Praiseworthy for protecting the people and upholding benevolent governance (仁政), though the method was unconventional.

### Q6: Analysis of the Final Comment (15 points)  
The comment contrasts three styles of governance:  
- 子产 (Zichan): "People **cannot deceive** him" (strict laws, oversight).  
- 子贱 (Zijian): "People **cannot bear to deceive** him" (virtuous leadership, empathy).  
- 西门豹 (Ximen Bao): "People **dare not deceive** him" (awe through severity).  

The question "谁最贤?" (Who is most virtuous?) implies a hierarchy, with "cannot bear to deceive" (moral influence) often seen as superior to "dare not deceive" (fear).  

**Fairness**: The comment is **fair but context-specific**. Ximen Bao’s methods were effective for Ye’s deeply entrenched corruption and superstition. His severity was necessary to break a harmful cycle, and his subsequent irrigation projects showed compassion. However, his approach relied on deterrence rather than moral transformation, making it less "virtuous" in Confucian terms but pragmatically justified. The comparison highlights that optimal governance depends on circumstances. [end of text]
