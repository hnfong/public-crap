**Q1: Give a short summary of the story (5 points)**  
The story of Ximen Bao, a magistrate in the state of Wei, who exposes and ends the corrupt practice of sacrificing young women to the river god (Heshe) by cleverly using the ritual to punish the perpetrators. He then improves the region by building irrigation systems, earning lasting respect.

**Q2: What kind of women were usually the victims in the story (2 points)**  
The victims were usually young, unmarried women from poor families.

**Q3: Who were deemed to benefit from the old practice of offering girls? (2 points)**  
The local officials (San Lao and廷掾), the priest (巫祝), and the wealthy (豪长者) benefited by extorting money from the people and keeping the surplus after spending a small portion on the ritual.

**Q4: Did the protagonist use wits or force to deal with the situation? Explain (5 points)**  
Ximen Bao used wits. He pretended to believe in the ritual and participated in the ceremony, but instead of sacrificing the girl, he accused the priest of not properly communicating with the river god and had her and her assistants thrown into the river. This clever act exposed the fraud and ended the practice.

**Q5: Was it moral for the protagonist to do so? Briefly provide views from various perspectives (10 points)**  
- **Moral Perspective**: Yes, it was moral. Ximen Bao exposed a corrupt practice that exploited innocent lives and wealth, and his actions ultimately improved the lives of the people.
- **Legal Perspective**: His actions could be seen as unconventional, but since the practice was illegal and exploitative, his intervention was justified.
- **Social Perspective**: His actions restored justice and trust in the community, benefiting society as a whole.
- **Religious Perspective**: While he used the ritual to expose the fraud, his actions ultimately challenged superstition and promoted rational governance.

**Q6: At the end of 滑稽列传, it is said that: "傳曰：「子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。」三子之才能誰最賢哉？辨治者當能別之。" -- explain what it means, and whether the comment is fair. (15 points)**  
The quote compares three officials: Zichan, Zijian, and Ximen Bao. It suggests that Zichan's governance was so transparent that people couldn't deceive him, Zijian's kindness made people unwilling to deceive him, and Ximen Bao's strictness made people afraid to deceive him. The comment is fair because it highlights the unique strengths of each official's approach to governance. Ximen Bao's use of wit and authority to end corruption and improve the region demonstrates his exceptional ability, making him equally deserving of praise alongside the others. [end of text]
