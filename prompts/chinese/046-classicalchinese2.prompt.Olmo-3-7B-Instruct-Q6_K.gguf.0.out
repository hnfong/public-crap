### (1) Translation of the Story into English (with Chinese Proper Names)

**Original Passage (relevant excerpt):**

> 魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。  
> 吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」  
> 武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」  
> 吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：『諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。』今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，國幾於亡乎！』」  
> 楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。  
> 武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

**English Translation:**

> Emperor Wu of Wei was plotting a coup when the time was right, but the ministers could not catch him in the act. After he abdicated and took his leave, he appeared to be happy. Wu Zhi (the official) approached and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Cheng of Chu spoken to someone?"  
> Wu of Wei replied, "What were the words of King Cheng of Chu?"  
> Wu Zhi explained: "King Cheng of Chu was plotting a coup at the right moment, but the ministers could not apprehend him. After he abdicated, he was troubled in spirit. A minister named Feng Zhi asked him why he was troubled. The king said, 'I did not scheme while in power; the ministers could not catch me. That is why I am troubled. It is the saying within the secret records: "The kings who seek to become rulers by forming their own alliances are strong in friends, cautious with doubts, but if they plot while lacking self-awareness, their state will perish." Now, because I did not scheme with wisdom and the ministers could not catch me, our country is nearly lost! That is why I am troubled.' King Cheng of Chu was troubled, but the emperor was happy."  
> Wu of Wei, upon revisiting the matter, kowtowed and said, "May Heaven reward the sage Xunzi for correcting the faults of the people."

### (2) Explanation of the Moral of the Story

The story illustrates the dangers of **deceit, arrogance, and lack of self-awareness in leadership**. 

- **Emperor Wu of Wei** committed a coup while seemingly acting with authority, but he was actually scheming behind the scenes. His ministers failed to detect his treachery because he did not act with integrity or transparency.
- When exposed (by Wu Zhi's questioning), Wu of Wei's lack of humility and self-reflection became clear. He was untroubled by his actions (appearing happy), but the king he overthrew was troubled because he acted without wisdom and self-awareness.
- The moral is that **true leaders must act with virtue, humility, and wisdom. Deceptive or self-centered rulers may achieve short-term gains but will ultimately bring about their own downfall and the suffering of their people**. It also emphasizes the importance of **honesty and accountability**, as well as the value of learning from the mistakes of predecessors.

### (3) Western (European) Counterpart Concepts

Yes, the concepts in this passage resonate with several themes in Western (especially European and Christian) thought, though the specific cultural context is different.

#### Similar Concepts in Western Thought:

1. **Moral Responsibility and Accountability (Christian Ethics):**
   - In Christian and Western moral philosophy, leaders (kings, popes, etc.) are expected to act justly and transparently. Deceit and ambition without humility are often condemned (e.g., in the parables of Jesus or in the teachings of Thomas Aquinas on virtue and rulership).
   - The idea that a ruler who is untroubled by wrongdoing while others are troubled reflects the Christian emphasis on conscience and guilt for sin (see Romans 15:2, "For he saith, I will not be sorry for the dead, but for the living also.")

2. **Hubris and its Consequences (Greek Philosophy):**
   - The concept of **hubris** (excessive pride or arrogance) is central in Greek philosophy (especially in the works of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Plato). Hubris leads to downfall, as seen in the myth of Icarus or in the Oresteia.
   - Xunzi's warning about lacking self-awareness and plotting without wisdom parallels the Greek idea that a leader's lack of humility and moral discernment is a form of hubris.

3. **Virtue Ethics and Character in Leadership (Aristotle):**
   - Aristotle's concept of **eudaimonia** (flourishing through virtue) and his discussion of **phronesis** (practical wisdom) stress that effective and ethical leadership requires wisdom, self-knowledge, and moral virtue.
   - A ruler who is self-centered or deceitful, as in the passage, would lack the practical wisdom Aristotle considers essential for good governance.

4. **Divine Right and Moral Governance (Medieval Europe):**
   - The idea that a ruler's legitimacy comes from virtue or divine favor (not just birth or power) is echoed here. A ruler who gains power through deceit may lose divine or moral support, leading to instability (as in Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan, where a tyrant loses popular support).

#### In Summary:
While Xunzi's passage is rooted in Confucian and Chinese political philosophy, the themes of **moral accountability, humility, the dangers of hubris, and the necessity of virtue in leadership** are universal and have clear counterparts in Western thought. The warning against deceptive rulers and the emphasis on self-reflection in leadership are timeless concerns found in many cultures' moral and philosophical traditions.
