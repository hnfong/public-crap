"The Biographies of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang"

Zhang Tingwei Shizhi was a man of Duyang, his courtesy name was Ji. He had an elder brother, Zhong, with whom he lived together. He became a cavalry attendant by means of wealth and served Emperor Xiaowen, but for ten years he was not transferred and gained no fame. Shizhi said, "A long service as an official diminishes my brother Zhong's property, and it is not successful." He wished to resign and return home. The General of the Palace Attendants Yuan Ang, knowing his worth and regretting his departure, then requested to transfer Shizhi to fill the position of a court usher. After Shizhi had finished attending court, he accordingly came forward to speak of matters that were beneficial and appropriate. Emperor Wen said, "Lower it; do not make it too lofty a discussion, so that it can be implemented now." Thereupon, Shizhi spoke about matters between Qin and Han, why Qin was lost and Han was risen, for a long time. Emperor Wen praised it and then appointed Shizhi as the Chief of Court Ushers.

Shizhi followed on an excursion, ascending the tiger enclosure. The Emperor asked the Shanglin尉 about the registers of the various birds and beasts; over ten questions were asked, the尉 looked left and right, and could not answer any of them. The tiger enclosure sefu, from the side, answered on behalf of the尉 the Emperor's questions about the bird and beast registers in great detail, wishing to display his ability to respond orally without end. Emperor Wen said, "Should an official not be like this? The尉 is worthless!" Then he ordered Shizhi to appoint the sefu as the Shanglin令. Shizhi, after a long time, came forward and said, "What does Your Majesty think of people like Jianghou Zhou Bo?" The Emperor said, "He is a dignified elder." He asked again, "What about Dongyanghou Zhang Xiangru?" The Emperor again said, "A dignified elder." Shizhi said, "Jianghou and Dongyanghou are called dignified elders; these two men, when speaking of matters, could hardly get words out of their mouths—how could they emulate this sefu's glib tongue and quick responses! Moreover, Qin, by employing officials of the knife and brush, had officials competing to surpass each other in haste and harsh scrutiny, but the flaw was only empty formality, without the substance of compassion. Therefore, they did not hear of their faults, and by the time of the second generation, the world collapsed. Now, if Your Majesty promotes this sefu superbly because of his eloquence, I fear the world will follow the wind and compete in eloquence without substance. Moreover, the transformation from below follows above swifter than shadow and echo; actions and measures cannot be undertaken without caution." Emperor Wen said, "Good." Then he stopped and did not appoint the sefu.

The Emperor mounted his carriage, summoned Shizhi to accompany him in the carriage, proceeded slowly, and asked Shizhi about the failings of Qin. [Shizhi] fully answered with straightforward words. Upon reaching the palace, the Emperor appointed Shizhi as the Gongche令.

Soon after, the Crown Prince and the King of Liang entered court together in one carriage, and did not dismount at the Sima Gate. Thereupon, Shizhi chased and stopped the Crown Prince and the King of Liang, not allowing them to enter the palace gate. Then he impeached them for not dismounting at the public gate, which was disrespectful, and submitted a memorial. When Empress Dowager Bo heard of it, Emperor Wen took off his cap and apologized, saying, "I have not been careful in teaching my sons." Empress Dowager Bo then sent an envoy to convey an edict pardoning the Crown Prince and the King of Liang, after which they were able to enter. Emperor Wen, because of this, regarded Shizhi as extraordinary and appointed him as a Grand Master.

Soon after, he reached the position of General of the Palace Attendants. He followed on an excursion to Baling, residing to the north facing the side chamber. At that time, Lady Shen was accompanying them. The Emperor pointed out the road to Xinfeng to Lady Shen, saying, "This is the road that goes to Handan." He had Lady Shen play the se, and the Emperor himself leaned against the se and sang, his mood sorrowful and melancholic. He turned to the ministers and said, "Alas! If the outer coffin were made of stone from the northern mountains, with hemp and silk cut and laid, lacquered in between, could it be moved?" Those on the left and right all said, "Good." Shizhi came forward and said, "If there is something desirable inside, even if sealed with Southern Mountain, there would still be a gap; if there is nothing desirable inside, even without a stone outer coffin, what worry is there then!" Emperor Wen praised it. Afterwards, he appointed Shizhi as the Commandant of Justice.

Soon after, the Emperor was traveling out and crossed the Zhongwei Bridge. A man came out from under the bridge, and the imperial carriage horses were startled. Thereupon, he sent cavalry to arrest him and handed him over to the Commandant of Justice. Shizhi conducted the interrogation. [The man] said, "I am a man from the county. I heard the clearing of the road and hid under the bridge. After a long time, I thought the procession had already passed, so I came out, saw the imperial carriage and riders, and then ran." The Commandant of Justice memorialized the judgment: one person who violated the clearing of the road should be fined. Emperor Wen was angry and said, "This man personally startled my horse; my horse, fortunately, is gentle. If it were another horse, would it not have certainly thrown and injured me? Yet the Commandant of Justice only fines him!" Shizhi said, "The law is what the Son of Heaven shares with all under heaven. Now the law is thus, and if it is made more severe, then the law will not be trusted by the people. Moreover, at that moment, if the Emperor had sent someone to immediately execute him, it would have been over. Now it has been handed down to the Commandant of Justice. The Commandant of Justice is the balance of all under heaven; if it tilts once, then the application of law everywhere will become light or heavy, and where would the people place their hands and feet? I only ask Your Majesty to consider this." After a long time, the Emperor said, "The Commandant of Justice's judgment is correct."

Afterwards, someone stole a jade ring from in front of the seat in the Gaomiao temple. He was captured, and Emperor Wen was angry and handed him over to the Commandant of Justice for judgment. Shizhi, according to the law that those who steal articles from the imperial ancestral temple should be memorialized, memorialized that the judgment should be execution in the marketplace. The Emperor was greatly angry and said, "The man is without morality, to actually steal vessels from the temple of the previous emperor. The reason I handed him over to the Commandant of Justice was to have him exterminated along with his family, yet you, according to the law, memorialize this—this is not how I intend to serve the ancestral temple." Shizhi took off his cap, knocked his head, and apologized, saying, "The law is sufficient thus. Moreover, crimes are equal, yet they differ according to the degree of defiance and compliance. Now, if you exterminate the family of one who stole a vessel from the ancestral temple, what if, by one chance in ten thousand, an ignorant commoner took a handful of soil from the Changling tomb—how would Your Majesty add to the law then?" After a long time, Emperor Wen discussed it with the Empress Dowager, and then approved the Commandant of Justice's judgment. At that time, the Commandant of the Central Guards Tiaohou Zhou Yafu and the Chancellor of Liang Shanduhou Wang Tiankai saw that Shizhi maintained fair judgments, and so they became close friends. Commandant of Justice Zhang was because of this praised throughout the world.

Later, Emperor Wen passed away, and Emperor Jing ascended the throne. Shizhi was afraid and claimed illness. He wished to resign and leave, fearing that great punishment would come; if he wished to see [the Emperor] and apologize, he did not know what would happen. Using Wang Sheng's plan, he finally went to see and apologize, and Emperor Jing did not fault him.

Wang Sheng was skilled in the teachings of Huang-Lao and was a retired scholar. He was once summoned to reside at the court, and all the three lords and nine ministers were gathered standing. Wang Sheng was an old man and said, "My stocking is untied," and turning to Commandant of Justice Zhang, said, "Tie my stocking for me!" Shizhi knelt and tied it. After it was done, some people said to Wang Sheng, "Why did you alone disgrace Commandant of Justice Zhang in court, making him kneel to tie your stocking?" Wang Sheng said, "I am old and lowly, and I consider that in the end I can be of no benefit to Commandant of Justice Zhang. Commandant of Justice Zhang is now a famous minister of the world; I therefore purposely disgraced the Commandant of Justice, making him kneel to tie my stocking, wishing to thereby add to his importance." The gentlemen, hearing this, considered Wang Sheng worthy and esteemed Commandant of Justice Zhang.

Commandant of Justice Zhang served Emperor Jing for over a year, became the Chancellor of the King of Huainan, still because of the previous offense. After a long time, Shizhi passed away. His son was named Zhang Zhi, courtesy name Changgong, who reached the office of Grand Master and was dismissed. Because he could not ingratiate himself with the world, he never held office again for the rest of his life.

Feng Tang: his grandfather was from Zhao. His father moved to Dai. When Han rose, he moved to Anling. Tang was noted for filial piety and became the Chief of the Lang Officials' Office, serving Emperor Wen. Emperor Wen passed by in his carriage and asked Tang, "Why are you, an old man, serving as a lang? Where is your home?" Tang fully answered with the truth. Emperor Wen said, "When I was in Dai, my Superintendent of the Imperial Kitchen Gao Qu often spoke to me of the worth of Zhao's general Li Qi, who fought at the foot of Julu. Now, every time I eat, my thoughts are always at Julu. Do you know about it?" Tang replied, "He is still not as good as Lian Po and Li Mu as generals." The Emperor said, "Why?" Tang said, "My grandfather, when in Zhao, was an officer commanding troops and was friendly with Li Mu. My father was formerly the Chancellor of Dai and was friendly with Zhao's general Li Qi, and knew his character." The Emperor, having heard about the characters of Lian Po and Li Mu, was very pleased and slapped his thigh, saying, "Alas! If only I could have Lian Po and Li Mu as my generals now, would I worry about the Xiongnu!" Tang said, "I beg your pardon! Even if Your Majesty had Lian Po and Li Mu, you could not use them." The Emperor was angry, rose, and entered the forbidden chambers. After a long time, he summoned Tang and reproached him, saying, "Why did you disgrace me before everyone? Was there no private place?" Tang apologized, saying, "This humble person did not know taboos."

At that time, the Xiongnu had newly greatly invaded Chaona, killing the Commandant of Beidi, Ang. The Emperor was concerned about the Hu invaders, and finally asked Tang again, "How do you know that I could not use Lian Po and Li Mu?" Tang replied, "I have heard that when the kings of high antiquity sent out generals, they knelt and pushed the chariot wheels, saying, 'Within the threshold, I decide; outside the threshold, the general decides.' Military merits, ranks, and rewards were all decided outside, and upon return, they were reported. This is not empty words. My grandfather said that when Li Mu was Zhao's general stationed at the border, the taxes from the army markets were all used by himself to feast the soldiers; rewards and gifts were decided outside, without interference from the center. He was entrusted with responsibility and required to achieve success; therefore, Li Mu was able to exhaust his wisdom and ability, dispatched and selected 1,300 chariots, 13,000 skilled cavalry, 100,000 soldiers worth a hundred gold, and thus northward pursued the Chanyu, defeated the Donghu, destroyed Danlin, westward suppressed strong Qin, and southward supported Han and Wei. At that time, Zhao nearly became hegemon. Afterwards, when King Qian of Zhao ascended the throne, his mother was a courtesan. When King Qian was established, he employed Guo Kai's slander and finally executed Li Mu, making Yan Ju replace him. Therefore, the army was defeated, the soldiers fled, and they were captured and destroyed by Qin. Now I have privately heard that Wei Shang is the Governor of Yunzhong; the taxes from his army markets are all used to feast the soldiers and officers; he spends his private funds, every five days butchers an ox, to feast guests, army officers, and retainers. Therefore, the Xiongnu keep far away and do not approach the Yunzhong frontier. The enemy once invaded, and Shang led chariots and cavalry to attack them, killing many of them. The soldiers are all sons of common families, coming from the fields to join the army; how would they know about records and tallies? They fight strenuously all day, beheading and capturing enemies, reporting merits to the headquarters. If one word does not match, the clerks of documents use the law to restrain them. Their rewards are not implemented, but the officials' enforcement of the law is certainly applied. I am foolish and think that Your Majesty's law is too clear, rewards too light, and punishments too heavy. Moreover, the Governor of Yunzhong Wei Shang was convicted because the number of heads and captives reported for merit was short by six. Your Majesty handed him over to the officials, stripped him of his rank, and sentenced him to penal servitude. From this, it can be said that even if Your Majesty had Lian Po and Li Mu, you could not use them. I am truly foolish, having touched upon taboos; I deserve death, I deserve death!" Emperor Wen was pleased. That day, he ordered Feng Tang to hold the tally and pardon Wei Shang, reinstating him as the Governor of Yunzhong, and appointed Tang as the Commandant of Chariots and Cavalry, in charge of the chariot warriors of the Central Commandant and the commandoeries and kingdoms.

In the seventh year, Emperor Jing ascended the throne, appointed Tang as the Chancellor of Chu, and then dismissed him. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne, he sought worthy and good men, and recommended Feng Tang. Tang was then over ninety years old and could no longer serve as an official, so he made Tang's son Feng Sui a lang. Sui's courtesy name was Wangsun; he was also an extraordinary gentleman and was friendly with me.

The Grand Historian says: Zhang Ji's words about dignified elders, upholding the law without迎合ing intentions; Feng Gong's discussion about generals—how flavorful! How flavorful! The saying goes, "If you do not know the man, look at his friends." What these two gentlemen praised and extolled can be recorded in the court temples. The Document says, "Without partiality, without faction, the kingly way is vast; without faction, without partiality, the kingly way is level." Zhang Ji and Feng Gong are close to this.
