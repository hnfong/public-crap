Q1: The story describes how Sima Nao, the magistrate of Ye, exposed and stopped the corrupt practice of sacrificing young women to the River God, using clever tactics to punish the witch and officials, and later improved the people's livelihood by building irrigation canals.

Q2: Poor families' daughters, especially those considered beautiful.

Q3: The local officials (three elders, county magistrate, etc.) and witch doctors who profited from the extortion and division of funds.

Q4: He used both wits and force. He cleverly feigned participation in the ritual to expose the fraud, then used force by throwing the witch and officials into the river to deter them.

Q5: Morality is debatable. From a utilitarian perspective, his actions saved many lives and benefited the people long-term, justifying the means. From a deontological view, deliberately endangering others (even criminals) is immoral. From a legal perspective, he exceeded his authority. From a Confucian view, his ultimate goal of benefiting the people may be seen as virtuous, though his methods were harsh.

Q6: The quote means: Zheng's Zi Chan governed through fairness (people couldn't cheat him), Zichuan governed through benevolence (people wouldn't cheat him), and Sima Nao governed through authority (people dared not cheat him). It compares their governance styles. The comment is fair as it highlights different effective approaches to governance—justice, virtue, and strictness—each suited to different circumstances.
