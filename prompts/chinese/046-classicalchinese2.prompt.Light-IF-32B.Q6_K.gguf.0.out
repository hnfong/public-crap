### **(1) Translation of the Story into English**  
*(Proper names are kept in Chinese as per your request.)*

> Wei Wu Hou made a decision that was appropriate, and none of his ministers could match him. After the court session, he wore a look of joy. Wu Qi stepped forward and said: “Have you ever heard the words of King Chu Zhuang Wang from those around you?”  
> Wu Hou asked: “What did King Chu Zhuang Wang say?”  
> Wu Qi replied: “When King Chu Zhuang Wang made a decision that was appropriate, and none of his ministers could match him, he returned from court with a look of worry. Shen Gong Wu Chen stepped forward and asked: ‘Your Majesty returns from court with a worried face—why is that?’  
> King Chu Zhuang Wang said: ‘I made a decision that was appropriate, and none of my ministers could match me, so I am worried. There is a saying in the middle of the world: “A ruler who gets a good teacher will become king, one who gets a good friend will become a hegemon, one who gets a good advisor will survive, but one who makes plans alone and finds no one to surpass him will perish.”  
> Now, with my lack of virtue, and none of my ministers being able to match me, my country is close to perishing! That is why I am worried.’”  
> Wu Qi continued: “King Chu Zhuang Wang was worried, but you are joyful.”  
> Wu Hou hesitated, bowed twice, and said: “The gods have sent you to correct my mistake.”

### **(2) Moral of the Story**  

The moral of the story is:  
**A wise ruler should be humble and aware of the dangers of overconfidence.**  

When a ruler makes good decisions but finds no one to challenge or match him, it is a sign that the court lacks capable advisors or that the ruler is not encouraging diverse opinions. This can lead to stagnation, poor governance, and ultimately, the decline of the state.  

King Chu Zhuang Wang’s worry shows his self-awareness and concern for the future of his country, while Wei Wu Hou’s initial joy reveals a lack of such awareness. Wu Qi’s reminder helps Wu Hou recognize his mistake and grow as a ruler.

### **(3) Counterparts in Western (European) Thought**  

Yes, the concepts in this story have clear counterparts in Western thought, particularly in classical political philosophy and leadership theory. Here are some key parallels:

#### **A. Humility and Self-Awareness in Leadership**  
- **Aristotle** (in *Nicomachean Ethics* and *Politics*) emphasizes that a good leader must be self-aware and open to advice. He distinguishes between *tyranny* (rule by one who sees himself as superior to all) and *kingship* (rule by one who rules for the good of the people and is open to wisdom).  
- **Plato** (in *The Republic*) talks about the “philosopher-king,” who rules not for personal glory but for the good of the state, and who is humble enough to seek wisdom.

#### **B. The Danger of Overconfidence**  
- **Niccolò Machiavelli** (in *The Prince*) warns that a ruler who is too confident or surrounded by yes-men will be blind to threats and likely to fail. He emphasizes the importance of having honest advisors.  
- **Sun Tzu** (though Chinese, his ideas were influential in both East and West) also warns about overconfidence in *The Art of War*—a ruler who thinks he is always right is likely to make fatal mistakes.

#### **C. The Role of Advisors**  
- The idea that a ruler needs “teachers,” “friends,” or “advisors” to avoid failure is similar to the Western concept of the **“council of wise men”** or **“checks and balances”** in governance.  
- In medieval Europe, kings were often advised by councils of nobles, clergy, or scholars to prevent tyranny and ensure good governance.

#### **D. The Saying: “He who is always right is often wrong”**  
- This is a common saying in Western philosophy and politics, emphasizing that if no one challenges a ruler, he may be making mistakes without realizing it.  
- It echoes the idea in the story: *“One who makes plans alone and finds no one to surpass him will perish.”*
