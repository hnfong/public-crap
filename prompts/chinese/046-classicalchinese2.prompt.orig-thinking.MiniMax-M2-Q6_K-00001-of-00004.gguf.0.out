### 1) English translation

When 魏武侯 was deliberating on affairs and made a decision that was right, none of his ministers could match him. After the court session, he showed a pleased expression. 吳起 stepped forward and said: “Have you ever heard the words of 楚莊王 from those around you?” 魏武侯 asked: “What did 楚莊王 say?” 吳起 replied: “When 楚莊王 deliberated on affairs and made a decision that was right, none of his ministers could match him. After the court session, he showed a worried expression. 申公巫臣 approached and asked: ‘Your Majesty, why do you look worried after the court session?’ 莊王 said: ‘I deliberated on affairs and made a decision that was right, and none of my ministers could match me—that is why I am worried. As the saying among the ministers goes: “A ruler who gains a teacher becomes a king; a ruler who gains a friend becomes a hegemon; a ruler who gains a critic survives; a ruler who relies only on himself and has no one better than himself perishes.” Now, with my unworthiness, none of my ministers can match me—does that not mean my state is near ruin? That is why I am worried.’ 楚莊王 was worried, yet you are pleased.” 魏武侯 hesitated, bowed twice, and said: “Heaven has sent you, Master, to correct my faults.”

### 2) Moral of the story

The story warns rulers against complacency and self-satisfaction. When a ruler’s decisions are unopposed and no one can match him, it is a sign that he lacks worthy advisors and honest criticism. The moral is that a wise ruler should be wary of being surrounded by yes-men and should cultivate teachers, friends, and critics who can challenge and improve his judgment. Pride and isolation lead to decline; humility and counsel preserve the state.

### 3) Western counterparts

Yes. The same ideas appear in Western thought:

- Socratic humility: Socrates emphasized that wisdom begins with recognizing one’s ignorance and seeking counsel rather than relying on one’s own judgment alone.
- Classical warnings against hubris: Greek tragedy and philosophy (e.g., Aristotle) warn that excessive pride and isolation from honest feedback lead to downfall.
- Political counsel: Machiavelli and later thinkers stress the importance of hearing dissenting voices and avoiding flatterers; rulers who surround themselves with sycophants are vulnerable.
- Biblical and proverbial wisdom: Proverbs such as “Pride goes before destruction” and “Where there is no counsel, the people fall” echo the same theme.

In short, the story’s core idea—that a ruler should fear being unopposed and should welcome teachers, friends, and critics—has clear parallels in Western traditions. [end of text]
