Okay, let's break down this fascinating passage from *滑稽列传* and answer your questions.

**Q1: Give a short summary of the story (5 points)**

The story recounts how the people of Ye were impoverished due to a corrupt practice where local elders and shamans (巫) would force young women to be sacrificed as brides for the River God (河伯).  When 西门豹 became magistrate, he publicly exposed and punished the elders, shamans, and their assistants by throwing them into the river. This ended the practice, and he then implemented a system of irrigation canals, bringing prosperity to the region. The canals remained untouched for centuries, revered as a testament to his wise governance.

**Q2: What kind of women were usually the victims in the story (2 points)**

Young, unmarried women were the victims. Specifically, the shamans would select "good-looking" young women to be offered to the River God.

**Q3. Who were deemed to benefit from the old practice of offering girls? (2 points)**

The elders (三老), shamans (巫), and their assistants (巫弟子) benefited financially. They extorted money from the people and divided the proceeds.

**Q4: Did the protagonist use wits or force to deal with the situation? Explain (5 points)**

西门豹 primarily used a combination of both, but force was the dominant element. Initially, he feigned acceptance of the practice, requesting to witness the selection of the bride. Then, he publicly condemned the chosen woman as "unsuitable" and threw the shamans and elders into the river. While there's a theatrical element (asking for the River God's bride, pretending to wait), the ultimate resolution was achieved through brutal, direct action. His "wits" lay in understanding the power dynamics and using the existing ritual against those perpetuating it.

**Q5: Was it moral for the protagonist to do so? Briefly provide views from various perspectives (10 points)**

This is a complex moral question.

*   **西门豹's perspective:** He likely justified his actions as necessary to end a deeply exploitative and harmful practice that impoverished the people. He prioritized the long-term welfare of the community.
*   **The people's perspective:** Initially terrified, they ultimately benefited from his actions and likely viewed him as a savior.
*   **A Confucian perspective:**  While ending corruption is good, the violent methods (throwing people into the river) would likely be condemned as excessive and lacking in proper ritual and due process.  Confucianism emphasizes benevolence and proper conduct.
*   **A utilitarian perspective:** If his actions resulted in greater overall happiness and prosperity for the majority, a utilitarian might argue that the ends justified the means, despite the violence.
*   **A modern perspective:**  Most modern ethical frameworks would strongly condemn the violence and lack of due process, regardless of the positive outcome.

**Q6: At the end of 滑稽列传, it is said that: "傳曰：「子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。」三子之才能誰最賢哉？辨治者當能別之。" -- explain what it means, and whether the comment is fair. (15 points)**

*   **Explanation:** This passage compares 西门豹 to two other famous officials, 子產 (Zi Chan) and 子賤 (Zi Jian). The saying states that under 子產, the people of Zheng could not deceive him; under 子賤, the people of Danfu were unwilling to deceive him; and under 西门豹, the people of Ye dared not deceive him. The question then asks: "Among these three, whose talent was the most virtuous? A discerning administrator should be able to distinguish." It highlights different styles of governance: 子產 inspired trust, 子賤 inspired reluctance to lie, and 西门豹 inspired fear.

*   **Fairness of the comment:** The comment is *partially* fair, but ultimately problematic. It's fair to acknowledge that 西门豹 achieved results – he ended corruption and brought prosperity. However, the emphasis on "dared not deceive" suggests a governance based on fear rather than respect and trust. 子產 and 子賤's approaches, based on inspiring trust and moral integrity, are arguably more virtuous and sustainable forms of leadership. 西门豹's method, while effective in the short term, could create a climate of oppression and stifle genuine communication.
