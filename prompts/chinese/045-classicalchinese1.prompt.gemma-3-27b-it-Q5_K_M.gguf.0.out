## Answers to Questions on 滑稽列传 - 西门豹

**Q1: Give a short summary of the story (5 points)**

西门豹, the magistrate of Ye, discovered the town was impoverished by a yearly ritual of sacrificing a young woman to the River God (河伯) orchestrated by elders, officials, and shamans who pocketed the collected funds. To end this practice, he publicly demanded to see the chosen woman, then dramatically threw the shaman, her disciples, and the elders into the river, terrifying the populace into abandoning the ritual. He then implemented irrigation canals, bringing prosperity to Ye and earning lasting fame.

**Q2: What kind of women were usually the victims in the story (2 points)**

Young, beautiful women were targeted. The text specifically mentions the shamans looking for "good-looking girls" (小家女好者) to be offered to the River God.

**Q3. Who were deemed to benefit from the old practice of offering girls? (2 points)**

The elders (三老), court officials (廷掾), and shamans (祝巫) benefited financially from collecting money from the people under the guise of preparing for the sacrifice.

**Q4: Did the protagonist use wits or force to deal with the situation? Explain (5 points)**

西门豹 primarily used a shocking display of *force* disguised as a logical argument. He used his position and authority to create a public spectacle, leveraging fear and intimidation. While he initially feigned a desire to assess the woman's beauty, this was a ruse to set up the dramatic throwing of the perpetrators into the river. It wasn't subtle wit, but a bold, ruthless act designed to immediately dismantle the practice.

**Q5: Was it moral for the protagonist to do so? Briefly provide views from various perspectives (10 points).**

* **From a utilitarian perspective:** It was arguably moral. The sacrifice impoverished the town and caused fear. His actions, though brutal, ended the practice and brought prosperity to the people. The benefit to the many outweighed the harm to the few.
* **From a deontological (duty-based) perspective:** It was immoral. He took the law into his own hands and executed people without due process. Even if the practice was harmful, he had no right to murder.
* **From a Confucian perspective:** It's complex. While Confucianism values order and respect for authority, it also emphasizes benevolence. His actions were disruptive and lacked ritual propriety, but arguably stemmed from a desire to benefit the people. The lack of proper legal channels would be a major criticism.
* **From the perspective of the victims' families:** Likely seen as a necessary evil, or even heroic, as it ended the threat to their daughters.



**Q6: At the end of 滑稽列传, it is said that: "傳曰：「子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。」三子之才能誰最賢哉？辨治者當能別之。" -- explain what it means, and whether the comment is fair. (15 points)**

This quote compares the governing styles of three historical figures: Zi Chan (子產) of Zheng, Zi Jian (子賤) of Danfu, and Xi Men Bao (西门豹) of Ye. 

* **"民不能欺" (the people could not deceive):**  Zi Chan ruled through moral authority and a well-established legal system, making deception impossible. People feared the consequences of dishonesty.
* **"民不忍欺" (the people did not dare to deceive):** Zi Jian ruled through benevolence and earned the people's trust and respect. They wouldn't *want* to deceive him.
* **"民不敢欺" (the people dared not deceive):** Xi Men Bao ruled through fear and intimidation. The people were afraid of the consequences of being dishonest.

The question then asks which of the three was the most talented. The concluding statement, "辨治者當能別之" (a discerning ruler should be able to distinguish), implies that the best governing style depends on the specific circumstances.

**Is the comment fair?** Yes, it is fair. The comparison highlights the different *methods* used to achieve good governance. Zi Chan's approach is considered the most ideal – a society governed by law and morality. Zi Jian's is also positive, relying on trust. Xi Men Bao's, while effective in stopping the harmful practice,
