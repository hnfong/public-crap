**Q1: Summary of the story**

1. West Gate Bridge (西门豹) becomes the magistrate of Ye (邺令).
2. He discovers that locals are suffering from a practice of "marrying off daughters to the River God (河伯)".
3. The practice is a scam led by local elders and witches to extort money from the people.
4. West Gate Bridge uses a clever ruse to stop the practice by pretending to sacrifice the elders and witches to the River God.
5. He then improves the lives of the people by building irrigation channels, despite initial resistance.

**Q2: Victims in the story**

- Young, beautiful girls from poor families.

**Q3: Beneficiaries of the old practice**

- The three elders (三老) and the witches (巫祝).

**Q4: Protagonist's approach**

- West Gate Bridge primarily uses his wit to deal with the situation.
- He pretends to participate in the ritual and then pretends to sacrifice the elders and witches to the River God, using psychological manipulation to stop the practice.
- He also uses his authority to initiate the construction of irrigation channels, improving the lives of the people.

**Q5: Morality of the protagonist's actions**

- *Utilitarian perspective*: West Gate Bridge's actions are moral because they ultimately benefit the majority of the people by stopping a harmful practice and improving their lives.
- *Deontological perspective*: His actions could be seen as immoral because he uses deception and threatens harm to the elders and witches, violating principles of honesty and non-maleficence.
- *Virtue ethics perspective*: West Gate Bridge demonstrates virtues such as intelligence, courage, and a commitment to the common good, which could be seen as moral.
- *Legal perspective*: His actions might be seen as immoral or illegal because he threatens and intimidates the elders and witches, even if his intentions are good.

**Q6: Explanation and fairness of the comment**

- The comment compares West Gate Bridge with two other historical figures, Zi Chan (子产) and Zi Jian (子贱), based on how they governed their people.
- It suggests that Zi Chan governed in a way that people couldn't bring themselves to deceive him, Zi Jian governed in a way that people wouldn't bear to deceive him, and West Gate Bridge governed in a way that people dared not deceive him.
- The comment is trying to differentiate their governing styles and abilities.
- The comment is somewhat fair as it acknowledges the different approaches and effectiveness of each figure in governing their people. However, it does not provide a definitive answer as to who is the most accomplished, leaving it to the reader to decide based on their own understanding of governance. [end of text]
