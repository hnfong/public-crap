## Translation, Moral, and Western Counterparts of the 荀子 Passage

Here's a breakdown of the passage from 荀子, addressing your three requests:

**(1) English Translation**

Lord Wei Wu (魏武侯) was successful in his deliberations, and no minister could match him. When he left court, he showed joy. Wu Qi (吳起) entered and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu (楚莊王) spoken among his attendants?"

Lord Wei Wu asked, "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?"

Wu Qi replied, "King Zhuang of Chu was successful in his deliberations, and no minister could match him. When he left court, he showed worry. Shen Gong Wuchen (申公巫臣) entered and asked, 'Why do you show worry after a successful court session?' King Zhuang said, 'It is not because I, Zhuang, am successful in my deliberations and no minister can match me that I worry. Rather, it is because the words of Zhongtiao (中蘬) say: 'Those who gain teachers become kings, those who gain allies become hegemons, those who inspire doubt survive, and those who deliberate alone, surpassing all others, perish.' Now, if I, Zhuang, an unworthy ruler, am unmatched by my ministers, my kingdom is near ruin! That is why I worry.' King Zhuang worried, while you rejoice."

Lord Wei Wu stepped back, bowed twice, and said, "You, sir, have corrected my fault."

**(2) Moral of the Story**

The moral of the story is a warning against unchecked dominance in governance.  The passage argues that a ruler who consistently outshines his ministers, who is *always* right and no one can challenge him, is actually creating a dangerous situation for his state.  

The key idea is that a healthy state requires capable ministers who can offer alternative perspectives, challenge the ruler's decisions, and provide checks and balances. If the ruler is always right, it means his ministers are either incompetent, afraid to speak truth to power, or both. This breeds stagnation, makes the state vulnerable to mistakes, and ultimately leads to its downfall. 

King Zhuang of Chu understood this: his success was *precisely* the reason for his worry.  Lord Wei Wu, initially pleased with his own brilliance, was corrected by Wu Qi and humbled by the example of a wiser ruler. The story emphasizes that a ruler's true strength lies not in being always right, but in fostering a court where intelligent debate and constructive criticism can flourish.  

The quote from Zhongtiao is crucial: it highlights the importance of external support (teachers, allies) and the danger of isolation (being unmatched). A ruler who relies solely on his own judgment is setting himself up for failure.

**(3) Western Counterparts**

Yes, the concepts in this story have strong counterparts in Western (European) thought, particularly in classical political philosophy and later in Enlightenment ideas. Here are some examples:

*   **Plato's *Republic*:** Plato discusses the importance of a well-ordered state with different classes (rulers, auxiliaries, producers) each fulfilling their role. While Plato's ideal ruler is wise, the system still relies on the auxiliaries (soldiers/guardians) to challenge and correct the ruler if necessary.  The idea of unchecked power leading to tyranny is a recurring theme.
*   **Aristotle's *Politics*:** Aristotle emphasizes the importance of a "polity" – a mixed constitution that combines elements of democracy and oligarchy. This is designed to prevent any single group from dominating and to ensure that different interests are represented.  The story from 荀子 aligns with Aristotle's concern about the dangers of extreme rule.
*   **Machiavelli's *The Prince*:** While Machiavelli is often seen as amoral, he also stresses the importance of a ruler appearing to be virtuous, even if he isn't. A ruler who is *seen* as infallible can inspire fear, but also resentment. Machiavelli would likely agree that a ruler who alienates his advisors is making a strategic mistake.
*   **Montesquieu's *The Spirit of the Laws*:** Montesquieu's theory of the separation of powers (legislative, executive, judicial) is a direct response to the dangers of concentrated authority. The idea of checks and balances – preventing any one branch of government from becoming too powerful – is a clear parallel to the warning in the 荀子 passage.
*   **Enlightenment Thinkers (Locke, Rousseau):** The Enlightenment emphasis on natural rights, limited government, and the social contract all reflect a distrust of absolute power. The idea that rulers should be accountable to the people (or at least to a representative body) is a direct rejection of the unchecked dominance implied in the story.

**In essence, the Western tradition, like the Chinese one represented by 荀子, recognizes that unchecked power, even if wielded by a competent ruler, is a recipe for disaster. The need for checks, balances, and a healthy political environment where dissent is possible is a universal theme in political thought.**
