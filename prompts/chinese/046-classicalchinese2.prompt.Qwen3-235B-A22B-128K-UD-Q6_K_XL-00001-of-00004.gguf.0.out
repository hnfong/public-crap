### (1) **Translation of the Story into English**

**Original Passage (from 荀子, *Xunzi*):**

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

**English Translation:**

Duke Wu of Wei made decisions wisely, and none of his ministers could match him. After court, he wore a pleased expression. Wu Qi (the famous general and statesman) approached and said: "Have you ever heard of what King Zhuang of Chu said to his attendants?"

Duke Wu asked: "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?"

Wu Qi replied: "King Zhuang of Chu also made wise decisions, and none of his ministers could match him. But after court, he wore a worried expression. Shen Gong Wuchen approached and asked: 'Your Majesty, you seem troubled after court. Why is that?'

King Zhuang said: 'I have made good decisions, and none of my ministers can match me. That is why I am worried. There is a saying from Zhong Xiong: "A prince who believes he has found a teacher will become a king; one who finds an equal will become a hegemon; one who faces opposition may still survive; but one who believes no one is as wise as himself will perish." Now, I am not virtuous, yet none of my ministers can match me. Is my country not nearly doomed to ruin? That is why I am worried.'

King Zhuang of Chu was worried, but you, my lord, are pleased."

Duke Wu hesitated for a moment, then bowed twice and said: "Heaven has sent you, Master, to correct my mistake."

### (2) **Moral of the Story**

The moral of the story is that **a ruler should not be complacent or pleased when no one challenges or rivals his wisdom**. Instead, he should be **concerned**, because the absence of capable advisors or critics is a sign of danger for the state. The story contrasts two rulers:

- **King Zhuang of Chu**, who, despite his own competence, worries that his ministers are not capable enough to challenge or guide him — showing **humility, self-awareness, and concern for the health of the state**.
- **Duke Wu of Wei**, who is **pleased** that he outshines his ministers — showing **pride and a lack of awareness** of the potential risks.

Wu Qi uses the example of King Zhuang to remind Duke Wu that **true wisdom lies in recognizing one's own limitations and valuing the counsel of others**. The story emphasizes the Confucian and Xunzi ideal of **self-cultivation, humility, and the importance of surrounding oneself with capable and honest advisors**.

### (3) **Western Counterparts to the Concepts in the Story**

Yes, the ideas in this story have clear counterparts in **Western (European) political and philosophical thought**, especially in classical and Enlightenment-era writings. Here are a few parallels:

#### a. **Socratic Irony and the Value of Doubt**
In Plato’s dialogues, Socrates often claims to know nothing and constantly questions others, exposing their ignorance. He believed that **true wisdom begins with recognizing one's own ignorance** — a concept similar to King Zhuang’s humility and self-doubt.

> “I know that I know nothing.” — Socrates

This echoes King Zhuang’s concern: if no one can challenge him, he may be dangerously unaware of his own flaws.

#### b. **Montesquieu and the Separation of Powers**
In Enlightenment political philosophy, thinkers like **Montesquieu** emphasized the need for **checks and balances** in government. A ruler or leader should not be surrounded only by yes-men; a healthy state requires **independent institutions and individuals who can challenge authority**.

> “Power should be a check to power.” — Montesquieu

This aligns with the idea that a ruler who faces no opposition or challenge is at risk of making fatal mistakes.

#### c. **The Tyranny of the Wise or the One**
In Aristotle’s *Politics*, he warns against **rule by a single individual**, even if that person is wise. He argues that **collective deliberation** is generally safer and more just than rule by one, because no one person can have all the answers.

> Aristotle distinguishes between *monarchy* (rule by one for the common good) and *tyranny* (rule by one for personal gain), but even a wise ruler should not ignore the counsel of others.

This parallels the idea in the story that a ruler who believes he has no equals is on the path to ruin.

#### d. **The Dangers of Flattery and Groupthink**
In both **Roman** and **British** political traditions, there are warnings about the dangers of **flattery and groupthink** in court or government. For example, in **Tacitus’ *Annals***, he critiques the Roman emperors who surrounded themselves with sycophants, leading to poor decisions and moral decay.

Similarly, in **Shakespeare’s *King Lear***, the tragedy arises when the king is surrounded by flatterers and fails to heed honest counsel.

### Summary

- **Translation**: The story contrasts Duke Wu of Wei’s pride with King Zhuang of Chu’s humility when both outshine their ministers.
- **Moral**: A wise ruler should be **concerned**, not pleased, when no one can challenge or advise him. The absence of capable opposition is a sign of danger, not strength.
- **Western Parallels**: This idea is echoed in the **Socratic method**, **Aristotelian political theory**, **Enlightenment checks and balances**, and warnings against **flattery and groupthink** in both classical and modern Western thought.
