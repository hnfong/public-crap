Okay, so I need to answer these six questions based on the provided text from 滑稽列传. Let me start by reading the text carefully to understand the story and the details.

The story is about 西门豹 (Xi Men Bao) who was the magistrate of 邺 (Ye) during the time of 魏文侯 (Wei Wen Hou). The people were suffering because of a tradition where they offered girls to the river god. The officials and sorcerers would take money from the people, use some to stage a fake wedding for the river god, and keep the rest. They'd take young girls, dress them up, and send them down the river on a decorated boat. This caused many families to flee, leaving the city poor.

西门豹 heard about this and decided to stop it. He attended the ceremony, criticized the practice, and instead of letting them take another girl, he threw the sorceress and her followers into the river. Then, he forced the officials to work on digging canals to bring water to the fields, which made the land fertile and the people prosperous. The people were initially resistant but eventually benefited, and the practice of sacrificing girls stopped.

Now, I'll go through each question one by one.

Q1: Give a short summary of the story. I need to condense the main events. 西门豹 stops the river sacrifice, throws the sorceress and officials into the river, and implements water projects that help the people.

Q2: What kind of women were the victims? They were young girls from poor families, chosen because they were attractive.

Q3: Who benefited from the old practice? The officials and sorcerers took the money collected for themselves.

Q4: Did the protagonist use wits or force? He used both. He tricked them by pretending to send someone to report to the river god, then used force by throwing them into the river.

Q5: Was it moral? From a utilitarian view, it was good because it stopped the sacrifice and helped the people. From a deontological view, it's questionable because he used deception and violence. Culturally, it was seen as a necessary action to stop a harmful tradition.

Q6: The quote at the end compares three figures, saying that under 西门豹, people didn't dare to cheat. The comment suggests he was the most effective because he changed the system so people couldn't cheat, which is fair because his methods led to long-term positive change.

I think I have a good grasp now. I'll structure the answers accordingly, keeping them concise.
