Here is the translation, explanation, and comparative analysis:

## 1. English Translation

**Wei Wu Hou** (魏武侯) was deliberating affairs of state and his decisions were appropriate. None of his ministers could match his wisdom. After leaving the court, he wore a pleased expression on his face.

**Wu Qi** (吳起) then approached and said: "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu from anyone?"

Wu Hou asked: "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?"

Wu Qi replied: "King Zhuang of Chu deliberated affairs of state and his decisions were appropriate. None of his ministers could match his wisdom. After leaving the court, he wore a worried expression.

**Shen Gong Wu Chen** (申公巫臣) asked: 'Your Majesty, why do you look worried after the morning court?'

The King said: 'I deliberated affairs and my decisions were appropriate, yet none of my ministers can match me—that is why I am worried. In the sayings of the court musicians, it is said: "A ruler who gains a teacher becomes a king; a ruler who gains friends becomes a hegemon; a ruler who gains capable counselors survives; a ruler who relies only on himself and has no one better than himself will perish." Now, considering my own lack of virtue, and that none of my ministers can match me—is my state not on the verge of ruin? That is why I worry.'

King Zhuang worried because of this, yet you, My Lord, are pleased."

Wei Wu Hou paused, then bowed twice and said: "It is Heaven that has sent you, Master, to correct my faults."

## 2. Moral of the Story

The core moral is that **a wise ruler should be wary of having no equals or superiors among his ministers**. 

- King Zhuang of Chu understood that if his ministers cannot match his wisdom, it means he lacks talented people to advise him, which threatens the state's survival.
- Wei Wu Hou, by contrast, felt pleased that his ministers were inferior to him—he failed to see the danger.
- Wu Qi uses this contrast to criticize Wei Wu Hou: a ruler should **seek capable ministers and be humble**, not gloat over his own superiority.

The passage reflects Xunzi's (荀子) emphasis on the importance of **selecting worthy ministers** and the **danger of ruler arrogance**.

## 3. Western Counterparts

Yes, there are parallels in Western thought:

- **Plato's "Apology"**: Socrates said the unexamined life is not worth living; he valued critical questioning over self-satisfaction. Like King Zhuang, he believed awareness of one's own ignorance is a virtue.

- **Machiavelli's "The Prince"**: He advised rulers to surround themselves with wise counselors and warned against isolating oneself from honest advice—similar to the "得師者王" (king who gains a teacher) idea.

- **The proverb "Pride goes before a fall" (Proverbs 16:18)**: The idea that excessive self-satisfaction and lack of self-awareness lead to downfall echoes the story's warning.

- **The Socratic method**: Socrates believed that questioning and dialogue with wiser minds leads to truth, contrasting with Wei Wu Hou's complacency.

Thus, while the specific framing (ruler-minister relations) is distinct to Chinese political philosophy, the underlying idea—that one should seek wise counsel and remain humble—is a universal theme. [end of text]
