This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

(1) Translation:

King Wu of Wei was pleased after a court session, during which he had made a wise decision, unmatched by any of his ministers. When he returned to his palace, his delight was evident on his face. Wu Qi noticed this and approached him, asking, "Have you ever heard the story about King Zhuang of Chu, Your Majesty?"

King Wu of Wei replied, "What is the story about King Zhuang of Chu?"

Wu Qi answered, "Once, King Zhuang of Chu made a wise decision, and none of his ministers could match it. When he left the court, his face was filled with worry. Shen Gong, also known as Wu Chen, asked him, 'Why do you look worried after making a wise decision?' King Zhuang replied, 'I am worried because none of my ministers could match my decision. As the proverb goes: "A ruler who finds a teacher among his subjects will become a king; a ruler who finds a friend among his subjects will become a hegemon; a ruler who finds someone who challenges his views will survive; a ruler who only listens to himself and no one can match his wisdom will perish." Since none of my ministers could match my decision, my country is in danger of ruin. That is why I am worried.'"

Hearing this, King Wu of Wei was taken aback, and he knelt down twice, showing his respect to Wu Qi. He said, "You have been sent by heaven to correct my mistake, Master Wu Qi."

(2) The moral of the story is that a wise leader should seek advice and criticism from others, instead of being self-satisfied. A leader who surrounds himself with people who only agree with him is likely to make poor decisions and eventually lead his country to ruin. On the other hand, a leader who listens to different opinions and learns from others will be more successful.

(3) The concept in the story has a counterpart in Western (European) thought, particularly in the ideas of the ancient Greeks. The Greek philosopher Plato, for example, believed that rulers should be philosopher-kings, meaning they should be wise and seek knowledge from others. Similarly, the Roman philosopher Seneca argued that a wise ruler should surround himself with wise and honest advisors. These ideas reflect the belief that a leader should not be self-satisfied and should seek out different perspectives in order to make sound decisions.
