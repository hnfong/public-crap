Okay, I need to answer these questions about the story from 滑稽列传 (The Biographies of Jesters). Let me read through the text carefully first.

The story is about Ximen Bao (西门豹) who was the magistrate of Ye during the time of Marquis Wen of Wei. He found out that the people were suffering because of the practice of "marrying a daughter to the River God" (河伯娶妇). The local elders told him that the village elders and officials were collecting money from the people, taking most of it for themselves, and using a small part to "marry" a girl to the river god. They would select a pretty girl from a poor family, dress her up, and then float her on a mat down the river until she drowned. This caused many families with daughters to flee, making the city poor and empty.

Ximen Bao decided to attend the next ceremony. When the time came, he said the girl wasn't pretty enough and sent the head witch to tell the River God to wait for a better one. He had her thrown into the river. When she didn't come back, he sent her disciples, then the village elders. Everyone was scared, and after that, no one dared to continue the practice. Then Ximen Bao had twelve canals built to irrigate the fields, which made the people prosperous. At first, the people didn't like the hard work, but later they benefited. Even later, when officials wanted to change the canals, the people refused because they were Ximen Bao's work.

Now, let's tackle each question.

Q1: Short summary (5 points). I need to be concise. Key points: Ximen Bao exposed the fraud of river god marriage, stopped it by throwing the witches and elders into the river, built canals for irrigation, brought prosperity.

Q2: What kind of women were victims? From the text: "巫行视小家女好者" — the witches looked for pretty girls from small/poor families ("小家" probably means humble or poor families). So victims were young, pretty daughters of poor families.

Q3: Who benefited? The text says: "邺三老、廷掾常岁赋敛百姓，收取其钱得数百万，用其二三十万为河伯娶妇，与祝巫共分其余钱持归." So the village elders (三老), local officials (廷掾), and the witches (祝巫) were taking the money. They collected millions, used 200-300 thousand for the ceremony, and split the rest.

Q4: Wits or force? He used wits. He pretended to go along with the ritual but then used their own superstition against them. By saying the girl wasn't good enough and sending the witches to report to the river god, he made it seem like he was respecting the tradition but actually eliminating the perpetrators. It was psychological—using their fear of the river god to trap them. He didn't use brute force initially; it was clever manipulation.

Q5: Morality—various perspectives. Need to cover different views. Confucian might say it's justified to stop harm, even if harsh. Legalist might approve of strict punishment. Modern human rights: killing is wrong, extrajudicial. But context: he stopped a harmful tradition, saved lives. Some might argue it was necessary to make an example. Others say due process should be followed. Also, the text says people were scared but then benefited, so outcome was good.

Q6: The quote at the end compares three rulers: Zichan (子產) in Zheng—people couldn't deceive him; Zijian (子賤) in Shanfu—people wouldn't deceive him because they respected him; Ximen Bao in Ye—people didn't dare deceive him because they feared him. The question is who is most virtuous and if the comment is fair.

Explanation: The comment is saying each had a different way: Zichan was so smart people couldn't trick him; Zijian was so virtuous people felt morally compelled not to trick him; Ximen Bao was so strict people were afraid to trick him.

Fairness: The text in the story shows Ximen Bao used fear (throwing people in the river), so "dare not deceive" fits. But is it fair to compare? The passage asks who is most贤 (virtuous). Zijian's method (不忍欺) might be seen as higher because it's based on virtue and trust, while Ximen Bao's is based on fear. But the story praises Ximen Bao highly, saying his legacy lasted. The comment might be fair in describing their methods, but whether it's fair to rank them—depends on values. Confucians might prefer Zijian, Legalists Ximen Bao.

Now, let's write concise answers.

Q1: Ximen Bao, magistrate of Ye, exposed the fraudulent "marriage to the River God" scheme where officials and witches extorted money and drowned girls. He halted the practice by feigning compliance, then executing the perpetrators by throwing them into the river, and later built irrigation canals that brought lasting prosperity to the region.

Q2: Young, attractive daughters from poor families ("小家女好者").

Q3: The village elders (三老), local officials (廷掾), and witches (祝巫) who embezzled public funds collected for the ritual.

Q4: Primarily wits. He pretended to honor the ritual by requesting a better bride for the river god, then used the perpetrators' superstition against them—ordering them to "report" to the river god and drowning them when they "failed" to return. This psychological tactic exploited their own deception without direct confrontation, making the crowd complicit in fearing divine retribution.

Q5: 
- **Utilitarian view**: Moral, as it ended systemic murder and poverty, saving countless lives.
- **Deontological view**: Immoral, as extrajudicial killings violate inherent rights, regardless of outcome.
- **Confucian view**: Justified to eradicate harm, but excessive; virtue should prioritize education over fear.
- **Legalist view**: Moral, as strict punishment deters corruption and ensures order.
- **Modern perspective**: Unethical by today’s standards (due process required), but contextually effective in ending a deadly tradition.

Q6: The quote contrasts three governance styles: Zichan (people *could not* deceive him due to his acumen), Zijian (people *would not* deceive him due to moral respect), and Ximen Bao (people *dared not* deceive him due to fear). The comment is fair in accurately reflecting their methods—Ximen Bao’s reliance on fear aligns with his dramatic execution of the witches. However, ranking their virtue is subjective: Confucianism would favor Zijian’s virtue-based rule as superior, while the text implicitly praises Ximen Bao’s results-driven approach. The assessment is contextually fair but overlooks that fear-based governance may lack sustainability without moral foundation, as seen in Ye’s later resistance to altering Ximen Bao’s canals—suggesting his legacy endured through tangible benefits, not just fear.

### Q1: Short Summary (5 points)  
Ximen Bao, magistrate of Ye, exposed a corrupt scheme where local officials and witches extorted money from villagers under the guise of "marrying a daughter to the River God" (河伯), drowning young girls in the process. He halted the practice by feigning compliance: at the ritual, he declared the chosen girl "unworthy," drowned the head witch and her disciples to "report" to the river god, and terrified officials into silence. Later, he built twelve irrigation canals, transforming agriculture and enriching Ye. His legacy endured as locals preserved his canals centuries later.  

### Q2: Victims' Identity (2 points)  
Young, attractive daughters from poor families ("小家女好者").  

### Q3: Beneficiaries of the Practice (2 points)  
Village elders (三老), local officials (廷掾), and witches (祝巫), who embezzled public funds collected for the ritual.  

### Q4: Wits or Force? (5 points)  
Primarily **wits**. Ximen Bao exploited the perpetrators' superstition by *pretending* to uphold the ritual: he demanded a "better bride" for the river god, then ordered the witch and officials to "report" its failure—drowning them when they "delayed." This psychological tactic used their own deception against them, avoiding open confrontation while leveraging crowd psychology (fear of divine retribution). Minimal force (drowning) was a calculated *consequence* of his ruse, not brute coercion.  

### Q5: Morality Analysis (10 points)  
- **Utilitarian**: Moral—ended systemic murder/poverty, saving lives and enabling prosperity (e.g., canals benefited generations).  
- **Deontological**: Immoral—extrajudicial killings violate inherent rights; due process should precede punishment.  
- **Confucian**: Partially moral—stopping harm aligns with benevolence (仁), but excessive fear (vs. virtue-based rule) contradicts *renzheng* (humane governance).  
- **Legalist**: Moral—strict punishment deters corruption, ensuring order and collective welfare.  
- **Modern Human Rights**: Immoral—violates right to life and fair trial, though context (ending entrenched violence) may mitigate judgment.  

### Q6: Quote Explanation & Fairness (15 points)  
**Meaning**: The quote contrasts three rulers:  
- *Zichan (子產)*: People **could not** deceive him (shrewd discernment).  
- *Zijian (子賤)*: People **would not** deceive him (moral virtue inspired loyalty).  
- *Ximen Bao (西門豹)*: People **dared not** deceive him (fear of punishment enforced compliance).  
It asks which method reflects the highest virtue (*xian*).  

**Fairness**:  
- **Accurate description**: Fits Ximen Bao’s fear-based approach (e.g., drowning perpetrators to end the ritual).  
- **Incomplete assessment**: Overlooks that his "fear" tactic was *temporary*—lasting impact came from *constructive action* (canals), which earned voluntary reverence (e.g., locals preserving his work centuries later). Zijian’s virtue-based rule (*burenqi*) is traditionally Confucian-idealized as superior, but the text implies Ximen Bao’s *results* (prosperity, enduring legacy) justify his methods.  
- **Verdict**: Fair in diagnosing *methods* but narrow in valuing *outcomes*. Ximen Bao’s blend of decisive action and public welfare arguably surpasses mere "fear," making the comparison reductive. The text’s praise ("贤大夫") suggests his pragmatic virtue merits equal standing. [end of text]
