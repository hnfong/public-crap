### Q1: Summary of the Story (5 points)

When西门豹 became the magistrate of Ye, he discovered the locals were impoverished due to a superstitious scam where officials and shamans drowned young girls in the river as "brides for the River God." To end this,西门豹 attended the ceremony and, feigning dissatisfaction with the bride, threw the chief shaman, her disciples, and the local elders into the river to "inform the River God," terrifying the remaining conspirators into submission. He subsequently abolished the practice and constructed twelve irrigation canals. Despite initial public resistance to the labor, the canals brought lasting prosperity, and the people preserved his legacy.

### Q2: Victims of the Practice (2 points)

The victims were young women from poor, humble families ("小家女"). Beautiful girls were targeted because wealthy families could bribe the shamans to spare their daughters, forcing the poor to flee or suffer the loss of their children.

### Q3: Beneficiaries of the Practice (2 points)

The "Three Elders" (三老), county officials (廷掾), and shamans (祝巫) benefited. They collected millions in taxes from the people under the guise of the ritual, spent only a fraction on the ceremony, and divided the remaining money among themselves.

### Q4: Wits or Force? (5 points)

The protagonist used **both**, though he prioritized **wits** to justify the use of force.
*   **Wits:** He employed "fighting poison with poison" (以其人之道还治其人之身). By pretending to participate in the superstition and claiming the victim was "unsuitable," he created a "legitimate" reason to send the perpetrators to check on the River God.
*   **Force:** He utilized the authority of his office and physical power (soldiers) to execute the conspirators by throwing them into the river.
His intelligence lay in manipulating the villains' own logic to destroy them, avoiding a direct rebellion from superstitious locals while effectively ending the practice.

### Q5: Morality of the Protagonist's Actions (10 points)

From a **utilitarian perspective**, his actions were highly moral. He sacrificed a few corrupt individuals to save countless innocent girls and revitalized the region's economy, maximizing the overall well-being of the populace.

From a **legal/procedural perspective**, his actions were problematic. He acted as judge, jury, and executioner without a formal trial, executing the disciples and elders by throwing them into the river, which constitutes extrajudicial killing.

From a **Confucian perspective**, views are mixed. While he displayed *Ren* (benevolence) by saving the people, his method was deceitful and ruthless, lacking the "upright" virtue expected of a moral exemplar. However, his later dedication to infrastructure (benefiting future generations) aligns with the duty of a virtuous official.

### Q6: Analysis of the Comment (15 points)

**Meaning:**
The comment compares three governance styles:
1.  **Zi Chan:** Governed with such transparency and strict laws that people **could not deceive** him.
2.  **Zi Jian:** Governed with such benevolence and moral influence that people **could not bear to deceive** him.
3.  **Xi Men Bao:** Governed with such severity and astuteness that people **dared not deceive** him.
It asks which style is superior.

**Fairness:**
The comment is fair and accurate regarding Xi Men Bao. The story demonstrates that he ruled through fear and awe ("dared not deceive"). He exposed the scam using sharp wit and terrified the officials into submission ("color like dead ash"). He also ignored the people's initial complaints about the canal construction, enforcing his will through authority. While effective, this approach relies on the ruler's capability and fear rather than the moral transformation of the people, contrasting with the more idealized "benevolent rule" of Zi Jian. Thus, the assessment that he ruled by making people "dare not" deceive is a precise characterization of his stern, results-oriented methodology. [end of text]
