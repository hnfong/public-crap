This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

(1) Translation:

When the ruler of Wei considered important matters and made correct decisions that surpassed his ministers, he would leave the court with a joyful expression. Woo Kung asked, "Have you ever heard the words of Zhou Zhuang Wang (King of Chu)?". The ruler of Wei replied, "What did Zhou Zhuang Wang say?" Woo Kung said, "Zhou Zhuang Wang, when deliberating on affairs and making correct decisions that outshone his ministers, would leave the court with a worried expression. Shen Gong Ming, the royal priest, asked, "Why do you have a worried expression?" Zhou Zhuang Wang said, "I make decisions on important matters and surpass my ministers, which makes me worried. This reminds me of the teachings of the Master of Zhou. He said, 'If a ruler has a wise teacher, he will become a king. With a good friend, he will become a prince. With a doubtful ally, he will still survive. If a ruler relies only on himself, he will perish.' Now, with my own lack of wisdom, my ministers cannot match me, and my state may be close to destruction. That's why I'm worried." Wei's ruler said this with joy, while Zhou Zhuang Wang said this with worry. Wei's ruler bowed twice and said, "Heaven has sent you, Master Woo, to correct my mistakes."

(2) Moral of the story:

The story illustrates the importance of self-awareness and humility in leadership. It shows that a wise leader should be concerned and cautious when their decisions outshine their ministers, as it could indicate potential problems. In contrast, a leader who rejoices in their superiority without recognizing the value of others may not be as wise.

(3) Counterparts in Western (European) thought:

The story echoes the concept of "hubris" in Western literature, as seen in Greek tragedies like Sophocles' "Oedipus Rex," where Oedipus' excessive pride and refusal to listen to others' advice led to his downfall. Additionally, the story's themes align with the ideas of Aristotle in his work "Nicomachean Ethics," where he discusses the importance of self-awareness, humility, and the pursuit of a virtuous life for leaders.<|end|>
