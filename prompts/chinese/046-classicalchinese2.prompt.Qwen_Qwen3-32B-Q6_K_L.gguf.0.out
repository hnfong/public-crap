### (1) **Translation of the Story into English**

> **Wei Wu Hou** made a decision that was appropriate and correct, and none of his ministers could match his judgment. After the court session, he left with a look of joy on his face.  
> **Wu Qi** approached and said, "Have you ever heard the words of **Chu Zhuang Wang** from your attendants?"  
> Wu Hou asked, "What did **Chu Zhuang Wang** say?"  
> Wu Qi replied, "When **Chu Zhuang Wang** made a decision that was appropriate and correct, and none of his ministers could match his judgment, he left the court with a look of worry. **Shen Gong Wu Chen** approached and asked, 'Your Majesty, why do you look worried after a successful court session?'  
> Chu Zhuang Wang said, 'I made a decision that was appropriate and correct, and none of my ministers could match my judgment, so I am worried. There is a saying in the **Zhong Fu** (a classical text): "A ruler who has a wise teacher will become a king; one who has a wise friend will become a hegemon; one who has a wise advisor will survive; but one who makes decisions alone and no one can surpass him will perish."  
> Now, I am not a wise or capable ruler, yet none of my ministers can match my judgment. Is my state not close to destruction? That is why I am worried.'"  
> Wu Qi continued, "**Chu Zhuang Wang** was worried, but you are joyful."  
> Wu Hou hesitated and then bowed twice, saying, "May heaven have sent you to correct my mistake."
