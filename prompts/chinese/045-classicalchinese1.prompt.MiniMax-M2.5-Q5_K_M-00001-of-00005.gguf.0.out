**Q1: Summary**  
When Wei Wen Hou appointed Ximen Bao as magistrate of Ye, he discovered that locals were impoverished because of a custom of “marrying” young girls to the River God He Bo. Local officials and witches extorted huge sums for the ceremony and drowned the chosen girl. Ximen Bao tricked the witch and officials by pretending to send them to report to the river god, actually drowning them one after another. He then abolished the practice, and later dug twelve canals to irrigate the fields, making the region prosperous. The people later protected the canal system from later officials who wanted to alter it.

**Q2: Victims**  
The victims were young, pretty girls from poor or ordinary families in the villages of Ye, selected by the witch (“巫”) and the local officials.

**Q3: Beneficiaries of the old practice**  
The three elders (“三老”), the local officials (“廷掾”), and the witch/priest (“巫祝”) – they divided the extorted money (the bulk of the funds collected from the people).

**Q4: Method used**  
Ximen Bao used *wit* (cunning, deception). He pretended to send the witch and officials to “report to the river god,” then drowned them one by one, creating a dramatic scene that terrified the locals and officials. He did not use brute force but clever psychological manipulation.

**Q5: Morality – different perspectives**  
- *Consequentialist*: The act ended a cruel, exploitative practice and saved future victims; the ends justify the means.  
- *Deontological*: Deliberately drowning innocent people (even if they were corrupt) is morally wrong; murder cannot be justified.  
- *Legal*: Ximen Bao exceeded his authority; he executed people without trial.  
- *Cultural/Historical*: The story is a moral fable praising “good governance” in ancient China; the method is seen as heroic.  
- *Modern*: The act is violent vigilantism; while the outcome was good, the process violated human rights.

**Q6: The quote and fairness**  
The quote says: “Zichan governed Zheng, the people could not deceive him; Zijian governed Shanfu, the people could not bear to deceive him; Ximen Bao governed Ye, the people did not dare deceive him.” It ranks three famous magistrates:  
- *Zichan* (wisdom/knowledge) – people cannot deceive him because he is too perceptive.  
- *Zijian* (virtue/benevolence) – people love him so much they cannot bear to deceive.  
- *Ximen Bao* (strictness/force) – people fear punishment, so they do not dare deceive.

*Fairness*: The comment is somewhat reductive. Ximen Bao’s “dare not deceive” stems from fear of his harsh punishment, which is a different level of governance than the moral influence of Zijian or the keen insight of Zichan. However, it captures a truth: his strict, decisive style prevented deception. It is fair in distinguishing the *type* of authority, but it does not rank moral quality—some might argue Zijian’s “cannot bear” is higher than “dare not.” [end of text]
