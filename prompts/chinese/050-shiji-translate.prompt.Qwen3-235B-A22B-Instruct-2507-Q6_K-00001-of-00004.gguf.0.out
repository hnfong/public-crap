"Biography of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang"

Zhang Tingwei Shizhi was a man of Duyang, styled Ji. He lived with his elder brother Zhong. He became a Cavalry郎 by means of wealth registration, serving Emperor Xiaowen. For ten years he received no promotion and was not known for anything. Shizhi said, "Long service in office has depleted Zhong's fortune, and I have accomplished nothing." He wished to resign and return home. The General of Gentlemen, Yuan Ang, knowing his worth, regretted his departure, so he requested that Shizhi be transferred to serve as a Yezhe. After Shizhi finished his audience, he stepped forward and spoke on practical matters. The Emperor said, "Speak plainly; do not go into lofty theories. Say only what can be implemented today." Thereupon Shizhi spoke at length about the period between Qin and Han, explaining why Qin fell and Han arose. The Emperor praised it as good, and immediately appointed Shizhi as Yezhe Pushe.

Shizhi accompanied the Emperor on a tour, ascending the tiger enclosure. The Emperor asked the Superintendent of Shanglin about the records of various animals, posing over ten questions, but the Superintendent looked around left and right, unable to answer any. A minor official of the tiger enclosure stepped forward and answered all the Emperor's questions about the animal records in great detail, wishing to display his ability to respond instantly and fluently. The Emperor said, "Shouldn't officials be like this? This superintendent is worthless!" He then ordered Shizhi to appoint the minor official as the new Superintendent of Shanglin. Shizhi paused a long time before stepping forward and said, "How would Your Majesty describe Marquis Jianghou Zhou Bo?" The Emperor replied, "A man of virtue." Shizhi again asked, "How would you describe Marquis Dongyang Zhang Xianghe?" The Emperor again said, "A man of virtue." Shizhi said, "Both Jianghou and Dongyang are called men of virtue, yet when these two speak on matters, they cannot even utter a word fluently—how could they imitate this minor official's glib, quick-tongued chatter? Moreover, Qin employed clerks skilled in writing and formalities, and officials competed in speed and harsh scrutiny. Yet the defect of this was that it became mere formalism, lacking genuine compassion. As a result, rulers did not hear of their faults, and by the time of the Second Emperor, the empire collapsed. Now, if Your Majesty promotes this minor official merely for his eloquence, I fear the whole empire will follow in fickle fashion, competing in eloquence without substance. Moreover, the influence of superiors on subordinates spreads faster than a shadow or echo; actions and decisions must be carefully considered." The Emperor said, "Well said." He then stopped and did not appoint the minor official.

The Emperor boarded his carriage, summoned Shizhi to ride beside him, and slowly proceeded, asking Shizhi about Qin's failings. Shizhi answered fully and truthfully. Upon reaching the palace, the Emperor appointed Shizhi as Gongcheling.

Shortly after, the Crown Prince and Prince Liang rode together into court, failing to dismount at Sima Gate. Thereupon Shizhi pursued and stopped the Crown Prince and Prince Liang, forbidding them to enter the palace gate. He then charged them with disrespect for failing to dismount at the public gate, and submitted the accusation. When Empress Dowager Bo heard of this, Emperor Wen removed his hat and apologized, saying, "I have failed to properly discipline my sons." Thereupon the Empress Dowager sent an emissary with an imperial pardon for the Crown Prince and Prince Liang, after which they were allowed to enter. From this point, Emperor Wen regarded Shizhi as extraordinary and appointed him Zhong Dafu.

Shortly after, he was promoted to Zhonglangjiang. He accompanied the Emperor to the Baling Mausoleum, standing northward overlooking the latrine. At that time, Lady Shen was accompanying them. The Emperor pointed along the Xin Feng road to Lady Shen and said, "This is the road to Handan." He had Lady Shen play the se, while he himself leaned on the se and sang, his mood sorrowful and melancholy. He turned to his ministers and said, "Alas! If one used stones from the northern mountain for the outer coffin, filled it with hemp floss cut fine and sealed with lacquer in between, how could it ever be moved?" All around said, "Excellent." Shizhi stepped forward and said, "If the tomb contains things that people desire, even if you sealed the southern mountain, there would still be gaps; if it contains nothing desirable, even without a stone coffin, what is there to worry about?" The Emperor acknowledged it as good. Later, he appointed Shizhi as Tingwei.

Shortly after, while the Emperor was traveling out on Zhongwei Bridge, a man ran out from under the bridge, startling the imperial carriage horses. The Emperor sent cavalry to capture him and delivered him to the Tingwei. Shizhi investigated and questioned him. The man said, "I am a county man. Hearing the imperial procession's warning cry, I hid under the bridge. After a long time, thinking the procession had passed, I came out and saw the imperial carriage and riders, so I ran." According to Qin law, one who violates the imperial procession should be fined. Emperor Wen was angry and said, "This man personally startled my horse! Fortunately, my horse is gentle. If it had been another horse, surely I would have been injured or thrown? Yet the Tingwei only fines him!" Shizhi said, "The law is what the Son of Heaven shares with all under heaven. Now, if the law prescribes this punishment and we make it heavier, the law will lose credibility with the people. Moreover, at the moment it happened, if Your Majesty had ordered immediate execution, it would have been done. But now that the case has been referred to the Tingwei, the Tingwei is the upholder of justice for all under heaven. If justice is once tilted, all under heaven will apply the law inconsistently. Where then will the people place their hands and feet? Please consider this carefully." After a long silence, the Emperor said, "The Tingwei's judgment is correct."

Later, someone stole a jade ring placed before the ancestral temple of the High Emperor. The thief was caught, and Emperor Wen was furious, sending the case to the Tingwei for trial. Shizhi examined the law and submitted a report: theft of ancestral temple ritual objects warranted public execution. The Emperor was greatly angered and said, "This man is utterly depraved—he dares to steal from the late Emperor's temple! I referred him to the Tingwei hoping to exterminate his entire clan, yet you apply the law and merely recommend execution. This does not reflect our shared duty to honor the ancestral temple!" Shizhi removed his hat and kowtowed in apology, saying, "The law as it stands is sufficient. Moreover, crimes may be of equal severity, but punishment varies according to degree of wrongdoing. Now, if stealing from the ancestral temple leads to clan extermination, then if by some remote chance a foolish commoner takes a handful of earth from Changling, how would Your Majesty increase the punishment?" After a long time, Emperor Wen discussed it with the Empress Dowager, and then approved the Tingwei's judgment. At that time, the Commandant Zhou Yafu of Tiaohou and the Chancellor of Liang, Wang Tiance of Shandu Hou, saw that Shizhi upheld fair deliberation, and thus formed close friendships with him. From then on, Zhang Tingwei was praised throughout the empire.

Later, when Emperor Wen died and Emperor Jing ascended the throne, Shizhi feared and claimed illness. He wanted to resign, but feared severe punishment; he wanted to appear and apologize, but did not know how he would be received. Following the advice of Wang Sheng, he finally went to apologize, and Emperor Jing did not punish him.

Wang Sheng was a recluse who excelled in Huang-Lao philosophy. Once, when summoned to the court, the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers were all assembled. The old man Wang Sheng said, "My socks have come undone," and turning to Zhang Tingwei, said, "Tie my socks for me!" Shizhi knelt and tied them. Afterward, someone said to Wang Sheng, "Why humiliate Zhang Tingwei in court by making him kneel to tie your socks?" Wang Sheng said, "I am old and lowly, and know I can never benefit Zhang Tingwei. Zhang Tingwei is now a renowned minister under heaven. That is precisely why I briefly humiliated him in court by making him kneel to tie my socks—to enhance his dignity." When the officials heard this, they admired Wang Sheng and respected Zhang Tingwei even more.

Zhang Tingwei served Emperor Jing for over a year as Chancellor of Huainan, still burdened by past anxieties. After a long time, Shizhi died. His son was Zhang Zhi, styled Changgong, who rose to the rank of Daifu, then was dismissed. Because he could not conform to the ways of the world, he never served in office again.

Feng Tang: his grandfather was a man of Zhao. His father moved to Dai. After the Han rose, they moved to Anling. Tang was known for filial piety and served as Chief of the Gentlemen's Bureau, attending Emperor Wen. Once, when the Emperor passed by in his carriage, he asked Tang, "Old man, how did you come to be a郎? Where is your home?" Tang answered fully and truthfully. The Emperor said, "When I was in Dai, my food supervisor Gao Qu often told me about the excellence of Zhao's general Li Qi, who fought at Julu. Now whenever I eat, my thoughts never leave Julu. Do you know of this?" Tang replied, "He was still not as good as Lian Po or Li Mu as generals." The Emperor said, "Why?" Tang said, "My grandfather served in Zhao as a military officer and was close to Li Mu. My father formerly served as Chancellor of Dai and was close to Zhao's general Li Qi, so I know what kind of men they were." When the Emperor heard about the conduct of Lian Po and Li Mu, he was greatly pleased and slapped his thigh, saying, "Alas! If only I had men like Lian Po or Li Mu as my generals, would I worry about the Xiongnu?" Tang said, "Your servant! Even if Your Majesty had Lian Po or Li Mu, you could not use them." The Emperor became angry and rose, entering the inner palace. After a long time, he summoned Tang and rebuked him, saying, "Why did you humiliate me before everyone? Couldn't you find a private place?" Tang apologized, saying, "This humble man does not know taboos."

At that time, the Xiongnu had recently launched a major invasion into Chaona, killing General Ang, the Governor of Beidi. The Emperor was concerned about the barbarian threat, so he finally asked Tang again, "Why do you think I could not use Lian Po or Li Mu?" Tang replied, "I have heard that in ancient times, when a king sent out a general, he knelt and pushed the chariot wheel, saying: 'Within the gate, I control affairs; beyond the gate, the general controls affairs.' Military achievements, ranks, and rewards were all decided in the field and reported upon return. This was no empty saying. My grandfather said that when Li Mu served as Zhao's general on the frontier, the taxes from the military market were all used to feed the soldiers, rewards and gifts were decided in the field without interference from the center. Entrusted with authority and held accountable for results, Li Mu was thus able to fully employ his intelligence and ability. He deployed 1,300 selected chariots, 13,000 archers on horseback, and 100,000 soldiers each worth a hundred gold pieces, thus driving back the Chanyu to the north, defeating the Donghu, destroying Danlin, restraining the powerful Qin to the west, and supporting Han and Wei to the south. At that time, Zhao nearly achieved hegemony. Later, when King Qian of Zhao ascended the throne—his mother was a courtesan—he followed the slander of Guo Kai and finally executed Li Mu, appointing Yan Ju in his place. Thus, the army was defeated, the soldiers fled, and Zhao was captured and destroyed by Qin. Now I secretly hear that Wei Shang serves as governor of Yunzhong, using all the military market taxes to feed his soldiers, spending his own money, slaughtering an ox every five days to feast guests, officers, and attendants, so that the Xiongnu keep far away and do not approach the passes of Yunzhong. Once the enemy did enter, Wei Shang led cavalry and chariots to attack, killing many. These soldiers are all commoners' sons, rising from the fields to serve in the army—how would they know military registers and unit codes? They fight all day, cutting off heads and capturing prisoners, reporting achievements to the headquarters. If a single word does not match, the clerks apply the law to punish them. Rewards are not granted, yet officials strictly enforce the law. In my foolish opinion, Your Majesty's laws are too harsh, rewards too light, and punishments too severe. Moreover, the governor of Yunzhong, Wei Shang, was charged with an error of six heads in reporting enemy casualties. Your Majesty sent him to the officials, stripped his rank, and sentenced him to penal labor. From this, it is clear that even if Your Majesty had Lian Po or Li Mu, you could not use them. I am truly foolish, speaking without regard for taboos—guilty of death, guilty of death!" Emperor Wen was pleased. That day, he ordered Feng Tang to take the imperial symbol and pardon Wei Shang, reappointing him as governor of Yunzhong, and appointed Tang himself as Commander of Chariots and Cavalry, in charge of the capital commandant and the chariot troops of the commanderies and kingdoms.

In the seventh year, Emperor Jing ascended the throne and appointed Tang as Chancellor of Chu, but later dismissed him. When Emperor Wu ascended, seeking worthy and capable men, he nominated Feng Tang. Tang was then over ninety years old and could no longer serve, so Tang's son, Feng Sui, was appointed as a郎. Sui, styled Wangsun, was also an extraordinary man, and was close friends with me.

Grand Historian says: Zhang Ji's words on men of virtue, upholding the law without yielding to personal wishes; Feng Gong's discussion of generals—how profound! How profound! It is said, "If you do not know a man, look at his friends." The virtues praised by these two men deserve to be inscribed in the ancestral temple. The Book says, "Without bias, without partisanship, the royal way is broad and open; without partisanship, without bias, the royal way is clear and bright." Zhang Ji and Feng Gong come close to this.
