This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

(1) Translation:
魏武侯 was planning a matter and made a sound decision, outperforming all his ministers. Upon leaving the court, he had an expression of joy.吴起 approached him and said, "Have you ever heard the story of what楚庄王 said to his attendants?"武侯 replied, "What did楚庄王 say?"吴起 answered, "When楚庄王 made a sound decision and his ministers couldn't match his wisdom, he left the court with a worried look on his face.申公巫臣 asked him, 'Your Highness, you seem worried after making a good decision, why is that?'庄王 replied, 'I made a good decision, but none of my ministers could match me. That's why I'm worried. In the words of one of my advisors, 'A ruler who finds a true mentor becomes a king, one who finds a friend becomes a hegemon, one who finds a rival survives, but one who relies solely on their own counsel without anyone to challenge them will perish.' Since I'm not as capable as my ministers, and yet they can't catch up to me, our state is almost on the verge of灭亡! That's why I'm worried.'楚庄王 was worried, while Your Highness is pleased." 武侯 hesitated, bowed twice, and said, "The divine has sent you to correct my mistake."

(2) Moral of the story:
The moral of the story is that a wise leader should not be complacent when they outshine their advisors. Instead, they should be concerned that their ministers may not be able to provide critical feedback or different perspectives, which could lead to potential dangers for the state. A true leader acknowledges the importance of being challenged and having a diverse range of opinions to make informed decisions.

(3) Western counterpart:
This concept has a parallel in Western thought, particularly in the idea of "Machiavellian Prudence" as described by Niccolò Machiavelli in "The Prince." Machiavelli emphasizes the importance of a prince having advisors who are honest in their criticisms and not just flattering. A wise ruler should surround themselves with competent advisors who can challenge their decisions and ensure they are well-informed. This concept is also present in the ancient Greek idea of "hubris," which refers to overconfidence or arrogance that often leads to a ruler's downfall. Both Western philosophies reinforce the idea that a leader should not be content with their own superiority but should seek diverse opinions to maintain a balanced and effective rule.<|im_end|>
