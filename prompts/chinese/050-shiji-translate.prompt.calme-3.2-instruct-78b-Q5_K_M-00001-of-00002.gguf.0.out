In the "Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang Biographies" chapter,

Zhang Tingwei Shizhi, a native of Du Yang, had the courtesy name Ji. He had an elder brother named Zhong, with whom he lived. He became a cavalry officer through his wealth, serving Emperor Xiaowen, but for ten years he was not reassigned, remaining unknown. Shizhi said, "My long service has depleted my brother Zhong's assets, and it's not going well." He wanted to resign and return home. The Middle General Yuan Ang knew of his talent and regretted his departure, so he requested that Shizhi be reassigned as a royal attendant. After Shizhi had completed his court duties, he took the opportunity to discuss matters of convenience. Emperor Wen said, "Lower the discussion, don't overly theorize, let's talk about what can be implemented now." Then Shizhi spoke at length about events between the Qin and Han dynasties, explaining why the Qin fell and the Han rose. Emperor Wen approved, and appointed Shizhi as the royal attendant's chief.

Shizhi accompanied the emperor, ascending the tiger enclosure. The emperor asked the Shanglin official about the records of various animals, asking over ten questions, but the official looked around, unable to answer. A tiger enclosure official stepped in to answer the emperor's questions about the animal records in great detail, demonstrating his quick-witted and responsive nature. Emperor Wen said, "Shouldn't officials be like this? The official is unreliable!" He then ordered Shizhi to appoint the official as the Shanglin Prefect. Shizhi, after a long pause, asked, "What kind of person does Your Majesty consider the Duke of Jiang, Zhou Bo?" The emperor said, "He's a senior figure." Shizhi asked again, "What kind of person is the Duke of Dongyang, Zhang Xiang?" The emperor replied, "A senior figure." Shizhi said, "The Duke of Jiang and the Duke of Dongyang are considered senior figures, yet these two can barely articulate their thoughts, would they emulate this official's eloquent and quick-tongued nature? Moreover, the Qin dynasty relied on clerical officials, with officials competing to be more diligent and meticulous, but their shortcomings were merely formalities, lacking genuine compassion. Therefore, they didn't hear of their faults, and the decline led to the Second Emperor, with the empire collapsing. Now, Your Majesty is promoting this official due to his eloquence, I fear the world will follow this trend, competing in eloquence without substance. And the lower ranks emulate the higher ranks faster than the shadow follows the light, so actions must be carefully considered." Emperor Wen said, "Well," and stopped the promotion of the official.

As the emperor got into the carriage, he summoned Shizhi to ride with him, proceeding slowly, asking Shizhi about the problems of the Qin dynasty. Shizhi fully explained the issues in a straightforward manner. Upon reaching the palace, the emperor appointed Shizhi as the chief of the public carriage.

After a while, the Crown Prince and Prince of Liang entered the court together in a carriage, not dismounting at the Sima Gate. Shizhi then stopped the Crown Prince and Prince of Liang from entering the palace gate. He then impeached them for not dismounting at the public gate, showing disrespect, and reported it. Empress Dowager Bo heard about it, and Emperor Wen removed his hat in apology, saying, "I've been careless in educating my son." Empress Dowager Bo then sent a messenger with an imperial decree to pardon the Crown Prince and Prince of Liang, allowing them to enter. Emperor Wen was impressed by Shizhi's actions and appointed him as a middle doctor.

After a while, he became a Middle General. Accompanying the emperor to Badaling, they were north of the toilet. At this time, Empress Shenshen was accompanying them, and the emperor pointed out the new Feng road to Empress Shenshen, saying, "This is the road to Handan." He had Empress Shenshen play the zither, while he leaned against the zither and sang, his mood was sorrowful and filled with melancholy. He looked at his ministers and said, "Ah! If we use the stones of the northern mountain for the coffin, use hemp and cotton to fill the gaps, and lacquer the spaces, how could it be moved?" Everyone around him said, "Good." Shizhi stepped forward and said, "If there is something desirable inside, even if the southern mountain is sealed, there will still be a gap; if there is nothing desirable inside, even without a stone coffin, why worry?" Emperor Wen approved. Afterward, Shizhi was appointed as Tingwei.

After a while, the emperor was traveling out of the Zhongwei Bridge, when a man ran out from under the bridge, startling the carriage horse. The emperor then ordered the cavalry to capture him, handing him over to the Tingwei. Shizhi investigated and questioned him. He said, "I'm a county person, I heard the imperial procession, hid under the bridge. After a long time, I thought the procession had passed, so I came out, and when I saw the imperial carriage and horse, I ran." The Tingwei's judgment was that one person had violated the imperial procession, should be fined. Emperor Wen was angry, saying, "This person personally startled my horse, if it were another horse, wouldn't it have injured me? And the Tingwei only judged him a fine?" Shizhi said, "The law is what the emperor shares with the world. Now, if the law is like this and you change it to be more severe, the law will not be trusted by the people. And at that time, if the emperor had ordered him to be executed immediately, it would have been done. Now that it has been handed over to the Tingwei, the Tingwei is the balance of the world, if it tilts, the whole world's use of law will be uneven, where will the people place their hands and feet? Please, Your Majesty, consider this." After a long time, the emperor said, "The Tingwei's judgment is correct."

Afterward, someone stole a jade ring from the front of the Gao Miao, was caught, Emperor Wen was angry, handed it over to the Tingwei for trial. Shizhi, following the law, reported that stealing from the imperial temple's service items, the sentence was to be executed in the market. The emperor was greatly angry, saying, "How dare a person, without morals, steal from the temple of the former emperor, I handed him over to the Tingwei, wanting to execute his whole family, and you report it according to the law, this is not my intention to jointly serve the imperial temple." Shizhi removed his hat and bowed to apologize, saying, "The law is like this, it's enough. And the crimes are equal, but there's a difference in the order of events. Now, if you execute the whole family for stealing from the imperial temple, if there's a one in ten thousand chance, suppose a foolish person takes a handful of earth from Changling, what law can you apply to him?" After a long time, Emperor Wen discussed it with Empress Dowager, then agreed to the Tingwei's judgment. At this time, the Middle Marshal, the Duke of Tiao, Zhou Yafu, and the Duke of Shandu, Wang Tiankai, seeing Shizhi's fair argument, became close friends with him. Zhang Tingwei was thus praised by the whole world.

After Emperor Wen's death, Emperor Jing ascended the throne, Shizhi was afraid, claiming illness. He wanted to resign, fearing a severe punishment would come; he wanted to apologize, but didn't know how. Following Wang Sheng's advice, he finally apologized, and Emperor Jing did not fault him.

Wang Sheng was good at speaking about the Yellow Emperor and Laozi's philosophy, a hermit. He was once summoned to the court, where all the three dukes and nine ministers were present, Wang Sheng, being an old man, said "My shoe is untied," and turned to Zhang Tingwei, "Tie my shoe for me!" Shizhi knelt down and tied it. Afterward, someone said to Wang Sheng, "Why did you humiliate Zhang Tingwei in the court, making him kneel to tie your shoe?" Wang Sheng said, "I'm old and lowly, I estimate I can't be of any benefit to Zhang Tingwei. Zhang Tingwei is currently a famous minister in the world, I deliberately humiliated him, making him kneel to tie my shoe, wanting to elevate his status." The ministers heard this, respected Wang Sheng and esteemed Zhang Tingwei.

Zhang Tingwei served Emperor Jing for over a year, becoming the Prince of Huainan's advisor, still affected by his previous mistake. After a long time, Shizhi passed away. His son was named Zhi, with the courtesy name Changgong, he served as a doctor, then was dismissed. Due to his inability to please the world, he never served in office for the rest of his life.

Feng Tang, his great-grandfather was from Zhao. His father moved to Dai. After the founding of the Han dynasty, they moved to Anling. Feng Tang was known for his filial piety, serving as the chief of the Middle Hall, serving Emperor Wen. When Emperor Wen's sedan passed by, he asked Feng Tang, "Old man, why did you become a hall official? Where is your home?" Feng Tang provided a detailed response. Emperor Wen said, "When I was in Dai, my food supervisor Gao Qu repeatedly told me about the bravery of Zhao's general Li Qi, fighting under Jushu. Now, every time I eat, my thoughts are always in Jushu. Do you know about it?" Feng Tang replied, "It's not as good as Liangpo and Li Mu's generalship." The emperor asked, "Why?" Feng Tang said, "My great-grandfather was in Zhao when he was a cavalry commander, befriended Li Mu. My father was once the Prince of Dai's advisor, befriended Zhao's general Li Qi, knowing his character." The emperor, having heard about Liangpo and Li Mu's character, was pleased, and slapped his thigh, saying, "Ah! If only I could have Liangpo and Li Mu as my generals, would I worry about the Xiongnu!" Feng Tang said, "My lord, even if you had Liangpo and Li Mu, you wouldn't be able to use them." The emperor was angry, got up and went into the inner palace. After a long time, he summoned Feng Tang and rebuked him, "Why did you publicly humiliate me, couldn't you find a private place?" Feng Tang apologized, "A rustic doesn't know the taboos."

At that time, the Xiongnu had just invaded Chaona in large numbers, killing the Northern Earth Prefect Ang. The emperor was concerned about the Xiongnu's invasion, so he finally asked Feng Tang again, "How do you know I can't use Liangpo and Li Mu?" Feng Tang replied, "I heard that in ancient times, when kings dispatched generals, they would kneel and push the chariot wheel, saying that within the country, the king would control it; outside the country, the general would control it. Military merit and rewards were all decided outside, then reported back. This is not an empty statement. My great-grandfather said, when Li Mu was Zhao's general stationed at the border, the tax from the military market was all used to treat the soldiers, rewards were decided outside, not interfered with from the center. Entrusting responsibility and demanding success, so Li Mu was able to fully utilize his intelligence, sending out a selection of 1,300 chariots, 13,000 mounted archers, 100,000 elite soldiers, thus driving the Chanyu to the north, defeating the Donghu, destroying Danlin, suppressing the strong Qin to the west, supporting Han and Wei to the south. At that time, Zhao was almost a hegemon. Afterward, when King Qian of Zhao ascended the throne, his mother was a courtesan. King Qian ascended the throne, then used Guo Kai's slander, finally executed Li Mu, replacing him with Yan Ju. This led to the defeat of the army and the fleeing of the soldiers, being captured and destroyed by the Qin. Now, I've heard that Wei Shang was the Yunzhong Prefect, the tax from his military market was all used to treat the soldiers, using his own money, every five days he would slaughter a cow, treating guests, military officials, and servants, thus the Xiongnu avoided it, not approaching the Yunzhong border. The Xiongnu once invaded, Shang led the chariots and cavalry to attack them, killing many of them. The soldiers were all commoners' sons, coming from the fields to join the army, how would they know about the military register and the military code. Fighting all day, beheading enemies and capturing prisoners, reporting their achievements to the general's office, if one word didn't match, the civil officials would use the law to bind them. The rewards were not given, but the officials strictly enforced the law. I'm foolish, I think the emperor's law is too clear, the rewards are too light, the punishments are too heavy. Moreover, the Yunzhong Prefect Wei Shang was sentenced for the difference in the number of heads and captives, the emperor handed him over to the officials, demoted his rank, and punished him with labor. From this, you can say, even if you had Liangpo and Li Mu, you wouldn't be able to use them. I'm indeed foolish, I've touched upon taboos, I deserve death, I deserve death!" Emperor Wen was pleased. That day, he ordered Feng Tang to hold the imperial seal and pardon Wei Shang, reinstating him as the Yunzhong Prefect, and appointed Feng Tang as the cavalry marshal, overseeing the Middle Marshal and the charioteers of the counties and states.

In the seventh year, Emperor Jing ascended the throne, appointing Feng Tang as the Prince of Chu's advisor, then was dismissed. Emperor Wu ascended the throne, seeking virtuous and talented individuals, recommended Feng Tang. At that time, Feng Tang was over ninety years old, unable to serve in office again, so his son Feng Sui was appointed as a palace attendant. Sui's courtesy name was Wangsun, also an extraordinary person, and was friendly with me.

The Grand Historian said: Zhang Ji's words about senior figures, upholding the law without flattery; Feng Gong's discussion about military leaders, how profound! How profound! It's said, "To know a person, look at his friends." The two gentlemen' praise, can be inscribed in the temple. The Book says, "If not biased or partial, the king's way is broad; if not partial or biased, the king's way is straight." Zhang Ji and Feng Gong are close to this. [end of text]
