 A1: The story is about Ximen Bao, who was an official in the state of Wei during the Warring States period. When he became the prefect of Yi (present-day Kaifeng), he discovered that the local practice of offering girls to the River God every year had impoverished the people. He decided to end this practice and redirected the river water to irrigate the fields instead. The people initially resisted, but Ximen Bao persisted and eventually won them over.

A2: The women who were usually the victims in the story were young, unmarried women from poor families.

A3: The officials and the wealthy families were deemed to benefit from the old practice of offering girls. They used the funds collected from the people to offer a girl to the River God, and then divided the remaining money among themselves.

A4: Ximen Bao used a combination of wits and force to deal with the situation. He first tried to reason with the officials and the wealthy families, but when they refused to listen, he took drastic action by throwing them into the river. This act of force demonstrated his determination to end the practice and ultimately won the people's respect.

A5: The moral implications of Ximen Bao's actions are complex and open to interpretation. From a utilitarian perspective, Ximen Bao's actions were justified because they ended a harmful practice and brought about greater good for the majority of the people. However, from a deontological perspective, Ximen Bao's actions could be considered immoral because he violated the principles of respect for individual autonomy and the rule of law. Ultimately, the moral evaluation of Ximen Bao's actions depends on one's ethical framework and values.

A6: The passage is saying that the three sons of a certain person, Zi Sheng, had different abilities. Zi Chan was able to govern the state of Zheng, Zi Li
