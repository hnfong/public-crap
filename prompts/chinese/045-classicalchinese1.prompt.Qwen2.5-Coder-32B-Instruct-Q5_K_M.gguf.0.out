### Q6: Explanation and Fairness of the Comment
The comment compares the governance styles of three officials: Zichan of Zheng, Zijian of Danfu, and Ximen Bao of Yecheng. It suggests that Zichan's governance made people unable to deceive him, Zijian's made people unwilling to deceive him, and Ximen Bao's made people dare not deceive him. The comment implies that Ximen Bao's governance was the most effective in maintaining order and integrity. This comment is fair in recognizing Ximen Bao's significant achievements in ending corruption and improving the lives of the people, although it is subjective and based on different criteria for effective governance.
