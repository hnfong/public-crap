This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

## Translation and Analysis of the Xunzi Passage:

**(1) English Translation:**

Duke Wu of Wei planned a strategy and successfully executed it, leaving his ministers unable to grasp its intricacies. Upon retiring from court, he displayed a joyful expression. Wu Qi stepped forward and said, "Have you, my lord, ever heard the words of Duke Huan of Chu recounted by those around him?" Duke Wu inquired, "What were Duke Huan's words?" Wu Qi replied, "Duke Huan, after successfully implementing a plan surpassing his ministers' understanding, retired with a worried countenance. Shen Gong, his minister, inquired, 'Your Majesty, why the concern after such a triumph?' Duke Huan responded, 'My unease stems from the fact that, despite my success, none of my ministers could comprehend the strategy. This aligns with the adage: "A ruler who secures capable advisors becomes king, one who fosters alliances becomes hegemon, one who cultivates suspicion ensures survival, and one who lacks insightful counsel perishes." Now, my own inadequacy, coupled with my ministers' inability to match my vision, portends peril for our state. Hence, my worry.' Duke Huan expressed concern, yet Your Lordship rejoices." Duke Wu, pondering deeply, bowed twice and exclaimed, "Master Wu Qi, you have awakened me to my own shortcomings!"

**(2) Moral of the Story:**

The story highlights the **danger of complacency and the paramount importance of wise counsel**. While Duke Wu celebrates personal success, Wu Qi emphasizes that a true leader **should be humbled by the inability of their ministers to grasp complex strategies**. This signifies a lack of shared understanding and potentially flawed decision-making, ultimately threatening the state's stability. True strength lies not in individual brilliance but in **cultivating a court of capable advisors** who can challenge, refine, and contribute to sound governance. Duke Huan's wisdom serves as a cautionary tale, urging leaders to **value collective intelligence over solitary triumph**.

**(3) Western Counterparts:**

The concepts resonate strongly with Western philosophical and political thought:

* **Plato's Philosopher-King:** Plato advocated for rule by philosopher-kings, individuals possessing profound wisdom and understanding, capable of discerning the common good. This aligns with the emphasis on **intellectual leadership** and surrounding oneself with competent advisors, mirroring Wu Qi's critique of Duke Wu's complacency.
* **Cicero's Counsel of the Wise:** Cicero stressed the necessity of a council composed of experienced and virtuous individuals to advise rulers. This echoes the **value placed on collective wisdom** and diverse perspectives, preventing isolation and potential errors in judgment, as exemplified by Duke Huan's concern.
* **Machiavelli's "The Prince":** While Machiavelli emphasizes pragmatism and cunning, he also acknowledges the importance of surrounding oneself with **trustworthy and intelligent counselors** to navigate complex political landscapes. This reinforces the notion that **sole reliance on personal insight is insufficient** for effective governance.

In essence, the Xunzi passage's moral finds parallels in Western thought, emphasizing the **critical role of wise counsel, intellectual humility, and collaborative decision-making** for responsible and sustainable leadership. [end of text]
