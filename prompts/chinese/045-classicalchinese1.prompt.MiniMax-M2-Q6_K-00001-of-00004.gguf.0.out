**Q1. Short summary (5 points)**  
- In the Warring States period, the magistrate of Ye, Ximen Bao, discovers that the local elite (elders, officials, and a witch) are extorting money by “marrying” girls to the River God, then drowning them.  
- Ximen Bao feigns cooperation, invites the witch and her disciples to the river, and throws them in one by one, then the elders, to “ask the River God” for a better bride.  
- The terrified crowd abandons the practice.  
- Ximen Bao then builds twelve irrigation canals to flood the fields, improving agriculture and wealth.  
- The people later defend the canals against later officials who want to alter them, honoring Ximen Bao’s legacy.

**Q2. Victims (2 points)**  
- Young women from poor families, selected by the witch for their looks.

**Q3. Who benefited from the old practice (2 points)**  
- The three elders, the officials, the witch and her disciples, who shared the extorted money.

**Q4. Wits vs. force (5 points)**  
- Primarily **wit**: Ximen Bao uses a staged ritual to expose and punish the fraud, turning the witch’s own “communication with the River God” against her.  
- The physical act of throwing people in is a **forceful** execution of the plan, but it is a calculated, theatrical use of force to achieve a moral end.

**Q5. Morality of Ximen Bao’s actions (10 points)**  
- **Consequentialist/Utilitarian**: Yes—ending a murderous racket, saving lives, and improving welfare outweighs the deaths of the corrupt.  
- **Deontological/Kantian**: No—deliberately killing the witch and elders violates the duty not to use people merely as means; even if they are corrupt, due process is owed.  
- **Virtue ethics**: Yes—courage, justice, and practical wisdom (phronesis) are exemplified; the act is proportionate to the evil.  
- **Legal/Procedural**: Mixed—summary execution without trial is unjust, but the context (systemic corruption, lack of courts) may justify extraordinary measures.  
- **Religious/ritual**: The witch’s “communication” is a lie; exposing it is morally justified, but killing her disciples may be seen as excessive.  
- **Modern human rights**: No—summary killings violate the right to life and due process.  
- **Historical/communal**: Yes—collective memory preserves Ximen Bao as a protector; the ends (ending terror, prosperity) justify the means in the narrative’s moral calculus.

**Q6. Meaning of the quote and fairness (15 points)**  
- **Meaning**:  
  - Zichan (Zheng): people “cannot deceive” him—his intelligence and institutions prevent fraud.  
  - Zijian (Shanfu): people “cannot bear to deceive” him—his moral charisma inspires voluntary honesty.  
  - Ximen Bao (Ye): people “dare not deceive” him—his stern, punitive rule creates fear of consequences.  
- **Fairness**:  
  - The comment is **historically plausible** and highlights three distinct governance styles: institutional, moral, and coercive.  
  - It is **fair** in that each style has strengths and weaknesses: Zichan’s system is durable, Zijian’s is humane, Ximen’s is effective against entrenched corruption.  
  - It is **unfair** if taken as a ranking: Ximen’s “dare not” is not necessarily superior; it relies on fear, which can breed resentment, whereas Zichan’s and Zijian’s approaches foster trust and self-governance.  
  - The comment is a **literary device** to contrast methods, not a definitive moral hierarchy; each is “贤” (worthy) in its context. [end of text]
