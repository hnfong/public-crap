### Q1: Short Summary of the Story
West Gate Tao (西门豹) was appointed as the magistrate of Ye (邺). He discovered that the local people were suffering because of a superstition involving the River God (河伯) who was believed to require a bride every year. The local officials and priests exploited this belief to extort money from the people. West Gate Tao decided to put an end to this practice by tricking the officials and priests into thinking that the River God was angry with them. He then ordered the construction of irrigation canals to benefit the people, which improved their lives significantly.

### Q2: Kind of Women Usually the Victims
The victims were usually young girls from poor families who were chosen by the priests to be offered to the River God.

### Q3: Beneficiaries of the Old Practice
The local officials (三老), the priests (祝巫), and the wealthy landowners (豪长者) benefited from the old practice as they extorted money from the people and shared the proceeds among themselves.

### Q4: Use of Wits or Force
West Gate Tao primarily used his wit to deal with the situation. He tricked the officials and priests into thinking that the River God was angry with them by ordering them to be thrown into the river. This clever ruse effectively ended the practice without resorting to physical force.

### Q5: Morality of the Protagonist's Actions
- **Moral Perspective**: West Gate Tao's actions can be seen as morally justified because he was stopping a harmful and exploitative practice that was causing suffering to the people.
- **Legal Perspective**: From a legal standpoint, his actions might be seen as extreme, but they were taken in the absence of a strong legal system to protect the people.
- **Ethical Perspective**: Ethically, his actions can be debated. While he stopped a harmful practice, he also used deception and potentially endangered the lives of the officials and priests.
- **Utilitarian Perspective**: From a utilitarian standpoint, his actions were beneficial because they improved the overall well-being of the community by ending the exploitation and providing irrigation.

### Q6: Explanation and Fairness of the Comment
The comment compares the governance styles of three officials: Zi Chan (子产) in Zheng, Zi Jian (子贤) in Shanfu, and West Gate Tao in Ye. It suggests that:
- Zi Chan's governance was such that the people could not deceive him.
- Zi Jian's governance was such that the people did not dare to deceive him.
- West Gate Tao's governance was such that the people did not dare to deceive him.

The comment is fair in highlighting the different approaches to governance and the effectiveness of each official in maintaining order and justice. It acknowledges that all three officials were successful in their own ways, but it does not rank them in terms of who was the most virtuous or skilled. Instead, it emphasizes the unique strengths of each official in maintaining social order and justice. [end of text]
