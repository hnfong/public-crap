### Q1: Short Summary (5 points)
During the reign of Marquis Wen of Wei, Ximen Bao was appointed magistrate of Ye. Upon arrival, he discovered the local populace was impoverished due to a corrupt tradition of "marrying girls to the River God" to prevent floods, a scheme orchestrated by local elders and shamans to extort money and sacrifice young women. Ximen Bao feigned participation in the ceremony but used the pretext that the chosen girl was unattractive to throw the head shaman, her disciples, and the corrupt elders into the river one by one to "report" to the god. Terrified by his actions, the survivors confessed the fraud. Ximen Bao then mobilized the people to dig twelve irrigation canals, transforming the region's agriculture and securing its prosperity for generations.

### Q2: Victims of the Practice (2 points)
The victims were **young girls from poor families** ("小家女好者"). The text specifies that families with attractive daughters feared they would be selected, leading many to flee the city with their children to avoid this fate.

### Q3: Beneficiaries of the Old Practice (2 points)
The primary beneficiaries were the **local corrupt officials and religious figures**: specifically the "Three Elders" (三老), the court clerks (廷掾), and the shamans/priestesses (祝巫). They collected millions in taxes from the people, used a fraction for the ceremony, and divided the substantial surplus among themselves.

### Q4: Wits or Force? (5 points)
Ximen Bao primarily used **wits (strategic intelligence)** rather than brute force, though the outcome was physically violent.
*   **Explanation:** He did not immediately arrest or execute the culprits through standard legal procedure, which might have caused unrest or allowed them to claim martyrdom for the "god." Instead, he adopted their own logic and superstition against them. By pretending to support the ritual and demanding a "better" bride, he created a scenario where the only logical conclusion (within their own belief system) was that the intermediaries needed to go to the river to fetch the god. This psychological tactic exposed the fraud publicly and terrified the survivors into submission without a formal trial, effectively breaking the superstition through irony.

### Q5: Moral Analysis (10 points)
Whether Ximen Bao's actions were moral depends on the ethical framework applied:

*   **Utilitarian Perspective (Highly Moral):** His actions saved countless future lives, ended the financial exploitation of the poor, and brought long-term prosperity through irrigation. The death of a few corrupt individuals prevented the death and suffering of many innocents. The end result (great good for the majority) justifies the means.
*   **Deontological/Legalistic Perspective (Questionable):** From a strict rule-of-law standpoint, executing people without a formal trial, confession, or imperial decree is extrajudicial killing. He acted as judge, jury, and executioner instantly. A strict deontologist might argue that violating procedural justice undermines the rule of law, regardless of the victims' guilt.
*   **Contextual/Historical Perspective (Moral):** In a context where the "law" was corrupted by superstition and the officials *were* the criminals, standard legal channels were likely ineffective or complicit. His dramatic action was necessary to shatter a deeply entrenched cultural delusion that rational argument alone could not fix.
*   **Religious/Superstitious Perspective (Immoral to contemporaries):** To the believers at the time, he appeared to be murdering holy intermediaries and offending the River God, potentially risking divine wrath (floods). However, the subsequent lack of floods and increase in wealth disproved this view historically.

**Conclusion:** While legally irregular, his actions are widely regarded as morally justified due to the extreme corruption, the immediate threat to life, and the immense long-term benefit to society.

### Q6: Analysis of the Final Comment (15 points)
**Meaning of the Quote:**
The quote compares three famous administrators:
1.  **Zi Chan (Zheng):** The people **could not deceive** him (due to his sharp insight and administrative competence).
2.  **Zi Jian (Shanfu):** The people **could not bear to deceive** him (due to his moral virtue and benevolence which inspired love).
3.  **Ximen Bao (Ye):** The people **dared not deceive** him (due to his strictness, decisiveness, and the fear of consequences).
The text asks which is best and suggests that a true analyst of governance should be able to distinguish the nuances.

**Is the Comment Fair?**
Yes, the comment is **fair and insightful**, though it highlights different styles of governance rather than ranking them absolutely.

*   **Accuracy:** It accurately captures Ximen Bao's method. He ruled through "awe" (威). He broke the superstition not by gentle persuasion (like Zi Jian) or just by outsmarting liars (like Zi Chan), but by instilling a profound fear of crossing the line between order and chaos. The people stopped the "River God" marriages because they were terrified of sharing the shamans' fate.
*   **Nuance:** The quote implies a hierarchy often debated in Confucian thought: ruling by virtue (making people *not want* to do wrong) is traditionally seen as superior to ruling by fear (making people *afraid* to do wrong). However, the text defends Ximen Bao by noting his legacy ("benefits flow to later generations").
*   **Contextual Necessity:** In the specific case of Ye, "fear" was likely the *only* effective tool. The corruption was tied to deep-seated religious fear. A benevolent approach might have been ignored, and mere cleverness might not have broken the cycle. Ximen Bao's "dare not" was the precise medicine needed for that specific societal disease.
*   **Verdict:** The comment is fair because it correctly identifies his governing style. While Confucian orthodoxy might favor Zi Jian's approach, history validates Ximen Bao's effectiveness. The "best" ruler depends on the times and the specific challenges faced; for a superstitious and corrupt Ye, Ximen Bao's terrifying efficiency was the most "worthy" (贤) approach. [end of text]
