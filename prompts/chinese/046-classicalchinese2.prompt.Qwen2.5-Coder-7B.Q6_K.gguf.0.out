This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

Sure, here's the translation of the story into English:

"King Wei of Wei was planning something and it turned out to be correct, but none of his ministers could match him. After returning from court, he had a happy expression on his face. Wuqi approached him and asked if he had ever heard about the words of Duke Zhuang of Chu from anyone around him. King Wei replied, 'What were the words of Duke Zhuang?' Wuqi responded, 'Duke Zhuang planned something and it turned out to be correct, but none of his ministers could match him. After returning from court, he had a worried expression. Shen Gong Wuxi asked him, "Why do you have a worried expression, Your Majesty?" Duke Zhuang said, "I planned something and it turned out to be correct, but none of my ministers could match me, so I am worried. There is a saying from the Duke of Zhongli, which says, 'The king who can get his own army is a king, the king who can get his own friends is a hegemon, the king who can get his own allies is a king who can survive, and the king who plans for himself and no one else can match him is a king who will perish.' Now, with my lack of ability and none of my ministers being able to match me, our country is almost doomed. That's why I am worried." Duke Zhuang was worried, but King Wei was happy. King Wei hesitated and bowed twice, saying, "It is the divine messenger who has corrected my mistake. Thank you, Wuqi."

The moral of the story is that success can be both a blessing and a curse. While King Wei was happy because his plan was successful, he should have been worried because he was the only one who could come up with the plan. The story also highlights the importance of humility and the dangers of overconfidence.

In Western thought, the concepts in the story have a counterpart in the idea of the "hubris" or excessive pride, which can lead to downfall. The story also touches on the idea of the "wise man" who can see the dangers of hubris and the importance of humility. Additionally, the story highlights the importance of having a strong and capable team, as well as the dangers of relying solely on oneself.
