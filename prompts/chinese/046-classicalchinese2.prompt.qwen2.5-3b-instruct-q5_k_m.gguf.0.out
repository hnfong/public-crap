This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

### (1) Translation of the Story into English

魏武侯在谋划事情时非常成功，群臣没有人能超过他。一天退朝后，他脸上带着喜悦。吴起进言说：“我曾经听到过楚庄王说过的话。”魏武侯说：“楚庄王说过什么？”吴起回答说：“楚庄王在谋划事情时非常成功，群臣没有人能超过他，但退朝后却带着忧色。申公巫臣进言问道：‘您退朝后为什么带着忧色呢？’楚庄王回答说：‘我虽然不才，但群臣没有人能超过我，因此我感到忧心忡忡。我曾在中蘿（zhōng luó）的言论中说过：‘诸侯能自为得师者称王，能自为得友者称霸，能自为得疑者得以存，能自为谋而无人能及者则会灭亡。’如今，由于我的不才，群臣没有人能超过我，我们的国家几乎要灭亡了。因此我感到忧心忡忡。’楚庄王因为忧心忡忡，而您却因为喜悦。魏武侯恭敬地退后几步，再次拜谢说：‘这是上天让您提醒我犯下的错误。’”

### (2) Explanation of the Moral of the Story

The moral of this story is about the importance of humility and self-reflection. It highlights that even when one is successful, they should not become complacent and should remain aware of their own limitations. The story emphasizes that true wisdom and leadership come from recognizing one's own shortcomings and the potential dangers that can arise from overconfidence. It also underscores the value of seeking advice and being open to feedback, as it can prevent one from making fatal mistakes.

### (3) Does the Concepts in the Story Have a Counterpart in Western (European) Thought?

The concepts in this story are quite similar to those found in Western philosophical and political thought. For example:

- **Humility and Self-Reflection**: This is a common theme in Western philosophy, particularly in Stoicism and existentialism. Philosophers like Socrates, Aristotle, and later thinkers like Thomas Aquinas and Immanuel Kant have emphasized the importance of self-awareness and humility.
  
- **Caution Against Overconfidence**: This is also a recurring theme in Western political thought. For instance, Machiavelli in "The Prince" warns against the dangers of overconfidence and the importance of prudence and caution. Similarly, in modern political discourse, leaders are often advised to remain humble and cautious, recognizing that even the most successful leaders can make mistakes.

- **Seeking Advice and Feedback**: This is a principle that is widely recognized in Western political and leadership circles. The idea that leaders should be open to feedback and seek advice from others is a common practice in democratic and republican systems. This is reflected in the concept of "wise counsel" and the importance of a balanced and diverse advisory team.

In summary, the moral of the story aligns well with Western philosophical and political thought, emphasizing the importance of humility, self-reflection, and seeking advice. [end of text]
