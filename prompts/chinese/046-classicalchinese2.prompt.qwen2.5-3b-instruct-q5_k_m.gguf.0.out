### (1) Translation of the Story into English

Wei Wuhou was deliberating on matters and was successful, with no one in his court able to match his judgment. After the meeting, he had a happy expression. Wu Qi entered and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu?" Wei Wuhou replied, "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?" Wu Qi answered, "King Zhuang of Chu was successful in his deliberations, and no one in his court could match him. After the meeting, he had a worried expression. Shen Gong Wuchuan entered and asked, 'Why did King Zhuang of Chu have a worried expression?' King Zhuang of Chu said, 'I, the king, was successful in my deliberations, and no one in my court could match me. This is why I am worried. As for the words of King Zhuang of Chu, he said, 'If a vassal state can find a teacher who can teach them, it will become a king; if it can find friends who can help it, it will become a hegemon; if it can find someone who is not suspicious, it will survive; if it can find someone who is self-reliant and no one can match it, it will perish.' Now, with my lack of ability, and no one in my court able to match me, our country is almost in danger! This is why I am worried.' King Zhuang of Chu was worried, but you were happy. "Wei Wuhou hesitated, then bowed twice, saying, "The gods have sent you to correct my mistake."

### (2) Explanation of the Moral of the Story

The moral of this story is about the importance of humility and self-reflection. Wei Wuhou, despite his success, was initially happy about his achievements. However, upon hearing the words of King Zhuang of Chu, he realized that his success was not due to his own merit but rather due to the lack of competition from his court. This realization led him to feel worried, as he understood the precariousness of his position. The story emphasizes that true wisdom and success come from recognizing one's own limitations and the importance of being aware of potential threats to one's position. It also highlights the value of listening to and learning from others, even those who are more capable than oneself.

### (3) Does the Concepts in the Story Have a Counterpart in Western (European) Thought?

The concepts in this story, particularly the emphasis on humility, self-reflection, and the importance of recognizing one's own limitations, are not unique to Chinese thought but are also found in Western (European) philosophy. For example:

- **Humility and Self-Reflection**: Philosophers like Socrates and later philosophers such as Descartes and Kant have emphasized the importance of self-reflection and recognizing one's own limitations. Socrates famously said, "The unexamined life is not worth living," which is a similar sentiment to the reflection that Wei Wuhou experienced after hearing King Zhuang of Chu's words.

- **Recognition of Limitations**: The idea that one's success is not due to one's own merit but rather due to the lack of competition is a theme that can be found in Western thought. For instance, in the works of Thomas Hobbes, he discusses the social contract and the importance of recognizing the power of others, which can lead to a more balanced and stable society.

- **Importance of Learning from Others**: The story also highlights the value of learning from others, which is a concept that is central to Western philosophical traditions. For example, in the works of Plato, Socrates often engages in dialogues with others to gain insight and knowledge, reflecting a similar approach to learning from others.

In summary, the moral of the story is not unique to Chinese thought but is also found in Western philosophical traditions, emphasizing the importance of humility, self-reflection, and recognizing one's own limitations. [end of text]
