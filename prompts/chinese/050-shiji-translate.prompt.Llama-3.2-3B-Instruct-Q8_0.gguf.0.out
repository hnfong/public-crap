《The Biography of Zhang Jing and Feng Tang》

Zhang Jing, a man from Zhongyang, was a brother of Zhang Jun. He was appointed as a cavalry officer, serving under Emperor Xuan of Han, at the age of ten. He was not promoted again until he was twenty, and his name was not well-known. Zhang Jing said, "If I had been promoted earlier, my brother would not have been promoted." He wanted to resign. The middle-ranking official Yuan An knew of his abilities and was sorry to see him go, so he asked to transfer Zhang Jing to a different position. Zhang Jing was appointed as a court attendant, and he served well. When Emperor Xuan asked him about the history of the Qin and Han dynasties, Zhang Jing explained that the Qin lost its power and the Han gained it after a long time. The emperor praised him, and Zhang Jing was promoted to be a court attendant.

Zhang Jing accompanied the emperor on a journey, and the emperor asked him about the animals in the imperial menagerie. Zhang Jing was unable to answer, but the tiger keeper, Zhufu, answered correctly. The emperor was impressed and promoted Zhufu to be the imperial huntsman. The emperor asked Zhang Jing about the virtues of the Zhou and Eastern Wu states, and Zhang Jing said, "The Zhou and Eastern Wu are called 'long-lived' because they were able to endure for a long time." The emperor said, "That's true." Zhang Jing said, "If the Zhou and Eastern Wu were not able to endure, would they not be considered 'short-lived'?" The emperor replied, "That's not the case." Zhang Jing said, "The Zhou and Eastern Wu were able to endure because they were not arrogant and did not overstep their bounds. The emperor's power is not based on his words, but on his actions." The emperor agreed, and did not promote Zhufu.
