<think>Alright, I need to consider the text from 滑稽列传 and answer the questions concisely. Let me start by understanding the story. The text is about西门豹, who was the magistrate of邺 during the time of魏文侯. He asked the elders about the people's hardships, and they苦河伯娶妇, which caused poverty. The elders explained that三老 and廷每年都向百姓敛钱, using a small portion to娶妇 for河伯, and the rest they divided with祝巫. They would select a good-looking girl from a poor family, claim she was to be河伯's wife, and after洗沐 and斋戒, they would put her on a decorated raft, floating her on the河 until she sank. Families with good daughters feared the巫祝 would take their daughters, so they fled, leaving the city empty and poor.西门豹 said he would attend the next娶妇 ceremony.

When the time came,西门豹 went to the河上.三老,官属,豪长者,里父老, and thousands of people gathered. The巫 was an old woman of seventy, with ten弟子 dressed in单衣.西门豹 asked to see河伯's妇, and when the girl was brought, he said she wasn't good and asked大巫 to报河伯, promising to find a better girl later. He had吏卒抱大巫投河. After a while, he复弟子, then三老, all投河. He then wanted to send廷掾 and豪长者, who叩头破额,流血, and色死灰.西门豹 let them stay briefly, then said河伯留客久, and they should leave.从此,民不敢复言河伯娶妇.

西门豹 then发民凿十二渠引河水灌田,田皆溉.民治渠少烦苦,不欲, but豹 said民可以乐成,不可虑始, and百岁后父老子孙思我言.至今水利民富.十二渠驰道,汉立时,长吏欲合渠为一桥, but父老不肯,以为西门君所为不可更.长吏听之.西门豹名闻天下,泽流后世.

Now, let's answer the questions.

Q1: Short summary.西门豹治邺时,民苦河伯娶妇,敛钱多,用少娶妇,贫女远逃,城空.豹问故,至时会河上,称女不好,投大巫、弟子、三老入河,复欲使廷掾等,皆叩头破血.豹止,民惊恐,不敢复言.后发民凿十二渠灌田,田溉,民足富.虽治渠烦,百岁后子孙思其言.汉时长吏欲合渠,父老不听,以为贤君法不可更.豹名闻天下.

Q2: What kind of women were victims? The text says "小家女好者" from poor families, good-looking, feared by families, so they were poor, good-looking girls.

Q3: Who benefited? The elders said三老,廷掾常赋敛,用部分为河伯娶妇,与祝巫共分其余. So三老,廷掾,祝巫 benefited from the money.

Q4: Did protagonist use wits or force? He used wits. He pretended to不满意女, asked大巫报河伯, then复弟子,三老, all投河.复欲使廷掾,豪长者, they pleaded. He didn't use force directly; he used their superstition and fear to make them stop. So wits, not force.

Q5: Was it moral? From various perspectives: Traditional morality might say it's immoral to kill people, even if they are corrupt. But from utilitarian view, it saved many girls and ended poverty,民足富. The text says豹 said民 can乐成,不可虑始, and百岁后父老子孙思我言. So it was for the greater good. Also, the corrupt ones were killed, which might be seen as justice. But killing without trial might be immoral. However, in context, it was effective and ended the suffering.

Q6: Explain the quote:子產治鄭,民不能欺;子賤治單父,民不忍欺;西门豹治邺,民不敢欺. Who is most贤? The quote means子產治郑,民不能欺 because he was so wise and民 couldn't deceive him.子贱治单父,民不忍欺 because he was so virtuous,民不忍 deceive him.西门豹治邺,民不敢欺 because he was strict,民 afraid to deceive. The question is who is most贤. The text says辨治者能别之. The comment in the text says西门豹名闻天下,泽流后世,几可谓非贤大夫哉? So it implies西门豹 is贤. But comparing:子产 might be most贤 because民不能欺, implying he was so effective,民 couldn't deceive.子贱民不忍欺, implying he was so kind,民不忍.西门豹民不敢欺, implying he was strict,民 afraid. The text doesn't say who is best, but the ending praises西门豹 as贤. So the comment is fair because西门豹's治法 led to lasting benefits,民富, and his法不可更, so he was贤.</think>### Q1: Summary (5 points)  
西门豹治邺时,民苦于河伯娶妇,导致贫女逃亡、城空田荒.豹问故,知三老、廷掾、巫祝敛钱分财,以贫女浮河献祭.豹伪称送女,会河上,以女不好为由,先后投大巫、弟子、三老入河,复欲使廷掾等趣之,皆叩头破血.豹止,民惊恐,不敢复言.后发民凿十二渠引河灌田,田皆溉,民足富.虽治渠烦苦,百岁后父老子孙思其言.汉立时,长吏欲合渠为一桥,父老不听,以为贤君法不可更.豹名闻天下,泽流后世.

### Q2: Victims (2 points)  
Usually poor, good-looking girls from humble families ("小家女好者").

### Q3: Beneficiaries (2 points)  
三老、廷掾、祝巫 (local elders, officials, and shamans) shared the敛钱, using only a portion for the ritual.

### Q4: Wits or Force? (5 points)  
**Wits**.西门豹 pretended to不满意女, demanded巫祝入报河伯, then复投弟子、三老入河, and threatened廷掾等. He used their fear of superstition to expose the fraud, making民惊恐 and不敢复言, without direct force.

### Q5: Morality (10 points)  
- **Utilitarian perspective**: Moral, as it ended suffering, saved girls, and brought prosperity (民田皆溉,民人以给足富).  
- **Traditional justice**: Immoral, as killing without trial violates ethics, but it targeted corrupt exploiters.  
- **Confucian view**: Moral, as豹民可以乐成,不可虑始, prioritizing long-term benefit over short-term hardship.  
- **Overall**: Justified by effectiveness and lasting benefit, though method was extreme.

### Q6: Explanation and Fairness (15 points)  
**Meaning**:  
- 子产治郑,民不能欺:子产 was so wise that民 could not deceive him.  
- 子贱治单父,民不忍欺:子贱 was so virtuous that民不忍 deceive him.  
- 西门豹治邺,民不敢欺:西门豹 was so strict that民 afraid to deceive him.  
The quote compares three leaders' abilities:子产 (incapable of deception),子贱 (不忍,不忍),西门豹 (不敢, fear).  

**Fairness**:  
- **Fair**: The comment praises西门豹 as贤大夫, noting his法闻天下,泽流后世, and民足富. His治法 (strictness + wits) led to民不敢欺, lasting impact, and父老不听长吏, showing his法式不可更.  
- **Unfair**:子产 and子贱 may be more "贤" (子产:民不能欺, implying superior governance;子贱:民不忍欺, implying moral influence).西门豹 relied on fear, not moral persuasion.  
- **Conclusion**: Fair in context, as豹's治法 was effective and beneficial, but子产 might be most贤 for民不能欺.辨治者能别之:治法 depends on context. [end of text]
