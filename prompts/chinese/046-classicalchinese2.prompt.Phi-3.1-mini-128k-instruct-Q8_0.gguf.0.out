 (1) Translation:

The statesman Wu Wu of Wei plotted and succeeded, but his subordinates could not capture him, and he left the throne with a smile. The general Wu Qi said, "Have you ever heard the words of the Chu Zhuang King, which I heard on both sides?" Wu Wu replied, "What are the words of the Chu Zhuang King?" Wu Qi answered, "The Chu Zhuang King plotted and succeeded, but his subordinates could not capture him, and he left the throne with worry. He said, 'When a kingdom has worry, it means that the ruler does not plan well and cannot be like his subjects. When a ruler plans well and cannot be like his subjects, it means that the kingdom will be in danger.' Today, because the ruler does not plan well and cannot be like his subjects, his subordinates cannot capture him, and our country is in danger! That is why there is worry.' The Chu Zhuang King planned with worry, while the ruler planned with joy.

(2) Moral of the story:

The moral of the story is that a ruler should plan carefully and be like his subjects in order to maintain stability and avoid worry. If a ruler does not plan well and cannot be like his subjects, it will lead to the downfall of the kingdom.

(3) Counterpart in Western (European) thought:

The concepts in the story have a counterpart in Western thought, particularly in the idea of the "divine right of kings" and the importance of good governance. In Western thought, the divine right of kings was a political and religious doctrine that asserted that a monarch was subject to no earthly authority, deriving the right to rule directly from the will of God. This idea was prevalent in Europe during the Middle Ages and the early modern period.

In terms of good governance, the story emphasizes the importance of a ruler being like his subjects and planning well for the kingdom's stability. This idea is reflected in the Western concept of the social contract, which suggests that a ruler's authority comes from the consent of the governed, and that the ruler has a responsibility to govern in the best interests of the people. The story also highlights the importance of wise and capable leadership, which is a common theme in Western political thought. [end of text]
