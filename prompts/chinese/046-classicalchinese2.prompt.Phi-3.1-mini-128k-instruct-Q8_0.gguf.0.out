This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

(1) Translation:

The Duke of Wen devised a plot and succeeded, but his ministers could not capture him. He abdicated the throne with a smile. The Duke of Wu said: "Have you ever heard a saying from the King of Chu about the Wuzhuu (the King of Chu) plotting and succeeding, and his ministers unable to capture him, and him abdicating with worry?" The Duke of Wen replied: "What is the saying of the King of Chu?" The Duke of Wu responded: "The King of Chu said: 'The Wuzhuu planned and succeeded, but his ministers could not capture him. This is why he worried. His saying goes: 'The ruler who does not plan and succeeds, but his ministers capture him, is not a ruler. The ruler who does not plan and succeeds, but his ministers cannot capture him, is a ruler. The ruler who plans and succeeds, but his ministers capture him, is not a ruler. The ruler who plans and succeeds, but his ministers cannot capture him, is a ruler.' This is why he worried. His saying goes: 'The ruler who does not plan and succeeds, but his ministers capture him, is not a ruler. The ruler who does not plan and succeeds, but his ministers cannot capture him, is a ruler. The ruler who plans and succeeds, but his ministers capture him, is not a ruler. The ruler who plans and succeeds, but his ministers cannot capture him, is a ruler.' This is why he worried.' The Duke of Wen said: 'The King of Chu worried, but the Duke of Wu was happy.' The Duke of Wen then went on his inspection tours again, saying: 'The Master of the Divine Strategies moves the people's affairs.'

(2) Moral of the story:

The moral of the story is that a wise and successful ruler is one who plans well and achieves their goals, while a ruler who fails to plan and succeeds is not truly a ruler. Conversely, a ruler who plans and succeeds but is unable to maintain control over their ministers is also not a true ruler. The story emphasizes the importance of strategic planning, success, and the ability to maintain power and control as the hallmarks of a great ruler.

(3) Counterpart in Western (European) thought:

The concepts in the story have counterparts in Western thought, particularly in the realms of political philosophy and leadership. The idea that a ruler must plan and succeed to be considered a true ruler is echoed in the works of Western philosophers such as Niccolò Machiavelli, who in his book "The Prince" discusses the importance of strategic planning and the ability to maintain power. Machiavelli argues that a ruler must be willing to use cunning and deceit if necessary to maintain control and achieve their goals. Similarly, the idea that a ruler who plans and succeeds but cannot maintain control over their ministers is not a true ruler is also reflected in Western thought, as the ability to maintain power and control is seen as a key aspect of effective leadership. The story also touches on the idea that a ruler who does not plan and succeeds but is still able to maintain control over their ministers is a true ruler, which is a concept that can be found in various forms in Western political philosophy. Overall, the story's emphasis on strategic planning, success, and the ability to maintain power and control aligns with many of the key themes found in Western political thought.<|im_end|>
