Q1: Summary: The story is about a local official named Ximen Bao who, upon discovering a superstitious practice of sacrificing girls to the river god to prevent flooding, cleverly exposes the corruption behind it and stops the practice, thus benefiting the local people.

Q2: The victims were usually young, beautiful girls from poor families.

Q3: The beneficiaries were the local officials, the witch, and the shamans who profited from the extortion of the people.

Q4: Ximen Bao used a combination of wits and force. He pretended to follow the tradition but cleverly exposed the corruption and punished the corrupt officials and shamans by throwing them into the river, thus ending the practice.

Q5: From a moral perspective, Ximen Bao's actions can be seen as justified because he stopped a harmful practice and benefited the people. However, from a legal perspective, his actions could be seen as excessive and violent. From a utilitarian perspective, his actions were justified as they led to a greater good for the majority.

Q6: The quote means that the three officials - Zi Chan, Zi Jian, and Ximen Bao - were all capable, but their methods differed. Zi Chan's governance was so just that people could not deceive him, Zi Jian's was so benevolent that people felt不忍心to deceive him, and Ximen Bao's was so strict that people dared not deceive him. The comment is fair as it recognizes the different strengths of each official and suggests that a good ruler should be able to discern the best approach for their situation. However, it also implies that strictness and fear may not be the most effective long-term solution for governance. 

The comment is fair in that it acknowledges the different approaches and their effectiveness, but it also highlights the complexity of governance and the need for a nuanced understanding of different leadership styles. It suggests that while strictness can be effective, it may not be the most sustainable or benevolent approach. 

The comment is also fair in that it recognizes the importance of the context and the specific challenges faced by each official, rather than simply ranking them based on a single criterion. It encourages a more holistic evaluation of leadership qualities and their impact on governance. 

However, the comment could be seen as somewhat biased towards a more benevolent and less strict approach to governance, as it implies that the inability to deceive is a higher form of governance than the fear of being deceived. This could be seen as a reflection of the commentator's personal values and preferences. 

Overall, the comment is fair in its recognition of the complexity of governance and the need for a nuanced understanding of different leadership styles, but it also reflects a certain bias towards benevolent governance.
