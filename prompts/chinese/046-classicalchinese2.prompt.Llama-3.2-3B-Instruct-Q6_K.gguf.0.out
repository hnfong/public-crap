This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

Here is the translation of the passage:

 Wei Wu Wang was cautious and wise in his governance, and no one could match him. He retired from office and was filled with joy. Wu Qi asked, "Have you ever heard the words of the former King Zhou of Chu?" Wei Wu Wang replied, "What were the words of King Zhou of Chu?" Wu Qi said, "King Zhou was cautious and wise in his governance, and no one could match him. When he retired from office, he was filled with worry. Shang Yang asked him, 'King Zhou, you are worried about something. What is it?' King Zhou said, 'I am worried because I did not cultivate wisdom and no one can match me. It is because of my own lack of insight that I am worried. I used to say, "The ruler who has a strong army will conquer, the ruler who has a good friend will dominate, the ruler who has a good advisor will be safe, and the ruler who does not have a good advisor will be destroyed." Now, I am worried because I did not cultivate wisdom, and no one can match me, and my country is almost lost! That is why I am worried.' King Zhou was worried, and you are filled with joy.' Wu Qi said, 'King Zhou was worried because he did not cultivate wisdom, and no one can match him, and his country is almost lost!' Wei Wu Wang bowed twice and said, 'You are correcting me, sir.'"

(1)

The story is about Wei Wu Wang, a wise and cautious leader, who is concerned about the state of his country because he believes that he has not cultivated wisdom and no one can match him. He recalls the words of the former King Zhou of Chu, who was also worried about the same issue. Wu Qi, a loyal servant, points out the irony that King Zhou's words are now being applied to Wei Wu Wang's situation, and that his country is almost lost.

(2)

The moral of the story is that true wisdom and leadership require continuous effort and self-reflection. It is not enough to rely on past achievements or reputation, but rather to continually cultivate wisdom and adapt to changing circumstances. The story highlights the importance of humility and recognizing one's own limitations.

(3)

The concepts in the story have counterparts in Western thought, particularly in the ideas of ancient Greek philosophers such as Socrates and Aristotle. The idea of the importance of wisdom and self-reflection is a central theme in Western philosophy, particularly in the concept of "phronesis" (practical wisdom) in Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. The idea that true wisdom requires continuous effort and self-awareness is also reflected in the concept of "eudaimonia" (human flourishing) in Aristotle's philosophy.

Additionally, the story echoes the idea of the " hubris" (excessive pride) and the "tragic flaw" (hamartia) in Western tragedy, where a character's downfall is often caused by their own arrogance and failure to recognize their own limitations. The story of King Zhou's downfall is a classic example of this concept, and Wu Qi's words can be seen as a commentary on the dangers of hubris and the importance of humility. [end of text]
