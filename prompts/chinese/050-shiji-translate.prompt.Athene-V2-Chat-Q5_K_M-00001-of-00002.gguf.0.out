《張釋之馮唐列傳》

Zhang Tingwei Shìzhī was from Duyang, and his courtesy name was Ji. He had an elder brother named Zhong who lived with him. He became a cavalry officer through his wealth and served Emperor Xiaowen for ten years without promotion, remaining unknown. Shìzhī said, “Serving for a long time has depleted Zhong’s wealth, and I have not succeeded.” He wanted to resign and return home. The Middle Attendant General Yuan Ang knew of his virtue and was sorry to see him leave, so he requested that Shìzhī be transferred to serve as a receptionist. After Shìzhī had completed his audience, he stepped forward to discuss matters of state. Emperor Xiaowen said, “Lower your tone; do not speak too highly. Make your suggestions practical and implementable.” Thus, Shìzhī spoke about the affairs between the Qin and Han dynasties, explaining why the Qin had failed and the Han had succeeded. Emperor Xiaowen praised him and appointed him as the Chief Receptionist.

Shìzhī accompanied the emperor to the tiger enclosure. The emperor asked the chief warden of the Shanglin Park about the records of various animals. After more than ten questions, the warden looked around and could not answer. A low-ranking official from the tiger enclosure answered the emperor’s questions about the animal records in great detail, trying to show his quick and eloquent responses. The emperor said, “Should officials not be like this? The warden is unreliable!” He then ordered Shìzhī to appoint the low-ranking official as the chief warden of Shanglin Park. Shìzhī stepped forward after a while and said, “Your Majesty, what do you think of Marquis Zhou Bo of Jiang?” The emperor replied, “He is a man of integrity.” Shìzhī asked again, “What about Marquis Zhang Xiangru of Dongyang?” The emperor again replied, “He is a man of integrity.” Shìzhī said, “Marquis Zhou Bo and Marquis Zhang Xiangru are called men of integrity, yet these two men find it difficult to express themselves. How can they be compared to this low-ranking official who speaks fluently and quickly? Moreover, the Qin dynasty relied on clerks who competed in speed and strictness, but their flaws were merely superficial, lacking genuine compassion. Therefore, their faults were not heard, and they declined until the second generation, leading to the collapse of the empire. Now, if Your Majesty promotes this low-ranking official based on his eloquence, I fear that the whole world will follow suit, competing in eloquence without substance. The influence of the ruler on the people is as swift as a shadow or an echo, so Your Majesty must be cautious in your actions.” The emperor said, “Well said.” He then decided not to appoint the low-ranking official.

The emperor got into his carriage and summoned Shìzhī to ride with him. They moved slowly, and the emperor asked Shìzhī about the flaws of the Qin dynasty. Shìzhī spoke frankly. Upon reaching the palace, the emperor appointed Shìzhī as the Chief of the Imperial Chariots.

Not long after, the Crown Prince and the King of Liang entered the palace together in a carriage and did not dismount at the Sima Gate. Shìzhī stopped them from entering the palace and impeached them for disrespect for not dismounting at the public gate. Empress Dowager Bo heard of this, and Emperor Xiaowen removed his hat and apologized, saying, “I have not disciplined my children well.” Empress Dowager Bo then sent an envoy to pardon the Crown Prince and the King of Liang, allowing them to enter. Emperor Xiaowen was impressed by Shìzhī and appointed him as a Middle Doctor.

Not long after, Shìzhī was promoted to Middle Attendant General. He accompanied the emperor to Baling and stood to the north of a toilet. At that time, Lady Shen was present, and the emperor pointed out the road to Xinfeng to her, saying, “This is the road to Handan.” He asked Lady Shen to play the zither, and the emperor sang along, feeling sad and melancholic. He then said to his ministers, “Alas! If the coffin were made of stone from the northern mountain, lined with hemp and silk, and sealed with lacquer, could it be moved?” Everyone said, “Well said.” Shìzhī stepped forward and said, “If there is something desirable inside, even if the mountain is sealed, there will still be gaps. If there is nothing desirable inside, even without a stone coffin, why should one worry?” The emperor praised him. Later, Shìzhī was appointed as the Chief Justice.

Not long after, the emperor was traveling on the Zhongwei Bridge when a man ran out from under the bridge, startling the imperial horse. The emperor ordered the cavalry to capture the man and hand him over to the Chief Justice. Shìzhī questioned the man, who said, “I am from the county. I heard the imperial procession was coming and hid under the bridge. After a long time, I thought it had passed, so I came out and saw the imperial carriage, and I ran.” The Chief Justice determined that the man had violated the imperial procession and should be fined. The emperor was angry and said, “This man startled my horse. My horse is gentle, but if it were another horse, wouldn’t it have injured me? And the Chief Justice only fines him?” Shìzhī replied, “The law is what the Son of Heaven shares with the people. If the law is changed to be more severe, the people will no longer trust it. At the time, if the emperor had ordered him to be executed on the spot, it would have been fine. Now that the case has been handed over to the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice is the balance of justice for the whole country. If this case is handled unfairly, it will affect the application of the law throughout the country, leaving the people unsure of how to act. Please consider this, Your Majesty.” After a long time, the emperor said, “The Chief Justice’s judgment is correct.”

Later, someone stole a jade ring from the altar of the Gao Temple. The thief was captured, and the emperor was angry and ordered the Chief Justice to handle the case. Shìzhī examined the law and reported that the thief should be executed in the marketplace. The emperor was furious and said, “How can a person be so lawless as to steal from the temple of the previous emperor? I entrusted the case to the Chief Justice because I wanted the thief to be exterminated, but you only report the legal sentence. This is not how I intend to honor the temple.” Shìzhī removed his hat and bowed, saying, “The law as it stands is sufficient. Moreover, crimes are graded by severity. If stealing from the temple results in extermination, what would happen if a commoner took a handful of soil from Changling? How would Your Majesty increase the punishment?” After a long time, the emperor discussed the matter with Empress Dowager Bo and agreed with the Chief Justice’s judgment. At this time, the Middle Warden Zhou Yafu and the Chancellor of Liang, Wang Tiankai, saw that Shìzhī’s arguments were fair and became his friends. Zhang Tingwei thus gained a good reputation throughout the country.

After Emperor Xiaowen died and Emperor Jing ascended the throne, Shìzhī was afraid and claimed illness. He wanted to resign but feared severe punishment. He wanted to apologize but was unsure how. Following the advice of Wang Sheng, he eventually apologized, and Emperor Jing did not punish him.

Wang Sheng was skilled in the teachings of Huang-Lao and was a hermit. He was once summoned to the court, where the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers were all present. Wang Sheng, an old man, said, “My sock has come loose,” and turned to Zhang Tingwei, saying, “Tie my sock for me!” Shìzhī knelt and tied it. Afterward, someone asked Wang Sheng, “Why did you humiliate Zhang Tingwei in court by making him tie your sock?” Wang Sheng replied, “I am old and of low status, and I know I cannot benefit Zhang Tingwei. Zhang Tingwei is a renowned minister of the country, so I humiliated him to make him more respected.” The officials heard this and admired Wang Sheng and respected Zhang Tingwei.

Zhang Tingwei served Emperor Jing for more than a year and became the Chancellor of Huainan, still bearing a grudge from the past. After a long time, Shìzhī died. His son, Zhang Zhi, whose courtesy name was Changgong, became a high-ranking official but was dismissed. Because he could not adapt to the world, he never held office again.

Feng Tang’s great-grandfather was from Zhao. His father moved to Dai. When the Han dynasty was established, they moved to Anling. Feng Tang was known for his filial piety and served as the head of the Middle Attendant Office under Emperor Xiaowen. When the emperor’s carriage passed by, he asked Tang, “Why are you an attendant? Where is your home?” Tang answered truthfully. The emperor said, “When I was in Dai, my food supervisor Gao Qu often spoke to me about the virtues of General Li Qi, who fought at Julu. Now, every time I eat, I think of Julu. Do you know about this?” Tang replied, “Even Li Qi is not as good as Lian Po and Li Mu.” The emperor asked, “Why?” Tang said, “My great-grandfather served in Zhao and was a general, and he knew Li Mu well. My father was a chancellor in Dai and knew General Li Qi, so he knew his character.” The emperor, having heard about Lian Po and Li Mu, was pleased and slapped his thigh, saying, “Alas! If only I could have Lian Po and Li Mu as my generals, I would not worry about the Xiongnu!” Tang said, “Your Majesty! Even if you had Lian Po and Li Mu, you could not use them.” The emperor was angry and left for the inner palace. After a long time, he summoned Tang and scolded him, saying, “Why did you humiliate me in public? Couldn’t you have spoken privately?” Tang apologized, saying, “I am a simple man and do not know how to avoid taboos.”

At that time, the Xiongnu had recently invaded Chaona and killed the governor of Beidi, Ang. The emperor was concerned about the Xiongnu and asked Tang again, “Why do you think I cannot use Lian Po and Li Mu?” Tang replied, “I have heard that in ancient times, when a king appointed a general, he would kneel and push the chariot, saying, ‘Within the gate, I control; beyond the gate, the general controls.’ All military achievements and rewards were decided by the general and reported upon return. This is not just empty talk. My great-grandfather said that when Li Mu was a general in Zhao, he used the market taxes to feed his soldiers, and all rewards and punishments were decided by him without interference from the center. He was entrusted with responsibility and held accountable for success, so Li Mu could fully utilize his intelligence and abilities. He led 1,300 chariots, 13,000 cavalry, and 100,000 elite soldiers, driving the Xiongnu north, defeating the Donghu, destroying the Danlin, suppressing the powerful Qin to the west, and supporting Han and Wei to the south. At that time, Zhao was almost a hegemon. Later, when King Qian of Zhao ascended the throne, his mother was a courtesan. King Qian used the slander of Guo Kai to execute Li Mu and replaced him with Yan Ju. This led to the defeat of the army and the capture and destruction by Qin. Now, I have heard that Wei Shang, the governor of Yunzhong, used all the market taxes to feed his soldiers and spent his own money to provide for them, slaughtering oxen every five days to entertain guests, officers, and aides. This made the Xiongnu avoid Yunzhong and stay away from the border. When the Xiongnu once invaded, Wei Shang led his chariots and cavalry to attack them, killing many. The soldiers were all from families and had joined the army from the fields. They did not know the military regulations. After a day of fighting, they would cut off heads and capture prisoners, report their achievements to the commandery, and if one word was wrong, the clerks would punish them according to the law. Their rewards were not given, but the clerks strictly enforced the law. I am foolish, but I think Your Majesty’s laws are too strict, the rewards too light, and the punishments too severe. Moreover, Wei Shang was demoted for a discrepancy of six heads in his report, and Your Majesty handed him over to the clerks, stripped him of his rank, and punished him. From this, even if Your Majesty had Lian Po and Li Mu, you could not use them. I am indeed foolish and have offended taboos, deserving death, deserving death!” The emperor was pleased. On that day, he ordered Feng Tang to hold the imperial seal and pardon Wei Shang, restoring him as the governor of Yunzhong, and appointed Tang as the Commander of the Chariots and Cavalry, overseeing the Middle Warden and the chariots and cavalry of the commanderies and states.

In the seventh year, Emperor Jing ascended the throne and appointed Tang as the Chancellor of Chu, but he was later dismissed. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne, he sought virtuous men, and Feng Tang was recommended. At that time, Tang was over ninety years old and could no longer serve, so his son Feng Sui was appointed as an attendant. Sui’s courtesy name was Wangsun, and he was also an extraordinary man who was friendly with me.

The Grand Historian said: Zhang Ji’s words about men of integrity, adhering to the law without bending to favor; Feng Gong’s discussion of generals, how insightful! How insightful! It is said, “If you do not know a person, look at his friends.” The praise of these two men can be inscribed in the temple. The Book says, “Without bias or favoritism, the king’s way is broad; without favoritism or bias, the king’s way is smooth.” Zhang Ji and Feng Gong are close to this ideal. [end of text]
