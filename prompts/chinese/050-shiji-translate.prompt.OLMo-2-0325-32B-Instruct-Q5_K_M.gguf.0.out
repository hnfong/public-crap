"The Biography of Feng Tang, Who Served Emperor Tang of the Qin Dynasty"

Zhang Jing, styled Ji, was from Du Yang. He had an elder brother, Zhong, and they lived together. Zhang Jing served as a cavalry attendant and worked under Emperor Xiaowen. For ten years, he was not promoted and remained unknown. Zhang Jing said, "Having served in the bureaucracy for a long time has depleted my brother's wealth, and it is not satisfactory." He wished to resign and return home. When Zhang Jing finished his morning duties at court, he took the opportunity to discuss practical matters. Emperor Wen said, "You are humble, do not speak too loftily, what you suggest can be immediately implemented." Then Zhang Jing talked about the events between the Qin and Han dynasties, how the Qin lost and the Han gained power, and the emperor praised him. Zhang Jing was then appointed as an attendant cavalier messenger.

Zhang Jing, while accompanying the emperor, climbed the tiger hunting grounds. The emperor asked the Chief of the Royal Park about various birds and beasts, and the Chief, flustered, could not answer the ten or so questions. A subordinate, standing by, answered the questions about the bird and beast records very thoroughly, impressing the emperor who wanted to see if he could respond fluently without end. Emperor Wen said, "Is this how officials should be? I cannot rely on this!" He then ordered Zhang Jing to be appointed as the Chief of the Royal Park.

After some time, before the emperor, Zhang Jing questioned the emperor about the reputations of Jing Hou Zhao Bao and Dongyang Hou Zhang Xiang. The emperor replied that they were both elderly. Zhang Jing said, "Both Jing Hou and Dongyang Hou are called elders, but they could not even express their thoughts, how can they compare to the sharpness of this subordinate? Moreover, the Qin dynasty promoted officials who were adept with pen and brush, and officials competed with each other in diligence and scrutiny, but their tools were merely superficial. Therefore, they were not aware of their own faults, and their negligence led to the collapse of the dynasty over two generations. Now, Your Majesty promotes this eloquent subordinate, and I fear that the people will follow suit, valuing eloquence over substance. Furthermore, the emperor's behavior influences the ministers, and minor mistakes cannot be ignored." The emperor agreed and did not promote the eloquent subordinate.


The emperor was in his carriage and called Zhang Jing to share the ride. They traveled slowly, and the emperor asked Zhang Jing about the events during the Qin dynasty. Zhang Jing spoke about the rise and fall of the Qin and Han dynasties. The emperor praised him and appointed Zhang Jing as the Chief of the Imperial Carriage Department.


Soon after, the Crown Prince and Prince of Liang rode together into court without dismounting at the gate of the Commander-in-chief's residence. Zhang Jing stopped the Crown Prince and Prince of Liang from entering the palace. He reported their disrespect and they were demoted. Empress Dowager Bo, after hearing about the incident, the emperor apologized and dismissed the demotion, and allowed the Crown Prince and Prince of Liang to enter. The emperor appreciated Zhang Jing and promoted him to Chamberlain Gentleman.


Later, Zhang Jing rose to the position of Central Commandant. He once discussed with the emperor about the events at the Ba Ling tomb, and the emperor praised him. Zhang Jing later became the Director of the Imperial Carriage Department.


One day, a man sneaked into the palace, and Zhang Jing stopped him. The emperor, after hearing the incident, commended Zhang Jing. Later, Zhang Jing discussed with the emperor about the loss of Qin's strict laws, and the emperor praised him. Zhang Jing suggested that if there were desirable people, even if there were none, one should not rely on strict laws. The emperor agreed.


Later, a thief stole a jade ring from the imperial palace, Zhang Jing caught the thief and reported to the emperor, the emperor was angry and wanted to punish the thief harshly. Zhang Jing argued that the laws were too strict and the emperor agreed.


Later, Zhang Jing was promoted to the position of Minister of Justice. After Emperor Wen's death, Zhang Jing was promoted to Central Great Officer. After Emperor Jing's reign, Zhang Jing was promoted to Minister of Justice. Later, Zhang Jing died.
