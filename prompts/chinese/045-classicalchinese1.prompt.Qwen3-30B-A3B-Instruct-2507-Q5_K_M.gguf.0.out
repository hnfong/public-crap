**Q1: Summary (5 points)**  
Wen Hou of Wei sent Ximen Bao to govern Ye, where he discovered a corrupt tradition: local officials and shamans exploited fear of the river god (Hebo) to extort money by sacrificing young girls. Ximen Bao exposed the fraud by pretending to send the "bride" to Hebo, then drowned the corrupt巫 (shamans) and officials one by one, terrifying the people into abandoning the practice. He later built twelve canals to irrigate farmland, bringing lasting prosperity. His wisdom and courage earned him lasting fame.

**Q2: Victims (2 points)**  
Young, beautiful girls from poor families were usually chosen as victims.

**Q3: Beneficiaries (2 points)**  
The three elders, magistrates, shamans (巫), and their assistants benefited by collecting taxes, keeping most of the money, and using the ritual to maintain power and enrich themselves.

**Q4: Use of wits or force? (5 points)**  
Ximen Bao used **wits**. He pretended to follow the ritual, using formal ceremony to gain trust. By feigning respect for tradition, he turned the ritual against the corrupt officials. His staged "sending" of the bride allowed him to justify drowning the shamans and officials under the guise of divine protocol. The psychological pressure and fear he induced were strategic, not brute force. He manipulated belief systems to dismantle corruption.

**Q5: Moral evaluation (10 points)**  
- **Pro:** The act was morally justified—ending a cruel, exploitative system that harmed innocent girls and impoverished the people. The shamans were frauds; their "religion" was a tool of oppression. Ximen Bao saved lives and restored justice.
- **Con:** Drowning people—even corrupt ones—violates moral and legal principles. The use of violence, even symbolic, risks setting a dangerous precedent.
- **Legal/Pragmatic:** In a society where superstition ruled, force was necessary to break entrenched power. His actions were a necessary evil to achieve long-term good.
- **Religious:** Some might argue he defied divine order, but since the "god" was a human construct, his actions were not sacrilegious.
- **Ethical:** While the means were harsh, the ends were just—protecting the vulnerable and promoting public welfare.

Overall, most ethical frameworks would support his actions as morally defensible given the context.

**Q6: Explanation and fairness of the comment (15 points)**  
The quote praises three officials: Zichan (Zheng), Zijian (Shandu), and Ximen Bao. Each governed differently:  
- Zichan: **Could not be deceived**—wise, perceptive, ruled with intelligence.  
- Zijian: **Could not be betrayed**—governed with virtue, inspired loyalty and affection.  
- Ximen Bao: **Could not be deceived**—governed with fear, using authority and fear to enforce justice.

The comment implies that while all were effective, their methods differed: Zichan’s wisdom, Zijian’s virtue, Ximen Bao’s firmness. The ranking is **fair** in context:  
- Ximen Bao’s method was effective but harsh—fear-based rule, not love.  
- Zijian’s method (emotional connection) is often seen as higher virtue.  
- Zichan’s balance of wisdom and justice is highly respected.

However, the comment may slightly undervalue Ximen Bao’s **practical success**—he transformed a corrupt society and brought lasting benefits. His "fear" was not tyranny but a necessary response to deep-rooted fraud. Thus, while Zijian’s virtue is noble, Ximen Bao’s achievement in reforming a broken system deserves equal or greater recognition. The comment is fair in ranking virtue, but **less fair in assessing real-world impact**. Ximen Bao’s legacy—lasting irrigation, public welfare—shows he was not just a "fear" ruler, but a transformative leader. [end of text]
