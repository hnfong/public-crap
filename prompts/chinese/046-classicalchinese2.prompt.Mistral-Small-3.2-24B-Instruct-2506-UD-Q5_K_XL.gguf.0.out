(1) Translation:

The story is about Wei Wu Hou, a ruler, who was making decisions that were correct, and his ministers could not match his wisdom. After court, he had a happy expression. Wu Qi, a minister, approached him and said, "Have you ever heard the words of Chu Zhang Wang from your attendants?" Wei Wu Hou asked, "What did Chu Zhang Wang say?" Wu Qi replied, "Chu Zhang Wang made decisions that were correct, and his ministers could not match his wisdom. After court, he had a worried expression. Shen Gong Yu Qin asked, 'Your Majesty has a worried expression after court, why is that?' Chu Zhang Wang said, 'I made decisions that were correct, and my ministers could not match my wisdom, that is why I am worried. There is a saying, 'When lords consider themselves to have a teacher, they become kings; when they have a friend, they become hegemons; when they have doubts, they survive; when they consider themselves wiser than others, they perish.' Now, with my unworthiness, and my ministers unable to match me, is our country close to perishing! That is why I am worried.' Chu Zhang Wang was worried, but you are happy." Wei Wu Hou, after hearing this, bowed twice and said, "Heaven has sent you to correct my mistakes."

(2) Moral of the story:

The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should be concerned when his ministers cannot match his wisdom. This is because it indicates a lack of competent advice and support, which could lead to poor decision-making and ultimately the downfall of the state. The story emphasizes the importance of humility and the value of having wise and competent advisors.

(3) Counterpart in Western thought:

In Western thought, there are several concepts that align with the moral of this story. One is the idea of "the wisdom of crowds" or "collective intelligence," which suggests that groups of people are often better at solving problems and making decisions than individuals, even if those individuals are highly intelligent or experienced. This is because diverse groups bring different perspectives and information to the table, leading to more robust and creative solutions.

Another related concept is the "foolish ruler" or "tyrant" archetype in Greek philosophy and literature. For instance, Plato's "Republic" discusses the dangers of a ruler who is not wise or virtuous, and how such a ruler can lead a state to ruin. Similarly, in Shakespeare's plays, such as "Julius Caesar" and "Coriolanus," the consequences of a ruler's arrogance and inability to heed good advice are explored.

Additionally, the importance of having wise advisors is a common theme in Western thought. For example, in the Bible, there are numerous examples of kings who either prospered or perished based on whether they heeded the advice of their wise counselors. In secular Western literature, the role of advisors and the dangers of ignoring their counsel are also recurring themes. [end of text]
