Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They want me to translate a passage from the Zhuangzi (though actually it's from the Hanzi, which might be a different text—wait, the user mentioned 荀子, which is "Xunzi," the works of Xun Zi, the Confucian philosopher. So I need to check that first. The passage provided is about Wei Wu侯, which is a character from the Warring States period, likely a historical figure. The story involves him consulting with臣子, and Fü Ch'i (or Wu Zi) pointing out a parallel to楚庄王's situation. 

First, I need to accurately translate the Chinese text into English while keeping proper names in Chinese. The user specified that, so names like 魏武侯, 吳起, 楚莊王 should stay as they are. Then, the moral of the story. The key elements here are the king's effective decision-making, his reaction (first喜色, then upon realizing the problem, he's worried), and the advice from Fü Ch'i. The main point seems to be about self-awareness, realizing one's limitations even when successful, and the importance of seeking advice. 

For the moral, it's likely about the dangers of overconfidence or the importance of humility. The quote from 楚庄王 mentions that if you can't find a teacher, a friend, or a doubter, you might be in trouble. So the moral could be about the need for different types of advisors and self-reflection.

Third question: Do these concepts have counterparts in Western thought? The idea of needing different perspectives (teacher, friend, doubter) relates to the Western idea of多元化的意见 (diverse opinions) which is present in Enlightenment thinkers like Voltaire who advocated for tolerance and considering multiple viewpoints. Also, the concept of not being aware of one's faults, which ties into the idea of hubris in Greek philosophy, or the need for critical self-assessment as in Descartes' method of doubt. The story emphasizes the importance of humility and seeking advice, which aligns with the Western idea of the importance of feedback and continuous learning.

Wait, but the user mentioned 荀子, which is Xun Zi, known for his emphasis on human nature being inherently evil and the need for strict education and laws. However, the passage here seems to align more with the idea of self-criticism and seeking advice, which might be a bit different from Xun Zi's usual themes. Maybe the user made a mistake in citing the source? Because the passage talks about a king's decision-making and the advice similar to 楚庄王's story, which is from the 周易 (I Ching) perhaps? Or maybe it's from another part of Xun Zi's works. Regardless, the translation should be accurate first.

So, translating the story: Make sure to keep the Chinese names and terms. Then, the moral is about the importance of self-awareness and seeking different perspectives to avoid downfall. The Western counterpart would be concepts like the value of diverse opinions, the role of critical self-examination, and the dangers of unchecked confidence, which can be linked to philosophers like Socrates (his method of questioning),孔子 himself (Confucian wisdom), or Enlightenment figures.

Need to ensure that the translation is clear and captures the nuances. For example, "退朝而有喜色" translates to "after retreating to his chambers, he looked喜色 (happy/cheerful)", but the context is that he was happy because he made a good decision, but Fü Ch'i points out that actually, he should be worried because he's not aware of his faults. So the translation needs to convey that initial happiness is misleading.

Also, the quote from 楚庄王: "诸侯自为得师者王, 得友者霸, 得疑者存, 自为谋而莫己若者亡." Translating this as "If a ruler has a teacher, he can become a king; a friend, a duke; a doubter, a survivor; but if he plans alone without anyone to challenge him, he will perish." That's a key point. The concepts here are about different types of advisors and their roles in governance, which is similar to the Western idea of having diverse counsel to avoid poor decisions.

So, the counterpart in Western thought would be the idea of checks and balances, the importance of collective decision-making, and the value of critical friends or devil's advocate roles in preventing hubris. Thinkers like Machiavelli in "The Prince" discuss the importance of knowing oneself, but also, the Stoics emphasized self-awareness and rationality. The concept of the "fool" in Proverbs as a person to consult for wise advice. Also, the Enlightenment emphasis on reason and seeking multiple perspectives.

Putting it all together: the translation should be accurate, the moral is about self-awareness and seeking diverse counsel to avoid downfall, and the Western counterparts include the value of diverse opinions, checks and balances, and the dangers of overconfidence, found in various philosophical traditions.

### (1) Translation into English:  
The story goes: When the Duke of Wei [魏武侯] discussed matters of state and achieved the correct solution, none of his officials could keep up. After retreating to his chambers, he looked cheerful. Fü Ch'i [吴起] approached him and asked, "Have you ever heard the words of the King of Chu [楚庄王] mentioned to his officials?" The Duke replied, "What did the King of Chu say?" Fü Ch'i responded, "When the King of Chu discussed matters and reached the right decision, none of his officials could match him. After retreating, he appeared worried. An official named申公巫臣 asked, 'Why do you look so worried, Your Majesty?' The king said, 'I worry because even though I make the right decisions, no one can match me. This is a problem mentioned in the Book of Changes: 'A ruler who has no teacher will become a king; one with no friend will become a duke; one with no doubter will survive, but a ruler who plans alone and finds no one superior to himself will perish.' Now, since I am so inferior [unwise], and my officials cannot keep up, it seems my state is near ruin—so I worry.' The King of Chu worried, but you [the Duke of Wei] are cheerful." The Duke of Wei then bowed twice and said, "You have corrected my mistake, divinely."

### (2) Moral of the Story:  
The story emphasizes the dangers of unchecked confidence and the importance of self-awareness. Even when one achieves success (like the Duke of Wei’s correct decisions), complacency or pride can lead to downfall. The moral highlights the need to recognize one’s limitations, seek diverse perspectives (a "teacher," "friend," or "doubter"), and avoid isolation in decision-making. It warns that ignoring these principles risks ruin, as the King of Chu realized: a ruler who cannot challenge himself with others’ wisdom will inevitably fail.

### (3) Western Counterparts:  
Yes, the concepts in the story resonate with Western philosophical ideas:  
- **Teacher, Friend, Doubter**: The need for diverse perspectives aligns with the Enlightenment ideal of "collective wisdom" (e.g., Voltaire’s "l’ Esprit de Corps") and the value of critical friends or devil’s advocate roles in modern decision-making.  
- **"Self as the Worst Enemy"**: The idea that isolation leads to hubris mirrors Socrates’ belief that unexamined lives are not worth living, or the Stoic emphasis on self-reflection.  
- **"No One Superior to Himself"**: The warning against unchecked confidence parallels Machiavelli’s *The Prince* (hubris destroys rulers) or the Cartesian maxim *cogito, ergo sum* (self-doubt as foundational to reason).  
- **Proverbs**: The saying "Without many advisors, one cannot plan wisely" echoes Proverbs 11:14 ("Better a few advisors than the advice of many [but] without many advisors, one goes astray").  

In essence, the story’s themes of humility, collaborative governance, and self-criticism find echoes in Western thought on the dangers of overconfidence and the
