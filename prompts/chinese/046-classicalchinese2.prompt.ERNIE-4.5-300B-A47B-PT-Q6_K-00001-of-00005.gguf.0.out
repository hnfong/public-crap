### (1) Translation of the Story

King Wei of Wei was deliberating on matters with great appropriateness, and none of his ministers could match him. After retiring from court, he wore a look of delight. Wu Qi stepped forward and said, "Have you ever heard, through those around you, the words of King Zhuang of Chu?" King Wei asked, "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?" Wu Qi replied, "King Zhuang of Chu, when deliberating on matters with great appropriateness, found none of his ministers could match him. After retiring from court, he wore a look of concern. Shen Gong Wuchen stepped forward and asked, 'Your Majesty wears a look of concern upon retiring from court. Why is that?' King Zhuang said, 'I deliberate on matters with great appropriateness, and none of my ministers can match me. That is why I am concerned. There is a saying by Zhong Gui, which goes: "Those rulers who find themselves a true teacher will reign supreme; those who find themselves true friends will achieve hegemony; those who find themselves advisors who can raise doubts will survive; but those who scheme for themselves and think no one can match them will perish." Now, with my own lack of virtue, and none of my ministers able to match me, our state is on the verge of perishing! That is why I am concerned.' King Zhuang of Chu was concerned, yet you, my lord, are delighted." King Wei hesitated, then bowed twice and said, "It is Heaven that has sent you, sir, to correct my faults."

### (2) Explanation of the Moral of the Story

The moral of the story lies in the importance of self-awareness and humility for rulers (or leaders in general). King Zhuang of Chu, despite his wisdom and the inability of his ministers to match him, remained concerned because he recognized the danger of being surrounded by yes-men or those who could not challenge his ideas. He understood that true leadership requires not just intelligence but also the ability to listen to and learn from others, especially those who can offer different perspectives or raise doubts. In contrast, King Wei of Wei's initial delight at his own superiority over his ministers revealed a lack of such self-awareness and humility. Wu Qi's intervention, by recounting the story of King Zhuang, served as a wake-up call, reminding King Wei that true greatness lies not in being the smartest person in the room but in fostering an environment where diverse ideas can flourish and where one is open to learning from others.

### (3) Counterparts in Western (European) Thought

Yes, the concepts in this story have counterparts in Western (European) thought. One prominent example is the idea of the "Socratic method," named after the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates. The Socratic method involves asking probing questions to stimulate critical thinking and to illuminate ideas. It emphasizes the importance of questioning one's own beliefs and assumptions, as well as those of others, in order to arrive at a deeper understanding of truth. This aligns with the story's emphasis on the need for rulers to be open to challenge and to seek out diverse perspectives.

Another relevant concept is the idea of "servant leadership," which has been popularized in modern management theory but has roots in various philosophical and religious traditions. Servant leadership emphasizes the leader's role as a servant first, focusing on the growth and well-being of the people and the communities to which they belong. This approach requires humility, empathy, and a willingness to listen and learn from others, much like the attitude exhibited by King Zhuang of Chu in the story.

In both cases, the underlying principle is that true leadership involves a commitment to continuous learning, self-improvement, and the fostering of an environment where diverse ideas can be expressed and considered. [end of text]
