Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user provided a passage from Xunzi and wants three things: a translation into English, an explanation of the moral, and a comparison to Western thought.

First, the translation. I need to make sure I understand the original Chinese text accurately. The story involves King Wu of Wei and Wu Qi discussing the difference between King Wu of Wei's happiness after a successful decision versus King Chu's Chu King Zhuang Wang's worry. Proper names like 魏武侯 and 楚莊王 should stay in Chinese as requested. I'll need to translate the dialogue and the quotes properly, ensuring the nuances are captured. For example, "謀事而當" means "plans and decisions are correct," and "退朝而有憂色" translates to "leaving court with a worried expression."

Next, the moral of the story. From the context, King Wu of Wei is happy after a good decision, but Wu Qi reminds him of Chu King Zhuang Wang's caution. The key point is that success should be met with humility and awareness of potential failure, not complacency. The moral is about recognizing one's limitations and the importance of self-reflection to avoid downfall.

Now, the Western counterpart. The story touches on themes like self-awareness, humility, and the dangers of overconfidence. In Western philosophy, similar ideas appear in Stoicism, where Marcus Aurelius emphasized self-awareness and the impermanence of success. Also, the concept of "hubris" in Greek tragedy warns against excessive pride leading to downfall. Plato's dialogues often discuss the importance of recognizing one's ignorance, which aligns with the story's message.

I should structure the response clearly, starting with the translation, then the moral, and finally the Western parallels. Make sure the translation is accurate and the explanations are concise but thorough. Check for any cultural nuances that might need clarification, but since the user asked to keep proper names in Chinese, focus on translating the content accurately without altering names.

### (1) Translation into English  
King Wu of Wei (Wu of Wei) had plans and decisions that were correct, and no minister could match him. After court sessions, he would leave with a pleased expression. Wu Qi (Wu Qi) stepped forward and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Chu Zhuangwang of Chu (Chu King Zhuangwang)?" King Wu replied, "What did King Chu Zhuangwang say?" Wu Qi answered, "When King Chu Zhuangwang’s plans and decisions were correct, and no minister could match him, he would leave court with a worried expression. Shen Gong Wuchen (Shen Gong Wuchen) stepped forward and asked, 'Your Majesty, why do you look worried?' King Zhuangwang replied, 'I worry because my plans and decisions are correct, and no minister can match me. This is what Zhonglei (Zhonglei) once said: 'A ruler who finds a teacher becomes a king; one who finds a friend becomes a hegemon; one who remains doubtful survives; but one who relies solely on his own plans and believes no one can surpass him will perish.' Now, because of my own lack of virtue, and the fact that no minister can match me, our state is nearly doomed. That is why I worry.' King Chu Zhuangwang was worried, but you are pleased." King Wu of Wei hesitated and bowed twice, saying, "Heaven has sent you to correct my mistakes."

### (2) Moral of the Story  
The story emphasizes the importance of **humility and self-awareness** in leadership. King Wu of Wei’s initial pride after a successful decision is contrasted with King Chu Zhuangwang’s caution and worry. The moral is that success should not breed complacency but should instead prompt reflection on one’s limitations and the potential for failure. It warns against overconfidence and underscores the value of recognizing one’s own fallibility, as failure to do so can lead to downfall. Wu Qi’s lesson highlights that true wisdom lies in understanding that no one is infallible and that even the most successful decisions require vigilance and self-correction.

### (3) Counterpart in Western Thought  
Yes, the concepts in the story have parallels in Western philosophy, particularly in **Stoicism** and **Greek tragedy**.  
- **Stoicism**: Thinkers like Marcus Aurelius emphasized self-awareness, humility, and the impermanence of success. For example, Marcus Aurelius wrote in *Meditations* about the dangers of pride and the importance of recognizing one’s own limitations.  
- **Greek Tragedy**: The theme of hubris (excessive pride) leading to downfall is central to Greek tragedies, such as Sophocles’ *Oedipus Rex* or Euripides’ *Medea*. Characters who ignore warnings or overestimate their abilities often face catastrophic consequences.  
- **Plato’s Dialogues**: Plato’s Socrates often stressed the importance of questioning one’s own knowledge and remaining open to criticism, as seen in *The Apology* and *The Republic*. This aligns with the story’s message of humility and self-reflection.  

In essence, the story’s emphasis on humility, self-awareness, and the dangers of overconfidence resonates with Western philosophical traditions that value introspection and the recognition of human fallibility. [end of text]
