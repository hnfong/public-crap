Okay, here is the translation, explanation of the moral, and a comparison with Western thought.

**(1) Translation into English:**

King Wu of Wei planned a matter and handled it correctly; none of his ministers could match him. When he left court, he had a look of satisfaction. Wu Qi approached and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu mentioned to Your Majesty?"

King Wu asked, "What were the words of King Zhuang of Chu like?"

Wu Qi replied, "When King Zhuang of Chu planned a matter and handled it correctly, none of his ministers could match him. When he left court, he had a look of worry. Shen Gong Wu Chen approached and asked, 'Your Majesty has a look of worry after court. Why is this?' King Zhuang said, 'I handle matters correctly, and none of my ministers can match me, which is why I worry. As it says in the words of Zhong Hui (Zhong Yao), "Rulers who find teachers among the people will become Kings; those who find friends among them will become Hegemons; those who find peers (or advisors who can challenge them) among them can maintain their state; those who rely solely on their own counsel and find no one wiser than themselves will perish." Now, considering my own lack of virtue and ability, and that none of my ministers can match me, my state is nearly doomed to destruction! This is why I worry.' King Zhuang of Chu worried, while Your Majesty rejoices."

King Wu of Wei, feeling uneasy, bowed twice and said, "Heaven has sent Your esteemed lord (Wu Qi) to correct my mistake."

**(2) Explanation of the Moral:**

The moral of the story is that **true wisdom and prudence for a ruler lie not in personal accomplishment alone, but in recognizing the need for capable advisors and the potential dangers of being surrounded by sycophants or lacking critical perspectives.** King Wu of Wei's satisfaction with his own competence and the inability of his ministers to challenge him is seen as dangerous arrogance. It suggests he lacks the necessary checks and balances, potentially leading to poor decisions and the decline of his state. King Zhuang of Chu, conversely, demonstrates humility and foresight by recognizing that his own success without capable subordinates signals a critical weakness – the lack of talent and diverse counsel – which threatens the very survival of his state, as warned by the saying attributed to Zhong Yao. Wu Qi uses this story to teach King Wu that pride in personal ability is misplaced if it comes at the cost of having a strong and diverse team, and that true leadership involves self-awareness and the cultivation of talent.

**(3) Counterparts in Western (European) Thought:**

Yes, the concepts in this story have clear counterparts in Western thought, particularly in political philosophy and leadership advice:

1.  **The Importance of Counsel:** The idea that rulers should seek and value the advice of wise and capable counselors is a recurring theme. Thinkers like **Machiavelli** in *The Prince* advise rulers to surround themselves with honest, competent advisors and to listen to them, even when the advice is unpleasant. He warns against flattery. The Roman historian **Sallust** also emphasized the dangers of a ruler relying solely on their own judgment and the importance of virtuous counsel.
2.  **The Dangers of Isolation and Arrogance:** The story reflects the Western concept of the dangers of a ruler becoming isolated or developing hubris (*hubris*). Philosophers like **Plato** in *The Republic* discuss the ideal ruler needing wisdom and temperance, implicitly warning against unchecked power and pride. The concept of *hubris* leading to *nemesis* (downfall) is central to Greek tragedy and often applied to political figures.
3.  **The Need for Checks and Balances:** While not always explicitly about ministers, Western political thought, especially from the Enlightenment onwards (e.g., **Montesquieu**), emphasizes the importance of institutional checks and balances to prevent the concentration of power and the potential for tyranny or poor decision-making that arises from unchecked authority. King Wu's situation, where no minister can "match" him, lacks this crucial dynamic tension.
4.  **Humility and Self-Awareness in Leadership:** The story aligns with the Western ideal of the *humble leader* or the *philosopher-king* (Plato), someone who recognizes their own limitations and the value of others' knowledge and perspectives. The ability to admit ignorance or the need for help is often seen as a strength, not a weakness, in effective leadership.

In essence, while the specific cultural context and the exact phrasing (like the Zhong Yao quote) are Chinese, the underlying principles about the qualities of good leadership, the importance of counsel, and the pitfalls of arrogance are fundamental themes shared across many civilizations, including Western European thought.
