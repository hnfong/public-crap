Here is the translation and analysis of the passage from Xunzi.

### (1) Translation

Marquis Wu of Wei deliberated on affairs of state and made the right decisions; none of his ministers could match his ability. After retiring from the court, he wore a look of joy.

Wu Qi stepped forward and asked, "Has Your Lordship ever heard the story of King Zhuang of Chu?"

Marquis Wu asked, "What about King Zhuang of Chu?"

Wu Qi replied, "King Zhuang of Chu deliberated on affairs and made the right decisions; none of his ministers could match him. Yet, after retiring from the court, he wore a look of worry. Shen Gong Wu Chen stepped forward and asked: 'Your Majesty retired with a look of worry; why is that?'

"King Zhuang replied: 'I deliberated on affairs and made the right decisions, yet none of my ministers could match me. That is why I am worried. There is a saying by Zhong Gui: "A ruler who finds himself a teacher shall become a true King; one who finds himself a friend shall become a Hegemon; one who finds those who can question him shall survive; but one who deliberates on his own with no one equal to him shall perish." Now, given my own unworthiness, yet none of my ministers can match me, my state is on the brink of perishing! That is why I am worried.'

"King Zhuang was worried about this, yet you, My Lord, are joyful over it."

Marquis Wu stepped back in humility, bowed twice, and said, "Heaven has sent the Master to correct my faults."

### (2) The Moral of the Story

The central moral of the story is the danger of **intellectual arrogance** and the vital importance of **surrounding oneself with capable advisors**.

Specifically, the story contrasts two reactions to being the smartest person in the room:
1.  **The Trap of Vanity (Marquis Wu):** He views his superiority over his ministers as a personal triumph, proof of his own genius. This leads to complacency.
2.  **The Insight of Responsibility (King Zhuang):** He views his superiority as a systemic failure. If the ruler is the only one capable of making decisions, the state lacks depth, resilience, and corrective mechanisms.

The quote within the story ("He who finds a teacher becomes a King...") outlines a hierarchy of leadership:
*   **Teacher:** Someone who corrects you and guides you (highest level).
*   **Friend:** Someone who advises you as an equal.
*   **Questioner:** Someone who at least challenges your views.
*   **Solitary Superior:** If no one is as smart as you, you are blind to your own errors, leading to ruin.

The moral is that a wise ruler should not strive to be the smartest person in the room, but rather strive to employ people smarter than himself. A leader's strength comes from the collective wisdom of his ministers, not his own individual brilliance.

### (3) Counterparts in Western Thought

Yes, there are strong parallels in Western thought regarding the dangers of "yes-men" and the value of wise counsel.

**1. The "First Man" Problem (Plato/Aristotle)**
The ancient Greeks had a concept similar to the fear expressed by King Zhuang. Aristotle and Plato discussed the problem of the "superior man" (*spoudaios*) or the "first man." If a man is so superior in virtue and intelligence that he cannot be held accountable by his peers, he becomes like a god among men. While Aristotle suggests such a man should be a king, there is an underlying anxiety in Western philosophy about the isolated autocrat who answers to no one. If the ruler has no "friend" or "teacher" (as the Chinese text suggests), he lacks the mirror needed to see his own faults.

**2. The Danger of Flattery (Machiavelli)**
Niccolò Machiavelli, in *The Prince* (Chapter 23), addresses this directly. He warns that a prince must choose wise ministers, but more importantly, he must keep them honest.
*   Machiavelli writes that a prince who is not wise himself cannot be well advised unless he puts himself in the hands of a single, wise advisor.
*   He warns against flatterers: "I do not wish to leave out a point... which is a snare from which princes cannot easily protect themselves, unless they are very prudent... this is the snare of flatterers."
*   Machiavelli advises that a prince should encourage truth-telling, but only when he asks for it. This parallels the story's emphasis that a ruler needs people who can "match" him or "question" him (*de yi*), rather than just following him.

**3. The Stoic "Friend" (Seneca)**
The Roman philosopher Seneca wrote extensively on friendship. He argued that a ruler or a wise man needs a friend not for utility, but to have a "second self"—someone who can offer honest correction. In his *Letters*, Seneca warns against the isolation of power, suggesting that a man who trusts no one and listens to no one (like a ruler whose ministers "cannot match him") is vulnerable to error and madness.

**Summary of Comparison:**
While the Chinese text focuses on the **survival of the state** (political realism) and the Western tradition often focuses on the **virtue of the ruler** or the **mechanics of counsel**, both traditions agree on the core axiom: **A leader who is unmatched in wisdom is in the greatest danger, because he has no one to correct his mistakes.** [end of text]
