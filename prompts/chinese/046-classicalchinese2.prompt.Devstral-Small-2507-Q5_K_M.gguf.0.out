(1) Translation of the story into English:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

Translation:
Wei Wu Hou was planning something and his plan was correct, but none of his ministers could match him. After the court session, he had a look of joy on his face. Wu Qi approached and said, "Have you ever heard of the words of King Zhao of Chu?" Wei Wu Hou asked, "What did King Zhao of Chu say?" Wu Qi replied, "King Zhao of Chu planned something and his plan was correct, but none of his ministers could match him. After the court session, he had a look of worry on his face. Shen Gong Wu Shen approached and asked, 'Your Majesty, why do you have a look of worry after the court session?' King Zhao replied, 'I planned something and my plan was correct, but none of my ministers could match me. This is why I am worried. As the saying goes, 'A ruler who finds a teacher becomes a king, one who finds a friend becomes a hegemon, one who finds someone to doubt becomes a survivor, and one who plans alone and finds no one better than himself perishes.' Now, with my lack of virtue, and none of my ministers can match me, my country is close to perishing! This is why I am worried.' King Zhao of Chu was worried, but you are joyful." Wei Wu Hou hesitated and then bowed twice, saying, "Heaven has sent you, Master, to correct my mistakes."

(2) Moral of the story:

The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should be humble and concerned about the lack of capable ministers, rather than being proud and complacent. King Zhao of Chu was worried because he realized that his lack of capable ministers could lead to the downfall of his country. On the other hand, Wei Wu Hou was joyful, which showed his lack of humility and concern for his country's future.

(3) Counterpart in Western (European) thought:

The concepts in the story have a counterpart in Western thought, particularly in the works of Niccolò Machiavelli. In his book "The Prince," Machiavelli discusses the importance of a ruler having capable advisors and being open to their advice. He also emphasizes the importance of humility and self-awareness in a ruler. The story of Wei Wu Hou and King Zhao of Chu can be seen as an illustration of Machiavelli's ideas about the importance of having capable advisors and being humble and self-aware. [end of text]
