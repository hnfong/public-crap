《Zhang Shi’s and Feng Tang’s Combined Biographies》
Zhang Tingwei, styled Shi, was a man from Duyang. He had an older brother named Zhong who lived with him. He obtained the rank of Riding Companion through his wealth and served Emperor Xiaowen for ten years without being assigned a position, remaining largely unknown. Shi said, “Prolonged service in the palace diminishes my brother’s resources; it is not to my liking.” He wished to resign and return home. Yuan Ang, a Middle Guard General, recognized his talent and regretted his departure, so he requested that Shi be transferred to the position of Attendant Officer. After Shi completed his duties for the day, he took the opportunity to offer advice. Emperor Xiaowen said, “Treat him with respect, but do not allow overly ambitious pronouncements; let what can be implemented be done now.” Thus, Shi spoke of the affairs between the Qin and Han dynasties, detailing for a long time the reasons for Qin’s failure and Han’s success. Emperor Xiaowen praised him and appointed Shi as Attendant Officer and Chief Attendant.

Shi accompanied the emperor on a journey, arriving at the Tiger Enclosure. The emperor questioned the officer in charge of the Upper Forest about the number of various beasts, asking more than ten questions. The officer and his assistants, despite their best efforts, were unable to answer. The assistant steward of the Tiger Enclosure stepped forward and answered the emperor’s questions about the beasts with great detail, intending to observe Shi’s ability to respond quickly and comprehensively. Emperor Xiaowen said, “It is not proper for officials to behave this way! The officer is incompetent!” He then ordered Shi to appoint the assistant steward as Officer in Charge of the Upper Forest. Shi, after a long time, said, “Your Majesty, what do you think of Zhou Bo, the Marquis of Prongs?” The emperor said, “He is an elder statesman.” He asked again, “How does Zhang Xiang, the Marquis of Dongyang, compare?” The emperor replied again, “He is an elder statesman.” Shi said, “Since the Marquis of Prongs and the Marquis of Dongyang are called elder statesmen, and these two men were unable to articulate their views on affairs of state, how could this assistant steward, with his quick wit and ready tongue, possibly be worthy of such a position! Moreover, Qin relied on officials skilled in writing and record-keeping, and officials competed to be strict and exacting in their assessments, but this benefited only the written records, lacking genuine compassion. Therefore, no one dared to point out their flaws, leading to their downfall and the demise of the Second Emperor, and the collapse of the empire. Now, Your Majesty elevates this assistant steward based on his eloquence, and I fear that the empire will follow the wind, with everyone striving for quick wit rather than substance.” Emperor Xiaowen said, “Well spoken.” He then halted the appointment of the assistant steward.

The emperor boarded his carriage and summoned Shi to ride alongside him, proceeding slowly and questioning Shi about the failings of Qin. Shi provided a detailed account. Upon reaching the palace, the emperor appointed Shi as Commander of the Imperial Chariots.

Shortly thereafter, the Crown Prince and the Prince of Liang traveled in the same carriage to the court, but did not dismount at the Sima Gate. Shi then pursued and stopped the Crown Prince and the Prince of Liang from entering the palace gate. He subsequently accused them of disrespect for failing to dismount at the public gate and submitted a report. Empress Dowager Bo heard of this and, removing her crown, expressed her gratitude, saying, “I will instruct my sons to be more respectful.” Empress Dowager Bo then sent an emissary to issue a pardon to the Crown Prince and the Prince of Liang, after which they were allowed to enter. Emperor Xiaowen was greatly impressed by Shi and appointed him as a Major Counselor.

Shortly thereafter, he was appointed as a Middle Guard General. He accompanied the emperor on a journey to the Baling Mausoleum, residing north of the latrines. At that time, Lady Shun accompanied the emperor, and the emperor pointed out the route to Xin Feng to Lady Shun, saying, “This is the road to Handan.” He instructed Lady Shun to play the zither, and the emperor himself played the se and sang, his mood filled with sorrowful and melancholic feelings. He turned to the ministers and said, “Alas! To use stones from the northern mountains as a coffin, lined with floss and lacquered inside, how could it be disturbed!” Those around him all said, “Well spoken.” Shi stepped forward and said, “If there is something desirable within, even a mountain may be breached; if there is nothing desirable within, even without a stone coffin, what sorrow is there?” Emperor Xiaowen praised him. Afterward, he appointed Shi as Minister of Justice.

Shortly thereafter, the emperor traveled past the Zhongwei Bridge, and a man emerged from beneath the bridge, startling the emperor’s horses. He ordered the cavalry to pursue and arrest him, placing him under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Justice. Shi investigated the matter. He learned that the man was a local resident who, upon hearing the imperial procession, had hidden beneath the bridge. After a long time, believing the procession had passed, he emerged and, upon seeing the emperor’s carriage and cavalry, fled in fear. The Minister of Justice in Qin would have imposed a fine on anyone who startled the emperor. Emperor Xiaowen angrily said, “This man startled my horses, and my horses are gentle. What if it had been another horse, would it not have injured me? Yet the Minister of Justice would impose a fine on him!” Shi said, “The law is a common possession of the emperor and the people of the empire. Now that the law is this way, and it is being made even stricter, the law will not be trusted by the people. Moreover, at the time, Your Majesty could have ordered his immediate execution. Now that the matter has been referred to the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Justice is the embodiment of fairness in the empire. If it is overturned, the application of the law throughout the empire will become inconsistent, and the people will not know where to place their hands and feet.” After a long time, the emperor said, “The Minister of Justice is correct.”

Thereafter, a man stole a jade ring from before the main hall of the High Temple. He was captured, and Emperor Xiaowen was furious, ordering the Minister of Justice to investigate. Shi examined the statutes and found that those who stole items of clothing and ornaments from ancestral temples should be executed. He submitted a report recommending execution. The emperor became enraged, saying, “This man is without virtue, and dares to steal the artifacts of the former emperor. I entrusted the Minister of Justice with the power to exterminate his clan, yet you recommend execution according to the law, which is not what I intend when sharing the reverence for the ancestral temples.” Shi removed his crown and prostrated himself, saying, “The law is sufficient in this case. Moreover, crimes differ in severity. Now, to exterminate his clan for stealing artifacts from the ancestral temples is like punishing one in ten thousand. If a foolish person were to take even a handful of earth from the Mausoleum, what punishment would Your Majesty impose upon him?” After a long time, Emperor Xiaowen discussed the matter with the Empress Dowager, who then allowed the Minister of Justice to carry out the execution. At that time, Zhou Yafu, the Middle Guard General, and Wang Tian, the Marquis of Shanyu, met with Shi and discussed maintaining order, and they formed a close friendship. Zhang Tingwei became renowned throughout the empire as a result.

Later, Emperor Xiaowen passed away, and Emperor Jing ascended the throne. Shi, fearing repercussions, feigned illness. He wished to resign, fearing severe punishment, but was unsure how to seek an audience to express his gratitude. He followed Wang Sheng’s advice and finally sought an audience to express his gratitude, but Emperor Jing showed little interest.

Wang Sheng was skilled in the doctrines of Huang-Lao philosophy and was a scholar. He was summoned to reside in the court, where all the Three Excellencies and Nine Ministers gathered. Wang Sheng, an old man, said, “I will unravel this,” and turned to Zhang Tingwei, saying, “Kneel and tie this knot for me!” Shi knelt and tied the knot. Afterward, some people asked Wang Sheng, “Why did you humiliate Zhang Tingwei, making him kneel and tie a knot?” Wang Sheng said, “I am old and insignificant, and I believe I will be of no benefit to Zhang Tingwei. Zhang Tingwei is a renowned statesman today, so I merely humiliated the Minister of Justice to show my respect for him.” The ministers heard this and admired Wang Sheng, and in turn, respected Zhang Tingwei even more.

Zhang Tingwei served Emperor Jing for a year and was appointed as the Chancellor of the Chu Kingdom, but still maintained his previous principles. After a long time, Shi passed away. His son, Zhang Zhi, styled Changgong, became a high-ranking official but resigned. He did not pursue a career for life, as he was unable to gain the favor of the current generation.

Feng Tang, his great-grandfather was from Zhao. His father moved to Dai. After the Han Dynasty was established, he moved to Anling. Tang became known for his filial piety and served as the head of the Middle Guard Office under Emperor Xiaowen. When the emperor’s procession passed by, he asked Tang, “What does an old man like you do as a head of the office? Where is your home?” Tang provided a detailed account. Emperor Xiaowen said, “When I was in Dai, Gao Di often spoke of the merits of Li Qi, the Zhao general, during the Battle of Julu. Now, whenever I eat, I am still at Julu in my thoughts. Does your father know of this?” Tang replied, “He is not as skilled as Lian Po and Li Mu as generals.” The emperor asked, “Why?” Tang said, “My great-grandfather was an official and general in Zhao, and he admired Li Mu. My father was formerly the Chancellor of Dai and knew the qualities of Zhao general Li Qi.” Upon hearing of Lian Po and Li Mu, the emperor was pleased and slapped his thigh, saying, “Alas! If only I had Lian Po and Li Mu as my generals, would I have to worry about the Xiongnu?” Tang said, “Your Majesty, even if you had Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them effectively.” The emperor became angry and rose to return to the inner palace. After a long time, he summoned Tang and asked, “Why did you insult me, speaking so freely?” Tang replied, “I am a humble man and do not know what is taboo.”

At that time, the Xiongnu had recently made a large incursion into the court, killing the Commander of North Land, Yumi. The emperor, concerned about the Huns, questioned Tang again, “Why do you know that I cannot use Lian Po and Li Mu?” Tang replied, “I have heard that in ancient times, when kings sent generals, they knelt and recommended them, saying that those within the border were controlled by the emperor, and those outside the border were controlled by the general. Military achievements and rewards were decided externally, and reported upon their return. This is not an empty statement.” Tang continued, “My great-grandfather said that Li Mu, as a general of Zhao, managed the border, and the rent from military markets was used to reward his soldiers, and rewards were decided externally, not interfered with from within. By entrusting them with responsibility and demanding success, Li Mu was able to fully utilize his talents, selecting one thousand three hundred chariots, ten thousand three hundred cavalry, and one hundred thousand soldiers with gold. Thus, he drove the single-honed Xiongnu north, defeated the Donghu, destroyed the Danlin, suppressed the strong Qin in the west, and supported Han and Wei in the south. At that time, Zhao was on the verge of dominance.” He continued, “Later, Zhao King Qian ascended the throne, and his mother, a concubine, was influential. King Qian used Guo Kai’s slanderous accusations and ultimately executed Li Mu, replacing him with Yan Ju. Thus, the army was defeated in the north and destroyed by Qin. Now, I have heard that Wei is still the Guardian of Yunzhong, and the rent from his military markets is used to reward his soldiers, and he raises private funds, providing one ox every five days to entertain guests, military officials, and servants. Thus, the Xiongnu avoid Yunzhong. Once, the Huns invaded, and he led chariots and cavalry to attack them, killing many of their soldiers. Soldiers are all sons of families, rising from the fields to serve in the army. How can they know the details of their registration and unit assignments? They fight tirelessly all day, capturing heads and prisoners, but there is no reward for their efforts, and officials enforce the law strictly. I am foolish, but I believe Your Majesty’s laws are too strict, and the rewards are too light, and the punishments are too heavy. Moreover, the Guardian of Yunzhong, Wei, was rewarded for his achievements, but you are reducing his rank and imposing a penalty. Based on this, even if Your Majesty had Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them.” Tang continued, “I am foolish and have touched upon a taboo, deserving of death, deserving of death!” Emperor Xiaowen was impressed. On that day, he ordered Feng Tang to hold a seal and pardon Wei, restoring him to his position as Guardian of Yunzhong, and appointed Tang as the Commander of Chariots and Cavalry, overseeing the Middle Guard and the military of the kingdoms.

Seven years later, Emperor Jing ascended the throne and appointed Tang as the Chancellor of Chu, but he resigned. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne and sought talented individuals, he recommended Feng Tang. Tang was over ninety years old at the time and unable to serve as an official, so he recommended his son, Feng Sui, as a Companion. Sui, styled Wangsun, was also a remarkable man and a friend of mine.

The Grand Historian said: Zhang Jizi spoke of elder statesmen, upholding the law without flattery; Feng Gong’s discussion of generals and their leadership had substance! It had substance! It is said, “If you do not know a person, observe his friends.” The reputations of these two men are worthy of being recorded in the halls of history. The Book of Rites says, “Without bias and without favoritism, the king’s path is broad; without partisanship and without favoritism, the king’s path is smooth.” Zhang Jizi and Feng Gong came close to this ideal.
