<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to translate the Chinese text into English. The instruction: For proper names (people, emperors, places) use the original Chinese to avoid inconsistency in transliteration. So we keep Chinese names as is, not transliterated. So we keep characters like 張廷尉, 釋之, 文帝, etc. We should not transliterate them. So we keep Chinese characters. The text is long. We need to produce a translation. No explanation. Just the translated text. Use literal translation if in doubt.

We need to preserve the names. Also we need to keep the Chinese characters for names. For example, "張廷尉" remains "張廷尉". "釋之" remains "釋之". "文帝" remains "文帝". "太史公" remains "太史公". "張季" remains "張季". "馮公" remains "馮公". "王道" etc. We need to keep Chinese characters for names. For other words, we translate into English.

We need to produce a coherent translation. The text is a historical biography. We need to translate each sentence. Let's go through the text.

The text starts with:

《張釋之馮唐列傳》 (Title: Biography of 張釋之 and 馮唐)

Then the body:

張廷尉釋之者，堵陽人也，字季。有兄仲同居。以訾為騎郎，事孝文帝，十歲不得調，無所知名。釋之曰：「久宦減仲之產，不遂。」欲自免歸。中郎將袁盎知其賢，惜其去，乃請徙釋之補謁者。釋之既朝畢，因前言便宜事。文帝曰：「卑之，毋甚高論，令今可施行也。」於是釋之言秦漢之閒事，秦所以失而漢所以興者久之。文帝稱善，乃拜釋之為謁者仆射。

We need to translate. Let's do step by step.

"張廷尉釋之者，堵陽人也，字季。" -> "The person named 張廷尉 釋之 was from Dudang? Wait, '堵陽' is a place. So: '張廷尉 釋之 was a person from Dudang, with the courtesy name 季.'"

But we need to keep Chinese names. So: "張廷尉 釋之 was a person from 堵陽, with the courtesy name 季."

"有兄仲同居。" -> "He had a brother named 仲 who lived with him." But we keep names: "He had a brother named 仲 who lived with him."

"以訾為騎郎，事孝文帝，十歲不得調，無所知名。" -> "He served as a cavalry officer under 學文帝, but at age ten he could not be promoted and was unknown." Wait, "十歲不得調" means at age ten he could not be promoted. "無所知名" means he was not known. So: "He served as a cavalry officer under 學文帝; at age ten he could not be promoted and was unknown."

But "孝文帝" is an emperor. So we keep "孝文帝". So: "He served as a cavalry officer under 孝文帝; at age ten he could not be promoted and was unknown."

"釋之曰：「久宦減仲之產，不遂。」欲自免歸。" -> "釋之 said: 'For a long time, the officialdom has reduced 仲's inheritance, not succeeding.' He wanted to resign and return." But we need to keep names. So: "釋之 said: 'For a long time, the officialdom has reduced 仲's inheritance, not succeeding.' He wanted to resign and return."

But maybe "久宦減仲之產，不遂" means "For a long time, the officialdom has reduced 仲's property, not succeeding." So: "釋之 said: 'For a long time, the officialdom has reduced 仲's property, not succeeding.' He wanted to resign and return."

"中郎將袁盎知其賢，惜其去，乃請徙釋之補謁者。" -> "The lieutenant general 袁盎 knew his virtue, regretted his departure, and requested to transfer 釋之 to replace the official who was a '謁者'." But "補謁者" maybe means "to replace the official who was a '謁者'." So: "The lieutenant general 袁盎 recognized his virtue, regretted his departure, and requested to transfer 釋之 to replace the official who was a '謁者'."

"釋之既朝畢，因前言便宜事。" -> "After 釋之 finished his morning court, he used the previous words to ease matters." But "便宜事" maybe "to make things convenient." So: "After 釋之 finished his morning court, he used the previous words to make matters convenient."

"文帝曰：「卑之，毋甚高論，令今可施行也。」於是釋之言秦漢之閒事，秦所以失而漢所以興者久之。文帝稱善，乃拜釋之為謁者仆射。" -> "The emperor said: 'Be humble, do not speak too highly, let it be implemented now.' Thus 釋之 spoke about the affairs between Qin and Han, how Qin lost and Han rose, and he elaborated. The emperor praised him and appointed him as the official '謁者仆射'."

We need to keep Chinese names. So: "文帝 said: 'Be humble, do not speak too highly, let it be implemented now.' Thus 釋之 spoke about the affairs between 秦 and 漢, how 秦 lost and 漢 rose, and he elaborated. The emperor praised him and appointed him as the official '謁者仆射'."

Ok.

Next paragraph:

釋之從行，登虎圈。上問上林尉諸禽獸簿，十餘問，尉左右視，盡不能對。虎圈嗇夫從旁代尉對上所問禽獸簿甚悉，欲以觀其能口對響應無窮者。文帝曰：「吏不當若是邪？尉無賴！」乃詔釋之拜嗇夫為上林令。釋之久之前曰：「陛下以絳侯周勃何如人也？」上曰：「長者也。」又復問：「東陽侯張相如何如人也？」上復曰：「長者。」釋之曰：「夫絳侯、東陽侯稱為長者，此兩人言事曾不能出口，豈斅此嗇夫諜諜利口捷給哉！且秦以任刀筆之吏，吏爭以亟疾苛察相高，然其敝徒文具耳，無惻隱之實。以故不聞其過，陵遲而至於二世，天下土崩。今陛下以嗇夫口辯而超越之，臣恐天下隨風靡靡，爭為口辯而無其實。且下之化上疾於景響，舉錯不必不審也。」文帝曰：「善。」乃止不拜嗇夫。

We need to translate.

"釋之從行，登虎圈。" -> "釋之 went on a journey, climbed the tiger enclosure." But "虎圈" maybe "tiger enclosure" or "tiger cage." So: "釋之 went on a journey, climbed the tiger enclosure."

"上問上林尉諸禽獸簿，十餘問，尉左右視，盡不能對。" -> "The emperor asked the upper forest officer about the register of birds and beasts; he asked more than ten questions; the officer and his attendants looked at him but could not answer." So: "The emperor asked the upper forest officer about the register of birds and beasts; he asked more than ten questions; the officer and his attendants looked at him but could not answer."

"虎圈嗇夫從旁代尉對上所問禽獸簿甚悉，欲以觀其能口對響應無窮者。" -> "The tiger enclosure's miser (嗇夫) from beside replaced the officer and answered the emperor's questions about the register of birds and beasts very well, wanting to show his ability to answer endlessly." So: "The tiger enclosure's miser (嗇夫) from beside replaced the officer and answered the emperor's questions about the register of birds and beasts very well, wanting to show his ability to answer endlessly."

"文帝曰：「吏不當若是邪？尉無賴！」乃詔釋之拜嗇夫為上林令。" -> "The emperor said: 'An official should not be like this? The officer is not trustworthy!' He then decreed that 釋之 appoint the miser as the upper forest magistrate." So: "The emperor said: 'An official should not be like this? The officer is not trustworthy!' He then decreed that 釋之 appoint the miser as the upper forest magistrate."

"釋之久之前曰：「陛下以絳侯周勃何如人也？」上曰：「長者也。」又復問：「東陽侯張相如何如人也？」上復曰：「長者。」釋之曰：「夫絳侯、東陽侯稱為長者，此兩人言事曾不能出口，豈斅此嗇夫諜諜利口捷給哉！且秦以任刀筆之吏，吏爭以亟疾苛察相高，然其敝徒文具耳，無惻隱之實。以故不聞其過，陵遲而至於二世，天下土崩。今陛下以嗇夫口辯而超越之，臣恐天下隨風靡靡，爭為口辯而無其實。且下之化上疾於景響，舉錯不必不審也。」文帝曰：「善。」乃止不拜嗇夫。

We need to translate this long paragraph.

"釋之久之前曰：「陛下以絳侯周勃何如人也？」" -> "Long before, 釋之 said: 'Your Majesty, what kind of person is the Marquis of 絳, 周勃?'"

"上曰：「長者也。」" -> "The emperor replied: 'He is an elder.'"

"又復問：「東陽侯張相如何如人也？」" -> "He asked again: 'What kind of person is the Marquis of 東陽, 張相?'"

"上復曰：「長者。」" -> "The emperor replied: 'He is an elder.'"

"釋之曰：「夫絳侯、東陽侯稱為長者，此兩人言事曾不能出口，豈斅此嗇夫諜諜利口捷給哉！且秦以任刀筆之吏，吏爭以亟疾苛察相高，然其敝徒文具耳，無惻隱之實。以故不聞其過，陵遲而至於二世，天下土崩。今陛下以嗇夫口辯而超越之，臣恐天下隨風靡靡，爭為口辯而無其實。且下之化上疾於景響，舉錯不必不審也。」" -> This is a long argument. Let's translate.

"釋之 said: 'The Marquis of 絳 and the Marquis of 東陽 are called elders; these two people could not speak about matters, so how can this miser be a sly, quick-speaking person! Moreover, Qin appointed officials with knives and pens; officials competed to be quick and harsh, but their documents were just scribbles, lacking real compassion. Therefore, their faults were not heard, and they delayed until the second generation, when the world collapsed. Now Your Majesty uses the miser's speech to surpass, I fear the world will follow the wind and become chaotic, competing for speech without substance. And the lower-level changes to the upper-level are swift, and the mistakes must be examined.'"

But we need to keep Chinese names. So: "釋之 said: 'The Marquis of 絳, 周勃, and the Marquis of 東陽, 張相, are called elders; these two people could not speak about matters, so how can this miser be a sly, quick-speaking person!

"文帝曰：「善。」乃止不拜嗇夫。" -> "The emperor said: 'Good.' He then stopped and did not appoint the miser."

Ok.

上就車，召釋之參乘，徐行，問釋之秦之敝。具以質言。至宮，上拜釋之為公車令。

"上就車，召釋之參乘，徐行，問釋之秦之敝。具以質言。至宮，上拜釋之為公車令。" -> "The emperor took a carriage, summoned 釋之 to ride with him, and they walked slowly. He asked 釋之 about Qin's decline. 釋之 gave a detailed answer. Upon reaching the palace, the emperor appointed 釋之 as the official '公車令'."

Next paragraph:

頃之，太子與梁王共車入朝，不下司馬門，於是釋之追止太子、梁王無得入殿門。遂劾不下公門不敬，奏之。薄太后聞之，文帝免冠謝曰：「教兒子不謹。」薄太后乃使使承詔赦太子、梁王，然後得入。文帝由是奇釋之，拜為中大夫。

"頃之，太子與梁王共車入朝，不下司馬門，於是釋之追止太子、梁王無得入殿門。遂劾不下公門不敬，奏之。薄太后聞之，文帝免冠謝曰：「教兒子不謹。」薄太后乃使使承詔赦太子、梁王，然後得入。文帝由是奇釋之，拜為中大夫。"

Translate: "Soon, the Crown Prince and the King of 梁 rode together into the court, but did not go under the Sima Gate. Thus 釋之 chased them and prevented them from entering the hall. He then accused them of not going under the public gate and disrespect, and reported it. The empress dowager, upon hearing this, the emperor removed his hat and apologized, saying: 'I taught my son to be cautious.' The empress dowager then sent an envoy to accept the imperial decree to pardon the Crown Prince and the King of 梁, after which they were allowed to enter. The emperor, impressed by this, appointed 釋之 as a middle official."

But we need to keep names. So: "Soon, the Crown Prince and the King of 梁 rode together into the court, but did not go under the Sima Gate.

頃之，至中郎將。從行至霸陵，居北臨廁。是時慎夫人從，上指示慎夫人新豐道，曰：「此走邯鄲道也。」使慎夫人鼓瑟，上自倚瑟而歌，意慘悽悲懷，顧曰：「嗟乎！以北山石為槨，於此地之下，蕠漆其閒，無可動之。」左右皆曰：「善。」釋之前進曰：「使其中有可欲者，雖錮南山猶有郄；使其中無可欲者，雖無石槨，又何戚焉！」文帝稱善。其後拜釋之為廷尉。

This is a bit confusing. Let's translate.

"頃之，至中郎將。從行至霸陵，居北臨廁。是時慎夫人從，上指示慎夫人新豐道，曰：「此走邯鄲道也。」使慎夫人鼓瑟，上自倚瑟而歌，意慘悽悲懷，顧曰：「嗟乎！以北山石為槨，於此地之下，蕠漆其閒，無可動之。」左右皆曰：「善。」釋之前進曰：「使其中有可欲者，雖錮南山猶有郄；使其中無可欲者，雖無石槨，又何戚焉！」文帝稱善。其後拜釋之為廷尉。"

We need to parse. "頃之，至中郎將。從行至霸陵，居北臨廁。" -> "Soon, he reached the lieutenant general. He traveled to the burial mound of 霸, staying at the north side near the toilet." But "廁" maybe "bath" or "toilet." But maybe "廁" is a place. Hard to interpret. But we can translate literally: "He traveled to the burial mound of 霸, staying at the north side near the toilet." But maybe "廁" is a place name. We'll keep as "廁".

"是時慎夫人從，上指示慎夫人新豐道，曰：「此走邯鄲道也。」" -> "At that time, 慎夫人 followed. The emperor instructed 慎夫人 to take the new prosperous road, saying: 'This is the road to 邯鄲.'"

"使慎夫人鼓瑟，上自倚瑟而歌，意慘悽悲懷，顧曰：「嗟乎！以北山石為槨，於此地之下，蕠漆其閒，無可動之。」" -> "He made 慎夫人 play the zither, and he leaned on the zither and sang, with a sorrowful and melancholy feeling, looking back and saying: 'Alas! Using the stone of the North Mountain as a bench, beneath this place, the lacquer is in
