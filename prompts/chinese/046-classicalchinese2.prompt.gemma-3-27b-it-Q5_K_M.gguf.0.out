This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

## Translation, Moral, and Western Counterparts of the 荀子 Passage

Here's a breakdown of the passage from 荀子, addressing your requests:

**(1) Translation into English**

Lord Wei Wu of Wei was successful in his deliberations and decisions, surpassing all his ministers in ability. Upon retiring from court, he displayed a joyful expression. Wu Qi stepped forward and said, "Have you perhaps heard, through those around you, the words of King Zhuang of Chu?"

Lord Wei Wu asked, "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?"

Wu Qi replied, "When King Zhuang of Chu was successful in his deliberations and decisions, surpassing all his ministers in ability, he displayed a worried expression upon retiring from court. Shen Gong Wuchen stepped forward and asked, 'Your Majesty, why do you show worry after a successful court session?' King Zhuang replied, 'It is not because *Bu Gu* is capable in his deliberations and decisions, and all the ministers are unable to match him, that I worry. Rather, it is because of the words spoken within the Middle Kingdom: 'Those who gain teachers become kings, those who gain friends become hegemons, those who inspire doubt survive, and those who deliberate alone, with none comparable to them, perish!' Now, if *Bu Gu*, being unworthy, surpasses all the ministers, our kingdom is nearing ruin! That is why I worry.' King Zhuang of Chu worried, while Your Majesty rejoices."

Lord Wei Wu, humbled, bowed twice and said, "You, sir, have corrected my fault!" (literally: "You, sir, have shaken my inadequacy!")



**(2) Explanation of the Moral of the Story**

The moral of the story, as presented by Wu Qi, is a warning against relying too heavily on a single, exceptionally capable individual, even if that individual is effective in the short term.  It’s not about questioning competence, but about the *source* of that competence and its implications for the stability of the state. 

Here's a breakdown of the key points:

* **The Danger of Isolation:**  A ruler who finds himself consistently the only one capable of making good decisions, or who relies on a single advisor who consistently outshines everyone else, is creating a dangerous situation. It suggests a lack of talent and development within the broader court.
* **The Importance of Cultivating Talent:** The quote from the "Middle Kingdom" highlights the importance of building relationships – with teachers (learning from others), with friends (allies and collaborators), and even with those who offer constructive criticism (inspiring doubt, forcing self-reflection).  A strong state needs a network of capable individuals.
* **The Risk of Dependence:**  If the ruler becomes overly reliant on one person, the state becomes vulnerable. What happens if that person dies, becomes ill, or turns disloyal?  The entire system collapses.
* **Humility and Self-Reflection:**  King Zhuang’s worry isn’t about the success of the decision itself, but about *why* it was successful. He recognizes that his own court is weak if only one person can contribute effectively.  Lord Wei Wu’s willingness to accept Wu Qi’s correction demonstrates the importance of humility and self-reflection for a ruler.

Essentially, the story advocates for a holistic approach to governance, emphasizing the development of a capable and diverse court, rather than relying on the brilliance of a single individual.  It's a warning against creating a system where the ruler is the only one who can "get things done."



**(3) Counterparts in Western (European) Thought**

Yes, there are several counterparts to these concepts in Western thought, though they manifest in different ways:

* **Plato's Philosopher King & the Importance of Education:**  While Plato advocates for a ruler with superior wisdom (the Philosopher King), he also stresses the importance of *educating* the ruling class and the citizenry.  This is similar to the idea of cultivating talent throughout the court, rather than relying on a single genius.  Plato wouldn't approve of a situation where only one person understands the complexities of governance.
* **Aristotle's Polity & Mixed Constitution:** Aristotle believed the best form of government was a "polity" – a mixed constitution that combined elements of democracy and oligarchy. This was designed to balance the interests of different groups and prevent any single faction from gaining too much power.  This echoes the idea of a diverse and capable court, preventing the dominance of one individual.
* **Machiavelli's *The Prince* & the Need for Competent Advisors:** Machiavelli, while often seen as cynical, acknowledges the importance of surrounding oneself with capable advisors.  A prince needs to be able to delegate and rely on the expertise of others.  He warns against being seen as all-knowing, and recognizes the value of having advisors who can offer different perspectives.  However, Machiavelli's focus is more on practical effectiveness than on the moral implications of a weak court.
* **Montesquieu's Separation of Powers:**  Montesquieu's theory of the separation of powers (legislative, executive, judicial) is a direct attempt to prevent the concentration of power in the hands of a single individual or group.  This aligns with the story's warning against a ruler who is the only one capable of making decisions.
* **The Enlightenment Emphasis on Reason and Public Discourse:** The Enlightenment valued reason, debate, and public discourse as essential for good governance.  This implies a need for a well-informed and engaged citizenry, and a court capable of reasoned deliberation – again, contrasting with a situation where only one person understands the issues.

**In summary:** While the specific framing and cultural context differ, the core concerns expressed in the 荀子 passage – the dangers of concentrated power, the importance of cultivating talent, and the need for a balanced and diverse system of governance – resonate strongly with many themes in Western political thought.  The story serves as a timeless reminder that a strong state is built not on the brilliance of a single individual, but on the collective wisdom and capabilities of its people.
