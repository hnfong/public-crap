 (1) Translation:

The Duke of Wu was planning something and was pleased when his ministers couldn't guess it. After the court session, Wu Qi stepped forward and asked, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu from your attendants?" The Duke of Wu asked, "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?" Wu Qi replied, "King Zhuang of Chu was planning something and was worried when his ministers couldn't guess it. Shen Gong Wu, his minister, asked him, 'Why are you worried when you return from the court?' King Zhuang of Chu replied, 'When I don't plan anything but my ministers can't guess it, that's why I'm worried. As the saying goes, 'A ruler becomes a king if he acquires wise advisors, a hegemon if he acquires allies, survives if he arouses doubts, and perishes if he plans in secret without anyone else knowing. Now, my ministers can't guess my plans because I haven't made any, and our country is on the brink of perishing! That's why I'm worried.' King Zhuang of Chu worried, but you, my lord, are pleased." The Duke of Wu bowed twice and said, "Heaven has sent you, Master Wu, to correct my mistakes."

(2) Moral of the story:

The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should involve his ministers in decision-making and planning. Keeping plans and decisions secret from one's ministers is not a sign of intelligence or strength, but rather a sign of poor leadership that could lead to the downfall of the state. A ruler should value the input and advice of his ministers and work together with them for the betterment of the country.

(3) Counterpart in Western thought:

The concepts in the story can be found in Western (European) thought as well. For example, the idea of a ruler consulting with wise advisors can be seen in the works of ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. In Plato's Republic, the ideal ruler is a philosopher-king who is guided by wisdom and reason, and who consults with other wise individuals to make decisions for the good of the state. Similarly, Aristotle believed that a good ruler should be virtuous and should seek the advice of wise counselors. The concept of a ruler who keeps his plans secret and does not consult with his ministers is also criticized in Western literature, such as in Shakespeare's plays, where characters who rule in this way are often portrayed as tyrannical and ultimately unsuccessful.
