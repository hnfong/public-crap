The Biographies of Zhang Shi Zhi and Feng Tang

Zhang Shi Zhi, the Minister of Justice, was a native of Duyang, with the courtesy name Ji. He lived with his elder brother Zhong. He was appointed as a cavalry officer through his wealth, serving Emperor Xiao Wen. After ten years, he was not promoted and remained unknown. Shi Zhi said, "Being employed for a long time reduces my brother's fortune, and I am not succeeding." He wanted to resign and return home. Yuan Ang, the Middle General, knew of his virtue and regretted his departure, so he requested that Shi Zhi be transferred to become a court attendant. After the court session, Shi Zhi approached and spoke of matters of convenience. Emperor Wen said, "Speak humbly, do not speak of lofty matters, but make suggestions that can be implemented now." Thus, Shi Zhi spoke of the events between the Qin and Han dynasties, explaining why the Qin lost and the Han rose. Emperor Wen praised him, and he was appointed as the Chief of Court Attendants.

Shi Zhi accompanied the emperor on a trip and climbed the tiger enclosure. The emperor asked the park keeper about the records of various animals. The keeper was asked more than ten questions but could not answer. The keeper of the tiger enclosure stood by and answered the questions about the animals in detail, trying to show his ability to respond endlessly. The emperor said, "Shouldn't officials be like this? This keeper is useless!" He then ordered Shi Zhi to appoint the keeper as the park keeper. Shi Zhi stepped forward and said, "What do you think of Zhou Bo, the Marquis of Jiangling?" The emperor replied, "He is a man of virtue." He asked again, "What do you think of Zhang Xiang, the Marquis of Dongyang?" The emperor replied, "He is also a man of virtue." Shi Zhi said, "Both the Marquis of Jiangling and the Marquis of Dongyang are called men of virtue, yet they could not even speak out their thoughts. How could they be like this keeper, who is eloquent and quick-witted? In the past, the Qin relied on clerks who were good with legal documents, and officials competed to be harsh and strict. But this only produced formalities without genuine compassion. Thus, the Qin did not hear of their faults, and their decline led to the fall of the Second Emperor, and the empire collapsed. Now, if you promote this keeper for his eloquence, I fear that the people will follow suit, competing in eloquence without substance. Moreover, the people follow the example of the ruler faster than the echo follows the sound, so the actions must be carefully considered." Emperor Wen said, "Well said." He then stopped the appointment.

As the emperor got into the carriage, he summoned Shi Zhi to ride with him. As they drove slowly, the emperor asked about the problems of the Qin dynasty. Shi Zhi answered with all the facts. Upon reaching the palace, the emperor appointed Shi Zhi as the Director of Public Vehicles.

Soon after, the Crown Prince and Prince Liang rode together into court, not descending from their carriage at the司马门. Shi Zhi pursued and stopped them, forbidding them from entering the palace gate. He then charged them with disrespect for not descending from the gate and submitted the report. The Empress Dowager Bo heard of this, and Emperor Wen removed his hat and apologized, saying, "I did not teach my sons properly." The Empress Dowager then sent an envoy to convey the imperial decree to pardon the Crown Prince and Prince Liang, allowing them to enter. From then on, Emperor Wen regarded Shi Zhi as extraordinary and appointed him as a Middle Doctor.

Soon after, he became a Middle General. When accompanying the emperor to Baling, he was stationed north of the latrine. At that time, Princess Shenfu accompanied him. The emperor pointed to the new road to Xinfeng and said, "This is the road to Handan." He had Princess Shenfu play the se, and he himself leaned on the se and sang, his mood sad and melancholy. Looking at his ministers, he said, "Alas! If we use the stone of Beishan as the coffin, and wrap it with hemp and silk, and coat it with lacquer, could it be moved?" All around said, "Excellent." Shi Zhi stepped forward and said, "If there were something desirable inside, even if the mountain were sealed, there would still be a gap. If there were nothing desirable, even without a stone coffin, what would be the concern?" Emperor Wen praised him. Later, he appointed Shi Zhi as Minister of Justice.

Soon after, the emperor went out through the Zhong Wei Bridge. A man suddenly ran out from under the bridge, causing the emperor's horses to be startled. The emperor ordered cavalry to catch him and hand him over to the Minister of Justice. Shi Zhi questioned him. The man said, "I am a county resident. I heard the imperial procession and hid under the bridge. After a long time, I thought it had passed, so I came out. Seeing the emperor's carriage and guards, I ran away." The Minister of Justice ruled according to the law, stating that one who violated the imperial procession should be fined gold. Emperor Wen was angry, saying, "This man frightened my horses. My horses are gentle, but if they were other horses, they would surely have injured me! Yet the Minister of Justice only fines him gold!" Shi Zhi said, "Laws are shared by the emperor and the people. If the law is like this and we make it harsher, it will not be trusted by the people. If at that time, the emperor had ordered his immediate execution, it would have been fine. Now that he has been handed over to the Minister of Justice, who is the arbiter of the nation, if he tilts the scales, the whole nation will use the law with varying severity. How can the people know what to do? Please consider this carefully." After a long time, the emperor said, "The Minister of Justice is right."

Later, someone stole the jade rings in front of the temple of the former emperor. He was caught, and Emperor Wen was furious, ordering the Minister of Justice to handle the case. Shi Zhi applied the law, stating that stealing items from the imperial temple should be sentenced to death by public execution. Emperor Wen was extremely angry, saying, "How unrighteous! He stole the emperor's temple items. I gave him to the Minister of Justice to have him executed with his family, but you only apply the law. This is not how we should honor the imperial temple." Shi Zhi removed his hat and bowed, apologizing, "The law is sufficient as it is. Even if the crimes are equal, the severity should be based on the degree of rebellion. If we execute the thief of the imperial temple with his family, what if a foolish commoner took a clod of earth from Changling? What punishment would you give him?" After a long time, Emperor Wen spoke with the Empress Dowager, and they allowed the Minister of Justice to proceed with the sentence. At that time, the Inspector of the Capital, Zhou Yafu, and Wang Tiankai, the Marquis of Shandu, saw that Shi Zhi's judgment was fair, and they became close friends. The Minister of Justice was thus praised throughout the land.

After Emperor Wen died, Emperor Jing came to power, and Shi Zhi feared and claimed illness. He wanted to resign but feared severe punishment; he wanted to apologize but did not know how. Following Wang Sheng's advice, he finally apologized, and Emperor Jing did not punish him.

Wang Sheng was good at the teachings of Huang-Lao and was a recluse. Once summoned to the court, all the ministers gathered. Wang Sheng, an old man, said, "I need to tie my socks," and looked at the Minister of Justice, "Tie my socks for me!" Shi Zhi knelt and tied them. Someone then said to Wang Sheng, "Why did you publicly humiliate the Minister of Justice, making him kneel to tie your socks?" Wang Sheng replied, "I am old and lowly. I know I can bring no benefit to the Minister of Justice. The Minister of Justice is a famous minister of the nation. I humiliated him to make him kneel and tie my socks, to show him respect." The ministers heard this and thought Wang Sheng was virtuous and respected the Minister of Justice.

The Minister of Justice served Emperor Jing for over a year, becoming the Governor of Huainan, but still suffered from his past offense. Later, Shi Zhi died. His son was named Zhang Zhi, with the courtesy name Changgong, who reached the rank of Doctor but was dismissed. Because he could not flatter the world, he never held office again.

Feng Tang was originally from Zhao. His father moved to Dai. After the Han dynasty was established, his family moved to Anling. Feng Tang was known for his filial piety and served as the Director of the Middle Court, serving Emperor Wen. When Emperor Wen passed by, he asked Feng Tang, "Why did your father become a court officer? Where is your family?" Feng Tang answered truthfully. Emperor Wen said, "When I lived in Dai, my food supervisor Gao Qu often spoke of the virtue of General Li Qi of Zhao, who fought at Julu. Now, whenever I eat, I think of Julu. Do you know about this?" Feng Tang replied, "He is not as good as Lian Po or Li Mu." The emperor asked, "Why?" Feng Tang said, "My grandfather was a general in Zhao and was good with Li Mu. My father was the Governor of Dai and was good with General Li Qi of Zhao, and he knew his character." After hearing about Lian Po and Li Mu, the emperor was pleased and slapped his thigh, saying, "Alas! If only I could have Lian Po or Li Mu as my generals, how could I fear the Xiongnu!" Feng Tang said, "Your Majesty, even if you had Lian Po or Li Mu, you could not use them." The emperor was angry, stood up, and went into the palace. After a long time, he summoned Feng Tang and scolded him, "How could you publicly humiliate me? Don't you have a private place?" Feng Tang apologized, "I am a rustic who does not know the taboo."

At that time, the Xiongnu had recently invaded Chaona, killing the Governor of Beidi, Yang. The emperor was concerned about the Xiongnu, and he asked Feng Tang again, "How do you know I cannot use Lian Po or Li Mu?" Feng Tang replied, "I heard that ancient kings, when sending generals, would kneel and hand over the chariot, saying, 'Within the gate, I rule; outside the gate, the general rules.' Military rewards and promotions are decided outside, and reported upon return. This is not just talk. My grandfather said that Li Mu, as a general of Zhao, used the taxes from the military market to feed his soldiers, and rewards were decided outside, not disturbed by the court. He trusted and gave responsibility, so Li Mu could fully use his talents. He selected 1300 chariots, 13,000 cavalry, and 100,000 soldiers with gold, thus driving the Xiongnu north, defeating the Donghu, destroying the Danlin, repelling the powerful Qin, and supporting Han and Wei. At that time, Zhao nearly dominated. Later, when King Zhao Anqi came to power, his mother was a courtesan. King Zhao Anqi, under the influence of Guo Kai's slander, executed Li Mu and replaced him with Yan Ju. Thus, the army was defeated, and the soldiers fled, and Zhao was destroyed by Qin. I have heard that Wei Shang, the Governor of Yunzhong, used all the military market taxes to feed his soldiers, spending his own money, offering beef every five days to guests, officers, and servants. Thus, the Xiongnu avoided Yunzhong. When they once entered, Wei Shang led his cavalry to attack, killing many. The soldiers were all sons of farmers who left the fields to join the army. How could they know the military ranks? They fought all day, killing enemies and capturing prisoners, reporting to the command post, but if they said anything wrong, the civil officers would punish them according to the law. Rewards were not given, and the officials strictly enforced the law. I am foolish, but I think the emperor's laws are too strict, rewards too light, and punishments too heavy. Moreover, Wei Shang was punished for reporting six fewer enemy heads, and his rank was reduced, and he was ordered to serve as a laborer. From this, it is clear that even if you had Lian Po or Li Mu, you could not use them. I am foolish and have offended the taboo, but I am guilty of death!" Emperor Wen was pleased. That day, he sent Feng Tang with a ceremonial staff to pardon Wei Shang, reinstating him as Governor of Yunzhong, and appointed Feng Tang as the General of the Carriage and the Governor of the Capital and the Prefectures.

In the seventh year, Emperor Jing came to power, and Feng Tang was appointed as the Governor of Chu, but was dismissed. When Emperor Wu came to power, he sought virtuous men and recommended Feng Tang. Feng Tang was over ninety years old and could no longer serve as an official, so his son Feng Sui was appointed as a court officer. Sui's courtesy name was Wangsun, and he was also a remarkable man, who was good with me.

The Grand Historian said: The words of Zhang Ji reflect the virtue of a man of integrity, adhering to the law without bending to personal desires; the discussion of Feng Gong on generals is profound, indeed profound! As the saying goes, "If you do not know a man, look at his friends." The praises of these two men are worthy of being recorded in the imperial halls. The Book says, "Not partial, not partisan, the way of the king is broad; not partisan, not partial, the way of the king is smooth." Zhang Ji and Feng Gong were close to this. [end of text]
