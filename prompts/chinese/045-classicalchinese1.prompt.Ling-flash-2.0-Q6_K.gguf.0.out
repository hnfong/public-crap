**Q1: Give a short summary of the story (5 points)**  
Ximen Bao exposed the fraudulent "marriage to the river god" scheme perpetrated by local officials in Ye, where girls were forcibly taken and drowned under the guise of appeasing the river god. He feigned cooperation, then exposed and punished the corrupt priests and officials by drowning them instead. He then initiated public works, building canals to irrigate farmland, bringing lasting prosperity to the people.

**Q2: What kind of women were usually the victims in the story (2 points)**  
Young, unmarried girls deemed "beautiful" by the shamans, often from poor families, were selected as victims.

---

**Q3. Who were deemed to benefit from the old practice of offering girls? (2 points)**  
Local officials (three elders, court officers) and shamans, who embezzled funds meant for the "wedding" and lived off the remaining money.

**Q4: Did the protagonist use wits or force to deal with the situation? Explain (5 points)**  
The protagonist used **wit**. He pretended to cooperate with the ritual, then staged an elaborate charade to expose the fraud. By feigning dissatisfaction with the first girl and demanding replacements, he tricked the corrupt officials and shamans into revealing their guilt. He then had them executed (drowned) in place of the girls, turning their own scheme against them without resorting to direct violence.

**Q5: Was it moral for the protagonist to do so? Briefly provide views from various perspectives (10 points)**  
- **Utilitarian view**: Yes — he saved lives (girls) and brought long-term prosperity (irrigation), outweighing the short-term violence.  
- **Deontological view**: No — he used deception and extrajudicial killing, violating principles of justice and due process.  
- **Legalist view**: Yes — he upheld order by crushing corruption and superstition, restoring state authority.  
- **Feminist view**: Problematic — while saving girls, he still treated them as pawns and used violence; the root injustice (patriarchy, exploitation) was not addressed.  
- **Cultural relativist view**: In context, exposing deadly corruption and ending human sacrifice was morally justified despite harsh methods.

**Q6: At the end of 滑稽列传, it is said that: "傳曰：「子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。」三子之才能誰最賢哉？辨治者當能別之." Explain what it means, and whether the comment is fair. (15 points)**  
**Meaning**:  
The passage compares three ancient Chinese administrators:  
- **Zi Chan** (子产) governed Zheng such that people "could not deceive" him (strict, upright governance).  
- **Zi Jian** (子贱) governed Danfu such that people "could not bear to deceive" him (benevolent, virtuous leadership).  
- **Ximen Bao** (西门豹) governed Ye such that people "dared not deceive" him (fear-based, strict enforcement).  
It asks which of the three was most virtuous, suggesting discerning rulers can tell the difference.

**Fairness of the comment**:  
- **Fair**: The comment highlights different governance styles — integrity, benevolence, and authority — reflecting real-world political diversity. Ximen Bao’s methods were harsh but effective; his legacy endured through infrastructure and fear of retribution.  
- **Unfair**: It implies moral equivalence among different approaches. Zi Chan and Zi Jian ruled through virtue and trust, while Ximen relied on fear and violence. The comment may downplay the ethical cost of Ximen’s methods, especially extrajudicial killings, even if results were positive.  
**Conclusion**: The comment is insightful in recognizing varied leadership, but arguably unfair if it equates "effectiveness" with "virtue" without weighing means against ends. Ximen’s approach was arguably the least morally pure but most pragmatically transformative. [end of text]
