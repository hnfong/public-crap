This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

Here are the answers to your questions:

**(1) Translation:**

魏武侯 was discussing state affairs and making decisions that were all correct, and none of his ministers could match him. After the court session, he had a pleased expression. 吳起 approached him and said, "Have you ever heard the story of 楚莊王?" 武侯 asked, "What's the story of 楚莊王?" 吳起 replied, "楚莊王 was discussing state affairs and making decisions that were all correct, and none of his ministers could match him. After the court session, he had a worried expression. 申公巫臣 approached him and asked, 'Why do you look worried, Your Majesty?' 楚莊王 said, 'I am worried because I made decisions that were all correct, and none of my ministers could match me. According to the words of 中蘬, "A ruler who finds a worthy advisor will become a true king, one who finds a friend will become a hegemon, one who finds a doubter will survive, but one who relies solely on himself and has no one to match him will perish." Now, with my limited abilities, if none of my ministers can match me, our country is in danger of perishing! That's why I'm worried.' 楚莊王 was worried, but you, on the other hand, are pleased." 武侯 was taken aback, bowed twice, and said, "Heaven must have sent you to point out my mistakes."

**(2) Moral of the story:**

The moral of the story is that a ruler should be humble and recognize their own limitations. If a ruler is making decisions without any opposition or criticism from their ministers, it may be a sign of a lack of talented advisors or a lack of openness to different perspectives, which can ultimately lead to the downfall of the country. A wise ruler should be worried if they are not surrounded by capable and honest advisors who can provide constructive criticism and alternative viewpoints.

**(3) Counterpart in Western thought:**

The concept of the importance of surrounding oneself with wise and honest advisors is a common theme in Western thought. In ancient Greece, for example, the idea of "parrhesia" (παρρησία) referred to the practice of speaking truth to power, where advisors would provide frank and honest counsel to rulers. This concept was discussed by philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle.

In modern Western thought, the idea of surrounding oneself with diverse perspectives and encouraging constructive criticism is often referred to as "cognitive diversity" or "diversity of thought." This concept is rooted in the idea that a group of individuals with different backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives can make better decisions than a homogeneous group.

The story of 楚莊王 also resonates with the Western concept of the "iron law of oligarchy," which suggests that power tends to concentrate in the hands of a few individuals, leading to a lack of accountability and a decrease in the quality of decision-making. The story highlights the importance of having a system of checks and balances, where power is distributed among multiple individuals and groups, to prevent the concentration of power and ensure that decisions are made with the input of diverse perspectives.
