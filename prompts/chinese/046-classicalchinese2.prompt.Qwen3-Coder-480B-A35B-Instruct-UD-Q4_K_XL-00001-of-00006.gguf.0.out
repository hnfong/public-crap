## (1) English Translation

Duke Wu of Wei planned matters appropriately, and none of his ministers could match him. After court, he wore a pleased expression. Wu Qi approached and said: "Has Your Grace ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu?"

"What were King Zhuang of Chu's words?" asked the Duke.

Wu Qi replied: "King Zhuang of Chu planned matters appropriately, and none of his ministers could match him. Yet after court, he wore a worried expression. Minister Shen Xu approached and asked: 'Your Majesty, why do you look worried after court?' 

King Zhuang said: 'I planned matters appropriately, and none of my ministers could match me, which is why I am worried. As the saying goes in the Zhongluo region: "A feudal lord who finds teachers will become king; one who finds friends will becomeéœ¸ (hegemon); one who finds questioners will survive; one who plans alone with no equals will perish." Now, with my lack of virtue, and with no ministers able to match me, our state is close to perishing! That is why I am worried.'

"King Zhuang was worried, yet Your Grace is pleased."

Duke Wu looked around sheepishly and bowed twice, saying: "Heaven has sent you, Master, to correct my mistake."

## (2) Moral of the Story

The moral is about the dangers of intellectual isolation and the importance of surrounding oneself with capable advisors who can provide honest counsel. The story teaches that:

- **True wisdom lies in recognizing one's limitations**, not in pride over one's abilities
- **A leader's greatest danger is when no one can challenge or surpass them**, as this indicates a lack of capable talent
- **Humility and concern for good governance should outweigh personal pride** in one's achievements
- **Effective leadership requires seeking out and retaining talented people** who can serve as teachers, friends, and critics

The story emphasizes that a ruler who thinks they have no equals is actually in grave danger, while a ruler who worries about their lack of worthy ministers demonstrates wisdom and concern for their state's survival.

## (3) Western Counterparts

Yes, there are several counterparts in Western thought:

**Ancient Greek Philosophy:**
- **Socrates' "I know that I know nothing"** - the recognition that true wisdom begins with acknowledging one's ignorance
- **Plato's concept of the philosopher-king** who seeks wisdom and truth rather than personal glory

**Political Philosophy:**
- **Montesquieu's separation of powers** - built on the assumption that no individual should be trusted with absolute power
- **The Roman concept of "checks and balances"** in republican government
- **Aristotle's warning in Politics** about the dangers of tyranny and the importance of good counsel

**Modern Leadership Theory:**
- **Servant leadership** concepts that prioritize service over personal aggrandizement
- **Emotional intelligence** principles emphasizing self-awareness and humility
- **Organizational theory** about the importance of surrounding leaders with people who can challenge and improve their thinking

The story's core insight - that isolation from superior talent is a sign of weakness rather than strength - resonates strongly with Western democratic ideals about accountability, criticism, and the dangers of unchecked power. [end of text]
