**Q1: Summary of the story**  
Wu Liang (西门豹) becomes the new magistrate of Xiangdu (邺) and discovers that the people suffer due to a corrupt practice: the local officials bribe the river god (河伯) by offering young women, leaving the community impoverished. To stop this, Wu Liang tricks the old women by pretending to send them to the river, then executes them. He later builds irrigation channels to benefit the people, earning their loyalty.  

**Q2: Type of women usually victims**  
Young, attractive women, as the old women selected them for their beauty to "please the river god."  

**Q3: Who benefited from the practice**  
The local officials (三老、廷掾) and the river god (河伯), who received the bribes.  

**Q4: Wits or force?**  
Wu Liang used **wits** (cleverness) to expose the corruption and stop the practice without violence. He manipulated the old women’s beliefs and used psychological tactics (e.g., pretending to send them to the river) to achieve his goal.  

**Q5: Moral evaluation**  
- **Pro:** The practice was immoral (exploiting women, corruption). Wu Liang’s actions ended the suffering.  
- **Con:** Killing innocent women was unethical, even if the goal was good.  
- **Neutral:** The story highlights the need to challenge unjust systems, but the method raises ethical questions.  

**Q6: Explanation of the quote and fairness**  
The quote praises Wu Liang’s ability to "not deceive" the people, implying his governance was effective. However, the comment is **partially fair**:  
- **Fair:** His actions (ending the practice, building infrastructure) improved the people’s lives.  
- **Unfair:** The execution of women was extreme, and the quote may overlook the moral cost.  
The quote reflects the story’s focus on practical governance over strict morality. [end of text]
