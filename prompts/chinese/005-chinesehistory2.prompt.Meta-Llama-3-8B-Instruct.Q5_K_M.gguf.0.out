The fall of the Han Dynasty, which lasted for over 400 years, was a complex process involving multiple factors. Here are some of the key reasons that contributed to its downfall:

1. **Decline of the Imperial Court**: The Han Dynasty's imperial court became increasingly corrupt and inefficient, with emperors relying more on eunuchs and favorites rather than capable officials. This led to a breakdown in the administration of the empire and a decline in the quality of governance.
2. **Economic Decline**: The Han economy began to decline in the late 2nd century AD, due to a combination of factors such as over-reliance on silver currency, inflation, and a decline in agriculture. This led to widespread poverty and discontent among the population.
3. **Barbarian Invasions**: The Han Dynasty was beset by repeated invasions from various nomadic tribes, including the Xiongnu, the Xianbei, and the Jie. These invasions weakened the empire's military and forced the Han to divert resources away from internal development.
4. **Social Unrest**: The Han Dynasty experienced a series of peasant uprisings and rebellions, particularly in the late 2nd and early 3rd centuries AD. These rebellions were often sparked by economic hardship and social inequality.
5. **Overextension of the Empire**: The Han Dynasty's military campaigns and territorial expansion placed a significant strain on the empire's resources. The empire's vast borders were difficult to defend, and the constant wars with neighboring states and nomadic tribes drained the treasury and exhausted the population.
6. **Lack of Effective Leadership**: The Han Dynasty's emperors were often weak and ineffective, failing to address the growing problems facing the empire. This lack of leadership contributed to the decline of the empire's morale and cohesion.

In 220 AD, the Han Dynasty officially came to an end with the abdication of Emperor Xian. The empire was eventually divided into three separate kingdoms: Shu, Wu, and Wei, marking the beginning of the Three Kingdoms period in Chinese history.
