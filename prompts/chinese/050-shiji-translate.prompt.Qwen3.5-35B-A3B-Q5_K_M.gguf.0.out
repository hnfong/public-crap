《Biography of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang》

Zhang Tingwei Shizhi was from Duyang, courtesy name Ji. He had an elder brother named Zhong with whom he lived. Using his wealth, he became a Cavalry Attendant, serving Emperor Xiaowen. For ten years he received no promotion and was unknown. Shizhi said, "Serving long has diminished my brother's estate; I cannot continue." He wished to resign and return. Yuan Ang, the Commandant of the Palace, knowing his worth, regretted his departure and requested to transfer Shizhi to the position of Attendant. After Shizhi finished his morning audience, he then spoke of matters suitable for the present. The Emperor said, "Speak plainly, do not offer lofty theories; make it something that can be implemented now." Thus Shizhi spoke of matters between Qin and Han, of why Qin lost and why Han rose, for a long time. The Emperor praised him and appointed Shizhi as Attendant Commandant.

Shizhi accompanied the Emperor on a tour, ascending the Tiger Pen. The Emperor asked the Forester of the Upper Forest about the registers of birds and beasts. Asked over ten questions, the Forester looked left and right, unable to answer. The Tax Collector of the Tiger Pen, standing nearby, answered the Emperor's questions about the Upper Forest registers in great detail, wishing to demonstrate his ability to respond instantly and endlessly. The Emperor said, "Should officials not be like this? The Forester is useless!" He then ordered Shizhi to appoint the Tax Collector as the Commandant of the Upper Forest. Shizhi approached slowly and said, "Your Majesty, what kind of person was Zhou Bo, the Marquis of Jianghou?" The Emperor said, "A man of virtue." He asked again, "What kind of person was Zhang Xianghe, the Marquis of Dongyang?" The Emperor again said, "A man of virtue." Shizhi said, "Zhou Bo and Zhang Xianghe are called men of virtue; yet these two could not speak a word on matters. How could they learn from this Tax Collector's glib and quick-tongued eloquence? Moreover, Qin relied on clerks who competed in speed and harsh scrutiny, but their flaw was merely formal documents, lacking genuine compassion. Thus their faults were never heard of, and they declined until the Second Emperor, when the empire collapsed. Now Your Majesty, because of the Tax Collector's eloquence, promotes him beyond his station. I fear the world will follow this trend, competing in eloquence without substance. Moreover, the people's transformation by their superiors is faster than shadow and echo; actions must be carefully considered." The Emperor said, "Well." He then stopped the appointment of the Tax Collector.

The Emperor boarded his carriage, summoned Shizhi to ride beside him, and walked slowly, asking Shizhi about the faults of Qin. Shizhi answered with plain truth. Upon reaching the palace, the Emperor appointed Shizhi as Commandant of the Public Carriages.

Soon after, the Crown Prince and the King of Liang rode together in a carriage to the court and did not dismount at the Sima Gate. Shizhi pursued and stopped them, preventing them from entering the palace gate. He then impeached them for not dismounting at the public gate, showing disrespect, and submitted the report. When Empress Dowager Bo heard of this, Emperor Xiaowen removed his cap and apologized, saying, "I failed to educate my sons carefully." Empress Dowager Bo then sent an envoy to convey the imperial decree pardoning the Crown Prince and the King of Liang, after which they were allowed to enter. From this, Emperor Xiaowen regarded Shizhi as extraordinary and appointed him as Grand Master.

Soon after, he became Commandant of the Palace. Accompanying the Emperor to Baling, they stood on the north side overlooking the grave. At that time, Lady Shen accompanied them. The Emperor pointed to the road to Xinfeng and said, "This is the road to Handan." He had Lady Shen play the se, and the Emperor himself leaned on the se and sang, his expression filled with sorrow and grief. He turned to the courtiers and said, "Alas! If we use the stones of Beishan for the outer coffin, and pack it with hemp and silk, and seal it with lacquer, how could it be disturbed!" Those around all said, "Well." Shizhi stepped forward and said, "If there is desire within, even if the southern mountains were chained, there would still be gaps; if there is no desire within, even without a stone coffin, what need for worry!" The Emperor praised him. Later, Shizhi was appointed as Tingwei.

Soon after, the Emperor went out to the middle of the Wei Bridge. A man emerged from under the bridge, startling the Emperor's horses. The Emperor ordered cavalry to arrest him and handed him over to the Tingwei. Shizhi investigated and questioned him. The man said, "I am a county resident. Hearing the imperial procession, I hid under the bridge. After a long time, thinking the procession had passed, I came out, saw the imperial carriage and cavalry, and ran." The Tingwei Qin sentenced him: one who violates the imperial procession should be fined. The Emperor was angry and said, "This man startled my horses. If my horses had not been gentle, another horse would surely have caused me injury! Yet the Tingwei only sentenced him to a fine!" Shizhi said, "The law is what the Emperor shares with the world. If the law is thus and we make it heavier, the law will not be trusted by the people. Moreover, at that time, if the Emperor had ordered immediate execution, it would have been done. Now that it has been handed to the Tingwei, the Tingwei is the balance of the world. If one side tilts, all laws throughout the world will become light or heavy; where will the people place their hands? I beg Your Majesty to consider this." After a long time, the Emperor said, "The Tingwei's judgment is correct."

Later, someone stole the jade ring in front of the hall of the High Ancestor. He was captured. The Emperor was angry and ordered the Tingwei to investigate. Shizhi consulted the law regarding theft of ancestral temple garments and objects and submitted a report, recommending death by public execution. The Emperor was furious and said, "Such a person is without reason, stealing the vessels of the Late Emperor. I handed him to the Tingwei hoping to have him executed in his clan, yet you report according to the law; this is not my intention in honoring the ancestral temple." Shizhi removed his cap, bowed his head to the ground, and apologized, saying, "The law is sufficient as it is. Moreover, crimes are equal, but the degree depends on the nature of the act. If we execute the clan for stealing the temple vessel, and if by chance a foolish peasant were to take a handful of earth from Changling, what law could Your Majesty add to punish him?" After a long time, the Emperor discussed this with the Empress Dowager, and then agreed to the Tingwei's judgment. At that time, Zhongwei, the Marquis of Tiaohou, Zhou Yafu, and the Chancellor of Liang, the Marquis of Shandu, Wang Tiankai, saw that Shizhi judged fairly and became his close friends. Thus, Zhang Tingwei was praised throughout the world.

After Emperor Xiaowen passed away, Emperor Jing ascended the throne. Shizhi was afraid, claiming illness. He wished to resign, fearing great punishment; he wished to appear and apologize, but did not know how. Following Wang Sheng's advice, he finally appeared and apologized. Emperor Jing did not punish him.

Wang Sheng was skilled in the teachings of Huang-Lao and was a recluse. Once summoned to the court, the Three Excellencies and Nine Ministers were all standing. Wang Sheng, an old man, said, "My garter is loose," and turned to Zhang Tingwei, saying, "Tie my garter for me!" Shizhi knelt and tied it. Afterwards, someone said to Wang Sheng, "Why did you humiliate Zhang Tingwei, making him kneel to tie your garter?" Wang Sheng said, "I am old and lowly; I know I can never benefit Zhang Tingwei. Zhang Tingwei is now a famous minister of the world; I merely humiliated him slightly, making him kneel to tie my garter, to honor him." When the officials heard this, they esteemed Wang Sheng and honored Zhang Tingwei.

Zhang Tingwei served Emperor Jing for over a year, then became the Chancellor of the King of Huainan, still bearing the previous offense. After a long time, Shizhi died. His son was Zhang Zhi, courtesy name Changgong, who rose to the rank of Grand Master but was dismissed. Because he could not please the world, he never held office again.

Feng Tang's grandfather was from Zhao. His father moved to Dai. When Han was founded, they moved to Anling. Tang was known for his filial piety and became the Chief of the Palace Attendants, serving Emperor Xiaowen. One day, the Emperor's carriage passed by and asked Tang, "Old man, why did you become an attendant? Where is your home?" Tang answered truthfully. The Emperor said, "When I was in Dai, my Food Supervisor, Gao Qu, often spoke to me of the excellence of Zhao's general Li Qi, who fought at Julu. Now, every time I eat, my mind is always at Julu. Do you know of him?" Tang replied, "He is not as good as Lian Po or Li Mu as generals." The Emperor asked, "Why?" Tang said, "My grandfather, when in Zhao, served as a commander and was good friends with Li Mu. My father was formerly the Chancellor of Dai and was good friends with Zhao's general Li Qi, knowing his character." After hearing about Lian Po and Li Mu, the Emperor was greatly pleased and clapped his thighs, saying, "Alas! If only I could have Lian Po or Li Mu as my generals, would I not worry about the Xiongnu!" Tang said, "Your Majesty! Even if you had Lian Po or Li Mu, you could not use them." The Emperor became angry, rose, and entered the inner palace. After a long time, he summoned Tang and rebuked him, saying, "Why did you humiliate me in front of everyone? Is there no private place?" Tang apologized, saying, "I am a vulgar person and did not know the taboos."

At that time, the Xiongnu had recently invaded Chaona, killing the Commandant of Beidi, Ang. The Emperor was concerned about the Hu invaders and finally asked Tang again, "How do you know I cannot use Lian Po or Li Mu?" Tang replied, "I have heard that in ancient times, when kings sent out generals, they knelt and pushed the carriage wheel, saying, 'Within the gate, I control; outside the gate, the general controls. Military merit and rewards are decided outside; upon return, they are reported. This is not empty talk. My grandfather said that when Li Mu was the general of Zhao at the border, the rent from the military market was used entirely to feed the soldiers; rewards were decided outside, without interference from the center. He was entrusted with success, so Li Mu could fully use his intelligence, sending out 1,300 chariots, 13,000 cavalry, and 100,000 elite soldiers. Thus he drove back the Xiongnu, defeated the Donghu, destroyed the Danlin, suppressed the strong Qin in the west, and held back Han and Wei in the south. At that time, Zhao was nearly hegemonic. Later, when King Qian of Zhao ascended, his mother was a courtesan. When King Qian ascended, he used Guo Kai's slander and eventually executed Li Mu, appointing Yan Ju in his place. Thus the army was defeated and the soldiers fled, and they were captured and destroyed by Qin. Now I secretly hear that Wei Shang was the Governor of Yunzhong; he used all the rent from the military market to feed the soldiers, and even used his private money to feed them. Every five days he slaughtered a cow to entertain guests, military officers, and household members. Thus the Xiongnu stayed far away, not approaching the Yunzhong pass. Once the enemy entered, Shang led his chariots and cavalry to attack them, killing many. The soldiers are all sons of common families, rising from the fields to join the army; how could they know the detailed records and ranks? All day they fought bravely, beheading enemies and capturing prisoners, reporting their achievements to the headquarters. If one word did not match, clerks would punish them according to the law. Their rewards were not given, but the law was strictly enforced by the clerks. I am foolish, but I believe Your Majesty's law is too clear, rewards too light, and punishments too heavy. Moreover, the Governor of Yunzhong, Wei Shang, was punished because his report of enemy heads was off by six. Your Majesty handed him to the officials, stripped his title, and sentenced him to labor. From this, I say that even if you had Lian Po or Li Mu, you could not use them. I am truly foolish, violating taboos; I deserve death, death!" The Emperor was pleased. That day, he ordered Feng Tang to hold the imperial seal and pardon Wei Shang, restoring him as Governor of Yunzhong, and appointed Tang as Commandant of the Cavalry, in charge of the Commandant of the Capital and the cavalry of the commanderies and kingdoms.

In the seventh year, Emperor Jing ascended the throne and appointed Tang as Chancellor of Chu, then dismissed him. When Emperor Wu ascended, he sought worthy men and recommended Feng Tang. Tang was over ninety years old and could not serve again, so his son, Feng Sui, was appointed as an Attendant. Sui's courtesy name was Wangsun; he was also an extraordinary man and was my friend.

The Grand Historian says: Zhang Ji's words about men of virtue show that he followed the law without yielding to opinion; Feng Gong's discussion of generals is profound! Profound! The saying goes, "If you do not know a person, look at his friends." The words of these two gentlemen can be inscribed in the halls of state. The Book says, "Without bias or faction, the royal way is vast; without faction or bias, the royal way is smooth." Zhang Ji and Feng Gong were close to this. [end of text]
