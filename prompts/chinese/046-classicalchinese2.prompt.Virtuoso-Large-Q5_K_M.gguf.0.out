### (1) Translation of the Story into English

Wei Wu Hou (魏武侯) was discussing matters and made a correct decision, which none of his ministers could match. After the court session, he had a pleased expression. Wu Qi (吳起) approached and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu (楚莊王) as recounted by those around him?" Wu Hou replied, "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?" Wu Qi responded, "King Zhuang of Chu was discussing matters and made a correct decision, which none of his ministers could match. After the court session, he had a worried expression. Shen Gong Wu Chen (申公巫臣) approached and asked, 'Why do you look worried after the court session?' King Zhuang replied, 'I made a correct decision, and none of my ministers could match it, which is why I am worried. As it is said by Zhong Gao (中蘬), "Those who can find a teacher among the feudal lords will become kings; those who can find a friend will become hegemonic; those who can find someone to question them will survive; those who plot on their own and think no one can match them will perish." Now, with my lack of ability, none of my ministers can match me, so our state is close to ruin! That is why I am worried.' King Zhuang of Chu was worried, while you are pleased." Wu Hou hesitated and then bowed twice, saying, "The heavens have sent you to correct my mistake."

### (2) Explanation of the Moral of the Story

The moral of the story is that true wisdom and leadership involve recognizing one's own limitations and the value of having advisors who can challenge and improve upon one's decisions. King Zhuang of Chu's worry stems from the realization that if he is the only one making correct decisions, it indicates a lack of capable advisors, which is a sign of potential downfall. In contrast, Wei Wu Hou's initial pleasure at being the best decision-maker shows a lack of self-awareness and a potential overconfidence, which can lead to complacency and poor governance. The story emphasizes the importance of humility, self-reflection, and the need for diverse and critical input in leadership.

### (3) Counterpart in Western (European) Thought

The concepts in this story have several counterparts in Western (European) thought, particularly in the realms of philosophy, leadership, and governance. Here are a few examples:

1. **Socratic Method**: Socrates, the ancient Greek philosopher, was known for his method of questioning to stimulate critical thinking and to expose the flaws in one's reasoning. The idea that a leader should be open to being questioned and challenged is similar to the Socratic method, which emphasizes the importance of dialogue and critical examination.

2. **Aristotle's Virtue Ethics**: Aristotle's concept of the "Golden Mean" suggests that virtue lies in the balance between excess and deficiency. In the context of leadership, this means that a leader should avoid the extremes of overconfidence and excessive humility. The story of King Zhuang of Chu and Wei Wu Hou illustrates the importance of finding this balance.

3. **Plato's Philosopher-King**: In Plato's "Republic," the ideal ruler is a philosopher-king who possesses both wisdom and the ability to govern justly. The story highlights the importance of wisdom and the recognition of one's own limitations, which are key attributes of a philosopher-king.

4. **Machiavelli's "The Prince"**: While Machiavelli's advice is often seen as pragmatic and sometimes ruthless, he also emphasizes the importance of a ruler having wise counselors and being open to their advice. The story's emphasis on the need for capable advisors and the dangers of overconfidence aligns with Machiavelli's views on effective leadership.

5. **Modern Leadership Theories**: Contemporary leadership theories, such as transformational leadership and servant leadership, also stress the importance of humility, self-awareness, and the ability to listen to and learn from others. These theories advocate for leaders who are not only decisive but also open to feedback and continuous improvement.

In summary, the story's themes of humility, self-reflection, and the value of diverse input are well-represented in various strands of Western thought, from ancient philosophy to modern leadership theories. [end of text]
