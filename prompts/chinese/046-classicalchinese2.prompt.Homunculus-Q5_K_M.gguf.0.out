### (1) **Translation of the Passage into English**

**Wei Wu Hou** (King Wu of Wei) was planning a military campaign and succeeded, but none of his ministers could understand his strategy. After the court session, he looked pleased. **Wu Qi** (a minister) said:  
> "Has there ever been a time when the words of **Zhuang Wang of Chu** were heard by those around him?"

**Wei Wu Hou** asked:  
> "What did Zhuang Wang of Chu say?"

**Wu Qi** replied:  
> "Zhuang Wang of Chu planned a campaign and succeeded, but none of his ministers could understand his strategy. After the court session, he looked worried. **Shang Gong Wu** (a minister) asked:  
> 'Why does Your Majesty look worried?'
> Zhuang Wang said:  
> 'It is because I planned the campaign and succeeded, but none of my ministers could understand my strategy. That is why I am worried. The saying goes:  
> "Those who consider themselves wise will be kings, those who consider themselves friends will be tyrants, those who are suspicious will survive, and those who plan on their own and think no one can surpass them will be destroyed."  
> Now, since I am not wise, and yet my ministers cannot understand my plans, how can our country not be in danger? That is why I am worried.'  
> Zhuang Wang was worried, but Your Majesty is pleased."

**Wei Wu Hou** bowed deeply and said:  
> "You, sir, have corrected my mistake."

### (2) **Moral of the Story**

The moral of the story is that **true wisdom lies in humility and self-awareness**, not in arrogance or overconfidence. Zhuang Wang of Chu understood that if he succeeded in his plans but no one else could understand them, it was a sign of danger — not because he was wrong, but because he was too isolated in his thinking. He feared that his lack of wisdom and the inability of his ministers to grasp his plans could lead to the downfall of the state.

In contrast, **Wei Wu Hou** was pleased with himself, not realizing that his own lack of wisdom and the inability of his ministers to understand his plans might also lead to disaster. Wu Qi's warning reminds him that **true leadership requires humility, openness to counsel, and the ability to share one's vision with others**.

### (3) **Counterpart in Western Thought**

Yes, the concepts in this story have strong parallels in **Western political and philosophical thought**, particularly in the ideas of **leadership, wisdom, and the dangers of overconfidence**.

#### Key Parallels:

1. **The Danger of Overconfidence (Arrogance)**  
   - In Western philosophy, especially in **Stoicism** and **Classical Realism**, there is a strong emphasis on **self-awareness** and **humility**. For example, **Seneca** and **Marcus Aurelius** often warned against overestimating one's own wisdom and underestimating the value of counsel.
   - The idea that **"those who think they are wise will be kings"** is similar to the Stoic warning that **"the wise man is humble, not arrogant."**

2. **The Value of Counsel and Shared Understanding**  
   - In **Aristotelian ethics**, the idea that a leader should be open to counsel and not act in isolation is central. Aristotle emphasized that **good governance requires dialogue and shared understanding**.
   - The **"wise ruler"** in Western thought is often portrayed as one who **listens to others**, not just one who acts alone.

3. **The Paradox of Success**  
   - The story reflects a **paradox of success**: success in isolation can be a sign of weakness, not strength. This is similar to the **"hubris"** concept in Greek tragedy — where a leader's overconfidence leads to downfall.
   - In **Machiavellian thought**, there is a similar idea that **a leader must appear strong but also be able to adapt and listen**.

4. **The Role of the Advisor**  
   - The role of **Wu Qi** as the advisor who corrects the king is reminiscent of the **"wise advisor"** in Western literature, such as **Achilles' advisor Odysseus** or **Solomon's courtiers** in the Bible.

### Summary

- **Translation**: The story tells of King Wu of Wei, who is pleased after a successful military campaign, but his minister Wu Qi reminds him of the story of King Zhuang of Chu, who was worried after a similar success because he feared his isolation from his ministers.
- **Moral**: True wisdom lies in humility and openness to counsel, not in overconfidence or isolation.
- **Western Parallel**: The story reflects ideas found in **Stoicism**, **Aristotelian ethics**, and **Classical Realism**, particularly the dangers of arrogance, the value of shared understanding, and the role of the wise advisor.
