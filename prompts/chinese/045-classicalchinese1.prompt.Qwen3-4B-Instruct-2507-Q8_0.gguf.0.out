**Q1: Short summary (5 points)**  
West Men (Xīmén Bào) became the magistrate of Yè. He discovered that local elders, witches, and officials annually forced poor families to send girls to be drowned in the river as offerings to the river god. To expose the fraud, he pretended to send a girl to the river, then had the witch and elders thrown into the river. After showing force, he convinced the people that the practice was absurd and immoral. He then led the people to build twelve canals to irrigate farmland, bringing lasting prosperity. The people came to respect his authority and never again engaged in the false ritual.

**Q2: Kind of women (2 points)**  
Poor, young, and ordinary village girls—especially those from lower-income families who were considered "beautiful" by the witches.

---

**Q3: Who benefited? (2 points)**  
The local elders, officials, and witch priests—especially those who took money from the people and shared it among themselves.

---

**Q4: Wits or force? (5 points)**  
West Men used **force** to end the practice. He did not negotiate or persuade directly. Instead, he staged a dramatic scene by throwing the witch and elders into the river, showing that the ritual was meaningless and fraudulent. This forceful action shocked the people and made them realize the deception. While it may seem harsh, it was effective and immediate. His use of force was not random—it was a calculated, symbolic act to break the superstition and restore rational governance.

**Q5: Was it moral? (10 points)**  
- **From a utilitarian view**: Yes—ending the cruel ritual saved lives and brought long-term prosperity. The moral benefit outweighed the cost.  
- **From a human rights view**: Yes—girls were exploited and abused; ending the practice protected vulnerable women.  
- **From a Confucian view**: Mixed—Confucianism values harmony and ritual, but West Men broke a tradition through force. However, he restored social order and justice, which aligns with moral governance.  
- **From a legal or ethical perspective**: The act may seem unjust or violent, especially to innocent women. Some might argue it was excessive or dehumanizing.  
- **Overall**: While the method was harsh, the outcome was just and beneficial. The moral justification lies in ending systemic cruelty and restoring rationality over superstition.

**Q6: Meaning and fairness of the quote (15 points)**  
The quote says: *"Zǐchǎn governed Zheng, people couldn’t deceive him; Zǐjiàn governed Shànfù, people couldn’t be deceived; Xīmén Bào governed Yè, people couldn’t *be* deceived."*  
- It compares three wise rulers:  
  - **Zǐchǎn** (Zichan): People couldn’t *deceive* him—his rule was fair and transparent.  
  - **Zǐjiàn** (Zijian): People *couldn’t be* deceived—his rule was compassionate and humane.  
  - **Xīmén Bào**: People *couldn’t* be deceived—his rule was so strong and authoritative that people feared breaking it.  
- The comment suggests that each ruler used a different method: wisdom, compassion, or authority.  
- **Is it fair?** Yes—each method reflects a different kind of governance.  
  - Zichan: wisdom and fairness.  
  - Zijian: compassion and empathy.  
  - Xīmén Bào: authority and fear-based deterrence.  
- While Xīmén Bào’s method is harsh, it was effective in ending a harmful tradition. In a society where superstition and corruption were rampant, his forceful action was necessary.  
- Thus, the comment is fair—it acknowledges different styles of governance, each with merit depending on context.  
- It reflects the *Hájī Lièzhuàn*’s theme: humor and irony in governance—sometimes, the most effective rulers are those who use bold, even shocking, actions to correct injustice. [end of text]
