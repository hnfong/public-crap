This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

## Translation and Analysis of the Xunzi Passage

**(1) Translation:**

Duke Wu of Wei was planning a strategy, and when it was successful, none of his ministers could match his insight. After the court session, he wore a look of joy. Wu Qi stepped forward and said, "Have you ever heard the words of Duke Huan of Chu from those around him?" Duke Wu replied, "What were the words of Duke Huan of Chu?" Wu Qi answered, "Duke Huan of Chu, when his plans succeeded and his ministers couldn't keep up, would retire from court with a worried expression. Shen Gong, the minister Wu Chen, approached him and asked, 'Your Majesty, why the worried expression after a successful court session?' Duke Huan replied, 'It's because my plans succeeded, yet none of my ministers could understand them. This is what the saying goes: "Those who gain wise advisors become kings, those who gain allies become hegemons, those who gain suspicion perish, and those who plan alone and have no one to match their wisdom will be destroyed." Now, because of my own inadequacy, my ministers cannot keep up with me. This means my country is in danger of perishing! That is why I am worried.' Duke Huan of Chu worried, while you, my lord, rejoice." Duke Wu was silent for a moment, then bowed twice and said, "Master Wu Qi, you have pointed out my shortcomings."

**(2) Moral of the Story:**

The story highlights the importance of **collective wisdom and shared understanding** in governance. While individual brilliance is valuable, a ruler should be concerned if their ministers cannot grasp their strategies. This suggests that a wise leader fosters an environment where advisors can contribute, challenge, and ultimately help refine the ruler's vision.

The story also emphasizes the **danger of isolation and unchecked power**. Duke Huan's worry stems from the realization that his unique insight, if not shared and understood, could lead to the downfall of his kingdom. This warns against the pitfalls of relying solely on one's own judgment and neglecting the collective intelligence of advisors.

**(3) Counterparts in Western Thought:**

The concepts in this story resonate with several ideas in Western thought:

* **Plato's Philosopher-King:** Plato argued for a ruler who possesses wisdom and knowledge, but also emphasizes the importance of surrounding oneself with wise advisors. The philosopher-king should not rule alone but engage in dialogue and deliberation with others.
* **Aristotle's Politics:** Aristotle believed that good governance requires a balance between the rule of one (monarchy) and the rule of many (democracy). He advocated for a mixed constitution that incorporates elements of both, recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of each system.
* **Machiavelli's The Prince:** While Machiavelli is often associated with pragmatism and cunning, he also stresses the importance of understanding the strengths and weaknesses of one's advisors. A wise prince, according to Machiavelli, should be able to discern good counsel from bad and utilize advisors effectively.

The Xunzi passage, while rooted in Chinese Confucian thought, shares common ground with these Western philosophical ideas, highlighting the universal importance of collective wisdom, shared understanding, and the dangers of unchecked power in governance.
