This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

(1) Translation: 

When the Prime Minister of the state of Qin, named Wu Qi, saw the expression of joy on the face of the Qin general, Lord Bai, after the general had returned from the royal court, he asked him about it. Lord Bai said that he had heard that the King of Chu had a saying that went like this: "When a ruler is good at planning and executing affairs, his ministers cannot catch up with him, and when he returns from the court, he looks worried. It is because he is worried that his ministers cannot keep up with his plans, and he fears that his state will perish. Now, I hear that in our Qin state, the ministers cannot keep up with your plans and actions, so I am happy." Lord Bai then made a deep bow and said, "Heaven has sent the wise man to correct my mistakes."

(2) Moral of the story: The story teaches the importance of a ruler being cautious and wary of their own limitations and those of their ministers, and to seek guidance from wise individuals to avoid downfall.

(3) Counterpart in Western thought: The concepts in the story, such as the need for a ruler to be cautious and seek guidance, can be seen as similar to the importance of wisdom and humility in leadership as discussed in Western thought. Examples include the ideas of "humility and the fear of God" as a foundation for good leadership, or the idea of seeking counsel from trusted advisors. These concepts emphasize the need for leaders to recognize their own limitations and to seek wisdom from others.<|im_end|>
