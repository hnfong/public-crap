Okay, I have to answer these questions based on the given text from "滑稽列传." Let me go through each question step by step.

Q1: Summary of the story (5 points)
The text is a recount of a historical event involving魏文侯 and西门豹. It describes their interactions, the events that led to the decline of the city, and the conclusion that they were not贤. So the summary should capture the main events and the outcome.

Q2: Type of women victims (2 points)
From the text, it mentions河伯娶妇， so the victims were women who were typically married to a river伯， meaning they were typically poor or vulnerable.

Q3: Who benefited from offering girls?
The text says that when the巫 (a old女子) was involved, they were treated harshly. It mentions that the women were often taken and had to be left. So perhaps the old practice of offering girls was not beneficial to them but led to their suffering.

Q4: Did they use wits or force? Explain (5 points)
The text shows that they used force by sending弟子 and making decisions without considering the long-term effects. They used force to get their desired outcome, so they did use force.

Q5: Moral aspect (10 points)
The moral is that they used force without considering the long-term consequences, leading to the city's decline. It's moral to question the ethical use of power and force.

Q6: Comment on the comment about "传" and whether fair (15 points)
The comment refers to three men's treatments. The text says they were treated harshly, so the comment is fair but points out the moral issue.

Now, I need to provide concise answers as per the user's instructions.
