The "Liezhuan of 張釋之 and 馮唐"

The Commandant of Justice 張釋之 was a man of 堵陽, his courtesy name was 季. He had an elder brother named 仲 with whom he lived. Because of his wealth, he became a Cavalry Gentleman and served 孝文帝. For ten years he was not promoted, and he was not known for anything. 釋之 said: "Being an official for a long time reduces 仲's property, it is not successful." He wanted to resign and return home. the General of the Gentlemen of the Center 袁盎 knew his worth and regretted his departure, so he requested to transfer 釋之 to fill the post of Receptionist. After 釋之 had finished the court audience, he took the opportunity to speak about matters of convenience. 文帝 said: "Lower your discourse, do not speak too loftily, make it so it can be implemented now." Thereupon 釋之 spoke of the events between 秦 and 漢, why 秦 lost its power and 漢 rose, for a long time. 文帝 praised it as good, and thereupon appointed 釋之 as the Chief of the Receptionists.

釋之 accompanied the Emperor on an excursion and climbed to the Tiger Enclosure. The Emperor asked the Superintendent of the Shanglin Park about the registers of the various birds and beasts. He asked more than ten questions, but the Superintendent looked left and right and could not answer a single one. The Keeper of the Tiger Enclosure, standing by, answered for the Superintendent regarding the questions the Emperor asked about the beast registers very thoroughly, wishing to show off his ability to answer verbally and respond endlessly. 文帝 said: "Should an official not be like this? The Superintendent is useless!" He then ordered 釋之 to appoint the Keeper as the Prefect of Shanglin. 釋之 stepped forward after a long while and said: "What does Your Majesty think of the Marquis of 絳, 周勃?" The Emperor said: "An elder." He asked again: "What do you think of the Marquis of 東陽, 張相如?" The Emperor again said: "An elder." 釋之 said: "The Marquis of 絳 and the Marquis of 東陽 are called elders, yet these two men when speaking of affairs could not even get the words out of their mouths; how could they teach this Keeper to be glib of tongue and quick of reply! Moreover, 秦 employed officials who wielded knives and brushes, and the officials strove to outdo each other in being harsh and scrutinizing, yet the corruption of this was that it was merely on paper, without the reality of compassion. Therefore, their faults were not heard of, and they declined gradually until the Second Emperor, when the world collapsed like earth. Now if Your Majesty promotes this Keeper because of his glib tongue, I fear the world will follow this trend and strive for glib tongues without substance. Moreover, the influence of those below upon those above is faster than shadows or echoes; actions must not be taken without careful consideration." 文帝 said: "Good." Thereupon he stopped and did not appoint the Keeper.

The Emperor boarded his carriage and summoned 釋之 to ride as a companion. They traveled slowly, and the Emperor asked 釋之 about the corruption of 秦. 釋之 answered it all with plain words. Upon arriving at the palace, the Emperor appointed 釋之 as the Warden of the Public Carriages.

A short while later, the Crown Prince and the Prince of 梁王 entered the court in the same carriage and did not dismount at the Sima Gate. Thereupon 釋之 chased and stopped the Crown Prince and the Prince of 梁王, not allowing them to enter the palace gate. He then impeached them for not dismounting at the public gate, which was disrespectful, and submitted the report. Empress Dowager 薄 heard of this. 文帝 removed his cap and apologized, saying: "I taught my sons not strictly." Empress Dowager 薄 then sent a messenger to accept the edict and pardon the Crown Prince and the Prince of 梁王, and only then were they allowed to enter. Because of this, 文帝 considered 釋之 extraordinary and appointed him as Palace Grandee.

A short while later, he reached the position of General of the Gentlemen of the Center. He accompanied the Emperor to 霸陵 and stayed north facing the latrine. At that time 慎夫人 was accompanying them. The Emperor pointed out the road to 新豐 to 慎夫人, saying: "This is the road that goes to 邯鄲." He had 慎夫人 play the 瑟, and he leaned against the 瑟 and sang himself, his mood mournful and sad with longing. He looked back at his ministers and said: "Ah! If one used the stones of North Mountain for the outer coffin, stuffed cut silk and hemp in between, and glued it with lacquer, how could it be moved!" Those around him all said: "Good." 釋之 stepped forward and said: "If there is something desirable inside, even if one sealed the Southern Mountain, there would be cracks; if there is nothing desirable inside, even if there is no stone coffin, what is there to worry about!" 文帝 praised it as good. Afterwards, he appointed 釋之 as the Commandant of Justice.

A short while later, the Emperor went out and passed the Middle Wei Bridge. A person ran out from under the bridge, startling the horses of the imperial carriage. Thereupon he sent cavalry to capture him and handed him over to the Commandant of Justice. 釋之 interrogated him. The man said: "I am a man from the county. I heard the clearing of the road and hid under the bridge. After a long time, I thought the procession had passed, so I came out. I saw the imperial carriage and cavalry, so I just ran." The Commandant of Justice submitted the verdict: one person violated the clearing of the road, the penalty is a fine. 文帝 was angry and said: "This person personally startled my horse. My horse relies on being gentle; if it were another horse, would I not surely be hurt or injured? Yet the Commandant of Justice sentences him to a fine!" 釋之 said: "The law is what the Son of Heaven shares with the world. Now if the law is like this and you make it heavier, it is that the law is not trusted by the people. Moreover, at that time, if Your Majesty had ordered him executed on the spot, that would have been the end of it. Now that you have sent him to the Commandant of Justice, the Commandant of Justice is the standard of fairness for the world. If he leans once, the whole world will apply the law lightly or heavily; where will the people place their hands and feet? I hope Your Majesty considers this." After a long time, the Emperor said: "The Commandant of Justice's verdict is correct."

Afterwards, someone stole the jade ring from the front of the High Ancestor's temple. He was captured, and 文帝 was angry and sent him to the Commandant of Justice for punishment. 釋之 examined the laws regarding those who steal clothing and used items from the ancestral temple and submitted a report, sentencing him to execution in the marketplace. The Emperor was greatly angry and said: "This person is devoid of the Way, stealing the vessels of the late Emperor's temple. I handed him over to the Commandant of Justice intending to exterminate his clan, yet you submit a report according to the law; this is not the meaning with which I reverence the ancestral temple." 釋之 removed his cap and kowtowed to apologize, saying: "The law being like this is sufficient. Moreover, crimes are equal, yet there is a distinction based on the degree of defiance or submission. Now if one steals the vessels of the ancestral temple and exterminates his clan, suppose there is a one in ten thousand chance that a foolish person takes a handful of earth from 長陵, how would Your Majesty increase the punishment for him?" After a long time, 文帝 spoke of it with the Empress Dowager and then approved the Commandant of Justice's verdict. At that time, the Commandant of the Capital, the Marquis of 條, 周亞夫, and the Chancellor of 梁, the Marquis of 山都, 王恬開, saw that 釋之 held fair opinions, so they became close friends. Commandant of Justice 張 was praised by the world because of this.

Later, 文帝 passed away and 景帝 was established. 釋之 was afraid and claimed illness. He wanted to resign to leave, but feared a great execution would come; he wanted to go and apologize, but did not know what the outcome would be. He used the plan of 王生 and finally went to apologize. 景帝 did not blame him.

王生 was good at the words of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi and was a scholar who had not entered office. He was once summoned to stay in the court. The Three Dukes and Nine Ministers all stood gathered. 王生, an old man, said: "My sock has come loose," and looked back at Commandant of Justice 張 saying: "Tie my sock for me!" 釋之 knelt and tied it. After he was done, someone asked 王生: "Why do you alone humiliate Commandant of Justice 張 in the court, making him kneel and tie your sock?" 王生 said: "I am old and lowly. I estimate that in the end I can be of no benefit to Commandant of Justice 張. Commandant of Justice 張 is a famous minister of the world today. I therefore purposely humiliate the Commandant of Justice, making him kneel and tie my sock, to increase his dignity." The lords heard this, considered 王生 wise and placed weight on Commandant of Justice 張.

Commandant of Justice 張 served 景帝 for over a year, then became the Chancellor of the King of 淮南. He still held onto past faults. After a long time, 釋之 died. His son was named 張摯, courtesy name 長公. His official rank reached Grandee, then he was dismissed. Because he could not curry favor with the times, he did not serve as an official for the rest of his life.

馮唐's grandfather was a man of 趙. His father moved to 代. When 漢 rose, they moved to 安陵. 唐 was known for filial piety and served as the Chief of the Gentlemen of the Center, serving 文帝. 文帝 passed by in a carriage and asked 唐: "Why does an elder like you serve as a Gentleman? Where is your home?" 唐 answered according to the facts. 文帝 said: "When I lived at 代, my Chief Steward for Food 高袪 often spoke to me of the worthiness of the 趙 general 李齊, who fought at 鉅鹿. Now whenever I eat, my mind has never not been at 鉅鹿. Does the elder know of him?" 唐 answered: "He is not as good as 廉頗 or 李牧 being generals." The Emperor said: "Why?" 唐 said: "My grandfather when he was in 趙 was an officer leading troops and was close to 李牧. My late father was formerly the Chancellor of 代 and was close to the 趙 general 李齊, so I know what kind of person he is." The Emperor, having heard about the character of 廉頗 and 李牧, was very pleased and slapped his thigh, saying: "Ah! If only I could get 廉頗 and 李牧 to be my generals now, how would I worry about the 匈奴!" 唐 said: "Your subject! Even if Your Majesty got 廉頗 and 李牧, you would not be able to use them." The Emperor was angry, got up and went into the forbidden quarters. After a long time, he summoned 唐 and reproached him: "How do you humiliate me in front of everyone? Is there no private place?" 唐 apologized: "I am a rustic man and do not know taboos."

At that time, the 匈奴 had recently invaded 朝那 on a large scale and killed 卬, the Commandant of 北地. The Emperor was concerned about the Hu invasion, so he finally asked 唐 again: "How do you know I cannot use 廉頗 and 李牧?" 唐 answered: "I have heard that when the ancient kings sent generals, they knelt and pushed the wheel, saying: 'Within the gates, I control it; outside the gates, the general controls it.' Military merits and rank rewards were all decided outside, and reported upon return. This was not empty talk. My grandfather said that when 李牧 was a 趙 general stationed at the border, the rent from the army market was all used by him to feast the soldiers. Rewards and bestowals were decided outside, not disturbed from within. He entrusted them and demanded success, so 李牧 was able to fully use his intelligence and ability. He selected one thousand three hundred chariots, ten thousand three hundred mounted archers, and one hundred thousand soldiers worth a hundred gold. Therefore, he drove the 單于 north, defeated the 東胡, destroyed the 澹林, suppressed the strong 秦 in the west, and supported 韓 and 魏 in the south. At that time, 趙 nearly became a hegemon. Later, when the King of 趙, 遷, was established, his mother was a singer. When King 遷 was established, he used the slander of 郭開 and finally executed 李牧, ordering 顏聚 to replace him. Therefore, the army was defeated and the soldiers fled north, and they were captured and destroyed by 秦. Now I have privately heard that 魏尚 is the Governor of 雲中. He uses all the rent from the army market to feast the soldiers. He spends his own private money, kills a cow every five days to feast guests, army officers, and retainers. Therefore, the 匈奴 stay far away and do not approach the fortress of 雲中. The captives once entered, and 尚 led chariots and cavalry to attack them, killing many of them. The soldiers are all children of families, rising from the fields to join the army. How do they know the tallies and registers? They fight all day, cutting off heads and capturing captives, and report their merits to the headquarters. If a single word does not correspond, the clerical officials bind them with the law. The rewards are not carried out, while the officials uphold the law and must apply it. I am foolish and think Your Majesty's laws are too clear, rewards too light, and punishments too heavy. Moreover, the Governor of 雲中, 魏尚, committed an offense because the heads he reported and the captives he took were off by six levels. Your Majesty handed him over to the officials, stripped him of his nobility, and sentenced him to hard labor. Speaking from this, even if Your Majesty got 廉頗 and 李牧, you would not be able to use them. I am truly foolish and have touched on taboos. Death penalty, death penalty!" 文帝 was pleased. That day he ordered 馮唐 to hold the imperial staff and pardon 魏尚, restoring him as Governor of 雲中, and appointed 唐 as the Commandant of Chariots and Cavalry, in charge of the soldiers of the Commandant of the Capital and the commanderies and kingdoms.

In the seventh year, 景帝 was established and appointed 唐 as the Chancellor of 楚, then dismissed him. When 武帝 was established, he sought worthy and good men and recommended 馮唐. 唐 was then over ninety years old and could no longer serve as an official, so he made 唐's son 馮遂 a Gentleman. 遂's courtesy name was 王孫. He was also an extraordinary scholar and was friendly with me.

The Grand Historian says: 張季's words about elders, upholding the law and not bending to others' will; 馮公's discussion of generals, how flavorful it is! How flavorful it is! The saying goes, "If you do not know the person, look at his friends." What these two lords praised and recited can be displayed in the court and temple. The Book of Documents says, "Not partial, not partisan, the Royal Way is vast; not partisan, not partial, the Royal Way is level." 張季 and 馮公 are close to this. [end of text]
