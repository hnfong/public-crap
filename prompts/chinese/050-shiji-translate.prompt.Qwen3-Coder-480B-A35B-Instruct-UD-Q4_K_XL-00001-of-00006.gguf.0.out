**Biography of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang**

Zhang Shizhi, the Minister of Justice, was from Duyang, with the courtesy name Ji. He had an elder brother, Zhong, with whom he lived. He became a cavalry attendant through financial contribution and served Emperor Wen of Han, but after ten years he had not been promoted and was not known for anything in particular. Zhang Shizhi said, "Serving in office for so long has diminished my brother Zhong's estate, and I have not achieved anything." He wanted to resign and return home. The Chief of the Gentlemen of the Middle Gate, Yuan Ang, knew of his worth and regretted his departure, so he requested that Zhang Shizhi be transferred to fill a vacancy as a palace usher. After Zhang Shizhi had completed his audience with the emperor, he approached and spoke of matters of convenience. Emperor Wen said, "Keep it simple; don’t speak too grandly. Let it be something that can be implemented now." Zhang Shizhi then spoke at length about the affairs between the Qin and Han dynasties, and why the Qin fell and the Han rose. Emperor Wen praised him and appointed Zhang Shizhi as Chief Palace Usher.

Zhang Shizhi accompanied the emperor on an outing and climbed up to the tiger enclosure. The emperor asked the superintendent of the Imperial Park for the register of birds and beasts. After more than ten questions, the superintendent looked around and could not answer any of them. The assistant supervisor of the tiger enclosure answered the emperor’s questions about the register of birds and beasts in great detail, hoping to show his ability to respond quickly and fluently. Emperor Wen said, "Shouldn’t officials be like this? This superintendent is useless!" He then ordered Zhang Shizhi to appoint the assistant supervisor as the new superintendent of the Imperial Park. Zhang Shizhi delayed for a long time before approaching and said, "How does Your Majesty regard Marquis Jianghou, Zhou Bo?" The emperor replied, "He was a man of virtue." Zhang Shizhi asked again, "What about Marquis Dongyang, Zhang Xiangru?" The emperor replied again, "He was also a man of virtue." Zhang Shizhi said, "Although Marquis Jianghou and Marquis Dongyang were called men of virtue, neither of them could even get a word out when speaking on matters. How could they imitate this glib assistant supervisor with his silver tongue and quick wit! Moreover, the Qin dynasty, by relying on clerks trained in legal procedures, caused officials to compete in being harsh, meticulous, and overly strict, but the result was merely superficial formalities, without any compassion. Thus, the emperor could not hear of his faults, and the dynasty declined until the Second Emperor, when the empire collapsed. Now, if Your Majesty promotes this assistant supervisor for his eloquence, I fear that the whole empire will follow suit, all striving to be eloquent but lacking substance. Moreover, those below imitate those above more swiftly than a shadow follows a form or an echo follows a sound, so Your Majesty must be cautious in your actions." Emperor Wen said, "Well said." He then abandoned the idea of appointing the assistant supervisor.

When the emperor got into his carriage, he summoned Zhang Shizhi to ride with him. As they rode slowly, he asked Zhang Shizhi about the defects of the Qin dynasty. Zhang Shizhi answered frankly. Upon arriving at the palace, the emperor appointed Zhang Shizhi as Commandant of the Guards.

Not long after, the Crown Prince and Prince of Liang shared a carriage to attend court and did not dismount at Sima Gate. Zhang Shizhi pursued them and stopped them from entering the palace gate. He then impeached them for failing to dismount at the public gate, charging them with disrespect, and submitted a report. When Empress Dowager Bo heard of it, Emperor Wen removed his hat and apologized, saying, "I failed to educate my son properly." The Empress Dowager then sent an envoy with an imperial edict to pardon the Crown Prince and Prince of Liang, after which they were allowed to enter. From this incident, Emperor Wen regarded Zhang Shizhi as extraordinary and appointed him as a Middle Doctor.

Not long after, Zhang Shizhi was promoted to Chief of the Gentlemen of the Middle Gate. He accompanied the emperor on a trip to Balin, where they stopped and looked down from the north toward the cliff. At that time, Consort Shen followed the emperor. The emperor pointed out the road to Xinfeng for Consort Shen and said, "This is the road to Handan." He had Consort Shen play the se, and he leaned on the se and sang, feeling sad and melancholy. He turned to his ministers and said, "Alas! If we use stones from the northern mountain for the coffin, and line it with coarse cloth and lacquer, how could it ever be disturbed!" Those around him all said, "Excellent." Zhang Shizhi stepped forward and said, "If there is something desirable inside, even if the coffin is sealed with metal and stone from the southern mountain, there will still be a gap. If there is nothing desirable inside, even without a stone coffin, what harm is there?" Emperor Wen praised him. Later, he appointed Zhang Shizhi as Minister of Justice.

Not long after, while the emperor was traveling across the Zhongwei Bridge, a man suddenly ran out from under the bridge, startling the emperor’s horse. The emperor sent riders to capture him and handed him over to the Minister of Justice. Zhang Shizhi interrogated him. The man said, "I am a commoner from the county. I heard the imperial procession approaching and hid under the bridge. After a long time, I thought the procession had passed, so I came out. Seeing the emperor’s carriage and horses, I ran away." The Minister of Justice, Zhang Shizhi, ruled that the man had violated the imperial procession and should be fined. Emperor Wen was angry and said, "This man personally startled my horse. Fortunately, my horse was gentle, but if it had been another horse, wouldn’t it have injured me? Yet the Minister of Justice only sentences him to a fine!" Zhang Shizhi said, "The law is something the Son of Heaven shares with all under heaven. Now, if the law is like this and we make it harsher, the law will lose credibility among the people. Moreover, at that moment, if Your Majesty had ordered his immediate execution, it would have been acceptable. But now that he has been handed over to the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Justice is the standard of justice for all under heaven. If the standard is tilted, then all under heaven will follow suit in applying the law, and the people will not know where to place their hands and feet. I beg Your Majesty to consider this." After a long time, the emperor said, "The Minister of Justice is right."

Later, someone stole a jade ring from the altar before the spirit tablet in Emperor Gao’s temple. When caught, Emperor Wen was furious and handed the case to the Minister of Justice. Zhang Shizhi, following the law, reported that anyone who steals items used in the ancestral temples should be executed in public. The emperor was furious and said, "This man is utterly immoral, stealing sacred objects from my father’s temple. I handed him to the Minister of Justice hoping for his entire clan to be punished, but you only sentence him according to the law. This is not how I intend to honor the ancestral temple." Zhang Shizhi removed his hat and kowtowed, apologizing and saying, "The law is sufficient as it is. Moreover, crimes are equal, but their severity differs based on the circumstances. If we execute the entire clan for stealing from the ancestral temple, what if someone, in the worst-case scenario, takes a handful of earth from Emperor Gao’s tomb? What punishment would Your Majesty impose then?" After a long time, Emperor Wen discussed it with the Empress Dowager and finally agreed with the Minister of Justice’s ruling. At that time, the Chief of the Capital Guards, Marquis Tiaohou Zhou Yafu, and the Chancellor of Liang, Marquis Shandouhou Wang Tiankai, seeing that Zhang Shizhi’s judgment was fair, became friends with him. From then on, Zhang Shizhi was praised throughout the empire.

After Emperor Wen passed away and Emperor Jing ascended the throne, Zhang Shizhi feared for his life and claimed illness. He wanted to resign but feared severe punishment; he wanted to apologize but did not know how the emperor would react. Following the advice of Wang Sheng, he finally went to apologize, and Emperor Jing forgave him.

Wang Sheng was a scholar of Huang-Lao philosophy and a hermit. Once, when summoned to the court, all the Three Excellencies and Nine Ministers were present. Wang Sheng, being elderly, said, "My sock has come undone," and turned to Zhang Shizhi, saying, "Tie my sock for me!" Zhang Shizhi knelt and tied it for him. Afterward, someone said to Wang Sheng, "Why did you humiliate Minister Zhang in court by making him kneel to tie your sock?" Wang Sheng replied, "I am old and of low status, and I knew I could be of no benefit to Minister Zhang. Zhang Shizhi is a renowned minister of the empire, and I merely wanted to elevate his status by making him kneel to tie my sock." When the officials heard this, they respected Wang Sheng and esteemed Zhang Shizhi even more.

Zhang Shizhi served Emperor Jing for over a year, becoming the Chancellor of Huainan, still bearing the consequences of his past actions. After a long time, Zhang Shizhi died. His son was named Zhang Zhi, with the courtesy name Changgong, who rose to the rank of Grand Master but was dismissed. Because he could not conform to the times, he never held office for the rest of his life.

Feng Tang’s grandfather was from Zhao. His father moved to Dai. When the Han dynasty was founded, the family moved to Anling. Feng Tang was known for his filial piety and served as the Chief of the Gentlemen of the Middle Gate, attending Emperor Wen. When Emperor Wen passed by in his carriage, he asked Feng Tang, "Old man, why did you become a Gentleman? Where is your home?" Feng Tang answered truthfully. Emperor Wen said, "When I lived in Dai, my food supervisor Gao Qu often spoke to me of the virtue of Li Qi, a general of Zhao, who fought at Julu. Even now, whenever I eat, my thoughts are always at Julu. Do you know of this?" Feng Tang replied, "He was not as good as Lian Po or Li Mu as a general." The emperor asked, "Why?" Feng Tang said, "My grandfather, when in Zhao, was a military officer and was acquainted with Li Mu. My father was once Chancellor of Dai and was acquainted with Li Qi of Zhao, so I know about him." After hearing about Lian Po and Li Mu, Emperor Wen was pleased and slapped his thigh, saying, "Alas! If only I had generals like Lian Po and Li Mu, how could I worry about the Xiongnu!" Feng Tang said, "Forgive me, Your Majesty, but even if you had Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them." The emperor was angry and rose to enter the palace. After a long time, he summoned Feng Tang and rebuked him, saying, "How could you humiliate me in front of everyone? Was there no private place to speak?" Feng Tang apologized, saying, "I am a crude man and do not know the taboos."

At that time, the Xiongnu had recently launched a major invasion of Chaona and killed the Commandant of Beidi, Ang. The emperor was concerned about the Xiongnu threat and finally asked Feng Tang again, "How do you know I cannot use Lian Po and Li Mu?" Feng Tang replied, "I have heard that in ancient times, when kings sent generals to war, they would kneel and push the general’s chariot, saying, ‘Within the gate, I control it; beyond the gate, the general controls it.’ Military rewards and titles were decided by the general in the field and reported afterward. This is not an empty saying. My grandfather said that when Li Mu was a general on the border of Zhao, the taxes from the military market were used to feed the soldiers, and rewards were decided in the field without interference from the court. By entrusting him and demanding results, Li Mu was able to fully use his intelligence and abilities, commanding 1,300 chariots, 13,000 cavalry, and 100,000 brave soldiers. Thus, he drove the Chanyu northward, defeated the Donghu, destroyed the Tanlin, restrained the powerful Qin in the west, and supported Han and Wei in the south. At that time, Zhao was nearly hegemonic. Later, when King Zhao was succeeded by King Qian, whose mother was a courtesan, King Qian employed the slander of Guo Kai and ultimately executed Li Mu, replacing him with Yan Ju. As a result, the army was defeated, the soldiers fled, and Zhao was conquered by Qin. Now I have secretly heard that Wei Shang is the governor of Yunzhong. He uses all the taxes from the military market to feed his soldiers, spends his own money, slaughters cattle every five days to feast guests, officers, and subordinates. Thus, the Xiongnu avoid the area and do not approach the border of Yunzhong. When the enemy once invaded, Wei Shang led his chariots and cavalry to attack them, killing many. The soldiers are all commoners’ sons, raised from the fields, and do not understand military registers and formations. They fight all day, behead enemies, and capture prisoners, reporting their achievements to the command office. If one word does not match, clerks use the law to punish them. Rewards are not given, but punishment is strictly enforced. I am foolish and believe that Your Majesty’s laws are too clear, rewards too light, and punishments too severe. Moreover, Governor Wei Shang was demoted for a discrepancy of only six heads in reporting his achievements. Your Majesty handed him over to the officials, stripped him of his title, and sentenced him to labor. From this, I say that even if Your Majesty had Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them. I am indeed foolish and have touched upon forbidden matters. I deserve death, I deserve death!" Emperor Wen was pleased. That day, he ordered Feng Tang to carry the imperial seal to pardon Wei Shang and restore him as governor of Yunzhong, and appointed Feng Tang as Colonel of Chariots and Cavalry, in charge of the Capital Guards and chariot troops from the commanderies and states.

In the seventh year, Emperor Jing ascended the throne and appointed Feng Tang as Chancellor of Chu, but later dismissed him. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne, he sought virtuous and talented men and recommended Feng Tang. At that time, Feng Tang was over ninety years old and could no longer serve in office, so Feng Tang’s son, Feng Sui, was appointed as a Gentleman. Feng Sui, with the courtesy name Wangsun, was also an extraordinary man and was friendly with me.

Grand Historian said: Zhang Ji’s words reflect the ways of a gentleman, adhering to the law without flattery. Feng Tang’s discussion of generals is truly meaningful! Truly meaningful! As the saying goes, "To know a man, look at his friends." The praises of these two men can be inscribed in the halls of the court. The Book says, "Not partial, not partisan, the royal way is broad and open; not partisan, not partial, the royal way is smooth and easy." Zhang Ji and Feng Tang approached this ideal.
