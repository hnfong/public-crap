Here are the answers based on the text from *Huaji Liezhuan* (Biographies of the Witty and Humorous):

**Q1: Short Summary**
During the reign of Marquis Wen of Wei, Ximen Bao served as the magistrate of Ye. He discovered that local officials and shamans were exploiting the superstition of "marrying a wife to the River God" to extort money and sacrifice young women to the river. Ximen Bao attended the ceremony, claimed the selected girl was not beautiful enough for the God, and threw the chief shaman, her disciples, and the local elders into the river to "report" to the God. This terrified the corrupt officials into stopping the practice. He subsequently organized the construction of twelve irrigation canals, transforming Ye into a prosperous region.

**Q2: Victims**
The victims were young women from **poor families** ("小家女") who were considered beautiful. Their families, fearing the shamans would select them, often fled the city, leaving the town depopulated.

**Q3: Beneficiaries**
The practice benefited the **local officials** (Three Elders, Tingyuan), the **shamans** (Da Wu and her disciples), and the **wealthy elites** (Haozhangzhe). They collected millions of cash from the populace, used a small fraction for the ritual, and kept the rest for themselves.

**Q4: Wits or Force?**
Ximen Bao used **wits (strategy)** primarily, though it involved the threat of force.
*   **Explanation:** He did not immediately arrest or execute the corrupt officials. Instead, he adopted their own logic ("The girl is not good enough, send someone to tell the God") to justify throwing the perpetrators into the river. By mimicking the ritual, he turned their superstition against them, creating a psychological shock that forced them to confess and stop the practice without a direct military confrontation. The "force" was the physical act of throwing them in, but the *method* was a clever trap.

**Q5: Moral Analysis**
Whether Ximen Bao's actions were moral depends on the ethical framework applied:
*   **Utilitarian Perspective (Consequentialism):** **Yes, it was moral.** The outcome saved countless lives (stopping the sacrifices), stopped the economic exploitation of the poor, and brought long-term prosperity through irrigation. The suffering of a few corrupt individuals was outweighed by the salvation of the many.
*   **Deontological Perspective (Duty/Rules):** **No, it was immoral.** Ximen Bao committed murder and judicial overreach. He acted as judge, jury, and executioner without due process, violating the rule of law and the sanctity of human life, even for a "good" cause.
*   **Virtue Ethics:** **Yes, it was moral.** It demonstrated the virtue of courage and wisdom. A true leader must protect the vulnerable from tyranny, even if it requires breaking rigid norms or using extreme measures to break a cycle of fear and corruption.
*   **Historical Context:** In the Warring States period, strong, decisive leadership was often necessary to dismantle entrenched local power structures that the central government could not easily reach.

**Q6: Explanation and Fairness of the Comment**
**Meaning:**
The text quotes a saying comparing three great rulers:
1.  **Zi Chan (Zheng):** The people could not deceive him (implying he was so wise and strict that deception was impossible).
2.  **Zi Jie (Shanfu):** The people could not *bear* to deceive him (implying his benevolence and virtue made them feel guilty if they lied).
3.  **Ximen Bao (Ye):** The people *dared not* deceive him (implying his strictness and fear of punishment kept them in line).
The text asks which of the three was the most virtuous ("most wise/excellent") and suggests that a discerning administrator should be able to distinguish between these styles.

**Fairness of the Comment:**
The comment is **partially fair but incomplete** in its judgment of "virtue."
*   **Fairness:** It accurately describes the *methods* and *immediate effects* of their governance. Ximen Bao's "fear" was effective in stopping the specific evil of the River God sacrifice and enforcing the irrigation projects.
*   **Critique:** However, equating "fear" with the highest form of governance is debatable.
    *   **Zi Jie's** approach (governance by love/virtue) is often considered the highest Confucian ideal, where the people act rightly out of internal moral conviction rather than external fear.
    *   **Ximen Bao's** approach was necessary for a specific, violent crisis, but a society governed solely by fear lacks the deep social cohesion of one governed by mutual respect.
    *   **Conclusion:** The comment is fair in categorizing the *types* of rule, but it is arguably unfair to suggest Ximen Bao was the "most excellent" simply because he instilled fear. True "excellence" (Xian) usually implies a balance where the people *do not need* to be afraid because they are virtuous (Zi Jie's model), or where the ruler is so wise that deception is unnecessary (Zi Chan's model). Ximen Bao's "fear" was a tool for a specific emergency, not necessarily the pinnacle of moral governance. [end of text]
