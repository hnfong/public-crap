Here is a poem titled "Ode to Shanghai Maglev" in the style of Tang poetry, with a strict rhyme scheme:

咏上海磁浮

上海滨，磁浮高架长
电风激荡，疾如惊鸿翔
从浦东机场，直至龙阳站
疾驰三十公里，仅只七分钟强

车身银白，窗明镜净澄
内舱温暖，舒适如春庭
过隧道疾，穿越江南城
两岸风景，似画卷层层呈

磁浮之奇，非人力所能
电磁交互，疾速如神仙
乘客欢乐，感受速度乐
上海磁浮，高铁之冠冕

Note:

* The poem follows the traditional Tang poetry rhyme scheme of AABB CCDD EEFF GG.
* The meter is 5 characters per line, with a consistent tone pattern.
* The language and imagery are inspired by Tang poetry, with a focus on the beauty and wonder of the Shanghai Maglev train.

Translation:

Ode to Shanghai Maglev

On Shanghai's shore, the Maglev track is long
Electric winds howl, swift as a startled swan's song
From Pudong Airport, straight to Longyang Station
Racing thirty kilometers, in just seven minutes' duration

The silver-white carriage, windows clear and bright
The warm and cozy cabin, like a spring garden in sight
Through tunnels we speed, crossing the Jiangnan city
Scenic views on both banks, like a layered painting unfolding with ease

The Maglev's marvel, beyond human might
Electromagnetic interactions, swift as a divine flight
Passengers rejoice, feeling the thrill of speed
Shanghai Maglev, the crown of high-speed rail indeed
