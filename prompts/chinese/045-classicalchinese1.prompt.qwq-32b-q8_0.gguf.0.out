Consider the following text from 滑稽列传 and answer questions:

```
魏文侯时，西门豹为邺令。豹往到邺，会长老，问之民所疾苦。长老曰：「苦为河伯娶妇，以故贫。」豹问其故，对曰：「邺三老、廷掾常岁赋敛百姓，收取其钱得数百万，用其二三十万为河伯娶妇，与祝巫共分其余钱持归。当其时，巫行视小家女好者，云是当为河伯妇，即娉取。洗沐之，为治新缯绮縠衣，闲居斋戒；为治斋宫河上，张缇绛帷，女居其中。为具牛酒饭食，行十余日。共粉饰之，如嫁女床席，令女居其上，浮之河中。始浮，行数十里乃没。其人家有好女者，恐大巫祝为河伯取之，以故多持女远逃亡。以故城中益空无人，又困贫，所从来久远矣。民人俗语曰『即不为河伯娶妇，水来漂没，溺其人民』云。」西门豹曰：「至为河伯娶妇时，愿三老、巫祝、父老送女河上，幸来告语之，吾亦往送女。」皆曰：「诺。」

至其时，西门豹往会之河上。三老、官属、豪长者、里父老皆会，以人民往观之者三二千人。其巫，老女子也，已年七十。从弟子女十人所，皆衣缯单衣，立大巫后。西门豹曰：「呼河伯妇来，视其好丑。」即将女出帷中，来至前。豹视之，顾谓三老、巫祝、父老曰：「是女子不好，烦大巫妪为入报河伯，得更求好女，后日送之。」即使吏卒共抱大巫妪投之河中。有顷，曰：「巫妪何久也？弟子趣之！」复以弟子一人投河中。有顷，曰：「弟子何久也？复使一人趣之！」复投一弟子河中。凡投三弟子。西门豹曰：「巫妪弟子是女子也，不能白事，烦三老为入白之。」复投三老河中。西门豹簪笔磬折，向河立待良久。长老、吏傍观者皆惊恐。西门豹顾曰：「巫妪、三老不来还，柰之何？」欲复使廷掾与豪长者一人入趣之。皆叩头，叩头且破，额血流地，色如死灰。西门豹曰：「诺，且留待之须臾。」须臾，豹曰：「廷掾起矣。状河伯留客之久，若皆罢去归矣。」邺吏民大惊恐，从是以后，不敢复言为河伯娶妇。

西门豹即发民凿十二渠，引河水灌民田，田皆溉。当其时，民治渠少烦苦，不欲也。豹曰：「民可以乐成，不可与虑始。今父老子弟虽患苦我，然百岁后期令父老子孙思我言。」至今皆得水利，民人以给足富。十二渠经绝驰道，到汉之立，而长吏以为十二渠桥绝驰道，相比近，不可。欲合渠水，且至驰道合三渠为一桥。邺民人父老不肯听长吏，以为西门君所为也，贤君之法式不可更也。长吏终听置之。故西门豹为邺令，名闻天下，泽流后世，无绝已时，几可谓非贤大夫哉！

Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. Starting with Q1, the summary. The story is about West Men Bao (西门豹) who becomes the magistrate of Yecheng. He investigates the problem of the people and finds out they're being forced to give daughters to the river god (河伯) as brides, which is actually a scam by the officials and priests to extort money. He then cleverly stops this by pretending to send the priests into the river, which scares everyone into stopping the practice. Later, he builds irrigation channels to help the agriculture, which benefits the people long-term. So the summary needs to capture his actions and the outcome.

Q2 asks what kind of women were victims. The text mentions "小家女好者" which translates to young girls from poorer families who are considered beautiful. So the answer is young, beautiful daughters from poorer families.

Q3: Who benefits from the old practice? The three elders (三老), the officials (廷掾), and the priests (祝巫) split the money collected. So they are the beneficiaries.

Q4: Did he use wits or force? Definitely wits. He didn't just confront them directly but used a staged event where he threw the priest and her assistants into the river, making others fear the consequences. This was a clever strategy rather than brute force.

Q5: Is it moral? From the people's perspective, yes, because it stops exploitation. From a legal standpoint, maybe not, since he's using threats and possibly illegal methods. From a utilitarian view, the ends justify the means as it leads to a better outcome. But some might argue it's unethical to deceive and threaten people, even for a good cause.

Q6: The quote compares three officials. The user needs to explain that the comment is saying each had different styles:子产's people couldn't deceive him (strict),子贱's couldn't bear to deceive (kind), and西门豹's were afraid to deceive (fear-based). The question is which is best. The fairness of the comment depends on whether effectiveness and methods are the criteria. It's fair in that it acknowledges different governance styles, but maybe not if one style is considered superior. The user should explain that the author is prompting readers to evaluate which method is better, so the comment is fair as it presents different approaches without bias.

**Q1: Summary**  
西门豹任邺县令，发现官吏与巫祝以“河伯娶妇”为名勒索百姓，迫使贫苦人家献出女儿。他假意配合，当众将大巫、弟子及三老投入河中，震慑民众，废除恶俗。后兴修水利，使邺地富足，其政绩流芳后世。  

**Q2: Victims**  
家境贫寒但容貌美丽的少女（小家女好者）。  

**Q3: Beneficiaries**  
三老、廷掾（地方官员）与祝巫（巫师）共同瓜分敛财。  

**Q4: Wits or Force?**  
西门豹用智谋。他假装让巫妪向河伯禀报，借“久未返回”为由，连续投巫妪及其弟子、三老入河，制造恐慌，迫使民众自行停止恶俗，而非直接暴力镇压。  

**Q5: Moral Evaluation**  
- **Pro**: 民众角度：有效终结剥削，保护无辜少女，长远造福百姓。  
- **Ethical Concerns**: 使用欺骗与威胁手段，逾越法律程序，可能被视为滥用权力。  
- **Utilitarian**: 结果正当，短期震慑换取长期利益。  
- **Critics**: 手段过激，损害无辜者（如巫妪弟子）权益，违背程序正义。  

**Q6: Explanation & Fairness**  
- **Meaning**: 子产治郑，以严明防欺；子贱治单父，以仁德止欺；西门豹治邺，以威势禁欺。三人治政风格不同，难分高下，需依情境评判。  
- **Fairness**: 公允。司马迁客观对比三者治政特色，未偏袒任何一方，强调治理需因地制宜。评论引发思考，不同情境下何种方式更有效，故评价合理。 [end of text]
