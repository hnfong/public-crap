Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. Starting with Q1, the summary. The story is about West Men Bao dealing with the problem of sacrificing girls to the river god. He uses a clever plan to stop the corrupt officials and priests. The key points are his strategy, the consequences, and the positive outcome like the irrigation channels.

Q2 asks about the victims. The text mentions "小家女好者" which translates to young, good-looking daughters from poorer families. So the answer should specify that they were young, beautiful girls from poor families.

Q3 is about who benefited. The three elders, the officials (廷掾), and the priests (祝巫) divided the money collected for the ritual. So the beneficiaries are the local officials and priests.

Q4 is about whether he used wits or force. The story shows he tricked them by pretending to send the witch and others to inform the river god, then threw them into the river. He didn't use direct force but clever deception, so the answer is wits, explained with his actions.

Q5 is about the morality. From a moral standpoint, some might say it's justified because he stopped a harmful practice and protected people. Others might argue that using deception and endangering lives is unethical. Need to present both sides.

Q6 refers to the quote comparing three officials. The comment says West Men Bao's governance made people "dare not deceive," implying fear-based compliance. The question is whether this is fair. The comparison is about different styles:子产 is strict,子贱 is kind,西门豹 uses fear. The fairness depends on whether effectiveness and methods are valid. The author might think they're all good but different, so the comment is fair in recognizing their unique strengths.

**Q1: Summary**  
西门豹任邺县令时，发现当地官员与巫祝以“河伯娶妇”为名敛财，迫使贫苦人家献出女儿为祭，导致民穷财尽。他设计当众投巫婆及弟子入河，震慑腐败势力，废除陋习，并兴修水利，使邺地富足。其智谋与政绩名垂后世。  

**Q2: Victims**  
家境贫寒、容貌姣好的年轻女子。  

**Q3: Beneficiaries**  
三老（地方官员）、廷掾（属吏）及巫祝（巫师），他们瓜分剩余钱财。  

**Q4: Wits or Force?**  
西门豹用智谋而非武力。他假装让巫婆入河传信，借机将巫婆及同伙投入河中，利用民众的恐惧心理迫使官员放弃恶习，避免直接冲突，达到教化目的。  

**Q5: Moral Evaluation**  
- **Pro**: 正当防卫。他以小代价终结害民恶俗，保护无辜生命，符合“大义灭亲”的道德观。  
- **Con**: 手段过激。欺骗并威胁他人生命，可能逾越法律界限，存在道德风险。  

**Q6: Analysis of the Quote**  
- **Meaning**: 子产治郑，百姓不敢欺瞒；子贱治单父，百姓不忍欺骗；西门豹治邺，百姓不敢欺骗。三人治政风格不同（严明、仁爱、威压），但均卓有成效。  
- **Fairness**: 公平。司马迁以“治者当能别之”强调治理需因地制宜，三人各有所长，西门豹的威严手段在当时情境下有效，故并列评价合理。其评论突显“政绩”重于“手段”的史家视角。 [end of text]
