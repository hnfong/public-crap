**Q1: Short summary of the story (5 points)**  
During the reign of King Wen of Wei,西门豹 (Xi Men Bao) served as the magistrate of Ye City. Upon arriving, he learned that the people were suffering due to the corrupt practice of offering young girls as sacrifices to the River God. To address this, he cleverly exposed the fraud during a ceremony meant to offer a girl to the river god, eliminating the corrupt officials and stopping the practice. He also implemented irrigation projects to benefit the people, earning their gratitude and ensuring the prosperity of Ye City.

**Q2: What kind of women were usually the victims in the story (2 points)**  
The victims were typically young, beautiful girls from poor families, chosen by corrupt officials and witches to be sacrificed to the River God.

**Q3: Who were deemed to benefit from the old practice of offering girls (2 points)**  
The corrupt officials, including the elders, head of the ritual, and local officials, benefited from the practice as they collected money from the people for the sacrifices.

**Q4: Did the protagonist use wits or force to deal with the situation? Explain (5 points)**  
西门豹 primarily used his wits. He pretended to accept the sacrifice and orchestrated the elimination of the corrupt officials by strategically throwing them into the river. This approach avoided direct confrontation and ensured the corrupt were held accountable without immediate violence.

**Q5: Was it moral for the protagonist to do so? Briefly provide views from various perspectives (10 points)**  
- **Moral from a utilitarian perspective**: Yes, as it ended a harmful practice that caused suffering and improved the lives of the people.  
- **Moral from a deontological perspective**: Debatable, as he deceived and killed individuals, which could be seen as unethical.  
- **Moral from a Confucian perspective**: Mixed. While his actions were pragmatic and aimed at the greater good, they involved deception and violence, which Confucianism generally discourages.  
- **Moral from a modern legal perspective**: Debatable, as his actions could be seen as justified under the principle of preventing greater harm, but modern legal systems typically prohibit such actions.  

**Q6: Explain the comment and whether it is fair (15 points)**  
The comment compares the governance of three historical figures: 子产 (Zi Chan) of Zheng, 子贱 (Zi Jian) of Shanfu, and 西门豹 (Xi Men Bao) of Ye. It suggests that Zi Chan's governance left the people uninstructed but not deceived, Zi Jian's governance left the people unmotivated but not oppressed, and Xi Men Bao's governance left the people awed but not cheated.  

- **Fairness**: The comment is partially fair but subjective. Each leader had a different approach, and their methods suited the context of their governance. Xi Men Bao's actions, while effective, involved deception and violence, which may not align with the ideal of "not cheated." The comment emphasizes the outcomes rather than the methods, which could oversimplify the complexity of governance.
