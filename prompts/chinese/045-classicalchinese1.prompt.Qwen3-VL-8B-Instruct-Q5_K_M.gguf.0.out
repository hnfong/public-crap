Q1:  
West Gate (Ximen) Bao, as magistrate of Ye during the reign of Wei Wenhou, exposed and dismantled the corrupt ritual of sacrificing young women to the river god “He Bo,” by publicly executing the witch, her disciples, and officials involved. He then led the people to dig irrigation canals, bringing prosperity. His actions earned him lasting fame and respect.

Q2:  
Usually, poor or ordinary girls from families fearing the witch’s selection were chosen — often those whose families could not afford to bribe or flee.

Q3:  
The local officials (three elders, court clerks), the witch, and the wealthy or influential families benefited — they collected tribute, shared the money, and maintained control through fear.

Q4:  
He used wits — feigning cooperation, pretending to follow tradition, then exploiting the ritual’s absurdity to expose and punish the corrupt. He manipulated the system to dismantle it, not through brute force but psychological and procedural deception.

Q5:  
Moral perspectives:  
- **Utilitarian**: Yes — saved lives, ended exploitation, brought prosperity.  
- **Cultural relativist**: No — violated local customs, possibly causing unrest.  
- **Legalist**: Yes — enforced justice, punished corruption.  
- **Humanist**: Yes — protected vulnerable girls, restored dignity.  
- **Traditionalist**: No — disrupted ancestral rites, may have caused social upheaval.  
Overall, his actions were morally justified as a necessary reform for public good.

Q6:  
This quote says: “Zi Chan governed Zheng and the people could not deceive him; Zi Jian governed Danfu and the people could not bear to deceive him; Ximen Bao governed Ye and the people dared not deceive him.” It praises their governance — Zi Chan’s strictness, Zi Jian’s moral influence, and Ximen Bao’s fear-based deterrence.  
Fairness:  
- **Zi Chan** — most effective in law and order.  
- **Zi Jian** — most morally persuasive.  
- **Ximen Bao** — most feared, but also most pragmatic.  
The comment is fair — each ruler succeeded in different ways, and Ximen Bao’s “dare not deceive” reflects his effectiveness in reforming a corrupt system. His legacy is not about moral persuasion but systemic change — which is arguably the most impactful. [end of text]
