This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

(1) In the passage from Xunzi, the ruler of Wei (Wu) was devising schemes and successfully evading capture, which brought him joy. Zhou Gongzhi asked Wudi, "Hasn't there been a similar situation with the Zhao kings where their subjects couldn't apprehend them, and they appeared troubled?" Wudi asked, "What about the Zhao kings?" Zhou Gongzhi then said, "The Zhao kings were devising schemes without any provisions, and their subjects couldn't catch them, leading to their distress. They expressed this through a saying: 'When a ruler becomes great by seeking scholars, loyalty by seeking strength, and suspicion by seeking support, if they only scheme without any foundation, they will surely perish.' Seeing today's ruler, who also schemes without provisions and cannot be captured by the people, it seems that our kingdom is on the brink of destruction. This causes their distress.' The Zhao kings were troubled, while the Emperor was pleased." Wudi continued to observe and pay his respects again.

(2) The moral of the story is that a ruler who relies solely on scholars (intelligence) without the support of loyalty or strong alliances will eventually face downfall and distress.

(3) The concepts in this story have a counterpart in Western (European) thought, particularly in the ideas of the importance of alliances and loyalty. A ruler who does not cultivate loyalty among their subjects or form strong alliances may find themselves in a precarious position, just as the Zhao kings in the story. This is seen in various historical examples where rulers who failed to build strong relationships with their allies faced difficulties.<|end|>
