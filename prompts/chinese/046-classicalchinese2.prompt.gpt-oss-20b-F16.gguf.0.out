<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to translate passage from Xunzi (荀子). Provide translation, moral, and counterpart in Western thought.

Let's analyze passage.

Original Chinese:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退回朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，故此憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，故自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今不穀之不肖，群臣莫能逮，吾國之幾於亡也！是以憂。』楚莊王以憂而君以喜。武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」"

But there may be some errors in transcription. Let's parse.

We have: "魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，故此憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，故自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今不穀之不肖，群臣莫能逮，吾國之幾於亡也！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」"

But there are some mis-characters: "退朝而有喜色" maybe "退朝而有憂色" earlier? Actually first line: "魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色" means "Wei Wuhou (Marquis of Wei) was planning a matter and succeeded; no minister could catch him; he returned to the palace with a joyous expression." Then Wu Qi (Wu Qi?) says: "Did you also hear the words of King Zhuang of Chu?" Wait: "吳起進" maybe "Wu Qi" or "Wu Qi" (Wu Qi is a general). He says: "Did you also hear the words of King Zhuang of Chu?" The Marquis replies: "What are King Zhuang's words?" Wu Qi says: "King Zhuang of Chu was planning a matter and succeeded; no minister could catch him; he returned to the palace with a worried expression." Wait: earlier we had "喜色" vs "憂色". Let's parse: In the story, the Marquis of Wei had a joyous expression after planning a matter successfully. Wu Qi says: "Did you also hear the words of King Zhuang of Chu?" The Marquis: "What are King Zhuang's words?" Wu Qi: "King Zhuang of Chu was planning a matter and succeeded; no minister could catch him; he returned to the palace with a worried expression." Then "申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』" Means "Shengong Wu Chen (Shengong Wu Chen?) asked: 'Why does the king return to the palace with a worried expression?'" Actually "申公巫臣進" maybe "Shengong Wu Chen" or "Shengong Wu Chen" is a minister? Wait: "申公巫臣進" maybe "Shengong Wu Chen" is a minister? Let's parse: "申公巫臣進" maybe "Shengong Wu Chen" is a minister? Actually "申公" is "Shengong" (the minister of the state of Wei?). "巫臣進" maybe "Wu Chen Jin"? I'm not sure. But the point: He asks: "Why does the king return to the palace with a worried expression?" King Zhuang replies: "Because I am not good at planning; no minister can catch me; thus I am worried. In the words of Zhong Li (Zhong Li?), he said: 'The lords who have a teacher are kings, those who have friends are tyrants, those who have doubts are preserved; thus if you plan for yourself and no one can match you, you will die.' Now, because I am not good at planning, no minister can catch me, my country is almost doomed! That is why I am worried." Then "楚莊王以憂而君以喜" means "King Zhuang of Chu was worried, but the king (Wei Wuhou) was happy." Wait: "君" refers to the king of Wei? Actually "君" refers to the king of Wei? But the story: "武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」" Means "Marquis of Wei circled and bowed again, saying: 'The heavens have sent the Master to correct my mistake.'" So the moral: The difference between planning and execution: The Wei Wuhou's success leads to joy; King Zhuang's lack of skill leads to worry. The moral: The importance of being able to plan and execute, and the need for ministers to catch up? Wait: Let's analyze.

The story: The Wei Wuhou (Marquis of Wei) is planning a matter and succeeding; no minister can catch him; he returns to the palace with a joyous expression. Wu Qi asks if he has heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu. The Marquis says: "What are King Zhuang's words?" Wu Qi says: "King Zhuang of Chu was planning a matter and succeeded; no minister could catch him; he returned to the palace with a worried expression." Then a minister asks: "Why does the king return to the palace with a worried expression?" King Zhuang replies: "Because I am not good at planning; no minister can catch me; thus I am worried. In the words of Zhong Li, 'The lords who have a teacher are kings, those who have friends are tyrants, those who have doubts are preserved; thus if you plan for yourself and no one can match you, you will die.' Now, because I am not good at planning, no minister can catch me, my country is almost doomed! That is why I am worried." Then King Zhuang is worried, but the king (Wei Wuhou) is happy. The Marquis of Wei bows again, saying: "The heavens have sent the Master to correct my mistake."

But the moral: The difference between planning and execution? Actually the moral might be: "Even if you plan well, you must also have the support of ministers; otherwise you will be worried." Or "The difference between success and worry is due to the difference in planning ability." Or "The wise master can correct mistakes." Let's analyze the context: Xunzi's "Zhong Li" maybe "Zhong Li" is a phrase from "Zhong Li" (the middle of the valley?). Actually "中蘬" maybe "Zhong Li" or "Zhong Li"?

Ok, we need to produce translation, moral, and counterpart.

Let's produce translation:

"魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。"
