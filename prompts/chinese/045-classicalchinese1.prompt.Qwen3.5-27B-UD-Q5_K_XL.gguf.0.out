### Q1: Short Summary (5 points)
Ximen Bao, appointed magistrate of Ye, discovered that local officials and priests were exploiting the people by claiming to marry girls to the River God (He Bo), causing poverty and flight. To stop this, he attended the ceremony, feigned dissatisfaction with the chosen girl, and ordered the chief priestess, her assistants, and the village elders to be thrown into the river to "report" to the god. Terrified by this "divine punishment," the officials begged for mercy, and the practice ceased. Bao then mobilized the people to dig irrigation canals, bringing long-term prosperity to the region.

### Q2: Victims of the Practice (2 points)
The victims were **young, beautiful girls from poor families** ("small family girls" or *xiaojia nv*). Wealthier families often sent their daughters away to escape the selection, leaving the poor as the primary targets.

### Q3: Beneficiaries of the Old Practice (2 points)
The practice primarily benefited the **local corrupt officials and religious leaders**, specifically:
1.  The **Three Elders** (*Sanlao*).
2.  The **Court Clerk** (*Tingyuan*).
3.  The **Chief Priestess** (*Wu*) and her **assistants** (*Zhushi*).
They colluded to collect taxes from the people, used a small portion for the ritual, and divided the remaining millions among themselves.

### Q4: Wits or Force? (5 points)
Ximen Bao used **wits (cunning strategy)** rather than brute force.
*   **Explanation:** He did not arrest the officials immediately or use physical violence to suppress them directly. Instead, he employed **irony and psychological warfare**. By pretending to believe in the superstition, he turned the ritual against the perpetrators. He used the logic of the superstition itself (sending messengers to the god) to justify throwing the corrupt leaders into the river. This terrified the onlookers and the officials into submission without a physical battle, effectively dismantling the superstition through its own absurdity.

### Q5: Morality of the Protagonist's Actions (10 points)
The morality of Ximen Bao's actions is complex and depends on the ethical framework applied:

*   **Utilitarian Perspective (Moral):** The action was moral because it saved countless future girls from death and ended a massive financial scam, leading to long-term prosperity (irrigation) for the people. The "greater good" outweighed the immediate harm to the corrupt few.
*   **Deontological/Legal Perspective (Immoral):** From a strict rule-of-law view, it was immoral. Ximen Bao acted as judge, jury, and executioner without a trial. He committed murder (or attempted murder) and violated due process, regardless of the victims' guilt.
*   **Consequentialist Perspective (Moral):** The consequences were overwhelmingly positive. The fear instilled by his actions permanently stopped the ritual and allowed for necessary infrastructure projects. The "ends justified the means."
*   **Virtue Ethics Perspective (Mixed):** While his intent was benevolent (protecting the weak), his method involved deception and cruelty. However, in the context of a corrupt system where legal channels were compromised by the very officials he was fighting, his "ruthless benevolence" can be seen as a necessary virtue to restore order.

### Q6: Analysis of the Final Comment (15 points)

**Meaning of the Quote:**
The text compares three famous administrators:
1.  **Zi Chan (Zheng):** "People could not deceive him." He was so sharp and knowledgeable that deception was impossible.
2.  **Zi Jian (Danfu):** "People were unwilling to deceive him." He ruled with such benevolence and moral example that people felt ashamed to lie.
3.  **Ximen Bao (Ye):** "People dared not deceive him." He ruled with such strictness, authority, and fear of punishment that people were too terrified to lie.

The question asks which of these three talents is the most virtuous, challenging the reader to distinguish the nature of their governance.

**Fairness of the Comment:**
The comment is **fair and insightful**, as it accurately categorizes the distinct styles of governance, though it implies a hierarchy of virtue.

*   **Accuracy:** It correctly identifies Ximen Bao's method. As seen in the story, he used fear (throwing people into the river) to stop the deception. The people stopped the ritual not because they understood the truth or loved him, but because they were "greatly terrified" (*da jingkong*).
*   **Hierarchy of Governance:**
    *   **Zi Jian** represents the ideal Confucian ruler (Rule by Virtue), where morality is internalized.
    *   **Zi Chan** represents the wise administrator (Rule by Wisdom), where competence prevents fraud.
    *   **Ximen Bao** represents the Legalist-style ruler (Rule by Law/Fear), where strict enforcement ensures compliance.
*   **Contextual Fairness:** While Confucian tradition might rank Zi Jian highest, the comment is fair in acknowledging that Ximen Bao's "fear-based" approach was the *only* effective tool for his specific situation. The corruption in Ye was entrenched and violent; gentle persuasion (Zi Jian) or mere wisdom (Zi Chan) might not have stopped the priests and elders immediately. Ximen Bao's harshness was a necessary corrective for a specific crisis.
*   **Conclusion:** The comment is fair because it does not necessarily declare one "best" in all contexts, but rather highlights that effective governance requires different tools for different problems. However, it subtly suggests that while Ximen Bao was an "excellent official" (*xian daifu*), his method (fear) is a lower form of governance compared to the moral influence of Zi Jian.
