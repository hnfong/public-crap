Bao discovers that the local officials and magistrates are forcing young women to be sacrificed to the river to appease the river god, and he decides to put an end to this practice. He uses his wit and cunning to outsmart the officials and magistrates, and eventually, he orders the execution of the officials involved. Afterward, he uses the river to irrigate the land, bringing prosperity to the people.

**Q2: What kind of women were usually the victims in the story (2 points)**

The victims were usually young women, often chosen from the poor and widowed families, who were forced to be sacrificed to the river to appease the river god.

**Q3: Who were deemed to benefit from the old practice of offering girls? (2 points)**

The practice of offering girls benefited the officials and magistrates who were involved in the ritual, as well as the river god, who was appeased by the sacrifices.

**Q4: Did the protagonist use wits or force to deal with the situation? Explain (5 points)**

The protagonist, Ximen Bao, used a combination of both wit and force to deal with the situation. Initially, he used his wit to gather information and understand the extent of the practice, and then he used force to execute the officials involved. He also used his cunning to outsmart the officials and magistrates, and eventually, he used the river to irrigate the land, bringing prosperity to the people.

**Q5: Was it moral for the protagonist to do so? Briefly provide views from various perspectives (10 points)**

The morality of Ximen Bao's actions is a matter of debate. From a utilitarian perspective, his actions brought prosperity to the people and ended the cruel practice of sacrificing young women. However, from a deontological perspective, his actions were morally wrong as he used force and coercion to achieve his goals. Some might argue that he was justified in taking drastic measures to end the practice, while others might see it as a violation of human rights and dignity. Additionally, some might argue that he should have tried to find alternative solutions that did not involve violence and coercion.

**Q6: At the end of 滑稽列传, it is said: "傳曰：「子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。」三子之才能誰最賢哉？辨治者當能別之." -- explain what it means, and whether the comment is fair. (15 points)

The comment suggests that Ximen Bao's ability to rule is superior to that of his brothers, who are implied to have ruled in different ways. The comment implies that Ximen Bao's ability to rule is characterized by his ability to avoid deceiving the people, whereas his brothers are said to have been deceived by the people. This comment is fair in that it highlights Ximen Bao's ability to rule with integrity and honesty, which is a key aspect of his character. However, it is also a subjective evaluation that may not be entirely objective. Additionally, the comment may be biased towards Ximen Bao's actions, as it does not mention his use of force and coercion to achieve his goals. [end of text]
