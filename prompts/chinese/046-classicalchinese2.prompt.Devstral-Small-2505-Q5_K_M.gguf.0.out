(1) Translation:

Wei Wu Hou was planning something and his plan was correct, but none of his ministers could match him. After the court session, he had a happy expression. Wu Qi approached and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhao of Chu?" Wei Wu Hou asked, "What did King Zhao of Chu say?" Wu Qi replied, "King Zhao of Chu planned something and his plan was correct, but none of his ministers could match him. After the court session, he had a worried expression. Shen Gong Wu Shen approached and asked, 'Your Majesty, why do you have a worried expression after the court session?' King Zhao said, 'I planned something and my plan was correct, but none of my ministers could match me. This is why I am worried. As the saying goes, 'When a ruler finds a teacher, he becomes a king; when he finds a friend, he becomes a hegemon; when he finds someone to doubt, he survives; when he thinks he is the best and no one can match him, he perishes.' Now, with my lack of virtue, and none of my ministers can match me, my country is almost doomed! This is why I am worried.' King Zhao of Chu worried, but you are happy." Wei Wu Hou hesitated and bowed twice, saying, "Heaven has sent you, Master, to correct my mistakes."

(2) Moral of the story:

The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should be humble and concerned about the lack of capable ministers, rather than being proud and complacent. A ruler who thinks he is the best and no one can match him is likely to lead his country to ruin. The story emphasizes the importance of having capable ministers and the dangers of overconfidence.

(3) Counterpart in Western thought:

The concepts in the story have counterparts in Western thought. For example, the idea that a ruler should be humble and concerned about the lack of capable ministers is similar to the concept of "virtue ethics" in Western philosophy, which emphasizes the importance of moral character and virtues such as humility, wisdom, and courage. The idea that a ruler who thinks he is the best and no one can match him is likely to lead his country to ruin is similar to the concept of "hubris" in Greek mythology, which refers to excessive pride and self-confidence that leads to one's downfall. Additionally, the idea that a ruler should have capable ministers is similar to the concept of "meritocracy" in Western political thought, which emphasizes the importance of appointing officials based on their abilities and qualifications.
