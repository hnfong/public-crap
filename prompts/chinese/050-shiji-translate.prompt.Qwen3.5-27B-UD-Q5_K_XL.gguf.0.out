"Biography of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang"

Zhang the Tingwei, Shizhi, was a man of Duyang, styled Ji. He lived with his elder brother Zhong. Appointed as a Cavalry Lang due to his wealth, he served Emperor Xiaowen for ten years without promotion and remained unknown. Shizhi said, "Long service has diminished Zhong's estate; I cannot succeed." He wished to resign and return home. The Zhonglang Jiang Yuan Ang, knowing his worth and regretting his departure, requested that Shizhi be transferred to fill the position of Yezhe. After Shizhi had finished his audience, he spoke on matters of immediate benefit. Emperor Wen said, "Keep it low; do not speak too highly, but propose what can be implemented now." Thus Shizhi spoke for a long time on matters between the Qin and Han, explaining why Qin lost and why Han rose. Emperor Wen praised him and appointed Shizhi as Yezhe Puye.

Shizhi accompanied the Emperor and ascended the Tiger Enclosure. The Emperor asked the Shanglin Wei about the registers of various beasts; after more than ten questions, the Wei looked left and right and could answer none. The Tiger Enclosure Sifu, standing nearby, answered the Emperor's questions about the beast registers in great detail, wishing to display his ability to respond orally with endless readiness. Emperor Wen said, "Should not officials be like this? The Wei is useless!" He then ordered Shizhi to appoint the Sifu as Shanglin Ling. Shizhi stepped forward and said, "Your Majesty, how do you regard Jiahou Zhou Bo?" The Emperor said, "A virtuous elder." He asked again, "And Dongyanghou Zhang Xiang, how do you regard him?" The Emperor again said, "A virtuous elder." Shizhi said, "Jiahou and Dongyanghou are called virtuous elders; these two men could hardly speak a word on affairs. How could they be compared to this Sifu, who is garrulous, sharp-tongued, and quick-witted! Moreover, Qin relied on clerks skilled in writing; officials competed to excel in speed and harsh scrutiny. Yet the result was merely empty formalities, lacking true compassion. Therefore, their faults went unheard, and the state declined until the Second Emperor, when the empire crumbled. Now, if Your Majesty promotes this Sifu solely for his eloquence, I fear the whole world will follow suit, competing in empty talk without substance. Furthermore, the lower imitates the upper faster than an echo follows a sound; every action must be carefully considered." Emperor Wen said, "Good." He then stopped and did not appoint the Sifu.

The Emperor entered his carriage, summoned Shizhi to ride with him, and proceeded slowly, asking Shizhi about the faults of Qin. Shizhi answered fully and truthfully. Upon reaching the palace, the Emperor appointed Shizhi as Gongche Ling.

Shortly after, the Crown Prince and the King of Liang entered the court together in one carriage without dismounting at the Sima Gate. Shizhi pursued and stopped them, forbidding entry to the palace gates. He then impeached them for failing to dismount at the public gate, an act of disrespect, and submitted the report. Empress Dowager Bo heard of it. Emperor Wen removed his cap and apologized, saying, "I have not taught my sons carefully." Empress Dowager Bo then sent an envoy with an imperial decree to pardon the Crown Prince and the King of Liang, after which they were allowed to enter. Emperor Wen thus regarded Shizhi as extraordinary and appointed him Zhongdaifu.

Shortly after, he became Zhonglang Jiang. Accompanying the Emperor to Baling, they sat facing north overlooking a latrine. At that time, Lady Shen accompanied them. The Emperor pointed out the Xinfeng Road to Lady Shen, saying, "This is the road to Handan." He had Lady Shen play the se, while he leaned on the se and sang, his mood sorrowful and melancholy. Turning to his ministers, he said, "Alas! If we use stones from Beishan for the outer coffin, fill the space with hemp and cotton, and seal it with lacquer, could it possibly be moved?" Those around him all said, "Good." Shizhi stepped forward and said, "If there is anything desirable inside, even if sealed with the Southern Mountain, there will still be a crack; if there is nothing desirable inside, even without a stone coffin, what need for sorrow?" Emperor Wen praised him. Later, Shizhi was appointed Tingwei.

Shortly after, the Emperor went out through the Middle Wei Bridge. A man emerged from under the bridge, startling the imperial horses. The Emperor ordered cavalry to arrest him and hand him over to the Tingwei. Shizhi investigated and questioned him. The man said, "I am a county resident. Hearing the imperial procession, I hid under the bridge. After a long time, thinking the procession had passed, I came out, saw the imperial carriage and cavalry, and ran." The Tingwei sentenced him: one person violating the imperial procession, punishable by a fine. Emperor Wen was angry and said, "This man personally startled my horse. Fortunately, my horse was gentle; had it been another horse, would it not have injured me? Yet the Tingwei sentences him only to a fine!" Shizhi said, "The law is what the Son of Heaven shares with the world. Now the law is thus, yet to increase the penalty is to make the law untrustworthy to the people. Moreover, at that moment, if Your Majesty had ordered immediate execution, it would have been done. Now that the case is with the Tingwei, the Tingwei is the balance of the world. If it tilts once, all application of law throughout the world will become arbitrary; where will the people place their hands and feet? May Your Majesty examine this." After a long time, the Emperor said, "The Tingwei's judgment is correct."

Later, someone stole a jade ring from before the seat in the High Temple. He was captured, and Emperor Wen, enraged, sent the case to the Tingwei for trial. Shizhi, according to the law, reported that stealing items used by the imperial ancestral temple warrants execution by beheading in the market. The Emperor was furious and said, "This man is utterly without principle, stealing vessels from the late Emperor's temple. I sent him to the Tingwei intending to have his whole clan exterminated, yet you submit a judgment based only on the law. This is not in accordance with my intention to honor the ancestral temple." Shizhi removed his cap, bowed his head to the ground, and apologized, saying, "The law is sufficient as it is. Moreover, crimes are equal, but distinguished by whether they are rebellious or obedient. Now, if stealing from the ancestral temple leads to clan extermination, and if one in ten thousand were to do so, suppose a foolish person took a handful of earth from Changling; how would Your Majesty increase the punishment?" After a long time, Emperor Wen discussed it with the Empress Dowager and finally approved the Tingwei's judgment. At that time, the Zhongwei, Tiaohou Zhou Yafu, and the Liang Prime Minister, Shanduhou Wang Tiankai, seeing that Shizhi upheld justice impartially, became his close friends. Zhang the Tingwei was thus praised throughout the world.

Later, Emperor Wen died and Emperor Jing ascended the throne. Shizhi, fearing, claimed illness and wished to resign, dreading severe punishment; yet he wished to appear and apologize but did not know how. Following Wang Sheng's advice, he finally appeared and apologized; Emperor Jing did not hold it against him.

Wang Sheng was a recluse skilled in Huang-Lao teachings. Once summoned to stand in the court while the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers were all assembled, the elderly Wang Sheng said, "My sock has come undone," and turned to Zhang the Tingwei, saying, "Tie my sock for me!" Shizhi knelt and tied it. Afterward, someone said to Wang Sheng, "Why did you humiliate Zhang the Tingwei in court, making him kneel to tie your sock?" Wang Sheng said, "I am old and lowly; I judge that I can never benefit Zhang the Tingwei. Zhang the Tingwei is now a famous minister of the world; I therefore casually humiliated him, making him kneel to tie my sock, intending to enhance his reputation." The nobles heard of this, esteemed Wang Sheng, and held Zhang the Tingwei in even higher regard.

Zhang the Tingwei served Emperor Jing for over a year, then became Prime Minister of the King of Huainan, still regarded as having past faults. After a long time, Shizhi died. His son was Zhang Zhi, styled Changgong, who reached the rank of Dafu but was dismissed. Because he could not accommodate himself to the times, he never held office again.

Feng Tang's great-grandfather was from Zhao. His father moved to Dai. When Han rose, they moved to Anling. Tang was renowned for filial piety and served as Zhonglang Shuzhang under Emperor Wen. When the Emperor passed by in his carriage, he asked Tang, "Old man, why are you a Lang? Where is your home?" Tang answered truthfully. Emperor Wen said, "When I resided in Dai, my Food Supervisor Gao Qu often spoke to me of the virtue of Zhao General Li Qi, who fought under Julu. Now, whenever I eat, my thoughts are never away from Julu. Do you know of him?" Tang replied, "He is not as good as Lian Po and Li Mu as generals." The Emperor asked, "Why?" Tang said, "When my great-grandfather was in Zhao, he served as a commander and was friendly with Li Mu. My father formerly served as Dai Prime Minister and was friendly with Zhao General Li Qi, knowing his character." After hearing of Lian Po and Li Mu, the Emperor was greatly pleased and struck his thigh, saying, "Alas! If only I could have Lian Po and Li Mu as my generals in my time; would I then worry about the Xiongnu?" Tang said, "Your Majesty, even if you obtained Lian Po and Li Mu, you could not employ them." The Emperor became angry, rose, and entered the inner palace. After a long time, he summoned Tang and reproached him, saying, "Why did you humiliate me in public? Could you not have done so in private?" Tang apologized, saying, "I am a rustic man and do not know taboos."

At that time, the Xiongnu had recently invaded Chaona in great force, killing the Beidi Commandant Ang. The Emperor, concerned about the Hu incursions, finally asked Tang again, "How do you know I cannot employ Lian Po and Li Mu?" Tang replied, "I have heard that ancient kings, when sending generals, knelt and pushed the chariot wheel, saying, 'Within the threshold, I control; beyond the threshold, the general controls.' Military merits, ranks, and rewards were all decided in the field and reported upon return. This is not empty talk. My great-grandfather said that when Li Mu was Zhao's general stationed at the border, the taxes from the military market were used entirely to feast the soldiers; rewards were decided in the field without interference from the court. He was entrusted and held responsible for success. Thus Li Mu was able to fully employ his wisdom and ability, dispatching 1,300 chariots, 13,000 cavalry, and 100,000 elite soldiers. Therefore, he drove the Chanyu north, defeated the Eastern Hu, destroyed the Danlin, suppressed the powerful Qin in the west, and supported Han and Wei in the south. At that time, Zhao nearly became hegemon. Later, when Zhao King Qian ascended, whose mother was a courtesan, King Qian, upon ascending, listened to the slander of Guo Kai and finally executed Li Mu, replacing him with Yan Ju. Thus the army was defeated, the soldiers fled, and Zhao was captured and destroyed by Qin. Now I have secretly heard that Wei Shang, as Governor of Yunzhong, used all the military market taxes to feast his soldiers, spent his private funds, and every five days slaughtered an ox to feast guests, military officers, and retainers. Therefore, the Xiongnu stayed far away and did not approach the Yunzhong passes. When the enemy once entered, Shang led his chariots and cavalry to attack them, killing many. The soldiers are all sons of families, recruited from the fields; how could they know the written registers and military codes? Fighting hard all day, beheading and capturing enemies, they submit their merits to the headquarters. If a single word does not correspond, clerks punish them according to law. Rewards are not given, but officials strictly enforce the law. I am foolish, but I believe Your Majesty's laws are too clear, rewards too light, and punishments too heavy. Moreover, Yunzhong Governor Wei Shang was punished for a discrepancy of six heads in his reported merits; Your Majesty handed him to the officials, stripped his rank, and sentenced him to penal labor. From this, it follows that even if Your Majesty obtained Lian Po and Li Mu, you could not employ them. I am truly foolish, have offended taboos, and deserve death, death!" Emperor Wen was pleased. That day, he ordered Feng Tang to hold the imperial tally, pardon Wei Shang, restore him as Governor of Yunzhong, and appointed Tang as Cheqi Duwei, in charge of the Zhongwei and the chariot and foot soldiers of the commanderies and kingdoms.

In the seventh year, Emperor Jing ascended and appointed Tang as Prime Minister of Chu, later dismissing him. When Emperor Wu ascended and sought virtuous and talented men, Feng Tang was recommended. Tang was then over ninety years old and could no longer serve as an official; thus, his son Feng Sui was appointed as a Lang. Sui, styled Wangsun, was also an extraordinary man and was friendly with me.

The Grand Historian says: Zhang Ji's words on virtuous elders show adherence to law without pandering; Feng Gong's discourse on generals is profound! Profound! As the saying goes, "If you do not know a person, look at his friends." The two gentlemen's praises are worthy of being inscribed in the halls of state. The Book of Documents says, "Not partial, not factional, the royal way is broad; not factional, not partial, the royal way is clear." Zhang Ji and Feng Gong come close to this. [end of text]
