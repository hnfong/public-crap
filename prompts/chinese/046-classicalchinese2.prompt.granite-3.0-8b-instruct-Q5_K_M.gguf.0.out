This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

(1) Translation:

The Marquis of Wei was planning something, but none of his ministers could figure it out. He returned to his palace with a satisfied expression. Wu Qi said, "I've also heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu. Did you hear them too?" The Marquis of Wei asked, "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?" Wu Qi replied, "King Zhuang of Chu was planning something, but none of his ministers could figure it out. He returned to his palace with a worried expression. The palace attendant asked, 'Your Majesty, why are you worried?' King Zhuang of Chu said, 'I'm worried because I'm planning something, but none of my ministers can figure it out. This reminds me of a saying: 'A ruler who gets a good general becomes a king, who gets a good friend becomes a tyrant, who gets a good advisor becomes a survivor. A ruler who plans something but none of his ministers can figure it out will lead to the downfall of his country.' I'm worried because I'm planning something, but none of my ministers can figure it out.' King Zhuang of Chu was worried, but you are satisfied." The Marquis of Wei then walked around and said again, "Heaven's angel, Master Zhuang, is correcting my mistakes."

(2) Moral of the story:

The moral of the story is that a leader should not keep their plans a secret from their ministers, as this can lead to the downfall of the country. It is important for a leader to trust and involve their ministers in decision-making processes.

(3) Counterpart in Western thought:

The concept of a leader keeping their plans a secret from their ministers and the potential consequences of this action is not unique to Chinese thought. In Western thought, this concept is often referred to as the "wisdom of crowds" or the idea that a group of people can make better decisions than a single individual. This concept is often used to argue for the importance of transparency and inclusivity in decision-making processes. [end of text]
