### (1) English Translation:  

**Xunzi's Passage:**  

The Marquis Wu of Wei deliberated on state affairs with such skill that none of his ministers could match him. After court was dismissed, he wore a pleased expression. Wu Qi approached him and said, “Has Your Majesty ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu spoken among your attendants?”  

The Marquis asked, “What did King Zhuang of Chu say?”  

Wu Qi replied, “King Zhuang of Chu once deliberated on state affairs so well that none of his ministers could equal him. Yet after court was dismissed, he wore a worried expression. Duke Shen Wuchen approached and asked, ‘Why does Your Majesty look troubled after court?’  

King Zhuang said, ‘Because I alone devise plans well, and none of my ministers can match me—this is why I am troubled. There is a saying from Zhong Hui: *"A ruler who finds teachers among the feudal lords becomes a true king; one who finds friends among them becomes a hegemon; one who finds doubters survives; but one who acts alone, with no one his equal, will perish."* Now, with my lack of virtue, if none of my ministers can match me, my state is close to ruin! That is why I am troubled.’  

King Zhuang of Chu was troubled by this, yet Your Majesty is pleased.”  

Upon hearing this, the Marquis Wu of Wei hesitated, then bowed twice and said, “Heaven has sent you, Master, to awaken me to my fault.”

### (2) Moral of the Story:  

The story teaches that a wise ruler should **value and seek counsel from capable ministers** rather than pride themselves on being the sole source of wisdom.  

- **Humility in Leadership:** King Zhuang of Chu recognizes that if no one in his court can challenge or improve his decisions, it is a sign of weakness, not strength. A ruler surrounded only by inferiors risks isolation and poor governance.  
- **Dangers of Complacency:** The Marquis Wu of Wei initially feels proud of outshining his ministers, but Wu Qi warns him that this mindset leads to decline. True leadership requires humility and the ability to rely on others’ wisdom.  
- **Collective Wisdom > Individual Brilliance:** The quote from Zhong Hui emphasizes that a ruler’s success depends on whether they have mentors (*teachers*), allies (*friends*), or even critics (*doubters*). Ruling alone without equals leads to ruin.

### (3) Western (European) Counterparts:  

Yes, similar ideas appear in Western thought:  

1. **Plato’s "Philosopher-King" vs. Counsel:**  
   - In *The Republic*, Plato argues that the ideal ruler should be wise but also open to philosophical guidance. A tyrant who rules alone, without checks, leads the state to ruin (similar to Zhong Hui’s warning).  

2. **Machiavelli’s *The Prince*:**  
   - Machiavelli advises rulers to **seek wise advisors** but warns against relying too much on them or letting them overshadow the prince. The balance mirrors the tension in Xunzi’s story.  

3. **Aristotle’s *Politics*:**  
   - Aristotle critiques tyranny as the worst form of government because the tyrant rules alone, ignoring the collective wisdom of the polity. He praises mixed constitutions where rulers consult others.  

4. **Roman Notions of *Auctoritas*:**  
   - Roman leaders like Augustus relied on a network of advisors (the Senate, magistrates) to legitimize decisions. The idea that “no one is wiser than all of us” (*Senatus Populusque Romanus*) aligns with Xunzi’s lesson.  

5. **Medieval “Mirror for Princes” Literature:**  
   - Works like *The Book of the Courtier* (Castiglione) or Erasmus’ *Education of a Christian Prince* stress that a good ruler must listen to wise counselors and avoid arrogance.  

**Conclusion:** The story’s core idea—that a leader must surround themselves with capable people to avoid downfall—is universal, appearing in both Eastern and Western political philosophy. The specific framing (teachers → kingship, friends → hegemony) is distinct to Chinese thought, but the warning against solitary rule resonates across cultures. [end of text]
