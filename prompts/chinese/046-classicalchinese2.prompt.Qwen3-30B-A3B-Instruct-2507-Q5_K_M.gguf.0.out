### **(1) English Translation**

Wei Wu Hou planned something well, and his decisions were sound. None of his ministers could match him. After the court session ended, he returned with a look of joy on his face. Wu Qi stepped forward and said:  
"Have you ever heard the words of Chu Zhuang Wang spoken by those around him?"  

Wei Wu Hou replied:  
"What did Chu Zhuang Wang say?"  

Wu Qi answered:  
"Once, when Chu Zhuang Wang planned something well and his decisions were sound, none of his ministers could match him. After the court session ended, he returned with a look of worry on his face. Shen Gong Wuchen approached and asked: 'Why do you look worried after a successful session?'  

Chu Zhuang Wang replied:  
'Because I am not worthy, yet none of my ministers can match me. That is why I am worried. I recall the words from the inner chamber: “A ruler who finds a teacher will become king; one who finds a friend will become hegemon; one who finds a doubter will survive; but one who thinks himself unmatched by anyone will perish.” Now, because I am so unworthy, and yet none of my ministers can match me, our state is nearly doomed. That is why I am worried.'  

Chu Zhuang Wang was concerned, yet you are joyful."  

Wei Wu Hou hesitated, then bowed twice and said:  
"God has sent you, Master Wu, to correct my faults."

### **(2) Moral of the Story**

The central **moral** of this story is:

> **True wisdom and leadership lie not in being superior to others, but in recognizing one’s own limitations and being humble enough to seek guidance, criticism, and collaboration.**

Wei Wu Hou, though successful in his decisions, takes pride in his superiority over his ministers — a sign of arrogance. Wu Qi uses the example of Chu Zhuang Wang, who, despite being equally capable, *feels concern* because he understands the danger of self-satisfaction. He knows that when no one dares to challenge you, you are no longer growing — you are isolated, and your rule is at risk.

Thus, the story teaches:
- **Pride in one’s own competence is dangerous.**
- **A wise ruler welcomes dissent and humility.**
- **The ability to learn from others — even subordinates — is the mark of true strength.**
- **Self-awareness and fear of overconfidence are essential for long-term survival and virtue.**

This reflects a core theme in *Xunzi*: human nature is not inherently good, and moral cultivation requires constant effort, self-reflection, and the guidance of wise teachers and virtuous advisors.

### **(3) Counterpart in Western (European) Thought**

Yes, the concepts in this story have **strong parallels in Western philosophical and political thought**, particularly in the following traditions:

#### ✅ **1. Socratic Irony and the "Know-Nothing" Wisdom (Socrates)**
- Socrates famously claimed he knew nothing — not because he was ignorant, but because he recognized the limits of his knowledge.
- His method of questioning (elenchus) exposed the ignorance of others, especially those who were confident in their own wisdom.
- This mirrors Chu Zhuang Wang’s concern: *“If no one can challenge me, I must be wrong.”*  
- Like Wu Qi’s lesson, Socrates taught that **true wisdom begins with recognizing one’s own ignorance**.

> *“I know that I know nothing.”* — Socrates (as reported by Plato)

#### ✅ **2. Machiavelli’s *The Prince* – The Danger of Isolation**
- In *The Prince*, Machiavelli warns that a ruler who is too isolated, surrounded only by flatterers, is in grave danger.
- He advises that a prince must have honest advisors who can speak truth to power — even if it’s unpleasant.
- This echoes Wu Qi’s point: **a ruler who is never challenged is not powerful — he is vulnerable.**

> “A prince should not be afraid of being called cruel, but he must avoid being hated.”  
> — Machiavelli, *The Prince*, Chapter 17

#### ✅ **3. The "Crisis of Confidence" in Leadership (Modern Leadership Theory)**
- Contemporary leadership studies emphasize **emotional intelligence**, **humility**, and **psychological safety** in organizations.
- Leaders who are open to feedback, admit mistakes, and encourage dissent are more effective and resilient.
- This is the essence of **servant leadership** (Robert Greenleaf) and **adaptive leadership** (Heifetz & Linsky).

#### ✅ **4. The "Tragedy of the Hero" in Greek Tragedy**
- In Greek tragedy, the downfall of heroes like Oedipus or Agamemnon often stems from **hubris** — excessive pride.
- Their downfall comes not from external forces, but from their own belief that they are above criticism or fate.
- This is exactly the danger Wei Wu Hou represents: **his joy is the seed of his downfall.**

> *“Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall.”* — Proverbs 16:18 (Biblical, but widely echoed in Western thought)

### **Conclusion**

The story from *Xunzi* is not just a historical anecdote — it’s a timeless lesson in **leadership humility**, **self-awareness**, and the **dangers of unchecked confidence**. Its core message resonates deeply across cultures and centuries, finding echoes in:
- Socratic philosophy,
- Machiavellian realism,
- Classical tragedy,
- And modern leadership theory.

It reminds us: **The greatest sign of strength is not being unmatched — but being willing to be challenged.**
