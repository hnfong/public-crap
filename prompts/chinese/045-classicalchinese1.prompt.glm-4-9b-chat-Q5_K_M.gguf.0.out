Q1: The story is about西门豹, the magistrate of Ye during the reign of King Wen of Wei, who exposes and stops the harmful practice of sacrificing young women to the river god. He uses wit and force to dismantle the corrupt system, leading to the prosperity of the people.

Q2: The victims were usually young women, often from poor families, who were chosen to be "married" to the river god.

Q3: The old practice benefited the three elders, the officials, and the wizards, who collected money from the people and kept most of it for themselves.

Q4:西门豹 used a combination of wit and force. He first feigned agreement with the practice, then used it to his advantage by publicly executing the wizards and elders, demonstrating his power and resolve.

Q5: From a moral perspective, some might argue that西门豹的行为 was justified because he was ending a harmful and oppressive tradition. Others might criticize him for using violence, while still others might view it as a necessary measure to protect the people from exploitation.

Q6: The comment implies that 子產, 子賤, and 西門豹三位治理者的才能各有所长，其中西门豹以让民众不敢欺骗而最为贤明。This comment is fair as it highlights the effectiveness of each leader's approach in maintaining order and respect among their people. [end of text]
