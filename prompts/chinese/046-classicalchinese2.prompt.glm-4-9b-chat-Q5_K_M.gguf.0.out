(1) Translation of the story into English:

Wu Wu-Hou was planning matters and was always right, none of his ministers could keep up with him. After the court session, he had a look of joy on his face. Wu Qi, a minister, said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu from those around you?" Wu Wu-Hou replied, "What were King Zhuang of Chu's words like?" Wu Qi answered, "King Zhuang of Chu was always right in his planning, none of his ministers could keep up with him, and after the court session, he had a look of worry on his face. Shen Gong Wuqin asked him, 'Why do you look worried when the court session is over?' King Zhuang of Chu said, 'When I plan matters and am always right, none of my ministers can keep up with me, and that is why I am worried. As the saying goes, 'Among the feudal lords, those who have a teacher become kings, those who have friends become lords, those who have doubts survive, and those who plan for themselves and think no one can surpass them will perish.' Now, with my unworthiness, none of my ministers can keep up with me, is our country on the verge of perishing? That is why I am worried.' King Zhuang of Chu was worried, but you are joyful." Wu Wu-Hou hesitated and bowed twice, saying, "It is heaven that sends you, the great teacher, to correct my mistakes."

(2) Explanation of the moral of the story:

The moral of the story is that self-satisfaction can be dangerous and that humility and the recognition of one's own limitations are crucial for the survival and prosperity of a state. Wu Wu-Hou's joy in his own perceived superiority over his ministers is contrasted with King Zhuang of Chu's worry, which stems from his realization that his own abilities might be the downfall of his kingdom if his ministers cannot keep up with him. The story teaches that a leader should be humble and concerned about the abilities and opinions of their advisors, rather than becoming complacent and overconfident.

(3) Counterparts in Western (European) thought:

The concepts in the story have counterparts in Western thought, particularly in the realm of leadership and political philosophy.

- The idea of a leader who is overconfident and does not seek advice or recognize the limitations of their own knowledge can be compared to the concept of hubris, a term from Greek mythology and philosophy that refers to excessive pride or self-confidence, often leading to a tragic downfall. This concept is present in the works of ancient Greek philosophers like Aeschylus and Sophocles.

- The emphasis on the importance of advisors and the need for a diverse range of perspectives is reminiscent of the Western political theory of the separation of powers and the need for checks and balances. This concept is foundational in the works of political philosophers like Montesquieu and James Madison.

- The idea that a leader should be humble and self-critical is also reflected in the teachings of many Western religious and philosophical traditions, such as the Christian concept of humility and the Stoic philosophy of self-reflection and self-improvement. [end of text]
