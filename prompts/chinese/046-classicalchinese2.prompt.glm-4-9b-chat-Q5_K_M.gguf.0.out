This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

**Story:**

The Marquis of Wei was good at making decisions, and none of his ministers could keep up with him. After the meeting, he showed a happy expression. Wu Qi, a minister, said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu from those around you?" The Marquis of Wei asked, "What were King Zhuang of Chu's words like?" Wu Qi replied, "King Zhuang of Chu was good at making decisions, and none of his ministers could keep up with him. After the meeting, he showed a worried expression. Shen Gong Wuqin asked, 'Why do you look worried after the meeting?' King Zhuang of Chu said, 'I make good decisions, but none of my ministers can keep up with me. Therefore, I am worried. As the saying goes, 'Among the feudal lords, those who have their own teachers will be kings, those who have friends will be dukes, those who have doubts will survive, and those who only think of themselves and do not consider others will perish.' Now, with my unworthiness, none of my ministers can keep up with me. Is our country on the verge of perishing? That is why I am worried.' King Zhuang of Chu was worried, but you are happy." The Marquis of Wei hesitated and bowed twice, saying, "It is heaven that sends you, the teacher, to correct my mistakes."
