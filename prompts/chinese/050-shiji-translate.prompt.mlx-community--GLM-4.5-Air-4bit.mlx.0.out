The Biography of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang  

Zhang Tingwei Shizhi was a native of Duyang, with the courtesy name Ji. He had an elder brother, Zhong, with whom he lived together. He became a cavalry attendant based on his family's wealth and served Emperor Xiaowen. For ten years, he was not promoted and remained unknown. Shizhi said, "Long service diminishes my brother's property; it is not worth it." He intended to resign and return home. General Yuan Ang, knowing of his virtue, regretted his departure and requested that Shizhi be transferred to serve as a court usher. After the morning court session, Shizhi presented a memorial on practical matters. Emperor Xiaowen said, "Lower your expectations; do not speak of lofty theories that cannot be implemented now." Thereupon, Shizhi spoke of the events between the Qin and Han dynasties, explaining why the Qin lost and the Han rose for a long time. The emperor praised him and appointed Shizhi as the chief usher.  

Shizhi followed the emperor on an excursion to the Tiger Park. The emperor asked the park keeper about the records of the various animals, posing more than ten questions. The keeper glanced around and could not answer any of them. The Tiger Park steward, standing nearby, answered the emperor's questions in great detail on behalf of the keeper, demonstrating his ability to respond fluently and without end. The emperor said, "Is this not how officials should be? The keeper is incompetent!" He then ordered Shizhi to appoint the steward as the commander of the park. Shizhi stepped forward and said, "Your Majesty, how would you describe Marquis Jiang, Zhou Bo?" The emperor replied, "A worthy elder." Shizhi then asked, "And how would you describe Mar Dongyang, Zhang Xianghe?" The emperor again said, "A worthy elder." Shizhi said, "Marquis Jiang and Mar Dongyang are called worthy elders, yet these two men could barely speak when discussing matters. How could they emulate this steward's eloquent and agile tongue? Moreover, the Qin dynasty employed clerks and scribes, who competed in being swift and harsh in their judgments, but this practice led only to empty formalities without genuine compassion. For this reason, faults were not corrected, and the dynasty declined until the time of the Second Emperor, when the realm collapsed. Now, Your Majesty, you are promoting this steward merely for his eloquence. I fear that the world will follow this trend, competing in eloquence without substance. Moreover, the influence of the lower ranks on the upper spreads as swiftly as a shadow follows its form. Actions must be taken with great care." The emperor said, "Well said." He then canceled the appointment of the steward.  

The emperor boarded his chariot and summoned Shizhi to ride alongside him. As they traveled slowly, the emperor asked Shizhi about the faults of the Qin dynasty. Shizhi answered truthfully and in detail. Upon reaching the palace, the emperor appointed Shizhi as the commander of the public carriages.  

Not long after, the Crown Prince and Prince Li entered the court together in the same chariot without dismounting at the Sima Gate. Shizhi pursued them and stopped them from entering the palace gate. He then impeached them for disrespect by not dismounting at the gate and submitted a memorial. Empress Bo heard of this and sent an imperial pardon for the Crown Prince and Prince Li, allowing them to enter. The emperor was thus impressed by Shizhi and appointed him as a grand master.  

Some time later, Shizhi became a general of the palace attendants. He followed the emperor to Baling, where they stood on a northern terrace overlooking a toilet. At that time, Consort Shen was accompanying them. The emperor pointed to the road to Xinfeng and said to her, "This is the road to Handan." He had Consort Shen play the zither while he leaned on it and sang, his mood sorrowful and melancholic. He turned to the courtiers and said, "Alas! If I were to carve my coffin from the northern mountains, line it with silk and hemp, and seal it with lacquer, who could move it!" Those around him all said, "Excellent." Shizhi stepped forward and said, "If there is something desirable within it, even if it were sealed with Mount Nan, it could still be breached. If there is nothing desirable within it, even without a stone coffin, why should there be sorrow?" The emperor praised him. Shortly after, Shizhi was appointed as the grand marshal.  

Not long after, the emperor was traveling across the middle Wei Bridge when a man emerged from under the bridge, frightening the emperor's horses. The emperor ordered his cavalry to capture the man and hand him over to the grand marshal. Shizhi interrogated him and learned that the man was a county resident who had heard the emperor's approach and hid under the bridge. After a long time, thinking the procession had passed, he came out and saw the emperor's chariot and retinue, at which point he fled. The grand marshal, according to the law, ruled that the crime of disturbing the emperor's passage warranted a fine of gold. The emperor was enraged and said, "This man frightened my horses directly. My horses are gentle, but if they were another breed, would they not have injured me? Yet the grand marshal only fines him!" Shizhi said, "The law is what the emperor shares with the world. If the law is thus and yet we加重 it, the people will not trust the law. Moreover, at that moment, had the emperor executed him on the spot, it would have been over. Now that he has been handed to the grand marshal, who is the impartial judge of the realm, if the judgment is swayed, all legal applications in the realm will become inconsistent. Where will the people turn? I ask only that Your Majesty consider this." After a long while, the emperor said, "The grand marshal is right."  

Later, someone stole a jade ring from before the seat of Emperor Gao's temple. The thief was captured, and the emperor, enraged, handed the case to the grand marshal. Shizhi, according to the law, ruled that stealing from the ancestral temple warranted execution by beheading in the marketplace. The emperor was furious and said, "This man's audacity! He dared to steal from the temple of my predecessor. I handed him to you to have his entire clan executed, yet you judge him by the law alone. This is not in the spirit of jointly upholding our ancestral temple!" Shizhi removed his cap, kowtowed, and apologized, saying, "The law is sufficient as it is. Moreover, crimes are graded by severity. If stealing from the ancestral temple warrants execution of the clan, then what punishment would you give to a foolish commoner who scoops a handful of earth from Emperor Gao's tomb?" After a long time, the emperor discussed the matter with the empress dowager and agreed to the grand marshal's judgment. At that time, Commandant Tiao, Mar Zhou Yafu, and the chancellor of Liang, Mar Wang Tainkai, admired Shizhi's impartial judgment and became his close friends. Thus, Zhang Tingwei was praised throughout the realm.  

After Emperor Wen died, Emperor Jing ascended the throne. Shizhi, fearing for his life, feigned illness. He wished to resign but feared execution; he wished to apologize but did not know how. Following the advice of Wang Sheng, he eventually did apologize, but Emperor Jing did not punish him.  

Wang Sheng was a recluse skilled in the teachings of Huang-Lao. Once, when summoned to the court, all the high officials were present. Wang Sheng, being old, said, "My socks are loose," and turned to Zhang Tingwei, "Tie them for me!" Shizhi knelt and tied them for him. Afterwards, someone asked Wang Sheng, "Why did you humiliate Zhang Tingwei in court, making him kneel to tie your socks?" Wang Sheng said, "I am old and of low status, and I knew I could never benefit Zhang Tingwei. But he is a renowned minister of the realm today, so I humbled him slightly, hoping to elevate his stature." When the other officials heard this, they praised Wang Sheng and respected Zhang Tingwei even more.  

Zhang Tingwei served Emperor Jing for over a year before being appointed as the chancellor of the Prince of Huainan, likely due to past grievances. After a long time, Shizhi died. His son, Zhang Zhi, courtesy name Changgong, served as a grand master but was later dismissed. He never held office again because he could not please the court of his time.  

Feng Tang's grandfather was a native of Zhao. His father moved to Dai. After the rise of the Han, they moved to Anling. Tang was known for his filial piety and served as the chief of the central palace attendants under Emperor Wen. Once, when the emperor passed by in his sedan chair, he asked Tang, "Old man, why are you serving as an attendant? Where is your home?" Tang answered truthfully. The emperor said, "When I was in Dai, my food supervisor, Gao Qu, often spoke to me of the virtue of the Zhao general Li Qi, who fought at Julu. Now, whenever I eat, my thoughts are never far from Julu. Do you know of him?" Tang replied, "He was not as great as Lian Po or Li Mu as a general." The emperor asked, "Why?" Tang said, "My grandfather, while serving in Zhao, was a military commander and was acquainted with Li Mu. My father was the chancellor of Dai and knew the Zhao general Li Qi personally." After hearing of Lian Po and Li Mu, the emperor was pleased and slapped his thigh, saying, "Alas! If only I had Lian Po or Li Mu as my generals now, would I still fear the Xiongnu?" Tang said, "Your Majesty, even if you had Lian Po or Li Mu, you could not employ them." The emperor, angered, rose and entered the palace. After a long time, he summoned Tang and rebuked him, saying, "Why do you humiliate me so publicly? Is there no private place for this?" Tang apologized, saying, "I am a simple man and unaware of taboos."  

At that time, the Xiongnu had just invaded Chaona and killed the Northern Commandant, Yin. The emperor was concerned by the barbarian invasion and again asked Tang, "How do you know I cannot employ Lian Po or Li Mu?" Tang replied, "I have heard that in ancient times, when kings dispatched generals, they would kneel and push their chariot, saying, 'Within the capital gates, I control matters; beyond them, the general is in command.' Military rewards and honors were decided by the general and reported upon return. This was not mere words. My grandfather said that when Li Mu was the Zhao general on the frontier, the taxes from the military market were used to feast his soldiers, and rewards were decided by him without interference from the capital. Entrusted with full authority and held accountable for success, Li Mu was able to use his abilities to the fullest. He dispatched 1,300 chariots, 13,000 cavalry, and 100,000 elite soldiers, driving the Xiongnu north, defeating the Donghu, destroying the Danlin, suppressing the strong Qin state to the west, and resisting Han and Wei to the south. At that time, Zhao nearly became hegemonic. Later, when King Qian ascended the throne, his mother was a courtesan. King Qian, influenced by the slander of Guo Kai, executed Li Mu and replaced him with Yan Ju. As a result, the army was defeated and scattered, and Zhao was conquered and destroyed by Qin. Now, I have heard that Wei Shang is the governor of Yunzhong. The taxes from his military market are all used to feast his soldiers. He personally funds feasts for his officers and attendants every five days. For this reason, the Xiongnu avoid his territory and do not approach the Yunzhong passes. Once, when the invaders entered, Shang led his chariots and cavalry to attack them, killing many. His soldiers are all commoners, recruited from the fields, and know nothing of military regulations. They fight all day, capturing enemies and reporting to the headquarters, but if their accounts do not match, the clerks punish them by law. Their rewards are not granted, yet the officials strictly enforce the law. I believe, Your Majesty, that your laws are too strict, rewards too light, and punishments too heavy. Moreover, the governor of Yunzhong, Wei Shang, was demoted and sentenced to penal labor because his report of enemy kills was off by six. From this, I say that even if you had Lian Po or Li Mu, you could not employ them. I am indeed foolish and have offended taboos; I deserve death!" The emperor was pleased. That day, he ordered Feng Tang to carry a tally and pardon Wei Shang, restoring him as the governor of Yunzhong, and appointed Tang as the commander of the chariots and cavalry, overseeing the central command and the charioteers of the commanderies and kingdoms.  

In the seventh year of the reign, Emperor Jing ascended the throne and appointed Tang as the chancellor of Chu, but he was later dismissed. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne, he sought worthy men and recommended Feng Tang. Tang was then over ninety years old and could not serve in office again, so his son, Feng Sui, was made an attendant. Sui, courtesy name Wangsun, was also a remarkable man and was a friend of mine.  

The Grand Historian comments: Zhang Ji's words on the worthy, upholding the law without favor; Feng Gong's discussion of generals, how profound! How profound! As the saying goes, "To know a man, observe his friends." The praise these two men received is worthy of being inscribed in the imperial court. The Book of Documents says, 'Without bias or partisanship, the kingly way is broad; without partisanship or bias, the kingly way is smooth.' Zhang Ji and Feng Gong came close to this ideal.
