Q1: The story describes how西门豹, as the governor of Ye, discovered that the local people were suffering due to a tradition of offering a girl to the river god as a sacrifice. The elders explained that this practice had become a source of poverty because the local officials would exploit the event to enrich themselves. When西门豹 demanded an explanation, he learned that the officials would select a beautiful girl from the community, prepare her for the ritual, and then throw her into the river. This led to many families fleeing, leaving the city empty and increasingly impoverished. To address this issue,西门豹 pretended to follow the ritual but then threw the local witches into the river instead of the chosen girl. He then had the officials build twelve canals to irrigate the fields, bringing prosperity to the people.

Q2: The victims in the story were the local girls who were chosen to be sacrificed to the river god and often forced to flee their homes due to the threat of being taken by the witches.

Q3: Those who benefited from the old practice were the local officials, witches, and possibly some wealthy individuals who profited from the exploitation of the people.

Q4:西门豹 used both wit and force to deal with the situation. He first pretended to go along with the ritual to gain the trust of the locals, then used the opportunity to expose and punish the corrupt officials. He also showed his authority by throwing the witches into the river and ordering the construction of the canals, demonstrating his ability to solve problems effectively.

Q5: The morality of西门豹's actions is a matter of debate. On one hand, he prevented further harm to the local people and ended a harmful tradition. On the other hand, his methods were extreme and may be seen as cruel. Some might argue that his actions were necessary to bring about positive change, while others might criticize his lack of mercy.

Q6: The comment from the end of the text compares the three rulers (Zi Chan of Zheng, Zi Qian of Danfu, and Xi Men Bao of Ye) and evaluates their wisdom. It suggests that Zi Chan and Zi Qian were respected for their ability to govern with fairness and kindness, while Xi Men Bao was admired for his effectiveness in solving problems, even if his methods were controversial. The comment suggests that a good ruler should balance wisdom, kindness, and effectiveness in solving problems. [end of text]
