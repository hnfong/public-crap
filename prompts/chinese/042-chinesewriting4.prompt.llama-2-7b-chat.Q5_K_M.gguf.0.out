 [/INST]  As a high school student, I believe that both perspectives on the issue of keeping promises and being responsible have their own merits.
On one hand, some people argue that honoring promises is a sign of integrity and trustworthiness. When someone keeps their word, it shows that they are reliable and can be depended upon, which is crucial in any relationship, whether personal or professional. For instance, if a friend makes a promise to meet you at a certain time, and they show up on time, it builds trust and strengthens the bond between you. Similarly, if a business partner keeps their word regarding a deal, it can lead to a stronger partnership and more successful ventures. In this sense, honoring promises is essential for establishing and maintaining healthy relationships.
On the other hand, there are times when keeping promises is not always possible, and it's important to be responsible and realistic. Life is full of unexpected events and changes, and sometimes, promises must be broken or delayed. For example, a person may make a promise to study for a certain number of hours every day, but if an unexpected family emergency arises, they may have to prioritize their responsibilities and adjust their schedule accordingly. In such cases, being responsible and flexible is crucial to maintaining one's integrity and credibility.
In conclusion, both perspectives on keeping promises are valid, and it's important to strike a balance between being reliable and being responsible. While honoring promises is essential for building trust and strong relationships, there are times when being realistic and flexible is necessary to maintain one's integrity and credibility. As a high school student, I believe that it's important to understand the importance of both perspectives and to develop the skills to navigate these situations in a responsible and ethical manner.
