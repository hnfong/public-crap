The Biography of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang  
Zhang Shizhi, the Commandant of Justice, was a native of Duchang and styled Ji. He lived with his elder brother Zhong. He served as a cavalry officer due to his family’s wealth, attending Emperor Wen of Han. For ten years, he was not promoted and remained unknown. Shizhi said, “Serving as an official for long has depleted my brother’s property. It’s not right.” He wanted to resign and return home. Yuan Ang, the Commandant of the Palace Guards, knowing his virtue and regretting his departure, requested that Shizhi be reassigned as a court usher. After attending court, Shizhi approached and discussed matters of convenience. Emperor Wen said, “Speak more simply, no lofty theories, but what can be implemented now.” Shizhi then discussed the events between Qin and Han, the reasons for Qin’s downfall and Han’s rise, at length. Emperor Wen praised him and appointed him as the Palace Usher.  
Shizhi accompanied the emperor on a tour to the Tiger Enclosure. The emperor asked the Forest Superintendent about the records of the animals, but the superintendent, unable to answer after several questions, looked around helplessly. The enclosure overseer answered the emperor’s questions about the animal records in detail, demonstrating his quick and fluent response. Emperor Wen said, “Shouldn’t officials be like this? The superintendent is useless!” He ordered Shizhi to appoint the overseer as the Forest Superintendent. Shizhi stepped forward and said, “Your Majesty, what do you think of Lord Zhou Bo of Jiang? ” The emperor replied, “A man of virtue.” Shizhi then asked, “And Lord Zhang Cang of Dongyang? ” The emperor again replied, “A man of virtue.” Shizhi said, “Lord Zhou and Lord Zhang are called men of virtue, yet these two often struggled to speak fluently. How could they have learned the glib and quick-tongued manner of this overseer? Moreover, Qin relied on clerks, who competed in harsh and meticulous scrutiny, but their flaw was mere formalism without genuine compassion. Thus, they failed to hear their mistakes and declined until the reign of the Second Emperor, when the empire collapsed. Now, Your Majesty promotes this overseer for his eloquence. I fear the empire will follow suit, competing in empty words without substance. Moreover, the influence of superiors on inferiors is swift. Your actions must be carefully considered.” Emperor Wen said, “Well said.” He stopped the appointment.  
As the emperor boarded his carriage, he summoned Shizhi to ride with him. They traveled slowly, and the emperor asked Shizhi about Qin’s flaws. Shizhi answered truthfully. Upon reaching the palace, the emperor appointed Shizhi as the Commandant of the Palace Gate.  
Shortly after, the Crown Prince and King Liang entered the court in the same carriage without dismounting at the palace gate. Shizhi stopped them and reported their disrespect. Empress Dowager Bo heard of this, and Emperor Wen apologized, saying, “I failed to teach my sons properly.” She sent an envoy to pardon the Crown Prince and King Liang, allowing them to enter. The emperor then regarded Shizhi highly and appointed him as a Palace Attendant.  
Later, Shizhi became the Commandant of the Palace Guards. During a tour to Baoling, the emperor pointed to the road to Xinfeng and said, “This is the road to Handan.” He had Lady Shen play the瑟, and he sang mournfully, lamenting. Turning to his ministers, he said, “If the coffin is made of stone from Mount Beishan and sealed with hemp and lacquer, how could it be moved?” All agreed. Shizhi stepped forward and said, “If there is something desirable inside, even if sealed with Mount Nan, it can be broken into. If there is nothing desirable inside, even without a stone coffin, what is there to fear?” The emperor praised him. He later appointed Shizhi as Commandant of Justice.  
Once, while traveling on the Central Wei Bridge, a man emerged from under the bridge, startling the imperial carriage. The emperor ordered his arrest and handed him to Shizhi. Shizhi investigated and found the man had hidden under the bridge upon hearing the imperial procession and emerged, startling the carriage. Shizhi ruled the man should pay a fine for disturbing the imperial carriage. The emperor was furious, “This man startled my horse. My horse is gentle, but another might have injured me. Yet you only fine him!” Shizhi replied, “The law is shared by the emperor and all under heaven. If the law is changed arbitrarily, it will lose the people’s trust. At the time, if Your Majesty had ordered his execution, it would have been done. Now that it has been handed to me, I must uphold justice. If I waver, how will the empire enforce the law? Your Majesty must consider this.” After a long pause, the emperor said, “You are right.”  
Later, a man stole a jade ring from the shrine of Emperor Gaozu. Shizhi ruled according to the law, sentencing the thief to death. The emperor was furious, “This man is lawless, stealing from the ancestral temple. I entrusted you to punish him severely, yet you follow the law. This is not what I mean by upholding the ancestral temple.” Shizhi removed his hat and bowed, saying, “The law is sufficient. Crimes are judged by severity. If stealing from the ancestral temple warrants extermination, what if a foolish person takes a handful of soil from Changling? How would Your Majesty punish them?” After a long time, the emperor discussed this with Empress Dowager Bo and agreed with Shizhi’s judgment. At the time, Marquis of Tiao, Zhou Yafu of the Central Commandant, and Marquis of Shandu, Wang Tiankai of the Liang Chancellor, admired Shizhi’s fairness and became his close friends. Thus, Commandant Zhang was renowned throughout the empire.  
After Emperor Wen’s death, Emperor Jing ascended the throne. Shizhi, fearing punishment, claimed illness and wanted to resign, fearing execution. He sought to apologize but was unsure how. Following Wang Sheng’s advice, he finally apologized, and Emperor Jing pardoned him.  
Wang Sheng was a scholar of Daoism and a hermit. Once invited to the court, he asked Shizhi to tie his socks in front of the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers. Someone asked Wang Sheng why he humiliated Shizhi, and he replied, “I am old and lowly. I thought to honor Shizhi, a renowned minister, by making him kneel to tie my socks.” The ministers admired Wang Sheng and respected Shizhi.  
Shizhi served Emperor Jing for over a year as the Chancellor of Huainan, still held accountable for his past. He later died. His son, Zhang Zhi, styled Changgong, rose to the rank of Grand Administrator but was dismissed for failing to please the times, never serving again.  
Feng Tang was the grandson of a Zhao native, whose father moved to Dai. During Han, they settled in Anling. Known for filial piety, Feng Tang served as the Chief of the Palace Attendants under Emperor Wen. When the emperor passed by, he asked Feng Tang, “Why are you still a minor official at your age? Where is your home? ” Feng Tang answered truthfully. The emperor said, “When I lived in Dai, Gao Qu, the Imperial Food Supervisor, often spoke of Li Qi, a Zhao general, and his valor at Julu. I think of it often. Do you know of him? ” Feng Tang replied, “He is no match for Lian Po and Li Mu.” The emperor asked why, and Feng Tang recounted his grandfather’s service under Li Mu and his father’s friendship with Li Qi. The emperor, pleased with the stories of Lian Po and Li Mu, sighed, “If only I had generals like them, I would not fear the Xiongnu!” Feng Tang said, “Your Majesty, even with such generals, you could not use them.” The emperor was angry and left. Later, he asked Feng Tang why he thought so. Feng Tang explained that ancient kings entrusted generals with full authority, allowing them to reward and punish without interference. He compared this to Wei Shang, the Governor of Yunzhong, who, like Li Mu, treated his soldiers well but was demoted for a minor error. The emperor was pleased and sent Feng Tang with a decree to pardon Wei Shang and reinstate him as Governor of Yunzhong, appointing Feng Tang as the Commandant of Chariots and Cavalry.  
During Emperor Jing’s reign, Feng Tang was Chancellor of Chu but was dismissed. When Emperor Wu sought virtuous men, Feng Tang was recommended but, being over ninety, could not serve. His son, Feng Sui, styled Wangsun, a remarkable man, became an attendant.  
Sima Qian wrote: Zhang Shizhi’s words on virtue and his adherence to the law without bias; Feng Tang’s discourse on generals—how profound! As the saying goes, “If you wish to know a man, observe his friends.” The praises of these two men are worthy of the halls of government. The Book of Documents says, “Without partiality or partisanship, the royal way is broad and level; without partisanship or partiality, the royal way is straight and just.” Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang came close to this ideal.
