This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

(1) The story is about the King of Wei, who was very pleased with himself when he made a wise decision and his ministers could not catch up with him. But his advisor, Wu Qi, reminded him of a story about the King of Chu. The King of Chu was also wise, but he was worried when he made a wise decision and his ministers could not catch up with him. He believed that a king should have wise advisors around him, or his country would be in danger.

(2) The moral of the story is that a wise leader should always surround themselves with wise advisors. A leader who thinks they are smarter than everyone else and does not listen to others may be putting their country in danger.

(3) The concept of a leader needing wise advisors has parallels in Western (European) thought. For example, the ancient Greek philosopher Plato believed that a wise leader should listen to the advice of others and not rely solely on their own judgment.<｜end▁of▁sentence｜>
