Q1: The story is about a magistrate named 西门豹 who, upon arriving in 邺, learns of a local custom where girls are sacrificed to the river god to prevent flooding. He cleverly exposes the corruption behind this practice and stops it, earning the respect and gratitude of the people.

Q2: The victims were usually young, beautiful girls from poor families.

Q3: The beneficiaries were the local officials, the witch, and the priests who collected money under the guise of the sacrifice.

Q4: The protagonist used wits. He pretended to follow the custom but cleverly exposed the corruption by throwing the witch and her associates into the river, showing the people that the sacrifices were unnecessary.

Q5: From a moral perspective, it could be argued that the protagonist's actions were justified because they stopped a harmful and corrupt practice. However, from a religious perspective, it could be seen as sacrilegious to mock or challenge the river god. From a legal perspective, it could be seen as an abuse of power, but in this case, it was used to benefit the people.

Q6: The comment means that 子产, 子贱, and 西门豹 were all good administrators, but 子产 was the most skilled in governance because he could prevent people from deceiving him, indicating a high level of trust and respect from the people. The comment is fair because it acknowledges the different strengths of each administrator and highlights 子产's exceptional ability to gain the trust of his people. [end of text]
