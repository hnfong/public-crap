**Biography of Zhang Shi and Feng Tang**  

Zhang Shi, courtesy name Ji, was a native of Duyang. He had an elder brother, Zhang Zhong, who lived with him. Zhang Shi served as a Cavalry Knight and attended to Emperor Wen of Han. Despite serving for ten years, he remained unrecognized and unappointed. Zhang Shi said, "Long service has diminished my brother's wealth; I wish to resign and return home."  

Zhonglangjiang Yuan Ang knew of Zhang Shi's virtue and regretted his departure. He petitioned to transfer Zhang Shi to serve as a Gate Attendant. After completing his audience with the emperor, Zhang Shi approached and spoke of matters that would benefit the state. Emperor Wen said, "Speak plainly; do not present overly grand theories that cannot be implemented now." Thus, Zhang Shi spoke of the affairs of the Qin and Han dynasties, analyzing why Qin had fallen and why Han had risen. Emperor Wen praised him and appointed Zhang Shi as a Gate Attendant Prefect.  

When Emperor Wen toured the Tiger Enclosure, he asked the officials in charge of the upper forest about records of game animals. After asking over ten questions, the officials could not respond. The enclosure's steward, standing nearby, answered the questions in detail about the game animals, demonstrating his ability to respond fluently and endlessly. Emperor Wen said, "Are officials not supposed to be like this? You are worthless!" He then ordered Zhang Shi to appoint the steward as the Upper Forest Commandant.  

After Zhang Shi had served for a long time, he said to the emperor, "Your Majesty, how do you compare Emperor Wen of Zhou's Marquis of Jiang and the Marquis of Dongyang Zhang to one another?" Emperor Wen replied, "They were both virtuous men." Zhang Shi said, "These two Marquises were called virtuous because they could not even speak clearly. How could they compare to this steward, who is so eloquent? Moreover, during the Qin dynasty, officials competed to be harsh and meticulous in their inspections, but their efforts were merely superficial. They lacked true compassion. As a result, their faults were not reported, and the empire declined until it reached the second generation of the Qin dynasty, collapsing entirely. Now, Your Majesty promotes this steward for his eloquence, but I fear that the entire empire will follow suit, chasing eloquence without substance. The people will emulate their superiors swiftly, and decisions must be carefully considered." Emperor Wen said, "Well said." He then refrained from appointing the steward.  

When the emperor boarded his carriage, he summoned Zhang Shi to accompany him. As they drove slowly, Emperor Wen asked Zhang Shi about the failures of the Qin dynasty. Zhang Shi provided a detailed and honest account. Upon reaching the palace, Emperor Wen appointed Zhang Shi as the Commandant of the Imperial Carriages.  

Not long after, the Crown Prince and Prince Liang rode together to court but refused to pass through the gate of the Minister of Justice. Zhang Shi stopped them and reported their disrespect. Empress Dowager Bo heard of this and had Emperor Wen remove his crown in apology, saying, "I have failed to teach my sons properly." Empress Dowager Bo then sent an envoy to pardon the Crown Prince and Prince Liang, allowing them to enter the palace. From this, Emperor Wen regarded Zhang Shi with great favor and appointed him as a Central Director.  

Later, Zhang Shi was promoted to Commandant of the Central Guards. While accompanying the emperor to the Mausoleum of Baoling, he stood north of the latrine and pointed to the road to Xinfeng, saying, "This is the road to Handan." He ordered Empress Shen to play the se, then leaned on the se and sang. His expression was somber and sorrowful. He turned to his officials and said, "Alas, if the northern mountains were used as coffins, filled with hemp and shredded silk, and coated with lacquer, would they be movable?" The officials all replied, "Indeed." Zhang Shi stepped forward and said, "If there were something desirable inside, even melting the northern mountains would not stop it. But if there is nothing desirable, even without a stone coffin, what would there be to mourn?" Emperor Wen praised him. Later, Zhang Shi was appointed as the Minister of Justice.  

One day, Emperor Wen was crossing the Middle Wei Bridge when a man emerged from beneath it, startling the emperor's carriage. The man was arrested and brought before the Ministry of Justice. Zhang Shi interrogated him and learned that he was a local man who had hidden under the bridge upon hearing the emperor's entourage pass by. After a long time, he assumed the emperor had already passed and emerged, only to see the carriage and flee.  

Minister of Justice Qin Dang ruled that the man had violated the imperial path and should be fined. Emperor Wen, enraged, said, "This man frightened my horse. My horse is gentle, but if it had been another horse, surely it would not have been injured. And yet the Ministry of Justice fines him!" Zhang Shi replied, "The law is something the emperor shares with the people. If the law is already harsh, making it even harsher would make it untrustworthy among the people. At the time, if Your Majesty had ordered his execution, that would have been sufficient. But now that the case has been referred to the Ministry of Justice, which represents the fairness of the empire, if punishments are inconsistent, the people will not know how to act. Please consider this carefully." After a long silence, Emperor Wen said, "The Minister of Justice is correct."  

Later, someone stole a jade ring from the altar of Emperor Gaozu's temple. The thief was captured, and Emperor Wen ordered the Ministry of Justice to handle the case. Zhang Shi ruled that the thief, who had stolen from the imperial temple, should be executed by discarding his body in the public square. Emperor Wen, enraged, said, "How can such immorality exist? This man stole from the temple of my ancestor, and I, as Minister of Justice, wish to exterminate his clan. Yet you, Zhang Shi, insist on applying the law as written. This is not what I desire in serving the ancestral temple." Zhang Shi removed his hat and bowed to apologize, saying, "The law is sufficient as written. Moreover, the crime is the same, but punishments should vary according to circumstances. If we execute someone for stealing from the imperial temple, what standard will we apply to others? Suppose an ignorant man were to take a handful of earth from the Mausoleum of Changling—how would Your Majesty punish him?" After a long discussion, Emperor Wen discussed the matter with Empress Dowager Bo, and she agreed with Zhang Shi's ruling. At this time, Marshal Zhou Yaofu and Marquis Shandu Wang Tian opened, who approved of Zhang Shi's fair judgment, and they became close friends. From this, Zhang Shi was renowned throughout the empire.  

After Emperor Wen's death, Emperor Jing ascended the throne. Zhang Shi, fearing punishment, claimed to be ill. He wanted to resign but feared severe consequences. He also wanted to apologize but was unsure how to proceed. Using Wang Sheng's strategy, he eventually met with the emperor and apologized. Emperor Jing accepted his apology.  

Wang Sheng, a hermit skilled in Daoist teachings, was once summoned to the court. When the high-ranking officials gathered, Wang Sheng, an old man, said, "Tie my shoelaces," and turned to Zhang Shi, "Tie my shoelaces." Zhang Shi knelt and tied them. Afterward, someone asked Wang Sheng, "Why do you humiliate Zhang Shi like this, making him kneel to tie your shoelaces?" Wang Sheng replied, "I am old and insignificant, and I knew I could not benefit Zhang Shi. Zhang Shi is now a renowned official in the empire. I humbled him to show respect for him." The officials heard this and regarded Wang Sheng as wise and Zhang Shi as highly respected.  

Zhang Shi served Emperor Jing for over a year as the Prime Minister of Huainan but was still held accountable for past offenses. Eventually, Zhang Shi died. His son, Zhang Zhi, courtesy name Changgong, served as a high-ranking official but was exempted from further service. He remained unapproachable in his conduct and never held office again.  

Feng Tang, whose great-grandfather was from Zhao, had a father who moved to Dai. During the early Han dynasty, his family moved to Anying. Feng Tang was known for his filial piety and served as a Central Director under Emperor Wen. When Emperor Wen passed by, he asked Feng Tang, "Why have you become an official? Where is your home?" Feng Tang answered honestly. Emperor Wen said, "When I was in Dai, I often heard from the Director of the Imperial Food Supply, Gao Qu, about General Li Qi of Zhao, who was skilled in battle at Julu. Now, whenever I eat, my thoughts return to Julu. Do you know of this?" Feng Tang replied, "He is not as capable as Generals Lian Po and Li Mu." Emperor Wen asked, "Why?" Feng Tang said, "My great-grandfather served as a general in Zhao and knew General Li Mu well. My father served as the Prime Minister of Dai and knew General Li Qi of Zhao, understanding his character."  

When Emperor Wen heard of Lian Po and Li Mu, he was pleased and exclaimed, "Alas, if only I could have served with Lian Po and Li Mu as my generals, how could I worry about the Xiongnu!" Feng Tang replied, "Your Majesty, even if you obtained Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them." Emperor Wen, angered, entered the palace. After a long time, he summoned Feng Tang and reproached him, "Why do you repeatedly embarrass me in public, with no consideration for my feelings?" Feng Tang apologized, "I am ignorant and unaware of proper decorum."  

At that time, the Xiongnu had recently invaded and killed the Commandant of the Northern Frontier, Wei Ang. Emperor Wen was concerned about the Xiongnu and asked Feng Tang again, "How do you know that I cannot use Lian Po and Li Mu?" Feng Tang replied, "I heard that in ancient times, when kings sent generals to battle, they knelt and pushed the carriage wheels, saying, 'Those within the gates are under my control; those beyond are under the generals' control. Military rewards and punishments are decided outside the capital and reported upon return. This is not empty talk. My great-grandfather said that General Li Mu, serving on the border of Zhao, used the military market revenues to support his troops and reward his soldiers, with decisions made outside the capital. This allowed him to fully utilize his abilities. He was sent 1,300 chariots, 13,000 cavalry, and 100,000 soldiers with gold, driving out the Xiongnu, defeating the Eastern Hu, annihilating the Dandun tribe, suppressing the powerful Qin, and holding off the states of Han and Wei. At that time, Zhao was on the verge of dominance. However, after Emperor Zhao Wang迁 ascended the throne, influenced by his concubine, he trusted Guo Kai's slander and executed Li Mu, replacing him with Yan Ju. As a result, Zhao's forces were defeated, and the state was annihilated by Qin.  

Now, I hear that Wei Shang serves as the Commandant of Yunzhong. He uses all the military market revenues to support his troops, setting aside personal funds to entertain guests and officers. He sacrifices a bull every five days to honor his soldiers and officials. As a result, the Xiongnu stay far away and do not approach the Yunzhong Pass. When the Xiongnu once attacked, Wei Shang led his cavalry to repel them, killing many. The soldiers are all common people conscripted from farming families, who know nothing of military records or identity tags. They fight hard all day, cutting off heads and capturing prisoners, but their achievements are not recognized by their superiors. Clerks apply the law rigidly. Rewards are not given, yet officials enforce the law without fail. I am ignorant, but I believe Your Majesty's laws are too harsh, rewards too light, and punishments too severe. Wei Shang, as the Commandant of Yunzhong, was demoted for a single count of missing the quota of Xiongnu heads by six ranks. Your Majesty punished him by stripping his title and assigning him to hard labor. From this, it is clear that even if you obtained Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them. I am truly ignorant and have offended the imperial taboo. I deserve death, death!"  

Emperor Wen was pleased. That day, he ordered Feng Tang to carry the imperial pardon to Wei Shang, restoring him as the Commandant of Yunzhong, and appointed Feng Tang as the Commandant of Cavalry, overseeing the Central Guards and the cavalry of the commanderies.  

In the seventh year of Emperor Jing's reign, Feng Tang was appointed as the Prime Minister of Chu but was later exempted. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne, he sought virtuous and talented individuals and recommended Feng Tang. Though Feng Tang was over ninety years old and could no longer serve, his son, Feng Sui, courtesy name Wangsun, was appointed as a Knight. Feng Sui was also an extraordinary man and a close friend of mine.  

**Historian's Commentary:**  
Zhang Ji's words reflected the principles of a virtuous official who upheld the law without flattery. Feng Tang's discussions on military strategy were profound and thought-provoking. As the saying goes, "Judge a man by his friends." The qualities praised by these two men could be honored in the halls of power. The Book of Documents says, "Without bias or partisanship, the king's way is vast and clear; without partisanship or bias, the king's way is smooth and accessible." Zhang Ji and Feng Tang embodied this ideal.
