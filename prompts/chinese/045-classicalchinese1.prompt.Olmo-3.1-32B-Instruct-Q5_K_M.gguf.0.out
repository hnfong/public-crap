**Q2: What kind of women were usually the victims? (2 points)**

**Q3: Who benefited from the old practice? (2 points)**  
The River Lord, the sorceress (巫祝), and the local officials (三老、廷掾) benefited from the practice.

**Q4: Did the protagonist use wits or force? Explain (5 points)**  
The protagonist used both wits and symbolic force. He cleverly exposed the corruption by publicly shaming the officials and the sorceress, using a staged selection process to trick them into revealing their greed and cruelty. He then physically threw them into the river as a form of punishment, but the main strategy was psychological—using public spectacle and irony to expose and deter future abuses.

**Q5: Was it moral for the protagonist to do so? Briefly provide views from various perspectives (10 points)**

- **Supportive view:**  
  It was moral because Bo acted to protect the innocent and stop exploitation and oppression of the people. His actions restored justice and improved the lives of the citizens, making him a hero in the eyes of the common folk.

- **Critical view:**  
  Some might argue that throwing people into the river was excessive and possibly lethal, which could be seen as extrajudicial or cruel. However, in the context of the time, such public punishment was sometimes used as a deterrent and a way to restore order.

- **Legal/Modern perspective:**  
  By modern standards, his methods would be considered illegal and unjust. Due process and rule of law were not followed.

- **Moral/Utilitarian perspective:**  
  The ends (protecting the people and ending corruption) may justify the means in a corrupt and lawless environment, but it sets a dangerous precedent for vigilante justice.

- **Cultural perspective:**  
  In traditional Chinese narratives, such acts by a wise and righteous official are often celebrated as necessary for social order and the welfare of the people.

**Q6: Explain the comment and whether it is fair (15 points)**

The comment compares three famous officials:  
- Zi Chan (子產) of Zheng, who made people unable to deceive him,  
- Zi Ji (子賤) of Danfu, who made people unwilling to deceive him,  
- West Men Bo (西門豹) of Ye, who made people dare not deceive him.

It asks who among the three was the most talented and suggests that a good judge of governance can distinguish between them.

**Explanation:**  
The comment highlights three different approaches to governance:  
- Zi Chan made the people honest out of fear of punishment or detection.  
- Zi Ji made the people unwilling to deceive because of his benevolence or moral authority.  
- West Men Bo made the people dare not deceive through a combination of exposing corruption and using public shame as a deterrent.

**Is the comment fair?**  
Yes, the comment is fair in recognizing that each official had a distinct style and achieved similar results through different means.  
- Zi Chan relied on strict governance and detection.  
- Zi Ji relied on virtue and moral influence.  
- West Men Bo relied on wit, public exposure, and symbolic punishment.

The comment does not declare one as absolutely superior but invites readers to consider the nuances of governance. It acknowledges that effective rulers can use different strategies suited to their context and personality. West Men Bo’s method was dramatic and memorable, but Zi Ji’s approach was gentler and perhaps more idealistic, while Zi Chan’s was more about enforcement.

Thus, the comment is balanced and encourages thoughtful evaluation rather than a simple ranking, which is fair given the complexity of governance. [end of text]
