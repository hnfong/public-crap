To evaluate the failure of the Gungshin War, it is necessary to use an academic approach and consider various historical perspectives. This includes examining the political, social, and economic factors that contributed to the conflict's outcome.

Political Factors:
1. Internal power struggles within the Gungshin kingdom: The Gungshin kingdom was plagued by internal strife, as different factions competed for power. The inability of the ruling class to resolve these conflicts weakened their leadership and decision-making capabilities.
2. Weak leadership from the Gungshin king: The king, while initially an able commander, was unable to maintain the momentum of the Gungshin army after his death. This left the kingdom vulnerable to outside threats.
3. Diplomatic failures: The Gungshin kingdom was unable to form strong alliances or negotiate with neighboring kingdoms, which left them isolated and unable to mount a successful defense against the invading forces.

Social Factors:
1. Economic challenges: The Gungshin kingdom was facing economic difficulties, which weakened their ability to maintain a strong military force. This made it easier for the invading forces to penetrate the kingdom's defenses.
2. Cultural and societal divisions: The Gungshin kingdom was divided along ethnic and cultural lines, which made it difficult to unite under a common cause. This division weakened the kingdom's ability to mount a cohesive defense.
3. Lack of public support: The people of the Gungshin kingdom were not fully committed to the cause of their rulers, which made it difficult to sustain a long-term war effort.

Economic Factors:
1. Insufficient resources: The Gungshin kingdom lacked the resources necessary to maintain a strong military force. This made it difficult for them to mount a successful defense against the invading forces.
2. Inefficient distribution of resources: The Gungshin kingdom's resources were not distributed efficiently, which led to a shortage of supplies for the military. This made it difficult for the Gungshin army to sustain their efforts in battle.
3. Economic disruption: The Gungshin kingdom was disrupted by the conflict, as resources were diverted to support the war effort. This further weakened the kingdom's economy and military capabilities.

In conclusion, the failure of the Gungshin War can be attributed to a combination of political, social, and economic factors. These factors weakened the kingdom's leadership, decision-making capabilities, and military strength, making it vulnerable to the invading forces. The Gungshin kingdom's inability to form strong alliances, resolve internal power struggles, and maintain public support further contributed to their downfall.
