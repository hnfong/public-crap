The user wants me to answer a series of questions about a text from "滑稽列传" (The Biographies of the Jesters/Wits) which is actually from the "史记" (Records of the Grand Historian) by Sima Qian. The text is about西门豹 (Ximen Bao) and his governance of Ye (邺).

Let me break down the text first:
- During Duke Wen of Wei's time, Ximen Bao was the magistrate of Ye.
- He asked elders about the people's suffering. They said they suffered from the "He Bo (River God) takes a wife" practice, which made them poor.
- The practice: The Three Elders, court officials, and witches collected millions from the people, used 200-300k for the ceremony, and split the rest.
- The witch would select a pretty girl from a poor family, say she should be He Bo's wife, then prepare her with baths, new clothes, fasting, and a special pavilion by the river.
- After 10+ days of festivities, they'd put her on a bed-like raft and float her down the river. It would float for dozens of miles before sinking.
- Families with pretty girls would flee, making the city empty and poor. This had been going on for a long time.
- The people believed that if they didn't do this, the river would flood.
- Ximen Bao said he wanted to attend the next ceremony.
- At the ceremony, there were 2-3,000 spectators. The witch was an old woman of 70 with 10 female disciples.
- Ximen Bao examined the girl and said she wasn't pretty enough. He asked the old witch to report to He Bo to find a better one, then had his officers throw the witch into the river.
- After a while, he said she was taking too long and threw in three disciples one by one.
- Then he said the disciples were women and couldn't report properly, so he threw the Three Elders in.
- He stood waiting respectfully by the river.
- The officials and elders were terrified.
- He asked if he should send the court officials and elders in too. They kowtowed until their heads bled.
- He let them go. After this, no one dared mention the practice again.
- Ximen Bao then had the people dig 12 canals to irrigate the fields.
- At first the people disliked the labor, but he said: "People can enjoy the results but can't be bothered with the planning. Though you suffer now, your descendants will thank me."
- The canals crossed the imperial highway. When Han dynasty came, officials wanted to combine them, but the people refused, saying Ximen Bao's methods couldn't be changed. The officials gave up.
- Ximen Bao's fame spread, his legacy lasted forever. He was truly a worthy official.

Now let me answer each question:

**Q1: Give a short summary of the story (5 points)**
I need to be concise. The story is about Ximen Bao eliminating the harmful "River God takes a wife" superstition in Ye by throwing the witch and her accomplices into the river, then implementing irrigation projects that benefited the people.

**Q2: What kind of women were usually the victims in the story (2 points)**
The victims were "小家女好者" - pretty girls from poor/ordinary families. The text specifically says "小家女好者" (pretty girls from small/poor families).

**Q3. Who were deemed to benefit from the old practice of offering girls? (2 points)**
The beneficiaries were the Three Elders (三老), the court officials (廷掾), and the witch (祝巫). The text says: "邺三老、廷掾常岁赋敛百姓，收取其钱得数百万，用其二三十万为河伯娶妇，与祝巫共分其余钱持归" - The Three Elders and court officials collected money, used a small portion for the ceremony, and split the rest with the witch.

**Q4: Did the protagonist use wits or force to deal with the situation? Explain (5 points)**
He used both, but primarily wits. He used the superstition itself against the perpetrators - by pretending to believe in it and using its logic to justify throwing them in. The force was the physical act of throwing them, but it was clever because he used their own beliefs/claims against them. He didn't just arrest them; he made it seem like part of the ritual. This was psychological warfare that dismantled the superstition by exposing its hypocrisy.

**Q5: Was it moral for the protagonist to do so? Briefly provide views from various perspectives (10 points)**
This requires multiple perspectives:
- Utilitarian perspective:
