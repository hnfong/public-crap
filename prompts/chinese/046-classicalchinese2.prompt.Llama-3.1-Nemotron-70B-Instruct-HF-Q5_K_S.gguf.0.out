This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

Here are the requested analyses of the passage from 荀子 (Xunzi):

**(1) English Translation**

Wu Hou (魏武侯), the Marquis of Wei, was planning a matter and succeeded in making the right decision, leaving all his ministers unable to match his wisdom. After the court session, he had a pleased expression. Wu Qi (吳起) stepped forward and asked, "Has Your Lordship ever heard of a saying from Zhuang Wang (楚莊王), the King of Chu, which was shared with those around him?"

Wu Hou replied, "What was King Zhuang of Chu's saying?"

Wu Qi responded, "King Zhuang of Chu once planned a matter and succeeded, with none of his ministers able to match him. After the court session, he had a worried expression. Shen Gong Wuzi (申公巫臣) approached and asked, 'Why do you look worried after court, Your Majesty?' The King said, 'I planned a matter and succeeded, yet none of my ministers could match me. This is why I'm worried.' There's a saying from the Zhongzi (中蘬) that goes: 'Among the feudal lords, those who find a worthy teacher will become kings; those who find a worthy friend will become hegemons; those who find themselves doubted will survive; but those who rely solely on their own counsel, with none to match them, will perish.' Now, with my own lack of worth, yet none of my ministers can match me, our state is nearly doomed! This is why I'm worried.' King Zhuang of Chu worried, whereas you, my lord, are pleased."

Wu Hou, chastened, bowed twice and said, "Heaven has sent you, sir, to correct my shortcomings."

**(2) Moral of the Story**

The moral of the story highlights the importance of **surrounding oneself with capable advisors and being aware of one's own limitations**. A leader who has no one to match their wisdom or provide alternative perspectives is in a precarious position, as it indicates either a lack of talented advisors or the leader's inability to foster an environment where others feel encouraged to contribute. This situation can lead to poor decision-making and ultimately, the downfall of the state. The story promotes humility in leadership and the value of diverse, skilled counsel.

**(3) Counterpart in Western (European) Thought**

While the specific anecdote may not have a direct Western counterpart, the underlying concepts resonate with various Western philosophical and leadership thoughts:

* **The importance of diverse counsel**: This is echoed in the ancient Greek concept of the "Council of Elders" and the Roman "Senate," where collective wisdom was valued for decision-making.
* **Awareness of one's limitations (Humility in Leadership)**: This is a theme found in various Western philosophical traditions, including:
	+ **Aristotle's "Phronesis"** (practical wisdom), which emphasizes the importance of experience and the input of others in making virtuous decisions.
	+ **Plato's Philosopher-King**, who, despite being wise, is encouraged to listen to and consider the views of others to ensure just rule.
	+ **Christian humility**, where leaders are often advised to recognize their limitations and seek divine or communal guidance.
* **The danger of unchecked power/intelligence without oversight**: This is a common theme in Western political philosophy, seen in:
	+ **The concept of Checks and Balances** in modern democratic theory, designed to prevent any one branch of government from becoming too powerful.
	+ **Warnings against Tyranny** in the works of philosophers like Plato, Aristotle, and later, the Enlightenment thinkers, who all emphasized the dangers of unchecked power, regardless of the ruler's intelligence. [end of text]
