Got it, let's tackle this translation. First, I need to remember the user's instructions: no transliterating proper names, use original Chinese for them, be literal if in doubt, and just give the translated text without explanation.

Starting with the title: 《張釋之馮唐列傳》 should be "Biographies of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang" since "列傳" is "biographies" and we keep the proper names as Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang.

Next, "張廷尉釋之者，堵陽人也，字季。" Zhang Tingwei Shizhi was a native of Zhuoyang, with the courtesy name Ji. "廷尉" is "Chief Justice" so "Zhang Tingwei" (keeping the title as is since it's a proper name title?). Wait, the user said "proper names (of people, emperors, places)" so "Tingwei" is Zhang's official title, maybe keep it as "Zhang Tingwei" since it's part of his name in context. "堵陽" is Zhuoyang (place, keep as Zhuoyang). "字季" is "courtesy name Ji".

"有兄仲同居。" He lived with his elder brother Zhang Zhong. Wait, "兄仲" is "elder brother Zhong", so "He had an elder brother named Zhong with whom he lived."

"以訾為騎郎，事孝文帝，十歲不得調，無所知名。" "以訾" is "by virtue of his wealth" (since "訾" is wealth), "騎郎" is "Cavalry郎" (郎 is a junior official), so "He became a Cavalry Lang by virtue of his family wealth, serving Emperor Xiaowen, but for ten years he was not promoted and remained unknown."

"釋之曰：「久宦減仲之產，不遂。」欲自免歸。" Shizhi said, "Long-term official service has diminished my brother's property; it's not going well." He wanted to resign and return home.

"Minglangjiang Yuan Ang knew his worth and was sorry to see him leave, so he requested that Shizhi be transferred to fill the position of Yashi." Wait, "中郎將袁盎" is "Middle Colonel Yuan Ang" (keep Yuan Ang), "知其賢" is "knew his virtue", "惜其去" is "pitied his departure", "乃請徙釋之補謁者" is "so he requested to transfer Shizhi to fill the position of Yashi" (謁者 is Yashi, a messenger/official).

"釋之既朝畢，因前言便宜事。" After Shizhi finished the court session, he took the opportunity to speak about expedient matters.

"文帝曰：「卑之，毋甚高論，令今可施行也。」" Emperor Wen said, "Be more practical; don't engage in overly lofty discussions. Make sure what you say can be implemented today."

"於是釋之言秦漢之閒事，秦所以失而漢所以興者久之。" So Shizhi spoke at length about affairs between Qin and Han, explaining why Qin lost the throne and why Han emerged victorious.

"文帝稱善，乃拜釋之為謁者仆射。" Emperor Wen praised him, and then appointed Shizhi as Yashi Pushe (Chief Yashi).

Next section: "釋之從行，登虎圈。" Shizhi accompanied the emperor on a trip and climbed up to the tiger enclosure.

"上問上林尉諸禽獸簿，十餘問，尉左右視，盡不能對。" The emperor asked the Shanglin尉 (Shanglin Officer) about the register of various beasts and birds; after more than ten questions, the officer looked around left and right and could not answer any.

"虎圈嗇夫從旁代尉對上所問禽獸簿甚悉，欲以觀其能口對響應無窮者。" The tiger enclosure啬夫 (啬夫 is a minor official) stepped forward from the side to answer all the emperor's questions about the beast register in great detail, wanting to show off his ability to respond fluently without end.

"文帝曰：「吏不當若是邪？尉無賴！」乃詔釋之拜嗇夫為上林令。" Emperor Wen said, "Isn't this how an official should be? The officer is useless!" He then ordered Shizhi to appoint the啬夫 as Shanglin Prefect.

"釋之久之前曰：「陛下以絳侯周勃何如人也？」" Shizhi stood forward after a long while and said, "Your Majesty, how would you describe Marquis Jiang Zhou Bo?"

"上曰：「長者也。」" The emperor said, "A worthy man."

"又復問：「東陽侯張相如何如人也？」上復曰：「長者。」" He asked again, "How would you describe Marquis Dongyang Zhang Xiang?" The emperor again said, "A worthy man."

"釋之曰：「夫絳侯、東陽侯稱為長者，此兩人言事曾不能出口，豈斅此嗇夫諜諜利口捷給哉！」" Shizhi said, "Marquis Jiang and Marquis Dongyang are called worthy men, yet these two could barely speak when discussing matters—how could they imitate this啬夫 who chattters away with a sharp tongue and quick responses!"

"且秦以任刀筆之吏，吏爭以亟疾苛察相高，然其敝徒文具耳，無惻隱之實。" Moreover, Qin relied on literate officials (knife-and-ink scribes), and officials competed by being quick, harsh, and meticulous, but the flaw was that they only focused on formalities, without genuine compassion.

"以故不聞其過，陵遲而至於二世，天下土崩。" Because of this, they did not hear about their own faults, declined gradually until the second generation, and the world collapsed.

"今陛下以嗇夫口辯而超遷之，臣恐天下隨風靡靡，爭為口辯而無其實。" Now Your Majesty is promoting this啬夫 because of his eloquence— I fear the world will follow this trend, competing in empty talk without substance.

"且下之化上疾於景響，舉錯不可不審也。」" Moreover, the way subordinates are influenced by their superiors is faster than shadows and echoes—one's actions must not be careless."

"文帝曰：「善。」乃止不拜嗇夫。" Emperor Wen said, "Good." He then stopped and did not appoint the啬夫.

Continuing: "上就車，召釋之參乘，徐行，問釋之秦之敝。" The emperor got into the carriage, summoned Shizhi to ride alongside him, drove slowly, and asked Shizhi about Qin's flaws.

"具以質言。" Shizhi spoke frankly and comprehensively.

"至宮，上拜釋之為公車令。" When they reached the palace, the emperor appointed Shizhi as Gongche Prefect (official in charge of the imperial carriage and petitions).

"頃之，太子與梁王共車入朝，不下司馬門，於是釋之追止太子、梁王無得入殿門。" Soon afterward, the Crown Prince and Prince Liang traveled together in a carriage to court and did not alight at the司马 Gate. Shizhi chased after them, stopping them from entering the palace gate.

"遂劾不下公門不敬，奏之。" He then accused them of disrespect for not alighting at the official gate and submitted the charge.

"薄太后聞之，文帝免冠謝曰：「教兒子不謹。」" Empress Dowager Bo heard about it; Emperor Wen removed his hat and apologized, saying, "I have not taught my sons carefully."

"薄太后乃使使承詔赦太子、梁王，然後得入。" Empress Dowager Bo then sent an envoy to convey the imperial pardon for the Crown Prince and Prince Liang, after which they were allowed to enter.

"文帝由是奇釋之，拜為中大夫。" Emperor Wen therefore valued Shizhi for his integrity and appointed him as Zhong Dafu (a high-ranking literary official).

"頃之，至中郎將。" Soon afterward, he became Middle Colonel.

"從行至霸陵，居北臨廁。" He accompanied the emperor to Baling, where they stood on the northern slope overlooking the surroundings.

"是時慎夫人從，上指示慎夫人新豐道，曰：「此走邯鄲道也。」" At that time, Lady Shen was accompanying them; the emperor pointed to the Xinfeng road for Lady Shen and said, "This is the road leading to Handan."

"使慎夫人鼓瑟，上自倚瑟而歌，意慘悽悲懷，顧謂群臣曰：「嗟乎！以北山石為槨，用紵絮斮陳，蕠漆其閒，豈可動哉！」" He asked Lady Shen to play the se, and the emperor himself accompanied her on the se while singing, his mood sad and melancholy. He looked around at his ministers and said, "Alas! If we use northern mountain stones for the outer coffin, line it with chopped ramie fluff, and coat it with pitch—how could it be shaken!"

"左右皆曰：「善。」" The attendants all said, "Good."

"釋之前進曰：「使其中有可欲者，雖錮南山猶有郄；使其中無可欲者，雖無石槨，又何戚焉！」" Shizhi stepped forward and said, "If there is something desirable inside, even if you seal Mount Nanshan around it, there will still be gaps; if there is nothing desirable inside, even without a stone coffin, what need is there for sorrow!"

"文帝稱善。其後拜釋之為廷尉。" Emperor Wen praised him. Later, he appointed Shizhi as Tingwei (Chief Justice).

Next incident: "頃之，上行出中渭橋，有一人從橋下走出，乘輿馬驚。" Soon afterward, the emperor was traveling out of the Zhongwei Bridge when a man suddenly ran out from under the bridge, startling the emperor's horse.

"於是使騎捕，屬之廷尉。" The emperor sent cavalry to arrest him and handed him over to the Tingwei.

"釋之治問。曰：「縣人來，聞蹕，匿橋下。久之，以為行已過，即出，見乘輿車騎，即走耳。」" Shizhi interrogated him. The man said, "I am a local from the county; I heard the imperial procession coming, so I hid under the bridge. After a long time, I thought the procession had passed, so I came out. When I saw the imperial carriage and cavalry, I ran out of fear."

"廷尉秦當，一人犯蹕，當罰金。" The Tingwei judged the case: for a person violating the imperial procession, the penalty was a fine.

"文帝怒曰：「此人親驚吾馬，吾馬賴柔和，令他馬，固不敗傷我乎？而廷尉乃當之罰金！」" Emperor Wen was angry and said, "This man directly startled my horse! Fortunately, my horse is gentle; if it were another horse, wouldn't it have injured me? Yet the Tingwei only sentences him to a fine!"

"釋之曰：「法者天子所與天下公共也。今法如此而更重之，是法不信於民也。」" Shizhi said, "The law is something the Son of Heaven shares with the whole world. If the law states this penalty but we impose a heavier one, the law will lose credibility with the people."

"且方其時，上使立誅之則已。今既下廷尉，廷尉，天下之平也，一傾而天下用法皆為輕重，民安所措其手足？唯陛下察之。」" Moreover, at that time, if the emperor had ordered him executed immediately, that would have been fine. Now that the case has been handed over to the Tingwei, the Tingwei is the balance of the world—if this balance is tilted, then the entire world will apply the law arbitrarily, and how will the people know where to place their hands and feet? I beg Your Majesty to consider this."

"良久，上曰：「廷尉當是也。」" After a long while, the emperor said, "The Tingwei's judgment is correct."

Next: "其後有人盜高廟坐前玉環，捕得，文帝怒，下廷尉治。" Later, someone stole a jade ring from the seat before Gao Temple; when the thief was caught, Emperor Wen was furious and handed the case over to the Tingwei.

"釋之案律盜宗廟服御物者為奏，奏當棄市。" Shizhi investigated according to the law regarding those who steal imperial temple utensils and submitted a report, recommending that the thief be executed by public display.

"上大怒曰：「人之無道，乃盜先帝廟器，吾屬廷尉者，欲致之族，而君以法奏之，非吾所以共承宗廟意也。」" The emperor was extremely angry and said, "How unethical this person is—to steal the ancestors' temple vessels! I handed this case to the Tingwei because I wanted his entire family executed, but you are only reporting according to the law—this is not in line with my intention to respectfully uphold the宗庙!"

"釋之免冠頓首謝曰：「法如是足也。且罪等，然以逆順為差。」" Shizhi removed his hat, kowtowed, and apologized, saying, "The law is sufficient as it is. Moreover, crimes are graded, but they should be distinguished by their degree of rebellion."

"今盜宗廟器而族之，有如萬分之一，假令愚民取長陵一抔土，陛下何以加其法乎？」" If stealing temple vessels leads to family execution, then suppose a foolish commoner takes a handful of soil from Changling—how will Your Majesty impose the law on him?"

"久之，文帝與太后言之，乃許廷尉當。" After a long time, Emperor Wen discussed it with the empress dowager and agreed to the Tingwei's judgment.

"是時，中尉條侯周亞夫與梁相山都侯王恬開見釋之持議平，乃結為親友。" At that time, Lieutenant Zhou Yafu, Marquis of Tao, and Wang Tiankai, Marquis of Shandu and Prime Minister of Liang, saw that Shizhi handled cases fairly and thus became close friends with him.

"張廷尉由此天下稱之。" Zhang Tingwei was therefore praised across the world.

"後文帝崩，景帝立，釋之恐，稱病。" After Emperor Wen died, Emperor Jing ascended the throne; Shizhi was afraid and pretended to be ill.

"欲免去，懼大誅至；欲見謝，則未知何如。" He wanted to resign, but feared severe punishment; he wanted to meet and apologize, but did not know how.

"用王生計，卒見謝，景帝不過也。" He followed Wang Sheng's plan, finally meeting to apologize, and Emperor Jing did not blame him.

"王生者，善為黃老言，處士也。" Wang Sheng was a recluse skilled in黄老学说 (Huang-Lao thought).

"嘗召居廷中，三公九卿盡會立，王生老人，曰「吾韤解」，顧謂張廷尉：「為我結韤！」" Once, he was summoned to the court; all the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers were standing there. The elderly Wang Sheng said, "My shoe strap is loose," and turned to Zhang Tingwei, saying, "Tie my shoe strap for me!"

"釋之跪而結之。" Shizhi knelt down to tie it.

"既已，人或謂王生曰：「獨柰何廷辱張廷尉，使跪結韤？」" Afterward, someone said to Wang Sheng, "Why did you humiliate Zhang Tingwei in court by making him kneel to tie your shoe strap?"

"王生曰：「吾老且賤，自度終無益於張廷尉。」" Wang Sheng said, "I am old and lowly; I realize I will never be of any help to Zhang Tingwei."

"張廷尉方今天下名臣，吾故聊辱廷尉，使跪結韤，欲以重之。」" Zhang Tingwei is now a famous minister of the state—so I intentionally humiliated him slightly by making him kneel to tie my strap, to enhance his reputation."

"諸公聞之，賢王生而重張廷尉。" The officials heard this and praised Wang Sheng while respecting Zhang Tingwei even more.

"張廷尉事景帝歲餘，為淮南王相，猶尚以前過也。" Zhang Tingwei served Emperor Jing for more than a year and was appointed Prime Minister of Huainan King, still because of a past fault.

"久之，釋之卒。其子曰張摯，字長公，官至大夫，免。" Later, Shizhi died. His son was Zhang Zhi, courtesy name Changgong, who held office as a Dafu but was dismissed.

"以不能取容當世，故終身不仕。" Because he could not adapt to the times, he never served in office again.

Now Feng Tang's section: "馮唐者，其大父趙人。" Feng Tang's grandfather was from Zhao.

"父徙代。漢興徙安陵。" His father moved to Dai; when Han was established, they moved to Anling.

"唐以孝著，為中郎署長，事文帝。" Tang was famous for his filial piety and served as the Chief of the Middle Lang Office, serving Emperor Wen.

"文帝輦過，問唐曰：「父老何自為郎？家安在？」" Emperor Wen passed by in his carriage and asked Tang, "Old sir, why have you become a Lang? Where is your home?"

"唐具以實對。" Tang answered truthfully in detail.

"文帝曰：「吾居代時，吾尚食監高袪數為我言趙將李齊之賢，戰於鉅鹿下。」" Emperor Wen said, "When I was in Dai, my Food Supervisor Gao Qu often told me about the virtue of Zhao general Li Qi, who fought at Julu."

"今吾每飯，意未嘗不在鉅鹿也。父知之乎？」" Now every time I eat, my mind is always at Julu. Do you know about this, sir?"

"唐對曰：「尚不如廉頗、李牧之為將也。」" Tang replied, "Li Qi is still not as good a general as Lian Po or Li Mu."

"上曰：「何以？」" The emperor said, "Why?"

"唐曰：「臣大父在趙時，為官（卒）
