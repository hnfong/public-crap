1. Translation of the story:

The Marquis of Wei, Wen, would deliberate on matters and make the correct decisions, but his ministers could not keep pace with him. After court, he would retire with a look of joy. Wu Qi, a minister, advanced and said, "I have heard a saying of King Zhuang of Chu, have you heard it as well?" The Marquis of Wei asked, "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?" Wu Qi replied, "King Zhuang of Chu would deliberate on matters and make the correct decisions, but his ministers could not keep pace with him. After court, he would retire with a look of worry. Zi Gong, a minister of Chu, asked, 'Why does the king retire from court with a look of worry?' King Zhuang replied, 'I am worried because I alone can make correct decisions and my ministers cannot keep pace with me. This reminds me of the words of the Middle Zilu: "The feudal lords consider themselves wise if they have a teacher, powerful if they have allies, and secure if they are cautious. But if they rely solely on their own wisdom and find no one else to match them, they are doomed." Now, relying on my own inadequate wisdom, my ministers cannot keep pace with me. Is my state not on the verge of ruin? That is why I am worried.' King Zhuang was worried, yet you, my lord, are pleased." Upon hearing this, the Marquis of Wei bowed twice and said, "Heaven has sent you, Master Wu, to correct my shortcomings."

2. Moral of the story:

The moral of the story is that a ruler should not be overly pleased with himself for being the only one capable of making correct decisions. Instead, he should be concerned that his ministers are not able to keep pace with him. A wise ruler understands the importance of having capable and wise advisors who can share the burden of governance. If a ruler is the sole source of wisdom and decision-making, it can be a sign of weakness, as it indicates a lack of talent and support within his administration. This could potentially lead to the downfall of the state. The story emphasizes the value of collective wisdom and the dangers of over-reliance on a single individual's capabilities.

3. Counterparts in Western thought:

The concepts in this story resonate with several ideas in Western political philosophy and leadership theory. One such counterpart is the concept of the "philosopher-king" found in Plato's "Republic," where Plato argues that the ideal ruler should be a philosopher, someone who loves wisdom and is capable of making just decisions for the good of the state. However, Plato also acknowledges the importance of having a group of philosopher-rulers to ensure that the state is governed by collective wisdom rather than a single individual.

Another related concept is the "balance of power" and the idea of "checks and balances" in governance, which suggests that power should not be concentrated in the hands of a single ruler or group but should be distributed among different branches of government to prevent abuse of power and ensure that decisions are made with broader input.

Additionally, the story's emphasis on the importance of advisors and collective decision-making can be compared to the Western notion of a "cabinet" or advisory council, which has its roots in the Roman consilium. The idea is that a ruler or executive should consult with a group of experienced and knowledgeable individuals before making important decisions.

Lastly, the story's warning about the perils of self-reliance and the need for humility in leadership has parallels in various Western leadership theories that stress the importance of humility, openness to advice, and the ability to empower others as key traits of effective leaders.
