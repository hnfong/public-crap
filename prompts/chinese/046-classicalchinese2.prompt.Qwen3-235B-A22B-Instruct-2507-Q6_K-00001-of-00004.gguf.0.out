**(1) English Translation:**

When Marquis Wu of Wei made decisions that were consistently sound and none of his ministers could match his insight, he withdrew from court with a look of satisfaction. Wu Qi stepped forward and said: "Has Your Highness ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu, which he once shared with those around him?"  
Marquis Wu asked: "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?"  
Wu Qi replied: "King Zhuang of Chu also made sound decisions, and none of his ministers could match him. Yet when he left court, he wore a look of worry. Shen Gong Wuchen noticed this and asked: 'Your Majesty, why do you appear so troubled after court?' King Zhuang replied: 'I make sound decisions, and none of my ministers can match me—this is precisely why I am worried. There is a saying from the Zhong Kui: "A ruler who finds ministers wise enough to be his teachers will become a king; one who finds ministers he can treat as equals will become a hegemon; one who accepts ministers who can challenge or question him will survive; but one who believes he is superior to everyone around him and needs no counsel—such a ruler will perish." Now, though I am unworthy, none of my ministers can match me. Is my state not on the brink of ruin? This is why I am worried.' King Zhuang felt anxiety where you, sir, feel joy."

Marquis Wu stepped back hesitantly, bowed twice, and said: "Heaven has sent you, sir, to awaken me to my fault."

**(2) Moral of the Story:**

The moral of this story is that **true wisdom and effective leadership lie not in personal superiority, but in humility, self-awareness, and the ability to accept counsel and criticism from others.** A ruler who rejoices in being unmatched by his ministers is in danger of becoming isolated, overconfident, and blind to his own flaws—ultimately leading to downfall. In contrast, a wise ruler, like King Zhuang of Chu, feels concern when no one can challenge or advise him, recognizing that the absence of capable advisors or honest feedback is a sign of impending failure.

The story emphasizes the Confucian ideal of the ruler as a learner and moral exemplar who surrounds himself with virtuous and capable ministers. It warns against arrogance and celebrates intellectual and moral humility. The hierarchy of leadership outcomes—"teachers" lead to kingship, "equals" to hegemony, "challengers" to survival, and "none like me" to ruin—highlights the importance of relational dynamics in governance.

**(3) Counterparts in Western (European) Thought:**

Yes, the core ideas in this story have strong parallels in Western philosophical and political thought:

- **Socratic Humility:** Socrates famously claimed, "I know that I know nothing," and portrayed himself as a "gadfly" who challenged the false wisdom of others. His method of dialectic questioning mirrors the idea of seeking "those who challenge or question" the ruler. Like King Zhuang, Socrates valued self-awareness and the recognition of one’s own ignorance as the beginning of wisdom.

- **Plato’s Philosopher-King:** In *The Republic*, Plato argues that only those who are truly wise and self-reflective should rule. He also emphasizes the need for rulers to be educated by wiser mentors—akin to the "ruler who finds teachers" in the story. The idea that unchecked power without wisdom leads to ruin is central to Plato’s critique of tyranny.

- **Aristotle’s Political Theory:** In *Politics*, Aristotle warns against the dangers of autocratic rule and stresses the value of collective deliberation. He argues that even a wise individual benefits from counsel and that the "many" can, in some ways, be wiser than the few. This resonates with the idea that a ruler should welcome advisors who can challenge him.

- **Medieval and Renaissance Political Thought:** Thinkers like Thomas Aquinas and later Erasmus emphasized the *rex justus* (just king), who listens to wise counselors and governs with humility. Erasmus’ *The Education of a Christian Prince* (1516) directly advises rulers to welcome criticism and avoid flattery—echoing Wu Qi’s rebuke.

- **Enlightenment Critiques of Absolutism:** Montesquieu and Rousseau warned against the concentration of power and the dangers of rulers who believe themselves infallible. The French Revolution, in part, was a reaction to the arrogance of monarchy—paralleling the "self-as-mind-surpassing-all" path to ruin.

In sum, while the cultural expressions differ, **the core ethical and political insight—that humility, self-criticism, and openness to challenge are essential for good leadership—is deeply shared between classical Chinese thought and Western philosophy.** [end of text]
