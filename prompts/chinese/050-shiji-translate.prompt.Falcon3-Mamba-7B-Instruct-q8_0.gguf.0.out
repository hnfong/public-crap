The **Fang** and **Tang** families were from Zhangling. Zhang Tang had a brother named Shang. They were both officials in the Imperial Secretariat. When Emperor Ming was ten years old, Tang was not able to secure a position, so he did not attain any significant office. Fang Shang knew of Tang's talent and wished to leave the capital. However, Yuan, the Chief Minister, refused to allow him to go. Tang, seeing that his efforts were in vain, decided to resign and become a **fangping** (a lower-level official).

Emperor Ming, upon hearing of Tang's talent, wanted to keep him. He said, "I do not wish to reduce Tang's position too much. Let us make him a **fangping** so that he can serve the current emperor." Tang said, "In the times of Emperor Zhao, he failed to appoint Li Yue, and in the times of Emperor Ming, he failed to appoint Fan Ye. Now, if I were to be appointed as a **fangping**, I would not be able to fulfill my duties. It is better to be a **fangping** with no significant achievements than to be appointed and fail." Thus, Emperor Ming appointed Tang as a **fangping**.

During Emperor Ming's reign, he summoned Fang Shang to the carriage inspection. Shang rode slowly, and the emperor asked him several questions. The attendants and officials looked on, unable to answer. Fang Shang answered all the questions without hesitation. Emperor Ming was pleased and said, "This man is not as knowledgeable as Li Yue or Fan Ye, but he is still capable." He then appointed Fang Shang as a carriage attendant.

Fang Shang, while traveling in a carriage, asked the attendant about the **Yuan** family. The attendant said, "They are from Yuan County." He asked again, "How many times have they been dismissed from office?" The attendant replied, "They have been dismissed twice." Fang Shang said, "This is not good! The officials of Yuan County are too knowledgeable, and they have been dismissed twice. How can this be?" The emperor then appointed Fang Shang as a **fangping** to investigate the matter.

During Emperor Ming's reign, Tang was appointed as a **fangping** and was later promoted to **zhuanyuan** (a high-ranking official). Once, the emperor stopped at a place called Zhangling Mountain and asked Tang, "How old is Yuan?" Tang replied, "He is over seventy." The emperor then asked, "What kind of person is he?" Tang said, "He is old and frail." The emperor said, "I wish to see him." Tang said, "The officials of the Imperial Secretariat are not supposed to know about the emperor's personal affairs. If the emperor wishes to see him, he should send someone else." The emperor then summoned Fang Shang and said, "You are a wise man. Please tell me about Yuan." Fang Shang said, "The emperor is old, and his hair is white. He is worried about the people and the land. He has not slept well for a long time. He is kind and generous, and he values the loyalty of his officials. He is not like Yuan, who is cunning and deceitful." The emperor said, "I understand." He then appointed Fang Shang as a **fangping**.

Later, when Emperor Ming was ill, he summoned Fang Shang and said, "The empire is in turmoil, and the Hu people have rebelled. How can we deal with this?" Fang Shang said, "In ancient times, the Qin and Han dynasties both rose and fell. The reason for their rise and fall was the use of sharp and blunt instruments. The Qin dynasty used sharp instruments to oppress the people, causing them to suffer and lose their land. The Han dynasty used blunt instruments, allowing the people to live in peace.
