The Biographies of Zhang Shi-zi and Feng Tang

Zhang Shi-zi, the Magistrate of the Imperial Court, was from Duyang, with the courtesy name Ji. He lived with his elder brother Zhong. He served as a cavalryman due to his wealth, and served Emperor Wen for ten years without promotion, remaining unknown. Zhang Shi-zi said, "Long service has diminished Brother Zhong's property, and I have not succeeded." He wanted to resign and return home. Middle Commander Yuan Ang knew his virtue and regretted his departure, so he requested that Zhang Shi-zi be transferred to serve as an imperial attendant. After Zhang Shi-zi had finished his morning court duties, he approached and spoke about matters of convenience. Emperor Wen said, "Lower your tone, do not speak too highly, so that what you say can be implemented now." Then Zhang Shi-zi spoke about events between the Qin and Han dynasties, and the reasons why the Qin lost and the Han gained, for a long time. Emperor Wen praised him, and appointed Zhang Shi-zi as the chief of the imperial attendants.

Zhang Shi-zi accompanied the emperor on a tour, climbing the tiger enclosure. The emperor asked the official in charge of the imperial park about the records of various animals, asking more than ten questions. The official looked left and right, unable to answer. The tiger keeper, standing beside the official, answered the emperor's questions about the animal records in great detail, wanting to show his ability to respond quickly and endlessly. Emperor Wen said, "Should officials not be like this? This official is worthless!" He then ordered Zhang Shi-zi to appoint the keeper as the head of the imperial park. Zhang Shi-zi hesitated for a long time before saying, "Your Majesty, what kind of person is Marquis of Jiang, Zhou Bo?" The emperor said, "He is a virtuous elder." Zhang Shi-zi asked again, "What kind of person is Marquis of Dongyang, Zhang Xiang?" The emperor replied, "He is also a virtuous elder." Zhang Shi-zi said, "Marquis of Jiang and Marquis of Dongyang are called virtuous elders, yet these two cannot even speak their minds. How could they emulate this keeper's quick-witted and eloquent manner? Moreover, the Qin dynasty relied on clerks, and officials competed to be swift, harsh, and meticulous, but their downfall was merely a matter of formality, lacking genuine compassion. Therefore, they did not hear of their faults, and their decline led to the second emperor, when the whole world collapsed. Now, Your Majesty promotes this keeper because of his eloquence, and I fear that the whole world will follow this trend, competing for eloquence without substance. Furthermore, the people's transformation by the ruler is faster than shadows and echoes, so decisions must not be made hastily." Emperor Wen said, "Well said." He then stopped and did not appoint the keeper.

The emperor got into his carriage, summoned Zhang Shi-zi to ride with him, and slowly asked him about the decline of the Qin dynasty. Zhang Shi-zi answered truthfully. Upon reaching the palace, the emperor appointed Zhang Shi-zi as the chief of the imperial carriage.

Soon after, the crown prince and the King of Liang entered the court together in a carriage, not dismounting at the Sima Gate. Zhang Shi-zi chased after them and stopped the crown prince and King of Liang from entering the palace gate. He then impeached them for disrespect for not dismounting at the public gate and submitted the case. Empress Dowager Bo heard about it, and Emperor Wen removed his hat and apologized, saying, "I did not teach my son properly." Empress Dowager Bo then sent an envoy to pardon the crown prince and King of Liang, and they were allowed to enter. Emperor Wen thus considered Zhang Shi-zi extraordinary, and appointed him as a middle counselor.

Soon after, he became a middle commander. He accompanied the emperor to Baling, staying in the northern pavilion. At this time, Lady Shen was also present. The emperor pointed to Shenxin Road and said to Lady Shen, "This is the road to Handan." He asked Lady Shen to play the zither, and he himself leaned on the zither and sang, his mood melancholy and sorrowful. He turned to his ministers and said, "Alas! If we use the stones from Mount Beishan as the coffin, and fill it with hemp and lacquer, how could it be moved?" Those around him all said, "Excellent." Zhang Shi-zi stepped forward and said, "If there is something desirable inside, even if it is sealed with Mount Nan, there will still be gaps; if there is nothing desirable inside, even without a stone coffin, why should we worry?" Emperor Wen praised him. Later, he was appointed as the magistrate of the imperial court.

Soon after, the emperor was traveling and passed over the Middle Wei Bridge when a person came out from under the bridge, causing the imperial carriage horses to be startled. The emperor then ordered cavalry to capture him and hand him over to the magistrate. Zhang Shi-zi interrogated him. The man said, "I came from the county, heard the imperial carriage, and hid under the bridge. After a long time, I thought the imperial carriage had passed, so I came out and saw the imperial carriage and horses, and ran away." The magistrate of Qin sentenced him, stating that one who obstructed the imperial carriage should be fined. Emperor Wen was angry and said, "This person personally startled my horse. My horse was fortunate to be gentle, but if it were another horse, would it not have injured me? Yet the magistrate only sentenced him to a fine!" Zhang Shi-zi said, "Law is what the Son of Heaven shares with the whole world. Now the law is like this, and if we change it, the law will not be trusted by the people. Moreover, at that time, if the emperor had ordered immediate execution, that would have been it. Now that he has been handed over to the magistrate, the magistrate is the balance of the world. If it is tilted, the application of law throughout the world will be inconsistent, and where will the people place their hands and feet? Please consider this, Your Majesty." After a long time, the emperor said, "The magistrate's judgment is correct."

Later, someone stole a jade ring from the front seat of the High Ancestor's temple. They were caught, and Emperor Wen was furious, handing them over to the magistrate for punishment. Zhang Shi-zi examined the law and found that stealing sacrificial objects should be reported, and the sentence was to be executed in the marketplace. The emperor was extremely angry and said, "How can someone be so unrighteous as to steal the High Ancestor's temple objects? I handed them over to the magistrate to punish them with extermination, but you report them according to the law. This is not in line with my intention to jointly honor the ancestral temple." Zhang Shi-zi removed his hat and bowed to apologize, saying, "The law is sufficient as it is. Moreover, the crimes are equal, but the punishment differs based on the order of events. Now, if we exterminate those who steal sacrificial objects from the ancestral temple, what if someone takes a handful of soil from Emperor Gao's tomb? How can you increase their punishment?" After a long time, Emperor Wen discussed it with Empress Dowager, and finally agreed with the magistrate's judgment. At this time, the Middle Commander, Marquis of Tiao, Zhou Yafu, and the Chancellor of Liang, Marquis of Shandu, Wang Tiance, saw that Zhang Shi-zi's opinions were fair, and thus became close friends. Zhang Shi-zi was thus praised throughout the world.

After Emperor Wen died, Emperor Jing ascended the throne. Zhang Shi-zi was afraid, claimed illness, and wanted to resign, fearing severe punishment. He wanted to see the emperor and apologize, but did not know how. Using Wang Sheng's plan, he finally saw the emperor and apologized, and Emperor Jing did not blame him.

Wang Sheng was skilled in the teachings of Huang-Lao and was a recluse. He was once summoned to the imperial court, where all the Three Excellencies and Nine Ministers gathered. Wang Sheng, an old man, said, "My shoe strap is loose," and turned to Zhang Shi-zi and said, "Tie my shoe strap for me!" Zhang Shi-zi knelt and tied it for him. Afterward, someone said to Wang Sheng, "Why did you humiliate Zhang Shi-zi in the court, making him kneel to tie your shoe strap?" Wang Sheng said, "I am old and lowly, and I know that I will never benefit Zhang Shi-zi. Zhang Shi-zi is a famous minister of the world today, so I deliberately humiliated him, making him kneel to tie my shoe strap, to make him more respected." Hearing this, the officials considered Wang Sheng virtuous and Zhang Shi-zi more respected.

Zhang Shi-zi served Emperor Jing for more than a year, then became the chancellor of the King of Huainan, still bearing the previous disgrace. After a long time, Zhang Shi-zi died. His son was named Zhang Zhi, with the courtesy name Changgong, and he served as a doctor, but was later dismissed. Because he could not accommodate himself to the world, he never held office for the rest of his life.

Feng Tang's great-grandfather was from Zhao. His father moved to Dai. After the Han dynasty was established, he moved to Anling. Feng Tang was known for his filial piety and served as the chief of the imperial attendants, serving Emperor Wen. Emperor Wen's carriage passed by, and he asked Feng Tang, "Old man, why are you a court official? Where is your home?" Feng Tang answered truthfully. Emperor Wen said, "When I was in Dai, my imperial food supervisor Gao Qu often told me about the virtue of Zhao general Li Qi, who fought at Julu. Now every time I eat, my thoughts are always at Julu. Do you know about this?" Feng Tang replied, "He is still not as good as generals Lian Po and Li Mu." The emperor asked, "Why?" Feng Tang said, "My great-grandfather served as a captain in Zhao, and was good friends with Li Mu. My father was once the chancellor of Dai, and was good friends with Zhao general Li Qi, so he knew his character." After hearing about Lian Po and Li Mu, Emperor Wen was pleased and slapped his thigh, saying, "Alas! If only I could have Lian Po and Li Mu as my generals, I would not worry about the Xiongnu!" Feng Tang said, "Your Majesty, even if you obtained Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them." The emperor was angry, stood up, and entered the palace. After a long time, he summoned Feng Tang and rebuked him, saying, "Why did you humiliate me in public? Didn't you have a private place to do so?" Feng Tang apologized, saying, "I, a rustic, did not know the taboos."

At that time, the Xiongnu had just invaded Chaona, killing the governor of Beidi, Ying. The emperor was concerned about the Xiongnu invasion, so he finally asked Feng Tang, "How do you know that I cannot use Lian Po and Li Mu?" Feng Tang replied, "I have heard that ancient kings, when sending generals, would kneel and push the wheel, saying that matters within the city gates are decided by me, while matters outside the city gates are decided by the general. Rewards and punishments are all decided outside, and reported back. This is not an empty statement. My great-grandfather said that when Li Mu was the general of Zhao and stationed at the border, he used the taxes from the military market to entertain the soldiers, and rewards and punishments were decided outside, without interference from the center. He was entrusted with responsibility and expected to achieve success, so Li Mu could fully utilize his intelligence and abilities. He dispatched 1,300 chariots, 13,000 archers, and 100,000 elite soldiers, thus chasing the Chanyu northward, defeating the Donghu, destroying the Danlin, suppressing the powerful Qin to the west, and supporting Han and Wei to the south. At that time, Zhao was almost a hegemon. Later, when King Zhao Xian ascended the throne, his mother was a singer. When Zhao Xian became king, he listened to the slander of Guo Kai, and finally executed Li Mu, appointing Yan Ju to replace him. Thus, the army was defeated, and Zhao was conquered by Qin. Now I have heard that Wei Shang, the governor of Yunzhong, uses all the taxes from the military market to entertain the soldiers and officers, and spends his own money to entertain guests, military officers, and servants every five days. Therefore, the Xiongnu stay far away and do not approach the border of Yunzhong. Once the Xiongnu invaded, Wei Shang led the chariots and cavalry to attack them, killing many of their troops. The soldiers are all sons of farmers, rising from the fields to join the army, how could they know the rules of military law? They fight all day long,斩首捕虏，上报功绩，如果有一句话不符合，文吏就会用法律制裁他们。赏赐不能兑现，而官吏必须执行法律。我认为陛下法律太严明，赏赐太轻，惩罚太重。而且云中太守魏尚因为上报的斩首和俘虏数量相差六级而被下狱，削去爵位，判刑。由此看来，即使陛下得到廉颇、李牧，也不能任用他们。我确实愚昧，触犯忌讳，死罪死罪！”文帝很高兴。当天命令冯唐持节赦免魏尚，恢复他的云中太守职位，并任命冯唐为车骑都尉，主管中尉和郡国的车士。

七年，景帝即位，任命冯唐为楚相，后被免职。武帝即位，求贤良，举荐冯唐。冯唐当时已年近百岁，不能再担任官职，于是任命冯唐的儿子冯遂为郎官。冯遂字王孙，也是奇士，与我交好。

太史公曰：张季之言长者，守法不阿意；冯公之论将帅，有味哉！有味哉！语曰“不知其人，视其友”。二君之所称颂，可著廊庙。书曰“不偏不党，王道荡荡；不党不偏，王道便便”。张季、冯公近之矣。 [end of text]
