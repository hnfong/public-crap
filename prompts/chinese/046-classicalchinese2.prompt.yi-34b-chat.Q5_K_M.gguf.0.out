This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

(1) Translation into English (with proper names retained in Chinese):

魏武侯谋划事情成功，大臣们没有人能比得上，退朝后露出高兴的神色。吴起走上前说：“您听说过楚庄王的话吗？”武侯说：“楚庄王的话是怎么说的？”吴起回答说：“楚庄王谋划事情成功，大臣们没有人能比得上，退朝后露出忧愁的神色。申公巫臣进宫询问说：‘大王退朝后为何面带忧色？’庄王说：‘我谋划事情成功，大臣们没有人能比得上，因此我忧愁。其中中蘬说过这样的话，“诸侯中自己能得到良师的人称王，得到朋友的人称霸，得到疑虑的人得以保存，自以为谋划无人能及的人将灭亡。”现在以我的不才，而大臣们没有人能比得上，我们国家岂不是接近灭亡了吗！因此我忧愁。’楚庄王因为忧愁，而您因为高兴。”武侯听了后，再三拜谢说：“上天派先生来纠正我的过失啊。”

(2) Explanation of the moral of the story:

The story illustrates the importance of humility and the value of diverse opinions in decision-making. It teaches that a leader should not be complacent when he or she achieves success, but rather should be concerned about the lack of input from others. The story encourages leaders to seek out different perspectives and to value those who can provide constructive criticism. It also suggests that overconfidence and the inability to learn from others can lead to downfall.

(3) Comparison with Western (European) thought:

The concept in the story has some parallels in Western thought, particularly in the idea of the "vox populi, vox dei" (the voice of the people is the voice of God), which suggests that the collective wisdom of the people is important in making decisions. Additionally, the idea of seeking counsel from advisors and avoiding overconfidence is a common theme in both Eastern and Western philosophies. However, the specific focus on the value of those who can provide constructive criticism and the warning against self-conceit are more prominent in the teachings of Confucianism and other East Asian philosophies.<|im_end|>
