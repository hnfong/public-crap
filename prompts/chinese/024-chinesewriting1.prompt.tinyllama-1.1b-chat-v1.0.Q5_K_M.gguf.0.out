The Chinese spacecraft successfully reached the orbit of the moon.
The human voice is clear and steady,
A five-line verse, composed of four-line stanzas.
The first stanza is composed of three lines,
The second is composed of two lines,
The third is composed of five lines,
The last two lines are the same.

The first line expresses the triumph of human effort,
The second one the feat of scientific discovery,
The third line the joy of achievement,
The last two lines express gratitude for divine grace.

The five-line verse is a refrain,
A symbol of human progress and progress in space,
A reminder of the greatness of humanity,
A tribute to the untiring efforts of scientists and engineers.

The Chinese spacecraft has lifted off,
From the Chinese soil, with the spirit of humankind,
It has reached the heavens, and with pride,
We salute the Chinese astronauts who are here.

So, let us look towards the stars,
And dream of new adventures,
And celebrate the wonders of humanity,
And our boundless potential,

The Chinese spacecraft continues its journey,
Flying towards the moon, and beyond,
And we are cheering for them,
For humanity's boundless potential.
