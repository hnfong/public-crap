Sure, I'd be happy to discuss the two views on the importance of keeping promises.

Firstly, some people believe that following through on one's promises is a sign of honesty and trustworthiness. They argue that it shows that the person has made a commitment and is willing to stick to it, even if they encounter difficulties or setbacks along the way. This perspective is commonly known as "trust in action."

On the other hand, others believe that giving up on promises or breaking them is a sign of laziness, disrespect, or lack of responsibility. They argue that it shows that the person doesn't value commitments or doesn't care about their responsibilities. This perspective is commonly known as "trust in principle."

While both views have their merits and can be valid, I personally feel that both have their strengths and weaknesses. In terms of strengths, trust in action can help build strong relationships with others and foster a sense of loyalty and commitment. It can also help individuals to stay focused and motivated, as they can see the positive outcomes of sticking to promises. On the other hand, trust in principle can help individuals to avoid being taken advantage of or getting into debt by not honoring their commitments.

In terms of weaknesses, both views can cause issues when it comes to fulfilling commitments. When someone is trusted in action, they may feel pressure to keep their promises even when it's inconvenient or difficult, leading to a loss of freedom and autonomy. When someone is trusted in principle, they may feel like they have to follow through on their commitments even if it means sacrificing their own interests or priorities. This can lead to frustration and resentment, particularly if the person feels that the other party is untrustworthy or unreliable.

In conclusion, while both views on keeping promises have their strengths and weaknesses, I believe that trust in action is a more effective way to approach this subject. It can help individuals to build strong relationships and fulfill their commitments, while also avoiding the pitfalls of trust in principle. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide which view is most appropriate for their situation and relationship with others.
