Okay, let’s break down this passage from Xunzi.

**1. Translation into English:**

“Wei Wu-hou (魏武侯) planned his schemes and executed them flawlessly, so that no one among his ministers could match his success. He retired for the evening with a joyful expression. Wu Qi (吳起) stepped forward and said, ‘Have you ever heard of a saying attributed to King Zhuang of Chu (楚莊王) that was circulated among his advisors?’ Wei Wu-hou asked, ‘What did King Zhuang of Chu say?’ Wu Qi replied, ‘King Zhuang of Chu planned his schemes and executed them flawlessly, so that no one among his ministers could match his success. Upon retiring for the evening, he wore a troubled expression. Minister Shen Gong Wu (申公巫) approached and asked, ‘Why did he wear a troubled expression?’ King Zhuang replied, ‘Because he did not hesitate to undertake ambitious plans and execute them flawlessly, and no one among his ministers could match his success. The saying from the middle court states: ‘Lords who independently secure an army are kings, those who secure allies are masters, those who secure suspicion survive, and those who do not strive for schemes but are like themselves perish.’ Now, he has undertaken ambitious plans and executed them flawlessly, and no one among his ministers can match his success. Our state is nearing ruin! Therefore, he wears a troubled expression.’ King Zhuang wore a troubled expression, while the ruler wore a joyful expression.’”

Wei Wu-hou, upon hearing this, cautiously prostrated himself again and said, ‘The Master Angel (荀子) is pointing out my shortcomings.’”


**2. Explanation of the Moral of the Story:**

The core moral of this story is about the **danger of excessive ambition and the importance of fostering a collaborative and supportive environment within a state.**  Here's a breakdown of the key points:

* **Wei Wu-hou’s Success & Its Negative Consequences:** Wei Wu-hou’s single-minded drive to succeed, his refusal to delegate, and his insistence on doing everything himself created a situation where his ministers were intimidated and unable to contribute effectively.  His joy stemmed from *his* individual achievement, not from the prosperity of the state.
* **King Zhuang of Chu’s Wisdom:** King Zhuang of Chu recognized that *too much* success, achieved through relentless, solitary effort, could be detrimental.  He understood that a truly strong state relies on the contributions of its people.  His “middle court” quote highlights the importance of shared responsibility, mutual support, and a willingness to learn from others.  It’s not about individual brilliance, but about a collective effort.
* **The Ruler’s Role:** The King’s joyful reaction to Wei Wu-hou’s success contrasts sharply with the King of Chu’s troubled expression.  The ruler’s role isn’t simply to be the most capable individual, but to cultivate a system where everyone can thrive and contribute.
* **Xunzi’s Commentary:** Xunzi, through the Master Angel, emphasizes that Wei Wu-hou’s actions were exposing his own flaws – a lack of humility and an inability to recognize the value of his advisors.

Essentially, the story warns against the pitfalls of ego-driven leadership and advocates for a more balanced approach that values collaboration, delegation, and the well-being of the entire state. It’s a critique of a leader who prioritizes personal glory over the collective good.


**3. Counterparts in Western (European) Thought:**

Yes, the concepts in this story have significant parallels in Western philosophical and political thought, though they might be expressed differently. Here are a few key connections:

* **Plato’s *Republic*:** Plato’s ideal state emphasizes the importance of a wise and virtuous ruler, but crucially, he also advocates for a system of specialized roles and a council of elders to provide advice and check the ruler’s power. This mirrors the idea of shared responsibility and the need for diverse perspectives. The concept of “philosopher kings” is related, but Plato stresses the need for these rulers to be guided by reason and virtue, not simply driven by personal ambition.
* **Aristotle’s *Politics*:** Aristotle similarly emphasizes the importance of a well-ordered state with a balance of power and checks and balances. He discusses the dangers of tyranny and the benefits of a system where citizens participate in governance.
* **Machiavelli’s *The Prince* (with a caveat):** While Machiavelli is often associated with ruthless pragmatism, he also acknowledges the importance of a capable and respected court. A prince who alienates his advisors and relies solely on his own strength is likely to fail. However, Machiavelli’s focus is primarily on *practical* political success, whereas Xunzi’s is more concerned with ethical leadership.
* **The concept of “Collegiality” in Modern Governance:**  The idea of shared decision-making and collaborative governance, prevalent in many modern democracies, echoes the spirit of the King Zhuang of Chu’s “middle court” quote.  Cabinet systems, parliamentary oversight, and the importance of diverse viewpoints in policy-making all reflect this principle.
* **Stoicism:** The Stoic emphasis on virtue, reason, and the importance of contributing to the common good aligns with Xunzi’s critique of Wei Wu-hou’s self-centered ambition.


**In conclusion,** this short passage from Xunzi offers a timeless lesson about the complexities of leadership and the importance of fostering a virtuous and collaborative environment.  Its themes resonate deeply with Western political thought, demonstrating the enduring relevance of these ideas across cultures and historical periods.
