The Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735-1796) was a prominent Chinese emperor of the Qing Dynasty, who was born in the Shunzhi era (1661-1661) of the reign of the Shunzhi Emperor. He was the tenth emperor of the Shunzhi era, and the eighth emperor of the reign of the Kangxi Emperor. The Qianlong Emperor was the last emperor of the Qing Dynasty. He was also known as the "Emperor of the Great Peace" for his efforts to strengthen the Qing's control over the empire and bring peace to its people.

The Qianlong Emperor's early childhood is shrouded in mystery, as there are very few historical records about his infancy and early years. However, it is believed that he was born in the Shunzhi era, which was a time of great political instability and frequent power struggles in China. This environment may have contributed to his early interest in politics and his determination to become a powerful emperor.

In summary, the Qianlong Emperor's early life was marked by political instability and frequent power struggles, which may have contributed to his early interest in politics and his determination to become a powerful emperor.
