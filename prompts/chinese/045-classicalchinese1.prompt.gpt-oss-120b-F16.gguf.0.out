<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer all questions concisely but with points. Provide short summary, victims, beneficiaries, method, moral evaluation, and explanation of final comment comparing three officials (Zichan, Zixian? Actually 子產 (Zichan) of Zheng, 子賤 (Zixian?) maybe Zixian of Danfu, and 西门豹 of Ye). Need to discuss who is most virtuous, and fairness.

We need to be concise but thorough. Provide bullet points.

Let's craft answers.

Q1 summary: West Gate? Actually story about Ximen Bao as magistrate of Ye, discovering that local elders and officials were sacrificing girls to River God (He Bo) to appease floods, causing poverty. He stops the practice by exposing the sham, throwing the witch and elders into river, then builds twelve canals for irrigation, improving livelihood.

Q2 victims: Young women, especially beautiful girls, often from poor families, offered as brides to River God; also elderly witch and her disciples.

Q3 beneficiaries: The three elders (三老), the court clerks (廷掾), wealthy officials, and the witch/priestess who shared the money; also the state collected taxes.

Q4 method: He used both wit and force. He publicly exposed the fraud, used authority to order execution (force) but also clever rhetorical challenge, using the river as test, etc.

Q5 moral evaluation: From Confucian perspective, he protected innocent women, upheld righteousness, but used capital punishment extrajudicially, violating legal norms. From Legalist view, effective governance. From modern human rights, murder is immoral. Provide perspectives.

Q6 explanation: The passage compares three ancient administrators: Zichan of Zheng, Zixian of Danfu, Ximen Bao of Ye. It says under Zichan, people cannot be cheated; under Zixian, people cannot bear being cheated; under Ximen Bao, people dare not cheat. Which is most virtuous? Evaluate based on their reforms: Zichan known for law reforms, transparency; Zixian (maybe Zi Jian?) known for strict enforcement; Ximen Bao for infrastructure and ending superstition. Argue that Ximen Bao perhaps most benevolent because he improved livelihood and eliminated harmful ritual, but Zichan's legal reforms also important. Provide fairness assessment.

Let's craft final answer with points.

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Q1 – Short summary (5 pts)**  

- Ximen Bao (西門豹) is appointed magistrate of Ye (邺).  
- He learns that the three senior elders (三老), the court clerks (廷掾) and a witch‑priestess (巫祝) annually “marry” a girl to the River‑God He Bo (河伯) in order to keep the river from flooding.  
- The ritual costs millions of coins, the money is split among the officials and the witch, and the chosen girl (usually a beautiful young woman) is cast into the river and drowned.  
- Ximen Bao publicly exposes the fraud, orders the witch, her disciples and the three elders to be thrown into the river, and then stops the custom.  
- He then orders the digging of twelve irrigation canals, bringing water to the fields, ending the people’s poverty and the superstition.  

---

**Q2 – Typical victims (2 pts)**  

- **Young, attractive girls** (often from poor families) who were selected as “brides” for the River‑God and sacrificed in the ritual.  

---

**Q3 – Who benefited from the old practice? (2 pts)**  

- The **three senior elders** (三老) and the **court clerks/officials** (廷掾) who collected the tax‑like tribute.  
- The **witch‑priestess** and her disciples, who received a share of the money and enjoyed the prestige of the “ritual”.  

---

**Q4 – Wits or force? (5 pts)**  

- **Both.**  
  1. **Wit / rhetorical strategy** – Ximen Bao first questions the “beauty” of the chosen girl, thereby undermining the legitimacy of the ritual and turning public opinion against it.  
  2. **Authority & force** – He orders the witch, her disciples and the three elders to be thrown into the river, a direct use of state power (extrajudicial execution).  
  3. He also **uses the river itself as a test** (“let the River‑God choose”) to expose the sham, then **orders the construction of canals** to solve the underlying problem (flooding) that the ritual pretended to address.  

Thus the reform is achieved through clever manipulation of ritual logic *and* the decisive, violent application of magistrate power.

**Q5 – Moral assessment (10 pts)**  

| Perspective | Verdict & Reasoning |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Confucian** | *Positive*: Ximen Bao protects innocent women, ends a harmful superstition, and provides for the people (仁, 义). <br>*Negative*: He bypasses proper legal procedure; extrajudicial killings violate the principle of **礼** and the ruler’s duty to uphold the law (法). |
| **Legalist** | *Positive*: The outcome restores order, eliminates a costly “ritual tax”, and increases state revenue through irrigation (功). The use of swift, harsh punishment is consistent with “治而后乱”. |
| **Daoist / folk‑religious** | *Negative*: He destroys a traditional rite that, however superstitious, was believed to keep the river calm; the community may view the act as hubristic interference with natural forces. |
| **Modern human‑rights** | *Negative*: Murder of the witch, her disciples and the elders, even if they were corrupt, is a violation of the right to life and due process. The ends do not justify the means. |
| **Pragmatic/ utilitarian** | *Mixed*: The lives saved (thousands of women, the whole populace) outweigh the few deaths; the long‑term welfare gain (irrigation, prosperity) can be seen as morally defensible. |

Overall, the act is **morally ambiguous**: it is laudable for rescuing victims and improving livelihoods, but it employs unlawful violence that conflicts with several ethical frameworks.

**Q6 – “子產治鄭…西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。” – Which of the three was the most capable? (15 pts)**  

1. **Textual meaning**  
   - *子產* (Zǐ Cán, Ǒu Zichan of Zheng) – under his rule the people **could not be cheated**.  
   - *子賤* (Zǐ Jiàn, usually identified as Zǐ Jiàn of Dan‑fu) – under his rule the people **could not endure being cheated** (i.e., they would resist).  
   - *西門豹* (Ximen Bao of Ye) – under his rule the people **did not dare to cheat** (they were too frightened to attempt fraud).  

   The passage is a comparative appraisal of three famous administrators, emphasizing the **degree of control** they exercised over popular misconduct.  

2. **Evaluation of fairness**  

   - **Zǐ Cán** (c. 544‑476 BC) is celebrated for **transparent law‑making**, the “*Yin‑law*” (陰法) that made statutes public, thereby preventing officials from exploiting secret edicts. His achievement lies in **institutional reform** that protects the populace from systemic abuse.  
   - **Zǐ Jiàn** (often identified with *Zǐ Jian* of Dan‑fu, 5th c. BC) is known for **strict enforcement**; he punished corrupt officials harshly, so the people could not *tolerate* cheating. His method is **repressive but effective**.  
   - **Ximen Bao** (3rd c. BC) eliminated a **superstitious exploitation** (the River‑God marriage) and built **twelve irrigation canals**, providing material welfare. The fear he inspired (“民不敢欺”) stems from his **personal authority and willingness to use force** against the ritual leaders.  

   **Who is “most virtuous”?**  
   - If “most virtuous” is measured by **lasting institutional integrity**, Zǐ Cán’s public law‑code is arguably the highest achievement.  
   - If “most virtuous” is judged by **direct relief of the people’s material suffering**, Ximen Bao’s canals and eradication of a deadly custom give him the edge.  
   - If “most virtuous” is defined by **moral firmness against corruption**, Zǐ Jiàn’s uncompromising punishments rank highly.  

   The comment in the passage **reduces the comparison to a single metric – the degree of fear or inability to cheat** – which overlooks the different **domains of governance** (legal transparency, punitive enforcement, socio‑economic development). Therefore the statement is **partially fair**: it correctly notes that each official succeeded in curbing fraud, but it is **not a comprehensive assessment** of overall merit. A more balanced judgment would recognize that **all three excelled in distinct, complementary ways**, and the “most capable” depends on the values one privileges (rule of law, social welfare, or strict order).  

---  

**Bottom line:** Ximen Bao’s story illustrates a dramatic, morally complex reform that combines shrewd rhetorical attack with brutal coercion, ending a harmful superstition and delivering lasting economic benefit. Whether his methods are justified depends on the ethical lens applied, and the ancient ranking of him alongside Zǐ Cán and Zǐ Jiàn, while highlighting his effectiveness, simplifies the richer picture of their respective contributions.
