<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer six questions, each with point values. Provide concise answers. Need to summarize story, identify victims, beneficiaries, method (wits vs force), moral evaluation, and explain the final comparison and fairness.

We need to understand the story: It's about Ximen Bao (西门豹), a famous official in the State of Wei (魏文侯). He discovers a corrupt tradition: the River God (河伯) is "married" to a woman each year, a ritual where officials (三老,廷掾) collect taxes, take a large sum, give part to the River God ceremony, and a witch (巫祝) selects a girl, dresses her, builds a palace on the river, and then floats her down the river; she drowns after traveling tens of miles. Families hide daughters to avoid being taken, leading to depopulation and poverty. Ximen Bao decides to intervene. He goes to the river with officials and many people. He inspects the selected girl and declares her unsuitable, orders the old witch and her disciples to be thrown into the river instead, then does the same to the three elders, etc., using force (throwing them in). He then stops the practice. He also builds twelve canals to irrigate fields, improving agriculture.

Thus answers.

Q2: victims were young women, often beautiful girls, selected by the witch, often from poor families; they were forced to be "wives" of the River God, essentially sacrificed.

Q3: beneficiaries: corrupt officials (三老,廷掾) and the witch/priestess (巫祝) who collected money and shared the proceeds; also the state (maybe) but mainly the officials and the witch.

Q4: He used both wits (declaring the girl unsuitable, using authority) and force (throwing people into river). The main method was forceful execution to stop the ritual, but also cunning to expose the corruption.

Q5: Moral evaluation: From Confucian perspective, he protected innocent women, eliminated corruption, thus moral. From legalist perspective, he used extrajudicial killing, violating rule of law, thus questionable. From modern human rights view, his killing of the witch and elders is still violent, but perhaps justified as ending human sacrifice. Provide multiple perspectives.

Q6: The passage compares three historical figures: Zichan (子產) of Zheng, Zixian? Actually "子賤" maybe "子賤" (Zijian?) who governed Danfu; and Ximen Bao. It says: Zichan's governance made people unable to cheat him; Zijian's governance made people unable to endure cheating; Ximen Bao's governance made people not dare to cheat. Which is most virtuous? Need to explain meaning: Zichan's rule was so strict that people could not cheat; Zijian's rule was so humane that people could not bear to cheat; Ximen Bao's rule was so powerful that people were afraid to cheat. Evaluate fairness: All three are praised; Ximen Bao's method (using force) may be less moral than Zichan's legal reforms; but the comment may be biased. Provide analysis.

Let's craft concise answers, each with point allocation but not necessary to show points.

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**Q1 – Summary (5 pts)**  
During the reign of Wei‑Wen‑hou, Ximen Bao was appointed magistrate of Yè. He learns that the “River‑God marriage” ritual – a yearly sacrifice of a young woman to the river deity – is a sham concoced by the three senior officials (三老) and the local witch‑priestess. They collect millions of coins in taxes, spend a fraction on a lavish ceremony, and then drown the chosen girl, while families hide their daughters out of fear. Ximen Bao publicly exposes the fraud, declares the selected girl unsuitable, and orders the witch, her disciples and the three elders to be thrown into the river. The ritual is abolished. He then builds twelve irrigation canals, turning the flood‑prone plain into productive farmland and securing lasting prosperity for the people.

---

**Q2 – Typical victims (2 pts)**  
*Young, unmarried girls (usually beautiful and of marriage‑able age) who were selected by the witch as the “wife of the River‑God.”*  

---

**Q3 – Who profited? (2 pts)**  
*The corrupt local officials (the three elders and the court clerks 廷掾) who skimmed the tax revenue, and the witch‑priestess 巫祝 who received a share of the money and the prestige of the ritual.*  

---

**Q4 – Wits or force? (5 pts)**  
Ximen Bao combined **strategic wit** with **raw force**.  
1. **Wit:** He first inspects the “bride,” declares her “unsuitable,” and thereby creates a pretext to halt the ceremony without a direct confrontation with the crowd.  
2. **Force:** He then orders the witch, her disciples and the three elders to be thrown into the river, and later threatens the remaining officials, using the authority of the magistrate’s sword and the spectacle of public execution.  
Thus the ending of the practice was achieved through a calculated display of power rather than through legal reform alone.

---

**Q5 – Moral assessment (10 pts)**  

| Perspective | Verdict & Reasoning |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Confucian** | Moral – Ximen Bao protects innocent women, removes a corrupt custom, and restores the “Mandate of Heaven.” The ends (social harmony) justify the means, and his actions reflect the ruler’s duty to care for the people. |
| **Legalist** | Pragmatically moral – the state’s stability outweighs procedural legality. Extrajudicial killing is acceptable if it eliminates a threat to order and increases revenue (the canals). |
| **Daoist / “soft” ethic** | Questionable – the violent elimination of the witch and elders mirrors the cruelty of the old rite; a more compassionate, non‑violent reform would be preferred. |
| **Modern human‑rights** | Mixed – the rescue of girls is commendable, but the summary executions violate the right to due process and the principle of proportionality. The act is seen as “vigilante justice.” |
| **Historical‑literary** | Positive – the story is a didactic exemplar of a righteous official; moral judgment is shaped by the author’s intent to praise Ximen Bao’s decisive leadership. |

Overall, most traditional Chinese evaluations deem the act moral because the greater good (ending human sacrifice and establishing irrigation) outweighs the violent means; contemporary lenses would be more critical of the extrajudicial killings.

**Q6 – “子產治鄭…西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。” – which is the greatest? (15 pts)**  

**Explanation of the passage**  
- **子產** (Zichan, 502‑426 BC, State of Zheng) is praised for establishing strict laws so that *people could not cheat him*; his governance relied on clear statutes and impartial enforcement.  
- **子賤** (Zijian, ruler of Dan‑fu) is lauded for a humane administration that made *people unwilling to cheat*; his virtue inspired voluntary compliance.  
- **西門豹** (Ximen Bao, 4th c. BC, Wei) is said to have made *people afraid to cheat*; his authority and decisive, sometimes forceful, actions suppressed corruption.

**Who is “most virtuous”?**  
- From a **Confucian meritocratic** view, Zichan’s rule is the highest because it achieves order through moral law rather than intimidation.  
- From a **Legalist** standpoint, Ximen Bao’s ability to make people *fear* cheating is the most effective for state power.  
- From a **humanistic** angle, Zijian’s method—winning people’s goodwill so they *refuse* to cheat—is ethically superior.

**Is the comment fair?**  
The comment reflects the author’s bias toward **effective, decisive governance** (the “heroic magistrate” model). It lumps together three very different strategies—legal codification, moral example, and coercive authority—without weighing their ethical costs. While Ximen Bao’s achievements (ending a deadly ritual and creating lasting irrigation) are indeed impressive, his reliance on extrajudicial violence makes his “most virtuous” claim contestable when measured against Zichan’s rule‑by‑law or Zijian’s benevolent persuasion. Therefore, the statement is **partially fair** as a literary accolade but **not an objective ranking** of moral superiority. [end of text]
