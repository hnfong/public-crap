Alright, I need to answer the question about Qin Shi Huang's family members and whether his childhood was happy. First, let's recall who Qin Shi Huang was. Qin Shi Huang was the first Emperor of a unified China, reigning from 221 to 210 BC. He was the king of the Qin state before unifying the other six major states.

Now, considering his family, Qin Shi Huang was the son of King Zhuangxiang of Qin and his concubine, Lady Zhao. His given name was Ying Zheng. Since he was born into royalty, he had siblings, but I need to identify who they were. I recall that his half-brother was Prince Fusu, who was also a potential heir before Qin Shi Huang made him his successor.

Regarding his childhood, historical records suggest that Qin Shi Huang's early life was marked by political instability and power struggles within the Qin court. His father, King Zhuangxiang, died shortly after Qin Shi Huang ascended the throne at the age of 13. This sudden change in leadership likely created a tense environment for the young emperor.

Moreover, Qin Shi Huang was known to be a strict and ambitious ruler from a young age. He was educated in military strategy and administration, which prepared him for his future role. However, this rigorous upbringing might have contributed to a less happy childhood, as he was expected to follow a strict path to the throne.

Additionally, there were attempts to assassinate him early in his reign, which could have added to the stress and lack of safety in his childhood. The constant threat of rebellion and the need to maintain power might have overshadowed any personal happiness.

In summary, while Qin Shi Huang was born into a royal family with siblings, his childhood was likely overshadowed by political intrigue, the early loss of his father, and the responsibilities that came with being the heir apparent. These factors probably contributed to a less happy childhood compared to what one might consider a typical royal upbringing.

秦始皇的家人包括他的父亲庄襄王和母亲赵姬。他有一个同父异母的哥哥，即公子扶苏。关于他的童年，秦始皇在13岁时继承王位，由于政治上的不稳定和宫廷内的权力斗争，他的童年生活并不快乐。他从小接受严格的军事和行政教育，这为他后来成为皇帝奠定了基础。此外，他早年曾面临多次刺杀企图，增加了他童年时期的紧张和不安全感。因此，秦始皇的童年虽然拥有皇室的身份，但由于政治环境的复杂和责任的重压，他的童年生活并不开心。
