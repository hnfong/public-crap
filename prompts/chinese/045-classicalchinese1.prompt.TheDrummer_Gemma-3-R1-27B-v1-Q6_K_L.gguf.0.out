## Answers to Questions on 西門豹 (from 滑稽列傳)

**Q1: Give a short summary of the story (5 points)**

Westmen Leopard, as magistrate of Ye, discovered the people were impoverished by a corrupt practice: elders, officials, and shamans extorted money to "marry" girls to the River God (He Bo) – essentially drowning them for profit. Leopard publicly demanded to see the "bride" and then dramatically threw the shaman, her disciples, and the corrupt elders into the river during the ceremony, terrifying the populace into ending the practice. He then built irrigation canals, bringing prosperity to Ye, and his legacy endured even when later officials tried to alter his work.

**Q2: What kind of women were usually the victims in the story (2 points)**

Young, pretty girls ("小家女好者") were targeted. The shamans would identify attractive girls and force their families to participate in the "marriage" ritual.

**Q3. Who were deemed to benefit from the old practice of offering girls? (2 points)**

The "three elders" (三老), court officials (廷掾), and the shamans/witches (祝巫) benefited financially. They collected money from the people under the guise of the river god's marriage, keeping the majority for themselves.

**Q4: Did the protagonist use wits or force to deal with the situation? Explain (5 points)**

Primarily **force**, but cleverly disguised as a demonstration of the practice's absurdity. Leopard used a calculated, theatrical display of violence (throwing the shaman, disciples, and elders into the river) to achieve his goal. While he used words to provoke the situation ("Is this girl pretty?"), the resolution was entirely physical and terrifying. The "wits" lay in understanding the power of spectacle and fear to dismantle the corrupt system.

**Q5: Was it moral for the protagonist to do so? Briefly provide views from various perspectives (10 points).**

*   **Pro-Leopard (Utilitarian/Pragmatic):** Highly moral. He saved countless future victims and brought lasting prosperity to the people. The ends (public good) justified the extreme means (preventing future harm).
*   **Anti-Leopard (Deontological/Legalistic):** Immoral. He committed murder (even if of corrupt officials) and used state-sanctioned violence. His actions were illegal and set a dangerous precedent.
*   **Nuanced (Contextual):** Morally ambiguous. While the practice was horrific, Leopard's actions were brutal and extrajudicial. However, the corrupt system was deeply entrenched, and conventional methods likely wouldn't have worked. His actions were extreme but effective in a desperate situation.
*   **Victim's Perspective:** The families of the drowned officials would see it as monstrous. The potential future victims would see it as salvation.

**Q6: At the end of 滑稽列傳, it is said that: "傳曰：「子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。」三子之才能誰最賢哉？辨治者當能別之。" -- explain what it means, and whether the comment is fair. (15 points)**

**Meaning:** The passage contrasts the governing styles of three historical figures:

*   **Zichan (子產) of Zheng:** Ruled so justly that people *could not* deceive him (due to his wisdom and incorruptibility).
*   **Zixian (子賤) of Danfu:** Ruled so benevolently that people *would not* deceive him (out of respect and affection).
*   **Ximen Leopard (西門豹) of Ye:** Ruled so fearfully that people *dared not* deceive him (out of terror).

The question asks which of the three was the most talented ruler. The concluding statement asserts that a discerning ruler should be able to distinguish between these different approaches.

**Fairness of the Comment:** The comment is **fair and insightful**. It highlights that effective governance can be achieved through different means – integrity, benevolence, or fear. It doesn't declare one superior but emphasizes the importance of understanding the nuances of each approach.

*   **Why it's fair:** Leopard's method, while effective in ending the corruption, relied on intimidation. It wasn't based on earning trust or respect. The comparison forces us to consider the ethical implications of ruling through fear versus
