This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

**Translation:**

Marquis Wu of Wei was planning something and succeeded, but none of his ministers could understand how he did it. After the court session, he had a pleased expression. Wu Qi approached him and said, "Have you ever heard the story of King Zhuang of Chu?" Marquis Wu asked, "What's the story about King Zhuang of Chu?" Wu Qi replied, "King Zhuang of Chu was planning something and succeeded, but none of his ministers could understand how he did it. After the court session, he had a worried expression. Shen Gong Wu Chen approached him and asked, 'Why do you look worried, Your Majesty?' King Zhuang said, 'I'm worried because I planned something and succeeded, but none of my ministers could understand how I did it. According to the saying of Zhongzi, "A ruler who finds a worthy teacher will become a king, one who finds a worthy friend will become a hegemon, one who finds a worthy advisor will survive, but one who relies solely on himself and has no one to match him will perish." Now, I, an unworthy ruler, have succeeded without anyone understanding how, which means our country is on the verge of destruction! That's why I'm worried.' King Zhuang of Chu was worried, but you, on the other hand, are pleased." Marquis Wu was taken aback, bowed twice, and said, "Heaven has sent you to correct my mistakes."

**Moral of the story:**

The moral of the story is that a ruler should be worried if they are the only one who understands their plans and decisions, and no one else can match their wisdom. This is because it indicates a lack of capable advisors and a reliance on the ruler's own limited abilities, which can lead to the downfall of the state. A good ruler should surround themselves with wise and capable advisors and be willing to listen to their counsel.

**Counterpart in Western thought:**

The concept of the importance of having wise advisors and not relying solely on one's own judgment has a counterpart in Western thought. In ancient Greece, the concept of "eunomia" (εὐνομία) referred to the idea of good order and wise governance, which was often associated with the presence of wise advisors and counselors. The Greek historian Herodotus, for example, wrote about the importance of having wise advisors in his Histories.

In modern Western thought, the concept of "groupthink" (coined by Irving Janis in 1972) refers to the phenomenon where a group of individuals, including leaders, make irrational or poor decisions because they are isolated from outside perspectives and rely too heavily on their own limited knowledge and biases. This concept is similar to the idea presented in the story, where a ruler's reliance on their own judgment without input from others can lead to poor decision-making.

Additionally, the idea of seeking counsel from others and being open to criticism is a common theme in Western philosophy, particularly in the works of Aristotle, who emphasized the importance of "phronesis" (φρόνησις), or practical wisdom, which involves seeking the advice of others and considering multiple perspectives.
