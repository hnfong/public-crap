(1) The story is translated into English as follows:

"King Wei of Wei planned his affairs and was in charge, but the ministers were unable to catch up. He retired and showed a happy expression. Wu Qi said: 'Have you ever heard of the Chu Duke's words, which were heard by his right-hand men?' King Wei said: 'What did the Chu Duke say?' Wu Qi replied: 'The Chu Duke planned his affairs and was in charge, but the ministers were unable to catch up. Wu Qi asked: 'Why did the Chu Duke show a happy expression?' King Wei said: 'He did not know how to plan his affairs and the ministers were unable to catch up, so he showed a happy expression.'"

(2) The moral of the story is that when a leader plans his affairs and is in charge, the ministers are unable to catch up, and the leader should not show a happy expression. This is a warning to leaders to not show a happy expression when they are in charge, as it can lead to a situation where the ministers are unable to catch up and the leader is in danger.

(3) The concepts in the story have a counterpart in Western (European) thought in the form of the concept of "planning and being in charge" or "being in charge and not knowing how to plan." This concept is similar to the idea of "planning and being in charge" or "being in charge and not knowing how to plan" in the Chinese story. The Chinese story is a metaphor for the idea of "planning and being in charge" or "being in charge and not knowing how to plan" in the Western (European) thought. [end of text]
