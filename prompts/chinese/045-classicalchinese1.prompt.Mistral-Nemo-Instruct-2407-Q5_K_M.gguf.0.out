Consider the following text from 滑稽列传 and answer questions:

```
魏文侯时，西门豹为邺令。豹往到邺，会长老，问之民所疾苦。长老曰：「苦为河伯娶妇，以故贫。」豹问其故，对曰：「邺三老、廷掾常岁赋敛百姓，收取其钱得数百万，用其二三十万为河伯娶妇，与祝巫共分其余钱持归。当其时，巫行视小家女好者，云是当为河伯妇，即娉取。洗沐之，为治新缯绮縠衣，闲居斋戒；为治斋宫河上，张缇绛帷，女居其中。为具牛酒饭食，行十余日。共粉饰之，如嫁女床席，令女居其上，浮之河中。始浮，行数十里乃没。其人家有好女者，恐大巫祝为河伯取之，以故多持女远逃亡。以故城中益空无人，又困贫，所从来久远矣。民人俗语曰『即不为河伯娶妇，水来漂没，溺其人民』云。」西门豹曰：「至为河伯娶妇时，愿三老、巫祝、父老送女河上，幸来告语之，吾亦往送女。」皆曰：「诺。」

至其时，西门豹往会之河上。三老、官属、豪长者、里父老皆会，以人民往观之者三二千人。其巫，老女子也，已年七十。从弟子女十人所，皆衣缯单衣，立大巫后。西门豹曰：「呼河伯妇来，视其好丑。」即将女出帷中，来至前。豹视之，顾谓三老、巫祝、父老曰：「是女子不好，烦大巫妪为入报河伯，得更求好女，后日送之。」即使吏卒共抱大巫妪投之河中。有顷，曰：「巫妪何久也？弟子趣之！」复以弟子一人投河中。有顷，曰：「弟子何久也？复使一人趣之！」复投一弟子河中。凡投三弟子。西门豹曰：「巫妪弟子是女子也，不能白事，烦三老为入白之。」复投三老河中。西门豹簪笔磬折，向河立待良久。长老、吏傍观者皆惊恐。西门豹顾曰：「巫妪、三老不来还，柰之何？」欲复使廷掾与豪长者一人入趣之。皆叩头，叩头且破，额血流地，色如死灰。西门豹曰：「诺，且留待之须臾。」须臾，豹曰：「廷掾起矣。状河伯留客之久，若皆罢去归矣。」邺吏民大惊恐，从是以后，不敢复言为河伯娶妇。

西门豹即发民凿十二渠，引河水灌民田，田皆溉。当其时，民治渠少烦苦，不欲也。豹曰：「民可以乐成，不可与虑始。今父老子弟虽患苦我，然百岁后期令父老子孙思我言。」至今皆得水利，民人以给足富。十二渠经绝驰道，到汉之立，而长吏以为十二渠桥绝驰道，相比近，不可。欲合渠水，且至驰道合三渠为一桥。邺民人父老不肯听长吏，以为西门君所为也，贤君之法式不可更也。长吏终听置之。故西门豹为邺令，名闻天下，泽流后世，无绝已时，几可谓非贤大夫哉！

**Q1:** West Gate Commander Xiang Yu (Xiang Yu) was appointed as the governor of Ye during the reign of King Wen of Wei. Upon arrival, he asked the elders about the people's hardships. They replied, "We suffer from having to marry off a wife to the River God." Xiang Yu asked why, and they explained that every year, the three elders and the official in charge would collect money from the people, amounting to several hundred thousand, of which they would spend around 20-30 thousand to marry off a girl to the River God, and then divide the remaining money with the sorcerers and take it home. At that time, the sorcerers would inspect the young girls in the households, and if they found one they liked, they would take her as the River God's bride. They would then wash and clean her, dress her in new silk and brocade clothes, and let her live in seclusion while fasting and praying. They would then build a temporary palace by the river, hang red curtains, and place the girl inside. They would prepare oxen, wine, and food, and after ten days, they would apply makeup to the girl, place her on a bed, and float her down the river. The girl would float for several dozen li before sinking. Those who had beautiful daughters were afraid that the sorcerers would take them as the River God's bride, so they would often take their daughters and flee far away. As a result, the city became increasingly empty and poor, and this had been going on for a long time. The people said, "Even if we don't marry off a wife to the River God, the water will flood and drown our people." Xiang Yu said, "When it's time to marry off the River God's bride, I hope the three elders, sorcerers, and elders will send her off to the river, and I will also go to send her off." They all agreed.

**Q2:** The women who were usually the victims were young girls from wealthy households.

**Q3:** The three elders and the official in charge, as well as the sorcerers, benefited from the old practice of offering girls.

**Q4:** Xiang Yu used wits to deal with the situation. He exposed the fraud of the sorcerers and the three elders by having them send off the River God's bride themselves, and then having them thrown into the river one by one. He also used the threat of force to intimidate the three elders and the sorcerers, making them terrified and willing to comply with his demands.

**Q5:** From the perspective of the people, Xiang Yu's actions were moral because he put an end to the corrupt practice of offering girls to the River God, which had caused great suffering to the people. From the perspective of the three elders and the sorcerers, Xiang Yu's actions were immoral because he used deceit and force to harm them. From the perspective of the law, Xiang Yu's actions were illegal because he used extrajudicial means to punish the three elders and the sorcerers. From the perspective of Confucian ethics, Xiang Yu's actions were immoral because he did not follow the proper rituals and ceremonies, and he used force to intimidate and harm others.

**Q6:** The passage means that the three wise men (Xiang Yu, Zi Chan, and Zi Ran) had different abilities in governing. Xiang Yu was able to prevent the people from deceiving him, Zi Ran was able to prevent the people from daring to deceive him, and Zi Chan was able to prevent the people from wanting to deceive him. The comment is fair because it accurately describes the different abilities of the three wise men in governing. However, it is also possible to argue that the comment is not entirely fair because it only considers the ability to prevent deception and does not take into account other important aspects of governing, such as the ability to promote the well-being of the people.
