魏文侯时，西门豹为邺令。豹往到邺，会长老，问之民所疾苦。长老曰：「苦为河伯娶妇，以故贫。」豹问其故，对曰：「邺三老、廷掾常岁赋敛百姓，收取其钱得数百万，用其二三十万为河伯娶妇，与祝巫共分其余钱持归。当其时，巫行视小家女好者，云是当为河伯妇，即娉取。洗沐之，为治新缯绮縠衣，闲居斋戒；为治斋宫河上，张缇绛帷，女居其中。为具牛酒饭食，行十余日。共粉饰之，如嫁女床席，令女居其上，浮之河中。始浮，行数十里乃没。其人家有好女者，恐大巫祝为河伯取之，以故多持女远逃亡。以故城中益空无人，又困贫，所从来久远矣。民人俗语曰『即不为河伯娶妇，水来漂没，溺其人民』云。」西门豹曰：「至为河伯娶妇时，愿三老、巫祝、父老送女河上，幸来告语之，吾亦往送女。」皆曰：「诺。」

至其时，西门豹往会之河上。三老、官属、豪长者、里父老皆会，以人民往观之者三二千人。其巫，老女子也，已年七十。从弟子女十人所，皆衣缯单衣，立大巫后。西门豹曰：「呼河伯妇来，视其好丑。」即将女出帷中，来至前。豹视之，顾谓三老、巫祝、父老曰：「是女子不好，烦大巫妪为入报河伯，得更求好女，后日送之。」即使吏卒共抱大巫妪投之河中。有顷，曰：「巫妪何久也？弟子趣之！」复以弟子一人投河中。有顷，曰：「弟子何久也？复使一人趣之！」复投一弟子河中。凡投三弟子。西门豹曰：「巫妪弟子是女子也，不能白事，烦三老为入白之。」复投三老河中。西门豹簪笔磬折，向河立待良久。长老、吏傍观者皆惊恐。西门豹顾曰：「巫妪、三老不来还，柰之何？」欲复使廷掾与豪长者一人入趣之。皆叩头，叩头且破，额血流地，色如死灰。西门豹曰：「诺，且留待之须臾。」须臾，豹曰：「廷掾起矣。状河伯留客之久，若皆罢去归矣。」邺吏民大惊恐，从是以后，不敢复言为河伯娶妇。

西门豹即发民凿十二渠，引河水灌民田，田皆溉。当其时，民治渠少烦苦，不欲也。豹曰：「民可以乐成，不可与虑始。今父老子弟虽患苦我，然百岁后期令父老子孙思我言。」至今皆得水利，民人以给足富。十二渠经绝驰道，到汉之立，而长吏以为十二渠桥绝驰道，相比近，不可。欲合渠水，且至驰道合三渠为一桥。邺民人父老不肯听长吏，以为西门君所为也，贤君之法式不可更也。长吏终听置之。故西门豹为邺令，名闻天下，泽流后世，无绝已时，几可谓非贤大夫哉！

Keep your answers concise.

<AI> Q1: The story is about the Chinese historical figure, 西门豹 (Xīmén Bà), who was appointed as the邺令 (Yè zhèn lì) during the Wei dynasty. He discovered that the people of邺 (Yè) were suffering from the practice of offering girls to the "河伯" (hé bó), which was causing poverty among the people. The old practice involved the "三老" (sān lǎo), or three elders, along with "廷掾" (tíng yán), or court officials, often using the money collected from taxing the people to buy girls for the "河伯" to marry and enrich themselves.

Q2: The women who were usually the victims in the story were young girls who were often chosen by the "三老" and "廷掾" for the "河伯" to marry. They were taken away from their families and treated poorly, often being subjected to harsh treatment and forced to live in the "斋宫河上" (sāi gōng hé shàng), a place set up for the "河伯" to reside on the river.

Q3: The people who benefited from the old practice were the "三老" (sān lǎo) and "廷掾" (tíng yán), who often used the money collected from taxing the people to buy girls for the "河伯" to marry and enrich themselves. They were considered to be the main beneficiaries of the practice.

Q4: The protagonist, 西门豹 (Xīmén Bà), used a combination of wit and force to deal with the situation. He initially used wit by asking the people why they were suffering and understanding the root cause of their poverty. He then used force by ordering his subordinates to physically remove the "河伯"'s wife (the girl) from the "斋宫河上" and throwing her in the river. This was a powerful and direct action that showed his determination to end the practice of offering girls to the "河伯".

Q5: It is possible to have different views on whether it was moral for the protagonist to do so. Some may argue that it was morally right because it ended the suffering and poverty of the people in the region. Others may argue that it was not moral because it involved using force to remove someone from their home and causing them emotional distress. However, it is important to note that the protagonist's actions were motivated by his desire to benefit the people and improve their livelihoods.

Q6: The passage states that "傳曰：「子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。」三子之才能誰最賢哉？辨治者當能別之。" The comment in question refers to the three heroes, 子產 (Zǐ Cài), 單父宰 (Dān Fù Zǎi), and 西門豹 (Xīmén Bà), who were said to have been wise and capable leaders. The passage suggests that each of these leaders had a unique approach to governance, and the comment implies that it is up to the individual reader to decide which leader is the most capable. This comment is fair because it acknowledges the different approaches to governance and encourages the reader to consider the merits of each leader. However, it is important to note that the passage does not explicitly compare the three leaders and their respective approaches to governance.</s>
