Okay, let me start by carefully reading the user's query and the provided text. The user has given a passage from "滑稽列传" about西门豹 and asks six questions. I need to answer each concisely while ensuring accuracy.

First, Q1 asks for a short summary. The story is about西门豹 stopping the sacrifice of girls to the river god by tricking the officials into throwing the witch and others into the river, then building canals for irrigation. I should highlight the key points: the corrupt practice,西门豹's method, and the long-term benefits.

Q2: What kind of women were victims? The text mentions "小家女好者" – poor but pretty girls from humble families. So, young, attractive, poor girls.

Q3: Who benefited? The三老、廷掾、祝巫 and officials who embezzled funds. They split the money collected from the people.

Q4: Did he use wits or force? He used both: deception to expose the fraud (wits) and then force by having them thrown in. But the initial approach was cunning, not brute force.

Q5: Morality? Need multiple perspectives. From utilitarian view, it saved lives and improved agriculture. From deontological, killing is wrong even if for good ends. From cultural relativism, he broke norms but ended a harmful tradition. Also, his methods were ruthless but effective.

Q6: The quote compares three officials.子产: people don't dare cheat;子贱: people don't want to cheat;西门豹: people are too scared to cheat. The comment questions who was most virtuous. Fair?西门豹's fear-based rule is less ideal than moral influence, but effective in stopping immediate harm. However, long-term, his infrastructure projects brought real benefits, so maybe his approach was contextually necessary.

Wait, the user wants concise answers. I should avoid lengthy explanations. For Q6, explain the quote and assess fairness:西门豹's method was harsh but effective, though not as morally superior as the others. But his lasting legacy might balance it.

Double-check the text:西门豹 didn't just use fear; he implemented lasting reforms. So the comment might undervalue his practical achievements. But the quote focuses on governance style, not outcomes. So it's fair in terms of method but incomplete without considering results.

Make sure each answer is brief. Q5 needs multiple perspectives but keep it tight. Q6 is 15 points, so more detail but still concise.

**Q1: Short Summary**  
西门豹任邺令时，揭露并废除“河伯娶妇”的陋习（实为官吏与巫祝勾结骗取钱财、残害少女），设计将巫祝、三老等投入河中，震慑 corrupt officials。随后发动民众开凿十二渠灌溉农田，长期造福百姓，使邺地富足，其政绩流芳后世。

**Q2: Victims**  
贫困家庭中容貌较好的年轻女子（“小家女好者”）。

**Q3: Beneficiaries**  
地方官吏（三老、廷掾）、巫祝及豪强，他们通过征收“娶妇钱”中饱私囊。

**Q4: Wits vs. Force**  
主要运用**智谋（欺骗与心理战术）**：以“女子不好，需重选”为由，假借河伯名义， successive 将巫祝、弟子、三老投入河中，制造“河伯留客”的假象，迫使 corrupt officials 在恐惧中屈服。虽最终动用强制手段，但核心是借迷信反迷信，以最小代价破除积弊。

**Q5: Morality – Multiple Perspectives**  
- **Utilitarian view**: 道德。以短期“欺骗”与 minimal 暴力终结长期害命陋习，并带来永久水利工程，最大化民众福祉。  
- **Deontological view**: 不道德。故意杀人（即使对象是恶人）违背“不可杀人”的绝对准则，手段残忍。  
- **Virtue ethics view**: 复杂。其勇气、智慧与惠民之果可称“贤”，但手段阴狠，与“仁政”理想有距。  
- **Contextual view**: 在迷信顽固、民智未开的时代，常规劝诫无效，其非常手段是必要之恶，且后续以建设替代破坏，可部分抵消手段之非议。

**Q6: Quote Meaning & Fairness**  
- **Meaning**: 引用古语对比三位官员的治理效果：子产（郑国）使民“不敢欺”（畏法），子贱（单父）使民“不忍欺”（怀德），西门豹（邺）使民“不敢欺”（畏其威）。提问三者谁最贤能，强调“辨治者”（明察治道者）应能分辨。  
- **Fairness**: **部分公平，但有局限**。  
  - 公平处：准确概括三人风格——子产重法治（威慑），子贱重德化（感召），西门豹重实绩与威权（破除陋习、兴修水利）。西门豹的“不敢欺”源于恐惧，道德境界似低于子贱的“不忍欺”。  
  - 不公处：  
    1. **忽略结果差异**：西门豹的“不敢欺”伴随 irreversible 民生改善（十二渠），其功业泽被后世，远超子产、子贱的短期治理。  
    2. **低估情境难度**：邺地积弊深重（“所从来久远”），需强力破除迷信，温和手段无效，故西门豹模式在此 context 中最有效。  
    3. **标准单一**：仅以“欺”的层次评判，未考量制度创新、经济民生等维度。  
  - **结论**：若仅论“民风感化”，子贱最贤；若论“解决根本问题、创造持久福祉”，西门豹贡献最大，其“不敢欺”实为通向“乐成”的必经阶段。评论者未充分权衡手段与长效成果，故评价不够全面。 [end of text]
