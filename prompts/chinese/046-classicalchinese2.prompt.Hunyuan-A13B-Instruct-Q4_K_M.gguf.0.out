### (1) Translation of the Story:

King Wu of Wei was discussing state affairs and was always correct in his judgments. None of his ministers could match him, and after the court session, he returned with a joyful expression. Wu Qi (a famous strategist and reformer) approached him and said, "Have you ever heard of the words of King Zhuang of Chu, which were reported to your courtiers?" King Wu of Wei replied, "What were King Zhuang of Chu's words?" Wu Qi responded, "King Zhuang of Chu was also discussing state affairs and was always correct in his judgments. None of his ministers could match him, and after the court session, he returned with a worried expression. Shen Gong Wu Chen asked him, 'Your Majesty, you have a worried expression after the court session. Why is that?' King Zhuang of Chu replied, 'When I discuss state affairs and am always correct, and none of my ministers can match me, I feel worried. This is because of the advice of Zhong Yi, who said: "The feudal lords who consider themselves worthy of learning from others will become kings, those who consider themselves worthy of making friends will become hegemons, those who consider themselves worthy of seeking advice will survive, and those who consider themselves worthy of planning but believe no one else is as capable as themselves will perish." Now, with my own unworthiness, and with no ministers able to match me, my state is nearly in danger of perishing. This is why I feel worried.' King Zhuang of Chu was worried because of this, but you, my lord, are joyful." King Wu of Wei hesitated, bowed twice, and said, "It is the will of Heaven that you, Master Wu Qi, reveal my faults."

### (2) Moral of the Story:

The moral of the story is that true leadership requires self-awareness and humility. A wise ruler does not take credit for their perfect judgment alone but recognizes the contributions of others and acknowledges their own shortcomings. King Wu of Wei initially rejoiced in his own infallibility, but Wu Qi's analogy with King Zhuang of Chu taught him the importance of humility and the dangers of complacency. A leader who fails to seek advice or underestimate others risks losing the trust and support of their ministers, ultimately endangering their state. The story emphasizes that humility and the willingness to learn from others are essential qualities for effective leadership.

### (3) Counterparts in Western (European) Thought:

Yes, the concepts in the story have counterparts in Western thought, particularly in the works of ancient Greek and Roman philosophers. For example:

- **Socrates and the Socratic Method**: Socrates emphasized humility and the pursuit of wisdom through dialogue. He believed that true wisdom lies in recognizing one's own ignorance and seeking knowledge through questioning others. This aligns with the idea of self-awareness and humility in leadership that is central to the story.

- **Plato's Republic**: In Plato's ideal state, leaders (philosopher-kings) are expected to rule with wisdom and self-mastery. They are reminded to always question their own understanding and to seek the counsel of others, reflecting the importance of humility and collective wisdom in governance.

- **Aristotle's Virtue Ethics**: Aristotle argued that virtuous leaders must cultivate the virtue of *phronesis* (practical wisdom), which involves balancing self-confidence with the ability to listen to and learn from others. This aligns with the theme of humility and the dangers of arrogance in leadership.

- **The Roman Concept of *Virtus***: In Roman thought, *virtus* referred to the qualities of a good leader, including wisdom, courage, and humility. Roman leaders like Cincinnatus exemplified the idea of putting the state above personal pride, a concept akin to King Zhuang of Chu's concern for his state's survival.

In summary, the story's emphasis on humility, self-awareness, and the dangers of complacency resonates with the philosophical traditions of ancient Greece and Rome, where effective leadership was seen as requiring both wisdom and the ability to learn from others.
