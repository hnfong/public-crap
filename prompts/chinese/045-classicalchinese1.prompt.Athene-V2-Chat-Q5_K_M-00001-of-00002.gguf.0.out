During the reign of Duke Wen of Wei, Ximen Bao became the magistrate of Ye. Upon arrival, he learned that the people were impoverished due to the annual practice of sacrificing young women to the river god, River伯 (Hebo). The local officials and witches profited from this practice. Ximen Bao cleverly exposed and punished the corrupt officials and witches by pretending to need a better bride, leading to their drowning. He then initiated a project to build irrigation channels, which eventually brought prosperity to the region.

The local officials (三老, 廷掾) and the witches (巫祝) benefited from the practice, as they collected money and kept the surplus for themselves.

### Q4: Did the protagonist use wits or force to deal with the situation? Explain (5 points)
Ximen Bao used a combination of wits and force. He cleverly devised a plan to expose the corruption by pretending to need a better bride, which led to the drowning of the corrupt officials and witches. This approach was both strategic and forceful, as it effectively ended the practice without direct confrontation.

### Q5: Was it moral for the protagonist to do so? Briefly provide views from various perspectives (10 points)
- **Utilitarian Perspective**: Ximen Bao's actions were moral as they ended a harmful practice and brought long-term benefits to the community.
- **Deontological Perspective**: The act of drowning the corrupt officials and witches might be seen as morally questionable, as it involves taking lives. However, it can be argued that the greater good justified the means.
- **Virtue Ethics**: Ximen Bao demonstrated courage, wisdom, and justice, which are virtuous qualities. His actions were aimed at protecting the innocent and promoting the common good.
- **Legal Perspective**: Ximen Bao's actions, while drastic, were within his authority as a magistrate to enforce justice and protect the people.

### Q6: At the end of 滑稽列传, it is said that: "傳曰：「子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。」三子之才能誰最賢哉？辨治者當能別之。" -- explain what it means, and whether the comment is fair. (15 points)
This passage means: "It is said that when Zichan governed Zheng, the people could not deceive him; when Zijian governed Shanfu, the people were unwilling to deceive him; when Ximen Bao governed Ye, the people did not dare to deceive him. Among these three, who was the most virtuous? Those skilled in governance can distinguish."

The comment is fair in that it highlights the unique strengths of each leader:
- **Zichan** was known for his wisdom and ability to see through deceit.
- **Zijian** was known for his moral influence, making the people unwilling to deceive him.
- **Ximen Bao** was known for his firmness and justice, making the people fear to deceive him.

Each leader had a different approach to governance, and the comment suggests that a skilled observer can appreciate the distinct virtues and effectiveness of each. The fairness lies in recognizing that different contexts may require different leadership styles, and all three were successful in their own right. [end of text]
