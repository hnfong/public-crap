### Q1: Short Summary of the Story
West Gate Bridge (Xi Men Bao) was appointed as the magistrate of Ye. He discovered that the local people were suffering because of a superstition involving the "River God" who supposedly required a bride every year. The local officials and priests exploited this belief to extort money and take young girls. Xi Men Bao cleverly exposed and ended this practice by pretending to sacrifice the priest and her assistants to the River God. He then directed the people to build irrigation canals, which initially met resistance but ultimately benefited the community. His actions made him famous and his legacy endured.

### Q2: Victims in the Story
The victims were usually young girls from poor families who were deemed beautiful. They were selected by the priests and officials to be "married" to the River God, often leading to their deaths.

### Q3: Beneficiaries of the Old Practice
The beneficiaries were the local officials (三老, 廷掾), priests (巫祝), and possibly wealthy landowners who shared the extorted money and maintained their influence over the community.

### Q4: Protagonist's Approach
Xi Men Bao used a combination of wit and psychological manipulation. He did not use physical force but instead exploited the superstitions and fears of the local officials and priests. By pretending to sacrifice them to the River God, he instilled fear and ended the harmful practice without direct violence.

### Q5: Morality of the Protagonist's Actions
- **Utilitarian Perspective**: Xi Men Bao's actions were moral because they benefited the greater good by ending a harmful practice and improving the lives of the people.
- **Deontological Perspective**: Some might argue that his actions were immoral because he deceived and terrified the officials and priests, which could be seen as manipulative and unjust.
- **Virtue Ethics Perspective**: From this viewpoint, Xi Men Bao's actions could be seen as virtuous because he acted with wisdom, courage, and a sense of justice to protect the vulnerable.
- **Consequentialist Perspective**: The long-term benefits to the community, such as improved irrigation and economic prosperity, outweigh the short-term fear and deception.

### Q6: Explanation and Fairness of the Comment
The comment compares three magistrates: Zi Chan of Zheng, Zi Jian of Shanfu, and Xi Men Bao of Ye. It suggests that:
- **Zi Chan** governed with such integrity that people couldn't deceive him.
- **Zi Jian** governed with such benevolence that people wouldn't dare to deceive him.
- **Xi Men Bao** governed with such authority that people didn't dare to deceive him.

The comment is fair in highlighting the different strengths of each magistrate. It acknowledges that each had unique qualities that made them effective in their roles, rather than ranking them in a hierarchy of virtue. It emphasizes the importance of different governance styles and the context in which they are applied. [end of text]
