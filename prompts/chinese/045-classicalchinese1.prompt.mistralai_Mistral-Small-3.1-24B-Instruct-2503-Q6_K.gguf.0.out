### Q1: Short Summary of the Story
West Gate Tao (西门豹) was appointed as the magistrate of Ye (邺). He discovered that the local people were suffering because of a superstition involving the River God (河伯) who was said to require a bride every year. The local officials and priests exploited this belief to extort money from the people. West Gate Tao cleverly exposed and ended this practice by pretending to sacrifice the priest and her assistants to the River God. He then organized the construction of irrigation canals, benefiting the people and ensuring his legacy.

### Q2: Victims in the Story
The victims were usually young, attractive girls from poor families. These girls were selected by the priests and officials to be "married" to the River God, often leading to their deaths.

### Q3: Beneficiaries of the Old Practice
The local officials (三老), clerks (廷掾), and priests (巫祝) benefited from the old practice. They extorted money from the people and shared the proceeds among themselves.

### Q4: Protagonist's Approach
West Gate Tao used a combination of wit and psychological manipulation. He pretended to participate in the ritual but then "sacrificed" the priest and her assistants to the River God, creating fear and awe among the officials and the people. This clever ruse ended the practice without resorting to direct violence against the officials.

### Q5: Morality of the Protagonist's Actions
- **Utilitarian Perspective**: West Gate Tao's actions were moral because they benefited the majority of the people by ending a harmful superstition and improving their lives through irrigation.
- **Deontological Perspective**: Some might argue that his actions were immoral because he deceived and frightened the people, and effectively killed the priest and her assistants, even if it was a ruse.
- **Virtue Ethics Perspective**: From this viewpoint, West Gate Tao's actions could be seen as moral if they align with virtues like wisdom, courage, and benevolence. He acted for the greater good and showed cleverness and bravery.
- **Legal Perspective**: In the context of the time, his actions might be seen as justified given the harm caused by the old practice and the lack of legal recourse for the people.

### Q6: Explanation and Fairness of the Comment
The comment compares three magistrates: Zi Chan (子产) of Zheng, Zi Jian (子贤) of Shanfu, and West Gate Tao of Ye. It suggests that:
- **Zi Chan**: The people could not deceive him because of his strict governance.
- **Zi Jian**: The people did not dare to deceive him because of his benevolence.
- **West Gate Tao**: The people did not dare to deceive him because of his fearsome reputation.

The comment is fair in highlighting the different strengths of each magistrate. Zi Chan's strictness, Zi Jian's benevolence, and West Gate Tao's cleverness and fearsome reputation all contributed to effective governance in their respective regions. The comment acknowledges that each had unique qualities that made them effective leaders, rather than ranking them in terms of superiority. [end of text]
