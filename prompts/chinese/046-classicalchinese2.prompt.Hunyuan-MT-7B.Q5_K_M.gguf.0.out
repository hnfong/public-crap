This is a passage from Xunzi:

Duke Wu of Wei made wise decisions in his governance, and none of his ministers could match his wisdom. After leaving the court, he looked pleased. Wu Qi then said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu mentioned by those around you?" Duke Wu asked, "What were the words of King Zhuang of Chu?" Wu Qi replied, "King Zhuang of Chu also made wise decisions in his governance, and none of his ministers could match his wisdom. However, after leaving the court, he looked worried. Shen Gong and Wu Chen approached and asked, 'Why do you look worried after a successful meeting?' King Zhuang replied, 'It is because when I make wise decisions, none of my ministers can match me, and that makes me worried. Among the teachings of my mentor, it is said: 'He who finds a teacher becomes a king, he who finds a friend becomes a hegemon, he who finds someone he can trust remains in power, and he who makes his own plans without anyone surpassing him will perish.' Now, because I am so unworthy, and none of my ministers can match my wisdom, my country is in danger of perishing. That is why I am worried.' King Zhuang of Chu was worried, yet you look pleased." Duke Wu bowed twice and said, 'Heaven has sent you to correct my mistakes.'"

(1) Translate the story into English:

Duke Wu of Wei was known for his wise decision-making, which no one in his court could surpass. Yet, after leaving the court, he appeared joyful. Wu Qi then asked, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu mentioned by those around you?" Duke Wu inquired, "What were those words?" Wu Qi explained, "King Zhuang of Chu, too, made wise decisions, but unlike Duke Wu, he looked worried after leaving the court. His advisors Shen Gong and Wu Chen asked, 'Why are you worried after a successful meeting?' King Zhuang replied, 'It is because when I make wise decisions, no one in my court can match my wisdom, and this fills me with worry. One of my mentors once said, "A lord who finds a great teacher becomes a king, a lord who finds a loyal friend becomes a hegemon, a lord who finds someone he can trust remains in power, but a lord who makes his own plans without anyone surpassing him will lose his kingdom.' Considering my own lack of merit and the fact that no one in my court can match my wisdom, my country is at risk of falling. This is why I am worried.'" King Zhuang of Chu was worried, yet you are pleased." Duke Wu bowed twice and said, "Heaven has sent you to help me correct my mistakes."

(2) Explain the moral of the story:

The moral of this story is that even a wise leader can feel anxious when they realize that no one in their court possesses the same level of wisdom or ability as they do. This highlights the importance of having trusted and capable advisors who can offer constructive criticism and support. It also emphasizes the dangers of being too confident in one's own abilities, as it can lead to overlooking potential threats to one's rule.

(3) Do the concepts in the story have a counterpart in Western (European) thought?

Yes, the concepts in this story have counterparts in Western thought. For example, the idea of a leader being surrounded by advisors who can offer honest feedback and advice is similar to the concept of "councilors" or "mentors" in many Western political systems. The idea of a leader's wisdom being surpassed by their advisors is similar to the concept of "checks and balances" or "checks on power" in democratic systems, which prevent a single person from becoming too powerful. Additionally, the idea of a leader's anxiety due to the lack of capable successors is similar to the concept of "succession crises" or "the fear of losing power" in political theory. [end of text]
