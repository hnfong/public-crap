The minister Wu Chi asked, 'Why did the king show a worried mood?' Duke Zhuang of Chu replied, 'I have planned something and it was difficult, and all the ministers could not handle it, so I am worried. In the middle of the pond, he said, 'The king himself is the one who can get a teacher to rule, a friend to dominate, and a doubt to survive. If the king himself is not able to handle his own affairs and is not better than others, then he will be destroyed.' Now, with my own lack of ability, and all the ministers unable to handle it, our country is nearly destroyed. Therefore, I am worried.' Duke Zhuang of Chu was worried, and you are happy."
