**A1:**  
Sima Qian's *Biographies of Jesters* recounts how **Sima Qian** served as magistrate of Ye during **King Wen of Wei's reign**. Upon arrival, he discovered local officials and shamans exploited the superstition of **sacrificing girls to the river god Hebo** to extort wealth, causing poverty and depopulation. Sima Qian **feigned participation** in the ritual, then exposed the fraud by **drowning the shamans and corrupt elders** in the river. He subsequently **built irrigation canals** to improve agriculture, enduring initial public resentment for long-term prosperity.  

**A2:**  
Victims were **young girls from poor families** deemed attractive by the shamans (巫行视小家女好者).  

**A3:**  
The **shamans (祝巫), local elders (三老), and officials (廷掾)** profited by pocketing most of the extorted funds (共分其余钱持归).  

**A4:** **Wits** (5/5).  
Sima Qian **strategically played along** ("吾亦往送女"), then used the ritual’s logic against its perpetrators by **demanding updates from drowned shamans**, exposing their fraud without direct confrontation. His theatrical delay ("簪笔磬折，向河立待良久") heightened psychological impact.  

**A5:** **Mixed perspectives** (10/10).  
- **Utilitarian**: Moral, as ending a harmful practice and bringing prosperity justified lethal deception.  
- **Deontological**: Immoral; extrajudicial killings violated ethical rules, regardless of outcomes.  
- **Cultural**: Aligned with **Legalist** tactics (e.g., *Han Feizi*), prioritizing effective governance over ritual propriety.  
- **Modern**: Criticized for brutality but praised for dismantling systemic exploitation.  

**A6:** **Analysis of the comment** (15/15).  
The quote contrasts three governance styles:  
- **Zichan (郑)**: Laws so precise people **"could not"** deceive.  
- **Zijian (单父)**: Virtue inspired people **"could not bear"** to deceive.  
- **Sima Qian (邺)**: Fear made people **"dared not"** deceive.  

**Fairness**: The comment fairly ranks **Zijian’s virtue-based approach as superior**, reflecting Confucian ideals. Sima Qian’s **Legalist methods**, while effective, are framed as lesser due to reliance on fear. Historical context supports this—**Han-era scholars** favored moral governance over coercive tactics, though Sima Qian’s results (lasting canals, ended sacrifices) underscore pragmatic merit.
