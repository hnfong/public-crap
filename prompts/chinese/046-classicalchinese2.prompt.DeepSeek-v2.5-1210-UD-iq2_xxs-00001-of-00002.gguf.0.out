(1) **Translation of the Story:**

In the state of Wei, Duke Wu of Wei was discussing state affairs and was successful in his strategies, with no ministers able to match his wisdom. After leaving the court, he showed a pleased expression. Wu Qi approached him and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu from your attendants?" Duke Wu replied, "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?" Wu Qi responded, "King Zhuang of Chu, when discussing state affairs and being successful in his strategies, with no ministers able to match his wisdom, showed a worried expression after leaving the court. Shen Gong Wu Chen approached and asked, 'Why do you show a worried expression after the court session?' King Zhuang replied, 'I am successful in my strategies, and no ministers can match my wisdom, which is why I am worried. In the words of Zhong Kui, it is said: "A ruler who gains a teacher will rule as a king, one who gains a friend will rule as aéœ¸, one who gains a doubter will survive, but one who schemes alone and finds no equal will perish." Now, with my incompetence, and no ministers able to match me, our state is close to perishing! This is why I am worried.' King Zhuang showed worry, while you, my lord, show joy." Duke Wu hesitated and bowed twice, saying, "Heaven has sent you to correct my faults."

(2) **Moral of the Story:**

The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should not be complacent when their abilities surpass those of their ministers. Instead, they should be concerned, as it indicates a lack of capable advisors and potential danger for the state. A ruler who is alone in their wisdom may lead the state to ruin, as they lack the counsel and support of others. The story emphasizes the importance of seeking advice and surrounding oneself with capable and wise ministers to ensure the stability and prosperity of the state.

(3) **Counterpart in Western Thought:**

The concept in the story has a counterpart in Western (European) thought, particularly in the ideas of leadership and governance that emphasize the importance of counsel and the dangers of autocracy. The idea that a ruler should seek advice and not be isolated in their wisdom is similar to the Western notion of the "Divine Right of Kings" being balanced by the need for wise counsel and the rule of law. In Western political thought, figures like Aristotle in "Politics" discuss the ideal state and the role of the ruler, emphasizing the need for a balance of power and the importance of having wise advisors. The idea of a ruler being "alone in their wisdom" leading to potential downfall is also reflected in the warnings against autocracy and the importance of a balanced political structure, as seen in the works of Machiavelli and other political theorists.
