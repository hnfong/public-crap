### (1) Translation of the Story into English:

The King of Wei was plotting schemes during the court session, and none of his ministers could catch him. After the court session, he returned with a look of satisfaction. Wu Qi (a famous statesman in ancient China) said, "Have you heard of the words of King Zhuang of Chu spoken by your ministers?" The King of Wei replied, "What were the words of King Zhuang of Chu?" Wu Qi responded, "When King Zhuang of Chu was plotting schemes during the court session, none of his ministers could catch him. After the court session, he returned with a look of concern. Lord Shen and Minister Wu went forward and asked, 'Why do we have a look of concern?' King Zhuang of Chu said, 'I am plotting schemes during the court session, and none of my ministers can catch me. This is why I feel concerned. The advice from the sage in the middle, which said, "Those who consider themselves teachers are kings, those who gain friends are emperors, those who are doubtful are preserved, and those who plot schemes without thinking about themselves will perish," is why I feel concerned. Now, with unqualified individuals like me plotting schemes and none of my ministers can catch me, is our country on the verge of collapse? This is why I feel concerned.'" King Zhuang of Chu felt concerned, while the King of Wei felt pleased. The King of Wei bowed again and said, "Heavenly Master, you have corrected our mistakes."

### (2) Moral of the Story:

The moral of this story is about the dangers of relying on unqualified individuals to make important decisions or lead a country. The King of Wei sought to exploit his ministers' incompetence to plot schemes, thinking he would gain pleasure from their inability to stop him. However, Wu Qi, who had studied the example of King Zhuang of Chu, pointed out that such behavior would lead to the downfall of the country. King Zhuang of Chu's example showed that even the most capable ruler must be cautious and avoid making decisions based on the advice of unqualified individuals. The moral teaches that leaders should be discerning and avoid being swayed by those who lack expertise or judgment.

### (3) Counterpart in Western Thought:

The concepts in this story do have counterparts in Western thought, particularly in the works of philosophers like **Socrates**, **Plato**, and **Aristotle**. 

- **Socrates**: In Plato's dialogues, Socrates often critiques those who rely on unqualified individuals or rely on rhetoric without substance. For example, in *The Republic*, Socrates discusses the importance of a wise and virtuous leader who is not easily influenced by others. He emphasizes the need for a leader to think critically and make decisions based on their own judgment rather than the advice of others.

- **Plato**: In *The Republic*, Plato argues that a good ruler must be wise, just, and virtuous. He warns against the dangers of relying on unqualified individuals, as they may lack the necessary wisdom and moral character to lead effectively. Plato also discusses the importance of education and the cultivation of virtue in leaders.

- **Aristotle**: Aristotle, in his work *Politics*, emphasizes the importance of a leader who is virtuous and has the necessary knowledge and experience to govern effectively. He critiques those who rely on unqualified individuals or act impulsively without considering the long-term consequences of their actions.

In summary, the moral of the story aligns with the Western philosophical emphasis on the importance of a wise and virtuous leader who is not easily influenced by others.
