### (1) Translation of the Story into English:

The King of Wei was plotting schemes and acting opportunistically, but none of his ministers could catch him. After returning from court, he was overjoyed. Wu Qi, a loyal minister, said to the king, "Have you heard of the words of King Zhuang of Chu? They circulated among your ministers, right?" The King of Wei asked, "What were the words of King Zhuang of Chu?" Wu Qi replied, "King Zhuang of Chu was plotting schemes and acting opportunistically, but none of his ministers could catch him. After returning from court, he was overjoyed. Lord Shen and his ministers asked, 'Why is the king overjoyed?' King Zhuang of Chu said, 'He is not a good ruler, but his ministers cannot catch him. This is why he is overjoyed. Among them, there is a man named Yu, who said, 'Those who consider themselves teachers are kings, those who consider themselves friends are emperors, those who are doubtful are cautious, and those who plot schemes without thinking for themselves will perish.' Now, with a ruler as unqualified as Yu, and his ministers unable to catch him, is our country at risk of collapse? This is why he is overjoyed.'" The King of Chu was overjoyed, and the King of Wei was overjoyed too. The King of Wei bowed again and said, "Heavenly Father, you have corrected our mistakes."

### (2) Moral of the Story:

The moral of the story is about the dangers of arrogance, self-centeredness, and the pursuit of personal gain without considering the well-being of others. The King of Wei, who was overjoyed at his own success, failed to recognize the potential dangers of his actions. Similarly, the King of Chu, who was overjoyed at his own success, underestimated the importance of humility and the need to consider the actions of others. Both rulers were blinded by their own arrogance and failed to see the broader implications of their decisions. The story serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of hubris and the importance of humility, self-reflection, and considering the impact of one's actions on others.

### (3) Counterpart in Western Thought:

The concepts in the story do have counterparts in Western thought, particularly in the works of philosophers like **Socrates**, **Plato**, and **Confucius**.

1. **Socrates**: Socrates emphasized the importance of self-reflection and the pursuit of wisdom. In Plato's *Phaedo*, Socrates discusses the dangers of arrogance and the importance of humility. He warns that those who are overly confident in their own knowledge and actions are at risk of making mistakes that harm others.

2. **Plato**: In *The Republic*, Plato explores the idea of the "ruling philosopher," who is guided by wisdom and considers the well-being of others. He contrasts this with the "ruling tyrant," who is driven by personal ambition and self-interest. The story of the King of Wei and the King of Chu parallels the idea of a ruler who becomes complacent and self-centered, leading to their downfall.

3. **Confucius**: Confucius emphasized the importance of humility, filial piety, and the care of others. In his teachings, he stressed the idea that a ruler must consider the needs of the people and act in their best interest. He also warned against arrogance and the dangers of acting without regard for others.

In summary, the moral and themes of the story resonate with Western philosophical ideas about humility, self-reflection, and the importance of considering the impact of one's actions on others.
