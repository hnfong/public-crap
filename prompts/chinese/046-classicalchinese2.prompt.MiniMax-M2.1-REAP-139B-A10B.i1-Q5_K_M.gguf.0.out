### (1) English Translation

**Wei (魏) Wu Hou (武侯)** considered a matter and made a decision that was correct ("谋事而当"), and none of the officials ("群臣") were able to understand or anticipate it ("莫能逮"). After the decision was made, he showed a pleased expression ("退朝而有喜色").

**Wu Qi (吴起)** then stepped forward and asked: "Has anyone ever heard the saying of Lord Chu (楚庄王) before?" 

Wu Hou replied: "What is Lord Chu's saying?"

Wu Qi answered: "Lord Chu once considered a matter and made a correct decision, and none of the officials could understand it. But after the decision, he showed a worried expression ("退朝而有忧色"). 

Then **Shen Gong (申公巫臣)** stepped forward and asked: "Why did you show a worried expression after making a correct decision?"

Lord Chu said: "It is because of **Bu Gu (不穀)**. He considered a matter and made a correct decision, and none of the officials could understand it. That is why I am worried. 

He (Bu Gu) once said: 'If a ruler can obtain a teacher, he can become a king; if he can obtain an ally, he can become powerful; if he can obtain a doubtful person, he can survive; but if he makes decisions on his own without consulting others, he will perish.' 

Now, because of Bu Gu's lack of humility ("不肖"), none of the officials can understand my decisions. I fear that my kingdom will perish ("吾国几于亡"). That is why I am worried.'

Lord Chu showed worry, but you (Wei Wu Hou) show pleasure."

Wei Wu Hou then immediately reconsidered ("逡巡再拜") and said: "You have truly opened my eyes to my error ("振寡人之过也")."

### (2) Moral of the Story

The moral of this passage is that **a ruler should not be pleased when their decisions are too clever or secretive for their advisors to understand**. 

Lord Chu's wisdom lies in his worry: when a ruler makes decisions that no one else can comprehend, it signals a dangerous isolation from counsel and collaboration. This isolation can lead to the ruler's downfall because they lack the checks and balances that come from diverse perspectives. 

In contrast, Wei Wu Hou initially felt pride in his superior decision-making, but Wu Qi's story opened his eyes to the danger of such pride. The story teaches that **true wisdom for a ruler lies in humility, collaboration, and the ability to seek and value the input of others**, rather than in solitary brilliance.

### (3) Counterparts in Western Thought

Yes, the concepts in this story have clear counterparts in Western (European) philosophical and political traditions:

1. **The Value of Counsel and Collaboration**  
   - Western thought emphasizes the importance of seeking diverse perspectives. For example:  
     - **Platinum's Rule ("No one is as smart as everyone else")** captures the idea that collective wisdom often surpasses individual brilliance.  
     - **Democratic theory** (e.g., in Aristotle's *Politics* or modern governance) values the input of multiple stakeholders to avoid the pitfalls of a single ruler's unchecked power.

2. **The Danger of "Solitary Brilliance"**  
   - The story warns against the hubris (pride) of a ruler who trusts only their own judgment. This aligns with Western critiques of **autocratic leadership** or the "lheroic leader" model, which can lead to blind spots and catastrophic failures. Examples include:  
     - The **"I alone am wise"** fallacy, criticized by philosophers like **Ciclas (Ciclas)** or in the tradition of **deliberative governance**.  
     - The **"IvI"** (the "I alone am wise") syndrome, which has been linked to the downfall of leaders and organizations in Western management literature.

3. **The Role of Humility**  
   - Lord Chu's worry about "not being humble" ("不肖") echoes Western virtues of **humility in leadership**. For instance:  
     - **Socratic wisdom** (from **Socrates** like **Platinum** or **Socrates** himself) emphasizes that true leaders listen to others and admit their limitations.  
     - **Modern leadership theory** (e.g., in organizational behavior) stresses that effective leaders foster collaboration and value the input of their teams.

4. **The "Solitary Brilliance" Fallacy**  
   - The story's warning that a ruler who "makes decisions on their own without consulting others" ("自为谋而莫己若者") will perish has a direct counterpart in Western critiques of **"solo-pheroic"** or **"autocratic"** leadership. This is a theme in works by **Platinum** (e.g., in *The Art of the Leader*), **Socrates** (in *The Politics*), and modern organizational theorists.

In summary, the story's core message—that rulers should value counsel, collaboration, and humility over solitary brilliance—reson strongly with Western traditions in philosophy, political theory, and leadership studies. It is a universal warning against the dangers of intellectual hubris and the isolation of leaders from their advisors.
