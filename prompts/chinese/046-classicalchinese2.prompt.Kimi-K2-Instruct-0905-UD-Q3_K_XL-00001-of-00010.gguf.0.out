(1) English translation

Marquis Wu of Wei had just settled some state business flawlessly; none of his ministers could match his plan. When the audience ended he walked out looking pleased. Wu Qi stepped forward and said:  
“Has Your Lordship ever heard, from any of your attendants, the words of King Zhuang of Chu?”  
The Marquis asked: “What did King Zhuang say?”  
Wu Qi answered:  
“King Zhuang of Chu once settled a matter flawlessly, and none of his ministers could equal him. When he left court he looked worried. Shen Gong Wu-chen came forward and asked:  
‘Your Majesty leaves court wearing a look of sorrow—why?’  
The King replied:  
‘I planned successfully and none of my ministers could rival me. That is why I am anxious. The Zhong-lu maxim says:  
“A feudal lord who can obtain men to be his teachers will become a true king; one who can obtain men to be his friends will become a hegemon; one who can obtain men to question and correct him will survive; one who plans everything himself and finds no one his equal will perish.”  
Now, worthless as I am, if my whole court cannot match me, my state is close to extinction!’  
Thus King Zhuang was anxious, whereas Your Lordship is delighted.”  
Marquis Wu drew back, bowed twice and said:  
“Heaven has sent you, Master, to rouse me to my fault.”

(2) Moral of the story

A ruler (or any leader) should worry, not rejoice, when he has no one around him who can challenge, improve or surpass his ideas. The moment the court becomes a chorus of inferiors, the state is already sliding toward ruin. True security lies in having advisers who are at least equal—and preferably better—than oneself.

The thought is instantly recognizable in European political wisdom:

- “The greatest tyranny is the rule of a master over slaves who dare not contradict him.”  
  – Aristotle, Politics 1285a.

- “I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing: that I know nothing.”  
  – Socrates in Plato’s Apology; the dialectical life depends on finding people who can refute you.

- Machiavelli warns the prince to surround himself with candid counselors and to reward truth-tellers, for flatterers are “the plague of courts.”

- In modern form it is the rationale for collective cabinet government and for the slogan that a chief executive needs “people who can look him in the eye and tell him he is wrong.” [end of text]
