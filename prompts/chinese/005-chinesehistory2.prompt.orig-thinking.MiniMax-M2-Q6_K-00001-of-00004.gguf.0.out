I need to keep the response concise, under 1000 characters, focusing on the reasons for the fall of the Han dynasty. I’ll outline key points like the centralization of power, the rise of warlords, and the impact of the Yellow Turban Rebellion. I’ll also mention the role of the eunuchs, the decline of the aristocracy, and the economic issues like heavy taxation and inflation. I want to ensure I cover both the Western and Eastern Han periods effectively.

### 概述
汉朝亡于外戚宦官专权、豪强兼并与财政崩溃叠加，致中央失能、军政分离，终以黄巾起义与董卓入京为导火索，三国分裂。

### 原因
- 权力失衡：外戚与宦官轮替专权，党锢之祸排斥士人，官僚体系失能。
- 豪强兼并：土地集中、奴役化，赋役转嫁小农，税源枯竭。
- 财政货币危机：铸钱失控、通胀与货币贬值，财政失衡。
- 军政分离：边郡军权外移，州郡豪强化，中央无兵可用。
- 社会动荡：黄巾起义与羌乱频仍，消耗国力。
- 关键事件：董卓废立、迁都洛阳，皇室权威崩塌；群雄并起，三国形成。 [end of text]
