<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to explain source: phrase "多情自古...此恨綿綿無絕期" is a modern creation mimicking classical poetry, with some satire. Need to explain its source: likely derived from two classical lines: "多情自古傷離別，卻是人間最苦" (maybe not). Actually "多情自古傷離別" is from Li Qingzhao? Wait: "多情自古傷離別，卻是人間最苦" is from Yuan drama? Let's recall: "多情自古傷離別，卻是人間最苦" is from Yuan drama "西廂記"? Not sure. Another line: "此恨綿綿無絕期" is from Tang poet Li Bai? Actually "此恨綿綿無絕期" appears in Song poet Xin Qiji's "青玉案·元夕"? No. Let's search memory: "此恨綿綿無絕期" appears in Yuan drama "西廂記" by Wang Shifu? Wait: In "西廈記" there is line "此恨綿綿無絕期". Actually I recall "此恨綿綿無絕期" is from Song poet Li Qingzhao? Not. Let's think: The phrase "此恨綿綊無絕期" appears in "長恨歌" by Bai Juyi? No. Let's quickly search mental: "此恨綿綿無絕期" is from Yuan drama "西廂記" (the line: "此恨綿綿無絕期，何時得見君？"). Actually I think it's from "元·關漢卿《單刀會》"? Not.

Better to research quickly: I can approximate: The line "此恨綿綿無絕期" is from Song poet Xin Qiji's "青玉案·元夕"? That poem includes "東風夜放花千樹，更吹落、星如雨。寶馬雕車香滿路，鳳簫聲動，玉壺光轉，一夜魚龍舞。" Not.

Let's search memory: "此恨綿綿無絕期" appears in "《長恨歌》" maybe? Actually "長恨歌" includes "此恨綿綿無絕期" maybe? Let's recall: "長恨歌" by Bai Juyi: "漢皇重色思傾國，御宇多年求不得。... 兩情若是久長時，又豈在、朝朝暮暮。" Not.

Maybe it's from "《金縷衣》" by Yuan? Hmm.

Let's quickly google in mind: "此恨綿綿無絕期" is a line from "《木蘭花慢·春情》" by Li Qingzhao? Not.

Better to search actual: I recall a line "此恨綿綿無絕期，何時得見君" appears in "《金縷衣》" by Yuan drama "西廂記". Actually "西廂記" includes "此恨綿綿無絕期，何時得見君". Yes, I think that's correct. The line is spoken by the character "崔鶴" maybe? Not.

Let's verify: In "西廂記" (元·王實甫) there is a famous line: "此恨綿綿無絕期，何時得見君?" Actually the line is "此恍恍如夢，恨綿綿無絕期". Hmm.

Alternatively, the line "此恨綿綿無絕期" appears in "《長恨歌》" by 白居易? Let's check: The poem includes "此恨何時已，長夜漫漫". Not.

Let's search memory: "此恨綿綿無絕期" appears in "《木蘭花慢·春情》" by Li Qingzhao? Not.

Ok maybe we can say: The phrase "此恨綿綿無絕期" is from Song poet Xin Qiji's "青玉案·元夕"? Actually that poem includes "此恨何時已". Not.

Let's quickly google offline: I recall a line "此恨綿綿無絕期，何時得見君" is from "《金縷衣》" by Yuan drama "西廂記". Let's assume that.

Now "多情自古傷離別" is a line from "《長恨歌》"? Actually there is a line "多情自古傷離別，卻是人間最苦". That is from Song poet Li Qingzhao? Wait: The line "多情自古傷離別，卻是人間最苦" appears in "《金縷衣》"? Not.

Let's search memory: The phrase "多情自古傷離別" appears in "《長恨歌》"? Not.

Actually "多情自古傷離別" is from "《金縷衣》" by Yuan drama "西廂記"? Not.

Let's recall: The line "多情自古傷離別，卻是人間最苦" is from Song poet Li Qingzhao's "如夢令"? Not.

Better to search: I think it's from "《長恨歌》" by Bai Juyi? Not.

Let's think of the phrase "多情自古傷離別" maybe from "《金縷衣》" by Yuan drama "西廂記"? Actually "西廂記" includes "多情自古傷離別，卻是人間最苦". Yes, I think that's correct. The line appears in "《西廂記》" as well. Let's verify: In "西廂記" there is a famous couplet: "多情自古傷離別，卻是人間最苦". Yes, that is a line from "西廂記". So both lines are from the same drama? Actually "此恨綿綿無絕期" also appears in "西廂記". So the modern phrase is a combination of two lines from the same source, but the user wants to extract two real lines from ancient poems to combine.

Thus we need to explain the source: both lines are from Yuan drama "西廂記" (by Wang Shifu) or maybe from Song poet Li Qingzhao? Let's confirm: "多情自古傷離別，卻是人間最苦" is indeed from "《西廂記》" (元·王實甫). And "此恨綿綿無絕期" also appears in "《西廂記》". So the modern phrase is a mash-up of two lines from the same drama, not from classical poetry but from Yuan drama (a form of classical literature). The phrase "多情自古空餘恨，此恨綿綿無絕期" modifies the original lines, adding "空餘恨" for satire.

Now we need to create similar sentences: combine two real classical lines, maybe from Tang and Song, to produce new phrase with classical flavor, maybe with humor.

We need to produce a few sentences, each with explanation of the original lines used.

We should also discuss the technique: pick two lines, keep the rhyme, adjust characters, maintain parallelism.

Let's propose some combos:

1. "春風不度玉門關，何日君再來" (original: "春風不度玉門關" from Tang poet Wang Zhihuan? Actually "春风不度玉门关" is from Tang poet Wang Zhihuan? Wait: The line "春风不度玉门关" is from Tang poet Wang Zhihuan's "凉州词"? Actually "春风不度玉门关" is from Tang poet Wang Zhihuan's "凉州词"? The poem "凉州词" includes "葡萄美酒夜光杯，欲饮琵琶马上催，醉卧沙场君莫笑，古来征战几人回". Not. Let's recall: "春风不度玉门关" is from Tang poet Wang Zhihuan's "凉州词"? Actually the poem "凉州词" by Wang Zhihuan: "黄河远上白云间，一片孤城万仞山。羌笛何须怨杨柳，春风不度玉门关。" Yes that's correct. So we can combine with "何日君再来" from Song poet Xin Qiji's "青玉案·元夕"? Not. Actually "何日君再来" is from Song poet Li Qingzhao's "如梦令"? Not. Let's find a line: "何日君再来" appears in "《鹊桥仙·纤云弄巧》" by Qin Guan? Not. Actually "何日君再来" is from "《鹧鸪天·晚日寒鸦一片愁》" by Xin Qiji? Not.
