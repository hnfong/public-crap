**Biographies of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang**

Zhang Tingwei Shizhi was from Du Yang. His courtesy name was Jie. He had an elder brother, Zhong, with whom he lived together. He was appointed as a Cavalry Attendant with a salary of 1000 cash. He served Emperor Xiaowen for ten years without being promoted or gaining recognition. Shizhi said, "I have been serving for a long time, and my brother's property has diminished. I wish to resign and return home." The Colonel-General Yuan Ang, knowing Shizhi's worth and regretting his departure, requested to transfer Shizhi to serve as an Escort. After completing his morning duties, Shizhi spoke of matters of convenience. Emperor Xiaowen said, "Do not speak too loftily; speak of things that can be implemented today." Shizhi then spoke at length about the differences between the Qin and Han dynasties, explaining why Qin fell and Han rose. Emperor Xiaowen praised him, and Shizhi was appointed as Escort Commandant.

Shizhi accompanied the emperor on a tour, ascending the Tiger Cage. The Emperor asked the Keeper of the Imperial Park about the records of various birds and beasts. After more than ten questions, the Keeper looked around helplessly and could not answer. A Keeper of the Tiger Cage from the side answered the Emperor's questions about the records of birds and beasts in detail, intending to show his ability to respond eloquently. Emperor Xiaowen said, "Should officials be like this? The Keeper is worthless!" He then ordered Shizhi to appoint the Keeper of the Tiger Cage as the Superintendent of the Imperial Park. Shizhi, after some time, spoke up, saying, "Your Majesty, how do you regard Prince Zhuang of Jizhou?" The Emperor replied, "He is a gentleman." Shizhi then asked about Prince Xiangru of Dongyang. The Emperor again replied, "He is a gentleman." Shizhi said, "If Prince Zhuang and Prince Xiangru are considered gentlemen, yet they cannot speak out, how could this Keeper of the Tiger Cage, who is so eloquent and quick-witted, be compared to them? Moreover, Qin relied on officials skilled in writing, who competed in being overly meticulous and strict, resulting in mere formalities without genuine compassion. Thus, their faults were not heard, leading to decline and the fall of the Second Emperor, causing the collapse of the empire. Now, Your Majesty promotes this Keeper of the Tiger Cage for his eloquence, I fear that the people will follow the wind, competing in eloquence without substance. Moreover, the lower ranks will quickly imitate the upper ranks, like echoes. Decisions should be made carefully." Emperor Xiaowen said, "Well said." He then decided not to appoint the Keeper of the Tiger Cage.

The Emperor got into his carriage and called Shizhi to ride with him, proceeding slowly. He asked Shizhi about the flaws of Qin. Shizhi spoke frankly. Upon reaching the palace, the Emperor appointed Shizhi as the Superintendent of the Imperial Chariots.

Not long after, the Crown Prince and Prince of Liang entered the court together without dismounting at the Commander's Gate. Shizhi stopped them and reported that they did not show respect by not dismounting at the public gate. He then formally accused them. When Empress Dowager Bo heard of this, Emperor Xiaowen removed his cap and apologized, saying, "I did not teach my son well." Empress Dowager Bo then sent a messenger to pardon the Crown Prince and Prince of Liang, allowing them to enter. From then on, Emperor Xiaowen admired Shizhi and appointed him as a Grandee.

Not long after, Shizhi was promoted to Colonel-General. While traveling, they stopped at Baling, where Shizhi stayed north of the latrine. At that time, Consort Shen was present. The Emperor pointed to the road to Xinfeng and said, "This is the road to Handan." He ordered Consort Shen to play the zither, and he himself sang while leaning on the zither. His expression was somber and melancholic. Turning to his officials, he said, "Alas! If we use stones from the Northern Mountains to make a coffin, wrap it with hemp cloth, and fill it with lacquer, how could it be moved?" The officials all said, "Well said." Shizhi stepped forward and said, "If there is something desirable inside, even if it is buried under the Southern Mountains, it will be dug out; if there is nothing desirable inside, even without a stone coffin, what is there to grieve about?" Emperor Xiaowen praised him. Later, Shizhi was appointed as the Chief Censor.

Not long after, while the Emperor was traveling and crossing the Middle Wei Bridge, a man ran out from under the bridge, startling the imperial horses. The Emperor ordered the cavalry to capture him and bring him to the Chief Censor. Shizhi interrogated him, and the man said, "I am a local villager who heard the imperial procession and hid under the bridge. After a while, I thought the procession had passed, so I came out. When I saw the imperial carriage and cavalry, I ran." According to the law, a single person who obstructed the procession should be fined. Emperor Xiaowen was angry and said, "This man startled my horse. If my horse had not been gentle, it would have been injured. How can the Chief Censor only fine him?" Shizhi said, "The law is something the Emperor shares with the people. If the law is like this and we add to it, then the law is not trusted by the people. Moreover, at that time, if the Emperor had ordered his execution, it would have been done. Now that it has been brought to the Chief Censor, the Chief Censor is the balance of the empire. If it is tilted, then the laws of the empire will all be light or heavy. How can the people know where to place their hands and feet? I ask Your Majesty to consider it." After a while, the Emperor said, "The Chief Censor is correct."

Later, someone stole a jade ring from the front of the High Ancestral Temple. When caught, Emperor Xiaowen was furious and ordered the Chief Censor to investigate. Shizhi, according to the law, should report that stealing from the ancestral temple should be executed. Emperor Xiaowen was very angry and said, "People are so disrespectful that they steal from the temple of the former emperor. I wanted to bring this to the Chief Censor to execute, but you report it according to the law. This is not what I intended to honor the ancestral temple." Shizhi removed his cap and knelt, apologizing, saying, "The law is sufficient. Moreover, the crimes are equal, but they are distinguished by loyalty and rebellion. Now, if we execute someone for stealing from the ancestral temple, what if a foolish commoner takes a handful of soil from Mount Liang? What law would you apply to him?" After some time, Emperor Xiaowen discussed it with Empress Dowager Bo and agreed with the Chief Censor. At that time, the Chief of the Guards, Marquis Zhao, and the King of Liang, Marquis Wang Tian, both admired Shizhi's fair judgment and became close friends. From then on, Zhang Tingwei was praised throughout the empire.

After Emperor Xiaowen died and Emperor Jing ascended the throne, Shizhi was afraid and pretended to be ill, wanting to resign but fearing severe punishment. He followed Wang Sheng's advice and eventually apologized to Emperor Jing, who did not punish him.

Wang Sheng was skilled in the teachings of Huang-Lao and was a recluse. He was once summoned to the court, where all the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers gathered. Wang Sheng, an old man, said, "My shoe strings are untied." He asked Zhang Tingwei to tie them for him. After Zhang Tingwei knelt and tied them, someone told Wang Sheng, "Why do you humiliate Zhang Tingwei in the court, making him kneel to tie your shoe strings?" Wang Sheng replied, "I am old and lowly, and I know I cannot benefit Zhang Tingwei. Zhang Tingwei is currently a renowned official in the empire, so I humiliated him to make him kneel and tie my shoe strings, to honor him." The officials heard this and respected Wang Sheng even more, while also respecting Zhang Tingwei.

Zhang Tingwei served Emperor Jing for several years before being appointed as the Chancellor of the Prince of Huainan, still remembered for his past mistakes. After some time, Shizhi died. His son, Zhang Zhi, whose courtesy name was Changgong, served as a Grandee but resigned. He did not seek office again because he could not please the times.

Feng Tang's great-grandfather was from Zhao, his father moved to Dai, and during the Han dynasty, they moved to Anling. Tang was known for his filial piety and served as the Chief of the Central Guards. When Emperor Xiaowen passed by, he asked Tang, "How did your father become a guard? Where is your family?" Tang answered truthfully. The Emperor said, "When I was in Dai, my Food Supervisor, Gao Qu, often told me about the virtuous General Li Qi of Zhao, who fought at Jiuqu. Now, whenever I eat, I cannot help but think of Jiuqu. Does your father know about this?" Tang replied, "Not as much as Li Guangbi and Li Mu." The Emperor asked, "Why?" Tang said, "My great-grandfather was a military officer in Zhao who knew Li Mu well. My father was the Chancellor of Dai and knew the Zhao General Li Qi well." The Emperor, having heard about Li Guangbi and Li Mu, was pleased and slapped his thigh, saying, "Alas! If only I had Li Guangbi and Li Mu as my generals when I was young, I would not worry about the Xiongnu." Tang said, "Your Majesty, even if you had Li Guangbi and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them." The Emperor was angry and went into the palace. After some time, he called Tang and scolded him, saying, "Why do you humiliate me in front of everyone, without any respect?" Tang apologized, saying, "I am a simple man and do not know the taboos."

At that time, the Xiongnu had recently invaded Jiuquan, killing the North District Governor Qiang. The Emperor was concerned about the Xiongnu and again asked Tang, "Why do you say I cannot use Li Guangbi and Li Mu?" Tang replied, "I have heard that in ancient times, when kings sent generals, they would kneel and push the chariot, saying, 'Within the command post, it is the king's command; outside the command post, it is the general's command.' Military achievements and rewards were all decided outside and reported back. This is not an empty statement. My great-grandfather said that Li Mu, as the general of Zhao, stationed on the border, used the market taxes of the army to reward the soldiers, and rewards and punishments were decided outside without interference from the center. Entrusting and demanding success, Li Mu was able to use all his wisdom and ability, sending selected chariots of 1,300, cavalry of 13,000, and 100,000 soldiers worth 1,000 gold each. He drove the Xiongnu away, defeated the Eastern Hu, destroyed Danlin, suppressed the powerful Qin in the west, and supported Han and Wei in the south. At that time, Zhao was close to hegemony. Later, when King Zhaoxian ascended the throne, his mother was a courtesan. King Zhaoxian, after ascending the throne, followed the slander of Guo Kai and executed Li Mu, appointing Yan Jiu in his place. As a result, the army was defeated, and the soldiers fled north, and Zhao was captured and destroyed by Qin. Now, I have heard that Wei Shang, as the governor of Yunzhong, used all the market taxes of the army to reward the soldiers, and privately raised funds, slaughtering a cow every five days to entertain guests, officials, and clerks. This is why the Xiongnu avoid Yunzhong's border. When the Xiongnu once entered, Shang led chariots and cavalry to attack them, killing many of their people. The soldiers are all sons of farmers who have been conscripted into the army. How can they know the military regulations and formations? They fight all day, cutting off heads and capturing enemies, but when they report their achievements, there is no correspondence. The clerks use the law to punish them. The rewards are not given, and the officials strictly enforce the law. I, in my ignorance, think that Your Majesty's laws are too clear, rewards too light, and punishments too heavy. Moreover, Wei Shang, as the governor of Yunzhong, was demoted six ranks for his achievements, and Your Majesty, in anger, stripped him of his rank and punished him. From this, I say that even if Your Majesty had Li Guangbi and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them. I, in my ignorance, have offended the taboos and am guilty." Emperor Xiaowen was pleased. On that day, he ordered Feng Tang to pardon Wei Shang, restore him as the governor of Yunzhong, and appointed Tang as the Chief of the Cavalry, in charge of the Guards and the chariots of the provinces.

Seven years later, Emperor Jing ascended the throne and appointed Tang as the Chancellor of Chu, but he resigned. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne, he sought worthy men and recommended Feng Tang. At that time, Tang was over ninety and could no longer serve as an official, so he recommended his son Feng Shu to be a clerk. Shu, whose courtesy name was Wangsun, was also an extraordinary man and was friends with me.

Sima Qian said: Zhang Jie's words about gentlemen, maintaining the law without yielding to personal desires; Feng Gong's discussion of generals, truly profound! Truly profound! It is said, "If you do not know a person, look at his friends." The two gentlemen's praises can be inscribed in the halls of the court. The Book of Documents says, "Not biased, not partial, the royal way is vast and open; not partial, not biased, the royal way is smooth and easy." Zhang Jie and Feng Gong were close to this.
