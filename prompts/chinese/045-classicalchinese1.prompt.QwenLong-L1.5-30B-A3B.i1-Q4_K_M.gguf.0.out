Okay, let me tackle this set of questions about the "滑稽列传" story of Ximen Bao. First, I need to make sure I understand the text properly. The story is about Ximen Bao, a magistrate in the time of King Wen of Wei, who deals with the local practice of sacrificing girls to the river god, Hebo.

Starting with Q1: a short summary. The key points are that Ximen Bao investigates the problem of河伯娶妇 (sacrificing girls to Hebo), discovers it's a scam by the local officials and shamans who collect money, then outwits them by having the shamans thrown into the river, stopping the practice, and later building irrigation canals that benefit the people. I need to condense that into a concise summary, hitting the main events without too much detail.

Q2 asks about the kind of women usually victims. The text says "小家女好者" which means girls from poor families who are considered beautiful. So the victims are poor girls who are deemed beautiful. The answer should be "poor families' beautiful girls" or something similar.

Q3: Who benefited from the old practice? The text mentions 三老、廷掾 (local officials) and 巫祝 (shamans) who collected money, kept most of it, and only used a portion for the sacrifice. So the beneficiaries are the local officials and shamans.

Q4: Did the protagonist use wits or force? Ximen Bao pretends to go along with the ritual but then has the shamans thrown into the river. It's a clever trick, using the ritual itself against the perpetrators. So it's wits, not force. I need to explain how he used the existing belief system to expose the fraud without direct violence, though he did use force against the shamans, but the main method was cleverness.

Q5: Was it moral? This requires multiple perspectives. From a utilitarian view, stopping the sacrifice and building irrigation helped the people, so it's moral. From a deontological view, deceiving the people might be wrong, but the deception was to stop a greater evil. Religious perspective: the sacrifice was a superstition, so ending it was moral. But some might argue that using deception is unethical. Need to cover these angles concisely.

Q6: The quote at the end compares Ximen Bao to Zi Chan and Zi Jian. The comment says that Zi Chan wasn't deceived by the people, Zi Jian wasn't deceived because people felt compassion, and Ximen Bao made people不敢欺 (dared not deceive him). The question is whether this comparison is fair. I need to explain the meaning of the quote and then evaluate if it's fair. The text shows Ximen Bao's effectiveness through both wisdom and sternness, so the comparison might be fair, but maybe Zi Jian's approach was more about moral influence, while Ximen Bao used more direct action. The comment says "辨治者當能別之" meaning discerning administrators can tell the difference. So the fairness depends on whether the three methods are equally valid. The story shows Ximen Bao's success, so the comment is fair in that he was effective, but the comparison might be oversimplifying the different approaches.

Wait, let me double-check the text. The quote says "子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺." So Zi Chan made people unable to deceive him (because he was shrewd), Zi Jian made people not want to deceive him (because of their moral feelings), and Ximen Bao made people不敢欺 (dared not deceive him, due to fear). The comment is asking who is the most virtuous. The story of Ximen Bao shows he used a mix of wisdom and force, which led to lasting benefits. The fairness of the comment would depend on whether the three approaches are being judged on the same criteria. The text says Ximen Bao's legacy lasted, so the comment is fair in recognizing his effectiveness, but maybe the comparison is valid as each represents a different governance style.

Now, making sure all answers are concise as per the instructions. Let me check each question again.

Q1: Summary should be 5 points. So maybe list 5 key points: 1. Ximen Bao investigates the河伯娶妇 practice. 2. Discovers it's a scam by officials and shamans. 3. Uses a ruse to expose and stop the practice by throwing shamans into the river. 4. Builds irrigation canals for agriculture. 5. Ends up being remembered as a贤大夫 (virtuous official).

Q2: Victims were poor families' beautiful girls. The text says "小家女好者" so "girls from poor families who are considered beautiful."

Q3: Beneficiaries are 三老、廷掾 and 巫祝 (local officials and shamans).

Q4: Used wits. He pretended to follow the ritual but turned it against the shamans, using their own superstition to stop the fraud. The force was part of the ruse, but the main method was cleverness.

Q5: Moral perspectives: Utilitarian (good outcome, so moral), Deontological (deception is wrong, but necessary to stop greater harm), Religious (ending superstition is moral), Critique (using deception undermines trust). Need to be brief.

Q6: The quote means that each official governed differently: Zi Chan prevented deception through shrewdness, Zi Jian through moral influence, Ximen Bao through fear. The comment is fair because each approach is effective in its own way, and Ximen Bao's legacy shows his method's success. But some might argue that the comparison overlooks the different contexts, but the text supports his effectiveness.

Wait, the question says "whether the comment is fair." So I need to say if the comparison is fair. The text ends by saying Ximen Bao's name spread widely and his benefits lasted, so the comment is fair in recognizing his effectiveness. However, the three methods are different, so the comment isn't saying one is better, just that each is effective in their way. So the comment is fair.

Let me check if I missed anything. For Q4, the answer should explain that he used wits (clever strategy) rather than brute force. The text shows he pretended to follow the ritual, then had the shamans thrown in, which was a clever move within the existing framework.

For Q5, the moral question: the protagonist's action stopped a harmful practice and built infrastructure, so from a consequentialist view, it's moral. From a virtue ethics perspective, he acted to protect the people, so moral. But some might say the deception was unethical. However, since the practice was itself a deception (the shamans were lying about the river god), Ximen Bao's deception was exposing a greater deception. So overall, it's moral.

Wait, the question says "briefly provide views from various perspectives," so I need to list a few. Maybe:

- Utilitarian: Moral, as it saved lives and improved livelihoods.
- Deontological: Moral, as it eliminated a harmful practice despite deception.
- Religious: Moral, as it ended superstitious rituals.
- Critique: Immoral, as deception undermines trust in governance.

But need to be concise.

Now, making sure all answers are within the point limits. The user specified "keep your answers concise," so bullet points or very short sentences.

Let me draft the answers:

Q1: Ximen Bao, as邺令, exposed the fraudulent河伯娶妇 practice by having shamans thrown into the river, ending the scam. He then built irrigation canals, transforming agriculture and earning lasting acclaim as a virtuous official.

Q2: Poor families' beautiful girls.

Q3: Local officials (三老、廷掾) and shamans (巫祝).

Q4: Wits. Ximen Bao feigned compliance with the ritual, using the shamans' own superstition to expose their fraud by having them "deliver" the bride to Hebo, thereby stopping the practice without direct violence.

Q5: 
- Utilitarian: Moral (saved lives, improved welfare).
- Deontological: Moral (ended exploitation, deception justified).
- Religious: Moral (ended harmful superstition).
- Critique: Immoral (deception undermines governance ethics).

Q6: The quote compares three officials' governance: Zi Chan (people couldn't deceive him), Zi Jian (people wouldn't deceive him), Ximen Bao (people dared not deceive him). It's fair as each method's effectiveness is contextually valid; Ximen Bao's legacy of lasting infrastructure confirms his success, aligning with the comment.

Wait, but the question says "whether the comment is fair." So the comment is saying that each is effective in their way, and the comment is fair because Ximen Bao's approach worked well, as evidenced by the story. So the comment is fair.

Wait, the quote says "三子之才能誰最賢哉？辨治者當能別之." So it's asking who is the most virtuous, and the comment says discerning administrators can tell. The story doesn't explicitly say who's best, but the text ends by praising Ximen Bao's lasting impact. So the comment is fair in that it acknowledges different styles, but the story supports Ximen Bao's effectiveness, so the comment is fair in recognizing his success.

I think that's covered. Let me check the points again. Q6 is 15 points, so need to be thorough but concise.

Wait, the user said "keep your answers concise," so for Q6, explain the quote and then whether it's fair. The quote means that each official's governance style led to different outcomes in terms of people's behavior: Zi Chan made people unable to deceive (because he was sharp), Zi Jian made them not want to deceive (moral influence), Ximen Bao made them不敢 deceive (fear). The comment is fair because each method is valid in its context, and Ximen Bao's approach successfully ended the harmful practice and built infrastructure, so his method was effective, making the comparison fair.

Okay, that seems solid. Let me make sure all answers are correct based on the text.

Double-checking Q2: "小家女好者" – "small families' beautiful girls," so poor families' beautiful girls. Correct.

Q3: "邺三老、廷掾常岁赋敛百姓，收取其钱得数百万，用其二三十万为河伯娶妇，与祝巫共分其余钱持归." So the three elders,廷掾 (local officials), and the shamans (祝巫) shared the money. So beneficiaries are the local officials and shamans.

Q4: The answer says "wits," and explains the ruse. The text shows he used the ritual to his advantage, so it's wits, not force. The force was part of the ruse, but the main method was clever strategy.

Q5: The perspectives are covered. Need to be brief, so listing four points as above.

Q6: The explanation of the quote and the fairness. The comment is fair because it's acknowledging different governance styles, and the story shows Ximen Bao's success, so the comment is fair.

I think that's all. Now, time to write the answers concisely as per the points.
