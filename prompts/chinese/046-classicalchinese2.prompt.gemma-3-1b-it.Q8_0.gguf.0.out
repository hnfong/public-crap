Okay, let’s break down this passage from *荀子* (Suon Zi).

**(1) Translation into English:**

“Duke Wei and Duke Wu were engrossed in writing for a long time, and the ministers couldn’t press them to finish. They retreated from the palace and felt joy at this.  Wu Qu-hui asked, ‘Did he not also use the words of King Chu of楚庄 (楚庄 – a legendary historical figure known for his strategic brilliance)?  I’ve heard of his words.’ Duke Wei replied, ‘What were the words of King Chu?’  Wu Qu-hui then said, ‘King Chu sought to do things, and the ministers couldn’t press him to do them, so it was sorrow.  He said, ‘If you were to speak in the middle of the others’ words, ‘Those who are successful in their own efforts, have allies, and have doubts, then they will seek to do things and will not be as powerful as they are.  Now, with their lack of proper conduct, and the ministers couldn’t press them, then my country will surely fall.’  King Chu’s sorrowful words, and the Duke’s joy, it was sorrow.” Duke Wei hesitated and retreated from the palace, saying, ‘The angels themselves are troubled by this lack of proper conduct.’”

**(2) Explanation of the Moral of the Story:**

The core moral of this passage is about the dangers of **lack of proper conduct and the futility of attempting to force others to act when they are not properly motivated or prepared.**  Here’s a breakdown of the key takeaways:

* **The Importance of Proper Motivation:**  The Duke’s initial joy at retreating from the palace is a sign of a lack of proper motivation. He wasn’t driven by a genuine desire to achieve a beneficial outcome. He was simply seeking to avoid the discomfort of facing a difficult task.
* **The Illusion of Control:**  The Duke believes he can force his ministers to act by issuing commands. However, he fails to understand that true action stems from a deep understanding of the situation and a genuine desire to succeed.
* **The Futility of Force:**  The story illustrates that attempting to force someone to act against their will is ultimately futile.  It’s like trying to force a river to flow uphill.  The Duke’s insistence on issuing commands only exacerbates the situation.
* **The Role of Wisdom and Understanding:**  The story highlights the importance of wisdom and understanding.  King Chu’s words, though seemingly simple, reveal a profound understanding of the situation and the consequences of improper action.

**(3) Does the Concepts in the Story Have a Counterpart in Western (European) Thought?**

Absolutely. The story resonates strongly with Western thought, particularly in the following ways:

* **The Stoic Ideal of Virtue:**  The story echoes the Stoic emphasis on virtue and self-control.  The Duke’s lack of proper motivation is a direct parallel to a Stoic who would not act rashly or impulsively.  The Stoic believed that true virtue comes from inner strength and a commitment to reason.
* **The Concept of "The Ends Justify the Means":**  The Duke’s desire to avoid the discomfort of facing a difficult task is a reflection of the Western idea that sometimes, a morally questionable action is justified if it leads to a greater good.  However, this is a dangerous and ultimately flawed justification.
* **The Importance of Reason and Strategy:**  Western thought, particularly in the Enlightenment era, placed a strong emphasis on reason and strategic thinking.  The story suggests that simply issuing commands is not enough; a deeper understanding of the situation and a commitment to a well-thought-out plan are crucial.
* **The Critique of Authority:** The story also touches on the critique of unchecked authority. The Duke’s retreat is a direct response to the perceived incompetence of his ministers, highlighting the importance of questioning authority and seeking independent judgment.

**In essence, *荀子*’s story provides a powerful commentary on the dangers of unchecked ambition and the importance of cultivating virtue and wisdom.** It’s a timeless reminder that true success is not achieved through force or coercion, but through a thoughtful and reasoned approach.
