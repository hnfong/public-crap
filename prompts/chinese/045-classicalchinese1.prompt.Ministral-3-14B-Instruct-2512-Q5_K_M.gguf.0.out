### **Q5: Moral Justification – Multiple Perspectives (10 points)**

| **Perspective**       | **View**                                                                 | **Justification**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Confucian (儒家)**  | **Moral** – Upholds **righteousness (義)** and **protects the vulnerable**. | Sacrificing corrupt officials to **save lives** aligns with **Mencius’** "kill one to save a hundred." |
| **Legalist (法家)**  | **Pragmatic** – **Eliminates disorder** for stability.                   | Harsh but **effective**—removes **parasitic elites** to strengthen governance.   |
| **Daoist (道家)**    | **Amoral** – **Artificial interference** disrupts natural order.         | The ritual, though cruel, was a **cultural tradition**; forcing change may cause unintended harm. |
| **Modern Human Rights** | **Ethically questionable** – **Murder is murder**, regardless of motive. | Drowning officials (even corrupt ones) violates **due process** and **innocent lives**. |
| **Utilitarian**       | **Justified** – **Maximizes overall good** (saves lives, improves economy). | The **net benefit** (ending sacrifices, boosting agriculture) outweighs the **cost** (a few deaths). |
