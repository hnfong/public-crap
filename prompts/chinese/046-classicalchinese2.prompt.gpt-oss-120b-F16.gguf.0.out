<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to translate passage from Xunzi (荀子). Provide English translation, moral, and counterpart in Western thought.

First, understand passage.

Original Chinese: "魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：『諸侯自為得師之王，得友之霸，得疑之存， 自為謀而莫己若者亡。』今以不穀之不肖，...』"

Need to parse.

Actually the passage is from Xunzi, chapter "Li Lun" maybe? Let's search memory: There's a story about Wei Wu Hou (Duke of Wei) and Wu Qi (Wu Qi). He succeeded in his plans, ministers could not catch up, he retired from court with a happy expression. Wu Qi says: "Have you ever heard the words of Chu Zhuang Wang (King Zhuang of Chu)?" The Duke says: "What are they?" Wu Qi replies: "King Zhuang of Chu succeeded in his plans, ministers could not catch up, he retired from court with a worried expression. The minister Shen Gong Wu Chen (Shen Gong?) asked: 'Why are you worried?' The king said: 'I have not been able to understand the affairs (or not being able to grasp them). The ministers cannot keep up, so I worry. In the middle of the text, there is a phrase: 'The lords who think they have obtained a commander become king, those who think they have obtained a friend become hegemon, those who think they have obtained doubt become existence, those who think they have their own plan and no one can surpass them will perish.' Now, because I am not wise and my ministers cannot keep up, my state is near ruin. That's why I worry.' King Zhuang was worried, but the Duke was happy. The Duke bowed twice and said: 'Heaven sends you to correct my faults.'"

Need to translate more accurately.

Let's locate the original text: Xunzi, "Li Lun" (The Theory of Rites). Actually I think it's in "Xunzi, Li Lun" (Chapter 5). Let's search memory: The story about Wei Wu Hou (Duke of Wei) and Wu Qi (Wu Qi). The story is used to illustrate the concept of "Zhi" (knowledge) and "Zheng" (rectification). The moral: The wise ruler is aware of his own limitations and worries about the state; the incompetent ruler is complacent.

But we need to produce translation.

Let's reconstruct:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。

Wei Wu Hou (the Duke of Wei) planned affairs and succeeded; his ministers could not keep up; after retiring from court he had a happy expression.

吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

Let's translate:

Wei Wu Hou, when he plotted affairs, succeeded; none of his ministers could match him; after leaving the audience (court) he showed a happy countenance. Wu Qi advanced (stepped forward) and said: "Have you ever heard the words of Chu Zhuang Wang that were spoken to those on his side?" The Duke said: "What are the words of Chu Zhuang Wang?" Wu Qi replied: "Chu Zhuang Wang also succeeded in his plans, and his ministers could not keep up, but when he retired from court he wore a worried expression. The minister Shen Gong (or Shen Gong Wu Chen) asked: 'Why do you have a worried expression, O King?' The king answered: 'I have not been able to understand the affairs (or I have not been able to grasp the proper way), and my ministers cannot keep up, so I am worried. In the middle of the text (Zhong Hui?) there is a saying: 'When a lord thinks he has obtained a commander, he becomes a king; when he thinks he has obtained a friend, he becomes a hegemon; when he thinks he has obtained doubt, he exists; when he thinks he has his own plan and no one can surpass him, he perishes.' Now, because I am not wise and my ministers cannot keep up, my state is close to ruin. That is why I am worried.' Chu Zhuang Wang was worried, but the Duke (Wei Wu Hou) was happy." The Duke, moving a little, bowed twice and said: "Heaven has sent you, Master, to correct my faults."

But we need to refine translation.

Let's find the original Chinese text for accuracy. Search memory: Xunzi, "Li Lun" (Chapter 5). The story: "魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：『諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。』今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」"

But there may be some characters mis-copied: "不穀" maybe "不谷"? Actually "不穀" maybe "不谷" meaning "not understanding"? Could be "不穀" meaning "not aware"? Might be "不穀" meaning "not understand"? In Xunzi, "不穀" is used as "not understand" (穀 = understand). So "不穀謀事而當" means "I do not understand the affairs but succeed"? Wait "不穀" maybe "not understand" (穀 = understand). So "不穀謀事而當" means "I do not understand the affairs but succeed"? Actually "不穀" is "not understand" (like "不穀於道"). So "不穀謀事而當" maybe "I do not understand the proper way of planning affairs, yet I succeed"? That seems contradictory. Let's examine: The king says: "I do not understand the affairs (i.e., I am not wise), yet I succeed; my ministers cannot keep up; therefore I worry." So he acknowledges his own lack of understanding.

Now the moral: The story illustrates that a ruler who is aware of his own limitations and worries about the state is wise; a ruler who is complacent and happy despite similar circumstances is ignorant. The moral: The wise ruler is humble and concerned; the ignorant ruler is arrogant. Also the story shows the importance of self-reflection and listening to counsel.

Now counterpart in Western thought: The concept of "hubris" vs "caution", "the wise ruler knows his own ignorance" reminiscent of Socratic wisdom ("I know that I know nothing") and the concept of "civic virtue" in Plato's "Republic" about philosopher-kings. Also the idea that a ruler should be concerned about the state and not be complacent is similar to Machiavelli's "The Prince" (concern for stability). Also the concept of "the wise ruler is aware of his own limitations" appears in Confucian and Aristotelian virtue ethics (practical wisdom, phronesis). Also the story about King Zhuang of Chu being worried while the other ruler is happy parallels the Greek story of "Cassandra" maybe? Not exactly.

But we can discuss counterpart: In Western thought, the concept of "self-knowledge" and "humility" is central to Socratic philosophy; also the concept of "the ruler's anxiety about the state" appears in the concept of "civic humanism" of Renaissance, or "the Prince" emphasises the need for vigilance. Also the phrase "the one who thinks he is unrivaled will perish" reminiscent of the Greek proverb "Pride goes before a fall" (Proverb). Also the concept of "the wise ruler is concerned about the state, not his own success" similar to "the good king is a good steward".

Now we need to answer three parts.

Part (1) translation: Provide a clear English translation.

Part (2) moral: Provide explanation.

Part (3) counterpart: Provide analysis of similar concepts in Western thought.

Let's craft translation:

"Wei Wu Hou, when he plotted affairs, succeeded; none of his ministers could match him; after leaving the audience he wore a look of joy. Wu Qi stepped forward and said, 'Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu that were spoken to those around him?' The duke replied, 'What are the words of King Zhuang?' Wu Qi answered, 'King Zhuang of Chu also succeeded in his plans, and his ministers could not keep up, yet when he retired from court he wore a look of worry. The minister Shen Gong (or Shen Gong Wu Chen) asked him, "Why do you have a worried expression, O King?" The king said, "I do not understand the proper way of governing, yet I succeed; my ministers cannot keep up, so I am worried. In the middle of the text there is a saying: "When a lord thinks he has obtained a commander, he becomes a king; when he thinks he has obtained a friend, he becomes a hegemon; when he thinks he has obtained doubt, he merely exists; when he thinks he has his own plan and that no one can surpass him, he perishes." Now, because I am not wise and my ministers cannot keep up, my state is on the brink of ruin. That is why I am worried." King Zhuang was worried, but the duke was happy.' The duke, moving a little, bowed twice and said, 'Heaven has sent you, Master, to correct my faults.'"

But we need to refine: "退朝而有喜色" means "after leaving the court, he had a happy expression." "退朝" is "retire from the audience" (i.e., after the court session). "逡巡" maybe "hesitated" or "stepped back"? Actually "逡巡" means "to hesitate, to linger". So "武侯逡巡再拜" means "the duke lingered and bowed again". So translation: "The duke lingered, bowed again, and said..."

Now moral: The moral is about self-awareness, humility, and the importance of being concerned about the state rather than being complacent. The story shows that a ruler who is aware of his own limitations and worries about the state is wise; a ruler who is complacent and happy despite similar circumstances is ignorant. It also illustrates the principle that those who think they are unrivaled will fall.

Now counterpart: Provide analysis: The concept of "self-knowledge" (Socratic) and "hubris leads to downfall" (Greek tragedies). Also "phronesis" (practical wisdom) in Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics: the wise person knows his own limitations and acts accordingly. Also "Machiavelli's Prince" emphasises the need for vigilance and the danger of complacency. Also "Stoic concept of focusing on what is within one's control" and "concern for the common good." Also "Christian humility" and "the fear of God" as moral impetus.

Now produce final answer.

Let's craft final answer with bullet points.

Also note that the story is used by Xunzi to illustrate the concept of "Zhi" (knowledge) and "Zheng" (rectification). Provide references.

Now produce final answer.

**2.  The moral of the story**

Xunzi is using the anecdote to illustrate a classic Confucian‑Legalist lesson:

* **Self‑knowledge and humility are the marks of a wise ruler.**  
  King Zhuang, although successful, recognises that his own lack of understanding and the inability of his ministers to keep up make the state vulnerable; therefore he feels anxiety and is ready to correct himself.

* **Complacent joy in the face of the same circumstances is a sign of ignorance.**  
  Wei Wu Hou, who also succeeds while his ministers lag, is content and proud.  Wu Qi points out that such contentment blinds the ruler to the danger that “those who think they are unrivaled will perish.”

* **The ruler must be vigilant, listen to counsel, and be willing to change.**  
  The story ends with the duke’s acknowledgement that Heaven has sent a wise minister to “vibrate” (i.e., correct) his errors—an admission that the ruler’s proper response to a capable adviser is humility, not pride.

In short, the passage teaches that **true competence is accompanied by concern for the state, not self‑satisfaction; the wise ruler worries because he knows what he does not know.**

**3.  Counterparts in Western (European) thought**

| Chinese concept in the story | Rough Western analogue | Why it is comparable |
|------------------------------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| **“I do not understand the way, yet my plans work; therefore I am anxious.”** | **Socratic wisdom** – “I know that I know nothing.” (Plato, *Apology*) | Both stress that awareness of one’s ignorance is the beginning of true wisdom. |
| **“Those who think they are unrivaled will perish.”** | **Hubris leads to nemesis** – “Pride goes before a fall.” (Greek tragedies, e.g., *Oedipus Rex*; later echoed by Horace’s *Ars Poetica* “Ars est celare artem”) | The warning that over‑confidence and self‑glorification bring ruin is a common moral in classical literature. |
| **The ruler’s anxiety about the state despite personal success** | **Aristotle’s *phronesis* (practical wisdom)** – a ruler must consider the common good, not personal triumph (Nicomachean Ethics, Book VI). | Aristotle holds that the virtuous leader judges actions by their contribution to the polis, not by personal gain. |
| **Heaven sending a minister to correct the ruler** | **Divine providence / the “voice of conscience”** – e.g., Augustine’s idea that God sends a “teacher” to the errant soul; also the medieval notion of the *princeps* being guided by wise counsel (e.g., Thomas Aquinas, *Summa* I‑II, q. 1, a. 8). | The belief that a higher order (Heaven, God, Providence) supplies wise counsel to the ruler when he errs. |
| **The contrast between a happy, complacent ruler and a worried, self‑critical one** | **Machiavelli’s *Prince*** – a ruler must be ever‑watchful, fearing loss of power; complacency is dangerous (chap. 7, “On New Principalities”). | Machiavelli stresses that a prudent prince is never at ease; he must constantly anticipate threats, much as King Zhuang does. |
| **The idea that a ruler’s personal virtue is essential for the state’s survival** | **Civic Humanism** (Renaissance) – the belief that the moral character of the magistrate determines the health of the republic (e.g., Petrarch, *De viris illustribus*). | Both traditions link the moral integrity of the leader with the fate of the polity. |

Thus, while the story is rooted in the Chinese tradition of Confucian‑Legalist political philosophy, its core ideas—humility before one’s own ignorance, the danger of hubris, the necessity of vigilant, self‑critical leadership—have clear parallels in the moral and political thought of ancient Greece, Rome, medieval Scholasticism, and early modern political theory.
