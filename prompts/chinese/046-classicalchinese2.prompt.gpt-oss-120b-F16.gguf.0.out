<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to translate passage from Xunzi (荀子). Provide English translation, explain moral, and discuss counterpart in Western thought.

First, understand passage.

Original Chinese:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師之王，得友之霸，得疑之存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君（? maybe "武侯"?）以喜。」武侯逡循再拜曰：「天使夫子振振(??)振寡人之過也。」 (some characters may be mis-copied)

Let's parse.

魏武侯 (Duke of Wei, also known as Wei Wu Hou) is planning affairs and is successful (謀事而當). The ministers cannot match him (群臣莫能逮). He retires from court (退朝) with a happy expression (有喜色). Wu Qi (吳起) says: "Have you ever heard the words of Chu Zhuang Wang (楚莊王) from the left and right?" (i.e., have you heard the story of Chu Zhuang Wang). The Duke says: "What are the words of Chu Zhuang Wang?" Wu Qi replies: "Chu Zhuang Wang also planned affairs and succeeded, but his ministers could not match him, and after court he had a worried expression. The minister Shen Gong (申公) and Wu Chen (巫臣) advanced and asked: 'Why does the king have a worried expression after court?' The Zhuang King said: 'Because I do not understand (不穀?) the planning and success, and the ministers cannot match me, so I am worried. In the words of Zhong Kui? Actually "中蘬之言" maybe "Zhong Bi"? Let's parse: "其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」" This is a quote from Zhong Bi (Zhong Bi?), a philosopher. The quote: "When the feudal lords have a teacher (or a commander) they become king; when they have a friend they become hegemon; when they have doubt they survive; when they plan for themselves and no one matches them, they perish." Something like that.

Now: "今以不穀之不肖，群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。" Means: "Now, because of my own lack of insight (不穀) and my unworthiness, and because my ministers cannot match me, my state is near destruction! Hence I am worried."

Chu Zhuang Wang is worried, but the Duke (武侯) is happy. The Duke bows twice and says: "Heaven sends you, Master, to correct my faults." (天使夫子振寡人之過也). Something like that.

Thus moral: humility, self-awareness, the importance of being concerned about the inability of ministers, not being complacent. The story shows that a ruler who is successful should be worried if his ministers cannot match him, because that indicates a lack of talent and risk to the state. The moral is to be cautious, to value capable ministers, to avoid overconfidence.

Now we need to answer three parts.

(1) Provide translation.

(2) Explain moral.

(3) Does the concept have counterpart in Western thought? Yes: concept of "the ruler's responsibility to cultivate capable ministers", "the danger of a ruler's excellence outpacing his ministers", "the idea of "the wise ruler is concerned about the state, not his own success". In Western thought, similar to Plato's "philosopher-king" and the need for wise advisors, also Machiavelli's advice about surrounding oneself with capable ministers, the concept of "hubris" and "the fall of great men due to lack of counsel". Also the concept of "the tragedy of the competent leader with incompetent subordinates" appears in Greek tragedies, e.g., Oedipus, or in the concept of "the wise ruler's anxiety about the state" in Aristotle's Politics. Also the concept of "the problem of the 'great man' outpacing his environment" appears in modern political theory (e.g., "the tyranny of the capable").

Also the quote from Zhong Bi: "When a ruler has a capable general, he becomes a king; when he has a capable ally, he becomes hegemon; when he has doubt, he persists; when he plans alone and no one matches him, he perishes." This resonates with the idea of "balance of power" and "the need for competent subordinates".

We can discuss parallels: In the Bible, King David's worry about his lack of wise counselors; in Roman thought, Cicero's "prudentia" and "virtus" requiring wise advisors; in Enlightenment, Montesquieu's separation of powers; in modern management, the concept of "leadership vs. management" and "the importance of building a strong team".

Also the concept of "self-awareness and humility" is a virtue in Christian ethics (humility before God). The story's moral: a ruler should be concerned about the state, not just his own success; he should be humble and seek wise counsel.

Now produce answer.

Will include translation with footnotes for obscure terms.

Will explain moral.

Will discuss counterpart: Greek philosophy (Plato's "philosopher-king", Aristotle's "the best ruler must have good counselors"), Roman (Cicero's "consilium"), Christian (St. Augustine's humility), Machiavelli (the need for capable ministers), modern management (Peter Drucker, "the most important thing is to have the right people").

Will also mention concept of "Zhong Bi's statement" and its parallels to "the law of the jungle" or "the principle of mutual dependence".

Now produce final answer.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**1.  Translation (with brief notes on obscure terms)**  

> **Wei Wu‑Hou** (the Duke of Wei) was formulating a state‑affair and got it exactly right; none of his ministers could keep up with him. After leaving the audience hall he wore a look of **joy**.  
>   
> **Wu Qi** stepped forward and said, “Sir, have you ever heard the story of **Chu Zhuang‑Wang** that was told on the left‑ and right‑hand side of the court?”  
>   
> The Duke replied, “What is the story of Chu Zhuang‑Wang?”  
>   
> Wu Qi answered, “Chu Zhuang‑Wang also planned his affairs and succeeded, but his ministers could not match him, and when he retired from the audience hall his face was **troubled**.  
>   
> The minister **Shen‑gong** and the witch‑priest **Wu‑chen** (both of whom served Chu) asked him, ‘Why do you look worried after the audience?’  
>   
> The king answered, ‘Because I do not **understand** (不穀 ‘cannot grasp’) the way to plan correctly, and because none of my ministers can keep up with me; therefore I am anxious. In the words of **Zhong‑Bi** (a contemporary thinker) it is said:  
>   
> > “When a feudal lord has a commander he becomes a king; when he has a friend he becomes a hegemon; when he has doubt he merely survives; when he makes plans by himself and no one can equal him, he perishes.”  
>   
> “Now, because of my own lack of insight and my unworthiness, and because none of my ministers can keep pace, my state is on the brink of ruin! That is why I am worried.’”  
>   
> Chu Zhuang‑Wang was filled with worry, whereas **you** are filled with joy.  
>   
> The Duke of Wei, after bowing twice, said, “Heaven has sent you, Master, to point out the faults of my reign.”  

*Notes*

**2.  The moral of the story**

The passage is a classic Xunzi illustration of **the ruler’s proper attitude toward his own ability and the talent of his ministers**.  

1. **Self‑awareness and humility** – Even a ruler who succeeds in his own plans should be uneasy if his subordinates cannot match his competence. Success that is not shared or supported by capable officials is precarious.  

2. **The danger of “great man” isolation** – When a sovereign’s ability outstrips that of his court, the state becomes vulnerable: the ruler cannot delegate, cannot be replaced, and the administration collapses if anything happens to him.  

3. **The value of good counsel** – The story praises Wu Qi’s willingness to bring an ancient precedent (the lament of Chu Zhuang‑Wang) to the Duke’s attention, showing that a wise ruler must **listen to frank, knowledgeable ministers**.  

4. **Heaven’s role as moral overseer** – The Duke’s final remark, “Heaven has sent you, Master, to point out my faults,” acknowledges that moral insight (the “Mandate of Heaven”) works through virtuous advisors.  

In short, Xunzi is teaching that **a ruler should be vigilant, modest, and eager to correct his own shortcomings, especially when his ministers are not up to the task**. Joy that stems from personal triumph alone is misplaced; true joy belongs to a ruler whose whole administration is competent.

**3.  Counterparts in Western (European) thought**

The ideas in the anecdote have several clear analogues in the classical, medieval, and modern Western tradition.

| Xunzi’s theme | Western analogue(s) | Brief comparison |
|---------------|--------------------|------------------|
| **A ruler’s anxiety when his ministers are inferior** | **Plato’s “philosopher‑king”** ( *Republic* 5‑6) – the ruler must be the most knowledgeable, but he also needs “guardians” who are properly educated; otherwise the state is at risk. <br> **Aristotle’s “necessity of good counselors”** (*Politics* 5) – the best ruler is one who surrounds himself with capable *sophists* (advisors). | Both stress that a wise ruler cannot act alone; the health of the polity depends on the quality of the advisory corps. |
| **Humility and self‑correction** | **Stoic humility** (Seneca, *De Constantia*; Epictetus) – the wise man recognizes his own limitations and welcomes correction. <br> **Christian virtue of humility** (St. Augustine, *Confessions*; Thomas Aquinas, *Summa Theologiae*) – true wisdom begins with acknowledging one’s own faults. | The Duke’s acceptance of Wu Qi’s criticism mirrors the Stoic/Christian ideal that moral progress comes from recognizing one’s errors. |
| **The danger of “great man” outpacing his environment** | **Machiavelli’s advice** ( *The Prince* ch. 22) – a prince must have capable ministers; otherwise his power is fragile. <br> **Thomas Hobbes’s “sovereign’s reliance on competent officers”** (*Leviathan* ch. 18) – the stability of the commonwealth rests on the competence of its officials. | Both warn that a ruler’s personal ability is insufficient; institutional support is essential. |
| **Heaven (or a higher moral order) sending a wise counselor** | **Divine Providence in the Bible** (e.g., Nathan confronting King David, 2 Sam. 12) – God uses a prophet to point out the king’s sin. <br> **Providential “angel” in medieval thought** – wise advisors are seen as instruments of God’s will. | The Duke’s statement that Heaven has sent Wu Qi parallels the biblical motif of a prophet/angel correcting a monarch. |
| **Zhong‑Bi’s maxim about “when no one can match the ruler, he perishes”** | **The “hubris” motif** in Greek tragedy (e.g., Oedipus, Sophocles) – a man’s overreaching without equal counsel leads to downfall. <br> **The “law of the jungle” in Hobbes** – without a balance of power, the sovereign’s unchecked ambition can cause chaos. | The warning that solitary brilliance without peers is self‑destructive is a recurring theme in Western literature and political theory. |

Thus, while the *Xunzi* passage is rooted in early Chinese political philosophy, its core concerns—**the necessity of competent subordinates, the ruler’s humility, and the moral function of wise counsel**—are echoed throughout the Western canon, from Plato and Aristotle to the Christian tradition, the Renaissance political treatises of Machiavelli, and modern management theory (e.g., Peter Drucker’s emphasis on “the right people” as the most important resource). The story can therefore be read as a universal lesson on leadership that transcends cultural boundaries. [end of text]
