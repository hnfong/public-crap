This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

Translation:

The passage describes a story from the ancient Chinese philosopher Xunzi, in which Emperor Wu of Zhou advises the King of Wuling (known as Wulingyuan at the time) to avoid committing tyrannical acts and instead lead his subjects with gentleness and compassion. Wu urges him to avoid the dangerous idea of overthrowing his predecessor and instead focus on preserving his reign. In response, the King advises him to beware of the power of those who seek to manipulate him and cautions him against the negative emotions that can cause him to lose his vision. The moral of the story is that leaders should strive to maintain a sense of proportion in their actions, avoiding overzealousness and excessive ambition, and instead focusing on the greater good of their people. This concept is echoed in Western thought, particularly in the works of John Locke, who argues for a balance between individual liberty and collective stability in his book "Of Civil Government." The concepts in the story have a counterpart in Western thought, as Locke's ideas on government and individual rights have influenced thinkers such as Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.</s>
