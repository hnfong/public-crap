◁think▷Okay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants me to translate a passage from 荀子 into English, explain the moral, and check if there's a Western equivalent.

First, the translation. The story is about 魏武侯 (Wei Wu Hou) who is pleased when his decision is better than his ministers. 吳起 (Wu Qi) reminds him of 楚莊王's (Chu Zhuang Wang) reaction, which was worry instead of joy. The moral is that being too confident when no one can match you is dangerous, as Chu Zhuang Wang's quote suggests.

So, translating each part:

- 魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰： → Wei Wu Hou made a correct decision, none of his ministers could match it, so he was happy after court. Wu Qi approached and said:

- 「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」 → "Have you heard Chu Zhuang Wang's words?" Wu Qi asked. Wu Hou replied, "What did he say?"

- 吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰： → Wu Qi said, "Chu Zhuang Wang was worried when he was better than his ministers. His minister asked why he was sad."

- 「不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。」 → Chu Zhuang Wang explained that if a ruler has no one to challenge him, the country is in danger. The quote says those who have teachers become kings, friends become霸 (hegemon), doubters survive, and those who think no one is better than them will perish.

- 楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」 → Wu Qi contrasts Chu's worry with Wu Hou's joy. Then Wu Hou thanks Wu Qi for pointing out his mistake.

Now, the moral. The story teaches that when a leader makes a decision that no one can match, it's a cause for concern, not celebration. Because if the leader is always right, it means there's no one to challenge or correct him, leading to potential downfall. The Chu Zhuang Wang's quote is the key here, emphasizing the importance of having advisors who can question or outperform the leader to prevent complacency.

For the Western equivalent, this reminds me of the concept of the "fool's gold" of leadership, where overconfidence leads to failure. Or perhaps the idea of the "wisdom of crowds" where diverse opinions are valuable. Another parallel could be the Greek concept of hubris, where excessive pride leads to a downfall. Also, the Roman statesman Cicero once said, "To be able to look down upon everybody else is the truest sign of a fool," which aligns with the idea that thinking no one is better than you is dangerous.

So, the Western counterparts would be the warnings against hubris, the importance of having advisors who can challenge the leader, and the dangers of complacency in leadership.

(1) **English Translation:**

Wei Wu Hou made a correct decision, none of his ministers could match it, so he was happy after court. Wu Qi approached and said, "Have you heard Chu Zhuang Wang's words?" Wu Hou replied, "What did he say?"

Wu Qi said, "Chu Zhuang Wang was worried when he was better than his ministers. His minister asked why he was sad. Chu Zhuang Wang explained, 'If I'm correct and no one can match me, that's cause for worry. As the saying goes: "Those who have teachers become kings, those who have friends become hegemonic, those who have doubters survive, and those who think no one is better than them will perish." Now, with my incompetence, and no ministers matching me, our country is near ruin! That's why I'm worried.'"

"Chu Zhuang Wang was worried, but you're happy." Wu Hou then bowed deeply and said, "The heavens have sent you to correct my mistake."

(2) **Moral of the Story:**

The story teaches that when a leader makes decisions that no one can match, it's a cause for concern rather than celebration. The Chu Zhuang Wang quote underscores the importance of having advisors who can challenge or outperform the leader to prevent complacency and potential downfall. The key takeaway is that overconfidence in one's own judgment without external checks is dangerous.

(3) **Western Counterparts:**

- **Hubris and Nemesis:** The Greek concept of hubris (excessive pride) leading to nemesis (downfall) mirrors the warning against overconfidence.
- **Cicero's Wisdom:** The Roman statesman Cicero said, "To be able to look down upon everybody else is the truest sign of a fool," which aligns with the idea that thinking no one is better than you is dangerous.
- **Leadership Accountability:** Western political thought emphasizes the need for checks and balances, advisor diversity, and the importance of dissenting voices to prevent groupthink and poor decision-making.
- **Socratic Humility:** Socrates' famous statement that he knows nothing reflects a humility that can lead to better learning and decision-making, similar to seeking advisors who can teach or challenge you. [end of text]
