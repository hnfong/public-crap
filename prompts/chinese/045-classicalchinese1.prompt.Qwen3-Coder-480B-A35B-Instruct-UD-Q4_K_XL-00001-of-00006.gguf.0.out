**Q1: Give a short summary of the story (5 points)**  
During the time of Marquis Wen of Wei, Ximen Bao, as the magistrate of Ye, investigated the local practice of offering young girls to the River Lord (He Bo) to prevent flooding. He exposed the corruption of local elders and witches who exploited this belief to enrich themselves. At the next ritual, he cleverly tricked and threw the witch and her accomplices into the river, ending the practice. He then led the people in building irrigation canals, which initially caused hardship but later brought prosperity. His actions earned him lasting respect.

**Q2: What kind of women were usually the victims in the story (2 points)**  
Young girls from poor families, especially those considered beautiful by the witch.

**Q3: Who were deemed to benefit from the old practice of offering girls? (2 points)**  
The local elders (三老), witch (巫), and officials (廷掾) who collected money and shared the profits.

**Q4: Did the protagonist use wits or force to deal with the situation? Explain (5 points)**  
Ximen Bao used **wits**. He pretended to comply with the ritual but used logic and performance to expose its absurdity. By requesting the witch and others to "report to the River Lord," he gradually eliminated the corrupt leaders without direct violence, using their own beliefs and fear against them.

**Q5: Was it moral for the protagonist to do so? Briefly provide views from various perspectives (10 points)**  
- **Utilitarian view**: Yes, his actions saved innocent lives and led to long-term prosperity.  
- **Deontological view**: Deceit is morally questionable, even for good ends.  
- **Cultural context**: He acted justly by opposing harmful superstition and corruption.  
- **Consequentialist view**: The positive outcomes (abolition of abuse, improved livelihoods) justify his means.  
- **Virtue ethics**: His courage, wisdom, and compassion reflect moral virtue.

**Q6: At the end of 滑稽列传, it is said that: "傳曰：「子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。」三子之才能誰最賢哉？辨治者當能別之。" -- explain what it means, and whether the comment is fair. (15 points)**  
**Meaning**: The passage compares three virtuous officials:  
- **Zi Chan** governed Zheng so effectively that people **could not deceive** him.  
- **Zi Jian** governed Danfu so virtuously that people **did not忍** (couldn’t bear to) deceive him.  
- **Ximen Bao** governed Ye so strictly that people **dared not** deceive him.  

Each represents a different style of governance:  
- Zi Chan = competence and clarity  
- Zi Jian = moral example and trust  
- Ximen Bao = authority and deterrence  

**Fairness of comment**:  
Yes, it is fair. It acknowledges that effective governance can take different forms depending on context. Ximen Bao’s method was strict but necessary to end a brutal custom. The comment invites reflection on which approach is most virtuous, recognizing that all three were capable leaders in their own right. [end of text]
