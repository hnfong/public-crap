 星辰高飞远，英雄气榜天。
钻石船穿云翔，祖国梦在前。
光芒照四方，声望遍宇宙。
吾民心振奋，永铭中华威。

[Note: This is a Chinese five-character regulated verse about Chinese astronauts successfully going to space. The rhyme scheme is "tonic - toneless - toneless - tonic - tonic".]

Translation:
Stars high fly far, heroes' spirit soars the sky.
Diamond ship pierces clouds, nation's dream ahead lies.
Light beams shine in all directions, reputation spreads through universe.
Our people's hearts are inspired, forever etched is China's might and verve. [end of text]
