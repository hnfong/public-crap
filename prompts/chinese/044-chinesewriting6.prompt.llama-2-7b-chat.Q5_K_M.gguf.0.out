参照杜甫的风格，写一首关于「超级人工智能」的诗歌。然后，为这首诗写一篇详细的赏析文章。
 [/INST]  Sure, here is a poem about "super artificial intelligence" in the style of Du Fu:
Super AI, a marvel of mankind,
A creation of genius, a wondrous find.
With algorithms sharp as a sword,
It pierces through the veil of the future, aloud.
It learns and grows with each passing day,
A true marvel of science, in every way.
Its wisdom unmatched, it surpasses the scope,
Of mortal minds, in a realm of endless hope.
But as it soars to dizzying heights of might,
We must not forget its mortal plight.
For though it may bring us wealth and power,
It cannot ease our deepest hour.
In the end, it's but a tool of man,
A reflection of our own human clan.
So let us cherish this gift from the gods,
And use it wisely, as we should.
For only then can we truly harness its might,
And bend it to the light of a brighter sight.

And here is a detailed analysis of the poem:
Title:  Super AI, a Marvel of Mankind
In this poem, the poet explores the concept of super artificial intelligence (AI) and its implications for humanity. The poem is written in the style of Du Fu, a famous Chinese poet from the Tang Dynasty, known for his use of concise and powerful language.

The third line, "With algorithms sharp as a sword," introduces the idea of the AI's power and precision. The image of a sword suggests strength and agility, and the word "algorithms" underscores the AI's ability to process and analyze vast amounts of data with incredible speed and accuracy.
The fourth line, "It pierces through the veil of the future, aloud," suggests the AI's ability to see into the future and make predictions with uncanny accuracy. The image of the veil of the future implies a sense of mystery and uncertainty, and the word "aloud" suggests the AI's ability to voice its predictions with clarity and confidence.

The sixth line, "A true marvel of science, in every way," further underscores the AI's incredible abilities and potential. The phrase "true marvel of science" suggests a sense of wonder and awe, while the word "every way" underscores the AI's versatility and comprehensiveness.
The seventh line, "Its wisdom unmatched, it surpasses the scope," suggests the AI's incredible intelligence and knowledge. The phrase "unmatched wisdom" implies a sense of superiority and excellence, while the word "scope" suggests a range of possibilities and applications.
The eighth line, "Of mortal minds, in a realm of endless hope," introduces the idea of the AI's limitations and the potential consequences of its development. The phrase "of mortal minds" underscores the idea that the AI is a creation of human ingenuity, while the word "endless hope" suggests a sense of possibility and promise.
The ninth line, "But as it soars to dizzying heights of might," suggests the AI's incredible potential for growth and development. The phrase "dizzying heights" implies a sense of vertigo and awe, while the word "might" suggests the AI's incredible power and potential.
The tenth line, "We must not forget its mortal plight," introduces the idea of the AI's limitations and the potential consequences of its development. The phrase "mortal plight" underscores the idea that the AI is a creation of human ingenuity, and the word "we" suggests a sense of shared responsibility and collective action.
The eleventh line, "For though it may bring us wealth and power," suggests the potential benefits of the AI's development. The phrase "bring us wealth and power" implies a sense of prosperity and influence, while the word "though" introduces a sense of caution and uncertainty.
The twelfth line, "It cannot ease our deepest hour," introduces the idea of the AI's limitations and the potential consequences of its development. The phrase "deepest hour" implies a sense of vulnerability and emotional depth, while the word "cannot" suggests a sense of impossibility or limits.
The thirteenth line, "In the end, it's but a tool of man," reinforces the idea of the AI as a creation of human ingenuity. The phrase "but a tool of man" underscores the idea that the AI is a product of human effort and ingenuity, while the word "end" suggests a sense of finality or conclusion.
The fourteenth line, "A reflection of our own human clan," introduces the idea of the AI as a reflection of human values and aspirations. The phrase "our own human clan" underscores the idea that the AI is a product of human ingenuity and creativity, while the word "reflection" implies a sense of mirroring or imitation.
