Certainly! Here's your requested analysis of the passage from 荀子 (Xunzi):

—

**(1) Translation into English:**

Wei Wu Hou, after successfully planning a matter and finding no minister could match him, returned from court with a pleased expression. Wu Qi stepped forward and said:  
“Have you ever heard the words of Chu Zhuang Wang, spoken to those around him?”  
Wu Hou asked: “What did Chu Zhuang Wang say?”  
Wu Qi replied:  
“Chu Zhuang Wang, after successfully planning a matter and finding no minister could match him, returned from court with a worried expression. Shen Gong Wu Chen approached and asked: ‘Your Majesty appears troubled — what is the matter?’  
Chu Zhuang Wang replied: ‘I have planned successfully, and no minister can match me — that is why I am worried. It is because of the words of Zhong Hui: “Among the feudal lords, those who find a teacher become kings; those who find a friend become hegemonic powers; those who find a rival survive; but those who think they are the only ones capable of planning will perish.” Now, given my own unworthiness, yet no minister can match me — does this not mean our state is perilously close to destruction? That is why I am worried.’  
Chu Zhuang Wang was worried, but you, Your Majesty, are pleased.  
Wu Hou stood in respectful hesitation, then bowed twice: ‘Heaven has sent you, Master Wu Qi, to correct my mistake.’”

**(2) Moral of the Story:**

The moral is a warning against arrogance born of success. Even when one is successful — especially when one is unmatched in ability — one must remain humble and vigilant. Chu Zhuang Wang’s worry stemmed not from failure, but from the realization that his own greatness might isolate him from the wisdom of others, and that such isolation could lead to downfall. Wu Qi’s lesson is that true leadership requires self-awareness and the humility to recognize that one’s success may be a sign of danger, not triumph.

In essence:  
> **Success without humility is the beginning of ruin.**  
> **A ruler must be wary of the danger of self-satisfaction — even when surrounded by capable ministers, one must never forget the peril of thinking oneself indispensable.**

This is a classic Confucian and Xunzi-style admonition: rulers must cultivate moral self-discipline, recognize their own limitations, and remain open to counsel — even when they are the most capable.

**(3) Counterpart in Western (European) Thought?**

Yes — there are several Western philosophical counterparts to this idea:

**a) Socrates’ “I know that I know nothing”**  
Socrates famously claimed that his wisdom lay in recognizing his own ignorance. This is the opposite of the arrogant ruler — he was humble despite his intellectual prowess. The idea that true wisdom lies in knowing one’s limits is a direct parallel.

**b) The “hubris” motif in Greek tragedy**  
In tragedies like “Oedipus Rex” or “Agamemnon,” the downfall of the hero is often caused by excessive pride — hubris — after success or victory. Oedipus, for example, is proud of solving the riddle of the Sphinx and becomes king, but his arrogance blinds him to the truth, leading to his ruin. This mirrors Chu Zhuang Wang’s worry — the wise ruler knows that pride leads to downfall.

**c) Machiavelli’s warning in “The Prince”**  
While Machiavelli is often seen as advocating ruthless pragmatism, he also warns rulers to be cautious about appearing too powerful or too self-satisfied. He advises rulers to appear humble and to avoid seeming “above” their subjects — a subtle echo of the need for self-restraint.

**d) The “Dunning-Kruger Effect” (modern psychology)**  
Though not a philosophical concept, this psychological phenomenon describes how people with low ability often overestimate their competence — and those with high ability may underestimate their own limitations. The story warns against the latter: the most capable person may be the most dangerous if they fail to recognize their own fallibility.

**e) The “Paradox of Success” in modern leadership theory**  
Many modern management and leadership texts warn that success can breed complacency — and that leaders must constantly seek feedback and remain open to criticism. The story is a timeless reminder that success is not the end, but a warning sign.

**Conclusion:**

The story from Xunzi is not merely a historical anecdote — it is a profound moral lesson that resonates across cultures and eras. The idea that success without humility is dangerous is universal. Whether in ancient China, ancient Greece, or modern management theory, the warning remains: **true strength lies not in being the best, but in knowing when you are not — and being willing to learn.**
