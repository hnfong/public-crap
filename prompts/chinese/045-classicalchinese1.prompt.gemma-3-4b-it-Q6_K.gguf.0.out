Okay, here are the answers to your questions about the text from 滑稽列传, aiming for conciseness as requested:

**Q1: Give a short summary of the story (5 points)**

西门豹, appointed governor of Ye (邺), uncovered a corrupt practice where local officials were exploiting the populace by demanding girls as brides for the River God (河伯). After a dramatic ritual involving a failed attempt to procure a suitable bride, and a subsequent demonstration of the officials’ corruption, he used his authority to redirect the river, providing irrigation and ending the practice.  He then secured the long-term benefits for the people, becoming renowned for his just rule.

**Q2: What kind of women were usually the victims in the story (2 points)**

Young, unmarried women from the city were typically chosen as potential brides for the River God, often daughters of wealthy families who couldn’t afford other options.

**Q3. Who were deemed to benefit from the old practice of offering girls? (2 points)**

The local officials (三老, 廷掾, 豪长者) and the River God’s attendants (祝巫) benefited, as they profited from the money collected through extortion and the lavish wedding preparations.

**Q4: Did the protagonist use wits or force to deal with the situation? Explain (5 points)**

Westmen Bao primarily used **force and intimidation**, initially through the dramatic ritual and the disposal of the old woman. However, he also employed a degree of **strategic manipulation**. He leveraged the public outrage and the officials’ fear to force them to abandon the practice. He didn’t rely on clever arguments but on demonstrating the depth of the corruption and using the threat of further consequences.

**Q5: Was it moral for the protagonist to do so? Briefly provide views from various perspectives (10 points)**

*   **Westmen Bao’s Perspective:**  He believed it was morally justifiable to end the exploitation and provide relief to the suffering people. His actions were driven by a sense of justice and a desire to improve the lives of his subjects.
*   **The People’s Perspective:** Initially, they were victims of oppression. Bao’s actions were seen as a liberation and a restoration of their rights.
*   **The Officials’ Perspective:** They were acting in self-interest, exploiting the people for personal gain. Bao’s actions were a direct challenge to their authority and a betrayal of their established system.
*   **A Moralist’s Perspective:**  Some might argue that Bao’s methods were harsh and potentially unjust, resorting to intimidation and even disposing of the old woman. However, the ends (ending exploitation and improving the lives of the people) could be seen as justifying the means.

**Q6: At the end of 滑稽列传, it is said that: "傳曰：「子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。」三子之才能誰最賢哉？辨治者當能別之。" -- explain what it means, and whether the comment is fair. (15 points)**

This quote highlights a comparison of three notable figures in Chinese history: Zichuan (who ruled Zheng), Ziyun (who ruled Danfu), and Westmen Bao (who ruled Ye). It states that each ruler was able to govern effectively because the people *could not* be deceived, *could not* be bullied, and *could not* be intimidated, respectively.

The comment is **fair, but nuanced**. It suggests that effective governance hinges on establishing trust and respect with the populace. Westmen Bao’s success stemmed from his ability to expose and dismantle a system of corruption, thereby earning the people’s confidence and preventing them from being exploited.  However, it’s also a somewhat harsh judgment, implying that Bao’s methods were forceful and potentially ruthless.  A truly wise ruler, according to this perspective, would have sought a more gentle and persuasive approach, though perhaps less effective in this particular situation.  The quote emphasizes the importance of a ruler’s relationship with the people as the key to lasting success.
