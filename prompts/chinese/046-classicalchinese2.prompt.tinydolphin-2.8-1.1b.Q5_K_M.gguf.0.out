This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

 1. The story is about a prince who is given a great opportunity by the god of war but becomes greedy and does not share the benefits with his subjects.
2. The moral of the story is that when a ruler is greedy and does not share the benefits with their subjects, they may lose their popularity and end up losing their kingdom.
3. The concept of "憂色" in the story does not have a direct counterpart in Western (European) thought. "吳起" is a Chinese term for envy or jealousy, not a concept found in Western thought.<|im_end|>
