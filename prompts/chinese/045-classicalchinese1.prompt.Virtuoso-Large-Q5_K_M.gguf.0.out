During the reign of Duke Wen of Wei, Ximen Bao was appointed as the magistrate of Ye. Upon arrival, he learned that the people were impoverished due to the annual practice of sacrificing young women to the river god, River Lord (河伯).

### Q4: Did the protagonist use wits or force to deal with the situation? Explain (5 points)
Ximen Bao used a combination of wits and force.

This approach not only stopped the practice but also instilled fear and respect among the people.

### Q5: Was it moral for the protagonist to do so? Briefly provide views from various perspectives (10 points)

### Q6: At the end of 滑稽列传, it is said that: "傳曰：「子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。」三子之才能誰最賢哉？辨治者當能別之。" -- explain what it means, and whether the comment is fair. (15 points)
This passage means: "It is said that when Zichan governed Zheng, the people could not deceive him; when Zijian governed Shanfu, the people were unwilling to deceive him; when Ximen Bao governed Ye, the people did not dare to deceive him. Among these three, who was the most virtuous? Those skilled in governance should be able to distinguish."

The comment is fair in that it highlights the unique strengths of each leader:
- **Zichan**: Known for his wisdom and ability to see through deception.
- **Zijian**: Known for his moral influence and the trust he inspired in the people.
- **Ximen Bao**: Known for his firmness and the respect and fear he commanded.

Each leader had a different approach to governance, and the comment suggests that a skilled observer can appreciate the distinct virtues of each. The fairness lies in recognizing that different contexts may require different leadership styles, and all three were effective in their own ways. [end of text]
