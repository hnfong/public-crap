### (1) Translation of the Story into English:

In the state of Wei, Duke Wu of Wei was discussing state affairs and handled them appropriately, with no minister able to match his wisdom. After the court session, he showed a pleased expression. Wu Qi approached him and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu from your attendants?"

Duke Wu of Wei asked, "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?"

Wu Qi replied, "King Zhuang of Chu, when discussing state affairs and handling them appropriately, with no minister able to match his wisdom, showed a worried expression after the court session. Shen Gong Wu Chen approached him and asked, 'Why do you show a worried expression after the court session?'

King Zhuang of Chu said, 'I handle state affairs appropriately, yet no minister can match my wisdom, which is why I am worried. There is a saying from Zhong Kui: "A ruler who gains a teacher will rule as a king, one who gains a friend will rule as aéœ¸, one who gains a counselor will survive, but one who plans alone and finds no equal will perish." Now, with my incompetence, and no minister able to match my wisdom, our state is close to perishing! That is why I am worried.'

King Zhuang of Chu showed worry, while you, my lord, show joy."

Duke Wu of Wei hesitated and bowed twice, saying, "Heaven has sent you to correct my mistake."

### (2) Explanation of the Moral of the Story:

The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should not be complacent when he excels in governance or decision-making. Instead, he should be concerned if he finds no one capable of matching his wisdom, as this indicates a lack of capable advisors or ministers. A ruler who is isolated in his abilities and lacks competent subordinates is in a precarious position, as he cannot receive counsel or support, which is essential for the stability and longevity of the state. The story emphasizes the importance of surrounding oneself with capable and wise advisors, as a ruler alone cannot sustain the state without the help of others.

### (3) Counterpart in Western (European) Thought:

The concept in the story has a counterpart in Western thought, particularly in the idea of the "counsel of many" or the "council of wise men." This is reflected in the classical Greek and Roman traditions, where the importance of seeking advice from wise and capable individuals was emphasized. For example, in Plato's *Republic*, the ideal ruler (the philosopher-king) is advised to seek the counsel of the wise and to create a just society through the collaboration of different classes. Similarly, in the Roman tradition, the Senate played a crucial role in advising the emperor, and the idea of the "good king" was often associated with one who listened to the advice of his council.

In more modern Western thought, the idea is echoed in the Enlightenment principle of "checks and balances," where the power of a ruler or government is tempered by the presence of other institutions or advisors. The idea that a ruler should not be complacent and should seek the counsel of others is also reflected in the works of political philosophers like Machiavelli, who emphasized the importance of having capable advisors and a well-functioning council to support the ruler.

In summary, the story's emphasis on the importance of seeking counsel and not being complacent about one's abilities has parallels in Western thought, particularly in the classical and Enlightenment traditions. [end of text]
