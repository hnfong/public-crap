**Q1: Summary (5 points)**
During the Wei Dynasty, Ximen豹 was appointed magistrate of Ye. He discovered that local officials and a witch were exploiting the superstition of "marrying women to the River God" to extort money and drown young girls. Ximen豹 used wit to end this practice: at the ceremony, he claimed the chosen girl was ugly and threw the witch and corrupt officials into the river to "report" to the god, terrifying the accomplices into stopping the ritual. He later built canals to irrigate the land, securing long-term prosperity despite initial public resistance.

**Q2: Victims (2 points)**
The victims were usually beautiful young girls from poor or common families ("小家女好者").

**Q3: Beneficiaries (2 points)**
The local officials (the "Three Elders" and court clerks) and the witch/warlocks benefited by embezzling the funds collected for the ritual.

**Q4: Wits or Force? (5 points)**
The protagonist primarily used **wits**. Instead of using physical force to ban the ritual or arrest the culprits immediately—which would have been difficult due to deep-seated superstition—he pretended to take the superstition seriously. By inventing a logical reason (the girl was ugly) to send the witch and officials to the afterlife, he turned their own superstition against them, effectively eliminating the corrupt leadership without inciting a riot.

**Q5: Morality (10 points)**
*   **Utilitarian/Consequentialist View:** It was moral. The action saved countless innocent girls from death, stopped massive financial exploitation, and eventually led to the irrigation canals that benefited the entire region for generations. The deaths of a few corrupt individuals were a necessary sacrifice for the greater good.
*   **Deontological/Rights-based View:** It was immoral. Ximen豹 acted as judge, jury, and executioner without a trial. Executing people (even the witch) by drowning is cruel and violates the right to life, regardless of their crimes.
*   **Political/Pragmatic View:** It was a necessary evil. In a lawless and superstitious environment, strict adherence to legal procedure might have failed. His drastic measures established authority and fear, which were required to restore order and implement public works.

**Q6: Explanation and Fairness (15 points)**
*   **Meaning:** The quote contrasts three styles of governance:
    *   *Zi Chan (Zheng):* "People cannot deceive" – achieved through intelligence, strict laws, and effective administration.
    *   *Zi Jian (Danfu):* "People cannot bear to deceive" – achieved through moral virtue and leading by example, inspiring love in the people.
    *   *Ximen豹 (Ye):* "People dare not deceive" – achieved through strict punishment, power, and fear.
    The text asks a wise observer to distinguish between these talents.
*   **Fairness:** The comment is fair and insightful. It accurately categorizes Ximen豹’s specific achievement in Ye. He did not change the hearts of the people (like Zi Jian) nor rely purely on bureaucratic perfection (like Zi Chan); he relied on shock and fear to break a corrupt system. The distinction acknowledges that while Ximen豹 was effective ("dare not deceive"), his method was distinct from—and perhaps less ideal than—governance based on virtue or wisdom, yet it was exactly what the chaotic situation in Ye required.
