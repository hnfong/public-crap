This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

**Translation:**

Wei Wu Hou was planning something important and all his officials couldn't keep up. After leaving the council, he had a pleased expression on his face. Wu Qi approached him and said, "Is there someone who has heard the words of Chu Wang Zhuang from the left or right?" Wei Wu Hou replied, "What did Chu Wang Zhuang say?" Wu Qi responded, "Chu Wang Zhuang was planning something important and all his officials couldn't keep up. After leaving the council, he had a worried expression on his face. Then, Shen Gong Wu Chen asked, 'Why did the king have a worried expression when he was in council?' Chu Wang Zhuang replied, 'It's because I was planning something important and all my officials couldn't keep up. That's why I'm worried. The saying goes, "When a lord has a teacher, he becomes king; when he has a friend, he becomes hegemon; when he has doubts, he becomes preserved; but when he is unmatched by his own plans, he perishes." Now, since I lack virtue and all my officials can't keep up, how can our country avoid perishing?' Therefore, I'm worried.' Chu Wang Zhuang worried because of this, while you are pleased. Wei Wu Hou hesitated and bowed twice, saying, "Heaven is making Mr. Wu correct my mistakes."

**Moral of the story:**

The moral of the story is that a wise leader should be humble and aware of their own limitations, rather than overconfident and pleased with themselves. Chu Wang Zhuang, as a wise leader, recognizes that he lacks virtue and that his officials are unable to keep up with his plans, which fills him with worry and concern for the future of his country. In contrast, Wei Wu Hou is overconfident and pleased with himself, unaware of his own limitations and the potential dangers that lie ahead. The story warns against the dangers of hubris and the importance of humility and self-awareness in leadership.

**Counterpart in Western thought:**

The concept of the story, particularly the idea that a leader should be humble and aware of their own limitations, has a counterpart in Western thought. For example, the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote about the importance of humility and the need for leaders to recognize their own limitations in his work "Politics." Similarly, the idea that a leader should be concerned with the well-being of their people rather than just their own power and prestige is a central theme in the Western tradition of political thought, as seen in the works of thinkers such as Plato, Cicero, and Machiavelli.<|eot_id|>
