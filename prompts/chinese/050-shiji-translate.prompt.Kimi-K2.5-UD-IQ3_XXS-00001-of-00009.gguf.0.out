《Biography of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang》

Zhang Tingwei Shizhi was a man of Duyang, with the style name Ji. He had an elder brother named Zhong with whom he lived together. By virtue of his property qualification he became a Cavalry Gentleman, serving Emperor Xiaowen. For ten years he received no promotion and was unknown. Shizhi said: "Long service in office diminishes Zhong's property; I am unsuccessful." He wished to resign and return home. The Gentleman of the Palace Yuan Ang knew his worth and regretted his departure, so he requested that Shizhi be transferred to fill a vacancy as Herald. After Shizhi had finished his court audience, he took the opportunity to speak of matters of immediate benefit. Emperor Wen said: "Keep it low, do not speak of lofty matters, but what can be implemented today." Thereupon Shizhi spoke at length of matters between Qin and Han, why Qin lost and why Han rose. Emperor Wen praised him well and appointed Shizhi as Herald Commandant.

Shizhi accompanied the Emperor on a journey, ascending the Tiger Enclosure. The Emperor asked the Shanglin Commandant about the registers of various birds and beasts, more than ten questions. The Commandant looked left and right, completely unable to answer. The Steward of the Tiger Enclosure answered from the side on behalf of the Commandant, very thoroughly, on all the Emperor's questions about the registers of birds and beasts, wishing to display his ability to respond orally without limit. Emperor Wen said: "Should not officials be like this? The Commandant is worthless!" He then ordered Shizhi to appoint the Steward as Shanglin Commandant. Shizhi stepped forward after a long pause and said: "What sort of man does Your Majesty consider Marquis Jiang Zhou Bo to be?" The Emperor said: "A man of virtue." He asked again: "What sort of man does Your Majesty consider Marquis Dongyang Zhang Xiangru to be?" The Emperor again said: "A man of virtue." Shizhi said: "Marquis Jiang and Marquis Dongyang are called men of virtue. These two men could not even get words out when speaking of affairs. How could they emulate this Steward's chattering, sharp tongue, and quick responses! Moreover, Qin employed clerks who wielded the knife and brush; officials competed to be regarded highly for being harsh, severe, and meticulous, yet their harm was merely formalistic, without the substance of compassion. Therefore they did not hear of their faults, declining until the Second Emperor, when the empire collapsed like a landslide. Now if Your Majesty promotes this Steward beyond his rank because of his oral eloquence, I fear the empire will follow the wind and fall, competing to be orally eloquent without substance. Moreover, those below transform those above faster than shadow and echo; actions cannot but be examined carefully." Emperor Wen said: "Good." He then stopped and did not appoint the Steward.

The Emperor mounted his carriage and summoned Shizhi to ride with him, proceeding slowly, and asked Shizhi about the faults of Qin. He answered with complete honesty. When they reached the palace, the Emperor appointed Shizhi as Chief of the Public Carriages.

Shortly thereafter, the Crown Prince and the King of Liang entered the court together in one carriage, not dismounting at the Sima Gate. Thereupon Shizhi pursued and stopped them, not allowing the Crown Prince and King of Liang to enter the palace gate. He then impeached them for not dismounting at the public gate, an act of disrespect, and submitted this to the Emperor. Empress Dowager Bo heard of this. Emperor Wen removed his cap and apologized, saying: "I have been remiss in teaching my sons." Empress Dowager Bo then sent a messenger with an edict pardoning the Crown Prince and King of Liang, after which they were allowed to enter. Emperor Wen therefore regarded Shizhi as remarkable and appointed him as Grandee of the Palace.

Shortly thereafter, he rose to Gentleman of the Palace. He accompanied the Emperor on a journey to Baling, residing at the northern privy. At this time Lady Shen followed, and the Emperor pointed out to her the Xinfeng road, saying: "This is the road to Handan." He had Lady Shen play the se, and leaning on the se himself, he sang, his thoughts mournful and sorrowful. Looking at the assembled ministers, he said: "Alas! If I take the stones of the northern mountains for my outer coffin, use ramie floss chopped and spread, and glue it with lacquer in between, could it be moved?" Those around him all said: "Good." Shizhi stepped forward and said: "If there is something within that can be desired, even if you encase it in the southern mountains there would still be a gap; if there is nothing within that can be desired, even without stone coffins, what sorrow would there be!" Emperor Wen praised him well. Afterwards he appointed Shizhi as Tingwei.

Shortly thereafter, the Emperor was traveling out and crossing the Zhongwei Bridge, when a man ran out from under the bridge, startling the horses of the imperial carriage. The Emperor sent cavalry to arrest him and turned him over to the Tingwei. Shizhi interrogated him. The man said: "I am a man from the county, coming here. Hearing the warning of the imperial procession, I hid under the bridge. After a long time, I thought the procession had passed, so I came out. Seeing the imperial carriage and cavalry, I ran." The Tingwei reported his judgment: one offense of startling the imperial procession, punishable by fine. Emperor Wen angrily said: "This man personally startled my horses. Fortunately my horses are gentle; if they had been other horses, would they not certainly have injured me? Yet the Tingwei judges it a fine!" Shizhi said: "The law is what the Son of Heaven shares in common with all under Heaven. Now the law is thus, yet to make it heavier would be to make the law untrustworthy to the people. Moreover, at the very moment it happened, if Your Majesty had immediately executed him, that would have been that. Now that it has been sent down to the Tingwei—the Tingwei is the balance of all under Heaven—if it tilts once, then all under Heaven will use the law with arbitrary severity or leniency; where will the people place their hands and feet? I beg Your Majesty to consider this." After a long while, the Emperor said: "The Tingwei's judgment is correct."

After this, someone stole a jade ring from before the seat in the Gao Temple. He was captured, and Emperor Wen, in anger, sent him down to the Tingwei for judgment. Shizhi examined the law: theft of ritual vessels from the ancestral temple, and reported his judgment as execution by exposure in the marketplace. The Emperor was greatly enraged and said: "This man's lack of principle—he stole vessels from the temple of the former Emperor. I sent him to the Tingwei wishing to have his clan exterminated, yet you judge him according to the law. This is not what I intend in jointly upholding the ancestral temple." Shizhi removed his cap and knocked his head in apology, saying: "The law is sufficient thus. Moreover, when crimes are equal, they are yet differentiated by their degree of opposition or compliance. Now to exterminate the clan for stealing from the ancestral temple—suppose, in one ten-thousandth of a case, that foolish people took a handful of earth from Changling, how would Your Majesty increase the punishment?" After a long time, Emperor Wen spoke of this with the Empress Dowager, and then approved the Tingwei's judgment. At this time, the Commandant of the Capital Tiaohou Zhou Yafu and the Chancellor of Liang Shanduhou Wang Tiankai saw that Shizhi held his judgments fairly, and so became his close friends. Zhang Tingwei was thereby praised throughout the empire.

Later, when Emperor Wen died and Emperor Jing was established, Shizhi was fearful and claimed illness. He wished to resign and leave, fearing that great punishment would come; he wished to appear and apologize, but did not know how it would go. Using Wang Sheng's plan, he finally appeared to apologize, and Emperor Jing did not blame him.

Wang Sheng was skilled in speaking of Huang-Lao, a recluse. He was once summoned to reside in the court; the Three Excellencies and Nine Ministers were all assembled and standing. Wang Sheng, an old man, said "My socks are loose," and turned to Zhang Tingwei: "Tie my socks for me!" Shizhi knelt and tied them. When it was done, someone said to Wang Sheng: "Why alone did you humiliate Zhang Tingwei in court, making him kneel to tie your socks?" Wang Sheng said: "I am old and lowly; I estimate that I will ultimately be of no benefit to Zhang Tingwei. Zhang Tingwei is today a famous minister of the empire. I therefore humiliated the Tingwei a bit, making him kneel to tie my socks, wishing thereby to give him weight." When the various nobles heard this, they regarded Wang Sheng as worthy and gave weight to Zhang Tingwei.

Zhang Tingwei served Emperor Jing for slightly more than a year, then became Chancellor to the King of Huainan, still because of his former fault. After a long time, Shizhi died. His son was named Zhang Zhi, style name Changgong, who rose to Grandee and was dismissed. Because he could not accommodate himself to the age, he ended his life without serving in office.

Feng Tang—his great-grandfather was a man of Zhao. His father moved to Dai. When Han rose, he moved to Anling. Tang was renowned for filial piety and became Chief of the Gentlemen of the Palace, serving Emperor Wen. Emperor Wen passed by in his carriage and asked Tang: "Elder, why are you a Gentleman? Where is your home?" Tang answered completely with the truth. Emperor Wen said: "When I resided in Dai, my Palace Provisioner Gao Qu often spoke to me of the worth of the Zhao general Li Qi, who fought below Julu. Now at every meal, my thoughts have never left Julu. Do you know of him?" Tang answered: "He is not as good as Lian Po or Li Mu as generals." The Emperor said: "Why?" Tang said: "When my great-grandfather was in Zhao, he was a commandant and general, and was friendly with Li Mu. My father formerly was Chancellor of Dai, and was friendly with the Zhao general Li Qi, and knew his character." The Emperor, having heard of the character of Lian Po and Li Mu, was greatly pleased, and slapping his thigh said: "Alas! If only I could have had Lian Po and Li Mu as my generals, how could I worry about the Xiongnu!" Tang said: "Your servant! Though Your Majesty obtained Lian Po and Li Mu, you could not employ them." The Emperor was angry, rose, and entered the inner chambers. After a long time, he summoned Tang and rebuked him: "Why did you humiliate me before the multitude? Could you not have found a private place?" Tang apologized: "This rustic does not know what is forbidden."

At this time, the Xiongnu had newly made a great incursion into Chaona, killing the Commandant of Beidi, Ang. The Emperor had the Hu raiders on his mind, and so finally asked Tang again: "How do you know I could not employ Lian Po and Li Mu?" Tang answered: "I have heard that in ancient times, when kings sent forth generals, they knelt and pushed the wheel, saying: 'Within the threshold, I control; without the threshold, the general controls.' Military merit, titles, and rewards were all decided without, and reported upon return. This is not empty words. My great-grandfather said that when Li Mu was Zhao's general guarding the frontier, the taxes from the military market were all used by him to feast his soldiers; rewards and gifts were decided without, without interference from the center. Entrusting him and demanding success, therefore Li Mu was able to fully employ his wisdom and ability, dispatching selected chariots of 1,300, drawn bows and cavalry of 13,000, and soldiers worth a hundred gold of 100,000. Thereby he drove the Chanyu northward, defeated the Donghu, destroyed Danlin, suppressed mighty Qin to the west, and held off Han and Wei to the south. At that time, Zhao nearly achieved hegemony. Afterwards, it happened that King Qian of Zhao was established; his mother had been a singing girl. When King Qian was established, he employed the slander of Guo Kai, and finally executed Li Mu, ordering Yan Ju to replace him. Thereby the army was defeated and soldiers fled, and Zhao was captured and destroyed by Qin. Now I have privately heard that Wei Shang is Governor of Yunzhong, and that he uses all the military market taxes to feast his soldiers, spending his private funds for support, slaughtering an ox every five days to feast guests, military officials, and retainers. Therefore the Xiongnu avoid him from afar, not approaching the Yunzhong frontier. The raiders once entered; Shang led chariots and cavalry to attack them, killing many of them. Now soldiers are all sons of families, rising from the fields to join the army—how would they know of foot-soldier registers and squad tallies? Fighting with all their strength all day, beheading enemies and capturing prisoners, they report merit to the commander's office. If one word does not correspond, clerical officials punish them by law. Their rewards are not granted, yet officials enforce the law without fail. I am foolish, and consider that Your Majesty's laws are too clear, rewards too light, and punishments too heavy. Moreover, the Governor of Yunzhong, Wei Shang, was charged with a discrepancy of six levels in reporting enemy heads captured; Your Majesty sent him down to the clerks, stripped his noble rank, and punished him with labor. Speaking from this, though Your Majesty obtained Lian Po and Li Mu, you could not employ them. I am truly foolish, having touched upon what is forbidden—death crime, death crime!" Emperor Wen was pleased. That day he ordered Feng Tang to bear the staff of authority and pardon Wei Shang, restoring him as Governor of Yunzhong, and appointed Tang as Commandant of Chariots and Cavalry, in charge of the chariot soldiers of the Commandant of the Capital and the commanderies and kingdoms.

In the seventh year, Emperor Jing was established, and appointed Tang as Chancellor of Chu; he was dismissed. When Emperor Wu was established, he sought men of worth and excellence, and recommended Feng Tang. Tang was then over ninety years old and could not serve again in office, so he made Tang's son Feng Sui a Gentleman. Sui, style name Wangsun, was also a remarkable man, and was friendly with me.

The Grand Historian says: Zhang Ji's words on men of virtue, upholding the law without bending to the Emperor's will; Lord Feng's discourse on generals—flavorful indeed! Flavorful indeed! The saying goes: "If you do not know the man, look at his friends." What these two gentlemen praised and recited can be displayed in the ancestral temple. The Documents say: "Without partiality, without partisanship, the royal way is broad and vast; without partisanship, without partiality, the royal way is peaceful and easy." Zhang Ji and Lord Feng approached this. [end of text]
