According to historical records and legends, Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of China, had a family, but his family life was marked by tragedy and instability.

Qin Shi Huang was born to Zhuang Ji, a king of the Qin state, and his wife, Queen Xiao Zhuan. His birth name was Ying Zhuan. His father, Zhuang Ji, died when Qin Shi Huang was just a child, and his mother, Queen Xiao Zhuan, was taken away by his uncle, King Wu of Qin, who later became the king of Qin.

Qin Shi Huang's early life was tumultuous. He was forced to flee his homeland and seek refuge in the mountains, where he lived a nomadic life, surviving on wild fruits and berries. He was eventually discovered by a group of traveling merchants, who took him in and raised him as their own.

As he grew older, Qin Shi Huang became determined to reclaim his rightful place as the ruler of Qin and eventually united the various warring states to become the first emperor of a unified China.

As for his happiness during his childhood, it's difficult to say. Historical records provide limited information about his personal life, and it's likely that his early years were marked by hardship and uncertainty. However, it's worth noting that Qin Shi Huang's later life was marked by a desire for stability and order, which may have been influenced by his difficult childhood.

It's also worth noting that the concept of "happiness" during ancient Chinese times was different from what we understand today. In ancient China, the idea of "happiness" was often linked to achieving one's social status, fulfilling one's duty, and maintaining harmony within the family and the state.
