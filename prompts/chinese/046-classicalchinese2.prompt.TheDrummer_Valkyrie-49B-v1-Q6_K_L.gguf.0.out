(1) Translation:

Wu Hou of Wei was planning something and succeeded, and none of his ministers could match him. After the court session, he had a pleased expression. Wu Qi advanced and said: "Have you ever heard the saying of Chu Zhuang Wang from your attendants?" Wu Hou said: "What was Chu Zhuang Wang's saying like?" Wu Qi replied: "Chu Zhuang Wang planned something and succeeded, and none of his ministers could match him. After the court session, he had a worried expression. Shen Gong Wu Min advanced and asked: 'Your Majesty, why do you have a worried expression after the court session?' Zhuang Wang said: 'I planned something and succeeded, and none of my ministers could match me, that's why I'm worried. There is a saying in the middle of the mulberry field: "The feudal lords who can get a good teacher will become kings, those who can get a good friend will become hegemons, those who can get a doubtful one will survive, and those who can only rely on themselves and have no one better than themselves will perish." Now, with my unworthiness, and none of my ministers can match me, our country is almost destroyed! That's why I'm worried.' Chu Zhuang Wang was worried, but you are pleased." Wu Hou stepped back and bowed twice, saying: "Heaven sent you to correct my mistake."

(2) Moral of the story:
The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should be worried when he is too much better than his ministers, because it means he lacks good advisors and may make mistakes. A good ruler should surround himself with capable and honest ministers who can provide good counsel and prevent him from making errors. Being too superior to one's subordinates is a sign of weakness, not strength.

(3) Counterparts in Western thought:
The concept of a ruler being worried about being too superior to his ministers has counterparts in Western thought. For example:

- In Plato's Republic, Socrates argues that the ideal ruler should be a philosopher-king who surrounds himself with wise and virtuous advisors. If the ruler is too superior, it may lead to tyranny.

- In Niccol√≤ Machiavelli's The Prince, it is advised that a prince should surround himself with wise and honest counselors, and be willing to listen to their advice. Being too superior can lead to isolation and poor decision-making.

- The idea that a leader should be worried about lacking good advisors is also reflected in the biblical story of King Solomon, who prayed for wisdom and surrounded himself with wise men.

In terms of the specific quote about the feudal lords and their relationships with teachers, friends, doubtful ones, and relying only on themselves, it has similarities with the Western concept of the "three types of friendships" described by Aristotle in Nicomachean Ethics: friendships based on utility, pleasure, and virtue. A ruler who only has friendships based on utility or pleasure may not have true friends who can provide honest counsel, leading to downfall. [end of text]
