Alright, I need to determine where this particular Chinese text comes from and provide the complete original paragraph. The text provided is:

"臣非非難言也，所以難言者：言順比滑澤，洋洋纚纚然，則見以為華而不實...."

First, I'll analyze the content and structure of the sentence to identify any clues that might indicate its origin. The text appears to be a formal statement, possibly from a historical document or a literary work. The use of archaic language and specific terminology suggests that it might be from an ancient Chinese text or a classic work.

Let's break down the sentence:

1. **"臣非非難言也"** - This seems to be a formal opening, possibly indicating a subject addressing a superior or authority figure.
2. **"所以難言者"** - This translates to "the reason why it is difficult to speak."
3. **"言順比滑澤，洋洋纚纚然"** - This part describes the manner of speech, suggesting that speaking smoothly and eloquently ("順比滑澤") leads to being perceived as "華而不實" (showy but lacking substance).
4. **"則見以為華而不實...."** - This concludes the thought, stating that such perception leads to being seen as superficial.

Given the formal tone and the critique of eloquent speech leading to a perception of superficiality, this could be referencing a philosophical or literary discussion on rhetoric and authenticity. It might be from a work that critiques the use of elaborate language without substance.

Considering historical Chinese texts, one that comes to mind is the "Zhuangzi" (莊子), an ancient Chinese philosophical text associated with the Daoist school. The "Zhuangzi" often discusses the limitations of language and the dangers of becoming trapped by superficial eloquence.

Another possibility is the "Analects of Confucius" (論語), where Confucius emphasizes the importance of substance over form. However, the language in the provided text seems more aligned with a more philosophical and possibly more free-flowing style, which aligns more closely with the "Zhuangzi."

Additionally, the term "華而不實" is a common idiom in Chinese, meaning "showy but lacking substance," which is often used to critique superficiality. This idiom is frequently found in various classical texts and philosophical discussions.

Given these considerations, it's plausible that the text is from the "Zhuangzi," where such critiques of eloquence and substance are common themes.

To confirm, I'll recall specific passages from the "Zhuangzi." One well-known passage discusses the limitations of language and how eloquent speech can sometimes obscure the truth or lead to misunderstandings. This aligns with the sentiment expressed in the provided text.

Furthermore, the structure of the sentence, with its emphasis on the difficulty of speaking in a way that avoids being perceived as superficial, is characteristic of the "Zhuangzi's" style of argumentation.

In conclusion, after analyzing the language, structure, and content of the provided text, it is most likely an excerpt from the "Zhuangzi," a significant work in Chinese philosophy that delves into the nature of language, truth, and the balance between form and substance.

這段文字出自《莊子》。原文段落如下：

"臣非非難言也，所以難言者：言順比滑澤，洋洋纚纚然，則見以為華而不實。"

這段話出自《莊子·外篇·至樂》篇，用來批評那些只重視言辭的華麗而不注重內容的說法，指出這樣的做法往往會被認為是表面功夫，缺乏實質性的內容。
