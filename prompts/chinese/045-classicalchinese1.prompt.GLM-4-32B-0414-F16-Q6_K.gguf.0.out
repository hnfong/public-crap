Q4: Sima Nao used both wits (pretending to wait for the witch's report) and force (ordering officials thrown into the river) to deal with the situation. (5 points)

Q5: Morality is debatable:
- From a utilitarian perspective, his actions saved many lives and improved the region, justifying the means.
- From a deontological perspective, forcing officials into the river was unjustified violence.
- From a legal perspective, he exceeded his authority.
- From a Confucian perspective, his ultimate goal of benefiting the people might be seen as virtuous, though his methods were harsh. (10 points)

Q6: The quote means:
- Zheng's Zi Chan governed through fairness, making people unable to deceive him.
- Shandufu's Zi Jian governed through moral influence, making people unwilling to deceive him.
- Ye's Sima Nao governed through strictness, making people afraid to deceive him.
The comment is fair as it highlights different governance styles based on ability and approach, though "who is most virtuous" depends on one's governance philosophy. (15 points) [end of text]
