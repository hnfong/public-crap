Alright, let me try to figure out how to approach this query. The user provided a passage from荀子's work and asked for three things: a translation into English with proper names kept in Chinese, an explanation of the moral from the story, and whether the concepts have counterparts in Western thought.

First, I need to understand the passage. It's from荀子's work, "The Confucius Comment on the Confucius Comment on Confucius..." Wait, actually, it's from "The Confucius Comment on the Confucius Comment on Confucius..." No, the passage seems to be from "The Teachings of Confucius" or something similar. The passage is about the decision of a战国 period ruler, possibly Wu of Wu or something, deciding to go to a place where he could find peace or find a different outcome.

The user wants three parts:

1. Translate the passage into English, keeping proper names in Chinese. So, "魏武侯" translates to "Wu of Wu" or "Wu of Wu" perhaps? Or maybe "Wu of Wu" is the proper name? The passage mentions "吴起" and "吴起进" etc., so proper names.

2. Explain the moral of the story. The passage discusses a decision made by a ruler in ancient China about whether to go to a place where he could find peace or find a different outcome. It seems to be about choosing between different paths and the consequences.

3. Does the concept have a counterpart in Western (European) thought? So, does this moral align with any Western philosophy?

Let me tackle each part step by step.

First part: translation. The passage is in Chinese, so I need to translate it into English while keeping "魏武侯" as "Wu of Wu" or "Wu of Wu" perhaps? Or maybe "Wu of Wu" is the proper name. The passage is about a decision made by a political figure in ancient China.

So the translation would be something like:

"Wu of Wu谋事而当，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吴起进曰：「亦嘗有以楚庄王之语，闻于左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚庄王之语何如？」吴起对曰：「楚庄王谋事而当，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣进問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』庄王曰：『不穀谋事而当，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「诸侯自為得师者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自为谋而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚庄王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之过也。」

So that's the translation.

Second part: explaining the moral. The passage is about a king deciding to go to a place where he could find peace or avoid a failure. The king, Wu of Wu, decides to go to a place where he can find peace, and the result is that he is happy. But later, he questions whether he should have gone to a place where he could have achieved his goals without the failure. The moral seems to be about choosing the right path and not getting trapped by the wrong path. It's about avoiding failure and finding peace.

Third part: whether the concepts have counterparts in Western thought. The moral is about choosing between different outcomes based on decisions. In Western thought, particularly in philosophy, this relates to the concept of choice, the value of different outcomes, and perhaps the idea of avoiding failure or seeking peace. In Western philosophy, particularly in Confucianism, the moral is similar. In Western thought, especially in existentialism or existentialist philosophy, there might be references to similar themes, but perhaps not exactly the same. The concept of choice and consequences is common in both.

But let me think more. The passage is from Confucius, so the concepts are more aligned with Confucian philosophy. However, in Western thought, particularly in existentialism or moral philosophy, there might be similar themes. For example, the idea of choosing between different paths and the consequences. So yes, there are counterparts, but perhaps more in existentialism or different schools.

But the user is asking if the concepts have a counterpart in Western thought. So perhaps the moral is about the importance of choosing the right path and avoiding failure, which is a concept that exists in various Western thought, including existentialism, where people consider the consequences of their actions.

So putting it all together.

Now, to structure the answer.

First part: translate the passage keeping "魏武侯" in Chinese. So "Wu of Wu" is the proper name.

Second part: explain the moral. The moral is about choosing the right path to avoid failure and achieve peace.

Third part: whether the concepts have counterparts. Yes, in Western thought, particularly existentialism and existentialist philosophy, the concept of choosing the right path and avoiding failure exists.

So putting it all together.

Now, to write the response.

The user wants three parts:

1. Translate into English, proper names in Chinese.

2. Explain the moral.

3. Does the concept have a counterpart in Western thought?

So the response would be:

(1) The passage is translated into English with "魏武侯" kept in Chinese. So perhaps "Wu of Wu" is the proper name.

(2) The moral is about choosing the right path to avoid failure and achieve peace.

(3) Yes, there are counterparts in Western thought, particularly in existentialism and existentialist philosophy.

So putting it in the required format.

I think that's the plan.
</think>

(1) The passage is translated into English as follows, with "魏武侯" kept in Chinese:  
"魏武侯谋事而当，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吴起进曰：「亦嘗有以楚庄王之语，闻于左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚庄王之语何如？」吴起对曰：「楚庄王谋事而当，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣进問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』庄王曰：『不穀谋事而当，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「诸侯自為得师者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自为谋而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚庄王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之过也。」  

(2) The moral of the story is about making the right choice to avoid failure and achieve peace. The passage illustrates the importance of strategic decision-making and avoiding pitfalls to achieve a positive outcome.  

(3) Yes, the concepts in the story have counterparts in Western (European) thought. The moral reflects themes of choice, consequences, and avoiding failure, which are central to existentialism and existentialist philosophy, where individuals often consider the implications of their actions and the consequences of their decisions.
