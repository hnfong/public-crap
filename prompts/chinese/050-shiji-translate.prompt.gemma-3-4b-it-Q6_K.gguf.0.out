《張釋之馮唐列傳》

Zhang Tingzhi’s biography of Feng Tang recounts that Zhang Jinshi, from Duoyang, was surnamed Ji. His elder brother, Zhang Zhongtong, resided there. He was appointed as a Rider under Emperor Xiaowen, serving for ten years without gaining recognition. Zhang Jinshi stated, “Long years of service diminish Zhongtong’s gains, and he has not fulfilled his potential.” He wished to return home. Yuan Ang, who was then a Lieutenant, knowing Zhang Jinshi’s merit, was saddened by his departure and petitioned the Emperor to transfer Zhang Jinshi to the position of Assistant to the Imperial Edict.

Upon Zhang Jinshi’s arrival and presentation of his affairs, the Emperor said, “You are not too high-minded; let you proceed with your duties now.” Thus, Zhang Jinshi spoke about events from the Qin and Han dynasties. He explained that the fall of the Qin and the rise of the Han occurred over a long period. The Emperor praised him, and then appointed Zhang Jinshi as Assistant to the Imperial Edict.

Zhang Jinshi accompanied the Emperor on a trip to the Tiger Cage. He questioned the Imperial Forest Warden’s records of animals and officials, asking more than ten questions, but the Warden and his attendants were unable to answer. The Imperial Forest Warden’s assistant, acting on his behalf, provided a detailed account of the animals and officials, intending to demonstrate their ability to respond spontaneously. The Emperor said, “Is it proper for officials to do this? The Imperial Forest Warden is incompetent!” He then ordered Zhang Jinshi to appoint the assistant as Imperial Forest Warden.

Zhang Jinshi had previously commented, “What do you think of the Duke of Chen Zhou, Feng Bo?” The Emperor replied, “He is an old man.” He then inquired again, “How do you think of Zhang Shang?” The Emperor replied again, “He is an old man.” Zhang Jinshi said, “The Duke of Chen Zhou and the Duke of Dongyang are called ‘old men’; these two men were unable to speak when they served, how can you expect them to respond like this now?” The Emperor praised him. Afterwards, Zhang Jinshi was appointed as Imperial Historian.

Later, the Emperor traveled along the Middle Wei Bridge, and a man emerged from beneath the bridge, startling the Emperor’s horses.  Zhang Jinshi then ordered a mounted patrol to apprehend the man, and he was assigned to Zhang Jinshi as Imperial Historian. Zhang Jinshi administered the law. He said, “A man from the county came, concealed himself beneath the bridge, and waited a long time, thinking his journey was complete before emerging. He then saw the Emperor’s horses and the mounted patrol, and fled.” The Imperial Historian punished the man with a fine. The Emperor was furious and said, “This man startled my horses, and now the Imperial Historian is punishing him with a fine!” Zhang Jinshi replied, “Law belongs to the Emperor and is to be shared with the people. Since the law is like this and is being enforced more strictly, the law is not trusted by the people. At the time, the Emperor could have executed him immediately. Now that he has removed the Imperial Historian, the Imperial Historian is the standard for the entire country; if it is overturned, how can the people know how to act? Only you, Your Majesty, can discern this.” After a long pause, the Emperor said, “The Imperial Historian is correct.”

Subsequently, someone stole jade ornaments from the High Temple. They were caught, and the Emperor was furious, appointing Zhang Jinshi to administer the case. Zhang Jinshi presented the law regarding offenses against the ancestral temples and the imperial regalia. He recommended that the stolen items be publicly displayed for sale. The Emperor was enraged and said, “A person’s wickedness is to steal the relics of the previous emperor. Those entrusted to me to manage the Imperial Historian’s affairs intend to dispose of them, but you, Your Majesty, are using the law to deal with them, not what I would expect.” Zhang Jinshi knelt and prostrated himself, apologizing and said, “The law is like this; it is sufficient. Furthermore, the offenses are equal, but punishing them with a reversal of status is like a thousandfold. If a foolish commoner were to take a handful of earth from the Mausoleum of the Founding Emperor, what law would you apply to him?” After a long pause, the Emperor said, “The Imperial Historian is correct.”

Later, the Emperor and the Empress discussed Zhang Jinshi, and then permitted him to be reinstated as Imperial Historian. At that time, the Prince and the Prince of Liang were traveling in the Imperial Car and did not reach the Sir Lu Gate. Zhang Jinshi then stopped the Prince and Prince of Liang from entering the gate. He subsequently accused them of disrespecting the Emperor. The Empress Dowager, hearing this, apologized to the Emperor, saying, “Teach my son to be more cautious.” The Empress Dowager then ordered the case to be forgiven for the Prince and Prince of Liang, and they were then allowed to enter. The Emperor, impressed by Zhang Jinshi, appointed him as Chief Secretary.

Subsequently, Zhang Jinshi became a Lieutenant. He traveled with the Emperor to the Lingling area, residing near the north side of a latrine. At that time, Mrs. Shen accompanied the Emperor, and the Emperor instructed Mrs. Shen to travel the Xin Feng Road. He said, “This is the road to Handan.” He ordered Mrs. Shen to play the lute, and the Emperor listened, his expression somber, and then addressed the ministers, saying, “Behold! To build a coffin from north mountain stone, using rattan to wrap it and lacquer to finish it, how can it be moved?” All around him said, “It is good.” Zhang Jinshi stepped forward and said, “If there is anything within that can be desired, even if it is bound by the north mountain, there will be a way; if there is nothing that can be desired, even without a stone coffin, why should there be sorrow?” The Emperor praised him. Afterwards, Zhang Jinshi was appointed as Imperial Historian.

Later, the Emperor traveled along the Middle Wei Bridge, and a man emerged from beneath the bridge, startling the Emperor’s horses. Zhang Jinshi then ordered a mounted patrol to apprehend the man, and he was assigned to Zhang Jinshi as Imperial Historian. Zhang Jinshi administered the law.

The Emperor and the Empress discussed Zhang Jinshi, and then permitted him to be reinstated as Imperial Historian. At that time, the Chief Lieutenant Zhou Yaofu and the Minister of Liang Shan Dun Hou Wang Tian opened their eyes to witness Zhang Jinshi’s reasoned arguments. They then formed a close friendship. Zhang Jinshi was thus renowned throughout the empire as a meritorious official.

After the Emperor’s death, Emperor Jing ascended the throne, and Zhang Jinshi fell ill, claiming illness to resign. He feared severe punishment; he wished to apologize, but did not know if he would be allowed to. He used Wang Shen’s influence, and finally saw him, and Emperor Jing merely expressed his disapproval.

Wang Shen was skilled at expressing the teachings of Lao Tzu and was a respected scholar. He was summoned to serve as Imperial Historian. The Three Grand Secretaries and Nine Ministers were assembled, and Wang Shen, an old man, said, “Untie my belt.” He then addressed Zhang Jinshi, saying, “Tie my belt!” Zhang Jinshi knelt and tied his belt. After doing so, someone said to Wang Shen, “Why do you kneel to Zhang Jinshi, the Imperial Historian?” Wang Shen replied, “I am old and insignificant; I cannot benefit Zhang Jinshi. Zhang Jinshi is a meritorious official of the empire, and I humbly serve him, kneeling to tie his belt, in order to burden him.” The officials heard this and admired Wang Shen’s wisdom.

Zhang Jinshi served Emperor Jing for several years and was appointed as the Governor of the Western Regions. He continued to act in accordance with his earlier principles. Eventually, Zhang Jinshi died. His son, Zhang Zhi, surnamed Chang Gong, served as a Magistrate and was later demoted. He was unable to gain the Emperor’s favor, so he never held a high-ranking position.

Feng Tang was his great-grandfather, a man from Zhao. His father migrated to Dai. The Han Dynasty relocated him to Anling. Tang was known for his piety, and served as the Chief Secretary of the Imperial Office. He served Emperor Wen. Emperor Wen rode past and asked Tang, “Why do you serve as Chief Secretary? Where is your home?” Tang explained his situation truthfully. Emperor Wen said, “When I ruled in Dai, I was still a Supervisor of the High Office, and I had several people advise me on matters concerning the Zhao General Li Qi’s merits. I often thought about the Battle of Guandong. Now, when I eat, my thoughts are often with Guandong. Do you know this?” Tang replied, “Not as much as you, Your Majesty.” Emperor Wen said, “Do you know this?” Tang replied, “I heard that ancient rulers dispatched generals to the frontier, kneeling and pushing the wheel, to say that those within the region were to be controlled, and those outside were to be commanded. Military achievements and rewards were decided outside, and then reported to the Emperor. This is not a false statement.” Tang said that his great-grandfather, Li Qi, was a general of Zhao stationed on the border, and he used the market revenue to support his troops and rewards were decided outside, without interfering with the local affairs. He entrusted them with responsibility and allowed them to fulfill their duties. Therefore, Li Qi was able to achieve success, and he defeated the Xiongnu, broke the Eastern Hu, suppressed the Western Qiang, and supported the Han and Wei. At that time, Zhao was close to dominating the world. After that, King Zhao was transferred to the throne, and his mother initiated the transfer. When King Zhao was transferred to the throne, he used Guo Kai’s slander, and ultimately executed Li Qi, appointing Yan Ju to succeed him. Therefore, the army was broken, and the kingdom was captured by Qin. Now, I humbly hear that Wei is still governed by Yun Zhong, and their market revenue is used to support their troops and private sustenance, and they provide five oxen a week for guests, soldiers, and officials. Therefore, the Xiongnu avoid Yun Zhong’s area. When the Xiongnu attacked, they still led their horses to attack, killing many of their troops. The soldiers and their families are all fighting in the fields, and they do not know the value of a single measure of grain or a single official seal. They spend their days fighting, cutting off heads and capturing prisoners. The rewards are not given to them, and the officials use the law to punish them. Rewards are not given, and officials will enforce the law. I am foolish, and I think that the law is too strict, the rewards are too light, and the punishments are too severe. Furthermore, Yun Zhong is held accountable by Wei, and he has been demoted six levels for serving the Emperor, while the Emperor’s officials are demoted and punished. From this, it can be seen that the Emperor’s law is too strict.” Yun Zhong explained.

At that time, the Xiongnu, the Great Xiongnu, attacked and killed the Garrison Commander of Northern Territory. The Emperor was concerned about the barbarian incursions, and then asked Tang again, “How do you know that I cannot use Li Qi?” Tang replied, “I have heard that ancient rulers dispatched generals to the frontier, kneeling and pushing the wheel, saying that those within the region were to be controlled, and those outside were to be commanded. Military achievements and rewards were decided outside, and then reported to the Emperor. This is not a false statement.” Tang said that his great-grandfather, Li Qi, was a general of Zhao stationed on the border, and he used the market revenue to support his troops and rewards were decided outside, without interfering with the local affairs.
