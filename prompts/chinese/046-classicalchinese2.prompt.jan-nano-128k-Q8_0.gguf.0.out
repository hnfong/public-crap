Okay, I need to translate this passage from Xunzi into English. Let me start by reading through the original text carefully to understand the context and the key points.

First, the story is about Wei Wu侯 (Feng Wu Hou) who is successful in his planning and has a happy face after the meeting. Lü Ke (Wu Qi) advises him by comparing his situation to that of King Chu Zang Wang (Chu Zang Wang) from the past. The key part is that when Chu Zang Wang did something similar, he was worried because he realized that if he couldn't be surpassed by his ministers, his country might be in danger. So Wu Hou is being reminded that even if he's successful, he should be cautious because he might be overconfident.

Now, translating the names: "魏武侯" is Wei Wu Hou, "吳起" is Wu Qi, "楚莊王" is Chu Zang Wang, "申公巫臣" is Shen Gong Wuchen. I'll keep these in Chinese as they are proper names.

The first part: "魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。" So Wei Wu Hou planned something correctly, his ministers couldn't match his success, and he was happy after the meeting. Then Wu Qi says, "亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？" meaning "Have you ever heard the words of King Chu Zang Wang from your attendants?" 

Next, Wu Hou asks, "楚莊王之語何如？" and Wu Qi replies that Chu Zang Wang, when he planned something correctly, had a worried face. Then Shen Gong Wuchen asks why he was worried, and Chu Zang Wang explains that he was worried because he thought his country might be in danger if he couldn't be surpassed by his ministers. The quote from the "middle man" (maybe a mistranslation? The original says "中蘬之言" which might be "the words of the middle man" or "the words of the one in the middle" – perhaps a reference to a wise person or a proverb). The key line is "諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。" which translates to something like "Peoples who get a teacher will become kings, those who get a friend will become lords, those who get a doubt will survive, and those who plan alone and are not surpassed by others will perish."

So the moral is that even if you're successful, you should remain humble and cautious, because if you're not open to criticism or doubt, you might be in danger. It's about the importance of self-awareness and the dangers of overconfidence.

Now, for the Western counterpart: In Western thought, there's the idea of "pride leads to downfall" from Aristotle, or the concept of "hubris" in Greek tragedy. Also, the idea of "know thyself" from Socrates. Maybe also the Stoic philosophy that emphasizes self-awareness and the dangers of overconfidence. The quote from Chu Zang Wang is similar to the saying that "a leader must be open to criticism" or "a ruler should not be too confident in their own abilities." In the Bible, there's the story of King David being warned about the dangers of pride, like in 1 Samuel 16:7, where it says "The Lord looks at the heart, not at the appearance." So the moral is about humility and the need to remain vigilant even when successful.

**1. English Translation:**

Wei Wu Hou (Feng Wu Hou) successfully planned a matter, and none of his ministers could match his ability. After the meeting, he smiled with joy. Wu Qi (Wu Qi) approached and said: "Have you ever heard the words of King Chu Zang Wang (Chu Zang Wang) mentioned among your attendants?" Wei Wu Hou asked, "What did King Chu Zang Wang say?" Wu Qi replied: "When King Chu Zang Wang successfully planned a matter, his ministers could not match his ability, and he left the court with a worried expression. Shen Gong Wuchen (Shen Gong Wuchen) asked, 'Why did the king show worry?' Chu Zang Wang answered: 'I am worried because I have not found a teacher to guide me, and if I cannot be surpassed by my ministers, my country may soon fall into ruin. The saying of the middle man (possibly a reference to a proverb or a wise person) states: 'Peoples who find a teacher will become kings, those who find a friend will become lords, those who find a doubt will survive, and those who plan alone and are not surpassed by others will perish.' Now, I am not a worthy ruler, yet my ministers cannot match my ability. How can I be sure my country will not fall into ruin? Hence, I am worried.' King Chu Zang Wang was worried, but you are happy. Wei Wu Hou hesitated and bowed twice, saying: 'The heavens have sent you, Master Wu Qi, to correct my mistakes.'"

**2. Moral of the Story:**

The story teaches that even when one achieves success, they should remain humble and cautious. It warns against overconfidence, emphasizing that true wisdom lies in recognizing one's limitations and being open to criticism or doubt. King Chu Zang Wang's worry highlights the danger of self-pride, as he feared that his inability to be surpassed by his ministers might lead to the downfall of his kingdom. By comparing his own joy to Chu Zang Wang's worry, Wei Wu Hou learns the importance of self-awareness and the need to maintain humility in the face of success.

**3. Western Counterpart:**

Yes, the story resonates with several concepts in Western thought:  
- **Hubris**: A Greek concept where excessive pride leads to downfall. For example, in Greek tragedies, characters like Icarus or Oedipus fall because of their overconfidence.  
- **Aristotle’s Virtue Ethics**: Aristotle emphasized that pride (hubris) is a vice, while humility is a virtue. He argued that leaders must balance their confidence with self-awareness to avoid arrogance.  
- **Stoicism**: Stoic philosophers like Seneca stressed the importance of self-awareness and the dangers of overestimating one’s abilities. They advocated for leaders to remain open to criticism and to recognize their own fallibility.  
- **The Bible**: In 1 Samuel 16:7, it is stated, "The Lord looks at the heart, not at the appearance," which underscores the importance of humility and self-awareness.  
- **Socratic Wisdom**: The idea of "know thyself" (from the inscription at the Temple of Apollo) aligns with the story’s message that self-awareness is crucial for leadership.  

Thus, the story reflects Western philosophical ideas about the dangers of pride, the value of humility, and the necessity of self-criticism for effective leadership. [end of text]
