The Biography of Zhang Shi Zhi and Feng Tang  
Zhang Tingwei Shi Zhi was a man from Duyang, with the courtesy name Ji. He had an elder brother named Zhong, and they lived together. He became a cavalry attendant through wealth, serving Emperor Xiaowen, but for ten years he did not get a transfer, and was unknown. Shi Zhi said: “Being an official for a long time reduces Zhong’s property, and I have not succeeded.” He wanted to resign and return home. The Attendant General Yuan Ang knew his virtue, regretted his leaving, and so requested to transfer Shi Zhi to be a Yeshi. After Shi Zhi finished attending court, he took the opportunity to speak about matters of convenience. Emperor Xiaowen said: “Keep it low, do not make high theories, let it be something that can be implemented now.” Then Shi Zhi spoke about the events between the Qin and Han dynasties, about why the Qin fell and why the Han rose, for a long time. Emperor Xiaowen praised him, and so appointed Shi Zhi as Yeshi Puye.  
Shi Zhi followed the emperor on a journey, and climbed the tiger enclosure. The emperor asked the Shanglin尉 about the register of all birds and beasts, over ten questions, and the尉 looked around, could not answer at all. The tiger enclosure啬夫 answered from the side for the尉, responding to the emperor’s questions about the register of birds and beasts in great detail, wanting to show his ability to respond quickly and endlessly. Emperor Xiaowen said: “Should officials not be like this? The尉 is good for nothing!” He then ordered Shi Zhi to appoint the啬夫 as Shanglin Ling. Shi Zhi stepped forward and said: “What does Your Majesty think of Marquis Jiang Hou Zhou Bo?” The emperor said: “He is a man of virtue.” He then asked again: “What does Your Majesty think of Marquis Dongyang Hou Zhang Xiang Ru?” The emperor again said: “He is a man of virtue.” Shi Zhi said: “Marquis Jiang Hou and Marquis Dongyang Hou are called men of virtue, but these two men could not speak when they had matters to say, how could they imitate this啬夫, who is verbose and quick to respond? Moreover, the Qin dynasty relied on clerks with brushes and knives, and officials competed to be quick and strict, but the result was only formalities, no real compassion. Because of this, no one heard of their mistakes, and the dynasty declined until the Second Emperor, and the world collapsed. Now Your Majesty wants to promote this啬夫 because of his eloquence, I fear that the whole world will follow the wind, and compete to be eloquent without real virtue. Moreover, the lower follows the upper faster than shadow follows form, so one’s actions cannot be careless.” Emperor Xiaowen said: “Good.” He stopped and did not appoint the啬夫.  
The emperor went to his carriage, summoned Shi Zhi to ride with him, walked slowly, and asked Shi Zhi about the problems of the Qin dynasty. Shi Zhi spoke in detail. When they arrived at the palace, the emperor appointed Shi Zhi as Gongche Ling.  
After a while, the Crown Prince and Prince Liang rode in the same carriage to court, and did not get off at the Sima Gate. Shi Zhi chased after them and stopped the Crown Prince and Prince Liang from entering the palace gate. He then impeached them for not getting off at the public gate, which was disrespectful, and submitted the case. The Empress Dowager Bo heard about it, and Emperor Xiaowen took off his hat and apologized: “I did not teach my son well.” Empress Dowager Bo then sent an envoy to grant an imperial pardon to the Crown Prince and Prince Liang, and then they were allowed to enter. Emperor Xiaowen thus found Shi Zhi extraordinary, and appointed him as Zhongdafa.  
After a while, he became Zhonglangjiang. When he followed the emperor to Balin, he stayed in the north and looked at the toilet. At that time, Shenshuren was with him, and the emperor pointed to the Xin Feng road for Shenshuren, saying: “This is the road to Handan.” He made Shenshuren play the se, and leaned on the se to sing, with a sad and mournful mood. He looked at the ministers and said: “Alas! To use the stone from the northern mountain as a coffin, to stuff it with hemp and cut it into pieces, to seal it with lacquer in between, how could it be moved?” The attendants all said: “Good.” Shi Zhi stepped forward and said: “If there is something desirable inside, even if it is locked in the southern mountain, there will be a gap; if there is nothing desirable inside, even if there is no stone coffin, what is there to worry about?” Emperor Xiaowen praised him. Later, he appointed Shi Zhi as Tingwei.  
After a while, the emperor went out on the Zhongwei Bridge, and a man came out from under the bridge, and the emperor’s horse was startled. The emperor then sent riders to catch him, and handed him over to the Tingwei. Shi Zhi investigated and asked. The man said: “I am a county man, heard the imperial procession, hid under the bridge. After a long time, I thought the procession had passed, so I came out, saw the emperor’s carriage and riders, and ran away.” The Tingwei submitted the case, saying that the man had violated the imperial procession, and should be fined. Emperor Xiaowen was angry and said: “This man personally startled my horse, my horse was lucky to be gentle, if it were another horse, would it not have hurt me? And the Tingwei only gave him a fine!” Shi Zhi said: “The law is something the Son of Heaven shares with the whole world. Now the law is like this, and if we make it heavier, the law will not be trusted by the people. Moreover, at that time, if the emperor had ordered to execute him immediately, that would have been enough. Now that he is under the Tingwei, the Tingwei is the balance of the world, if it tilts, then the whole world’s use of law will be light or heavy, and the people will not know where to put their hands and feet. I beg Your Majesty to consider it.” After a long time, the emperor said: “The Tingwei’s judgment is correct.”  
Later, someone stole a jade ring from the front of the High Temple, and was caught. Emperor Xiaowen was angry, and handed him over to the Tingwei for investigation. Shi Zhi cited the law, and submitted that the person who stole the temple’s ceremonial objects should be executed in the market. The emperor was very angry and said: “This man is without virtue, to steal the objects of the former emperor’s temple. I wanted the Tingwei to execute his family, but you used the law to submit, this is not what I meant to share the temple with.” Shi Zhi took off his hat and磕头 to apologize: “The law is sufficient as it is. Moreover, the crimes are equal, but the difference is in the order of right and wrong. Now, if we execute the family for stealing the temple’s objects, even if it is one in ten thousand, if a foolish person takes a handful of soil from the Maoling, what law would you add to him?” After a long time, Emperor Xiaowen discussed it with the Empress Dowager, and agreed to the Tingwei’s judgment. At that time, the Zhongwei, Marquis Zhou Ya Fu of Tiao Hou, and the Liang Chancellor, Marquis Wang Tian Kai of Shandu Hou, saw that Shi Zhi’s opinions were fair, and became friends with him. Zhang Tingwei was thus praised by the whole world.  
After Emperor Xiaowen died, Emperor Jingdi took the throne, and Shi Zhi was afraid, and claimed to be sick. He wanted to resign, fearing a great punishment; he wanted to apologize, but did not know how. He used Wang Sheng’s plan, and finally apologized, and Emperor Jingdi did not blame him.  
Wang Sheng was a man who was good at Huanglao philosophy, a recluse. He was once summoned to stay in the court, and the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers were all present. Wang Sheng, an old man, said: “My socks are off,” and looked at Zhang Tingwei and said: “Tie my socks for me!” Shi Zhi knelt and tied them. After that, someone told Wang Sheng: “Why did you humiliate Zhang Tingwei in court, making him kneel to tie your socks?” Wang Sheng said: “I am old and lowly, I think I will never be of use to Zhang Tingwei. Zhang Tingwei is now a famous minister of the world, so I deliberately humiliated the Tingwei, making him kneel to tie my socks, to make him more respected.” The ministers heard this, and found Wang Sheng virtuous and respected Zhang Tingwei.  
Zhang Tingwei served Emperor Jingdi for over a year, as Chancellor of the Huai Nan Wang, and still had the previous mistake. After a long time, Shi Zhi died. His son was Zhang Zhi, with the courtesy name Changgong, who became a doctor, but was dismissed. Because he could not please the world, he never held office for his whole life.  
Feng Tang was a man whose grandfather was from Zhao. His father moved to Dai. After the Han dynasty was established, he moved to Anling. Tang was famous for filial piety, and was the head of the Zhonglang Bureau, serving Emperor Xiaowen. When the emperor passed by in his carriage, he asked Tang: “Old man, why are you a郎? Where is your home?” Tang answered truthfully. Emperor Xiaowen said: “When I was in Dai, my food supervisor Gao Qu often spoke to me about the virtue of Zhao’s general Li Qi, who fought under Julu. Now every time I eat, my mind is still at Julu. Do you know about it?” Tang answered: “It is still not as good as廉颇 and Li Mu as generals.” The emperor said: “Why?” Tang said: “My grandfather was in Zhao, was an officer (soldier) [commander], and was good friends with Li Mu. My father was the former Chancellor of Dai, was good friends with Zhao’s general Li Qi, and knew his character.” After the emperor heard about廉颇 and Li Mu’s character, he was very pleased, and hit his thigh and said: “Alas! I wish I could have廉颇 and Li Mu as my generals at this time, then I would not worry about the Huns!” Tang said: “Minister! Even if Your Majesty gets廉颇 and Li Mu, you cannot use them.” The emperor was angry, stood up and went into the palace. After a long time, he summoned Tang and scolded him: “Why did you humiliate me in front of the crowd? Could you not find a private place?” Tang apologized: “I am a vulgar man who does not know taboos.”  
At that time, the Huns had just invaded Chaona in large numbers, and killed the Northern Land尉 Ang. The emperor was concerned about the Hu寇, and finally asked Tang again: “How do you know I cannot use廉颇 and Li Mu?” Tang answered: “I have heard that in ancient times, when the Son of Heaven sent generals, he knelt and pushed the cart, and said: Within the gate, I control it; outside the gate, the general controls it. Military merit and rewards are decided outside, and then reported back. This is not an empty word. My grandfather said that Li Mu was a Zhao general on the border, and used all the market taxes to feed the soldiers, and decided rewards outside, without interference from the center. He was entrusted with responsibility and asked for results, so Li Mu could use all his intelligence, selected 1300 chariots, 13,000 bowmen, and 100,000 soldiers with 100 gold, so he drove the Xiongnu north, broke the Donghu, destroyed Danlin, suppressed the strong Qin in the west, and resisted Han and Wei in the south. At that time, Zhao was almost a hegemon. Later, when Zhao Wang Qian took the throne, his mother was a singer. When Wang Qian took the throne, he used Guo Kai’s slander, and finally executed Li Mu, and made Yan Ju replace him. So the army was defeated, the soldiers were driven north, and Zhao was captured and destroyed by the Qin. Now I have heard that Wei Shang is the governor of Yunzhong, and uses all the market taxes to feed the soldiers, [spends] private money to raise cattle, feeds guests, officers, and clerks every five days, so the Huns avoid Yunzhong, and do not approach the pass. When the enemy once entered, Shang led the chariots and cavalry to attack, and killed many of them. The soldiers are all sons of farmers, who came from the fields to join the army, how would they know about the register of soldiers. They fought all day, killed enemies and captured prisoners, and submitted their merits to the general, but one word did not respond, and the clerks used the law to punish them. The rewards do not go through, but the law is enforced. I think Your Majesty’s law is too strict, the rewards are too light, and the punishments are too heavy. Moreover, the Yunzhong governor Wei Shang was punished for being six levels short in reporting enemy prisoners, Your Majesty handed him over to the officials, stripped his title, and made him do labor. From this, Your Majesty cannot use廉颇 and Li Mu even if you get them. I am foolish, touched taboos, and I am guilty, guilty!” Emperor Xiaowen was pleased. That day he ordered Feng Tang to hold a token to pardon Wei Shang, made him the governor of Yunzhong again, and appointed Tang as Chaji Duwei, in charge of the Zhongwei and the chariots of the provinces.  
Seven years later, Emperor Jingdi took the throne, and appointed Tang as Chancellor of Chu, but he was dismissed. When Emperor Wudi took the throne, he sought virtuous men, and recommended Feng Tang. Tang was over ninety years old at that time, and could not serve as an official, so he appointed Tang’s son Feng Sui as a郎. Sui’s courtesy name was Wangsun, also an extraordinary man, and was friends with me.  
The Grand Historian said: Zhang Ji’s words about men of virtue, upholding the law without bending to the emperor’s will; Feng Gong’s discussion about generals, how meaningful! How meaningful! The saying goes: “If you do not know a person, look at his friends.” The two men’s praises can be recorded in the hall of the temple. The Book says: “Not biased, not partisan, the way of the king is broad; not partisan, not biased, the way of the king is smooth.” Zhang Ji and Feng Gong are close to this. [end of text]
