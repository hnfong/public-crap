"Zhang Shi's Biography of Feng Tang"
Zhang Tingwei Shi, from Duyang, with the character Ji. He had an elder brother, Zhong Tong. He was appointed as a riding official, serving Emperor Xiaowen, but for ten years he was not given a position, and was not well known. Shi said, "Long-term service will reduce the property of Zhong, and it will not be fulfilled." He wanted to resign and return. The middle general Yuan Ang knew his virtue and regretted his departure, so he requested to transfer Shi to be a visitor. After Shi had finished his morning court, he then spoke about matters of benefit. Emperor Xiaowen said, "Be humble, do not speak too highly, so that it can be implemented now." Therefore, Shi spoke about the matters between the Qin and Han dynasties, explaining why the Qin fell and the Han rose. Emperor Xiaowen praised him, and thus appointed Shi as the visitor's chief.
Shi followed the emperor, and climbed the tiger enclosure. The emperor asked the chief of the Upper Forest about the records of various animals, asking ten or so questions, and the chief looked around, and could not answer. The keeper of the tiger enclosure from the side took over and answered the emperor's questions about the animal records very well, wanting to see his ability to answer quickly and respond endlessly. Emperor Xiaowen said, "The officials should not be like this? The chief is a lazy person!" Then he ordered Shi to appoint the keeper as the chief of the Upper Forest. Shi had previously said, "Your Majesty, how do you think of Jiong Hou Zhou Bo?" The emperor said, "He is a mature person." Then he asked again, "How about Dongyang Hou Zhang Xiang?" The emperor replied again, "He is a mature person." Shi said, "Jiong Hou and Dongyang Hou are called mature people, but these two people when speaking could not even speak, how could they be like this keeper who is talkative and quick-witted? Moreover, the Qin dynasty used officials who were good at writing and clerical work, and the officials competed to be quick and strict, but the result was only formalities, without real compassion. Therefore, they did not hear of their faults, and gradually declined to the second emperor, and the whole country collapsed. Now Your Majesty appoints this keeper because of his eloquence and promotes him, I fear that the whole country will follow the trend, and compete for eloquence without real ability. Moreover, the influence of the lower on the upper is faster than the shadow of the sun, and the measures taken cannot be taken without careful consideration." Emperor Xiaowen said, "Good." So he stopped from appointing the keeper.
The emperor got into the carriage, and called Shi to ride beside him, and slowly drove, and asked Shi about the drawbacks of the Qin dynasty. He gave a detailed answer. When they arrived at the palace, Emperor Xiaowen appointed Shi as the official of the public carriage.
A short time later, the prince and the Prince of Liang rode into the palace together, and did not enter the司马门. Therefore, Shi chased after the prince and the Prince of Liang and prevented them from entering the palace gate. Then he reported that they did not show respect to the public gate, and submitted the report. The thin太后 heard about it, Emperor Xiaowen removed his hat and apologized, saying, "I have failed to educate my son properly." The thin太后 then sent someone to carry the order to pardon the prince and the Prince of Liang, and then they were allowed to enter. Emperor Xiaowen thus regarded Shi as a remarkable person and appointed him as the middle official.
A short time later, he became the middle general. When they were traveling to the Ba陵, he lived in the north of the toilet. At that time, the cautious lady was with him, and the emperor pointed out the new Feng road to the cautious lady, saying, "This is the road to Handan." He made the cautious lady play the zither, and the emperor leaned on the zither and sang, feeling sad and melancholic, and looked at the ministers and said, "Alas! If we use the stone from the north mountain as a tomb, and use the silk and cotton to cut the coffin, and paint the inside with lacquer, how could it be moved?" The attendants all said, "Good." Shi said before, "If there is something desirable in it, even if it is locked in the mountain, there is still a gap; if there is nothing desirable in it, even if there is no stone tomb, what would be the worry?" Emperor Xiaowen praised him. Later, he was appointed as the chief justice.
A short time later, the emperor was traveling and passed over the Zhongwei Bridge, and a person came out from under the bridge, and the imperial carriage horse was startled. Therefore, the horsemen captured him and handed him over to the chief justice. Shi investigated the case. He said, "The county person came, heard the carriage, hid under the bridge. After a long time, he thought the carriage had passed, so he came out, and saw the imperial carriage and horsemen, so he ran away." The chief justice of Qin sentenced him, saying that one person who violated the carriage should be fined. Emperor Xiaowen was angry and said, "This person personally startled my horse, my horse is gentle and kind, if it were another horse, it would not be damaged. But the chief justice sentenced him to a fine!" Shi said, "The law is something that the emperor shares with the people. Now if the law is like this and we make it heavier, it is not credible to the people. Moreover, at that time, if the emperor had ordered him to be executed, that would have been enough. Now that he has been handed over to the chief justice, the chief justice is the standard of the country. If the chief justice is tilted, then the law of the whole country will be light or heavy, and the people will not know where to put their hands or feet. Only the emperor should consider this." After a long time, the emperor said, "The chief justice is right."
Later, someone stole the jade ring in front of the high temple. He was caught, and Emperor Xiaowen was angry, and handed him over to the chief justice for investigation. Shi followed the law, and reported that stealing the temple's official and ceremonial objects should be sentenced to death. Emperor Xiaowen was very angry and said, "A person's lack of morality, stealing the temple's objects, we who are the chief justices are supposed to execute him, but you report it according to the law, which is not what I intend to share the temple's heritage." Shi removed his hat and bowed to apologize, saying, "The law is like this, it is enough. Moreover, the crime is the same, but it is different because of the reverse and the order. Now if someone steals the temple's objects and is executed, it is like a millionth of a part. If an ignorant person takes a handful of soil from the Long陵, how would you deal with him?" After a long time, Emperor Xiaowen and the thin太后 talked about it, and then agreed to the chief justice's sentence. At that time, the chief of the military, Liu Yaofu, and the governor of the mountain of the Prince of Liang, Wang Tianshui, saw Shi's argument as fair, and thus became friends. Zhang Tingwei thus became famous throughout the country.
Later, Emperor Xiaowen died, and Emperor Jing took the throne. Shi was afraid, and claimed illness. He wanted to resign, fearing a major punishment; he wanted to apologize, but did not know how. He used the plan of Wang Sheng, and finally apologized, and Emperor Jing did not punish him.
Wang Sheng was a person who was good at the Yellow and Old doctrines, and a recluse. He once lived in the court, and all the three public officials and nine ministers gathered, and Wang Sheng, an old man, said, "My belt is loose." He turned to Zhang Tingwei and said, "Please tie my belt for me!" Shi knelt and tied it. After that, someone said to Wang Sheng, "Why did you humiliate Zhang Tingwei in the court, making him kneel to tie your belt?" Wang Sheng said, "I am old and poor, I think I will never be of benefit to Zhang Tingwei. Zhang Tingwei is now a famous official of the country. I therefore lightly humiliated Zhang Tingwei, making him kneel to tie my belt, to honor him." The ministers heard this, and regarded Wang Sheng as a virtuous person and respected Zhang Tingwei.
Zhang Tingwei served Emperor Jing for a year, and became the governor of Huainan. He still had the previous mistake. A long time later, Shi died. His son was Zhang Zhi, with the character Changgong, who reached the position of a scholar, but was dismissed. Because he could not please the world, he never held office.
Feng Tang was from the Hanzhong region. His father moved to Dali. The Han dynasty was established, and he was moved to Anling. Tang became famous for his filial piety, and became the chief of the middle official, serving Emperor Xiaowen. Emperor Xiaowen was passing through, and asked Tang, "How did you become a official? Where is your family?" Tang gave a detailed answer. Emperor Xiaowen said, "When I was in Dali, my chief cook, Gao Qu, often told me about the virtue of General Li Qi of Zhao, who fought at Juyan. Now every time I eat, I never forget Juyan. Do you know this?" Tang replied, "Not as good as Lian Po and Li Mu as generals." The emperor said, "Why?" Tang said, "My father was in Zhao, and was a general, who was good at Li Mu. My father was once the governor of Dali, and was good at General Li Qi of Zhao, and knew his character." The emperor had heard of the character of Lian Po and Li Mu, and was very pleased, and said, "Alas! If I had Lian Po and Li Mu as my generals, would I worry about the Xiongnu?" Tang said, "My Majesty! Even if you had Lian Po and Li Mu, you could not use them." The emperor was angry, got up and entered the palace. After a long time, he called Tang and scolded him, saying, "Why did you publicly insult me, and why did you not have a private place?" Tang apologized, saying, "I am a rude person and did not know the taboo."
At that time, the Xiongnu had newly invaded Chao Na, and killed the governor of Beidie, Wang. The emperor was concerned about the Xiongnu, and finally asked Tang again, "Why do you know that I cannot use Lian Po and Li Mu?" Tang replied, "I have heard that in ancient times, when the emperor sent generals, he would kneel and push the carriage, saying that within the city, it was the emperor's control; outside the city, it was the general's control. The military achievements and rewards were all decided outside, and then reported back. This is not empty talk. My father said that Li Mu was the general of Zhao, living on the border, the revenue from the military market was all used to feed the soldiers, the rewards were decided outside, not disturbed from the inside. He was entrusted and required to achieve success, so Li Mu was able to fully use his abilities, sending selected carriages of a thousand three hundred, and a thousand three hundred cavalry, and ten thousand soldiers with a hundred gold, so he could push the single, defeat the Donghu, destroy the Danlin, suppress the strong Qin to the west, and support the Han and Wei to the south. At that time, Zhao was almost a hegemon. Later, when the king of Zhao, Wang Qian, was established, his mother was a concubine. When Wang Qian was established, he used Guo Kai to spread rumors, and finally executed Li Mu, and appointed Yan Ju to take his place. Therefore, the army was defeated and the soldiers were defeated, and they were captured and destroyed by Qin. Now I have secretly heard that Wei Shang was the governor of Yunzhong, and his military market revenue was all used to feed the soldiers, and he also used his private money, and every five days he killed a cow to feed the guests, the military officials, and the attendants. Therefore, the Xiongnu avoided Yunzhong and did not come close to the border. When the Xiongnu once entered, Wei Shang led the cavalry to attack them, and killed many of them. The soldiers were all family sons who had started from the fields to join the army, how could they know the ranks and the symbols? They fought all day, killed enemies and captured prisoners, reported their achievements to the office, but if their reports did not match, the officials would use the law to punish them. The rewards were not given, but the officials strictly followed the law. I am foolish, thinking that the law is too clear, the rewards are too light, and the punishments are too heavy. Moreover, the governor of Yunzhong, Wei Shang, was sentenced for not reporting the number of enemies killed, and the emperor ordered the officials to punish him, and reduced his rank and made him work in prison. Therefore, if we say this, the emperor even if he had Lian Po and Li Mu, could not use them. I am truly foolish, and I have violated the taboo, and I am guilty of death, and I am guilty of death!"
Emperor Xiaowen was pleased. That day, he ordered Feng Tang to carry the imperial decree to pardon Wei Shang, and reappointed him as the governor of Yunzhong, and appointed Tang as the chief of the cavalry, in charge of the chief of the military and the carriages of the provinces and states.
Seven years later, Emperor Jing took the throne, and appointed Tang as the governor of Chu, and he was dismissed. Emperor Wu took the throne, and sought virtuous people, and recommended Feng Tang. Tang was over ninety years old at that time, and could not serve again, so he appointed his son, Feng Sui, as an official. Sui had the character Wangsun, and was also a remarkable person, and was friendly with me.
The historian said: Zhang Ji's words about the mature person, keeping the law without favoring the intention; Feng Gong's discussion about the generals, is it delicious! Delicious! It is said, "Do not know a person, look at his friends." The two gentlemen's praise can be recorded in the hall. The Book of Documents says, "Not biased, not party, the way of the king is broad; not party, not biased, the way of the king is convenient." Zhang Ji and Feng Gong are close to this. [end of text]
