### **(1) Translation of the Story into English**

**魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。**  
King Wei of Wei was deliberating on state affairs and made the right decisions, so that none of his ministers could match him. After court, he had a look of joy on his face.

**吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」**  
Wu Qi stepped forward and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu spoken to those around you?"

**武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」**  
King Wei replied, "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?"

**吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」』**  
Wu Qi replied, "King Zhuang of Chu, when he deliberated on state affairs and made the right decisions, yet after court had a look of worry on his face. Minister Shen Gong Wuchen asked, 'Your Majesty, why do you have a worried look after court?' The king replied, 'I, the unworthy one, deliberate on state affairs and make the right decisions, yet none of my ministers can match me. That is why I am worried. It is as the saying goes: "A ruler who has ministers who can be his teachers becomes a king; one who has ministers who can be his equals becomes a hegemon; one who has ministers who can be his doubts becomes a ruler who barely survives; one who deliberates alone and finds no one to match him will lose his state."'

**今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』**  
"Now, because I am unworthy, and none of my ministers can match me, my state is almost lost! That is why I am worried."

**楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。**  
King Zhuang of Chu was worried, but you, my lord, are joyful.

**武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」**  
King Wei stepped back and bowed twice, saying, "Heaven has sent you, my teacher, to correct my faults."

### **(2) Explanation of the Moral of the Story**

The moral of the story is a warning against **complacency in leadership**. It contrasts two rulers:

- **King Zhuang of Chu** is portrayed as a wise and humble ruler who, despite making excellent decisions, feels **deep concern** because he recognizes that no one around him can match his wisdom. This humility and awareness of his limitations lead to **wise governance and the preservation of his state**.

- **King Wei of Wei**, on the other hand, is **overjoyed** by his ministers' inability to match his decisions. This **arrogance** suggests that he believes his own judgment is superior and unchallengeable, which Wu Qi warns could lead to **downfall**.

The story teaches that **true leadership requires humility, openness to criticism, and the recognition that no ruler is infallible**. A ruler who surrounds himself with capable advisors and is willing to learn from them is more likely to succeed. Conversely, a ruler who believes he is always right and surrounds himself with yes-men is doomed to failure.

### **(3) Counterparts in Western (European) Thought**

Yes, the concepts in this story have clear counterparts in **Western political and philosophical thought**, particularly in **classical and early modern political theory**.

#### **1. The Wise and Humble Ruler (vs. the Arrogant Ruler)**
- **Plato’s Republic**: Plato’s philosopher-king is someone who seeks wisdom and is not swayed by personal glory. He rules not for power but for the good of the polis. Like King Zhuang, he is aware of his limitations and seeks truth.
- **Machiavelli’s *The Prince***: While Machiavelli emphasizes power and pragmatism, he also warns against rulers who become isolated or overconfident. A ruler who listens to advisors and is not deluded by flattery is more likely to survive.

#### **2. The Role of Advisors and the "Court of Truth"**
- **The concept of the "court of truth"** appears in **Montesquieu’s *The Spirit of the Laws*** and **Machiavelli’s *Discourses on Livy***. Both argue that a ruler must be surrounded by honest advisors who can speak truth to power, not just flatter.
- **The idea of the "wise counselor"** is also central in **Edmund Burke’s political thought**, where he emphasizes the importance of tradition, counsel, and gradual reform—rather than radical change based on personal whim.

#### **3. The Dangers of Solipsistic Rule**
- **John Stuart Mill’s critique of despotism** in *Considerations on Representative Government* warns that rulers who do not allow for dissent or challenge become tyrants. The Chinese phrase “自為謀而莫己若者亡” (“ruling alone without equals leads to downfall”) is echoed in Mill’s warning that **no single mind can govern well without the input of others**.

#### **4. The Confucian-Westerner Contrast**
- While Confucianism emphasizes **ritual, hierarchy, and moral cultivation**, Western thought often emphasizes **reason, debate, and institutional checks**. However, both traditions recognize that **humility and openness to counsel are essential for good governance**.

### **Summary**

| Aspect | Confucian (Chinese) | Western (European) |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **Ideal Ruler** | Humble, open to counsel | Wise, rational, accountable |
| **Danger** | Arrogance, isolation | Tyranny, despotism |
| **Solution** | Surround yourself with able advisors | Institutional checks, representative governance |
| **Moral** | Humility prevents downfall | Liberty and debate prevent tyranny |

Thus, while the **cultural frameworks differ**, the **core insight** is shared: **no ruler is infallible, and the survival of the state depends on humility, counsel, and the willingness to be corrected**. [end of text]
