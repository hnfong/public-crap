“Biographies of Zhang Shi zhi and Feng Tang”  

Zhang Shizhi, a native of Duyang, styled Ji, had an elder brother, Zhong, with whom he lived. He entered official service as a cavalry officer through family wealth, serving Emperor Xiaowen, but after ten years, he had not been promoted and remained unknown. Shizhi said: “My long tenure in office has diminished Zhong’s property, and I have made no progress.” He wished to resign and return home. The General of the Central Guards, Yuan Ang, recognized his talent and regretted his departure, so he requested that Shizhi be transferred to fill the post of *yèzhě* (attendant). After Shizhi completed his morning audience, he stepped forward to present convenient matters for state administration. Emperor Wen said: “Keep it down; avoid overly lofty theories—let it be something implementable in the present.” Thus, Shizhi discussed matters concerning the periods between Qin and Han, explaining why Qin fell and why Han rose, for a long while. Emperor Wen praised him and appointed Shizhi as *yèzhě púshè* (Director of Attendants).  

Shizhi accompanied the Emperor on a tour, ascending the Tiger Enclosure. The Emperor asked the Superintendent of the Imperial Park (Shànglín Wèi) about the register of birds and beasts, posing over ten questions. The Superintendent looked left and right, unable to answer any. A minor official (*sèfū*) standing nearby then stepped forward to answer all the Superintendent’s questions about the register thoroughly, intending to demonstrate his ability to respond fluently and endlessly. Emperor Wen said: “Should officials not be like this? The Superintendent is utterly unreliable!” He then ordered Zhang Shizhi to appoint the *sèfū* as Superintendent of the Imperial Park. Shizhi, after a long pause, said: “Your Majesty, what kind of man do you consider Jianghou Zhou Bo?” The Emperor replied: “A virtuous man.” Shizhi asked again: “What of Dongyang侯 Zhang Xiangru?” The Emperor replied again: “A virtuous man.” Shizhi said: “Jianghou and Dongyang侯 are called virtuous men; yet these two, when reporting matters, could barely utter a word—how could they imitate this *sèfū*, who chatters incessantly with a sharp tongue and swift replies? Moreover, Qin appointed clerks skilled in legal writing, and officials competed to outdo each other in harshness, speed, and scrutiny. Yet their flaw was merely formalities—lacking genuine compassion. Consequently, they never heard of their own faults, declined gradually, and reached the point where the Second Qin Emperor faced national collapse. Now, if Your Majesty promotes this *sèfū* for his eloquence, I fear the realm will follow like wind over grass, competing in eloquence without substance. Moreover, the people follow the ruler’s example faster than shadow follows form—actions and decisions must be carefully considered.” Emperor Wen said: “Well said.” He then stopped and did not appoint the *sèfū*.  

The Emperor boarded his carriage and summoned Shizhi to ride beside him, proceeding slowly, and asked Shizhi about the drawbacks of Qin. Shizhi gave a straightforward account. Upon reaching the palace, the Emperor appointed Shizhi as *gōngchē lìng* (Director of the Public Chariot Bureau).  

Soon after, the Crown Prince and Prince Liang entered the capital together in one carriage and failed to dismount at the *Sīmǎ Gate*. Shizhi therefore pursued and stopped them, preventing their entry through the palace gate. He then impeached them for disrespect by not alighting at the public gate and submitted the case. Empress Dowager Bo heard of it, and Emperor Wen removed his crown and apologized: “I failed to discipline my sons properly.” The Empress Dowager then dispatched an envoy to convey her edict, pardoning the Crown Prince and Prince Liang, after which they were allowed to enter. Emperor Wen thus esteemed Shizhi and appointed him as *zhōngdàfū* (Senior Attendant).  

Soon after, he was promoted to General of the Central Guards. Accompanying the Emperor to Bailing, they stopped north of the latrine. At that time, the favorite consort, Shenfu, accompanied them. The Emperor pointed to the road to Xinfeng and said to Shenfu: “This is the road to Handan.” He then had Shenfu play the *sè*, and he leaned on the instrument and sang himself, his mood deeply sorrowful and melancholy. He turned to his ministers and said: “Alas! If one were to use the stones of Beishan as a coffin, line it with ramie fiber, cut and pack it, and lacquer the gaps—could it ever be moved?” Those around all said: “Good.” Shizhi stepped forward and said: “If there were things within the tomb one could desire, even sealing the Nan Mountains would still leave a crack; but if there is nothing within one desires, then even without a stone coffin, what is there to grieve about?” Emperor Wen praised him. Thereafter, he appointed Shizhi as *tíngwèi* (Grand Judge).  

Soon after, the Emperor set out and passed over the Zhongwei Bridge, when a man emerged from beneath the bridge, startling the horses drawing the Emperor’s carriage. The Emperor ordered cavalry to capture him and deliver him to the *tíngwèi*. Shizhi investigated and interrogated him. The man said: “I am a county resident. Hearing the imperial procession, I hid beneath the bridge. After a long time, I thought the procession had passed, so I emerged—only to see the Emperor’s carriage and retinue, and fled immediately.” The *tíngwèi* ruled that one who violated the imperial procession (*bì*) should be fined gold. Emperor Wen angrily said: “This man personally startled my horses. My horses happened to be gentle; had it been other horses, would they not have certainly injured me? Yet the *tíngwèi* rules only for a fine!” Shizhi replied: “The law is what the Son of Heaven shares with the whole realm. If the law is thus, yet we now impose a heavier penalty, then the law loses credibility among the people. Moreover, at that moment, had the Emperor ordered immediate execution, it would have ended there. But now that the case has been referred to the *tíngwèi*, the *tíngwèi* is the standard of justice for the realm. If this is tilted, then the whole realm’s application of law will swing between leniency and severity—where will the people place their hands and feet? I beg Your Majesty to consider this.” After a long pause, the Emperor said: “The *tíngwèi*’s ruling is correct.”  

Later, someone stole the jade rings placed before the seat in the Ancestral Temple of Gaozu. The man was captured, and Emperor Wen, enraged, referred the case to the *tíngwèi*. Shizhi, according to law, prosecuted for theft of ritual objects of the ancestral temple, and ruled that the penalty should be public execution. The Emperor became furious and said: “This man is utterly unprincipled—he stole the ancestral temple vessels of the Former Emperor. I referred the case to the *tíngwèi* expecting the death penalty for his entire clan, yet you prosecute according to law—this is not how I wish to honor the ancestral temple!” Shizhi removed his crown, knocked his forehead on the ground, and apologized: “The law as applied is sufficient. Moreover, crimes of equal severity differ only in degree of rebellion or obedience. Now, if one steals ancestral temple vessels and is executed along with his clan, then if, in one out of ten thousand cases, a foolish commoner were to take a handful of soil from the Longling Mausoleum—what penalty would Your Majesty add?” After a long time, Emperor Wen discussed the matter with the Empress Dowager, and finally approved the *tíngwèi*’s ruling. At that time, the Captain of the Imperial Guards, Marquis of Tiaohou Zhou Yafu, and the Marquis of Shandu, Wang Tiankai, Prime Minister of Liang, saw that Shizhi maintained impartiality in judgment, and thus formed close friendship with him. Zhang Tingwei thus became renowned throughout the realm.  

After Emperor Wen’s death, Emperor Jing ascended the throne. Shizhi, fearing, feigned illness, wishing to resign and leave, yet feared severe punishment; he wished to appear and apologize, yet did not know how. Following Wang Sheng’s advice, he finally appeared to apologize, but Emperor Jing did not punish him.  

Wang Sheng was a scholar well-versed in Huang-Lao teachings, a recluse. Once summoned to reside in the palace, when the Three Excellencies and Nine Ministers were all assembled, Wang Sheng, an elderly man, said: “My sock strap is undone,” and turning to Zhang Tingwei, said: “Please tie it for me!” Shizhi knelt and tied it. Afterward, someone said to Wang Sheng: “Why did you publicly humiliate Zhang Tingwei, making him kneel to tie your sock?” Wang Sheng replied: “I am old and lowly; I realize I can no longer benefit Zhang Tingwei. Yet Zhang Tingwei is today a renowned minister of the realm. Thus, I temporarily humiliate him, making him kneel to tie my sock, hoping to enhance his prestige.” The high officials, upon hearing this, esteemed Wang Sheng and valued Zhang Tingwei.  

Zhang Tingwei served Emperor Jing for over a year, then became Chancellor of Huainan Kingdom, still due to past offenses. After a long time, Shizhi died. His son was Zhang Zhi, styled Changgong, who rose to the rank of *dàfū*, but was later dismissed for being unable to curry favor with the world—and thus never held office again.  

Feng Tang: his grandfather was from Zhao; his father relocated to Dai. After the Han’s founding, the family was relocated to Anling. Tang was renowned for filial piety and served as Director of the Central Guards’ Office, serving Emperor Wen. Once, Emperor Wen’s carriage passed by and asked Tang: “Elder, why did you become a *láng*? Where is your home?” Tang answered truthfully. Emperor Wen said: “When I resided in Dai, my Superintendent of Provisions, Gao Qu, often spoke to me of the Zhao general Li Qi’s excellence, especially his battle at Jùlù. Now, every time I eat, my thoughts are never far from Jùlù. Do you know him?” Tang replied: “He is still inferior to Lian Po and Li Mu as a general.” The Emperor asked: “Why so?” Tang said: “My grandfather, when in Zhao, served as a military commander and was close to Li Mu. My father, formerly Prime Minister of Dai, was close to Zhao’s general Li Qi and knew his character well.” Upon hearing of Lian Po and Li Mu’s character, the Emperor was greatly pleased and struck his thigh, saying: “Alas! Had I Lian Po or Li Mu as my generals, how could I fear the Xiongnu!” Tang said: “My Lord! Even if Your Majesty had Lian Po or Li Mu, he could not employ them.” The Emperor became angry, rose, and entered the inner court. After a long while, he summoned Tang and reproached him: “How could you publicly humiliate me—could you not have spoken privately?” Tang apologized: “Your servant is a rustic and knows no discretion.”  

At that time, the Xiongnu had just launched a major invasion of Chaona, killing the Governor of Beidi, Ang. The Emperor, concerned about the Hu raiders, finally asked Tang again: “How do you know I cannot employ Lian Po or Li Mu?” Tang replied: “I have heard that in ancient times, when kings dispatched generals, they knelt and pushed the axle of the chariot, saying: ‘Within the palace gates, the ruler decides; beyond the palace gates, the general decides.’ Military merit, ranks, rewards—all decided in the field, and reported upon return. This is no empty statement. My grandfather said: when Li Mu served as Zhao’s general on the frontier, he used all the revenues from military markets to reward his soldiers, and rewards were decided externally, without interference from the court. Entrusting him fully and demanding success, Li Mu was thus able to exhaust his wisdom and talent: he dispatched 1,300 chariots, 13,000 cavalry archers, and 100,000 elite warriors. Thus he drove northward the Xiongnu chanyu, defeated the Donghu, destroyed the Danlin, restrained the powerful Qin in the west, and held firm against Han and Wei in the south. At that time, Zhao nearly became hegemon. Later, when King You of Zhao, whose mother was a courtesan, ascended the throne, he listened to Guo Kai’s slander and ultimately executed Li Mu, appointing Yan Ju to replace him. Thus the army was defeated, soldiers fled, and Zhao was captured and destroyed by Qin. Now I privately hear that Wei Shang serves as Governor of Yuntong, using all the revenues from military markets to reward his soldiers, supplementing with his own salary, slaughtering an ox every five days to feast guests, officers, and retainers—hence the Xiongnu avoid the area and keep far from Yuntong’s frontier. Once, when the Xiongnu invaded, Wei Shang led chariots and cavalry to attack them, slaying many. The soldiers are all sons of common families, rising from the fields to join the army—how can they know the intricacies of military registers and unit tokens? After fighting hard all day, slaying enemies and capturing prisoners, submitting reports to headquarters—if one detail does not match, civil officials punish them according to law. Rewards are not granted, yet officials enforce the law rigorously. Your servant, though foolish, believes Your Majesty’s laws are too strict, rewards too light, and punishments too severe. Moreover, Governor Wei Shang of Yuntong was merely charged with an error of six headcounts in enemy casualties, and Your Majesty referred him to officials, stripped his rank, and punished him with penal labor. From this, if Your Majesty had Lian Po or Li Mu, he still could not employ them. Your servant, though truly foolish, has offended taboos—my crime deserves death, my crime deserves death!” Emperor Wen was pleased. That very day, he ordered Feng Tang to carry the imperial seal and pardon Wei Shang, restoring him as Governor of Yuntong, and appointed Tang as *chēqí dūwèi* (Commander of Chariot and Cavalry), in charge of the Captain of the Imperial Guards and the cavalry of the commanderies and kingdoms.  

In the seventh year, Emperor Jing ascended the throne, appointing Tang as Chancellor of Chu, but he was later dismissed. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne, he sought virtuous and talented men and recommended Feng Tang. Tang was then over ninety years old and could no longer serve in office, so he appointed Tang’s son, Feng Sui, as a *láng*. Sui, styled Wangsun, was also an extraordinary man and was on good terms with me.  

Grand Historian says: Zhang Ji’s words on virtuous men, upholding law without flattery; Feng Gong’s discourse on generals—how flavorful! How flavorful! As the saying goes: “To know a man, look at his friends.” The praises these two men extolled may be inscribed in the ancestral temple. The *Book* says: “Neither partial nor partisan, the Kingly Way is vast and open; neither partisan nor partial, the Kingly Way is straightforward.” Zhang Ji and Feng Gong drew near to this ideal.
