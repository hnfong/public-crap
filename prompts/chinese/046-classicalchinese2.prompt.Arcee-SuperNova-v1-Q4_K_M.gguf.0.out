Here are the requested analyses:

**(1) Translation:**

Marquis Wu of Wei was pleased with himself after successfully resolving a matter, and his ministers were unable to match his wisdom. As he left the court, he had a joyful expression. Wu Qi approached him and asked, "Have you ever heard the story of King Zhuang of Chu?" Marquis Wu replied, "What's the story about?" Wu Qi responded, "King Zhuang of Chu once successfully resolved a matter, and his ministers were unable to match his wisdom. As he left the court, he had a worried expression. Shen Gong Wu Chen approached him and asked, 'Why do you look worried, Your Majesty?' King Zhuang replied, 'I'm worried because I was able to resolve the matter, but my ministers were unable to match my wisdom. According to the saying, "A ruler who finds a worthy teacher will become a king, one who finds a worthy friend will become a hegemon, one who finds a worthy advisor will survive, and one who relies solely on their own wisdom will perish." Now, with my limited abilities, if my ministers are unable to match my wisdom, our state is in danger of perishing! That's why I'm worried.' King Zhuang was worried, but you, my lord, are joyful." Marquis Wu was taken aback, bowed twice, and said, "Heaven has sent you to correct my mistakes."

**(2) Moral of the story:**

The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should not be complacent about their own abilities, but rather be concerned if their ministers are not able to match their wisdom. This is because a ruler who relies solely on their own wisdom is vulnerable to mistakes and ultimately, the downfall of their state. A good ruler should surround themselves with capable advisors and be humble enough to recognize their own limitations.

**(3) Counterpart in Western thought:**

The concept of a ruler recognizing their own limitations and seeking wise counsel has a counterpart in Western thought, particularly in the idea of the "prudent ruler" in Aristotelian philosophy. In Aristotle's "Politics," he argues that a prudent ruler should surround themselves with wise advisors and be willing to listen to their counsel. This idea is also reflected in the concept of "prudence" in Western political philosophy, which emphasizes the importance of careful deliberation and seeking advice from others in decision-making.

Additionally, the idea that a ruler who relies solely on their own wisdom is vulnerable to mistakes and downfall has a parallel in the concept of "hubris" in Greek tragedy. Hubris refers to the excessive pride and arrogance that can lead to a downfall, often due to a failure to recognize one's own limitations and seek wise counsel.

Overall, while the specific story and cultural context may differ, the underlying principles of humility, prudence, and seeking wise counsel are shared across Eastern and Western philosophical traditions. [end of text]
