Alright, I need to answer the question about the first historically recorded empress with a name and surname in Chinese history, and also explain what happened to the empresses before her. Let's start by recalling the early empresses in Chinese history. The Zhou Dynasty is often considered the beginning of recorded history in China, and during this time, empresses were already present. The first empress that comes to mind is Empress Gao, also known as Empress Dowager Gao, who was the wife of Emperor Gaozu of Han. However, she was more of a regent than a traditional empress. 

Moving forward, the first empress with a well-documented name and surname might be Empress Lü Zhi, also known as Empress Lü, who was the wife of Emperor Gaozu of Han. She was the first empress of the Han Dynasty and played a significant role in the early years of the dynasty. Before her, the empresses were either unnamed or their roles were less prominent in the historical records.

But wait, there might be earlier empresses in other dynasties. For instance, in the Zhou Dynasty, there were empresses like Empress Ji, who was the wife of King Wen of Zhou. However, their prominence might not be as well-documented as Empress Lü Zhi. So, considering the prominence and the availability of historical records, Empress Lü Zhi could be considered the first historically recorded empress with a name and surname.

As for the empresses before her, they might not have been as well-documented or their roles might not have been as significant in the historical narrative. This could be due to various reasons, such as the limited written records from that period or the patriarchal nature of society, which might have overshadowed the contributions of empresses.

Additionally, it's important to note that the role of empresses varied across different dynasties. In some periods, empresses had more influence and were more prominently featured in historical accounts, while in others, their roles were more subdued. This variation could also affect the prominence of empresses in historical records.

Moreover, considering the cultural and societal norms of ancient China, the status of empresses was closely tied to their relationships with emperors and their ability to influence court politics. Empress Lü Zhi, for example, was known for her political acumen and her role in shaping the early Han Dynasty.

In conclusion, while there might have been earlier empresses in Chinese history, Empress Lü Zhi is often recognized as the first historically recorded empress with a name and surname. The empresses before her might not have been as well-documented or their roles might not have been as significant in the historical narrative.
