This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

### (1) Translation of the Story into English

Wei Wu Hou (魏武侯) was discussing matters and made a decision that none of his ministers could match. After the court session, he had a pleased look on his face. Wu Qi (吳起) approached and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu (楚莊王) as recounted by those around him?" Wu Hou replied, "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?" Wu Qi responded, "King Zhuang of Chu was discussing matters and made a decision that none of his ministers could match. After the court session, he had a worried look on his face. Shen Gong Wu Chen (申公巫臣) approached and asked, 'Why do you look worried after the court session?' King Zhuang replied, 'I made a decision that none of my ministers could match, and that is why I am worried. As it was said by Zhong Gao (中蘬), "Those who can find a teacher among the feudal lords will become kings, those who can find a friend will become hegemonic, those who can find someone to question them will survive, and those who plot on their own and find no one better than themselves will perish." Now, with my lack of ability, none of my ministers can match me, and our state is close to ruin! That is why I am worried.' King Zhuang of Chu was worried, while you are pleased." Wu Hou hesitated and then bowed twice, saying, "It is as if the heavens have sent you to correct my mistake."

### (2) Explanation of the Moral of the Story

The moral of the story is that true wisdom and leadership involve recognizing one's own limitations and the value of having advisors who can challenge and improve upon one's decisions. King Zhuang of Chu's worry stems from the realization that if he is the only one making good decisions and no one else can match him, it suggests a lack of capable advisors and a potential for isolation and failure. On the other hand, Wei Wu Hou's initial pleasure at being the best decision-maker is seen as a sign of arrogance and a lack of self-awareness. The story emphasizes the importance of humility, the need for diverse perspectives, and the value of having a team that can provide critical feedback and support.

### (3) Counterparts in Western (European) Thought

The concepts in this story have several counterparts in Western (European) thought, particularly in the realms of philosophy, leadership, and ethics. Here are a few examples:

1. **Socratic Method**: The Socratic method, developed by the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates, emphasizes the importance of questioning and critical thinking. Socrates believed that true wisdom comes from recognizing one's own ignorance and the value of dialogue in uncovering deeper truths. This aligns with the idea that a leader should be open to being challenged and should seek out diverse perspectives.

2. **Aristotle's Virtue Ethics**: Aristotle's concept of the "Golden Mean" in his virtue ethics suggests that true virtue lies in finding a balance between excess and deficiency. In the context of leadership, this means avoiding the extremes of arrogance and excessive humility. A leader should be confident but also open to feedback and improvement.

3. **Servant Leadership**: The concept of servant leadership, popularized by Robert K. Greenleaf, emphasizes that leaders should serve their followers and prioritize their needs. This aligns with the idea that a leader should be humble and recognize the value of their team members.

4. **The Importance of Advisors**: In Western political thought, the role of advisors and the importance of having a diverse and capable team is often emphasized. For example, in Machiavelli's "The Prince," while the advice is more pragmatic and sometimes controversial, there is still a recognition of the need for a leader to have trusted advisors who can provide different perspectives.

5. **The Dunning-Kruger Effect**: In modern psychology, the Dunning-Kruger effect describes how people with low ability in a particular area often overestimate their ability, while those with high ability tend to underestimate it. This concept underscores the importance of self-awareness and the value of external feedback, which is a key theme in the story.

These Western concepts and ideas share a common thread with the story from the "Xunzi" in emphasizing the importance of humility, self-awareness, and the value of diverse perspectives in leadership and decision-making. [end of text]
