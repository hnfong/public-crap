**Q5: Was it moral? Views from various perspectives (10 points)**  
- **Utilitarian**: Moral—ended widespread harm, saved lives, boosted economy; net benefit huge.  
- **Deontological (rule-based)**: Questionable—deception and execution without due process violate moral rules (e.g., “do not kill”).  
- **Confucian**: Ambiguous—upholds *ren* (benevolence) by saving people, but violates *li* (ritual propriety) through deception and violence.  
- **Legalist**: Justified—strong, decisive action to enforce order and state interest; ends justify means.  
- **Modern human rights**: Unacceptable—violates rights to life, fair trial, and bodily autonomy.  
→ Moral evaluation depends on ethical framework and historical context.

**Q6: Explanation & fairness of the final comment (15 points)**  
**Meaning**:  
The quote contrasts three statesmen’s governance styles:  
- *Zichan* of Zheng: ruled by law and integrity → people *could not deceive* him (systemic integrity).  
- *Ziyan* (Zi Gong/Zi Chan’s successor) of Shandong’s Danfu: ruled by virtue and empathy → people *would not dare to deceive* him (moral authority).  
- *Ximen Bao* of Ye: ruled by authority and deterrence → people *dared not deceive* him (fear-based compliance).  
The final line asks: who was most virtuous/capable? A wise judge can discern.

**Fairness?**  
- **Partly fair**: Accurately captures *Ximen Bao*’s reputation for decisive, intimidating justice (as in the河伯 story).  
- **But reductive**: Reduces his complex governance (e.g., infrastructure, long-term planning) to “不敢欺” (deterrence), overlooking his constructive achievements.  
- **Historical bias**: The *Shiji* emphasizes moral hierarchy (Zi Chan > Zi Gong > Ximen Bao), reflecting Han Confucian values that prioritize virtue over efficacy.  
→ Fair as a *rhetorical summary*, but oversimplifies Ximen Bao’s legacy; his blend of pragmatism, wisdom, and reform was highly贤 (virtuous/capable) in practice.
