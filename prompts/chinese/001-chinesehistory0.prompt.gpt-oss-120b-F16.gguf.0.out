<|channel|>analysis<|message|>The user asks in Chinese: "中国历史记录第一个有名有姓的皇后是谁？她之前的皇后怎麽了？请简略作答。" They want a brief answer: Who is the first recorded empress with a known name and surname in Chinese history? And what happened to the empress before her? Provide concise answer.

We need to identify the first empress with a recorded name and surname. In Chinese history, the earliest empress (皇后) with a recorded name and surname is likely Empress Lü Zhi (吕雉), wife of Liu Bang (Han Gaozu). She is known as Empress Lü (or Empress Dowager Lü). She was the first empress of the Han dynasty, and the first empress with a recorded surname (Lü). However, there were earlier queens in the Qin dynasty? The Qin had no empress title; the king's wife was called queen (王后). The first recorded queen with a name? Possibly Queen Dowager Zhao (赵姬) of Qin? Actually, the first queen with a recorded name is probably "王后" of the Qin? Let's think.

The question: "中国历史记录第一个有名有姓的皇后是谁？她之前的皇后怎麽了？请简略作答。" Means: Who is the first empress in Chinese historical records with a known name and surname? What happened to the empress before her? Provide a brief answer.

We need to identify the first empress (皇后) with a recorded name and surname. The earliest dynasty with the title "皇后" is the Han dynasty (starting 202 BC). The first emperor (皇帝) was Liu Bang (Han Gaozu). His wife was Lü Zhi (吕雉). She is recorded as Empress (皇后). She had a surname Lü. So she is the first empress with a known name and surname.

Before her, there was the queen of Qin (王后) but not called "皇后". The title "皇后" started with Liu Bang. The previous queen (王后) of Qin was Lady Zhao (赵姬), mother of Qin Shi Huang, but she died earlier. However, the question asks "她之前的皇后怎麽了？" meaning "What happened to the empress before her?" So before Empress Lü, there was no empress because the title didn't exist. The previous queen (王后) of Qin was Lady Zhao, who died (or was forced to commit suicide?) Actually, Zhao Ji (赵姬) was the mother of Qin Shi Huang, but she was not an empress; she was a concubine? Let's recall: Qin Shi Huang's mother was Lady Zhao (赵姬), a concubine of King Zhuangxiang of Qin. She was later given the title "Queen Dowager" (太后) after her son became king. She died in 247 BC? Not sure.

But the question likely expects: The first empress with a recorded name and surname is Empress Lü Zhi (吕雉). Before her, there was no empress; the previous queen (王后) of the Qin dynasty, Lady Zhao (赵姬), was posthumously honored as queen mother, but she died earlier. Or perhaps they refer to Empress Dowager Lü's predecessor: Empress Dowager (皇后) of the Qin? Actually, the Qin dynasty had no emperor title, so no "皇后". So answer: Empress Lü Zhi, and before her there was no empress; the previous queen (王后) of Qin, Zhao Ji, died (or was executed) before the title existed.

Thus brief answer: Empress Lü Zhi (吕雉), wife of Liu Bang, is the first recorded empress with a surname. Before her, the title "皇后" didn't exist; the previous ruler's consort was the Qin queen Zhao Ji, who died (or was buried) and was not called empress.

Let's craft concise answer in Chinese, with bullet points.

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**第一位有名有姓的皇后**  
- **吕雉（吕后）**，姓吕，名雉，汉高祖刘邦的正妻。她在公元前202 年随刘邦称帝后被册封为“皇后”，也是史书上记载的第一位真正的皇后。

**她之前的皇后（或王后）怎样了？**  
- 在此之前的秦王（后来的秦始皇）只有“王后/后妃”之称，史书并未记载有正式的“皇后”。秦始皇的母亲 **赵姬**（赵氏）是王后（后妃），但她在秦王政即位前已去世，且从未拥有“皇后”这一称号。  
- 因此，**在吕雉之前并没有正式的皇后**，只有秦王的王后或后妃，且大多已逝或未被正式册封为皇后。 [end of text]
