<|channel|>analysis<|message|>The user asks: "中国历史记录第一个有名有姓的皇后是谁？她之前的皇后怎麽了？请简略作答。" They want a brief answer in Chinese. The question: "Who is the first recorded empress in Chinese history with a known name and surname? What happened to the empress before her?" So they ask: "中国历史记录第一个有名有姓的皇后是谁？她之前的皇后怎麽了？请简略作答。" So answer: The first recorded empress with a known name and surname is Empress Lü Zhi (吕雉), wife of Liu Bang (Emperor Gaozu of Han). Actually earlier there were queen consorts in earlier dynasties, but the first empress with a recorded name and surname is Empress Lü Zhi. The previous empress? The previous queen consort? The previous queen was Empress Dowager? Actually before the Han dynasty, the Qin dynasty had no empress; the first emperor Qin Shi Huang had no empress recorded. The previous queen consort was perhaps the queen of the Chu state? But the question likely refers to the first empress in Chinese history with a recorded name and surname: Empress Lü Zhi (Lü Zhi). The previous empress? There was no empress before her; the previous queen consort was the queen of the Chu state, but she was not an empress. Or perhaps the previous "皇后" was the wife of Emperor Yao? But those are legendary. So answer: The first recorded empress with a name and surname is Empress Lü Zhi (吕雉), wife of Liu Bang, founder of the Han dynasty. Before her, there was no official title of "皇后" in the Qin dynasty; Qin Shi Huang had no empress, only consorts. So answer accordingly.

Thus answer: Empress Lü Zhi (吕雉). Before her, there was no empress; the Qin dynasty had no empress, and the previous consort (e.g., Lady Zhao) died or was not recorded. So answer briefly.

Will answer in Chinese.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**第一位有明确姓名和姓氏的皇后**：  
- **吕雉（吕后）**，西汉开国皇帝刘邦（汉高祖）的正妻，史称“汉高祖皇后”。她的姓氏是**吕**，名字是**雉**，是中国史料中最早记载的、真正拥有“皇后”称号且留下完整姓名的女性。

**她之前的皇后情况**：  
- 在她之前的秦朝（公元前221‑207 年），秦始皇并未设立“皇后”这一正式称号，只有后宫妃嫔，史书中也没有留下正式的皇后姓名。  
- 因此，**在正式的“皇后”制度出现之前，并没有正式的皇后人物**，只有一些未被记载姓名的后妃或王后（如楚汉时期的楚王后等），但都不具备后世所称的“皇后”身份。  

简言之，**吕雉是中国历史上首位有名有姓的皇后**，在她之前的秦帝制并未设立皇后职务，故不存在前任皇后。 [end of text]
