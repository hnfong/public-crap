```
魏文侯时，西门豹为邺令。豹往到邺，会长老，问之民所疾苦。长老曰：「苦为河伯娶妇，以故贫。」豹问其故，对曰：「邺三老、廷掾常岁赋敛百姓，收取其钱得数百万，用其二三十万为河伯娶妇，与祝巫共分其余钱持归。当其时，巫行视小家女好者，云是当为河伯妇，即娉取。洗沐之，为治新缯绮縠衣，闲居斋戒；为治斋宫河上，张缇绛帷，女居其中。为具牛酒饭食，行十余日。共粉饰之，如嫁女床席，令女居其上，浮之河中。始浮，行数十里乃没。其人家有好女者，恐大巫祝为河伯取之，以故多持女远逃亡。以故城中益空无人，又困贫，所从来久远矣。民人俗语曰『即不为河伯娶妇，水来漂没，溺其人民』云。」西门豹曰：「至为河伯娶妇时，愿三老、巫祝、父老送女河上，幸来告语之，吾亦往送女。」皆曰：「诺。」

至其时，西门豹往会之河上。三老、官属、豪长者、里父老皆会，以人民往观之者三二千人。其巫，老女子也，已年七十。从弟子女十人所，皆衣缯单衣，立大巫后。西门豹曰：「呼河伯妇来，视其好丑。」即将女出帷中，来至前。豹视之，顾谓三老、巫祝、父老曰：「是女子不好，烦大巫妪为入报河伯，得更求好女，后日送之。」即使吏卒共抱大巫妪投之河中。有顷，曰：「巫妪何久也？弟子趣之！」复以弟子一人投河中。有顷，曰：「弟子何久也？复使一人趣之！」复投一弟子河中。凡投三弟子。西门豹曰：「巫妪弟子是女子也，不能白事，烦三老为入白之。」复投三老河中。西门豹簪笔磬折，向河立待良久。长老、吏傍观者皆惊恐。西门豹顾曰：「巫妪、三老不来还，柰之何？」欲复使廷掾与豪长者一人入趣之。皆叩头，叩头且破，额血流地，色如死灰。西门豹曰：「诺，且留待之须臾。」须臾，豹曰：「廷掾起矣。状河伯留客之久，若皆罢去归矣。」邺吏民大惊恐，从是以后，不敢复言为河伯娶妇。

西门豹即发民凿十二渠，引河水灌民田，田皆溉。当其时，民治渠少烦苦，不欲也。豹曰：「民可以乐成，不可与虑始。今父老子弟虽患苦我，然百岁后期令父老子孙思我言。」至今皆得水利，民人以给足富。十二渠经绝驰道，到汉之立，而长吏以为十二渠桥绝驰道，相比近，不可。欲合渠水，且至驰道合三渠为一桥。邺民人父老不肯听长吏，以为西门君所为也，贤君之法式不可更也。长吏终听置之。故西门豹为邺令，名闻天下，泽流后世，无绝已时，几可谓非贤大夫哉！

Keep your answers concise.
**Q1: Summary of the Story**

The story revolves around Ximen Bao, who was appointed as the magistrate of Ye during the reign of Duke Wen of Wei. Upon arriving in Ye, Ximen Bao discovered that the local officials and priests were exploiting the people by forcing them to offer young girls to the river god (Hebo) as a sacrifice, under the guise of preventing floods. Ximen Bao decided to put an end to this practice by tricking the officials and priests into believing that the river god was displeased with the offerings. He did so by throwing the chief priest and later the elders into the river, pretending to consult the river god, thereby putting an end to the practice of sacrificing young girls to the river god.

**Q2: Type of Women Usually Victimized**

The victims were usually young girls from poor families, as they were the easiest to exploit and least likely to have powerful allies to protect them.

**Q3: Beneficiaries of the Practice**

The beneficiaries were the local officials (such as the three elders and the officials) and the priests (including the chief priest and the witch), who profited from the money collected from the people for the supposed sacrifices.

**Q4: Wits or Force Used by the Protagonist**

The protagonist, Ximen Bao, used wits rather than force to deal with the situation. He tricked the officials and priests into believing that the river god was displeased with the offerings, thereby forcing them to stop the practice without resorting to direct confrontation or violence.

**Q5: Moral Perspective**

From a utilitarian perspective, Ximen Bao's actions were moral because they ended a harmful practice that victimized young girls and exploited the local population. From a deontological perspective, his actions might be seen as morally ambiguous, as he used deception and manipulation to achieve his goals. From a virtue ethics perspective, his actions could be seen as demonstrating courage and wisdom in addressing an unjust and harmful practice.

**Q6: Explanation of the Comment**

The comment compares three famous administrators: Zichan, Zi Qian, and Ximen Bao. It suggests that Zichan was so competent that people could not deceive him, Zi Qian was so compassionate that people could not bear to deceive him, and Ximen Bao was so authoritative that people dared not deceive him. The comment implies that all three were highly skilled in their respective ways of governance, but it does not explicitly rank their abilities. Whether the comment is fair depends on one's perspective on governance and leadership. It suggests that each leader excelled in a different aspect of governance, making direct comparison difficult.
