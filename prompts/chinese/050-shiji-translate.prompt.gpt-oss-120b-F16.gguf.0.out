<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to translate the Chinese text to English, preserving proper names in original Chinese characters, not transliterated. No explanations, just the translated text. Must be literal. Use original Chinese for names: e.g., 張釋之, 馮唐, 張廷尉, etc. Also places like 堂, etc. Keep Chinese characters for proper nouns. Also keep titles? Probably keep Chinese characters for titles like 中郎將, etc. The instruction: "For proper names (of people, emperors, places) please use the original Chinese to avoid inconsistency in transliteration. I repeat, You are not allowed to transliterate proper names." So we must keep Chinese characters for names. For other words, translate.

We need to produce a fairly long translation. Let's go through paragraph by paragraph.

《張釋之馮唐列傳》
張廷尉釋之者，堵陽人也，字季。有兄仲同居。以訾為騎郎，事孝文帝，十歲不得調，無所知名。釋之曰：「久宦減仲之產，不遂。」欲自免歸。中郎將袁盎知其賢，惜其去，乃請徙釋之補謁者。釋之既朝畢，因前言便宜事。文帝曰：「卑之，毋甚高論，令今可施行也。」於是釋之言秦漢之閒事，秦所以失而漢所以興者久之。文帝稱善，乃拜釋之為謁者仆射。
釋之從行，登虎圈。上問上林尉諸禽獸簿，十餘問，尉左右視，盡不能對。虎圈嗅夫從旁代尉對上所問禽獸簿甚悉，欲以觀其能口對響應無窮者。文帝曰：「吏不當若是邪？尉無賴！」乃詔釋之拜嗅夫為上林令。釋之久之前曰：「陛下以絳侯周勃何如人？」上曰：「長者也。」又復問：「東陽侯張相如何如人？」上復曰：「長者。」釋之曰：「夫絳侯、東陽侯稱為長者，此兩人言事曾不能出口，豈斅此嗅夫諜諜利口捷給哉！且秦以任刀筆之吏，吏爭以亟疾苛察相高，然其敝徒文具耳，無怙隱之實。以故不聞其過，陵遲而至於二世，天下土崩。今陛下以嗅夫口辯而超遷之，臣恐天下隨風靡靡，爭為口辩而無其實。且下之化上疾於景響，舉錯不可不審也。」文帝曰：「善。」乃止不拜嗅夫。
上就車，召釋之參乘，徐行，問釋之秦之敝。具以質言。至宮，上拜釋之為公車令。
頃之，太子與梁王共車入朝，不下司馬門，於是釋之追止太子、梁王無得入殿門。遂劾不下公門不敬，奏之。薄太后聞之，文帝免冠謝曰：「教兒子不謹。」薄太后乃使使承諾赦太子、梁王，然後得入。文帝由是奇釋之，拜為中大夫。
頃之，至中郎將。從行至霸陵，居北臨廁。是時慎夫人從，上指示慎夫人新豐道，曰：「此走邯鄲道也。」使慎夫人鼓瑟，上自倚瑟而歌，意慘悽悲懷，顧謂群臣曰：「嗟乎！以北山石為槨，用紵絮斮陳，蕠漆其間，豈可動哉！」左右皆曰：「善。」釋之前進曰：「使其中有可欲者，雖錮南山猶有郄；使

Wait the text is long. We'll need to translate all.

Given the length, we must produce a full translation. Let's proceed stepwise.

I'll produce translation preserving Chinese proper names.

Paragraph 1:

《張釋之馮唐列傳》
張廷尉釋之者，堵陽人也，字季。有兄仲同居。以訾為騎郎，事孝文帝，十歲不得調，無所知名。釋之曰：「久宦減仲之產，不遂。」欲自免歸。中郎將袁盎知其賢，惜其去，乃請徙釋之補謁者。釋之既朝畢，因前言便宜事。文帝曰：「卑之，毋甚高論，令今可施行也。」於是釋之言秦漢之閒事，秦所以失而漢所以興者久之。文帝稱善，乃拜釋之為謁者仆射。

Translation:

"The Biography of 張釋之 and 馮唐"
張廷尉釋之 was a native of 堵陽, styled 季. He lived together with his elder brother 仲. He entered service as a cavalry officer under the name 訾, serving 孝文帝; after ten years he could not be promoted and was unknown. 釋之 said, “Long years of service have reduced my brother’s estate, and it has not succeeded.” He wished to be exempted and return home. The 中郎將 袁盎, knowing his talent and regretting his departure, petitioned to have 釋之 transferred to a position of attendant. After 釋之 completed his morning audience, he took the opportunity to speak conveniently. 文帝 said, “Humiliate him, do not speak too highly; let it be applicable now.” Then 釋之 spoke about the period between Qin and Han, how Qin’s loss and Han’s rise had been long. 文帝 praised him as good and appointed 釋之 as 謁者仆射.

But need to be more literal. Keep Chinese titles.

Let's rewrite more literal:

"The Biography of 張釋之 and 馮唐"
張廷尉釋之 was a man of 堵陽, styled 季. He had an elder brother 仲 with whom he lived. He entered service as a cavalry officer under the name 訾, serving 孝文帝; after ten years he could not be transferred, and was unknown. 釋之 said, “Long service has reduced my brother’s property, and it has not succeeded.” He wanted to be exempted and return. The 中郎將 袁盎, knowing his virtue and regretting his departure, therefore requested that 釋之 be transferred to a position of attendant. After 釋之 finished his morning audience, he took the opportunity to speak conveniently. 文帝 said, “Lower him, do not speak too highly; make it applicable now.” Then 釋之 spoke of the interval between Qin and Han, how Qin’s loss and Han’s rise had been long. 文帝 praised him as good, and appointed 釋之 as 謁者仆射.

Ok.

Next paragraph:

釋之從行，登虎圈。上問上林尉諸禽獸簿，十餘問，尉左右視，盡不能對。虎圈嗅夫從旁代尉對上所問禽獸簿甚悉，欲以觀其能口對響應無窮者。文帝曰：「吏不當若是邪？尉無賴！」乃詔釋之拜嗅夫為上林令。釋之久之前曰：「陛下以絳侯周勃何如人？」上曰：「長者也。」又復問：「東陽侯張相如何如人？」上復曰：「長者。」釋之曰：「夫絳侯、東陽侯稱為長者，此兩人言事曾不能出口，豈斅此嗅夫諜諜利口捷給哉！且秦以任刀筆之吏，吏爭以亟疾苛察相高，然其敝徒文具耳，無怙隱之實。以故不聞其過，陵遲而至於二世，天下土崩。今陛下以嗅夫口辯而超遷之，臣恐天下隨風靡靡，爭為口辯而無其實。且下之化上疾於景響，舉錯不可不審也。」文帝曰：「善。」乃止不拜嗅夫。

Translation:

釋之 was traveling, and ascended the Tiger Enclosure. The emperor asked the 上林尉 about the register of birds and beasts, more than ten questions; the尉 and his attendants looked, but could not answer. The Tiger Enclosure's keeper (嗅夫) from beside substituted for the尉 and answered the emperor's questions about the register in great detail, wishing to test his ability to respond endlessly. 文帝 said, “Is it proper for an official to be like this? The尉 is unprincipled!” He then issued an edict appointing 釋之 to make the keeper the 上林令. Earlier, 釋之 said, “Your Majesty, how is 絳侯 周勃 as a person?” The emperor replied, “He is an elder.” He again asked, “How is 東陽侯 張相 as a person?” The emperor again replied, “He is an elder.” 釋之 said, “The titles 絳侯 and 東陽侯 are called elders; these two men cannot even speak of affairs, how can they be like this keeper who is quick‑tongued and sharp? Moreover, Qin employed officials who handled the pen and sword; officials competed to be swift and harsh in examination, yet their worn-out documents were only paperwork, lacking genuine compassion. Therefore their faults were not heard, and they delayed until the second generation, when the world collapsed. Now Your Majesty promotes the keeper for his eloquence, and I fear the world will follow the wind, striving for eloquence without substance. Moreover, the lower's influence on the upper spreads rapidly, and mistakes must be examined carefully.” 文帝 said, “Good.” He then stopped and did not appoint the keeper.

But need to keep Chinese terms: "虎圈" maybe "Tiger Enclosure". "嗅夫" maybe "the keeper". Keep Chinese.

Let's produce literal translation.

Proceed.

Next paragraph:

上就車，召釋之參乘，徐行，問釋之秦之敝。具以質言。至宮，上拜釋之為公車令。

Translation:

The emperor got on his carriage, summoned 釋之 to accompany him, and proceeded slowly. He asked 釋之 about the decline of Qin. 釋之 answered in detail. Upon reaching the palace, the emperor appointed 釋之 as 公車令.

Next:

頃之，太子與梁王共車入朝，不下司馬門，於是釋之追止太子、梁王無得入殿門。遂劾不下公門不敬，奏之。薄太后聞之，文帝免冠謝曰：「教兒子不謹。」薄太后乃使使承諾赦太子、梁王，然後得入。文帝由是奇釋之，拜為中大夫。

Translation:

Soon after, the Crown Prince and the Prince of 梁 shared a carriage to enter the court, and did not pass through the 司馬門. Then 釋之 pursued and stopped the Crown Prince and the Prince of 梁, preventing them from entering the palace gate. He therefore charged them with disrespect for not passing through the public gate, and submitted a memorial. The Empress Dowager (薄太后) heard of it, and 文帝 removed his cap and apologized, saying, “I taught my son to be careless.” The Empress Dowager then sent an emissary to grant pardon to the Crown Prince and the Prince of 梁, after which they were allowed to enter. 文帝, because of this, favored 釋之 and appointed him as 中大夫.

Next:

頃之，至中郎將。從行至霸陵，居北臨廁。是時慎夫人從，上指示慎夫人新豐道，曰：「此走邯鄲道也。」使慎夫人鼓瑟，上自倚瑟而歌，意慘悽悲懷，顧謂群臣曰：「嗟乎！以北山石為槨，用紵絮斮陳，蕠漆其間，豈可動哉！」左右皆曰：「善。」釋之前進曰：「使其中有可欲者，雖錮南山猶有郄；使其中無可欲者，雖無石槨，又何戚焉！」文帝稱善。其後拜釋之為廷尉。

Translation:

Soon after, he arrived at the position of 中郎將. While traveling to 霸陵, he stayed north of the latrine (臨廁). At that time, 慎夫人 accompanied, and the emperor pointed out to 慎夫人 the 新豐道, saying, “This is the road that runs to 邯鄲.” He ordered 慎夫人 to play the zither, and the emperor leaned on the zither and sang, his mood mournful and sorrowful, and said to the officials, “Alas! To use the stone of the northern mountain as a coffin, to use cotton fluff to line it, to lacquer it in between, how can it be moved?” The attendants all said, “Good.” 釋之, advancing forward, said, “If there is something desirable within, even if it is locked in the southern mountain there is still a gap; if there is nothing desirable within, even without a stone coffin, why be distressed?” 文帝 praised him as good. Later he appointed 釋之 as 廷尉.

But need to keep Chinese terms: "廷尉". Good.

頃之，上行出中渭橋，有一人從橋下走出，乘輿馬驚。於是使騎捕，屬之廷尉。釋之治問。曰：「縣人來，聞蹕，匿橋下。久之，以為行已過，即出，見乘輿車騎，即走耳。」廷尉秦當，一人犯蹕，當罰金。文帝怒曰：「此人親驚吾馬，吾馬賴柔和，令他馬，固不敗傷我乎？而廷尉乃當之罰金！」釋之曰：「法者天子所與天下公共也。今法如此，且更重之，是法不信於民也。且方其時， 上使立

Translation:

Soon after, the emperor traveled out of the Zhongwei Bridge, and a man emerged from under the bridge, startling the emperor's carriage horse. The emperor then ordered mounted men to capture him, and the case was assigned to the 廷尉. 釋之 investigated and asked, “A county man came, heard the imperial procession, hid under the bridge. After a while, thinking the procession had passed, he emerged, saw the carriage and horses, and fled.” The 廷尉, Qin, judged that a person had violated the imperial procession and should be fined. 文帝 was angry and said, “This man personally startled my horse; my horse relies on gentleness; if I order another horse, would it not cause injury to me? Yet the 廷尉 imposes a fine!” 釋之 said, “The law is what the Son of Heaven gives to the world in common. Now the law is like this, and you make it heavier; the law loses credibility among the people. Moreover, at that time, if the emperor ordered execution, that would be enough. Now you have placed the 廷尉, the 廷尉, as the peace of the world; a tilt and the world’s use of law becomes heavy or light; where can the people place their hands and feet? Only Your Majesty should examine this.” After a long time, the emperor said, “The 廷尉 is correct.”

Next:

其後有人盜高廟坐前玉環，捕得，文帝怒，下廷尉治。釋之案律盜宗廟服御物者為奏，奏當棄市。上大怒曰：「人之無道，乃盜先帝廟器，吾屬廷尉者，欲致之族，而君以法奏之，非吾所以共承宗廟意也。」釋之免冠頓首謝曰：「法如是足也。且罪等，然以逆順為差。今盜宗廟器而族之，有如萬分之一，假令愚民取長陵一抔土，陛下何以加其法乎？」久之，文帝與太后言之，乃許廷尉當。是時，中尉條侯周亞夫與梁相山都侯王恬開見釋之持議平，乃結為親友。張廷尉由此天下稱之。

Later, someone stole the jade ring that was placed in front of the high temple, and was captured; 文帝 was angry and ordered the 廷尉 to handle the case. 釋之 examined the law concerning theft of sacred temple clothing and implements, and the case was to be dismissed to the market. The emperor was greatly angry and said, “A man without the Way steals the former emperor’s temple vessels; my officials, the 廷尉, wish to punish his clan, but the sovereign, by law, submits it; this is not in line with the intention of the ancestral temple.” 釋之, removing his cap and kneeling, apologized, “If the law is as such, it suffices. Moreover, crimes are equal,
