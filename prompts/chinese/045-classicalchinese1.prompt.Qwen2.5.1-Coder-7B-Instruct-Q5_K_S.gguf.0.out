Q1: The story is about West门豹在魏文侯时期担任邺令，他揭露了当地官员和巫祝以河伯娶妇为名向百姓勒索钱财的腐败行为，并通过智斗和果断行动，最终废除了这一恶习，改善了百姓的生活。他还带领百姓开渠引水，解决了农田灌溉问题，使邺地得以繁荣。

Q2: The victims in the story were young girls, specifically those deemed attractive by the witch and chosen to be offered to the river god as a sacrifice.

Q3: The old practice benefited the officials and witch who collected the money and used it for their own purposes, while the victims were the young girls who were forced to sacrifice their lives.

Q4: The protagonist used wits to deal with the situation. Instead of directly confronting the officials and witch, he pretended to agree with their practices and then exposed their corruption through a clever plan.

Q5: Whether it was moral for the protagonist to do so is a matter of perspective. From a utilitarian standpoint, his actions saved many lives and improved the quality of life for the people of邺. However, from a moral standpoint, his methods could be seen as harsh and potentially cruel. Some might argue that his actions were justified to prevent greater harm, while others might condemn his use of deceit and violence.

Q6: The comment suggests that the three individuals—Zi Cǎn of Zheng, Zi Ji of Shangu, and West门豹 of Yu—were the most capable rulers. The comment is fair in the sense that it acknowledges their achievements in maintaining law and order and improving the well-being of their people. However, it may be subjective to determine who is the most "virtuous" or "capable" ruler, as different perspectives and criteria can lead to different conclusions. [end of text]
