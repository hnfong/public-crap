# 欢聚少，离别多

你同意吗？我更愿意说：欢聚不易，离别常在。  
人生像一条河，支流众多，汇合短暂，分流却漫长。小学毕业、初中转学、父母出差、朋友远行，每一次“再见”都像把日历翻过几页。  
欢聚需要时间、地点与心情的同频：节假日、毕业季、婚礼或葬礼，才把分散的人拉回同一张桌。  
而离别却常在日常里发生：搬一次家、换一份工作、一次考试结束，甚至一次争吵后的沉默，都是“分”的开始。  
科技让距离变短，却让“在一起”的质感变薄。视频里我们笑着挥手，屏幕一黑，热闹就散。  
但离别并非只有悲伤，它也逼我们学会珍惜与独立。  
所以我同意这句话：欢聚少，离别多。  
但我更愿意把“少”变成“精”，把“多”变成“成长”。当欢聚到来时，我们认真拥抱；当离别来临时，我们好好告别。  
人生因此更真实，也更有温度。 [end of text]
