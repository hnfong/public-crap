**Translation:**

The Duke of Wei was planning something, but none of his officials could grasp the details. When he returned home, he looked pleased. Wu Qi said, "Have you ever heard a saying from the King of Chu?" The Duke of Wei replied, "What did the King of Chu say?" Wu Qi said, "The King of Chu said that when he was planning something, none of his officials could grasp the details, and when he returned home, he looked worried. Shensheng, the Minister of Rites, asked him, 'Your Majesty, why do you look worried when you return home?' The King replied, 'It's because I plan things and none of my officials can keep up with me. The wise man said, "When a lord is able to lead his state to victory, he is a king; when he is able to befriend his neighbors, he is a hegemon; when he is able to sow doubt in the minds of his enemies, he is able to preserve his state. But when a lord is able to plan things and none of his officials can keep up with him, he is doomed to perish." Now, I am not a wise leader, and none of my officials can keep up with me, so my state is on the brink of destruction. That's why I'm worried.' The King of Chu worries, while you, sir, look pleased."

The Duke of Wei bowed twice and said, "The heavens have sent you to correct my mistakes."

**Moral of the story:**

The moral of the story is that a leader who is too clever or too powerful can be a danger to himself and his state. If a leader's plans are too complex or too far-reaching, his officials may not be able to understand or keep up with them, leading to confusion, chaos, and ultimately, the downfall of the state. The story highlights the importance of humility and the need for a leader to be mindful of the limitations of his officials and the potential consequences of his actions.

**Counterpart in Western thought:**

The concept in this story has a counterpart in Western thought, particularly in the ideas of Aristotle and Niccolò Machiavelli. Aristotle's concept of "phronesis" (φρόνησις) or practical wisdom emphasizes the importance of a leader's ability to balance their own knowledge and abilities with the limitations of their officials and the circumstances of their state. Machiavelli's concept of " virtù" (virtue) also emphasizes the importance of a leader's ability to adapt to changing circumstances and to balance their own power and ambition with the needs and limitations of their state.

In Western thought, this concept is often associated with the idea of the "hubris" or excessive pride and ambition that can lead to a leader's downfall. The story of the King of Chu and the Duke of Wei can be seen as a cautionary tale about the dangers of hubris and the importance of humility and self-awareness in leadership. [end of text]
