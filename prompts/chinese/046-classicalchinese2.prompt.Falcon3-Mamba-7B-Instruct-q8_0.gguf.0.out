(1) Translation:

The Marquis of Wei was plotting something, and the ministers were all at a loss. When the court was about to disperse, he had a happy expression. Wu Qi approached and said, "There was once a King Chu who heard such words from his ministers: 'The king consults with his ministers, and they respond; the king befriends people, and they become his friends; the king suspects, and they are in danger; he secretly plots, and he is at a loss. The king of Chu said, 'The king consults with his ministers, and they respond; the king befriends people, and they become his friends; the king suspects, and they are in danger; he secretly plots, and he is at a loss. Now, I am at a loss, and the ministers are at a loss, and that is why I am happy. But I am not at a loss because I am not clever, and the ministers are not clever, and that is why I am at a loss. Is this not because I am plotting secretly, and none of my ministers can match me? That is why I am at a loss.' Wu Qi said, 'The king of Chu spoke of being at a loss, and you are happy. This is why I am smiling.'"

(3) Western (European) Counterparts:

The concepts in this story have counterparts in Western thought, particularly in the realms of political philosophy and leadership. The idea of a ruler being at a loss due to secretive plotting and not being open with their ministers is reminiscent of the classical Greek concept of "hubris," which refers to excessive pride or ambition that leads to one's downfall. In Western political thought, the importance of transparency, trust, and open communication between leaders and their advisors is often emphasized. Additionally, the story highlights the value of having wise and trustworthy advisors, a concept that resonates with the classical Greek notion of "phronesis," or practical wisdom, which is crucial for effective leadership. The story also touches on the idea of leadership being vulnerable to internal strife and betrayal, a theme that is present in various forms in Western literature and history. [end of text]
