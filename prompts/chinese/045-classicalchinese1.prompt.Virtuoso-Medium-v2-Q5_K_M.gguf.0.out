Q1: The story is about West Gate Bao, a magistrate of Ye during the reign of King Wen of Wei. He discovered that the local officials and priests were exploiting the people by claiming that the river god needed a bride, which led to the sacrifice of young girls and the impoverishment of the town. Bao cleverly exposed the fraud by threatening to drown the priestess and her followers, which frightened the officials and priests into abandoning the practice. He then initiated a project to build twelve canals to irrigate the fields, which brought prosperity to the people.

Q2: Young and beautiful women were usually the victims in the story.

Q3: The local officials (three elders and clerks) and priests (shamans and witches) were deemed to benefit from the old practice of offering girls.

Q4: The protagonist used wits to deal with the situation. He cleverly exposed the fraud by threatening to drown the priestess and her followers, which frightened the officials and priests into abandoning the practice. He did not use force directly but used the fear of drowning to achieve his goal.

Q5: From a moral perspective, the protagonist's actions can be viewed as both justified and questionable. On one hand, he was protecting the innocent girls from being sacrificed and stopping the exploitation of the people by the officials and priests. On the other hand, his actions involved threatening to drown people, which could be seen as cruel and unjust. However, given the circumstances and the fact that he was trying to stop a harmful practice, his actions can be seen as morally justified.

Q6: The quote means that Zichan governed Zheng, and the people could not deceive him; Zijian governed Danfu, and the people would not deceive him; and Ximen Bao governed Ye, and the people dared not deceive him. The question asks which of the three officials was the most capable. The comment is fair because it highlights the effectiveness of each official in governing their respective regions. However, it does not provide a definitive answer to which one was the most capable, leaving it up to the reader to make a judgment based on their understanding of the officials' actions and achievements.
