<think>Hmm, this is a classical Chinese passage from Xunzi with three clear requests. The user wants an English translation, an explanation of the moral, and a comparison to Western thought. 

For the translation, I need to maintain the proper names in Chinese while making the English flow naturally. The story has dialogue and philosophical quotes, so I should preserve the tone while ensuring readability. The moral should focus on the contrast between the two rulers' reactions to similar situations, highlighting the danger of self-satisfaction. 

For the Western counterpart, I immediately think of Socrates' "know thyself" and the hubris-nemesis theme in Greek tragedy. The idea of a ruler needing advisors to avoid downfall also echoes in Roman history and Machiavelli's writings. I can structure this by pairing each Chinese concept with its Western parallel, making the comparison explicit. 

The response should be organized in three parts as requested, with the moral and Western thought sections being analytical but concise. I'll avoid over-explaining and stick to the most relevant parallels.</think>(1) **Translation into English:**

Marquis Wu of Wei was discussing affairs of state with his ministers, and his plans were so well-formulated that none of the other ministers could match them. After the court session ended, he wore a look of joy. Wu Qi进言 and said: "Has anyone ever told Your Majesty the words of King Zhuang of Chu?" The Marquis asked: "What were the words of King Zhuang of Chu?" Wu Qi replied: "King Zhuang of Chu谋划 state affairs, and his plans were so well-formulated that none of the other ministers could match them. After the court session ended, he wore a look of worry. Shen Gong巫臣进前 and asked: 'Your Majesty, why do you wear a look of worry after the court session?' King Zhuang said: 'I discuss state affairs, and my plans are so well-formulated that none of the other ministers can match them. That is why I am worried. This is in accordance with the words of the sage YiGuan: "The feudal lords who seek out a teacher for themselves will become kings; those who seek out friends for themselves will become hegemons; those who seek out疑者 (someone to question them) will survive; those who谋划 for themselves and think no one is their equal will perish." Now, with my unvirtuous nature, and yet none of my ministers can match me, my state is almost on the brink of ruin!' That is why he was worried. King Zhuang of Chu was worried, while Your Majesty is joyful." Marquis Wu of Wei stepped back and bowed twice, saying: "Heaven heaven has sent you to correct the errors of my failing rule."

(2) **Explanation of the Moral:**

The moral of the story is a warning against **self-satisfaction and arrogance**. When a ruler thinks he is superior to all his ministers and that no one can challenge his谋划, he is in great danger. The story contrasts two rulers in the same situation: King Zhuang of Chu, who was忧色 (worried) because he realized that having no one to challenge his ideas meant his country was almost亡 (lost), and Marquis Wu of Wei, who was喜色 (joyful) because he thought his own brilliance was unmatched. Wu Qi uses this contrast to teach the Marquis that a true king should be worried when he finds no one who can surpass him, because it means he lacks a 老师 (teacher) and 友 (friend) who can provide criticism and better ideas. The key message is that a ruler's strength lies in having capable advisors who can question and improve his plans, not in being the smartest person in the room. The ideal ruler is one who seeks out and listens to wise counsel, recognizing his own limitations.

(3) **Counterpart in Western Thought:**

Yes, the concepts in this story have several strong counterparts in Western European thought:

*   **Socrates' "Know Thyself" and the Dangers of Hubris:** The core warning against arrogance and self-satisfaction is central to Greek philosophy. Socrates' famous dictum "Know thyself" emphasizes self-awareness and recognizing one's own ignorance. The Marquis's pride is a form of **hubris** (ὕβρις), the excessive pride that leads to a downfall in Greek tragedy. King Zhuang's worry reflects the Socratic wisdom of knowing that you do *not* know everything.

*   **The Need for Critical Advisors (The "Devil's Advocate"):** The idea that a ruler needs people who can challenge his ideas is a key theme in Western political philosophy. The Roman Catholic Church's practice of appointing a **"Devil's Advocate"** (Advocatus Diaboli) to argue against the canonization of a saint is a direct institutionalization of this principle. In modern governance, the concept of a **"loyal opposition"** or a cabinet of **"critical thinkers"** who are not afraid to voice dissent is seen as essential for good decision-making.

*   **The Theme of "Pride Comes Before a Fall":** This is a classic **Biblical proverb** (Proverbs 16:18) that perfectly encapsulates the story's moral. The worry of King Zhuang is the antithesis of pride, and it is what allows his state to survive. Marquis Wu's joy is the pride that precedes a potential downfall.

*   **Machiavelli's Advice on Counsel:** In *The Prince*, Machiavelli advises a prince to **seek wise counsel**. He distinguishes between a prince who thinks he knows everything and one who is open to advice. The former is likely to be ruined, while the latter can maintain his state. This parallels the warning in the Xunzi passage.

*   **The Theme of "Hubris and Nemesis" in Greek Tragedy:** The tragic downfall of great heroes due to their excessive pride (**hubris**) is a recurring theme in the works of Sophocles and Aeschylus. The worry of King Zhuang is a preventative measure against this tragic fate.

In summary, while the specific story and its characters are Chinese, the philosophical warning about the dangers of a leader's arrogance and the necessity of critical counsel is a universal theme that resonates strongly throughout Western European philosophy, political theory, and literature.
