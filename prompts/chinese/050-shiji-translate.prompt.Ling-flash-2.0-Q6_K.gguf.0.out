《Zhang Shizhi and Feng Teng Biographies》

Zhang Shizhi, from Duyang, courtesy name Ji. He had an elder brother named Zhang Zhong living with him. By virtue of his family's wealth, he became a cavalry officer, serving Emperor Wen of Han. After ten years without promotion and remaining obscure, Zhang Shizhi said: "A long tenure as an official reduces my brother's property and does not bring success." He intended to resign and return home. The general-in-chief Yuan Ang, recognizing his talent, regretted his departure and requested to transfer Zhang Shizhi to fill the position of attendant. After attending court, Zhang Shizhi took the opportunity to speak about matters beneficial to the present. Emperor Wen said: "Speak humbly, do not make lofty statements that cannot be implemented now." Thus, Zhang Shizhi spoke at length about the affairs between Qin and Han, why Qin lost and Han prospered. Emperor Wen praised him and appointed him as attendant and deputy head of the imperial guards.

Zhang Shizhi followed the emperor's carriage, climbed the tiger enclosure. The emperor inquired about the register of birds and beasts in the upper forest, asking over ten questions. The upper forest commander looked left and right, unable to answer. The tiger enclosure keeper beside him answered the questions about the register of birds and beasts very thoroughly, wanting to demonstrate his ability to respond orally without end. Emperor Wen said: "Officials should not be like this! The commander is unreliable!" He then ordered Zhang Shizhi to appoint the tiger enclosure keeper as the commander of the upper forest. Zhang Shizhi stepped forward long before and said: "How is the Marquis of Zhou Bo,绛侯周勃? And how is the Marquis of Dongyang, 東陽侯張相如?" Emperor Wen replied: "They are both elders." Zhang Shizhi said: "The Marquis of Zhou Bo and the Marquis of Dongyang are called elders, yet these two could not utter a word when discussing matters. How can they be models for this talkative and clever tiger enclosure keeper? Moreover, Qin relied on scribes, and officials competed to be swift and strict, but their shortcomings were merely formalities, without genuine compassion. Therefore, their faults went unnoticed, leading to decline and collapse by the time of the Second Emperor. Now, if you promote this talkative tiger enclosure keeper based solely on his eloquence, I fear that the people will follow the wind and become empty talkers without substance. Moreover, the influence of the lower on the upper is swifter than shadow and echo; actions and decisions cannot be taken lightly." Emperor Wen said: "Good," and stopped the appointment of the tiger enclosure keeper.

After ascending the carriage, the emperor summoned Zhang Shizhi to ride alongside, slowly, and asked him about the weaknesses of Qin. Zhang Shizhi answered truthfully. Upon arriving at the palace, the emperor appointed him as head of the imperial carriage service.

Not long after, the crown prince and Liang Wang rode in the same carriage to court and did not dismount at the gate. Zhang Shizhi chased after them and stopped the crown prince and Liang Wang from entering the palace gate. He then accused them of disrespecting the gate and reported the incident. Empress Dowager Bo heard of it, and Emperor Wen removed his hat and apologized: "I was remiss in teaching my son." Empress Dowager Bo then sent a messenger to issue an imperial pardon for the crown prince and Liang Wang, after which they were allowed to enter. Emperor Wen was impressed by Zhang Shizhi and appointed him as a middle counselor.

Not long after, he became a general. Following the emperor to Baling, he sat north of the toilet. At that time, Consort Shen was accompanying the emperor, and he pointed out the new road to Consort Shen in Xinfeng, saying: "This is the road to Handan." He asked Consort Shen to play the zither, and the emperor leaned against the zither, singing, his expression one of deep sorrow. He turned to the ministers and said: "Alas! If we use north mountain stone as a coffin and layer it with cattail fiber and lacquer, could it be moved?" All around said: "Good." Zhang Shizhi stepped forward and said: "If there is something desirable inside, even if it is sealed with the Southern Mountain, there will be gaps; if there is nothing desirable inside, even without stone coffins, what is there to worry about?" Emperor Wen praised him. Later, he appointed Zhang Shizhi as the chief justice.

Not long after, the emperor went out and passed the Zhongwei Bridge. Someone suddenly emerged from under the bridge, startling the carriage horse. The emperor ordered the riders to arrest him and handed him over to the chief justice. Zhang Shizhi interrogated him. The man said: "I came from the countryside, heard the imperial carriage approaching, hid under the bridge, waited a long time, thinking it had passed, then came out, saw the carriage and horses, and ran away." The chief justice, according to the law, sentenced him to a fine. Emperor Wen was angry and said: "This person startled my horse directly. Fortunately, my horse is gentle; if it had been another horse, wouldn't it have injured me? Yet the chief justice only sentences him to a fine!" Zhang Shizhi said: "The law is what the emperor and the world share. Now the law is this, but you want to increase the penalty, so the law will no longer be trusted by the people. Moreover, at that moment, if the emperor ordered immediate execution, it would be done. Now that the case has been handed to the chief justice, the chief justice is the balance of the world. If there is any deviation, the laws throughout the world will be arbitrary, and where will the people place their hands and feet? I hope the emperor will consider this." After a long time, Emperor Wen said: "The chief justice should be correct."

Later, someone stole the jade ring in front of the High Temple. The culprit was arrested, and Emperor Wen was furious, ordering the chief justice to handle the case. Zhang Shizhi cited the law: stealing items from the imperial temple is punishable by death. Emperor Wen was furious and said: "This person is lawless and stole the temple vessels of the former emperor. I entrust you, the chief justice, to punish him, but you cite the law. This is not my intention to honor the imperial temple." Zhang Shizhi removed his hat and knelt, apologizing: "The law is like this, it is sufficient. Moreover, the crime is the same, but the degree of rebellion and obedience should be considered. Now, stealing temple vessels and executing entire families, even if it happens to one in ten thousand, if a foolish person takes a handful of soil from Changling, how will you punish him according to the law?" Emperor Wen and the empress dowager discussed it, and finally agreed to the chief justice's sentence. At this time, the generalissimo Zhaos侯周亚夫 and Liang's marquis, Shan都侯王恬开, seeing Zhang Shizhi uphold fair judgment, became his friends. Zhang Shizhi was thus praised throughout the empire.

Later, Emperor Wen died, and Emperor Jing ascended the throne. Zhang Shizhi was afraid, feigned illness, and wanted to resign, fearing a great punishment; he wanted to apologize but did not know how. He followed Wang Sheng's advice and finally apologized. Emperor Jing did not hold it against him.

Wang Sheng was good at speaking about the Huang-Lao philosophy and was a recluse. He was once summoned to stand in the courtyard, where the three dukes and nine ministers gathered. Wang Sheng, an old man, said: "I am untying my shoes," and turned to Zhang Shizhi: "Tie my shoes for me!" Zhang Shizhi knelt and tied them. Afterward, someone said to Wang Sheng: "Why embarrass Zhang Shizhi in court and make him tie your shoes?" Wang Sheng said: "I am old and humble, and I know I will not benefit Zhang Shizhi. Zhang Shizhi is now a famous minister under heaven, so I deliberately embarrassed him by making him tie my shoes, to give him more weight." The ministers, hearing this, respected Wang Sheng and Zhang Shizhi even more.

Zhang Shizhi served Emperor Jing for more than a year as the prime minister of Huainan Wang, still subject to previous faults. After a long time, Zhang Shizhi died. His son, Zhang Zhi, courtesy name Zhang Changong, became a doctor, was dismissed, and because he could not adapt to the times, he never held office.

Feng Teng's grandfather was from Zhao, his father moved to Dai, and after the Han founding, moved to Anling. Feng Teng was famous for his filial piety, served as a chief of the middle rank, and served Emperor Wen. Emperor Wen's carriage passed by, asked Feng Teng: "Old man, how did you become an attendant? Where is your home?" Feng Teng answered truthfully. Emperor Wen said: "When I lived in Dai, my food supervisor Gao Que often spoke to me about the bravery of Zhao general Li Qi at the Battle of Julu. Now, every time I eat, my thoughts are still on Julu. Do you know about it?" Feng Teng replied: "Still not as good as Generals Lian Po and Li Mu." The emperor said: "Why?" Feng Teng said: "My grandfather in Zhao was a general, good at Li Mu. My father was prime minister of Dai, good at Zhao general Li Qi, and knew his character." After hearing about Lian Po and Li Mu, the emperor was pleased, slapped his thigh and said: "Alas! If only I could have Lian Po and Li Mu as my generals, would I worry about the Xiongnu?" Feng Teng said: "Your servant dares to say that even if you have Lian Po and Li Mu, you cannot use them." The emperor was angry, rose, and entered the palace. After a long time, he summoned Feng Teng to reprimand him: "Why embarrass me in public and have no private place?" Feng Teng apologized: "A humble person does not know taboos."

At that time, the Xiongnu had just launched a major incursion into Chao County, killing the Beidi commander-in-chief. The emperor was worried about the Xiongnu threat, and finally asked Feng Teng: "Why do you know I cannot use Lian Po and Li Mu?" Feng Teng replied: "I heard that in ancient times, when a king sent out a general, he would kneel and push the carriage wheel, saying: 'Inside the city gate, I control it; outside the city gate, the general controls it.' Military achievements and rewards were decided outside, and then reported back. This is not an empty statement. My grandfather said that when Li Mu was Zhao's general at the border, the military market taxes were used to reward soldiers, rewards and punishments were decided outside, without interference from the center. Entrusted with authority and held accountable for success, so Li Mu could fully use his intelligence, sending out 1,300 chariots, 13,000 archers, and 100,000 elite soldiers, thus driving the Xiongnu north, defeating the Donghu, destroying the Danlin, suppressing the powerful Qin in the west, and supporting Han and Wei in the south. At that time, Zhao was close to dominating the land. Later, Zhao King You died, his mother was a singer. King You was enthroned, and under the influence of Guo Kai's slander, Li Mu was killed, and Yan Ju was made commander instead. The army was defeated and the soldiers fled, and Zhao was captured and destroyed by Qin. Now I have heard that Wei Shang is the governor of Yunzhong, using military market taxes to reward soldiers, spending private funds, sacrificing a cow every five days to entertain guests, military officers, and retainers, so the Xiongnu stayed away and did not approach Yunzhong's border. The enemy once entered, Wei Shang led chariots and cavalry to attack, killing many of them. The soldiers were all men's sons, farmers who joined the army, how would they know the rules? They fought hard all day, beheaded and captured the enemy, reported their achievements to the general's office, but one word did not match, and the legal clerks punished them according to the law. Their rewards were not given, but the officials strictly enforced the law. I am foolish, and I think the emperor's law is too strict, rewards too light, and punishments too heavy. Moreover, the governor of Yunzhong, Wei Shang, was punished for reporting six levels less than the actual enemy killed. The emperor ordered the case to be tried, stripped him of his title, and punished him. From this, it can be seen that even if you have Lian Po and Li Mu, you cannot use them. I am truly foolish,触犯禁忌, guilty of death, guilty of death!" Emperor Wen was pleased. That day, he ordered Feng Teng to hold a scepter and pardon Wei Shang, restore him as governor of Yunzhong, and appoint Feng Teng as commander of the chariot and cavalry, in charge of the imperial guards and regional chariot troops.

Seven years later, Emperor Jing ascended the throne, appointing Feng Teng as prime minister of Chu, later dismissed. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne and sought virtuous and capable men, Feng Teng was recommended. Feng Teng was then over ninety years old and could no longer serve, so Emperor Wu appointed Feng Teng's son, Feng Sui, as a郎. Feng Sui, courtesy name Wang Sun, was also an extraordinary person, and he was friendly with me.

The historian said: Zhang Ji's words were those of a wise and just man, upholding the law without flattery; Feng Gong's discussion of generals was profound! It is said, "To know a person, look at his friends." The two gentlemen's praises can be recorded in the palace. The Book of Documents says, "Not biased, not partisan, the king's way is vast; not partisan, not biased, the king's way is smooth." Zhang Ji and Feng Gong come close to this. [end of text]
