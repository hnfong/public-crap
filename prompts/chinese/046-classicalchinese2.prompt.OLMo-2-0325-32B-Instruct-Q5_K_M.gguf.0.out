(1) **Translation of the story into English:**

   Marquis Wen of Wei was planning matters and was always ahead of his ministers, none of whom could keep up with him. After court, he would show a joyful expression. Wu Qi stepped forward and said, "Have you ever heard a saying of King Zhuang of Chu from those around you?" Marquis Wen asked, "What was King Zhuang of Chu's saying?" Wu Qi replied, "King Zhuang of Chu, when planning matters and always being ahead of his ministers, would show a worried expression after court. The Duke of Shen, a minister named Wu, asked, 'Why do you look worried after court?' King Zhuang replied, 'It is worrisome that I plan matters without the aid of capable ministers who can keep up with me. This is why I am worried. It is based on the saying: "Among the feudal lords, the one who finds a good teacher becomes the king; the one who finds a good friend becomes the hegemon; the one who finds a good critic survives; and the one who plans everything by himself without anyone else being as good as him will perish." Now, with my lack of capable ministers who cannot keep up with me, how close is my state to perishing? This is why I am worried.' King Zhuang of Chu worried, while you, my lord, are joyful." Marquis Wen circled around twice and bowed deeply twice, saying, "Heaven has sent you to admonish the shortcomings of this insignificant ruler."

   **(2) Moral of the story:**

   The moral of the story is that a ruler should not be complacent when they are able to plan matters effectively on their own without the aid of capable ministers. Instead, they should worry about the lack of capable ministers, as it is a sign of potential weakness and vulnerability in the state. The story emphasizes the importance of surrounding oneself with competent and capable advisors and ministers, as they are essential for the state's prosperity and survival. It also suggests that a ruler should be concerned about the collective ability of their government rather than their own individual capability.

   **(3) Counterparts in Western (European) thought:**

   In Western thought, the concept of the importance of good advisors and ministers can be found in various political philosophies. For instance, the ancient Greek philosopher Plato, in his work "The Republic," discusses the ideal state and the importance of philosopher-kings who are wise and surrounded by competent advisors. Similarly, Niccolò Machiavelli in "The Prince" advises the ruler to be wary of flatterers and to seek the counsel of wise and experienced advisors. The idea that a ruler should not be isolated and should rely on the wisdom of others is also present in the European tradition of the "Council of State" or "Privy Council," where monarchs would consult with a group of experienced and knowledgeable advisors. The story from 荀子 echoes the European notion that a ruler's effectiveness is not solely dependent on their individual brilliance but also on the collective wisdom and competence of their government.
