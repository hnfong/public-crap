**The Biography of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang**

Zhang Shizhi, the Grand Administrator of Justice, was from Duyang, with the courtesy name Ji. He had an elder brother named Zhong who lived with him. Zhang was appointed as a Cavalry Officer and served Emperor Wen of Han for ten years without promotion, remaining unknown. Shizhi said, "Staying in office too long will deplete Zhong’s property, and I cannot fulfill my duty." He wished to resign and return home. The Central Commandant Yuan An recognized his talent and regretted his departure, so he requested that Shizhi be transferred to the position of Attendant of the Palace.

After Shizhi finished his morning duties, he took the opportunity to speak on matters of convenience. Emperor Wen said, "Speak humbly, do not discuss lofty matters, and make your words applicable to current affairs." Thus, Shizhi spoke of the affairs between Qin and Han, explaining why Qin failed and Han prospered at length. Emperor Wen praised him and appointed Shizhi as the Attendant of the Palace.

Shizhi accompanied the Emperor to the Tiger Enclosure. The Emperor asked the Overseer of the Upper Garden about the register of birds and beasts, asking over ten questions. The Overseer looked left and right but could not answer. A petty officer from the Tiger Enclosure answered the Emperor’s questions about the register of birds and beasts in detail, hoping to observe someone who could respond fluently and endlessly. Emperor Wen said, "Officials should not be like this! The Overseer is unreliable!" He then ordered Shizhi to appoint the petty officer as Overseer of the Upper Garden. Shizhi said beforehand, "Your Majesty, what do you think of the Marquis of Jing, Zhou Bo?" The Emperor said, "He is an upright man." Shizhi asked again, "What about the Marquis of Dongyang, Zhang Xiang?" The Emperor replied, "He is also an upright man." Shizhi said, "The Marquis of Jing and the Marquis of Dongyang are both called upright men, yet these two could not even speak when discussing matters. How could they compare to this petty officer, who is quick-witted and eloquent? Moreover, Qin relied on scribes and officials who competed in being swift, harsh, and meticulous. However, their flaws were merely superficial, lacking genuine compassion. Thus, their mistakes went unnoticed until the reign of the Second Emperor, when the empire collapsed like crumbling earth. Now, Your Majesty promotes this petty officer for his eloquence, but I fear the people will follow the trend, competing in eloquence without substance. Furthermore, the influence of inferiors on superiors is swift like an echo. Actions must be carefully considered." Emperor Wen said, "Well said." He then stopped and did not appoint the petty officer.

As the Emperor boarded his carriage, he called Shizhi to ride beside him. They moved slowly, and the Emperor asked Shizhi about the flaws of Qin. Shizhi answered frankly. Upon arriving at the palace, the Emperor appointed Shizhi as the Overseer of the Public Carriages.

Later, the Crown Prince and the Prince of Liang entered the court together in the same carriage and did not dismount at the Gate of the Marshal. Shizhi pursued and stopped them, preventing them from entering the palace gate. He then accused them of disrespect for not dismounting at the public gate and reported the matter. Empress Bo heard of this, and Emperor Wen took off his hat and apologized, saying, "I failed to teach my children properly." Empress Bo then sent an emissary to pardon the Crown Prince and the Prince of Liang, allowing them to enter. From then on, Emperor Wen admired Shizhi and appointed him as a Middle Great Officer.

Later, Shizhi became the Central Commandant. While traveling to Baling, he stayed in the north, overlooking the latrines. At that time, Lady Shen was with the Emperor. The Emperor pointed out the New Feng Road to Lady Shen and said, "This is the road to Handan." He ordered Lady Shen to play the *se*, and he himself leaned on the *se* and sang, his voice filled with sorrow and melancholy. He looked at the group of officials and said, "Alas! If one uses the stones of the Northern Mountains as a coffin, fills it with hemp and cotton, and seals it with lacquer, how could it be moved?" Those around him all said, "Well said." Shizhi stepped forward and said, "If there is anything desirable inside, even if it were chained to the Southern Mountains, there would still be a way out. If there is nothing desirable inside, even without a stone coffin, why would one grieve?" Emperor Wen praised him. Later, Shizhi was appointed as the Grand Administrator of Justice.

Later, while the Emperor was traveling and crossing the Zhongwei Bridge, a man ran out from under the bridge, startling the carriage horses. The Emperor then ordered cavalrymen to capture him and handed the case to the Grand Administrator of Justice. Shizhi investigated and said, "A commoner from the county came here and heard the sound of the Emperor’s arrival. He hid under the bridge. After a long time, assuming the Emperor had passed, he came out and saw the carriage and cavalry, so he ran away." According to the law, Qin Dang, the Grand Administrator of Justice, sentenced the man to a fine for violating the Emperor’s path. Emperor Wen was angry and said, "This man personally startled my horse. My horse was lucky to be gentle; if it were another horse, it might have injured me. Yet the Grand Administrator of Justice only fines him!" Shizhi said, "The law is something the Emperor shares with the people. If the law is like this and is made heavier, the people will not trust it. Moreover, at that time, if Your Majesty had ordered his immediate execution, it would have been done. Now that he has been handed to the Grand Administrator of Justice, the Grand Administrator of Justice is the judge of the land. If he is biased, then the application of the law across the land will be inconsistent, and the people will not know how to act. I hope Your Majesty will consider this carefully." After a long time, the Emperor said, "The Grand Administrator of Justice is correct."

Later, someone stole a jade armlet from the front of the Gao Temple. The thief was captured, and Emperor Wen was furious, ordering Shizhi to investigate. According to the law, stealing items used by the ancestors in the temple should be punished by execution. Shizhi reported this, and Emperor Wen was enraged, saying, "This person is wicked, stealing from the temple of the first Emperor. I entrusted the Grand Administrator of Justice to punish him by exterminating his entire family, but you follow the law and report it. This is not how I intended to uphold the will of the ancestors." Shizhi took off his hat, knelt, and apologized, saying, "The law is sufficient. Moreover, crimes may be equal, but their severity depends on whether they are committed in defiance or obedience. Now, stealing from the temple and exterminating the family—even if it were one in ten thousand cases—suppose a commoner took a handful of soil from Changling. How would Your Majesty punish him?" After a long time, Emperor Wen discussed this with Empress Bo, and they agreed that Shizhi’s judgment was correct. At that time, the Central Marshal, Marquis Zhou Yaofu, and the Chancellor of Liang, Marquis Shan Du Hou Wang Tian, admired Shizhi’s fair and balanced arguments, so they became close friends. From then on, Zhang Shizhi was renowned throughout the land.

After Emperor Wen’s death, Emperor Jing ascended the throne, and Shizhi feared punishment. He claimed to be ill and wished to resign, fearing severe retribution if he did not; yet he also feared seeing the Emperor to apologize, as he did not know how the Emperor would respond. Following Wang Sheng’s advice, he finally saw the Emperor to apologize, and Emperor Jing did not blame him.

Wang Sheng was skilled in the teachings of Huang-Lao and was a recluse. He was once summoned to the palace, where the Three Dukes and Nine Ministers all gathered. Wang Sheng, an old man, said, "My shoelaces are untied," and looked at Zhang Shizhi, saying, "Tie my shoelaces for me!" Shizhi knelt and tied them. Afterward, someone asked Wang Sheng, "Why did you humiliate Zhang Shizhi, making him kneel to tie your shoelaces?" Wang Sheng said, "I am old and lowly, and I know I can never benefit Zhang Shizhi. Zhang Shizhi is now a renowned minister of the land, so I humbled him by making him kneel to tie my shoelaces, intending to honor him further." The officials heard this and admired Wang Sheng while holding Shizhi in even higher regard.

Zhang Shizhi served Emperor Jing for over a year before becoming the Chancellor of the King of Huainan. He was still concerned about his past mistakes. After a long time, Shizhi died. His son, Zhang Zhi, with the courtesy name Changgong, held the position of an Officer but was dismissed. Because he could not adapt to the times, he never held office again.

Feng Tang’s grandfather was from Zhao. His father moved to Dai. When the Han dynasty was established, they moved to Anling. Tang was known for his filial piety and served as the Chief of the Central Commandant’s Office under Emperor Wen. When the Emperor’s carriage passed by, he asked Tang, "Old man, why are you serving as an Officer? Where is your home?" Tang answered honestly. The Emperor said, "When I was in Dai, my food taster Gao Kan often spoke to me of the virtue of Zhao’s general Li Qi. He fought at the Battle of Julu. Now, every time I eat, my mind is still at Julu. Do you know of this?" Tang replied, "He was not as good as Lian Po or Li Mu as a general." The Emperor asked, "Why?" Tang said, "My grandfather served in Zhao as an officer and was good friends with Li Mu. My father was once the Chancellor of Dai and knew Zhao’s general Li Qi, understanding his character." The Emperor, having heard of Lian Po and Li Mu’s characters, was delighted and struck his thigh, saying, "Alas! If only I had Lian Po and Li Mu as my generals, I would not worry about the Xiongnu!" Tang said, "Your Majesty! Even if you obtained Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them." The Emperor was angry and entered the forbidden palace. After a long time, he summoned Tang and scolded him, saying, "Why do you repeatedly humiliate me? Don’t you have any sense of propriety?" Tang apologized, saying, "I, a commoner, did not know what to avoid."

At that time, the Xiongnu had recently made a large incursion into Chaona, killing the Prefect of Beidi, Kang. The Emperor was concerned about the barbarian raids and finally asked Tang again, "How do you know I cannot use Lian Po and Li Mu?" Tang replied, "I have heard that in ancient times, when kings sent out generals, they would kneel and push the wheel, saying, 'Within the gate, I command; beyond the gate, the general commands.' Military rewards and promotions were all decided outside, and the general would report back. This was not mere talk. My grandfather said that Li Mu, as Zhao’s general on the border, used the taxes from the military market to entertain the soldiers, and rewards were decided outside without interference from the center. He was entrusted with responsibility and expected to achieve success, so Li Mu was able to fully utilize his intelligence and strength. He selected 1,300 chariots, 13,000 cavalry archers, and 100,000 soldiers with a bounty of 100 coins each. Thus, he drove back the Single Ati, defeated the Donghu, eliminated Tanlin, suppressed the strong Qin to the west, and supported Han, Wei to the south. At that time, Zhao nearly became hegemon. Later, when King Zhi of Zhao ascended the throne, his mother was a concubine. King Zhi used Guo Kai’s slander to eventually execute Li Mu and replace him with Yan Ju. Thus, the army was defeated, the soldiers fled north, and Zhao was captured and annihilated by Qin. Now, I have heard that Wei Shang, the Governor of Yunzhong, used all the market taxes to entertain the soldiers. He privately raised money, slaughtered a cow every five days to feast his guests, military officers, and attendants. Thus, the Xiongnu stayed far away and did not approach the Yunzhong pass. The barbarians had once invaded, but Wei Shang led his chariots and cavalry to strike them, killing many. The soldiers were all sons of farmers, rising from the fields to serve in the army. How would they know about military registers and ranks? They fought all day, cutting off heads and capturing prisoners, reporting their achievements to the Ministry of War. If they made even a minor mistake in their reports, the clerks would punish them according to the law. Rewards were not given, but officials strictly followed the law. I, being foolish, believe that Your Majesty’s laws are too clear, rewards too light, and punishments too harsh. Moreover, the Governor of Yunzhong, Wei Shang, was found to have a discrepancy of six levels in his reported achievements and captured prisoners. Your Majesty handed him to the officials, stripped his rank, and sentenced him to labor. From this, it can be seen that even if Your Majesty obtained Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them. I am truly foolish, touching on taboos, and deserve the death penalty!" Emperor Wen was pleased. That day, he ordered Feng Tang to carry the imperial seal and pardon Wei Shang, reinstating him as the Governor of Yunzhong, and appointed Tang as the General of Chariot Cavalry, overseeing the Central Marshal and the chariot soldiers of the commanderies and kingdoms.

Seven years later, Emperor Jing ascended the throne and appointed Tang as the Chancellor of Chu, but he was dismissed. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne and sought virtuous and capable men, he recommended Feng Tang. Tang was over ninety years old and could no longer serve as an official, so his son, Feng Sui, was appointed as an Attendant. Sui’s courtesy name was Wangsun, and he was also an extraordinary man, with whom I was acquainted.

The Grand Historian says: Zhang Ji’s words on upright men show that he upheld the law without bias; Feng Gong’s discussion on generals is profound! Profound! As the saying goes, "To know a person, observe his friends." The two gentlemen’s praises are worthy of being recorded in the ancestral temples. The Book of Documents says, "Without partiality or favoritism, the royal way is vast and smooth; without favoritism or partiality, the royal way is convenient and straightforward." Zhang Ji and Feng Gong were close to this ideal. [end of text]
