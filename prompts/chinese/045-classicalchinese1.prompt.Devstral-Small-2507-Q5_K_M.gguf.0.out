### Q1: Summary of the Story
West Gate Tao (西门豹) was appointed as the magistrate of Ye (邺). He discovered that the local people were suffering because they were forced to provide a bride for the River God (河伯). The local officials and priests would collect money from the people, use some of it to "marry" a girl to the River God, and keep the rest for themselves. West Gate Tao decided to put an end to this practice. He tricked the officials and priests into thinking that the River God was angry with them and had taken them away. After this, the practice stopped, and West Gate Tao implemented irrigation projects to benefit the people.

### Q2: Victims in the Story
The victims were usually young girls from poor families who were chosen to be the "bride" for the River God.

### Q3: Beneficiaries of the Old Practice
The local officials (三老), clerks (廷掾), and the priests (祝巫) benefited from the old practice as they collected and kept the money.

### Q4: Protagonist's Approach
West Gate Tao used a combination of wit and force. He tricked the officials and priests into thinking that the River God was angry and had taken them away, which was a clever strategy. He also used force by having the officials and priests thrown into the river, which was a bold and decisive action.

### Q5: Morality of the Protagonist's Actions
- **Utilitarian Perspective**: West Gate Tao's actions were moral because they benefited the majority of the people by stopping a harmful practice and improving their lives through irrigation.
- **Deontological Perspective**: Some might argue that his actions were immoral because he deceived and harmed the officials and priests, even if they were corrupt.
- **Virtue Ethics Perspective**: West Gate Tao's actions can be seen as moral because he acted with wisdom, courage, and a sense of justice to help the people.

### Q6: Explanation and Fairness of the Comment
The comment compares the governance styles of three officials:
- **Zi Chan (子产)**: People couldn't cheat under his rule.
- **Zi Jian (子贤)**: People didn't dare to cheat under his rule.
- **Xi Men Tao (西门豹)**: People didn't dare to cheat under his rule.

The comment suggests that while all three were effective, their methods and the reasons behind people's behavior differed. The comment is fair because it acknowledges the unique strengths of each official and the different ways they achieved good governance. It highlights that effective governance can be achieved through different means, and each official's approach was suitable for their context. [end of text]
