 中国历史上第一个有名有姓的皇后是汉武帝的妃子王Ζ widow, named Wang Zhengjun (王政君). 在她之前，中国的皇帝通常都有多位妃子，但没有明确的皇后之称。汉武帝在20年前选 coronated Wang Zhengjun 为皇后，她后来成为了汉朝的 longest-reigning empress.

Before Wang Zhengjun, the position of empress in China was not as clearly defined as it was in later dynasties. Empresses were typically chosen from the ranks of the emperor's many consorts, but they did not always hold a high degree of political power or influence. It was not until the Han dynasty that the role of the empress became more formalized and institutionalized.

Wang Zhengjun's reign as empress lasted for over 50 years, during which time she played an important role in court politics and helped to consolidate the power of the Han dynasty. She was known for her intelligence, grace, and political acumen, and her reign as empress was marked by a period of relative stability and prosperity for the Han dynasty. [end of text]
