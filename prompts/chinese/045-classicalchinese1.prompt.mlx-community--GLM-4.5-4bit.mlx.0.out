==========
**Q1:** The story describes how西门豹 (Ximen Bao), as the new magistrate of Ye, ended the corrupt practice of sacrificing young women to the river god He Bo. He exposed the scam by throwing the main perpetrators—the witch, her disciples, and the local elders—into the river, claiming they were slow to report back to the god. This terrified the locals and stopped the practice. He then built canals to irrigate the land, bringing lasting prosperity to the people of Ye.

**Q2:** The victims were young, beautiful girls from poor families.

**Q3:** The local "Three Elders" (三老), the clerks (廷掾), and the witch (祝巫) benefited. They collected millions in taxes, spent a fraction on the ritual, and divided the rest among themselves.

**Q4:** The protagonist used wits, not brute force. He didn't simply outlaw the practice or arrest the culprits. Instead, he cleverly turned the perpetrators' own superstition and ritual against them. By pretending to participate in the sacrifice and then sending the witch and elders to "report" to the river god, he created a situation where their failure to return proved the ritual was a fraud, dismantling the superstition from within.

**Q5:** The morality is debatable.
*   **From a utilitarian perspective:** It was moral. The act ended a cruel, exploitative practice that terrorized the populace, saved countless future lives, and led to the prosperity of the entire region. The deaths of a few corrupt individuals were a small price to pay for the greater good.
*   **From a deontological (rule-based) perspective:** It was immoral. Ximen Bao acted as judge, jury, and executioner, killing people without a trial. This violates fundamental principles of justice and the rule of law, regardless of the victims' crimes or the positive outcome.
*   **From a political realism perspective:** It was a necessary and effective act of governance. In a time and place where law was weak and superstition was strong, a direct, shocking demonstration was the only way to break the power of the corrupt local elite and establish his own authority.

**Q6:** The quote compares three famous governors: Zichan (子產), Zijian (子賤), and Ximen Bao (西門豹). It states:
*   Zichan's rule was so effective and intelligent that people *could not* deceive him.
*   Zijian's rule was so benevolent and virtuous that people *would not* bear to deceive him.
*   Ximen Bao's rule was so strict and fearsome that people *dared not* deceive him.

The comment asks which of the three is the most worthy. It is a fair and insightful comment because it highlights three distinct and valid styles of governance. It doesn't prescribe a single "best" method but forces the reader to consider the merits of each: intelligent administration, virtuous influence, and strict discipline. The question "who is most worthy?" is a philosophical prompt to debate the ideal qualities of a leader, making the comment a profound and fair concluding thought for the chapter.
