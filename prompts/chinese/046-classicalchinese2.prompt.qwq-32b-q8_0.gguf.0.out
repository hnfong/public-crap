Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a passage from Xunzi and wants three things: a translation, the moral, and a comparison to Western thought. 

First, the translation. I need to make sure I understand the original Chinese text. The story is about King Wǔ of Wèi who is pleased when his plans are successful and his ministers can't match him. Then Wú Qǐ reminds him of a story from Chu Zhuang Wang, who instead felt worried in the same situation. The key point is the difference between being happy vs. worried when one's plans are successful because of the implications for the kingdom's future.

I should translate the names as they are, like 魏武侯 as Wei Wuhou, 吳起 as Wu Qi, 楚莊王 as Chu Zhuangwang, and 申公巫臣 as Shen Gong Wuchen. Keep the proper nouns in Chinese but use the standard transliterations. Make sure the translation is accurate but also readable in English.

Next, the moral. The story contrasts the king's pride with the wise leader's humility. The moral is that a leader should not be complacent even when successful. The worry comes from the realization that if no one can match the leader's wisdom, there's no one to advise or challenge them, leading to potential downfall. The quote from Zhong Qiong emphasizes that having a teacher leads to dominance, a friend to hegemony, doubters to survival, but self-reliance leads to ruin.

Third part: Western counterpart. I need to think of similar concepts. The idea that a leader needs advisors and should be cautious of hubris is common. Maybe references to Greek philosophy like Aristotle's concept of phronesis (practical wisdom) requiring counsel. Also, the story of King Lear's hubris in Shakespeare, or the Roman concept of "pride goes before a fall." The quote from Proverbs 11:14 about counsel might be relevant. Also, the Delphic oracle's "know thyself" and warnings against hubris in Greek tragedies like Oedipus. So yes, there are parallels in Western thought about the dangers of arrogance and the importance of seeking wise counsel.

Wait, need to make sure the translation is correct. Let me check some key phrases again. "謀事而當" is "plans were appropriate" or "his plans were successful." "群臣莫能逮" means "no ministers could match him." The part where Chu Zhuangwang feels worried because no one can match him, leading to potential danger. The quote from Zhong Qiong is crucial here. 

Also, in the moral explanation, it's important to highlight that the worry stems from the lack of peers, which is a vulnerability. The leader should seek out advisors even if they are not as capable, to have different perspectives. 

For the Western counterpart, maybe also mention Machiavelli's advice in The Prince about the importance of good counsel, or the concept of "councils" in medieval governance. The idea that a king should have a council of advisors to prevent mistakes. Also, the story of King David seeking advice, or the Roman Senate's role. 

I think that covers the main points. Need to structure the answer clearly, first the translation, then the moral, then the Western counterpart. Make sure each part is concise but thorough.

### (1) Translation of the Story  
King Wǔ of Wèi had made a decision that proved correct, and none of his ministers could match his wisdom. After court, he wore a pleased expression. Wu Qi approached and asked, “Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuāng of Chǔ? Perhaps they could enlighten you?”  
King Wǔ replied, “What did King Zhuāng say?”  
Wu Qi answered, “Once, King Zhuāng of Chǔ made a decision that was flawless, and his ministers could not compare. Yet after court, he looked troubled. Shen Gong Wuchen asked, ‘Your Majesty, why do you wear a worried expression after court?’  
King Zhuāng replied, ‘When my plans are correct and no minister can match my judgment, this is why I am troubled. As Zhong Qi once said: “A ruler who finds a teacher among the feudal lords will dominate all under heaven; one who finds a friend will become a hegemon; one who finds doubters will survive; but one who relies solely on their own plans and sees no equal will perish.” Now, though I am unworthy, if my ministers cannot match me, does this mean our state is near ruin?’ King Zhuāng worried, yet you rejoice.”  
King Wǔ, realizing his mistake, bowed deeply and said, “Heaven has sent you to correct my error!”

### (2) Moral of the Story  
The story emphasizes **humility and the dangers of complacency in leadership**. King Wǔ’s pride at outthinking his ministers is contrasted with King Zhuāng’s wisdom in recognizing that a lack of peer challenge or critical feedback is a grave weakness. The key lesson is:  
- A leader should never take satisfaction in being unmatched in wisdom, as this isolation risks poor decisions and national decline.  
- True strength lies in seeking diverse perspectives, valuing advisors, and acknowledging that no one is infallible.  
- The quote from Zhong Qi underscores the hierarchy of leadership: having a mentor (teacher) leads to greatness, a peer (friend) to regional dominance, and even skepticism (doubters) ensures survival—only arrogance leads to ruin.

### (3) Western Counterparts  
Yes, the concepts in this story resonate with ideas in Western philosophy and literature:  

1. **The Danger of Hubris (Hybris)**:  
   - Greek tragedies (e.g., *Oedipus Rex*, *Agamemnon*) warn against excessive pride. Like King Wǔ, characters who dismiss others’ counsel face downfall.  
   - The biblical Proverbs 11:14 states, “Where there is no guidance, the people fall,” aligning with the idea that counsel is essential.  

2. **The Value of Counsel and Wisdom**:  
   - Aristotle’s *Nicomachean Ethics* stresses the importance of *phronesis* (practical wisdom), which requires listening to others for balanced judgment.  
   - Machiavelli’s *The Prince* advises rulers to surround themselves with honest advisors to avoid mistakes.  

3. **The “Socratic Paradox”**:  
   - Socrates famously claimed, “I know that I know nothing,” highlighting humility as a virtue. This mirrors King Zhuāng’s awareness of his own limitations.  

4. **Medieval and Renaissance Thought**:  
   - The concept of the “mirror of princes” (e.g., *The Prince* by Machiavelli or *The Book of the Courtier* by Castiglione) emphasizes rulers needing advisors to reflect their flaws and strengths.  

In essence, the story’s themes of humility, the peril of isolation, and the necessity of counsel find parallels in Western traditions that warn against arrogance and celebrate wise leadership through collaboration. [end of text]
