This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

Okay, I need to tackle this query about the passage from Xunzi. Let me start by understanding what's being asked. The user wants three things: a translation of the story, an explanation of its moral, and whether the concepts have counterparts in Western thought. 

First, the translation. The passage is in classical Chinese, so I need to make sure I get the nuances right. The names like 魏武侯 (King Wuling of Wei?), 吳起 (Wu Qi), 楚莊王 (King Chuang of Chu), and 申公巫臣 (Shen Gong Wuchen) should stay as they are. I'll need to parse each sentence carefully. For example, "謀事而當，群臣莫能逮" translates to something like "planned something appropriately, and none of the ministers could match him." The key part is the contrast between the king's happiness and Wu Qi's reference to Chuang Wang's worry. 

Next, the moral. The story is about humility and self-awareness. The king is proud because his ministers can't match his decisions, but Wu Qi points out that a wise ruler should be concerned because if no one can match him, it means he's isolated and the state is in danger. The quote from 中蘰 (maybe a sage?) about needing a teacher, friend, etc., reinforces that relying solely on oneself leads to downfall. So the moral is about the danger of complacency and the importance of having advisors who can challenge you.

For the third part, Western counterparts. The idea that a leader needs advisors and that isolation leads to failure is common. Maybe references to Greek philosophy like Aristotle's concept of phronesis (practical wisdom) requiring consultation, or Roman ideas about counsel. Also, the concept of "pride goes before a fall" from Proverbs. In political thought, Machiavelli might discuss the need for a prince to have good advisors. The quote about kings needing teachers, friends, etc., might parallel the medieval idea of the king's mirror, where advisors reflect his flaws. So yes, there are parallels in Western thought, especially in classical and medieval political philosophy.

Wait, I should check if 中蘰 is a known figure. Maybe it's a typo or a less-known name. If it's "Zhong Liu" or another sage, but since the user says to keep proper names in Chinese, I can just transliterate it as Zhong Liu or leave it as is. 

Also, in the translation, "天使夫子振寡人之過也" – "Heaven sent you to correct my mistake." The king is acknowledging his error, showing the importance of self-correction through wise counsel.

I need to ensure the translation is accurate but also readable. Maybe use "Your Majesty" for 不穀, which is a humble way for a ruler to refer to himself. 

For the moral explanation, emphasize that true leadership requires recognizing one's limitations and valuing others' input. The contrast between the two kings' reactions is key.

In the Western counterpart, maybe also mention the Greek concept of hubris leading to downfall, like in tragedies. Or the Roman idea of concilium (council) being essential for governance. The quote's structure (teacher, friend, etc.) might be similar to how different levels of advisorship are valued in Western texts. 

I think that covers the points. Now, structure the answer step by step as requested.

### (1) Translation of the Story  
King Wǔ of Wei had made a decision that was perfectly appropriate, and none of his ministers could match his wisdom. After court, he wore a pleased expression. Wu Qi approached and asked, “Have you ever heard the words of King Chuang of Chu? Perhaps they could be shared with you?”  
King Wǔ replied, “What did King Chuang say?”  
Wu Qi answered, “Once, when King Chuang made a decision that was perfectly appropriate, none of his ministers could match him. After court, he wore a worried expression. Shen Gong Wuchen asked, ‘Your Majesty, why do you look so troubled after court?’  
King Chuang replied, ‘When I make a decision and none of my ministers can match me, this is why I am worried. As Zhong Liu once said: *“A ruler who can find a teacher among his ministers will become a king, one who finds a friend will become a hegemon, one who finds a skeptic will survive, but one who plans alone and sees no one as his equal will perish.”* Now, though I am unworthy, none of my ministers can match me. Does this mean my state is near ruin? That is why I am worried.’  
King Chuang worried, but Your Majesty rejoices.”  
King Wǔ, taken aback, bowed twice and said, “Heaven has sent you to correct my mistake!”

### (2) Moral of the Story  
The story emphasizes the dangers of **hubris** and the importance of **self-awareness and humility** in leadership. King Wǔ’s pride in his own wisdom blinds him to the risks of isolation, while King Chuang’s humility allows him to recognize that a ruler who lacks advisors who can challenge or improve his decisions is doomed. The key lesson is that true strength lies not in being infallible but in seeking diverse perspectives and acknowledging one’s limitations. The quote from Zhong Liu underscores this: a leader’s success depends on their ability to surround themselves with wise mentors, trusted allies, or even critics—rather than assuming superiority over all.

### (3) Western Counterparts  
Yes, the concepts in this story have parallels in Western thought, particularly in classical and medieval political philosophy:  

1. **The Importance of Counselors**:  
   - Greek philosophers like Aristotle argued that rulers should seek advice from wise counselors (*phronimos*) to avoid errors of judgment (see *Nicomachean Ethics*).  
   - In Roman political thought, the idea of *consilium* (counsel) was central to governance, as seen in Cicero’s writings on the need for advisors to temper a leader’s decisions.  

2. **Hubris and Downfall**:  
   - The Greek concept of *hubris* (excessive pride) leading to downfall is a recurring theme in tragedies like *Oedipus Rex* or *Agamemnon*.  
   - The biblical proverb “Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall” (Proverbs 16:18) echoes the warning against self-satisfaction.  

3. **Levels of Leadership**:  
   - The hierarchy of “teacher, friend, skeptic” mirrors Western ideas about the ideal ruler. For example, Machiavelli in *The Prince* stresses the need for a leader to discern “good counselors” and avoid isolation.  
   - The medieval concept of the “king’s mirror” (as in the *Speculum Regale*) emphasized that a ruler’s virtue and wisdom could only be maintained through honest criticism from advisors.  

4. **Collective Wisdom**:  
   - The Enlightenment idea of checks and balances (e.g., Montesquieu’s separation of powers) reflects the belief that no single individual should hold unchecked authority, much like the story’s warning against solitary decision-making.  

In essence, the story’s themes align with Western traditions that value humility, the role of advisors, and the dangers of unchecked pride in leadership. [end of text]
