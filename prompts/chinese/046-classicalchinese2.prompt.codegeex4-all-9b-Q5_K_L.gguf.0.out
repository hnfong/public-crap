This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

(1) Translation:

Wu Wei, the Duke of Wei, was able to manage his affairs effectively and efficiently, and none of his ministers could match him. After he returned to his court, he showed a happy expression. Wu Chǔ, a minister, asked, "Have you ever heard the words of Chu Zhuang Wang, the King of Chu, from your attendants?" Wu Wei replied, "What are the words of Chu Zhuang Wang?" Wu Chǔ responded, "Chu Zhuang Wang was able to manage his affairs effectively and efficiently, and none of his ministers could match him. After he returned to his court, he showed a worried expression. Shen Gong and Wu Cheng, two of his ministers, asked, 'Why do you show a worried expression after returning to your court, my lord?' Chu Zhuang Wang replied, 'I, Chu Zhuang Wang, have managed my affairs effectively and efficiently, and none of my ministers could match me. Therefore, I am worried.' In the middle of my reign, I said, 'The kings who have their own teachers become kings, those who have their own friends become leaders, those who have their own doubts remain, and those who manage their own affairs and are unmatched by anyone else will perish.' Now, with my shortcomings, none of my ministers can match me, and my country is on the verge of collapse. Therefore, I am worried.' Chu Zhuang Wang showed worry, but you, my lord, showed happiness." Wu Wei paused for a moment and then bowed twice, saying, 'The gods have helped me to correct my shortcomings.'

(2) Moral of the story:

The moral of the story is that a leader should not be satisfied with their own abilities and achievements. Even if a leader is successful in managing their affairs, they should still be cautious and aware of their shortcomings. This is because a leader should always strive to improve and be better than their subordinates. If a leader is not satisfied with their own abilities, they will be more motivated to improve and will be able to lead their subordinates more effectively.

(3) Counterpart in Western (European) thought:

The concepts in the story have a counterpart in Western (European) thought. In the works of philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, the idea of a leader who is not satisfied with their own abilities and achievements is a common theme. These philosophers believed that a leader should always strive to improve and be better than their subordinates. This is because a leader should always be aware of their own shortcomings and should always be willing to learn and improve. This idea is also reflected in the works of political theorists like Machiavelli and Hobbes, who believed that a leader should always be cautious and aware of their own abilities and achievements.
