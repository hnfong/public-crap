Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang, Biographies

Zhang Shizhi, the Minister of Justice, was a native of Duyang, styled Zi Ji. He lived together with his elder brother Zhang Zhong. He obtained the position of Cavalry Gentleman through his family’s reputation, and served Emperor Wen of Han. For ten years he was unable to obtain an official post, and was not known for anything. Zhang Shizhi said, “Having served for a long time reduces my brother’s property, and does not bring success.” He wished to resign and return home. The Imperial Cavalier Attendant Yuan Ang recognized his talent and, regretting his departure, requested that Zhang Shizhi be transferred to serve as a Gentleman Cavalier. After Shizhi had finished court duties, he spoke of matters of benefit. Emperor Wen said, “Speak humbly, do not discuss lofty principles, let what you say be something that can be carried out.” Thus Shizhi spoke of the affairs between Qin and Han, why Qin had lost and why Han had risen, for a long time. Emperor Wen praised him and appointed him Gentleman Attendant to the Imperial Secretariat.

Shizhi accompanied the emperor on an outing and ascended the Tiger Enclosure. The emperor asked the Keeper of the Gardens of the Imperial Park about the records of the various beasts, asking more than ten questions. The Keeper looked left and right, but could not answer. The Keeper of the Tiger Enclosure, standing nearby, answered all the emperor’s questions about the records of the beasts in detail, wishing to show his ability to answer immediately without end. Emperor Wen said, “Is this how officials should be? The Keeper is shameless!” He then ordered Shizhi to appoint the Keeper as the Keeper of the Imperial Park. Shizhi stepped forward and said, “What do you think of Marquis of绛侯 Zhou Bo?” The emperor said, “He is a senior man.” Shizhi asked again, “What do you think of Marquis of东阳侯 Zhang Xiang?” The emperor again said, “He is a senior man.” Shizhi said, “Those two men, the Marquis of绛侯 and the Marquis of东阳侯, are called senior men, yet these two men could not speak a word when discussing affairs, how could they emulate this Keeper’s glib tongue and clever talk! Moreover, Qin employed officials who specialized in documents and statutes, and these officials competed to be swift, harsh, and scrutinizing, but their corruption was merely empty form, without the substance of compassion. Therefore, their faults were not heard, and they declined until the Second Qin Emperor, when the empire collapsed. Now you, because of the Keeper’s eloquence, have promoted him beyond his due, I fear the empire will follow the wind and drift, competing in eloquence without substance. Moreover, the transformation of the lower by the higher is faster than the shadow following the form; the raising and lowering of ranks must not be done carelessly.” Emperor Wen said, “Good.” He then stopped and did not appoint the Keeper.

The emperor mounted his carriage, summoned Shizhi to ride with him, and they walked slowly. He asked Shizhi about the faults of Qin, and Shizhi spoke of them in detail. When they arrived at the palace, the emperor appointed Shizhi as the Keeper of the Imperial Park.

Presently, the crown prince and the King of Liang rode in the same carriage to court, and did not dismount at the Sima Gate. Thus Shizhi stopped them and would not allow them to enter the palace gate. He then memorialized that they had not dismounted at the public gate, an act of disrespect, and submitted it. Empress Dowager Bo heard of it, and Emperor Wen removed his hat to apologize, saying, “I failed to teach my son properly.” Empress Dowager Bo then sent an envoy to carry the imperial decree to pardon the crown prince and the King of Liang, after which they were allowed to enter. Emperor Wen therefore regarded Shizhi as extraordinary and appointed him Gentleman Cavalier.

Presently, he became Gentleman Attendant. He accompanied the emperor on an outing to Baling, residing north of the mound. At that time, the Lady Shen accompanied him, and the emperor pointed out to her the road to Xinfeng, saying, “This is the way to Handan.” He made the Lady Shen play the se, and he leaned on the se and sang, his mind filled with sorrow and melancholy. He turned to the courtiers and said, “Alas! Let the northern stone be the coffin, use ramie floss to pad it, lacquer it inside, how could it be moved!” All around said, “Good.” Shizhi stepped forward and said, “If there is something desirable within, even if you seal the southern mountain, there will still be gaps; if there is nothing desirable within, even without a stone coffin, what sorrow is there!” Emperor Wen praised him. Afterwards, he appointed Shizhi as Minister of Justice.

Presently, the emperor was traveling on the Middle Wei River Bridge when a man ran out from under the bridge, startling the imperial carriage. The emperor sent riders to capture him and delivered him to the Minister of Justice. Shizhi questioned him. He said, “A person from the county came, heard the imperial procession, hid under the bridge. After a long time, thinking the procession had passed, he came out and saw the imperial carriage and horses, and ran away.” The Minister of Justice reported the sentence: one man violating the imperial procession should be fined. Emperor Wen was angry, saying, “This man startled my horse; my horse was gentle, but if it had been another horse, would it not have injured me? Yet the Minister of Justice only sentenced him to a fine!” Shizhi said, “The law is what the Son of Heaven shares with the empire. Now the law is like this, yet you would加重 it, which would make the law not trusted by the people. Moreover, at that time, if the emperor had ordered him to be executed on the spot, that would have been enough. Now that it has been sent to the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Justice is the balance of the empire; if he tilts, the law throughout the empire will be used as a scale, and the people will not know where to place their hands and feet. I beg Your Majesty to consider.” After a long time, the emperor said, “The Minister of Justice’s judgment is correct.”

Later, a man stole a jade disc from the ancestral temple of Emperor Gao, was captured, and Emperor Wen was angry, sending him to the Minister of Justice for trial. Shizhi examined the law: stealing ancestral temple utensils is a capital crime, and the sentence should be execution. Emperor Wen was furious, saying, “How inhuman! He stole the ancestral temple vessels, we who serve the ancestral temple wish to sentence him to execution, yet you sentence him according to the law, not in accordance with the spirit of our ancestral temple!” Shizhi removed his hat and kowtowed in apology, saying, “The law is sufficient as it is. Moreover, if the crimes are equal, they are distinguished by the order of rebellion and obedience. Now if someone steals ancestral temple vessels and is executed, if a foolish commoner were to take a handful of soil from Changling, what law would you add to him?” After a long time, Emperor Wen spoke to Empress Dowager Bo, and only then did he allow the Minister of Justice’s judgment. At that time, Marquis of条侯 Zhou Yafu and the Prime Minister of Liang, Marquis of山都侯 Wang Tiankai, saw that Shizhi’s judgment was fair and became close friends. Zhang Shizhi was thus praised throughout the empire.

Later, Emperor Wen died, and Emperor Jing ascended the throne. Shizhi was afraid and claimed to be ill. He wished to resign and return home, fearing that a great punishment would come; he wished to apologize, but did not know how. He used the plan of Master Wang and finally apologized; Emperor Jing did not blame him.

Master Wang was skilled in the words of Huang-Lao, a hermit. Once summoned to the court, the Three Ducal Ministers and the Nine Ministers all stood present. Master Wang, an old man, said, “My shoes are loose,” and turned to Zhang Shizhi, saying, “Tie my shoes for me!” Shizhi knelt and tied them. Afterward, someone said to Master Wang, “Why did you humiliate the Minister of Justice in court, making him kneel to tie your shoes?” Master Wang said, “I am old and lowly, and consider that I will never benefit the Minister of Justice. The Minister of Justice is a famous minister of the empire today; I deliberately humiliated the Minister of Justice, making him kneel to tie my shoes, to honor him.” When the courtiers heard this, they esteemed Master Wang and honored Zhang Shizhi.

Zhang Shizhi served Emperor Jing for more than a year as the Prime Minister of Huainan, still bearing the previous fault. After a long time, Shizhi died. His son Zhang Zhi, styled Chang Gong, reached the rank of Gentleman, and was dismissed. Because he could not gain favor in the world, he never served again.

Feng Tang, his great-grandfather was a native of Zhao. His father moved to Dai. At the rise of Han, he moved to Anling. Tang was known for filial piety and served as the head of the Cavalry Office, serving Emperor Wen. When Emperor Wen passed by in his carriage, he asked Tang, “Old man, why are you a Gentleman? Where is your home?” Tang answered truthfully. Emperor Wen said, “When I was in Dai, the Supervisor of Food Gao Qu often spoke to me of the merit of the Zhao general Li Qi, who fought at Julu. Now every time I eat, my mind is not on Julu. Do you know?” Tang replied, “He is not as good as Lian Po and Li Mu as generals.” The emperor said, “Why?” Tang said, “When my great-grandfather was in Zhao, he served as a military officer and knew Li Mu well. My father was a prime minister of Dai and knew the Zhao general Li Qi, and knew his character.” The emperor, having heard of Lian Po and Li Mu’s character, was greatly pleased and clapped his thigh, saying, “Alas! If I had Lian Po and Li Mu as my generals, how could I worry about the Xiongnu!” Tang said, “My lord! Even if you had Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them.” The emperor was angry and entered the inner palace. After a long time, he summoned Tang and rebuked him, saying, “Why did you humiliate me in public, is there no place to speak?” Tang apologized, saying, “I am ignorant and do not know the proprieties.”

At that time, the Xiongnu had newly invaded heavily into Chaona, killing the Commander of Beidi. The emperor was concerned about the Xiongnu, and asked Tang again, “How do you know I cannot use Lian Po and Li Mu?” Tang replied, “I have heard that in ancient times, when the kings sent generals, they knelt and pushed the carriage, saying, ‘Within the pass, I decide; outside the pass, the general decides.’ Military merit, ranks, and rewards are all decided outside, and reported upon return. This is not empty talk. My great-grandfather said that when Li Mu was general of Zhao, stationed at the border, the taxes from the military market were used to feed the soldiers, rewards were decided outside, not interfered with from the center. Entrusting responsibility and demanding results, Li Mu was able to use his full intelligence and wisdom, selecting one thousand three hundred chariots, ten thousand three thousand cavalry, one hundred thousand gold-class soldiers, thus driving north the Xiongnu, defeating the Donghu, destroying the Tanlin, suppressing the strong Qin to the west, and supporting Han and Wei to the south. At that time, Zhao was almost hegemonic. Later, when King of Zhao Yuan ascended the throne, his mother was a courtesan. King Yuan ascended the throne and used Guo Kai’s slander, eventually executing Li Mu and appointing Yan Ju as his replacement. Thus the army was defeated and the soldiers fled, and Zhao was captured and destroyed by Qin. Now I have heard that Wei Shang, the defender of Yunzhong, uses the taxes from the military market to feed the soldiers, and privately uses his own money, every five days he slaughters an ox, feasting guests, military officers, and attendants, thus the Xiongnu avoid him and do not approach the Yunzhong pass. Once the Xiongnu entered, Wei Shang led his chariots and cavalry to attack, killing many. The soldiers are all children of commoners, starting from the fields to serve in the army, how would they know the tallies and tally marks? They fight all day, beheading and capturing, reporting their merits to the military office, but if one word does not match, the clerks use the law to punish them. Their rewards are not given, but the clerks enforce the law must be used. I am foolish, thinking that Your Majesty’s law is too clear, rewards too light, punishments too heavy. Moreover, the Yunzhong defender Wei Shang was accused of underreporting the number of enemy heads by six, and the emperor sent him to the clerks, stripped his rank, and punished him. From this, it is said, Your Majesty, even if you had Lian Po and Li Mu, you would not be able to use them. I am truly foolish, offending taboos, guilty, guilty!” Emperor Wen was pleased. That day he ordered Feng Tang to carry the seal and pardon Wei Shang, restoring him as the defender of Yunzhong, and appointed Feng Tang as the Cavalry Commandant, in charge of the Imperial Cavalry and the cavalry of the commanderies and principalities.

In the seventh year, Emperor Jing ascended the throne and appointed Tang as the Prime Minister of Chu, and he was dismissed. When Emperor Wu ascended the throne, he sought virtuous and capable men, and recommended Feng Tang. At that time Tang was over ninety years old and could not serve again, so his son Feng Sui was appointed as a Gentleman. Sui, styled Wangsun, was also a remarkable man, and was on good terms with me.

The Grand Historian said: Zhang Ji’s words about the senior man, obeying the law without flattery; Feng Gong’s discussion of generals and commanders, has a flavor! Has a flavor! The saying goes, “If you do not know a person, look at his friends.” The praise of these two lords can be recorded in the ancestral temple. The Book of Documents says, “Not biased, not partial, the king’s way is broad; not partial, not biased, the king’s way is smooth.” Zhang Ji and Feng Gong are close to this. [end of text]
