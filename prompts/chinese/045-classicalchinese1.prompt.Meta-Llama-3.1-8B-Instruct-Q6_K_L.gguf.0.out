```
魏文侯时，西门豹为邺令。豹往到邺，会长老，问之民所疾苦。长老曰：「苦为河伯娶妇，以故贫。」豹问其故，对曰：「邺三老、廷掾常岁赋敛百姓，收取其钱得数百万，用其二三十万为河伯娶妇，与祝巫共分其余钱持归。当其时，巫行视小家女好者，云是当为河伯妇，即娉取。洗沐之，为治新缯绮縠衣，闲居斋戒；为治斋宫河上，张缇绛帷，女居其中。为具牛酒饭食，行十余日。共粉饰之，如嫁女床席，令女居其上，浮之河中。始浮，行数十里乃没。其人家有好女者，恐大巫祝为河伯取之，以故多持女远逃亡。以故城中益空无人，又困贫，所从来久远矣。民人俗语曰『即不为河伯娶妇，水来漂没，溺其人民』云。」西门豹曰：「至为河伯娶妇时，愿三老、巫祝、父老送女河上，幸来告语之，吾亦往送女。」皆曰：「诺。」

至其时，西门豹往会之河上。三老、官属、豪长者、里父老皆会，以人民往观之者三二千人。其巫，老女子也，已年七十。从弟子女十人所，皆衣缯单衣，立大巫后。西门豹曰：「呼河伯妇来，视其好丑。」即将女出帷中，来至前。豹视之，顾谓三老、巫祝、父老曰：「是女子不好，烦大巫妪为入报河伯，得更求好女，后日送之。」即使吏卒共抱大巫妪投之河中。有顷，曰：「巫妪何久也？弟子趣之！」复以弟子一人投河中。有顷，曰：「弟子何久也？复使一人趣之！」复投一弟子河中。凡投三弟子。西门豹曰：「巫妪弟子是女子也，不能白事，烦三老为入白之。」复投三老河中。西门豹簪笔磬折，向河立待良久。长老、吏傍观者皆惊恐。西门豹顾曰：「巫妪、三老不来还，柰之何？」欲复使廷掾与豪长者一人入趣之。皆叩头，叩头且破，额血流地，色如死灰。西门豹曰：「诺，且留待之须臾。」须臾，豹曰：「廷掾起矣。状河伯留客之久，若皆罢去归矣。」邺吏民大惊恐，从是以后，不敢复言为河伯娶妇。

西门豹即发民凿十二渠，引河水灌民田，田皆溉。当其时，民治渠少烦苦，不欲也。豹曰：「民可以乐成，不可与虑始。今父老子弟虽患苦我，然百岁后期令父老子孙思我言。」至今皆得水利，民人以给足富。十二渠经绝驰道，到汉之立，而长吏以为十二渠桥绝驰道，相比近，不可。欲合渠水，且至驰道合三渠为一桥。邺民人父老不肯听长吏，以为西门君所为也，贤君之法式不可更也。长吏终听置之。故西门豹为邺令，名闻天下，泽流后世，无绝已时，几可谓非贤大夫哉！

Here are the answers to the questions:

**Q1: Give a short summary of the story (5 points)**

The story is about West Gate Hound (西门豹), a wise and just official, who becomes the magistrate of Ye (邺). He discovers that the people of Ye are suffering because the officials are taking a large portion of their taxes to buy a wife for the River God (河伯). West Gate Hound decides to expose the corruption by pretending to participate in the ritual, but instead, he tricks the officials and the River God's wife by sending her and her disciples to their deaths in the river. He then uses the money to dig 12 canals to irrigate the fields, benefiting the people of Ye.

**Q2: What kind of women were usually the victims in the story (2 points)**

The victims were usually young women from poor families who were considered beautiful and were chosen to be the River God's wife. They were often taken from their homes and forced to undergo a series of rituals before being thrown into the river.

**Q3: Who were deemed to benefit from the old practice of offering girls? (2 points)

The officials, including the Three Elders (三老) and the Diviners (祝巫), benefited from the old practice as they would take a large portion of the taxes collected from the people to buy a wife for the River God and divide the remaining money among themselves.

**Q4: Did the protagonist use wits or force to deal with the situation? Explain (5 points)

West Gate Hound used a combination of wits and force to deal with the situation. He pretended to participate in the ritual and tricked the officials and the River God's wife by sending them to their deaths in the river. He also used his authority as a magistrate to order the execution of the officials and the River God's wife. However, his actions were not violent or brutal, and he used his intelligence and cunning to outwit his enemies.

**Q5: Was it moral for the protagonist to do so? Briefly provide views from various perspectives (10 points)

* From the perspective of the people of Ye, West Gate Hound's actions were moral as they brought an end to the corrupt practice and benefited the community.
* From the perspective of the officials, West Gate Hound's actions were immoral as they were deceived and punished for their corruption.
* From a utilitarian perspective, West Gate Hound's actions were moral as they brought the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people.
* From a deontological perspective, West Gate Hound's actions were immoral as they involved deception and the use of force.
* From a Confucian perspective, West Gate Hound's actions were moral as they promoted justice and fairness.

**Q6: At the end of 滑稽列传, it is said that: "傳曰：「子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。」三子之才能誰最賢哉？辨治者當能別之。" -- explain what it means, and whether the comment is fair. (15 points)

The comment is saying that the three officials, Zichan (子產), Ziqi (子賤), and West Gate Hound (西門豹), were able to govern their respective territories (Zheng, Shanfu, and Ye) in such a way that the people were unable to deceive them, unwilling to deceive them, and did not dare to deceive them, respectively. The comment is asking which of the three officials was the most virtuous.

The comment is fair as it highlights the different strengths of each official. Zichan was able to govern Zheng in such a way that the people were unable to deceive him, indicating his wisdom and integrity. Ziqi was able to govern Shanfu in such a way that the people were unwilling to deceive him, indicating his fairness and justice. West Gate Hound was able to govern Ye in such a way that the people did not dare to deceive him, indicating his authority and effectiveness. However, the comment does not provide a clear answer to which official was the most virtuous, leaving it up to the reader to decide.
