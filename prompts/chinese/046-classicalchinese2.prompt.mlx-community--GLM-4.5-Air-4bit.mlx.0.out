**English Translation:**
> When Marquis Wu of Wei made decisions that were always correct, none of his ministers could match his wisdom. After court sessions, he would leave with a pleased expression. Wu Qi stepped forward and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu?" The Marquis asked, "What were King Zhuang's words like?" Wu Qi replied: "King Zhuang of Chu also made decisions that were always correct, and none of his ministers could match his wisdom. Yet after court, he would leave with a worried expression. Shen Gong Wuchen approached and asked, 'Your Majesty, why do you look worried after court?' King Zhuang replied: 'I make correct decisions, and none of my ministers can match me, and that is why I worry. As the saying goes: 'A ruler who finds a teacher among his subjects will become a true king (王); one who finds a friend will become a hegemon (霸); one who finds someone who challenges him will survive (存); but one who relies only on his own wisdom, with no one to match or surpass him, is doomed to perish (亡).' Now, given my unworthiness, if none of my ministers can match me, is my kingdom not close to ruin? That is why I worry." King Zhuang worried, while you, my lord, are pleased." The Marquis, deeply moved, bowed twice and said: "Heaven has sent you, Master, to correct my faults."

### (2) Moral of the Story

The moral of the story is that **a ruler's true wisdom lies not in their own unassailable competence, but in their ability to surround themselves with capable advisors who can challenge and match their intellect**. 

- **Marquis Wu of Wei** initially takes pride in being the only one who can make correct decisions, which leads to complacency (he is "pleased"). 
- **King Zhuang of Chu**, however, worries when he realizes no one can match him, fearing this indicates a lack of talent in his kingdom and thus impending decline. 
- **Wu Qi** uses this contrast to admonish the Marquis, arguing that a ruler should seek out ministers who can "match or surpass" them (得師者王, "find a teacher among his subjects to become a true king"). 

The core message aligns with Confucian and Legalist ideals of governance: a strong ruler must cultivate a court of talented individuals to avoid stagnation and ensure the long-term health of the state. Pride in personal superiority is dangerous; humility and a commitment to collective wisdom are virtues.

### (3) Counterpart in Western Thought

Yes, the concepts in this story have strong parallels in Western political philosophy, particularly in the works of **Plato** and **Aristotle**, as well as later thinkers like **Machiavelli** and **Montesquieu**. Here are key counterparts:

#### **Plato's *Republic* (Philosopher-King and the Role of Advisors)**
- Plato argues that the ideal ruler (the "philosopher-king") must be wise but also surrounded by other guardians who can challenge and refine their wisdom. This mirrors King Zhuang's worry about lacking capable ministers. 
- The idea that a ruler should "find a teacher" (得師者王) aligns with Plato's emphasis on education and dialectic debate as paths to truth.

#### **Aristotle's *Politics* (The Virtuous Ruler and the Need for Counsel)**
- Aristotle stresses that a good ruler must be virtuous and open to counsel, as individual judgment is fallible. He criticizes rulers who act as "sole masters" (analogous to Marquis Wu's initial pride), arguing this leads to tyranny or decline.

#### **Machiavelli's *The Prince* (The Dangers of Complacency)**
- Machiavelli warns rulers against becoming isolated or overly confident, as this blinds them to threats. He advises princes to "listen to truth" even when unpleasant, much like Wu Qi's rebuke to the Marquis.

#### **Montesquieu's *The Spirit of the Laws* (Separation of Powers and Checks)**
- Montesquieu's theory of checks and balances reflects the story's moral: power must be distributed to prevent stagnation. A ruler with no "matching" ministers risks autocratic decay.

#### **Roman Thought (Cicero's *On the Republic*)**
- Cicero emphasizes that a res publica ("public thing") thrives when leaders debate and challenge one another, echoing the Chinese ideal of "得疑者存" (surviving through challenge).

#### **Enlightenment Thinkers (Voltaire, Rousseau)**
- Voltaire quipped, "I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it," underscoring the value of dissent. Rousseau's *Social Contract* argues that collective wisdom surpasses individual rule.

In summary, the story's themes—**the danger of unchecked competence, the value of advisory challenges, and the link between humility and good governance**—resonate deeply with Western political philosophy, from ancient Greece to the Enlightenment. The parallel is particularly strong in the shared belief that **no ruler is infallible, and a state's health depends on its ability to cultivate and heed critical counsel**.</think>### (1) English Translation of the Passage
