Here is a possible first line of the poem, written in the style of the ancient Chinese poet Li Bai:

"The waves crash upon the shore,
As the sun sets behind the mountains."

This poem follows the structure of a traditional Chinese poem, with the first line introducing the scene and setting the mood. The next lines will continue to describe the scene, using vivid imagery and sensory details to bring it to life.
