Got it, let's tackle these questions one by one. First, I need to make sure I understand the text thoroughly. It's about西门豹 (Xi Men Bao) in Wei文侯's time, who becomes the magistrate of Ye. He finds out that the local elders, officials, and witches are exploiting the people by pretending to marry girls off to the River God (河伯), taking their money. He then confronts them by "sending" the witch and elders to the river themselves, stopping the practice, and then digs canals to benefit the people.

Starting with Q1: Short summary. Need to hit the key points:西门豹到邺，问民疾苦，发现河伯娶妇的骗局（三老、廷掾、巫祝敛财，害少女），设计将巫婆、三老投入河中，制止陋习，然后兴修水利（十二渠），百姓受益，后世怀念。

Q2: What kind of women were victims? The text says "巫行视小家女好者，云是当为河伯妇" – so young, good-looking girls from poor families ("小家女好者").

Q3: Who benefited from the old practice? The text mentions "邺三老、廷掾常岁赋敛百姓...与祝巫共分其余钱持归" – so the three elders (三老),廷掾 (local officials), and the witches (祝巫) shared the money.

Q4: Wits or force? He used wits. Instead of openly confronting with force, he pretended to go along with the ritual, then used their own logic against them: since they claimed the River God needs a good wife, he sent the witch and elders to "report" first, which made the perpetrators panic and admit the fraud. No direct force against the people, just outsmarting the exploiters.

Q5: Moral? Perspectives: From utilitarianism, yes – he ended a harmful practice that caused poverty and loss of life, benefited the majority. From deontology (rights), maybe some debate: did he have the right to kill the witch and elders? But they were the ones perpetuating violence against innocent girls, so it's justified as punishment for their crimes. From the perspective of the text, it's praised as "贤大夫" (virtuous official), so the author (Sima Qian) considers it moral. Also, the people were grateful later, so societal approval.

Q6: The quote compares three officials:子产 (Zhi Chan) in Zheng – people can't deceive him (wise, discerning);子贱 (Zi Jian) in Shanfu – people don't dare to deceive him out of kindness (仁政);西门豹 in Ye – people don't dare to deceive him because of fear (威刑). The question is who is the most贤 (virtuous). Is the comment fair? The comment is a prompt for debate, not a direct judgment. Sima Qian lists them to show different governance styles: Zhi Chan uses wisdom, Zi Jian uses virtue, Xi Men Bao uses authority. "Fair" depends on values – if virtue (仁) is highest, Zi Jian might be best; if effectiveness, all are贤. The text says "辨治者當能別之" (those who understand governance can distinguish), so it's a fair observation of different methods, not an unfair ranking.

Now need to make sure answers are concise, hit all points, and use the text evidence.</seed:think>### Q1: Summary  
Xi Men Bao, as magistrate of Ye, learned of the local scam: elders, officials, and witches falsely claimed to marry girls to the River God, extorting taxes and sacrificing poor, good-looking girls. He pretended to participate in the ritual, then "sent" the witch and elders to the river themselves, terrifying the perpetrators into halting the practice. He then led the people to dig 12 canals, irrigating fields and bringing long-term prosperity. His wisdom and governance were remembered forever.  


### Q2: Victim Women  
Young, attractive girls from poor families ("小家女好者").  


### Q3: Beneficiaries of the Old Practice  
Local elites: three elders (三老),廷掾 (local officials), and witches (祝巫), who shared the extorted money.  


### Q4: Wits or Force?  
He used **wits**. Instead of direct force, he exploited the ritual’s own logic: by claiming the "River God needed a better wife," he had the witch and elders "report" first, throwing them into the river. This made the exploiters panic and confess, without harming innocent people. It was a strategic deception to dismantle the fraud.  


### Q5: Morality of His Actions  
- **Utilitarian view**: Moral. He ended a practice that caused poverty, population loss, and injustice, benefiting the majority.  
- **Retributive justice**: The witch and elders were perpetrators of violence (sacrificing girls, stealing money); their punishment was justified as accountability.  
- **Textual approval**: Sima Qian calls him a "贤大夫" (virtuous official), and later generations honored his canals, indicating societal endorsement.  
- **Minor critique**: Some might question killing, but the victims were already being killed; his action was a necessary deterrent.  


### Q6: Explanation and Fairness  
The quote compares three governance styles:  
- **Zhi Chan (子产)**: People "can’t deceive" him (wise, discerning).  
- **Zi Jian (子贱)**: People "don’t dare deceive" him (benevolent, winning trust).  
- **Xi Men Bao**: People "don’t dare deceive" him (authoritative, using fear).  

**Fairness**: The comment is fair as it highlights *different effective methods*, not ranks. It acknowledges that virtue (Zi Jian), wisdom (Zhi Chan), and authority (Xi Men Bao) all achieve governance—"贤能" (virtue) depends on perspective: if "仁" (benevolence) is top, Zi Jian wins; if "effectiveness," all are贤. The text leaves judgment to "辨治者" (those who understand governance), making it a balanced observation. [end of text]
