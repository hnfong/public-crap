## Answers to 滑稽列传 Questions:

**Q1: Give a short summary of the story (5 points)**

Westmen Bao, as magistrate of Ye, discovered the local people were impoverished by a yearly ritual of "marrying" a girl to the River God (He Bo) orchestrated by the elders, officials, and shamans who pocketed the money collected from the people. He exposed the fraud by demanding they send the shamans and elders to deliver the "bride" to the river, ultimately throwing them in himself. This act of intimidation ended the practice, and he then implemented irrigation canals to benefit the people, leading to prosperity and lasting respect.

**Q2: What kind of women were usually the victims in the story (2 points)**

Young, pretty girls were the victims. The shamans would look for "good-looking" girls and force their families to participate in the ritual.

**Q3. Who were deemed to benefit from the old practice of offering girls? (2 points)**

The elders (三老), court officials (廷掾), and shamans (巫祝) benefited financially from collecting money from the people under the guise of offering girls to the River God.

**Q4: Did the protagonist use wits or force to deal with the situation? Explain (5 points)**

The protagonist, Westmen Bao, primarily used **force and intimidation**, disguised as a logical extension of their own fraudulent practice. He didn't argue the morality of the ritual initially; he *participated* in it, demanding the elders and shamans fulfill their own requirements.  He used the absurdity of their ritual against them, forcing them to confront the consequences of their actions by physically throwing them into the river. While clever in exploiting their hypocrisy, it was a demonstrative act of power, not reasoned persuasion.

**Q5: Was it moral for the protagonist to do so? Briefly provide views from various perspectives (10 points)**

*   **Utilitarian Perspective:** Highly moral. His actions, though extreme, saved many people from poverty and suffering, and brought lasting benefits to the community. The ends justified the means.
*   **Deontological Perspective:** Immoral.  Deliberately killing people, even corrupt ones, is inherently wrong, regardless of the outcome. His actions were a violation of basic human rights.
*   **Confucian Perspective:**  Potentially justifiable, but problematic. While a ruler should prioritize the welfare of the people, the method used was too harsh and lacked proper legal process. A more measured approach, focusing on education and reform, would have been preferable.
*   **Modern Legal Perspective:**  Clearly immoral and illegal. Murder is a crime, even if the victim is corrupt.

**Q6: At the end of 滑稽列传, it is said that: "傳曰：「子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。」三子之才能誰最賢哉？辨治者當能別之。" -- explain what it means, and whether the comment is fair. (15 points)**

This passage compares the governing styles of three officials: Zichan (governed Zheng where people *could not* deceive him), Zixian (governed Danfu where people *would not* deceive him), and Westmen Bao (governed Ye where people *dared not* deceive him).

The statement means that each official achieved order through different means:

*   **Zichan:**  Achieved respect and trustworthiness through his virtue and clear laws. People were afraid to deceive him because of his integrity and ability to discern truth.
*   **Zixian:**  Earned the people's affection and loyalty through kindness and benevolence. They *chose* not to deceive him because they loved and respected him.
*   **Westmen Bao:**  Instilled fear through his ruthless actions. People were afraid to deceive him because they feared the consequences.

**Is the comment fair?**  It's partially fair, but leans towards being **unfair to Westmen Bao**.  The passage subtly implies Zichan and Zixian were superior rulers because their governance relied on positive qualities (virtue and benevolence) rather than fear.  While Westmen Bao was effective, his method was based on intimidation and violence.  A truly discerning ruler would recognize that governance based on fear is less stable and sustainable than governance based on trust and respect.  The comment highlights the *quality* of order achieved, not just the *existence* of order
