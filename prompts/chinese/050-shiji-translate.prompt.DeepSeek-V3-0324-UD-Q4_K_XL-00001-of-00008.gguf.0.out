**Biographies of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang**  

Zhang Shizhi, the Commandant of Justice, was a native of Duyang, with the courtesy name Ji. He had an elder brother named Zhong, with whom he lived together. Using his family wealth, he became a cavalry attendant and served Emperor Xiaowen, but after ten years without promotion, he remained unknown. Zhang Shizhi said, "A long tenure in office has diminished my brother’s wealth, yet I have achieved nothing." He wished to resign and return home. The General of the Palace Guard, Yuan Ang, recognizing his worth and regretting his departure, requested that Zhang Shizhi be transferred to serve as an attendant. After the court session, Zhang Shizhi took the opportunity to present matters of expediency to the emperor. Emperor Wen said, "Keep it modest—do not aim too high—so that it can be implemented now." Thereupon, Zhang Shizhi spoke at length about the affairs between the Qin and Han dynasties, why Qin fell and Han rose. Emperor Wen praised him and appointed him as Chief Attendant.  

Zhang Shizhi accompanied the emperor on an excursion to the tiger enclosure. The emperor questioned the Director of the Shanglin Park about the animal registers, but after more than ten questions, the director looked around helplessly and could not answer. The keeper of the tiger enclosure, standing nearby, answered the emperor’s questions about the registers in great detail, wishing to display his ability to respond fluently and endlessly. Emperor Wen said, "Should not an official be like this? The director is useless!" He then ordered Zhang Shizhi to promote the keeper to the position of Director of Shanglin. After a long pause, Zhang Shizhi stepped forward and said, "What does Your Majesty think of Marquis of Jiang, Zhou Bo?" The emperor replied, "A man of virtue." Zhang Shizhi asked again, "And what of Marquis of Dongyang, Zhang Xiangru?" The emperor again said, "A man of virtue." Zhang Shizhi said, "Marquis of Jiang and Marquis of Dongyang are both called men of virtue, yet these two could hardly speak when presenting matters. How could they imitate this keeper’s glib and rapid speech? Moreover, Qin relied on clerks who wielded brushes, and officials competed in harshness and severity, but their methods were mere formalities without genuine compassion. Thus, their faults went unnoticed, and by the time of the Second Emperor, the empire collapsed. Now, if Your Majesty promotes this keeper for his eloquence, I fear the world will follow this trend, competing in empty talk without substance. The influence of superiors spreads faster than shadows and echoes—actions must be carefully considered." Emperor Wen said, "Well said." He then halted the keeper’s promotion.  

The emperor mounted his carriage and summoned Zhang Shizhi to ride alongside him. As they proceeded slowly, he asked Zhang Shizhi about the failings of Qin. Zhang Shizhi answered truthfully. Upon returning to the palace, the emperor appointed him as Director of the Public Carriages.  

Soon after, the crown prince and the King of Liang entered the palace together in a carriage without dismounting at the Sima Gate. Zhang Shizhi pursued and stopped them, preventing them from entering the palace gates. He then impeached them for failing to dismount at the public gate, an act of disrespect, and submitted a memorial. When Empress Dowager Bo heard of this, Emperor Wen removed his cap and apologized, saying, "I failed to teach my sons properly." Empress Dowager Bo then sent an envoy with an edict pardoning the crown prince and the King of Liang, after which they were allowed to enter. Emperor Wen, impressed by Zhang Shizhi, appointed him as Grand Master of the Palace.  

Later, he rose to General of the Palace Guard. While accompanying the emperor to Baling, they stood at the northern side overlooking the tomb. Empress Shen was also present. The emperor pointed to the road leading to Xinfeng and said, "This is the road to Handan." He had Empress Shen play the zither, and he leaned against it while singing, his mood somber and sorrowful. Turning to his ministers, he said, "Alas! If my coffin were made of stone from the northern mountains, bound with hemp and lacquered, who could move it?" The attendants all said, "Excellent." Zhang Shizhi stepped forward and said, "If there is something desirable inside, even sealing it with Mount Nan would leave gaps. If there is nothing desirable, even without a stone coffin, what is there to worry about?" Emperor Wen praised him. Later, he appointed Zhang Shizhi as Commandant of Justice.  

On another occasion, the emperor was crossing the Zhongwei Bridge when a man emerged from beneath it, startling the imperial horses. The emperor had him arrested and handed over to the Commandant of Justice. Zhang Shizhi interrogated him, and the man said, "I am a villager. Hearing the imperial procession, I hid under the bridge. After a long time, thinking it had passed, I came out and saw the imperial carriage, so I ran." The Commandant of Justice ruled that the man had violated the imperial procession and should be fined. Emperor Wen angrily said, "This man personally startled my horse! Fortunately, my horse is gentle—had it been another, I might have been injured! Yet the Commandant only fines him?" Zhang Shizhi replied, "The law is shared by the Son of Heaven and the people. If the law is thus and you make it harsher, the people will not trust it. At the time, had you ordered his immediate execution, it would have sufficed. But since he was handed to the Commandant, whose duty is to uphold impartial justice, any deviation would cause the world’s laws to be applied unevenly. How then would the people know how to act? I beg Your Majesty to consider this." After a long silence, the emperor said, "The Commandant’s judgment is correct."  

Later, someone stole a jade ring from the altar of the Gaomiao Temple. The thief was caught, and Emperor Wen, furious, handed him to the Commandant of Justice. Zhang Shizhi, following the law that theft of imperial temple artifacts warranted execution, sentenced the thief to public execution. The emperor angrily said, "This man, devoid of morality, dared to steal from the temple of my ancestors! I handed him to the Commandant intending his extermination, yet you rule according to the law—this is not how I wish to honor my ancestors!" Zhang Shizhi removed his cap and kowtowed, saying, "The law is sufficient as it stands. Crimes may be equal, but their gravity differs. If we exterminate a clan for stealing a temple artifact, what punishment would Your Majesty impose if some fool took a handful of earth from the Changling Mausoleum?" After a long deliberation, Emperor Wen discussed it with Empress Dowager Bo and accepted the Commandant’s judgment. At this time, the Commandant of the Capital Guards, Marquis of Tiao, Zhou Yafu, and the Chancellor of Liang, Marquis of Shandu, Wang Tiankai, admired Zhang Shizhi’s impartiality and befriended him. From then on, Zhang Shizhi was praised throughout the land.  

After Emperor Wen’s death, Emperor Jing ascended the throne. Zhang Shizhi, fearing reprisal, feigned illness. He wished to resign but feared severe punishment; he considered apologizing but did not know how. Following Wang Sheng’s advice, he eventually apologized, and Emperor Jing did not hold it against him.  

Wang Sheng was a recluse skilled in the teachings of Huang-Lao. Once, he was invited to court, where all the high officials stood assembled. The elderly Wang Sheng said, "My shoelace is loose," and turned to Zhang Shizhi, saying, "Tie it for me!" Zhang Shizhi knelt and tied it. Afterward, someone asked Wang Sheng, "Why did you publicly humiliate the Commandant by making him kneel to tie your shoe?" Wang Sheng replied, "I am old and lowly, knowing I can never benefit the Commandant. But he is a renowned minister of the empire—I merely wished to slight him publicly so that by kneeling to tie my shoe, his reputation would grow." The officials, hearing this, admired Wang Sheng and esteemed Zhang Shizhi even more.  

Zhang Shizhi served Emperor Jing for over a year before being appointed as Chancellor to the King of Huainan, likely due to past offenses. After some time, he passed away. His son, Zhang Zhi, courtesy name Changgong, rose to the rank of Grand Master but was dismissed. Unable to conform to the times, he never held office again.  

Feng Tang’s grandfather was from Zhao. His father moved to Dai, and after the Han’s rise, they relocated to Anling. Feng Tang was known for his filial piety and served as Chief of the Palace Guard under Emperor Wen. Once, as the emperor passed by in his carriage, he asked Feng Tang, "Why is an elder like you still a guard? Where is your home?" Feng Tang answered truthfully. The emperor said, "When I lived in Dai, my chief steward, Gao Qu, often spoke of the valor of Zhao’s general Li Qi at the Battle of Julu. Even now, whenever I eat, my thoughts linger on Julu. Do you know of this?" Feng Tang replied, "He was not as great as Lian Po and Li Mu." The emperor asked, "Why?" Feng Tang said, "My grandfather served in Zhao as a commander and knew Li Mu well. My father was once Chancellor of Dai and knew Zhao’s general Li Qi—I know their character." Hearing of Lian Po and Li Mu’s deeds, the emperor was delighted and slapped his thigh, exclaiming, "Alas! If only I had Lian Po and Li Mu as my generals—would I then fear the Xiongnu?" Feng Tang said, "Forgive me, Your Majesty! Even if you had Lian Po and Li Mu, you could not use them." Enraged, the emperor rose and entered the inner chambers. After a long while, he summoned Feng Tang and rebuked him, "Why humiliate me publicly? Could you not have spoken in private?" Feng Tang apologized, "This humble man knows no restraint."  

At that time, the Xiongnu had recently invaded Chaona, killing the Commandant of Beidi, Ang. Concerned about the northern threat, the emperor finally asked Feng Tang, "How do you know I could not use Lian Po and Li Mu?" Feng Tang replied, "I have heard that when ancient kings dispatched generals, they knelt and pushed the chariot’s axle, saying, ‘Affairs within the gates are mine; affairs beyond are the general’s.’ Military rewards were decided on the field and reported afterward. This was no empty talk. My grandfather said Li Mu, as Zhao’s border general, used market taxes to feed his troops, deciding rewards himself without court interference. Entrusted with full authority, he could fully employ his wisdom, assembling 1,300 chariots, 13,000 skilled archers, and 100,000 elite soldiers, driving the Xiongnu north, crushing the Donghu, annihilating the Danlin, resisting Qin in the west, and repelling Han and Wei in the south. At that time, Zhao nearly achieved hegemony. Later, when King Qian of Zhao ascended—his mother being a courtesan—he listened to Guo Kai’s slander, executed Li Mu, and replaced him with Yan Ju. Thus, Zhao’s army was crushed, and it fell to Qin. Now, I have heard Wei Shang, Governor of Yunzhong, uses market taxes to feed his troops and his own funds to feast officers every five days, keeping the Xiongnu at bay. Once, when the enemy invaded, Wei Shang led his forces, killing many. His soldiers are farmers’ sons, ignorant of military records. They fight all day, yet if their reports differ slightly, clerks punish them. Rewards are withheld, but penalties are enforced. I foolishly believe Your Majesty’s laws are too strict, rewards too meager, punishments too harsh. Wei Shang was accused of misreporting six enemy heads—you stripped his rank and sentenced him to hard labor. Thus, even with Lian Po and Li Mu, you could not use them. Forgive my bluntness—I deserve death!" Emperor Wen was pleased. That day, he sent Feng Tang with an edict pardoning Wei Shang and reinstating him as Governor of Yunzhong, while appointing Feng Tang as Commandant of Cavalry, overseeing capital and provincial forces.  

Seven years later, Emperor Jing ascended and made Feng Tang Chancellor of Chu, but he was later dismissed. When Emperor Wu sought worthy men, Feng Tang was recommended, but he was over ninety and could not serve. Instead, his son Feng Sui became a palace guard. Sui, courtesy name Wangsun, was also an extraordinary man and a friend of mine.  

The Grand Historian remarks: Zhang Ji’s words about men of virtue and his unwavering adherence to the law; Feng Gong’s discourse on generals—how profound! As the saying goes, "To know a man, look at his friends." The praises of these two men deserve to be recorded in the court annals. The *Book of Documents* states, "Without partiality or faction, the kingly way is vast; without faction or partiality, the kingly way is smooth." Zhang Ji and Feng Gong came close to this.
