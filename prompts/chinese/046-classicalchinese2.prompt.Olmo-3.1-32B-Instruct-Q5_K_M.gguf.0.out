### (1) Translation of the Story into English

Here is a clear translation of the passage from 荀子 (Xunzi), with proper names in Chinese as requested:

---

**Wu Marquis of Wei (魏武侯) was deliberating on important matters and, when he did so, none of his ministers could match his insight. After the court session ended, he had a look of joy on his face. Wu Risi (吳起) stepped forward and said:**

*"I once heard the following about King Zhao of Chu (楚莊王). When people nearby heard about his deliberations, none of his ministers could keep up with him. After court, he looked worried. Duke Shen (申公) asked one of his officials: 'Your Majesty looks worried after court. Why is that?' King Zhao replied:*

*‘It is because I deliberate on matters alone and none of my ministers can match me. That is why I am worried. There is a saying in the middle states (中蘭之言): "If a feudal lord relies on his own strength to raise an army, he becomes king; if he relies on his own strength to make friends, he becomes hegemon; if he relies on his own suspicions, he survives. But if he makes plans alone and finds no one as capable as himself, he is doomed to perish." Now, because I am not blessed with capable ministers, and none can match me, our state is close to ruin. That is why I am worried.’*

*King Zhao worries because he is alone in his wisdom, while Your Excellency (Wu Marquis) is happy because your ministers cannot match you. But actually, this is a sign of danger for your state. That is why he worries and you rejoice.’*

**Wu Marquis, deeply moved, bowed twice and said: ‘Heaven has sent you, sir, to correct my mistakes.’**

### (2) Explanation of the Moral of the Story

The moral of the story is a warning against the dangers of being too far superior in wisdom or ability to one’s subordinates. 

- **King Zhao of Chu** is deeply knowledgeable and capable, but his ministers cannot keep up with him. This isolation makes him anxious because he realizes that if he has no one to help or advise him, the state is vulnerable. He fears that if he depends only on himself, the state will eventually fall.
- **Wu Marquis of Wei**, on the other hand, is delighted that none of his ministers can match him in deliberation, seeing it as a sign of his own superiority.
- **Wu Risi points out the flaw in Wu Marquis’s thinking:** Being unmatched by one’s ministers is not a virtue but a grave danger. A wise ruler should cultivate capable ministers, not be isolated by his own brilliance. The ruler’s happiness is actually a sign of the state’s weakness.

**In essence, the story teaches that a wise leader should not be so far above his subordinates that they cannot assist or challenge him. True strength lies in having capable advisors and fostering a team that can support and complement the ruler. Relying solely on one’s own abilities leads to vulnerability and eventual downfall.**

### (3) Counterparts in Western (European) Thought

Yes, the concepts in this story have clear counterparts in Western thought, especially in political philosophy and leadership theory.

#### a) **Aristotle’s “The virtue of the statesman is to be able to use the virtues of others”**
- Aristotle, in his *Politics*, emphasizes the importance of a ruler who can select and utilize the talents of others. He warns against the “one-man rule” or the “philosopher-king” who cannot find worthy successors or capable advisors. He argues that the best government is one where the ruler is surrounded by capable citizens.

#### b) **Machiavelli’s *The Prince* — The Need for Competent Advisors**
- In *The Prince*, Machiavelli advises rulers to surround themselves with capable ministers and to avoid being isolated by their own cunning or intelligence. He warns that a prince who is too clever and cannot trust his subordinates is likely to be overthrown.

#### c) **The “Sage on the Stage vs. Guide on the Side” (Modern Leadership Theory)**
- Modern leadership theory distinguishes between leaders who dominate (the “sage on the stage”) and those who empower others (“guide on the side”). The story from 荀子 aligns with the latter: a good leader should cultivate and rely on capable subordinates.

#### d) **The Parable of the Lone Genius**
- There is a common Western parable about the lone genius who cannot share his knowledge and thus fails when he is gone. This story is similar: King Zhao’s brilliance is a liability because it isolates him.

#### e) **“No man is an island”**
- The English proverb “No man is an island” echoes the same idea: even the wisest or most capable person is vulnerable without the support of others.

---

**In summary:**  
The story from 荀子 reflects a universal principle found in both Eastern and Western thought: the importance of collective wisdom and the dangers of a leader relying solely on his own abilities. This is a theme deeply embedded in both classical and modern Western political philosophy. [end of text]
