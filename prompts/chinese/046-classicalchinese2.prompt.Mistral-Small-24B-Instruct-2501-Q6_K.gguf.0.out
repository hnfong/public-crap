 This is a passage from 荀子:

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

 1. **Translation:**

Wei Wu Hou was planning something and his plans were sound, but none of his ministers could match him. After the court session, he had a pleased expression. Wu Qi approached and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu?" Wei Wu Hou asked, "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?" Wu Qi replied, "King Zhuang of Chu planned something and his plans were sound, but none of his ministers could match him. After the court session, he had a worried expression. Shen Gong Wu Chen approached and asked, 'Your Majesty, you have a worried expression after the court session. Why is that?' King Zhuang said, 'I planned something and my plans were sound, but none of my ministers could match me. This is why I am worried. There is a saying: 'Those who have a teacher become kings, those who have a friend become hegemons, those who have doubts survive, and those who plan on their own and think no one is as good as themselves perish.' Now, with my mediocrity, if none of my ministers can match me, my country is close to perishing! This is why I am worried.' King Zhuang of Chu was worried, but you are pleased."

Wei Wu Hou hesitated, bowed twice, and said, "Heaven has sent you, Master, to correct my mistakes."

2. **Moral of the Story:**

The moral of the story is that a wise ruler should be humble and value the input of his ministers. A ruler who believes he is always right and does not consider the advice of others is likely to lead his country to ruin. The story emphasizes the importance of seeking counsel and being open to different perspectives to ensure the well-being and survival of the state.

3. **Counterpart in Western Thought:**

The concepts in this story have counterparts in Western thought, particularly in the realm of political philosophy and leadership. For example:

- **Plato's "The Republic":** Plato discusses the importance of a philosopher-king who is wise and just, but also the need for a council of advisors to ensure that decisions are made with the best interests of the state in mind.
- **Aristotle's "Politics":** Aristotle emphasizes the importance of a ruler being open to advice and the value of collective wisdom. He argues that a good ruler should be able to listen to and consider the opinions of others.
- **Niccolò Machiavelli's "The Prince":** Machiavelli advises rulers to be pragmatic and to seek the counsel of wise advisors, although he also acknowledges the need for a ruler to maintain authority and make tough decisions.

These Western philosophers, like the story from 荀子, highlight the importance of wisdom, humility, and the value of counsel in effective leadership. [end of text]
