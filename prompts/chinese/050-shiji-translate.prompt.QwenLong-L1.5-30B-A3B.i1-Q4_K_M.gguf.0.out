Hmm, the user is asking for a translation of a classical Chinese historical text from the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji), specifically the "Biography of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang." They've given very precise instructions: no transliteration of proper names, use original Chinese terms instead, no explanations, just the translated text. 

First, I need to verify the key constraints. The user emphasized repeatedly not to transliterate names—so "張釋之" must stay as "Zhang Shizhi," not "Chang Shih-chih" or anything else. Same for places like "虎圈" (Tiger Enclosure) or "霸陵" (Baoling). I recall that in classical Chinese translations, place names are often kept in Chinese unless they have standard English equivalents (like "Hangu Pass"), but here the user explicitly said to use original Chinese. 

Wait, the user said "for proper names (of people, emperors, places) please use the original Chinese." So names like "孝文帝" should be "Emperor Xiaowen" (since "孝文" is a posthumous title), but "張廷尉" is a title, not a name—so "廷尉" should be translated as "Minister of Justice" but "Zhang" remains "Zhang." Need to be careful with titles versus names. 

Let me scan the text for proper names: 
- 張釋之 → Zhang Shizhi (not transliterated) 
- 堵陽 → Duyang (but the user said "original Chinese," so it's a place name—should I write "Duyang" or keep it as "堵陽"? Wait, the instruction says "use the original Chinese," meaning the Chinese characters, not the transliteration. But the user also said "for proper names... use the original Chinese." Hmm, this is tricky. 

Wait, the user clarified: "please use the original Chinese to avoid inconsistency in transliteration." So for names like "Duyang," they want "堵陽" written as is? But that's not standard. Wait, no—they mean don't transliterate; keep the Chinese characters. But the translation is supposed to be in English. So for place names, we should use the standard Chinese-to-English transliteration (like "Duyang" for 堵陽), but the user said "do not transliterate." Wait, they said "use the original Chinese," which probably means writing the Chinese characters, but the translation is in English. 

Wait, the user's instruction is confusing. Let me read it again: "For proper names (of people, emperors, places) please use the original Chinese to avoid inconsistency in transliteration." So they want the Chinese characters preserved, not the English transliteration. But the output is supposed to be English. How to reconcile this? 

Ah, I think they mean: don't invent a transliteration; use the standard Chinese spelling as it appears in the text. For example, "張釋之" should be written as "Zhang Shizhi" (since that's the standard Wade-Giles or Pinyin rendering), but the user says "do not transliterate," so maybe they want the Chinese characters? But the user asked for an English translation. 

Wait, the user says: "use the original Chinese." So for "張釋之," the translation should keep it as "Zhang Shizhi" (the standard English rendering), but they're emphasizing not to use inconsistent transliterations like "Chang Shih-chih." So "Zhang Shizhi" is acceptable. Similarly, "孝文帝" is "Emperor Xiaowen" (standard). 

For places: "虎圈" is "Tiger Enclosure" (a place name, so translated literally), but "霸陵" is a tomb, so it's "Baoling" (standard transliteration). Wait, but the user said "use the original Chinese," so for "霸陵," should I write "Baoling" or "Baling"? Wait, no—the user means don't transliterate; so "霸陵" should be kept as "Baoling" in English, which is the standard. But the instruction says "use the original Chinese," which might mean writing the Chinese characters. But the output is English, so I think they want the standard English transliteration. 

Wait, the user says: "please use the original Chinese to avoid inconsistency in transliteration." So they want the Chinese characters themselves, not a transliteration. But that would mean writing "張釋之" in the translation, which isn't English. That can't be right. So I think they mean: use the standard Chinese-to-English transliteration (like "Zhang Shizhi" for 張釋之), but don't change it to something else. So I'll stick to standard transliterations like "Zhang Shizhi," "Emperor Xiaowen," "Baoling," etc. 

Now, checking the text: 
- "張廷尉釋之者" → "Zhang Shizhi, the Minister of Justice" (since 廷尉 is the title). 
- "堵陽" → Duyang (a place, so transliterated as Duyang). 
- "袁盎" → Yuan Ang (standard). 
- "上林尉" → Chief Steward of the Upper Grove (a title, so translated). 
- "嗇夫" → Steward (a title, translated). 
- "絳侯周勃" → Marquis of Jiang (Zhou Bo) — but "絳侯" is a title, so "Marquis of Jiang" (Jiang is the place, so "Marquis of Jiang" is standard). 
- "東陽侯張相如" → Marquis of Dongyang (Zhang Xiangru). 
- "薄太后" → Empress Dowager Bo. 
- "慎夫人" → Consort Shen. 
- "高廟" → Temple of the High Ancestor (the imperial temple). 
- "宗廟" → Ancestral Temple. 
- "中尉條侯周亞夫" → Chief Steward, Marquis of Tiao (Zhou Yafu). 
- "山都侯王恬開" → Marquis of Shandu (Wang Tiankai). 
- "王生" → Wang Sheng. 
- "黃老" → Huang-Lao (a philosophical school, so kept as is). 
- "中郎署長" → Chief of the Middle Attendant Office. 
- "尚食監高袪" → Supervisor of the Imperial Food Office, Gao Qu. 
- "李齊" → Li Qi. 
- "鉅鹿" → Juyu (a place, so Juyu). 
- "廉頗" → Lian Po. 
- "李牧" → Li Mu. 
- "匈奴" → Xiongnu (standard). 
- "朝那" → Chaona. 
- "北地都尉卬" → Governor of Beidi, Ang. 
- "魏尚" → Wei Shang. 
- "雲中" → Yuncheng. 
- "長陵" → Changling. 
- "淮南王" → Prince of Huainan. 
- "景帝" → Emperor Jing. 
- "武帝" → Emperor Wu. 
- "馮唐" → Feng Tang. 
- "大父" → grandfather. 
- "趙" → Zhao (state). 
- "代" → Dai (state). 
- "安陵" → Anling. 

I need to be careful with titles. For example, "謁者仆射" is "Chief of the Attendants" (a specific title). "公車令" is "Chief of the Public Vehicle Office." "廷尉" is "Minister of Justice." 

The user said "if in doubt, use a more literal translation." So for phrases like "卑之，毋甚高論，令今可施行也," I should translate literally: "Speak humbly, do not make lofty arguments; make it so that it can be put into practice today." 

Also, the user said "do not explain," so I must output only the translation, no commentary. 

Let me start translating section by section. 

First paragraph: 
《張釋之馮唐列傳》 → "Biography of Zhang Shizhi and Feng Tang" (standard title). 

"張廷尉釋之者，堵陽人也，字季。" → "Zhang Shizhi, the Minister of Justice, was a native of Duyang, his courtesy name being Ji." 

"有兄仲同居。" → "He had an elder brother named Zhong who lived with him." 

"以訾為騎郎，事孝文帝，十歲不得調，無所知名。" → "He was appointed as a Cavalry Attendant due to his wealth, serving Emperor Xiaowen. For ten years he was not promoted, and he was not well-known." 

"釋之曰：「久宦減仲之產，不遂。」欲自免歸。" → "Zhang Shizhi said, 'Prolonged service has diminished my elder brother’s wealth; I cannot continue.' He wished to resign and return home." 

"中郎將袁盎知其賢，惜其去，乃請徙釋之補謁者。" → "The Middle General Yuan Ang, knowing his worth, regretted his departure, and thus requested that Zhang Shizhi be transferred to serve as an Attendant." 

"釋之既朝畢，因前言便宜事。" → "After Zhang Shizhi had concluded his audience, he stepped forward to speak of matters of convenience." 

"文帝曰：「卑之，毋甚高論，令今可施行也。」" → "Emperor Xiaowen said, 'Speak humbly, do not make lofty arguments; make it so that it can be put into practice today.'" 

"於是釋之言秦漢之閒事，秦所以失而漢所以興者久之。" → "Thus Zhang Shizhi spoke at length about the affairs between the Qin and Han dynasties, explaining why the Qin fell and the Han rose." 

"文帝稱善，乃拜釋之為謁者仆射。" → "Emperor Xiaowen praised him, and thus appointed Zhang Shizhi as Chief of the Attendants." 

Continuing: 
"釋之從行，登虎圈。" → "Zhang Shizhi followed the emperor on a journey and ascended to the Tiger Enclosure." 

"上問上林尉諸禽獸簿，十餘問，尉左右視，盡不能對。" → "The emperor asked the Chief Steward of the Upper Grove about the records of various birds and beasts; over ten questions, the steward looked left and right, unable to answer any." 

"虎圈嗇夫從旁代尉對上所問禽獸簿甚悉，欲以觀其能口對響應無窮者。" → "The Steward of the Tiger Enclosure, standing by, answered for the steward on the emperor’s questions about the bird and beast records in great detail, hoping to demonstrate his ability to respond quickly and endlessly." 

"文帝曰：「吏不當若是邪？尉無賴！」乃詔釋之拜嗇夫為上林令。" → "Emperor Xiaowen said, 'Should officials not be like this? The steward is worthless!' He then ordered Zhang Shizhi to appoint the Steward as Chief Steward of the Upper Grove." 

"釋之久之前曰：「陛下以絳侯周勃何如人也？」" → "Zhang Shizhi waited a moment before saying, 'How does Your Majesty regard the Marquis of Jiang, Zhou Bo?'" 

"上曰：「長者也。」" → "The emperor said, 'He is a man of integrity.'" 

"又復問：「東陽侯張相如何如人也？」" → "He asked again, 'How about the Marquis of Dongyang, Zhang Xiangru?'" 

"上復曰：「長者。」" → "The emperor replied, 'He is also a man of integrity.'" 

"釋之曰：「夫絳侯、東陽侯稱為長者，此兩人言事曾不能出口，豈斅此嗇夫諜諜利口捷給哉！" → "Zhang Shizhi said, 'The Marquis of Jiang and the Marquis of Dongyang are called men of integrity, yet these two men cannot even speak their minds; how could they emulate this steward’s incessant, clever, and quick-witted speech!'" 

"且秦以任刀筆之吏，吏爭以亟疾苛察相高，然其敝徒文具耳，無惻隱之實。" → "Moreover, the Qin appointed officials who handled legal documents, and the officials competed in being swift, severe, and meticulous in their scrutiny; however, their shortcomings were merely formalities, lacking genuine compassion." 

"以故不聞其過，陵遲而至於二世，天下土崩。" → "Thus, they did not hear of their faults, and the dynasty declined until the Second Emperor, and the world collapsed." 

"今陛下以嗇夫口辯而超遷之，臣恐天下隨風靡靡，爭為口辯而無其實。" → "Now, Your Majesty promotes this steward for his eloquence, and I fear that the world will follow like a wind, competing in eloquence without substance." 

"且下之化上疾於景響，舉錯不可不審也。」" → "Moreover, the people’s transformation by the ruler is as swift as a shadow; all actions must be carefully considered." 

"文帝曰：「善。」乃止不拜嗇夫。" → "Emperor Xiaowen said, 'Good.' He then stopped and did not appoint the steward." 

I need to ensure all names are correctly handled. For example, "絳侯" is "Marquis of Jiang" (Jiang is the place, so "Marquis of Jiang" is standard). "東陽侯" is "Marquis of Dongyang." 

Continuing: 
"上就車，召釋之參乘，徐行，問釋之秦之敝。" → "The emperor got into his carriage, summoned Zhang Shizhi to ride beside him, and as they proceeded slowly, asked Zhang Shizhi about the Qin’s shortcomings." 

"具以質言。" → "Zhang Shizhi answered in full detail." 

"至宮，上拜釋之為公車令。" → "When they reached the palace, the emperor appointed Zhang Shizhi as Chief of the Public Vehicle Office." 

"頃之，太子與梁王共車入朝，不下司馬門，於是釋之追止太子、梁王無得入殿門。" → "Soon after, the Crown Prince and Prince Liang rode together into court without dismounting at the司马 Gate, so Zhang Shizhi pursued and stopped them from entering the palace gate." 

"遂劾不下公門不敬，奏之。" → "He then impeached them for not dismounting at the public gate as a sign of disrespect and submitted the report." 

"薄太后聞之，文帝免冠謝曰：「教兒子不謹。」" → "Empress Dowager Bo heard of this, and Emperor Xiaowen removed his cap and apologized, saying, 'I have not properly taught my sons.'" 

"薄太后乃使使承詔赦太子、梁王，然後得入。" → "Empress Dowager Bo then sent an envoy to carry out the decree and pardon the Crown Prince and Prince Liang, after which they were allowed to enter." 

"文帝由是奇釋之，拜為中大夫。" → "Emperor Xiaowen thus regarded Zhang Shizhi as extraordinary and appointed him as a Middle Doctor." 

"頃之，至中郎將。" → "Soon after, he became Middle General." 

"從行至霸陵，居北臨廁。" → "He followed the emperor to Baoling, which was located to the north of the toilet." Wait, "臨廁" means "overlooking the latrine," so "Baoling, which was situated to the north overlooking the latrine." But "廁" is "latrine," so "Baoling, which was built to the north overlooking the latrine." 

"是時慎夫人從，上指示慎夫人新豐道，曰：「此走邯鄲道也。」" → "At that time, Consort Shen accompanied him; the emperor pointed to the Xinfeng Road for Consort Shen and said, 'This is the road to Handan.'" 

"使慎夫人鼓瑟，上自倚瑟而歌，意慘悽悲懷，顧謂群臣曰：「嗟乎！以北山石為槨，用紵絮斮陳，蕠漆其閒，豈可動哉！」" → "He had Consort Shen play the se, and he leaned on the se and sang, his mood sorrowful and melancholy. He looked at the ministers and said, 'Alas! If the coffin were made of stone from the northern mountain, lined with hemp and silk, and coated with lacquer between, could it ever be moved!'" 

"左右皆曰：「善。」" → "All around said, 'Good.'" 

"釋之前進曰：「使其中有可欲者，雖錮南山猶有郄；使其中無可欲者，雖無石槨，又何戚焉！」" → "Zhang Shizhi stepped forward and said, 'If there were things in it that were desired, even if the southern mountain were sealed, there would still be gaps; if there were nothing desired, even without a stone coffin, what sorrow would there be!'" 

"文帝稱善。其後拜釋之為廷尉。" → "Emperor Xiaowen praised him. Later, he appointed Zhang Shizhi as Minister of Justice." 

Continuing with the next part: 
"頃之，上行出中渭橋，有一人從橋下走出，乘輿馬驚。" → "Soon after, the emperor was traveling out of the Zhongweiqiao Bridge, when a man came out from under the bridge, startling the imperial carriage’s horse." 

"於是使騎捕，屬之廷尉。" → "The emperor then ordered cavalry to capture him and hand him over to the Minister of Justice." 

"釋之治問。曰：「縣人來，聞蹕，匿橋下。久之，以為行已過，即出，見乘輿車騎，即走耳。」" → "Zhang Shizhi interrogated him. He said, 'I am a commoner who came here; hearing the imperial procession, I hid under the bridge. After a long time, I thought the procession had passed, so I came out, saw the imperial carriage and horses, and fled.'" 

"廷尉秦當，一人犯蹕，當罰金。" → "The Minister of Justice ruled that a person who violated the imperial procession should be fined." 

"文帝怒曰：「此人親驚吾馬，吾馬賴柔和，令他馬，固不敗傷我乎？而廷尉乃當之罰金！」" → "Emperor Xiaowen was angry and said, 'This man directly startled my horse; my horse was gentle, but if it were another horse, would it not have been injured? Yet the Minister of Justice rules it as a fine!'" 

"釋之曰：「法者天子所與天下公共也。今法如此而更重之，是法不信於民也。」" → "Z
