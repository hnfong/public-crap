### (1) Translation

Lord Wu of Wei had deliberated on a matter and reached a correct decision; none of his ministers could surpass him. Upon returning from court, he wore a look of joy. Wu Qi approached and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu mentioned to your attendants?"

Lord Wu asked, "What were the words of King Zhuang of Chu?"

Wu Qi replied, "When King Zhuang of Chu deliberated on a matter and reached a correct decision, and none of his ministers could surpass him, he returned from court with a look of sorrow. Shen Gong Wu Chen approached and asked, 'Your Majesty, why do you wear a look of sorrow after court?'

King Zhuang said, 'I have deliberated on a matter and reached a correct decision, and none of my ministers can surpass me; this is why I am sorrowful. There is a saying in the *Zhong Lun* (The Middle Discourses): "A feudal lord who finds a teacher among his subjects will become a King (Wang); one who finds a friend will become a Hegemon (Ba); one who finds a doubter (someone who can challenge him) will survive; but one who relies solely on his own planning and finds no one equal to or better than himself will perish." Now, with my unworthiness, none of my ministers can surpass me. Is my state not on the verge of perishing? This is why I am sorrowful.'"

King Zhuang of Chu was sorrowful, yet you, my Lord, are joyful."

Lord Wu stepped back, bowed twice, and said, "Heaven has sent you, Master, to correct my faults."

### (2) The Moral of the Story

The central moral of this passage is the **danger of intellectual isolation and the necessity of critical counsel for a ruler**.

*   **Humility vs. Arrogance:** The story contrasts two reactions to the same situation (a ruler outsmarting his ministers). Lord Wu's joy reveals arrogance and a lack of self-awareness, while King Zhuang's sorrow reveals profound wisdom and humility.
*   **The Value of Dissent:** The text argues that a ruler's survival depends on having subjects who can challenge, correct, or surpass him. If a ruler is the smartest person in the room, it implies the room is filled with incompetent people, which is a recipe for national collapse.
*   **The Hierarchy of Counsel:** The quote from the *Zhong Lun* outlines a hierarchy of relationships between a ruler and his subjects:
    1.  **Teacher (Shi):** The ideal. The subject is wiser than the ruler, guiding him to supreme virtue (Wang).
    2.  **Friend (You):** The subject is an equal, leading to hegemony (Ba).
    3.  **Doubter/Challenger (Yi):** The subject can question the ruler, ensuring the state survives.
    4.  **No One:** If the ruler is unmatched, the state is doomed to perish.

Ultimately, the story teaches that true leadership is not about being the smartest person, but about cultivating an environment where others can be smarter than you.

### (3) Counterparts in Western (European) Thought

Yes, the concepts in this story have strong counterparts in Western political philosophy, particularly regarding the **burden of leadership**, the **value of dissent**, and the **dangers of flattery**.

**1. The "Court of Flatterers" and the Need for Truth-Tellers**
*   **Plato's *Republic*:** Plato discusses the danger of the "tyrant" who is surrounded by flatterers and hears only what he wants to hear. He argues that a just ruler must be guided by philosopher-kings (teachers) who possess wisdom superior to the ruler's own.
*   **Machiavelli's *The Prince*:** While often associated with cunning, Machiavelli explicitly advises princes on how to choose counselors. He warns that a prince who listens only to those who tell him what he wants to hear will be ruined. He writes: *"A prince should always seek to know the truth... and he should encourage his subjects to speak the truth to him freely."* This mirrors King Zhuang's desire for a "doubter" rather than a sycophant.

**2. The Socratic Method and Intellectual Humility**
*   **Socrates:** The core of Socratic philosophy is the admission of ignorance ("I know that I know nothing"). A ruler who believes he knows everything (like Lord Wu initially) is the antithesis of the Socratic ideal. The story aligns with the Western view that wisdom begins with the recognition of one's own limitations.

**3. The "King's Two Bodies" and the Danger of Solipsism**
*   **Montesquieu and the Enlightenment:** In *The Spirit of Laws*, Montesquieu argues against absolute power where the ruler is unchecked. The idea that a ruler needs "doubters" to survive is a precursor to the Western concept of **checks and balances**. If the executive branch (the ruler) has no one to challenge its decisions, the system becomes fragile and prone to error.

**4. Biblical Parallels**
*   **King Solomon and King Rehoboam:** In the Bible (1 Kings 12), King Rehoboam rejects the advice of the elders (who offered a moderate path) and listens to his young peers who told him to be harsher. This led to the division of the kingdom. Conversely, King Solomon is praised for his wisdom, which was often sought through counsel. The narrative arc of "listening to the wise vs. listening to the flatterers" is a recurring theme in Judeo-Christian political thought.

**Summary of Comparison:**
While the Chinese text uses the specific framework of *Wang* (King) and *Ba* (Hegemon) and emphasizes the moral character of the ruler, the Western counterparts focus heavily on **institutional checks**, **the psychology of power**, and the **epistemological danger** of a leader who believes they possess all the answers. Both traditions agree: **A leader who cannot be challenged is a leader who is already failing.** [end of text]
