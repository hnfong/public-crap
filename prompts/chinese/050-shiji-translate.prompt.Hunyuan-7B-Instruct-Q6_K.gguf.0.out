**"Biography of Zhang Shi Zhi"**  
Zhang Tingwei, courtesy name Ji, was a man from Douyang. He had a brother named Zhong and lived together. He was appointed as a騎郎 (sailor) and served under Emperor Xiawen. At the age of ten, he was not promoted, and his name was unknown. Zhang Shi Zhi said, "I have served in the imperial court for a long time, reducing my brother Zhong's wealth, and I have not achieved success." He wanted to resign and return to his hometown. However, the Vice Commander of the Central Army, Yuan Ang, recognized his wisdom and regretted his departure. He then requested Zhang Shi Zhi to serve as a謁者 (court clerk). After completing his morning duties, Zhang Shi Zhi mentioned his favor for a minor task. Emperor Xiawen said, "Do not speak of such trivial matters. Let us decide whether to proceed now." As a result, Zhang Shi Zhi's remarks about the trivial affairs of the Qin and Han dynasties influenced the decline of Qin and the rise of Han over time. The emperor praised his advice and appointed Zhang Shi Zhi as a謁者仆射 (court clerk).  

Zhang Shi Zhi followed the emperor to the Tiger Circle. The emperor asked the Director of the Upper Forest about the records of animals and birds, asking over ten questions. The emperor's attendants looked around and could not answer. The tiger circle clerk, who stood by the side, answered the questions very well. He wanted to test Zhang Shi Zhi's ability to respond verbally. Emperor Xiawen said, "Is it so improper for a clerk to behave like this? The clerk has no authority!" The emperor then appointed the tiger circle clerk as the Director of the Upper Forest and Zhang Shi Zhi as a court clerk. Before leaving, Zhang Shi Zhi said, "How does Your Majesty view Lord Zhou Bo, the Marquis of the Red Ribbon?" The emperor replied, "He is a great leader." The emperor then asked, "How do you view Marquis Zhang of the Eastern Yang?" The emperor again replied, "He is a great leader." Zhang Shi Zhi said, "The Marquis of the Red Ribbon and Marquis Zhang of the Eastern Yang are both called great leaders, yet these two men could not even speak well. Why should we favor the smooth-talking tiger circle clerk over them? Moreover, Qin relied on clerks skilled in writing and record-keeping. These clerks competed fiercely to be quick to judge and harsh in their criticism, yet they were merely idle officials with no concern for truth. As a result, their mistakes were not noticed, and by the time Emperor Er arrived, the empire was in chaos. Now, Your Majesty uses the tiger circle clerk's smooth words to promote him. I fear that the world will follow suit, and people will compete in empty words without substance. Moreover, the lower ranks are more affected by such rhetoric than the upper ranks, and mistakes must be carefully scrutinized." The emperor said, "Well said." He then stopped appointing the tiger circle clerk.  

The emperor rode in a chariot and summoned Zhang Shi Zhi to accompany him. They traveled slowly, and the emperor asked Zhang Shi Zhi about the failures of Qin. He spoke frankly. Upon arriving at the palace, the emperor appointed Zhang Shi Zhi as the commander of the imperial chariot.  

At that time, the Crown Prince and Prince Liang rode in a chariot to the palace without dismounting at the Ma Gate. Zhang Shi Zhi chased them but could not get them into the palace. He then accused them of not showing respect at the imperial gate and submitted a report. Upon hearing this, Empress Dowager Bo, upon learning of the matter, had the emperor remove his hat and apologized, saying, "I taught my children to be improper." Empress Dowager Bo then sent emissaries to pardon the Crown Prince and Prince Liang, and they were allowed to enter. The emperor was thus surprised by Zhang Shi Zhi and appointed him as a Vice Minister.  

Later, the emperor summoned Zhang Shi Zhi to the Central Army. He accompanied the emperor to Baoling, where he stayed by the north gate. At that time, Lady Shen accompanied him. The emperor instructed Lady Shen to take the new Feng Road, saying, "This is the way to Handan." Lady Shen played the zither, and the emperor leaned on it to sing, expressing sorrow and grief. He then said to his ministers, "Alas! If we use stones from the northern mountains as oaks and cut them with silk, and coat them with漆 (paint), will they move?" His attendants said, "Well said." Before leaving, Zhang Shi Zhi said, "If there are those who wish to take them, even if they are buried deep in the southern mountains, they will still find their way; if there are those who do not wish to take them, even if there are no stones or oaks, why should they be concerned?" The emperor praised him. Later, he appointed Zhang Shi Zhi as the Director of the Central Army.  

At that time, the emperor crossed the Central Wei Bridge and someone emerged from under the bridge, startling a horse. The emperor sent a rider to catch him, who was then appointed as the Director of the Central Army. The Director of the Central Army, Zhang Shi Zhi, questioned him. He said, "A county man came and heard about his tracks, hiding under the bridge. After some time, he thought he had passed and emerged, only to see a man on a cart with a horse, and he ran away." The Director of the Central Army, Zhang Shi Zhi, sentenced the man to a fine. The emperor was angry and said, "This man startled my horse. My horse is gentle, so why did his horse get hurt? And the Director of the Central Army sentenced him to a fine!" Zhang Shi Zhi said, "Law is something the emperor shares with the world. If the law is applied like this and then made stricter, it shows that the law does not trust the people. Moreover, at that time, if the emperor had ordered the execution, it would have been done. Now that the Director of the Central Army has been removed, the world is at peace. But now, with one side falling, the law is applied differently—some are given leniency, others are punished harshly. The people are at a loss. Only Your Majesty can decide." After some time, the emperor said, "The Director of the Central Army is right."  

Later, someone stole the imperial palace's jade ring and sat in front of it, and it was captured. The emperor was furious and sent Zhang Shi Zhi to investigate. Zhang Shi Zhi presented a report on the theft of the imperial palace's ceremonial items and was sentenced to exile.
