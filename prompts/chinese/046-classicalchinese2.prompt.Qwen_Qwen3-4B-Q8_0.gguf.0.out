Certainly! Here's your requested analysis of the passage from *Xunzi*:

---

### (1) **English Translation of the Story:**

Wang Wu侯 (Feng Wu Hou) was planning a matter and made the right decision, and none of his ministers could match his ability. After the meeting, he showed a happy face. Wu Qi (Wu Qi) approached and said: "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu spoken to the court officials?" Wu Hou asked, "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?"

Wu Qi replied: "King Zhuang of Chu was also planning a matter and made the right decision, but none of his ministers could match him. After the meeting, he showed a worried expression. When Shen Gong Wu Chen (Shen Gong, a minister) asked him, 'Why are you worried?' King Zhuang said, 'I have made the right decision in my planning, and none of my ministers could match me. Therefore, I am worried. The saying of Zhong Rui (a wise person) says: "A ruler who gets a teacher will become a king; one who gets a friend will become a hegemon; one who gets a doubt will survive. But a ruler who plans alone and finds no one to match him will fall." Now, because I am not a worthy ruler and my ministers cannot match me, our country is nearly doomed. Therefore, I am worried.'"

King Wu Hou, feeling ashamed, bowed twice and said: "The heavens have sent you, Master Wu Qi, to correct my mistakes."

### (2) **Moral of the Story:**

The moral of the story is a **caution against pride and overconfidence**. King Feng Wu Hou was happy after making a correct decision, but Wu Qi pointed out that a wise ruler would be **worried** rather than happy, because the ruler's success is not a sign of personal ability, but a sign that he may be **too confident** and **not humble enough**. The story emphasizes the importance of **humility**, **self-awareness**, and the **value of others' opinions**. It also reflects the idea that **a ruler should not be complacent** in his own abilities, but should remain open to criticism and the wisdom of others.

### (3) **Counterparts in Western (European) Thought:**

Yes, the concepts in this story have counterparts in Western philosophy and thought:

- **Humility and Self-Awareness**: This is a key theme in many Western philosophical traditions, especially in **Stoicism** (e.g., Marcus Aurelius, Seneca), which emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and the dangers of overconfidence. The Stoics often warn against pride and the illusion of one's own wisdom.

- **The Value of Others' Wisdom**: This is similar to the idea of **"the wisdom of the crowd"** or the **"rule of law"**, where the strength of a society comes from the collective wisdom of its members, not just the individual leader.

- **The Danger of Overconfidence**: This is also a theme in **Aristotle’s** *Nicomachean Ethics*, where he discusses the dangers of hubris (excessive pride) and the importance of moderation.

- **The Role of a Teacher or Mentor**: The idea that a ruler should seek a teacher or a wise advisor is similar to the Western concept of **"mentorship"** and the importance of **guidance from others**.

- **The Concept of "Wisdom of the Crowd"**: In modern political and social theory, the idea that a ruler should not rely solely on his own judgment but should be open to the opinions of others is echoed in the **"wisdom of the crowd"** theory, which suggests that the collective judgment of a group is often more accurate than that of an individual.

### Summary:

The story from *Xunzi* is a powerful reminder of the dangers of **pride and overconfidence**, and the importance of **humility, self-awareness, and the value of others' opinions**. These ideas are deeply rooted in both Chinese and Western philosophical traditions, showing that the wisdom of the ancients is not unique to any one culture. [end of text]
