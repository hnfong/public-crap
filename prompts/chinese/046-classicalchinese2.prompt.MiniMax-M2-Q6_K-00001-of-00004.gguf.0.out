### 1. English translation

When Duke Wu of Wei was deliberating on affairs and made a decision that was correct, none of his ministers could match him. After the court session, he showed a pleased expression. Wu Qi stepped forward and said: “Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu from those around you?” Duke Wu asked: “What did King Zhuang of Chu say?” Wu Qi replied: “King Zhuang of Chu deliberated on affairs and made a decision that was correct; none of his ministers could match him. After the court session, he showed a worried expression. Shen Gong Wuchen stepped forward and asked: ‘Your Majesty, why do you look worried after the court session?’ The king said: ‘I deliberated on affairs and made a decision that was correct, yet none of my ministers can match me—that is why I am worried. In the words of the “Zhongfu” (the “Inner Minister” or “Minister of the Interior”), it is said: “A ruler who obtains a teacher becomes a king; one who obtains a friend becomes a hegemon; one who obtains a challenger survives; one who thinks for himself and has no one better than himself perishes.” Now, with my unworthiness, none of my ministers can match me—will my state not be near ruin? That is why I am worried.’ King Zhuang of Chu was worried, yet you, my lord, are pleased.” Duke Wu of Wei, hesitating, bowed twice and said: “Heaven has sent you, Master, to awaken me to my faults.”

### 2. Moral of the story

The story contrasts two rulers’ reactions to the same situation—having made a correct decision while none of their ministers can match them. King Zhuang of Chu is worried because he sees this as a sign that his state lacks capable ministers and that he is isolated in wisdom, which he interprets as a danger to the state. Duke Wu of Wei, by contrast, is pleased, missing the warning signal. Wu Qi uses the example to teach Duke Wu that a ruler should be alarmed when he stands alone in wisdom; true strength lies in having ministers who can match or surpass him, and in heeding counsel. The moral is that a ruler should cultivate capable ministers, welcome criticism, and be wary of complacency and isolation.

### 3. Western counterparts

Yes, the ideas have clear counterparts in Western thought:

- **Plato’s “Apology” and “Republic”**: Socrates famously warned that the unexamined life is not worth living and that the wise know they do not know. The ruler who thinks he is wise while surrounded by inferiors is like the tyrant in the “Republic” who becomes isolated and dangerous. The emphasis on self-examination and the danger of unchecked power resonates with the story.

- **Machiavelli’s “The Prince”**: Machiavelli advises rulers to avoid being despised and to be feared rather than hated, but he also stresses the importance of wise counsel and the dangers of isolation. The idea that a ruler should be wary when he has no equals who can challenge him is present in Machiavelli’s warnings about the isolation of power.

- **The Biblical tradition**: Proverbs 27:17 (“As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another”) and Ecclesiastes 4:12 (“A cord of three strands is not quickly broken”) emphasize the value of mutual challenge and counsel. The story’s warning against ruler isolation and the need for capable ministers aligns with these proverbs.

- **Classical republicanism**: Thinkers like Cicero and later the American Founders emphasized the importance of checks and balances and the danger of concentrating power without counsel. The idea that a ruler should be alarmed when he stands alone in wisdom is echoed in concerns about tyranny and the need for a diversity of counsel.

In sum, the story’s core teaching—that a ruler should be wary of isolation and value capable ministers who can challenge him—has deep parallels in Western philosophical, political, and religious traditions. [end of text]
