- **From a legalistic perspective**, his actions were justified as he **exposed and punished corrupt officials** who were exploiting the people.  
- **From a deontological perspective**, some might argue that **using deception** (pretending to support the ritual) was morally questionable, as it involved lying.  
- **From a cultural perspective**, in the context of ancient China, his actions were seen as **just and courageous**, as he upheld justice and public good.  
- **From a modern human rights perspective**, the practice of sacrificing girls was **clearly immoral**, and Ximen Bao’s intervention was a necessary and moral act to stop it.

**Q6: At the end of 滑稽列传, it is said that: "傳曰：「子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。」三子之才能誰最賢哉？辨治者當能別之。" -- explain what it means, and whether the comment is fair. (15 points)**  

This quote compares the governance styles of three famous officials:  
- **Zi Chan (子產)** governed Zheng, and the people **could not deceive** him — implying he was wise and perceptive.  
- **Zi Jian (子賤)** governed Danfu, and the people **did not dare to deceive** him — implying he was respected and beloved.  
- **Ximen Bao** governed Ye, and the people **dared not deceive** him — implying he was feared and strict.

The question asks **who among the three was the most virtuous or capable**, and suggests that a wise judge of governance should be able to distinguish between them.

**Is the comment fair?**  
- **Yes**, in a way, because it highlights **different aspects of good governance**: wisdom (Zi Chan), benevolence (Zi Jian), and authority (Ximen Bao).  
- **However**, it may be **somewhat biased** toward Ximen Bao, as his method involved **force and deception**, which could be seen as harsh.  
- **Zi Chan and Zi Jian** are often praised in Confucian texts for their **gentler, more ethical leadership**, which aligns more closely with Confucian ideals.  
- **Ximen Bao**, while effective, used **unconventional and possibly brutal methods**, which may not be seen as the most "virtuous" by Confucian standards.

In conclusion, the comment is **fair in acknowledging different styles of governance**, but it may **overemphasize fear and effectiveness** over moral virtue. [end of text]
