Alright, I need to explain the origin of the given modern creation that imitates ancient poetry with a touch of humor. The phrase provided is:

“多情自古空餘恨，此恨綿綿無絕期”

This seems to be a modern adaptation of an ancient poem, incorporating a playful or teasing element. The original line appears to be a mix of classical Chinese poetry and modern colloquial language, possibly blending traditional themes with contemporary humor.

First, I should identify the source of the original line. The first part, “多情自古空餘恨”，translates to “Since ancient times, those with deep affection are left with only regret.” This sounds like a line from a famous ancient poem, possibly from the Tang Dynasty, where emotions and love were often themes.

The second part, “此恨綿綿無絕期”，means “This regret is endless and never ends.” This also echoes the melancholic tone typical of classical poetry.

Now, considering the modern twist, it seems the author has taken a serious line from ancient poetry and added a humorous or ironic element, making it more relatable or amusing to a contemporary audience.

To create similar sentences, I should aim to blend classical poetic elements with modern language, perhaps introducing a humorous twist or a contemporary reference. Drawing inspiration from genuine ancient poems will help maintain the classical flair while infusing new life into the lines.

For example, taking a famous line like “身無彩鳳雙飛翼” from Li Shangyin’s poem, which translates to “I have no colorful phoenix wings to fly,” and adding a modern touch could result in something like “身無彩鳳雙飛翼，卻有手機隨時在手。” This maintains the classical structure while incorporating a modern device.

Another example could be using a line from Du Fu’s poetry, such as “無邊落木蕭蕭下”，which means “Endless falling leaves rustle down,” and adding a humorous element like “無邊落木蕭蕭下，卻是秋風吹不散的思念。” This keeps the classical essence while introducing a contemporary emotion.

In summary, the key is to balance the classical structure and language with modern elements, ensuring that the new lines retain the elegance and depth of ancient poetry while adding a fresh, humorous perspective.
