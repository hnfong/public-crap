### (1) Translation of the Story  
King Wu of Wei was discussing matters and was always right, but his ministers could not match him. After returning from court, he would smile. When Wu Qi entered, he asked, "Have you heard the words of King Chuang of Chu from those around you?" The king asked, "What did King Chuang say?" Wu Qi replied, "King Chuang once said, 'When I make decisions, I am always right, but my ministers cannot match me. When I return from court, I am worried. When my minister, Shen Gong, asked, 'Why are you worried, Your Majesty?' I said, 'I am worried because I am the one who makes decisions, and my ministers cannot match me. The words of the minister, Shen Gong, were: 'If a state is led by a wise leader, it becomes a kingdom; if led by a friendly leader, it becomes a hegemon; if led by a suspicious leader, it survives. But if a leader makes decisions alone and no one can match him, the state will perish.' Now, because I am not wise, and my ministers cannot match me, my state is nearly lost. That is why I am worried.' King Chuang was worried, but the king was happy." The king bowed and said, "Wu Qi has corrected my mistake."

### (2) Moral of the Story  
The story teaches that **humility and self-awareness are essential for effective leadership**. King Wu of Wei, despite his confidence, failed to recognize his own shortcomings, leading to a dangerous overconfidence. In contrast, King Chuang of Chu acknowledged his limitations and sought wisdom from his ministers, which ultimately saved his state. The moral emphasizes that **true leadership requires listening to others, recognizing one’s flaws, and avoiding the hubris of believing oneself infallible**.

### (3) Western Counterpart in Thought  
Yes, the story aligns with several Western philosophical ideas:  
- **Socratic Humility**: Socrates’ famous dictum, "I know that I know nothing," reflects the importance of self-awareness and the recognition of one’s ignorance.  
- **Aristotelian Virtue Ethics**: Aristotle’s emphasis on *phronesis* (practical wisdom) and the balance between confidence and humility in leadership mirrors the story’s lesson.  
- **Plato’s "Allegory of the Cave"**: The idea that leaders must seek truth beyond their own perceptions (like King Chuang’s reliance on Shen Gong’s advice) parallels the Western emphasis on critical inquiry and intellectual humility.  
- **Modern Leadership Theories**: Concepts like "servant leadership" (e.g., Greenleaf’s work) and the dangers of "hubris" in leadership (e.g., in political science) resonate with the story’s message.  

The story’s core idea—that **leadership requires humility and the willingness to learn from others**—is a universal principle found in both Eastern and Western traditions. [end of text]
