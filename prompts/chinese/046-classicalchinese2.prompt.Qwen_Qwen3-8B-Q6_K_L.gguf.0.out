### (1) **Translation into English:**

**The Story from *Xunzi*:**

King Wu of Wei planned a matter and got it right, and no minister could match him. After court, he was happy and showed a joyful expression. Wu Qi approached and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Chu Zhuang of Chu, spoken to those around him?" King Wu asked, "What did King Chu Zhuang say?" Wu Qi replied, "When King Chu Zhuang planned a matter and got it right, and no minister could match him, he would show a worried expression. Shen Gong Wu Chen approached and asked, 'Your Majesty, why are you worried?' King Chu Zhuang said, 'I planned a matter and got it right, and no minister could match me. That is why I am worried. There is a saying from Zhong Lai: "A ruler who has a teacher among the feudal lords will become king; a ruler who has a friend among the feudal lords will become hegemon; a ruler who has a doubtful mind will survive; but a ruler who relies only on himself and finds no one better than himself will perish." Now, because I am not virtuous, and no minister can match me, our country is almost doomed to destruction. That is why I am worried.' King Chu Zhuang was worried, but you are happy. King Wu of Wei hesitated and bowed twice, saying, 'Heaven has sent you, Master, to correct my mistake.'"
