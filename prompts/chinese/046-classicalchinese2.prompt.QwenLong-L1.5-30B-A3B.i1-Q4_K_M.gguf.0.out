<think>
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user provided a passage from Xunzi, which is a classical Chinese text. They want three things: a translation, an explanation of the moral, and a comparison to Western thought.

First, I need to translate the passage into English. The user mentioned keeping proper names in Chinese, so I should make sure not to translate names like 魏武侯, 吳起, 楚莊王, etc. Let me read through the passage again to understand the context.

The story is about Wei Wuhou (魏武侯) who is happy after a successful meeting because his ministers couldn't match his decisions. Then Wu Qi (吳起) brings up a story about King Zhuang of Chu (楚莊王), who was worried after a similar situation. The key point is that Chu Zhuang Wang was concerned because his ministers couldn't match his decisions, fearing that he was being too self-reliant, which could lead to the state's downfall. The moral here is about humility and the danger of overconfidence.

Wait, let me check the translation. The user provided the Chinese text, so I need to make sure the translation is accurate. Let me parse each part. "魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。" So Wei Wuhou's plans were successful, no minister could match him, so he had a happy expression after the meeting. Then Wu Qi asks if he's heard of Chu Zhuang Wang's words. Chu Zhuang Wang, after a successful meeting, had a worried expression. His minister申公巫臣 (Shen Gong Wuchen) asked why, and Chu Zhuang Wang quoted a saying: "Rulers who find teachers become kings, find friends become hegemon, find doubters survive, and those who think they're the best alone will perish." So he's worried because his ministers can't match him, meaning he's the one who's the best, so he's heading towards灭亡 (perishing). Then Wei Wuhou realizes his mistake and thanks Wu Qi.

Okay, so the translation needs to be accurate. Let me make sure the terms are right. "中蘬之言" – "zhong hui" might be a typo? Wait, the original says "其在中蘬之言也", maybe "中蘬" is a place or a title. Wait, in Chinese, "中蘬" might be a mistranslation or typo. Wait, looking at the original text: "其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」" Hmm, "中蘬" – maybe it's "中虺" or "中虺" is a person? Wait, maybe it's a typo for "中虺" (zhong hui), but I'm not sure. Wait, in some versions of the text, it's "中虺" but here it's written as "中蘬". Wait, maybe it's a typo. Let me check. Wait, the user wrote "中蘬", but in standard Chinese, maybe it's supposed to be "中虺". Wait, but I should stick to the text provided. Maybe it's a variant. Alternatively, "中蘬" might be a mistranscription. Wait, but the user provided the text as is, so I should keep it as "Zhonghui" or "Zhonghui's words"? Wait, the phrase is "其在中蘬之言也", so "the words of Zhonghui". Wait, but "中蘬" – maybe it's a name. Let me check. Wait, in the Chu Zhuang Wang story, the person who speaks is probably a minister. The original says "申公巫臣進問曰", so Shen Gong Wuchen is the minister. Then Chu Zhuang Wang quotes "中蘬之言", so "Zhonghui's words". Wait, but "中蘬" might be a typo. Wait, in some sources, it's "中虺" (Zhonghui), which is a person's name. So maybe it's a typo in the user's text. But since the user provided "中蘬", I should keep it as is, but maybe note that it's a possible typo. Wait, but the user says "keep the proper names in Chinese", so I should write "Zhonghui" even if it's a typo. Wait, but "中蘬" is written as two characters. Let me check the standard version. Wait, I recall that in the Xunzi text, the quote is from "Zhonghui" (中虺), so maybe the user made a typo. But since the user provided "中蘬", I should use that. Wait, but "蘬" is a different character. Let me confirm. The character for "hui" in Chinese is 虺, which is a type of snake. "蘬" is a different character, maybe a typo. So probably it's a typo for 中虺. So in the translation, I should write "Zhonghui's words" but note that it's likely a typo. Wait, but the user says to keep proper names in Chinese, so maybe I should write "Zhonghui" as per the text, even if it's a typo. Wait, but the user's text says "中蘬", so I should transliterate that. Wait, "中蘬" would be "Zhonghui" if it's a typo, but the actual character is 虺. Hmm. Maybe the user made a typo, but I should follow the text given. So I'll write "Zhonghui" as per the text, but maybe in the translation, use "Zhonghui" and note the possible typo. Wait, but the user didn't ask for notes, just the translation. So I'll transliterate "中蘬" as "Zhonghui" since that's the standard way to handle such names. Wait, but "中蘬" is two characters: 中 and 蘬. The pronunciation of 蘬 is "guī" or "kuí"? Wait, maybe it's a typo for 虺, which is "huǐ". So "Zhonghui" would be the transliteration. So I'll go with "Zhonghui" in the translation.

Okay, moving on. The translation should be accurate. Let me draft it.

"King Wu of Wei planned something well, and none of his ministers could match him. After the meeting, he had a happy expression. Wu Qi approached and said, 'Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu?' King Wu of Wei replied, 'What were King Zhuang of Chu's words?' Wu Qi answered, 'King Zhuang of Chu planned something well, and none of his ministers could match him. After the meeting, he had a worried expression. Shen Gong Wuchen approached and asked, "Why do you have a worried expression after the meeting?" King Zhuang said, "I am not worthy, yet none of my ministers can match me. Therefore, I am worried. The words of Zhonghui say, 'A ruler who finds a teacher becomes a king, finds a friend becomes a hegemon, finds a doubter survives, and one who plans alone and thinks no one is equal to himself will perish.' Now, because of my unworthiness, none of my ministers can match me, so our state is nearly perished. That is why I am worried." King Wu of Wei, after hearing this, hesitated and bowed twice, saying, 'Heaven has sent you to correct my mistakes.'"

Wait, let me check the original again. "楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。" So "Chu Zhuang Wang was忧 (worried), but you (the king) are喜 (happy)." So the translation should reflect that contrast.

Wait, the user's text says: "楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。" So "Chu Zhuang Wang was worried, but you are happy." So in the translation, I should make that contrast clear.

Also, "天使夫子振寡人之過也。" "Heaven has sent you, sir, to correct my mistakes." So "Heaven has sent you to correct my mistakes."

Wait, "振" here means to correct or to rectify. So "振寡人之過" is "correct my mistakes."

Okay, so the translation should be accurate. Let me check the key phrases.

"諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。" So "Rulers who find teachers become kings, find friends become hegemon, find doubters survive, and those who plan alone and think no one is like themselves will perish."

Wait, "莫己若者" means "no one is like themselves," so "those who think no one is as good as themselves."

So the translation should be: "A ruler who finds a teacher becomes a king, finds a friend becomes a hegemon, finds doubters survives, and one who plans alone and thinks no one is equal to himself will perish."

Wait, "得疑者存" – "find doubters survives." So "doubters" here refers to people who question or doubt, so ministers who are willing to challenge the ruler's decisions. So "those who have ministers who doubt them survive."

Okay, so the moral is that a ruler should be humble, seek out advisors who can challenge them, and not become overconfident because thinking you're the best leads to downfall.

Now, part (2) is explaining the moral. So the main point is that overconfidence and lack of humility in leadership can lead to disaster, whereas being open to criticism and having capable advisors is crucial for a ruler's success.

Part (3) is whether there's a counterpart in Western thought. Hmm. Let's think. The idea of a ruler needing advisors who can challenge them, the danger of self-aggrandizement. In Western philosophy, there's the concept of the "wise king" who listens to advisors. For example, in Plato's Republic, the philosopher-king is supposed to be wise, but also to have advisors. Wait, but maybe more directly, the idea of the "court fool" in medieval Europe, who was allowed to speak truth to power. Or the concept of "counsel" in medieval governance, where kings were advised by councils. But the specific quote about "those who think no one is like themselves will perish" reminds me of the Greek concept of hubris. Hubris is excessive pride or arrogance, which leads to downfall, as in Greek tragedies. For example, in the story of King Lear, his hubris leads to his downfall. Also, in the Bible, Proverbs 16:18 says, "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall." So that's a Western counterpart. Also, in Machiavelli's The Prince, he talks about the importance of having wise advisors and not being too self-reliant. So Machiavelli advises rulers to listen to their ministers and not to be arrogant. So the concept of hubris in Greek thought and the biblical warning against pride are counterparts.

Wait, but the specific quote from Chu Zhuang Wang is about having ministers who can challenge you. So the idea that a ruler should have people who can question their decisions. In Western thought, the concept of "counsel" is important. For example, in the English tradition, the idea of the king consulting with his council, like the Magna Carta requiring the king to consult with barons. Also, in Roman times, the Senate advised the Emperor. But the specific moral here is about the danger of thinking you're the best, which is hubris. So the counterpart would be the Greek concept of hubris leading to nemesis (retribution). So the story's moral aligns with the Greek idea of hubris.

Wait, but the user is asking for a counterpart in Western (European) thought. So I should mention hubris in Greek tragedy, maybe the story of Icarus, or the myth of Phaethon, where excessive pride leads to downfall. Also, the biblical proverb. So the answer would be yes, with examples from Greek tragedy and biblical wisdom.

Wait, but let me confirm. The key point in the story is that the ruler is worried because his ministers can't match him, which means he's not getting good advice, so he's overconfident. The moral is that a ruler should be humble and seek out advisors who can challenge them, otherwise, they'll fall. So the Western counterpart would be the concept of hubris, which is a major theme in Greek literature, where excessive pride leads to downfall. For example, in Sophocles' Oedipus Rex, Oedipus's hubris leads to his tragic fall. Similarly, in the story of King Agamemnon, his hubris leads to his death. So the idea that pride leads to ruin is a common theme in Western thought.

Also, in the context of governance, the idea that a ruler should listen to advisors is present in works like Machiavelli's The Prince, where he advises rulers to have a council of advisors and not to be too self-reliant. So Machiavelli's advice aligns with the moral of the story.

Wait, but the specific quote from Chu Zhuang Wang is about "those who think no one is like themselves will perish," which is directly about self-aggrandizement. So the Western counterpart would be the concept of hubris. So the answer to part (3) is yes, with examples from Greek tragedy (hubris) and possibly biblical wisdom (Proverbs 16:18).

Let me make sure I'm not missing anything. The story is from Xunzi, which is a Confucian text, emphasizing the importance of humility and the role of advisors. So the moral is about humility in leadership, avoiding arrogance, and the necessity of having capable advisors who can challenge the ruler's decisions.

So for part (2), the moral is that a leader should remain humble, recognize their own limitations, and seek out advisors who can provide critical feedback, as overconfidence and self-reliance can lead to the downfall of the state.

For part (3), the counterpart in Western thought is the concept of hubris in Greek tragedy, where excessive pride leads to ruin, and also the biblical warning against pride (Proverbs 16:18), as well as Machiavelli's advice in The Prince about the importance of having wise counselors.

Wait, but the user specified "Western (European) thought," so Greek and Roman, then medieval and Renaissance. So Greek tragedy is definitely Western European thought. So that's a solid counterpart.

Now, let me check if the translation is accurate. Let me go through the original Chinese again.

魏武侯謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，退朝而有喜色。吳起進曰：「亦嘗有以楚莊王之語，聞於左右者乎？」武侯曰：「楚莊王之語何如？」吳起對曰：「楚莊王謀事而當，群臣莫逮，退朝而有憂色。申公巫臣進問曰：『王朝而有憂色，何也？』莊王曰：『不穀謀事而當，群臣莫能逮，是以憂也。其在中蘬之言也，曰：「諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。」今以不穀之不肖，而群臣莫能逮，吾國幾於亡乎！是以憂也。』楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。」武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」

Translating "不穀" – that's a humble term used by rulers, meaning "I, unworthy one." So "Bù gǔ" is the ruler's self-reference, so in translation, it's "I, unworthy," but in the translation, it's common to render it as "I am not worthy" or "I am unworthy."

"群臣莫能逮" – "no minister can match" or "no minister can surpass."

"退朝而有憂色" – after the meeting, had a worried expression.

"申公巫臣" – Shen Gong Wuchen, a minister's name.

"中蘬之言" – Zhonghui's words (assuming typo for 中虺).

"諸侯自為得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡。" – "Rulers who find teachers become kings, find friends become hegemon, find doubters survive, and those who plan alone and think no one is like themselves will perish."

"吾國幾於亡乎" – "our state is nearly perished."

"天使夫子振寡人之過也" – "Heaven has sent you, sir, to correct my mistakes."

So the translation should reflect all that. Let me check my draft again.

"King Wu of Wei planned something well, and none of his ministers could match him. After the meeting, he had a happy expression. Wu Qi approached and said, 'Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu?' King Wu of Wei replied, 'What were King Zhuang of Chu's words?' Wu Qi answered, 'King Zhuang of Chu planned something well, and none of his ministers could match him. After the meeting, he had a worried expression. Shen Gong Wuchen approached and asked, "Why do you have a worried expression after the meeting?" King Zhuang said, "I am unworthy, yet none of my ministers can match me. Therefore, I am worried. The words of Zhonghui say, 'A ruler who finds a teacher becomes a king, finds a friend becomes a hegemon, finds doubters survives, and one who plans alone and thinks no one is equal to himself will perish.' Now, because of my unworthiness, none of my ministers can match me, so our state is nearly perished. That is why I am worried." King Wu of Wei, after hearing this, hesitated and bowed twice, saying, 'Heaven has sent you, sir, to correct my mistakes.'"

Wait, "得疑者存" – "find doubters survives." So "those who find doubters (i.e., have ministers who doubt or challenge them) survive." So "find doubters" might be a bit awkward. Maybe "those who have ministers who doubt them survive." So "find doubters" is a bit of a translation issue. The Chinese says "得疑者存," where "得" is "to obtain" or "to have," so "those who have doubters survive." So "those who have ministers who doubt them survive."

So in the translation, it's better to say "those who have doubters survive" or "those who have ministers who question them survive."

Wait, "得疑者存" – "doubters" here refers to people who express doubt, so ministers who are willing to challenge the ruler's decisions. So "those who have ministers who doubt them survive."

So the translation should be: "A ruler who finds a teacher becomes a king, finds a friend becomes a hegemon, has ministers who doubt him survives, and one who plans alone and thinks no one is equal to himself will perish."

Wait, but the Chinese says "得疑者存," so "obtains doubters" or "has doubters." So "those who have doubters survive."

So the translation should be: "A ruler who finds a teacher becomes a king, finds a friend becomes a hegemon, has doubters survives, and one who plans alone and thinks no one is like himself will perish."

Wait, but "得疑者存" – "those who obtain doubters survive." So "those who have doubters (i.e., ministers who doubt) survive."

So the translation should be: "A ruler who finds a teacher becomes a king, finds a friend becomes a hegemon, has doubters survives, and one who plans alone and thinks no one is equal to himself will perish."

Hmm, maybe "those who have doubters survive" is better. So "a ruler who has doubters survives."

Wait, the structure is: "得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡." So "those who get teachers become kings, those who get friends become hegemon, those who get doubters survive, those who plan alone and think no one is like themselves perish."

So "those who find teachers become kings, find friends become hegemon, find doubters survive, and those who plan alone and think no one is like themselves perish."

So the translation should be: "A ruler who finds a teacher becomes a king, finds a friend becomes a hegemon, finds doubters survives, and one who plans alone and thinks no one is equal to himself will perish."

Wait, but "finds doubters" – "doubters" here is a bit odd. Maybe "those who have ministers who doubt them" but the Chinese uses "得疑者," so "those who obtain doubters." So "doubters" as in people who doubt, so "those who have doubters (i.e., critics) survive."

So the translation is a bit awkward, but that's how the Chinese is phrased. So I'll stick with "finds doubters survives" but maybe clarify in the translation as "those who have doubters survive."

Wait, but the Chinese says "得疑者存," so "those who get doubters survive." So "doubters" is the object. So "those who obtain doubters survive." So "those who have doubters survive."

So in the translation, it's "those who have doubters survive."

So the correct translation would be: "A ruler who finds a teacher becomes a king, finds a friend becomes a hegemon, has doubters survives, and one who plans alone and thinks no one is equal to himself will perish."

Wait, but "has doubters survives" – maybe "those who have doubters survive." So the phrase is "得疑者存," so "the one who gets doubters survives." So "those who have doubters survive."

So the translation should be: "A ruler who finds a teacher becomes a king, finds a friend becomes a hegemon, has doubters survives, and one who plans alone and thinks no one is equal to himself will perish."

Wait, but "has doubters survives" is a bit off. Maybe "one who has doubters survives." So the translation should be: "A ruler who finds a teacher becomes a king, finds a friend becomes a hegemon, has doubters survives, and one who plans alone and thinks no one is equal to himself will perish."

Wait, but the Chinese structure is parallel: "得師者王，得友者霸，得疑者存，自為謀而莫己若者亡." So each part is "X者Y," so "those who get X become Y." So "those who get teachers become kings," "those who get friends become hegemon," "those who get doubters survive," "those who plan alone and think no one is like themselves perish."

So the translation should be: "A ruler who finds a teacher becomes a king, finds a friend becomes a hegemon, finds doubters survives, and one who plans alone and thinks no one is equal to himself will perish."

Wait, but "finds doubters survives" – "finds doubters" is the action, "survives" is the result. So "those who find doubters survive." So "a ruler who finds doubters survives." So the translation should be: "A ruler who finds a teacher becomes a king, finds a friend becomes a hegemon, finds doubters survives, and one who plans alone and thinks no one is equal to himself will perish."

But "finds doubters" is a bit odd. Maybe "finds doubters" should be "has doubters" or "finds ministers who doubt." But the Chinese says "得疑者," so "doubters" as in people who doubt. So "those who obtain doubters (i.e., people who doubt) survive."

So the translation is a bit literal, but that's acceptable. So I'll go with "finds doubters survives" even though it's a bit awkward.

Now, checking the rest. "不穀" is the ruler's humble term, so "I, unworthy" or "I am unworthy." So "I am unworthy, yet none of my ministers can match me."

"吾國幾於亡乎" – "our state is nearly perished."

Okay, the translation seems accurate.

For part (2), the moral: The story illustrates the danger of overconfidence and the importance of humility in leadership. King Zhuang of Chu's worry stems from recognizing that his inability to be surpassed by his ministers indicates a lack of capable advisors, which could lead to the state's downfall. In contrast, King Wu of Wei's happiness reflects his arrogance, which is a dangerous trait. The moral is that a wise ruler should remain humble, seek out and value critical feedback from advisors, and avoid the hubris of believing they are infallible.

For part (3), the counterpart in Western thought: Yes, the concept of hubris (excessive pride leading to downfall) is a central theme in Greek tragedy, as seen in works like Sophocles' Oedipus Rex and Aeschylus' Agamemnon. Additionally, the biblical proverb "Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall" (Proverbs 16:18) echoes this moral. In Renaissance political thought, Niccolò Machiavelli, in The Prince, advises rulers to consult with wise counselors and avoid overreliance on their own judgment, aligning with the story's message.

Wait, but the user asked for "Western (European) thought," so Greek, Roman, medieval, Renaissance. So Greek tragedy is definitely part of Western European thought. So that's a solid counterpart.

Let me make sure there's no other Western counterpart. Maybe the Roman concept of "virtus" (courage, excellence) but that's more about personal virtue. The key here is the danger of pride, so hubris is the main counterpart.

Okay, I think that's covered.

Now, putting it all together. The user wants the translation, the moral, and the Western counterpart.

Wait, the user said "You can keep the proper names in Chinese," so names like 魏武侯, 吳起, 楚莊王, 申公巫臣, 中蘬 should be kept as is, but transliterated. So in the translation, it's "King Wu of Wei," "Wu Qi," "King Zhuang of Chu," "Shen Gong Wuchen," "Zhonghui."

Wait, "中蘬" is transliterated as "Zhonghui," but as I thought earlier, it's likely a typo for 中虺 (Zhonghui), so "Zhonghui" is the correct transliteration. So I'll use "Zhonghui" in the translation.

Wait, but the user wrote "中蘬," so maybe they meant "Zhonghui" as a transliteration. So I'll go with "Zhonghui."

So the translation should have "Zhonghui's words."

Okay, that's settled.

Now, let me write the three parts as per the user's request.

(1) Translation: As above.

(2) Moral: The moral is that a leader should remain humble, recognize their own limitations, and seek out advisors who can provide critical feedback, as overconfidence and self-reliance can lead to the downfall of the state.

(3) Western counterpart: Yes, the concept of hubris in Greek tragedy (e.g., Oedipus Rex) and the biblical warning against pride (Proverbs 16:18) serve as counterparts. Additionally, Machiavelli's advice in The Prince on the importance of consulting wise counselors aligns with this moral.

Wait, but the user asked "does the concepts in the story have a counterpart in Western (European) thought?" So the concepts are: the danger of self-aggrandizement leading to downfall, the importance of having advisors who challenge the ruler.

So the main concept is the danger of hubris, which is a Western concept. So the answer is yes, with examples.

I think that's all. Let me check if I missed anything. The user provided the passage, so the translation should be accurate. The moral is correctly identified. The Western counterpart is correctly identified with examples.

Wait, but in the story, it's not just about hubris, but specifically about the ruler not having ministers who can match them, which leads to the state's danger. So the key point is that the ruler's inability to have capable ministers (because they're all inferior) is the problem. So the moral is that a ruler should have ministers who are capable and can challenge them, so that the ruler doesn't become overconfident. So the counterpart would be the idea that a ruler needs good advisors, which is present in Western thought as well. So Machiavelli's The Prince does talk about the importance of having good advisors. So that's another point.

So in part (3), I should mention both the hubris concept and the importance of advisors, as in Machiavelli.

Yes, so the answer should include both the hubris (Greek) and the advisory concept (Machiavelli).

Okay, that's covered.

I think that's all. Let me make sure the translation is correct. Let me check a few more points.

"退朝而有喜色" – "after the meeting, had a happy expression." Correct.

"楚莊王以憂，而君以喜。" – "King Zhuang of Chu was worried, but you (the king) are happy." So the contrast is important.

"武侯逡巡再拜曰：「天使夫子振寡人之過也。」" – "King Wu of Wei hesitated and bowed twice, saying, 'Heaven has sent you, sir, to correct my mistakes.'"

"振" is to correct or rectify, so "correct my mistakes."

Yes, that's right.

Okay, I think the translation is good.

So the final answer should have the three parts as requested.
</think>

(1) **Translation:**  
King Wu of Wei planned something well, and none of his ministers could match him. After the meeting, he wore a happy expression. Wu Qi approached and said, "Have you ever heard the words of King Zhuang of Chu?" King Wu of Wei replied, "What were King Zhuang of Chu’s words?" Wu Qi answered, "King Zhuang of Chu planned something well, and none of his ministers could match him. After the meeting, he wore a worried expression. Shen Gong Wuchen approached and asked, *‘Why do you wear a worried expression after the meeting?’* King Zhuang said, *‘I am unworthy, yet none of my ministers can match me. Therefore, I am worried. The words of Zhonghui say: “A ruler who finds a teacher becomes a king, finds a friend becomes a hegemon, finds doubters survives, and one who plans alone and thinks no one is equal to himself will perish.” Now, because of my unworthiness, none of my ministers can match me, so our state is nearly perished. That is why I am worried.’* King Zhuang of Chu was worried, but you are happy." King Wu of Wei hesitated and bowed twice, saying, *"Heaven has sent you, sir, to correct my mistakes."*

---

(2) **Moral of the Story:**  
The story emphasizes the danger of overconfidence and the importance of humility in leadership. King Zhuang of Chu’s worry stems from recognizing that his ministers’ inability to match his judgment indicates a lack of capable advisors—those who can challenge and refine his decisions. This self-awareness prevents complacency and safeguards the state. In contrast, King Wu of Wei’s happiness reflects arrogance, a trait that risks the state’s survival. The moral is that a wise ruler must remain humble, actively seek out critical feedback from capable advisors, and avoid the hubris of believing their own judgment is infallible. Only through such humility and collaboration can a ruler ensure the stability and prosperity of their state.

---

(3) **Counterpart in Western (European) Thought:**  
Yes, the core concepts of the story have clear counterparts in Western thought. The central idea—that excessive pride (*hubris*) leads to downfall—is a cornerstone of Greek tragedy. For example, in Sophocles’ *Oedipus Rex*, Oedipus’s arrogance in defying prophecy results in his tragic ruin, embodying the Greek maxim *“hubris leads to nemesis”* (retribution). Similarly, the biblical proverb *“Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall”* (Proverbs 16:18) echoes this moral.  

Additionally, the emphasis on the ruler’s need for critical advisors aligns with Renaissance political thought. In *The Prince* (1513), Niccolò Machiavelli advises rulers to consult wise counselors and avoid overreliance on their own judgment, stressing that a leader’s success depends on surrounding themselves with capable, honest advisors who can challenge their decisions. This mirrors the story’s message that a ruler who lacks such advisors risks the state’s collapse.  

Thus, the story’s moral finds resonance in both classical Greek tragedy (via *hubris*) and later European political philosophy (via Machiavelli’s counsel on governance). [end of text]
