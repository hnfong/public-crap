### Q6: At the end of 滑稽列传, it is said that: "傳曰：「子產治鄭，民不能欺；子賤治單父，民不忍欺；西門豹治鄴，民不敢欺。」三子之才能誰最賢哉？辨治者當能別之。" -- explain what it means, and whether the comment is fair. (15 points)
This passage means: "It is said that Zichan governed Zheng, and the people could not deceive him; Zijian governed Shanfu, and the people were unwilling to deceive him; Ximen Bao governed Ye, and the people did not dare to deceive him. Among these three, who was the most virtuous? Those who can discern governance should be able to distinguish."

The comment is fair in that it highlights the different approaches and outcomes of each governor:
- **Zichan** was known for his wisdom and fairness, making it impossible for the people to deceive him.
- **Zijian** was known for his benevolence and moral influence, making the people unwilling to deceive him.
- **Ximen Bao** was known for his firmness and justice, making the people afraid to deceive him.

Each governor had a unique approach, and the comment suggests that a discerning observer can evaluate their relative virtues based on their methods and results. [end of text]
