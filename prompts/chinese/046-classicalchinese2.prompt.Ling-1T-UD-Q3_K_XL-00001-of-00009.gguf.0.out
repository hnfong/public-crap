### (1) **English Translation**

King Wuling of Wei (魏武侯) deliberated on a matter and made a decision that was appropriate. None of his ministers could match his judgment. After retiring from court, he wore a look of joy.

Wu Qi (吳起) approached him and said: "Has Your Majesty perhaps heard the ministers speak of what King Zhuang of Chu (楚莊王) once said?"

Wuling asked: "What did King Zhuang of Chu say?"

Wu Qi replied: "King Zhuang of Chu deliberated on a matter and made an appropriate decision. None of his ministers could match him. After retiring from court, he wore a look of worry.

"His minister Shen Gong Wuchi (申公巫臣) stepped forward and asked: 'You retired with a worried expression. Why is that?'

"The king said: 'I made a decision that was right, and none of my ministers could match me. That is why I am worried. As Zhong'er [a wise minister] once said: "When a feudal lord finds a teacher among the feudal lords, he becomes a king; when he finds a friend, he becomes a hegemon; when he finds an equal, he survives; but when he relies only on his own counsel and no one compares to him, he is doomed to perish." Now, given my lack of virtue, and that none of my ministers can match me, my state is close to ruin! That is why I am worried.'

"King Zhuang of Chu was worried because of this, but Your Majesty is joyful because of it."

King Wuling, abashed, bowed twice and said: "It was Heaven that sent you, Master, to correct my fault."

### (2) **Moral of the Story**

The moral is: **A ruler should not be pleased when his wisdom surpasses all his ministers, but rather should be concerned, for such unmatched superiority may indicate a lack of capable advisors and thus endanger the state.**

In other words:
- True strength lies not in the ruler’s individual brilliance, but in having ministers who can challenge, advise, and complement him.
- If no minister can match the ruler’s judgment, it suggests the ruler is isolated, lacks honest counsel, and the state is at risk of collapse due to unchecked decisions.
- Humility and receptiveness to criticism are essential virtues of good leadership.

This reflects Xunzi’s Confucian view that governance depends on collective wisdom, moral cultivation, and institutional checks, not the infallibility of the sovereign.

### (3) **Counterparts in Western (European) Thought**

Yes, several parallels exist:

#### **1. Aristotle – The Mixed Constitution & Deliberation**
Aristotle, in *Politics*, argues that the best constitutions blend elements (monarchy, aristocracy, democracy) to avoid tyranny of one. He emphasizes collective deliberation: decisions made by many (or a diverse council) are often superior to those of a single wise individual, because collective wisdom incorporates multiple perspectives.

> Parallel: Just as King Zhuang worries when no one challenges him, Aristotle distrusts absolute rule and values institutionalized dissent.

#### **2. Cicero – The Republic & the Role of Advisors**
In *De Republica*, Cicero (via Scipio) stresses that a ruler must surround himself with wise counselors. A republic thrives when leaders listen to the *senatus* (senate) and are open to correction.

> "The ruler who relies only on himself is not just, but tyrannical."

#### **3. Machiavelli – The Prince and the Danger of Flattery**
Machiavelli warns in *The Prince* (Chapter XXIII) that rulers who isolate themselves from truthful advice are doomed:
> "There is no other way to guard yourself against flattery than by making it understood that the truth will not offend you."

He praises rulers who welcome honest counsel, echoing the Xunzi passage’s critique of unchallenged wisdom.

#### **4. Montesquieu – Separation of Powers**
In *The Spirit of the Laws*, Montesquieu argues that power must be checked by other powers. A ruler unchecked by ministers, courts, or assemblies becomes despotic.

> Parallel: The absence of "equals" or "teachers" among ministers leads to ruin — akin to the absence of institutional checks.

#### **5. Modern Democratic Theory – Dissent as Safeguard**
The idea that "dissent is the highest form of patriotism" or that cabinets, oppositions, and judicial reviews exist to check executive overreach is a modern institutional embodiment of this ancient insight.

### Summary

- **Moral**: A ruler’s isolation is dangerous; collective wisdom and critical ministers are essential for state survival.
- **Western Parallels**: Found in Aristotle’s politics, Cicero’s republicanism, Machiavelli’s realism, Montesquieu’s separation of powers, and modern democratic theory — all emphasizing that unchecked power, even when "wise," corrupts and endangers the polity.

Thus, Xunzi’s 3rd-century BCE insight resonates deeply with a core strand of Western political philosophy: **power must be tempered by dialogue, dissent, and institutional humility.** [end of text]
