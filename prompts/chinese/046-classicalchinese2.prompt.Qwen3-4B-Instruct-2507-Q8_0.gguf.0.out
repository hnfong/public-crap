(1) **English Translation:**

King Wei Wu of Wei was planning matters and succeeded in making sound decisions; no minister could match him. After the court session, he showed a happy expression. Wu Qi said, "Have you ever heard, on the side, of what King Chu Zangwang once said?" The king replied, "What did King Chu Zangwang say?" Wu Qi replied, "When King Chu Zangwang made sound decisions and no minister could match him, he showed a look of worry. When Shen Gong Wuchen asked, 'Why do you show such concern?' King Chu said, 'I have made sound decisions, and no minister can match me—this is what worries me. The saying in the middle of the state (referring to a wise saying) says: "A ruler who finds a teacher among the states will become a king; one who finds a friend will become a hegemon; one who finds a doubt will survive; but one who relies solely on his own judgment and believes no one else can surpass him will perish." Now, since I am not a wise ruler, and yet no minister can match me, I fear our state is on the verge of destruction. That is why I am worried.' King Chu was worried, while you, Your Majesty, are happy." The king, startled and humbled, bowed twice and said, "The heavens have sent you to correct my mistake!"

(2) **Moral of the Story:**

The moral of the story is a powerful warning against **arrogance and overconfidence in one's own judgment**. While Wei Wu’s success in decision-making is admirable, the story contrasts it with the wisdom of King Chu Zangwang, who, despite making sound decisions, felt **worry** because he recognized that **true strength lies not in personal brilliance alone**, but in **the ability to learn from others, to be open to criticism, and to recognize one’s own limitations**.

The key idea is that **a ruler who believes he is superior to all others and who relies solely on his own judgment is vulnerable to downfall**. In contrast, a wise ruler acknowledges that even when he is correct, others may offer valuable perspectives, and that **true power and stability come from humility, openness, and the willingness to learn from others**.

This reflects a Confucian value: **self-awareness, humility, and the importance of collective wisdom** over individual pride.

(3) **Counterpart in Western (European) Thought?**

Yes, the concepts in this story have clear counterparts in Western philosophical and political thought, especially in:

- **Aristotle’s concept of *phronesis* (practical wisdom)**: Aristotle emphasized that wise rulers must not only make good decisions but also understand the context, recognize their own limitations, and be open to advice. In *Nicomachean Ethics*, he argues that true wisdom involves knowing when to act and when to defer to others.

- **The idea of "hubris" (excessive pride)**: In Greek tragedy and philosophy, *hubris* is the fatal flaw of a hero who overestimates their own power or wisdom. This is directly parallel to Wei Wu’s pride in his own success. In *Oedipus Rex*, for example, Oedipus’s pride leads to his downfall. Similarly, in the story, King Wei Wu’s joy over being unmatched is a form of *hubris* that leads to self-deception.

- **The concept of "virtue ethics" and humility**: Thinkers like **St. Augustine** and **St. Thomas Aquinas** emphasized that true virtue includes humility and the recognition of one’s dependence on divine or communal wisdom. In political philosophy, **Niccolò Machiavelli** and later **John Locke** also stressed the importance of rulers being open to counsel and recognizing that no individual can possess all knowledge.

- **Modern political theory**: The idea that **a leader should be open to criticism and feedback** is central to democratic governance and leadership development. Thinkers like **Peter Drucker** and **David McClelland** emphasize that effective leaders are those who listen, learn, and remain humble.

Thus, while the language and context differ, the **core idea—that pride in one’s own judgment leads to downfall, and that humility and openness to others are essential for wise leadership**—is deeply rooted in Western thought.

**In summary**:  
This passage from *Xunzi* teaches that **true wisdom lies not in being unmatched, but in recognizing one’s limitations and valuing the input of others**. This moral is not only ancient Chinese but also deeply resonant in Western philosophy and political thought, where humility, self-awareness, and the pursuit of collective wisdom are seen as essential to leadership and societal stability.
