Q1: The story tells of how West Gate Lord (西门豹) as the governor of Ye County (邺县) discovered that the local people were suffering due to the custom of the river god's bride. He cleverly used this situation to expose the corruption of the local officials and priests, and then cleverly manipulated the situation to save the people from the burden of this practice. He then organized the construction of twelve irrigation channels, which brought great benefits to the people.

Q2: The story does not explicitly mention the type of women who were usually the victims. However, it can be inferred that the practice of offering girls to the river god was a form of human sacrifice, and the victims were likely young girls.

Q3: The old practice of offering girls to the river god benefited the local officials and priests, who collected money from the people to pay for the ritual.

Q4: The protagonist used wits to deal with the situation. He cleverly exposed the corruption of the local officials and priests, and then manipulated the situation to save the people from the burden of this practice. He did not use force, but rather used his intelligence and wit to solve the problem.

Q5: This action can be viewed from various perspectives. From a moral standpoint, the protagonist's actions can be seen as a form of justice and a way to protect the people from exploitation. However, from a legal and ethical standpoint, the practice of human sacrifice was morally wrong. The protagonist's actions may have been seen as a form of revenge or retribution rather than a fair and just solution.

Q6: The comment in 滑稽列传 means that the three officials, Ziyuàn (子产), Zǐ Jiàn (子贱), and West Gate Lord (西门豹), each had their own strengths in governance. The comment suggests that the ability to distinguish between different forms of governance is important. Whether this comment is fair depends on one's perspective. From a moral standpoint, Ziyuàn and Zǐ Jiàn's governance was more humane and just, while West Gate Lord's governance was more pragmatic and effective. From a practical standpoint, West Gate Lord's governance brought immediate benefits to the people, but it was also criticized for its lack of moral integrity. Therefore, the comment is fair in that it highlights the different approaches and outcomes of governance, but it may not be entirely fair in terms of moral judgment. [end of text]
