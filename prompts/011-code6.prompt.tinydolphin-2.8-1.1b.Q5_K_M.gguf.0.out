Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

 Yes, there are some inputs that will lead to the output "Done" when you run this program. Here are two examples:

1. If you input 2.0, the program will print 4.0.
2. If you input -1.0, the program will print 0.0.

These are the inputs that will lead to the 'Done' message.<|im_end|>
