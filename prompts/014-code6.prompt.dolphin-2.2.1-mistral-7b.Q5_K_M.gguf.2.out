Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

 Yes, there are inputs that will result in the "Done" output. For example:

1. If the input is a positive number (e.g., `inc = 0.1`), the program will iterate through the loop until x reaches infinity, and then the loop will terminate with the "Done" message.
2. If the input is a negative number (e.g., `inc = -0.1`), the program will also iterate through the loop until x reaches infinity, but this time from negative to positive values, and again the loop will terminate with the "Done" message.<|im_end|>
