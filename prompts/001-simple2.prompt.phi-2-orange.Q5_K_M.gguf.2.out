Answer for Q1:
The number 120 has several interesting properties and is known as an abundant number, a happy number, a semiprime, and a sphenic number. Here are some of its unique properties:

- Prime factors: 2^3 * 3 * 5.
- Divisor sum: 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 17 (it is the smallest abundant number for which the divisor sum equals the number itself).
- Prod(divisors): 1*2*2*3*4*5 = 120. This makes 120 a sphenic number, which has three distinct prime factors.
- Mertens' function: M(120) = Σ[a, b] for all coprime integers a and b such that ab < 120, where the summation ranges from 2 to 12 (excluding 11). M(120) = 77, so it is an abundant number.

Answer for Q2:
To solve x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, follow these steps:

1. Factorize the quadratic equation: (x - 9)(x + 2) = 0
2. Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x:
   - For (x - 9): x = 9
   - For (x + 2): x = -2
3. The solutions are x = 9 and x = -2. 

Answer for Q3:
A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. To find the number of round trips within a full day (24 hours), follow these steps:

1. Calculate the time it takes to travel one way: 200 km / 60 km/h = 3.33 hours (approximately)
2. Since the time stationed in the cities is negligible, we'll only focus on the train's motion between the two cities. Therefore, the total time for each round trip would be half of the one-way trip: 3.33 hours / 2 = 1.67 hours (approximately)
3. Within a full day (24 hours), find out how many rounds of trips can be made in that amount of time: 24 hours / 1.67 hours ≈ 14 trips (round down to the nearest whole number since we can't make a fraction of a trip). 

So, within a full day, this train can make approximately 14 round trips between the two cities.
