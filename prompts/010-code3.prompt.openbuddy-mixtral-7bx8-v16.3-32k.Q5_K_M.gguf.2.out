Consider the following python code:

```
def s(a):
    if len(a) <= 1: return a
    p = a[0]
    l = [x for x in a[1:] if x <= p]
    r = [x for x in a[1:] if x > p]
    return l + [p,] + r
```

What is its intended purpose? Then, please review the code, focusing on mistakes (if any), coding style, efficiency, and any other implementation details that may be of note. Finally, write a new function with all your suggested fixes/improvements, but in the Rust language (not in python).

The intended purpose of this code is to sort a list of numbers using a recursive approach. The algorithm used here seems to be similar to QuickSort, where it partitions the array into two parts based on a pivot element (in this case, the first element), and then sorts those sub-arrays independently.

However, there are a few issues with the code:
1. Recursion is not properly implemented for sorting the sub-arrays. The function `s` should be called recursively on both sorted partitions (l and r) instead of just returning them as lists.
2. There's no base case to stop the recursion when the list size is 1 or smaller, which would cause infinite recursion.
3. Coding style can improve by using more descriptive variable names like `pivot` for 'p', and making sure that the function name clearly represents its purpose (e.g., 'sort_list').
4. Efficiency-wise, this implementation has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to partitioning the array multiple times without recursively sorting sub-arrays. A better approach would be to use QuickSort or another more efficient algorithm for improved performance.
5. The code does not handle cases where all elements are equal and could potentially cause infinite loops when trying to find pivot element indexes that satisfy conditions in the partition step.
6. This implementation is not stable, meaning it may change the relative order of equivalent elements within the list.

Here's a revised version of the function in Python:
```python
def sort_list(a):
    if len(a) <= 1: return a
    
    pivot = a[0]
    left, right = [], []
    
    for x in a[1:]:
        if x < pivot:
            left.append(x)
        elif x > pivot:
            right.append(x)
        
    return sort_list(left) + [pivot] + sort_list(right)
```
Now, let's translate the improved version of this function to Rust language:
```rust
fn partition<'a>(mut left: &[&'a i32], mut right: &[&'a i32]) -> Vec<i32> {
    if left.is_empty() && !right.is_empty() {
        return right.to_vec();
    }
    
    let pivot = *left.last().unwrap();
    left.retain(|&x| x < pivot);
    right.retain(|&x| x > pivot || (x == pivot && !right.contains(&pivot)));
    
    partition(left, &right) + vec![pivot] + partition(&left[..], right)
}

fn quicksort<'a>(mut a: Vec<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    if a.len() <= 1 { return a; }
    
    let left = Vec::new();
    let right = a.clone(); // Clone the original vector to avoid borrowing issues
    
    partition(&left, &right) + vec![a[0]] + partition(&left[..], right)
}
```
Please note that this Rust implementation has some limitations due to the borrow-checker and lifetimes. It also uses cloning for simplicity, which may not be ideal in terms of performance when working with large datasets. For real-world applications, a more sophisticated implementation would be needed.
