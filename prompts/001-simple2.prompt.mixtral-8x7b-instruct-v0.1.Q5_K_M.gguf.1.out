Q1: What is the significance of the number 120? Tell me some of its interesting properties.

Q2: Solve the equation: x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0

Q3: A train travels at an average speed of 60 km/h between two cities that are 200km apart. Assume the time stationed in the cities is negligible, how many round trips can it make between the two cities within a full day?

 [/INST] A1: The number 120 is a highly composite number, which means it has more divisors than any number smaller than it. It's also a pronic number (the product of two consecutive integers), as it can be expressed as 120 = 10 * 12. Here are some of its interesting properties:

- It is divisible by every integer from 1 to 6 (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 40, 60).
- It is the smallest number with exactly 16 divisors.
- In base 10, it is a Harshad number, being divisible by the sum of its digits (1 + 2 + 0 = 3; 120 mod 3 = 0).

A2: To solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 7x - 18 = 0, we can use factoring or the quadratic formula. Here, we'll demonstrate factoring:

x^2 - 7x - 18 = (x - 9)(x + 2)

So, x - 9 = 0 or x + 2 = 0
x = 9 or x = -2

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are x = 9 and x = -2.

A3: To find out how many round trips a train can make between two cities within a full day at an average speed of 60 km/h, we first need to determine the time it takes for one round trip. Since the distance is 200 km, the time taken for a single leg of the journey is:

t = d / s = 200 km / 60 km/h = 10/3 hours (approximately)

For a round trip, the total time is twice this amount:

T_round_trip = 2 * t = 20/3 hours (approximately)

Now, to find out how many round trips can be made within a full day, we need to determine the number of 24-hour periods that fit into the total time available. Since there are 24 hours in a day, this becomes:

number_of_round_trips = 24 hours / (20/3) hours/round_trip â‰ˆ 3.6 round trips

However, since it's not possible to have a fraction of a round trip, we must round down to the nearest whole number:

number_of_round_trips = 3 round trips (approximately)
