Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Sure, here are two examples of inputs that will produce the expected output:

1. Enter a number: 2.0
```
x = 2.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
     x += inc
print("Done")
```
Output: "Done"

2. Enter a number: -5.5
```
x = -5.5
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
     x += inc
print("Done")
```
Output: "Done"
