What is the output of the following python program?

import math
x = 1.0
while x < math.inf:
    x = x * 1.001
print(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The given code will not terminate and give any output because it is in an infinite loop due to the use of `math.inf` which represents infinity in Python. The value of x keeps on getting multiplied by 1.001 until it reaches a point where the result becomes too large for Python to handle, causing the program to crash or freeze.
