What is the eventual output of the following python program?

import math
x = 0.0
while x < math.inf:
    x += 1.0
print(x)
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
The program will print "inf" as output, because the value of x is increased by 1 each time in a while loop and it starts from 0. So, after incrementing for infinite times it reaches to infinity (math.inf). Therefore, when the condition `x < math.inf` is evaluated, it will always be true since an infinite number cannot be greater than another infinity. The program would result into a infinite loop and print 'infinite' as output.
