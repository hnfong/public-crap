Consider the following program:

```
import math
x = 0.0
inc = float(input("Enter a number"))
while x < math.inf:
    x += inc
print("Done")
```

Is there some inputs that will lead to the output "Done"? Give at least 2 examples of such inputs if possible.

Yes, there are inputs that will lead to the output "Done" in the given program. Here are two examples of such inputs:

1. Negative numbers: If you input a negative number, the value of `x` will never reach infinity since it will decrease with each iteration. As a result, the loop will eventually end, and the program will print "Done".
2. Zero: If you input zero, the value of `x` will remain zero, and the loop will not run since `x` is not less than infinity. The program will then print "Done".

In both cases, the program will output "Done" because the loop condition `x < math.inf` will become false.</s>
