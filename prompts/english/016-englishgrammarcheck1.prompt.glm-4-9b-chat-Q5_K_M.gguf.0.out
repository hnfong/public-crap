Grammar Mistakes and Agreement Issues:
1. "So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..." - The phrase "are not doing enough real work" should be "do not do enough real work" for subject-verb agreement.
2. "And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something..." - "he's" should be "he is" for subject-verb agreement.
3. "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional..." - "it seems" should be "it seemed" to match the past tense of the sentence.
4. "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." - "McKinsey Pichai" should be "Sundar Pichai" as the CEO of Google is Sundar Pichai, not McKinsey Pichai.
5. "In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid." - "the logic is solid" should be "the logic was solid" to match the past tense of the surrounding sentences.
6. "The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." - "they're" should be "they are" for subject-verb agreement.
7. "Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another." - "knows" should be "knows" for subject-verb agreement.
8. "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing)." - "expectation what" should be "expect what" for clarity.
9. "But I always knew we're in a state of flux." - "we're" should be "we are" for subject-verb agreement.
10. "Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances)." - "we're" should be "we are" for subject-verb agreement.

Serious Stylistic Issues:
1. The use of "GOOG" and "META" without explanation or definition can be confusing for readers who are not familiar with these terms.
2. The phrase "layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit" is repetitive with "reduce costs and increase margins and profit."
3. The sentence "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." is awkwardly structured and could be simplified for clarity.
4. The phrase "product enshittification" is informal and may not be understood by all readers.
5. The sentence "Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance." is metaphorical and may not be clear to all readers without context.

Other Problems:
1. The sentence "In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid." is a run-on sentence that could be split into two for better readability.
2. The phrase "There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn..." is awkwardly structured and could be rephrased for clarity.
3. The sentence "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing)." is awkwardly structured and could be simplified.
4. The phrase "Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry..." is a bit abrupt and could be softened for a more fluid transition.
5. The sentence "my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses" is informal and may not be understood by all readers. [end of text]
