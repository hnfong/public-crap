Here are the answers:

## 1. The letter "A" in number spelling

**One thousand** (1,000) — or more precisely, **one hundred and one** if you use the British "and," but **one thousand** is the first without any "and."

Actually, checking more carefully: **one hundred and one** (British) or **one thousand** (American). The cleanest answer is **one thousand**.

Wait — let me reconsider: **one hundred and one** contains "and" which has an "a." So the first number without any "a" at all would be **one thousand** in American English, or if we avoid "and" entirely, you'd need to reach **one million** to be completely safe? 

Actually, the classic answer to this riddle is: **one thousand** — because "one," "hundred," and "thousand" contain no letter "a."

## 2. "The quick brown fox..."

**"...jumps over the lazy dog."**

It's famous for being a **pangram** — a sentence that contains **every letter of the English alphabet at least once**. Typists and font designers have used it for decades to test keyboards and display fonts.

## 3. The Three Little Pigs and Little Red Riding Hood

The three pigs had just finished their brick house when a knock came at the door. To their surprise, it wasn't the wolf—it was a little girl in a red cape, carrying a basket.

"Grandmother's house is just through these woods," she explained, "but I heard a wolf lives nearby."

The pigs exchanged glances. "That wolf tried to blow our houses down," said the practical one. "He's dangerous."

"Then we should go together," suggested the second pig.

So the four of them set off through the forest. When they reached grandmother's cottage, they found the wolf disguised in bed, just as Red suspected. But this time, the pigs were prepared. While Red kept him talking, the pigs gathered stones from the garden and blocked the chimney.

When the wolf tried to escape, he found himself trapped. The constable happened by—Red's basket was for him, containing evidence of the wolf's other crimes.

The wolf was carted off to prison. Grandmother, freed from the wardrobe, made them all tea. And the three pigs? They built a guest cottage in their garden, where a certain girl in red often visited. Some friendships, they discovered, were worth crossing into other stories for. [end of text]
