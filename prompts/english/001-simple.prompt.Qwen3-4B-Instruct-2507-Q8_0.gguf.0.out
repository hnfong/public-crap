**1. How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?**

So, the answer is: **You would use the letter "A" when you count to 1.**

Even though "one" is the first number, it contains the letter "a" (or "A" in uppercase).  
Therefore, you don’t need to go very far — **you use "A" at one**.

**3. Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.**

**Title: "The Three Little Pigs and Little Red Riding Hood"**

Once upon a time, in a cozy village nestled between rolling hills and a whispering forest, three little pigs built their homes — one with straw, one with sticks, and one with bricks. The wise old owl, who lived in a tree above the village, often told them, “Build strong, build safe — the world is full of surprises.”

One sunny morning, the little red riding hood, a kind and curious girl, was visiting her grandmother in the woods. She met the three little pigs on her way.

“Hello, little pig!” said Red Riding Hood, stopping at the straw house. “I’m going to visit my grandmother. Is she well?”

The first little pig, with a straw house, giggled. “Oh, you’re so brave! But I don’t think you should go into the woods — it’s full of dangers!”

Red Riding Hood smiled. “I have my basket and my knife. I’m careful.”

She continued to the stick house, where the second pig lived. “Hello, little pig! I’m on my way to Grandma’s.”

The second pig, with a stick house, frowned. “The woods are tricky. I’ve seen wolves before. But I’ll go with you — just don’t wander too far.”

Red Riding Hood nodded. “I’ll stay on the path.”

Finally, she reached the brick house, where the third pig lived. “Hello, strong little pig! I’m visiting Grandma. Is she okay?”

The third pig, with a sturdy brick house, smiled. “Yes, she’s fine. But I’ve seen a wolf near the forest. I’ve built a strong fence and a gate. I’ll help you if you need it.”

Red Riding Hood thanked them all and continued on her way.

On her journey, a hungry wolf appeared — but he didn’t attack. Instead, he sat quietly and said, “I’ve seen the three little pigs. I know how strong the brick house is. I’ll wait until the next time.”

The next day, the wolf returned — but this time, he tried to sneak into the stick house. The second pig caught him with a net and said, “You’re not welcome here.”

The wolf, now wise, said, “I see now — strength and kindness matter more than fear.”

From that day on, the three little pigs and Red Riding Hood became friends. They all learned that **a strong home, a kind heart, and a safe path** are the best defenses in the world.

And so, they lived happily ever after — with stories shared under the stars.

✨ *Moral: Be kind, build wisely, and always stay safe — even in the woods.*
