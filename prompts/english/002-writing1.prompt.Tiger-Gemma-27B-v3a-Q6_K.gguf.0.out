## The Stone Heart and the Wildflowers

Old Man Tiber lived in a house built of grey stone, as cold and unyielding as his heart. He hadn't smiled in decades, not since his wife, Elara, had passed. He spent his days polishing his collection of smooth, grey river stones, arranging them just so on his windowsill. He claimed they were beautiful, perfect, unlike the messy, fleeting beauty of… well, everything else. 

The village children whispered he’d turned to stone himself, inside. They avoided his garden, which was nothing but neatly raked gravel. Even the birds seemed to fly around it, not *into* it.

One spring, a little girl named Lyra started leaving wildflowers at his gate. Not grand bouquets, just single, bright blooms tucked into the iron bars. Tiber would scowl, sweep them away with a broom, and mutter about weeds. 

Lyra didn’t stop. She kept bringing them. One day, she left a tiny, hand-stitched **pillow** filled with lavender, tucked amongst the petals of a dandelion. Tiber almost threw it in the fire. Instead, he picked it up, the scent strangely…pleasant.

“She’s **exaggerating** the kindness, that one,” he grumbled to his cat, a scrawny thing named Dust. “Thinks a few flowers will melt a lifetime of grief. Ridiculous.”

But he didn’t throw the pillow away. He left it on his chair. 

Lyra, meanwhile, kept talking to him. Not *at* him, but *to* him. She’d sit on the other side of the gate, telling him about her day, about the fluffy white **cloud** she’d seen shaped like a dragon, about the robin building a nest in her apple tree. Tiber would pretend not to listen, but he did. He found himself straightening the stones on his windowsill less often, just to hear her voice a little longer.

One afternoon, Lyra brought him a single, perfect bluebell. “My grandma says bluebells mean kindness,” she said, her voice small. “She says kindness is like sunshine. It can warm even the coldest stones.”

Tiber scoffed. “Nonsense.” But his hand trembled as he took the flower. He held it, turning it over and over. It was fragile, ephemeral. Unlike his stones. 

That night, he dreamt of Elara. Not the sad, faded memory he usually carried, but a vibrant, laughing Elara, surrounded by wildflowers. He woke with a strange ache in his chest, not of grief, but…something else. 

The next morning, he found Lyra tending a small patch of wildflowers she’d planted just inside his gate. He didn’t scold her. He didn’t sweep them away. He just stood there, watching. 

Finally, he cleared his throat. “They’re…messy,” he said, his voice rusty.

Lyra smiled. “They are. But they’re pretty, aren’t they?”

Tiber looked at the riot of color, at the way the sunlight caught the petals. He looked at Lyra, her face bright with hope. And for the first time in decades, a tiny crack appeared in his stone heart. 

He didn’t say anything. He didn’t need to. He simply picked up a handful of gravel and, instead of arranging it neatly, he scattered it amongst the wildflowers. 

It wasn’t much. But it was a start. He was learning, slowly, that even the coldest stone could be warmed by the smallest spark of love, and that sometimes, the most beautiful things in life weren't perfect, but messy, fleeting, and utterly, wonderfully alive.
