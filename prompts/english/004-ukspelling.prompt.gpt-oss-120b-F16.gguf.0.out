My favourite rainbows are the ones that appear after a summer shower, when the air smells fresh and the grass is still wet.

The colours are bright and clear: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. They sit side by side, each one thin and shining. I imagine they are made of tiny drops of water that have caught the sunâ€™s light and turned it into colour.

Sometimes a rainbow looks like a thin line, almost hidden behind a cloud. Other times it is a bold arch that seems to touch the ground. I love to run to the end, even though I know I will never reach it. The thought that the rainbow is there, waiting for anyone who looks up, makes my heart feel light and happy. [end of text]
