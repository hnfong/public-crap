They appear like a soft, colourful bridge stretching across the sky, each band a bright stripe of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. 

The first rainbow I see is shy, low over the garden, its colours reflected in the puddles. I can see a tiny fishâ€‘shaped splash of blue and a bright orange that looks like a slice of carrot. The next one is higher, bold and wide, as if the clouds have painted a giant smile for the world.

I sit on the grass, my boots muddy, and watch the light dance on the wet leaves. The air smells of fresh earth and sweet rain. When the sun peeks out, the rainbow glows even more, and I feel a warm, quiet magic inside me. 

Rainbows are my secret treasure, a promise that after every storm, colour will return. [end of text]
