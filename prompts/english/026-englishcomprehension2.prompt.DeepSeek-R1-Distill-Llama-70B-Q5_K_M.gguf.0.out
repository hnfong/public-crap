Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the color of this unknown block. Let me start by breaking down the information given step by step.

First, the initial setup: there are 3 black blocks on top of an unknown block, and beneath them is a blue block. So the order from top to bottom is: 3 black blocks, then the unknown block, then a blue block.

Then, all the blocks are removed and shuffled, with an additional green block added. After shuffling, they're stacked again, and now the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

Wait, hold on. The problem mentions a yellow block, but it wasn't part of the original setup. So the original blocks were 3 black, one unknown, and one blue. Then we add a green block, making the total number of blocks 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6 blocks. After shuffling, the yellow block is on top of the blue one. But wait, where did the yellow block come from? The original blocks didn't include a yellow one, so maybe that's a typo or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the yellow block is the unknown one? Let me re-read the problem.

The problem says: "There are 3 black blocks on top of a block we don't know the color of and beneath them is a blue block." So the unknown block is between the 3 black and the blue. Then, after removing all blocks, shuffling with an additional green block, and putting them back, the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

Wait, but the original blocks didn't have a yellow one, so maybe the unknown block is now yellow? Or perhaps the yellow block is the new one added. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, the problem says we add one additional green block, so the total blocks after adding are 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue, and 1 green. So that's 6 blocks. Then, when restacked, the yellow block is on top of the blue. But where did the yellow come from? Unless the unknown block is yellow. Maybe the unknown block is yellow, and after shuffling, it's placed on top of the blue block.

Wait, but the problem says the yellow block is on top of the blue block. So perhaps the unknown block is yellow, and in the new stack, it's placed above the blue one. But that doesn't make sense because the blue was originally at the bottom. Alternatively, maybe the unknown block is green, but no, the green is added later.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to visualize.

Original stack (from top to bottom):
1. Black
2. Black
3. Black
4. Unknown (let's call it X)
5. Blue

After removing all, we add a green block, so now we have 6 blocks: 3 black, X, blue, green.

We shuffle them and restack. Now, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. Wait, but we didn't have a yellow block before. So maybe the unknown block X is yellow. So after shuffling, the stack has yellow (X) on top of blue.

But the question is asking for the color of the unknown block, which is X. So if in the new stack, yellow is on top of blue, then X must be yellow.

Wait, but the problem says we added a green block, not a yellow one. So perhaps the unknown block was yellow all along, and after shuffling, it's placed above the blue block.

Alternatively, maybe the yellow block is the new one, but that doesn't make sense because we only added green. So perhaps the unknown block is yellow, and after shuffling, it's placed above blue.

So the answer would be yellow.

Wait, but the problem says we added a green block, so the blocks are 3 black, X, blue, and green. So when restacked, the yellow is on top of blue. Therefore, X must be yellow because that's the only way yellow is in the stack.

So the unknown block is yellow.

The unknown block is yellow.
