There is a library that does not exist.

It has no address, no catalog, no librarian—only an endless corridor of shelves that curve into themselves like a Möbius strip made of paper and memory. The books have no titles, only numbers—each one a unique, unrepeatable sequence of digits that never loops, never repeats, never ends.

They say the library was built by a civilization that outlived time. Not by living forever—but by realizing that infinity is not a number, not even a concept. It is a *habit*. A rhythm the universe hums when no one is listening.

The books are written in a language that changes with the reader. To a child, they are stories of dragons and stars. To a grieving parent, they are letters from lost children, written in handwriting that matches their own. To a mathematician, they are proofs—each page a theorem that resolves a paradox, only to birth three more. The books are self-correcting. They remember every reader who ever turned a page.

No one knows who wrote them. Some say they were scribed by the silence between heartbeats. Others believe they are the dreams of a universe that woke up one day and realized it was infinite—and so it began to write itself, over and over, in every possible voice.

There is no end to the library. But there is a rule: you may only read one book.

Not because the shelves are full. But because the moment you finish reading, you become part of the book.

Not as a character.

Not as a footnote.

But as the ink.

The paper.

The silence between the words.

And when someone else comes—curious, trembling, desperate to know—they will find your name in the margin of a book they’ve never read before.

And you will whisper to them, not in words, but in the weight of the page:

*“Read slowly. You’re not the first. And you won’t be the last.”*

And somewhere, in a corridor that has no beginning and no end, another hand reaches for a book.

And the library breathes.

Again.

And again.

And again.

*Ad infinitum.* [end of text]
