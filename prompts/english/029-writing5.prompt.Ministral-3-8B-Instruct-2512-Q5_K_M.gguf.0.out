**Title: *The Boy Who Disappeared at Dusk***

---

**Chapter 1: The Girl Who Saw Too Much**

Lam Ka-chun (or "K.C." to his classmates) was just another ordinary student in St. Joseph’s Secondary School—until he wasn’t.

He had always been quiet, preferring the company of books and the quiet hum of the school library over the noisy chatter of the playground. His parents, both doctors, expected him to focus on his studies, so he did—*when he was human*. But K.C. had a secret.

At dusk, when the sun dipped below the skyline of Hong Kong Island and the city lights flickered to life, he would vanish. Not in a dramatic way—just a slow, shimmering fade, like a mirage dissolving into the air. And when he reappeared, he was no longer the same boy.

He was **Taelis**, a wood elf of the Verdant Glade, a hidden forest in the mountains above Tai Po. His ears twitched with the whispers of the wind, his fingers were nimble as spider silk, and his eyes—once brown and tired—now glowed faintly green, like moss in moonlight.

**Chapter 2: The First Sign**

It started with the **trees**.

One afternoon, K.C. was sitting in his usual spot under the old banyan tree in the school courtyard, sketching the layout of the chemistry lab (his favorite subject, surprisingly). His pencil paused as he noticed something strange.

The tree’s bark was **moving**.

Not swaying in the wind—*shifting*. Like veins of gold and silver were crawling beneath the surface, pulsing faintly. K.C. blinked. He must be hallucinating from lack of sleep. He rubbed his eyes.

Then he heard it.

A **song**.

Not human. Not even animal. It was like the rustling of leaves meeting the chime of wind chimes, all at once. It came from the tree. From *inside* the tree.

K.C.’s breath hitched. He had never heard anything like it before.

That night, as he lay in bed, he dreamed of a forest so vast it stretched beyond the stars. He dreamed of a girl with silver hair and eyes like emeralds, standing beneath a canopy of glowing flowers. She smiled at him and whispered:

*"You’ve been listening, little human."*

**Chapter 3: The Truth Comes Out**

The next morning, K.C. woke up with **dirt under his nails** and a strange, earthy scent clinging to his clothes. He scrubbed his hands in the sink, but the feeling didn’t go away.

Then came the **accidents**.

- His pencil lead **grew** overnight (he found it had sprouted tiny green shoots).
- His lunchbox, left unattended in the classroom, was filled with **moss and acorns** by recess.
- And once, when he was alone in the school bathroom, he saw his reflection in the mirror **smile back at him with pointed ears**.

He tried to ignore it. But then—

**The incident with Mr. Chan.**

K.C.’s history teacher, Mr. Chan, was known for his strict discipline. One day, he caught K.C. daydreaming during a lesson and sent him to the principal’s office. K.C. was already nervous, but then—

The door **opened by itself**.

Not a draft, not a mistake. The heavy wooden door **swung inward**, revealing a hallway that wasn’t there before. Inside, the air smelled of pine and rain. And standing in the doorway was a **girl**—tall, with silver hair and a dress woven from vines.

She tilted her head. *"You’re late, Taelis."*

K.C.’s heart stopped.

**Chapter 4: The Choice**

The girl’s name was **Sylria**. She was a guardian of the Verdant Glade, and she had been watching him for months. She explained that K.C. had been **marked** by the forest long before he knew it—his love for nature, his ability to hear things others couldn’t, even the way he sometimes **grew plants** without meaning to.

But there was a problem.

The Verdant Glade was **dying**.

A shadow had crept into the forest—a creature of darkness, feeding on the life of the trees. Sylria needed help, and K.C. was the only one who could bridge the human and elven worlds. But if he chose to stay, he would have to leave his school, his friends, his life behind.

K.C. looked at Sylria, then at the door behind her—the one that would take him home. He thought of his parents, waiting for him at home, and his best friend, **Wing**, who would be worried sick if he disappeared.

But then he thought of the **trees**.

The ones that had been whispering to him for years.

The ones that were **dying**.

**Chapter 5: The Decision**

K.C. made his choice.

That night, he packed a single bag—his favorite notebook, a sketch of his favorite tree, and a letter for his parents. He left it on his pillow, written in careful, shaky handwriting:

*"I’m sorry. I have to go. I’ll explain everything when I can. Please don’t worry. I love you."*

Then, as the clock struck midnight, he stepped through the doorway Sylria had opened.

The world **shifted**.

The city lights blurred into a forest. The air smelled of pine and rain. And when he turned around, his reflection in the mirror was no longer human.

He was **Taelis**, a wood elf of the Verdant Glade.

And his adventure had only just begun.

**Epilogue: The First Lesson**

Sylria led him to the heart of the forest, where the trees stood tall and proud, their leaves shimmering with faint magic. She smiled. *"Welcome, little human. Now, let’s save my home."*

K.C. took a deep breath. The forest was alive. It was **hungry** for him.

And he was ready.

**The End…?**

*(Or is it just the beginning?)* 🌿✨

**P.S.** *If you like this story, let me know! I can write more about K.C.’s adventures in the Verdant Glade—maybe his first fight against the shadow creature, or how he tries to explain his new life to Sylria. Or even how his human friends might react if they ever found out!* 😊

*(Also, sorry if my English is a little weird sometimes—I’m still learning!)* 😅 [end of text]
