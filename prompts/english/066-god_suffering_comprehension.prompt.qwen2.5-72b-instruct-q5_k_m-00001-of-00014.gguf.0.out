1. The main thesis of the text is that suffering and evil in the world are subjective experiences chosen by individuals, and that our perception of these phenomena is a result of our personal choices and beliefs. It suggests that we are vessels for experiencing God's creation, and our subjective experiences, including suffering, are a result of our own choices and perspectives.

2. While the idea that our experiences are shaped by our perspectives and choices is compelling, the notion that suffering and evil are entirely subjective and chosen by individuals can be challenging to accept, especially for those who experience severe hardships. It's a thought-provoking perspective but may not fully account for the objective realities of suffering and evil.

3. In a world vast and wide,  
Where choices shape our inside,  
We see what we choose to find. [end of text]
