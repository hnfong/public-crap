Consider this scenario:

Alice: Are you eating healthy?
Bob: Yes! Today I ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat.
Alice: Wow! Let me see.
Bob: (sends Alice a photo)
Alice: wtf

---
Question: what happened? What did Bob eat and was it healthy?

Bob ate a very unusual and potentially unhealthy meal! He consumed aged organic milk, tossed over tomato purée, spread on baked whole wheat. 

**It was not healthy.** Aged organic milk is high in fat and cholesterol. Tomato purée is often high in sugar and can be quite processed. The whole wheat bread adds to the overall calorie and carbohydrate load. 

Alice’s reaction – “wtf” – indicates she found the meal incredibly strange and possibly unsettling, suggesting it was a very specific and potentially excessive meal. [end of text]
