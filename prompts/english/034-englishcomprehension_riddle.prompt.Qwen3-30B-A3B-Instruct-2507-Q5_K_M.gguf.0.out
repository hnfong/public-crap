Let’s break down the scenario:

**Bob’s description:**  
> "Today I ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat."

This is a highly unusual and technically incoherent food description. Let’s analyze it step by step:

1. **"Aged organic milk"** – Milk is not typically "aged" like cheese or wine. Aging milk would cause it to sour and curdle, turning into something like yogurt or buttermilk — but not something you'd normally eat "tossed over" a purée. If it's truly aged, it might be spoiled or fermented.

2. **"Tossed over seasoned tomato purée"** – This part sounds like a salad or sauce topping. Tomato purée is common and healthy.

3. **"Spread on baked whole wheat"** – Baked whole wheat (like whole wheat toast or bread) is a healthy base.

So, Bob is describing a dish that sounds like:
- A base of baked whole wheat (healthy),
- With tomato purée (healthy),
- And **aged milk** tossed on top (problematic).

But here’s the key: **"aged milk"** is not a standard food item. If it’s truly aged, it’s likely **soured or spoiled milk**, which is not safe to eat unless intentionally fermented (like in yogurt or kefir). But Bob didn’t say "fermented" — he said "aged," which implies deterioration.

**Alice’s reaction: "wtf"** — this suggests she was shocked, likely because:
- The idea of eating aged milk is gross or alarming.
- The photo probably showed something visually unappetizing — perhaps curdled, lumpy, or discolored milk on toast.

### What did Bob eat?
Bob likely ate **soured or spoiled milk** (possibly curdled) poured or tossed over tomato purée on whole wheat bread. It’s not a real dish — it’s a bizarre, possibly unsafe, food combination.

---

### Was it healthy?
**No, not really.**  
- **Tomato purée** and **baked whole wheat** are healthy.
- But **aged milk** (if not intentionally fermented) is **not safe to consume** and can cause food poisoning.
- Even if it’s fermented (like yogurt), calling it "aged milk" is misleading and not standard.

---

### Conclusion:
Bob likely ate **spoiled milk** (or curdled milk) on toast with tomato purée — a dangerous and unappetizing combination.  
Alice said "wtf" because it looked gross or unsafe.  
**It was not healthy — and potentially dangerous.**

> ✅ **Lesson:** Don’t eat aged milk unless it’s intentionally fermented (like yogurt or kefir). Otherwise, it’s spoiled and should be thrown out. [end of text]
