Let's break down Bob's description and the reaction to figure out what happened.

### Bob's Description:
- **"aged organic milk"**: Aged milk is often cheese (especially if it's solid). Organic milk suggests it's from organic farming practices.
- **"seasoned tomato purée"**: This could be a sauce, like marinara or ketchup, depending on the seasoning.
- **"baked whole wheat"**: This likely refers to bread or a crust made from whole wheat.

### Putting It Together:
Bob is describing a **pizza** in a fancy way:
- "Aged organic milk" = cheese (likely mozzarella or another pizza cheese).
- "Seasoned tomato purée" = tomato sauce (possibly with herbs like oregano or basil).
- "Baked whole wheat" = whole wheat pizza crust.

### Alice's Reaction:
- At first, Alice is impressed because Bob's description sounds like a very healthy, gourmet meal.
- When she sees the photo, she realizes it's just a pizza (which is often considered less healthy due to high calories, processed ingredients, or excess cheese/oil). Hence her "wtf" reaction.

### Was It Healthy?
- It depends on the specifics, but generally:
  - **Healthy aspects**: Organic ingredients, whole wheat crust, and tomato purée (if low in sugar/salt) can be nutritious.
  - **Less healthy aspects**: Pizza is often high in refined carbs, sodium, and saturated fat (depending on cheese and toppings). "Aged organic milk" (cheese) can be calorie-dense.

### Conclusion:
Bob ate a pizza but described it in a misleadingly fancy way. While it might have some healthy components, pizza is typically not considered a "healthy" meal in the strictest sense, hence Alice's surprise. [end of text]
