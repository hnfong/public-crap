Okay, here's a breakdown of the issues in the provided text, categorized as requested. I'm focusing on *serious* problems, not minor stylistic quirks.

**I. Grammar & Tense/Agreement Issues (5+ issues)**

1.  **Inconsistent Tense:** The text frequently shifts between present, past, and future tenses without clear justification. For example, "back when tech stocks *were* down last year, I *wondered* whether it *would be* a good idea…" The mix feels jarring and lacks cohesion.
2.  **Subject-Verb Disagreement:**  Phrases like "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough…" are grammatically awkward. "We Trust" is a strange construction, and the pronoun "they" doesn't clearly refer to a singular entity.
3.  **Incorrect Pronoun Usage:** "That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people…" The use of "layoff" as a verb is incorrect; it should be "lay off."
4.  **Misused Articles/Prepositions:** "…before things break down." The phrase "break down" is colloquial and doesn't fit the tone. A more formal phrasing would be "before the situation deteriorates."
5.  **Dangling Modifiers/Unclear References:** "…especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is… in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses…" The connection between being geographically misplaced and having useless expertise is weak and unclear.
6.  **Incorrect Word Choice:** "…salary to be monotonic-increasing." While technically correct, "monotonic-increasing" is overly formal and sounds unnatural in this context. "Consistently increasing" would be better.

**II. Serious Stylistic Issues (5+ issues)**

1.  **Excessive Colloquialism/Informality:** The text is riddled with slang ("shitty," "golden goose," "fun ride") and contractions ("gonna," "can't"). This undermines any pretense of serious analysis.
2.  **Overuse of Parenthetical Remarks:** The text is choked with parenthetical asides ("…(GOOG mainly)…," "…(as a whole)…"). These interrupt the flow and make the writing feel cluttered.
3.  **Rambling Structure:** The text lacks a clear thesis or argument. It jumps between observations about tech layoffs, personal financial anxieties, and cynical predictions about the future without a unifying thread.
4.  **Tone Inconsistency:** The tone swings wildly between detached cynicism, self-deprecating humor, and almost conspiratorial speculation. This makes it difficult to take the author's points seriously.
5.  **Unnecessary Jargon/Buzzwords:** The use of terms like "product enshittification" and "True Abundance" feels forced and pretentious. They don't add substance and come across as performative.
6.  **Overreliance on Rhetorical Questions:** The text poses rhetorical questions ("Those who read history knows…") that don't actually engage with the reader or advance the argument.
7.  **Unprofessional Tone:** The entire piece reads like a rant rather than a reasoned analysis. The casual language and personal anecdotes make it unsuitable for any serious discussion.

**III. Other Problems (5+ issues)**

1.  **Logical Fallacies:** The argument that layoffs are inevitable because "the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over" is a deterministic fallacy. It assumes that capitalism operates without human agency or regulatory constraints.
2.  **Unsubstantiated Claims:** The assertion that "people who know approximately how much I make…" is based on an unspecified assumption about how easily salary information is accessible.
3.  **Self-Contradiction:** The author admits to ideological concerns about enabling predatory capitalism but then concedes that "the logic is solid." This undermines their own moral stance.
4.  **Poor Use of Evidence:** The reference to McKinsey Pichai's layoffs is anecdotal and doesn't constitute systematic evidence of a broader trend.
5.  **Lack of Nuance:** The text presents a simplistic view of tech companies as monolithic entities driven solely by profit. It ignores the diversity of motivations and internal conflicts within these organizations.
6.  **Unclear Audience:** The writing style suggests a casual, insider audience, but the content attempts to address broader economic and political issues. This mismatch creates confusion.
7.  **Over-reliance on Personal Anecdote:** The author's personal financial anxieties and career insecurities are irrelevant to the broader argument about tech layoffs and capitalist exploitation.



In short, the text is a disorganized, tonally inconsistent, and logically flawed rant that relies heavily on colloquialisms and unsubstantiated claims. It reads like a stream of consciousness rather than a coherent analysis. [end of text]
