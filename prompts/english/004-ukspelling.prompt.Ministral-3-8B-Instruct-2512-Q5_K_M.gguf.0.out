**The Secret Rainbow by the River**

Lily loved the little river that ran behind her grandma’s cottage. It sparkled in the sun, and sometimes, when the rain stopped just right, a rainbow would appear.

One afternoon, as she skipped along the bank, she saw it—a *proper* rainbow, wide and bright, stretching from one side of the sky to the other. It wasn’t just a little arc; it was a *double rainbow*, with a fainter one inside the first.

“Ooh!” she gasped. “That’s the best one yet!”

Her grandma, drying her hands on her apron, smiled. “Aye, that’s a proper one. Some say it’s magic.”

Lily grinned. “I know! It’s the river’s secret.”

She reached out, but the rainbow shimmered and slipped away, just beyond her fingertips. Still, she felt warm inside, like the sun had kissed her cheek.

“Maybe,” said her grandma, “it’s not for touching. It’s for *seeing*.”

And so, Lily stood there, watching the colours dance—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet—until the rainbow faded into the clouds. But she knew it would be back. Rainbows always were. [end of text]
