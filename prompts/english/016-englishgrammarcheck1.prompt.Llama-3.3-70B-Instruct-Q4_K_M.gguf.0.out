So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

Here are the issues found in the text:

**Grammar Mistakes:**

1. "So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..." should be "So there's a running story that Andreessen Horowitz is basically saying..." (verb tense consistency)
2. "who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking" should be "whom I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking" (subject-verb agreement)
3. "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic" should be "My analysis back then was exactly in line with the same logic" (preposition usage)
4. "it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies" should be "it seems their monopolies are still functional, and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from them" (pronoun reference)
5. "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations" should be "I had no doubt that they could cut costs by almost half without really affecting day-to-day operations" (verb tense consistency)
6. "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose" should be "In America, we trust that they're capitalist enough not to kill their golden goose" (phrase structure and punctuation)
7. "tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift" should be "tech companies can fail really fast once there is a paradigm shift" (adverb usage)
8. "Those who read history knows" should be "Those who read history know" (subject-verb agreement)
9. "Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance" should be "Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets is not true abundance" (capitalization)
10. "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years" should be "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation of what their careers would look like in, say, 20 years" (preposition usage and punctuation)

**Serious Stylistic Issues:**

1. The text jumps abruptly from discussing Andreessen Horowitz's comments to the author's personal investment considerations.
2. The use of colloquial expressions like "I'm sure" and "it seems" can make the text seem informal and unprofessional.
3. The text assumes a high level of background knowledge about the tech industry and its trends, which may not be familiar to all readers.
4. The author's tone can come across as overly cynical and pessimistic, which may alienate some readers.
5. The text uses overly complex sentence structures, which can make it difficult to follow.
6. The author's use of sarcasm and irony (e.g. "McKinsey Pichai") may not be immediately clear to all readers.
7. The text lacks clear transitions between paragraphs, which can make it seem disjointed.
8. The author's personal anecdotes and asides (e.g. "People who know approximately how much I make...") can feel like non-sequiturs and disrupt the flow of the text.
9. The text uses overly technical terms like "antitrust" and "monopolies" without explanation, which may be unfamiliar to non-expert readers.
10. The author's conclusion ("it's been a fun ride") feels abrupt and unsatisfying, and doesn't provide a clear summary of the main points.

**Other Problems:**

1. The text lacks a clear thesis statement or main argument, which can make it difficult to follow.
2. The author's use of rhetorical questions (e.g. "I mean, people who know approximately how much I make...") can feel like a device to avoid making a clear point.
3. The text relies heavily on assumptions about the reader's knowledge and perspective, which may not be accurate.
4. The author's use of hyperbole (e.g. "tech companies can fail REALLY fast") can be off-putting and undermine the text's credibility.
5. The text lacks concrete evidence or data to support the author's claims, which can make it seem like opinion rather than analysis.
6. The author's tone can come across as overly fatalistic and defeatist, which may not be inspiring or motivating to readers.
7. The text lacks a clear call to action or recommendation, which can leave readers feeling unsatisfied.
8. The author's use of jargon and technical terms (e.g. "FI", "levels.fyi") can be alienating to non-expert readers.
9. The text assumes a high level of familiarity with the author's personal circumstances and background, which may not be clear to all readers.
10. The text lacks a clear structure or organization, which can make it difficult to follow and understand. [end of text]
