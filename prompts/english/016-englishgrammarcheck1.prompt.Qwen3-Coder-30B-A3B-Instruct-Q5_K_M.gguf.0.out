**Grammar Issues:**

• **Subject-verb agreement**: "it seems their monopolies are still functional" should be "it seems their monopolies are still functional" (correct, but "it seems" should be "they seem" for better clarity)

• **Tense consistency**: "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs" - should be "I had no ounce of doubt that they could cut costs" (past tense consistency)

• **Pronoun agreement**: "they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down" - should be "they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down" (no issue here, but "things break down" should be "things break down" - no issue)

• **Article usage**: "the free money is draining away" - should be "free money is draining away" (unnecessary article)

• **Verb form consistency**: "they can always layoff more people" - should be "they can always lay off more people" (compound verb)

**Stylistic Issues:**

• **Inconsistent capitalization**: "In America We Trust" should be "In America, we trust" or "In America We Trust" (proper capitalization)

• **Redundancy**: "the party's gonna end sooner or later" - redundant with "the party's gonna end" already conveying the same meaning

• **Unclear pronoun reference**: "it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit" - unclear what "it" refers to

• **Awkward phrasing**: "the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial 'efficiency'" - awkward construction

• **Inconsistent tone**: Mixing casual "gonna" with formal "financial efficiency" creates tonal inconsistency

**Other Problems:**

• **Missing punctuation**: "GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs" lacks proper punctuation

• **Unclear reference**: "McKinsey Pichai" - unclear if this refers to a person or company

• **Inconsistent terminology**: "tech companies can fail REALLY fast" - inconsistent with "tech companies can fail quickly" (capitalization issue)

• **Missing comma**: "the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone" - should be "the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone" (missing comma after "gone")

• **Unclear reference**: "the party's gonna end sooner or later" - unclear what "party" refers to in context [end of text]
