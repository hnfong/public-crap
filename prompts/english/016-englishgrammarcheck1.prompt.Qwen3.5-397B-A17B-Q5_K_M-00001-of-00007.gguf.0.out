Here is a review of the text focusing on grammar (tense/agreement), serious stylistic issues, and other significant problems, adhering to your constraint to ignore minor stylistic or sentence structure nuances.

### Grammar Mistakes (Tense, Agreement, and Syntax)

1.  **Article Missing:** In the phrase "seem to an unwarranted assault," the indefinite article "an" is incorrectly placed or missing a preceding verb. It should read "seem **like** an unwarranted assault" or "seem **to be** an unwarranted assault."
2.  **Subject-Verb Agreement:** The sentence "Those who read history **knows**" contains an agreement error. The subject "Those" is plural, so the verb must be plural: "Those who read history **know**."
3.  **Word Choice/Error:** The phrase "goes through this **phrase**" is incorrect. The context requires the word "phase" (a stage in a process), not "phrase" (a group of words).
4.  **Missing Preposition:** In the clause "expectation what their careers would look like," the preposition "of" is required after "expectation." It should read "expectation **of** what their careers..."
5.  **Tense/Modal Consistency:** The sentence "I had no ounce of doubt that they **can** cut costs" mixes past tense ("had") with present tense modal ("can"). While sometimes acceptable in informal speech, strictly speaking, it should maintain sequence of tenses: "I had no doubt that they **could** cut costs."
6.  **Pronoun/Antecedent Ambiguity:** In the sentence "...before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like," the shift from plural "companies" to singular "GOOG" is slightly jarring grammatically within the parenthetical flow, though the primary issue is the sudden narrowing of scope without a clear transition. (Note: This borders on style, but the lack of agreement in number between the setup "companies" and the specific example "GOOG" creates a syntactic friction).

### Serious Stylistic Issues

1.  **Inappropriate Tone/Register:** The nickname "**McKinsey Pichai**" is highly informal and pejorative. While it conveys a specific sentiment, using a consulting-firm-derived nickname for a CEO in an analytical piece undermines the objective tone established elsewhere and reads more like a social media rant than a reasoned argument.
2.  **Colloquialism vs. Analysis Clash:** The use of "**great/shitty**" creates a jarring tonal inconsistency. The surrounding text discusses "monopolies," "equilibrium," and "paradigm shifts." Using "shitty" trivializes the economic argument; a term like "precarious," "undesirable," or "low-quality" would maintain the analytical weight.
3.  **Overuse of Parenthetical Asides:** The text relies excessively on parentheses to contain entire thoughts, qualifications, or sarcastic comments (e.g., "(who I'm sure...)", "(and particularly GOOG)", "(as a whole)", "(i.e. these jobs...)", "(there's actually no tech jobs here)"). This fragments the narrative flow and forces the reader to constantly jump in and out of the main argument, making the logic harder to follow.
4.  **Inconsistent Capitalization for Effect:** The phrase "**In America We Trust**" uses title case mid-sentence to mimic a slogan. Unless this is a direct quote or a defined proper noun in your context, this stylistic choice looks erratic and distracts from the point about regulatory trust.
5.  **Vague Qualifiers:** Phrases like "**in some funny stack**" and "**we're still sane though**" are too vague and conversational for a text discussing labor markets and capital investment. They weaken the author's credibility by sounding defensive or overly casual about their professional situation.

### Other Problems (Logic, Clarity, and Mechanics)

1.  **Logical Contradiction/Confusion:** The text states, "my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (**we're still sane though**, just unique circumstances)." This is confusing. If the stack is unused by anyone "in their right mind," implying it is irrational to use, the parenthetical claim that "we're still sane" contradicts the premise unless further explained. It muddles the point about employability.
2.  **Ambiguous Reference:** In the sentence "besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech," the comparison is unclear. Is AI smaller than "general tech" in terms of revenue, headcount, or impact? The phrase "operationally much smaller" is imprecise and makes the economic argument regarding "free money draining away" less convincing.
3.  **Run-on Sentence Structure:** The sentence beginning "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG..." is excessively long, containing multiple independent clauses joined by commas and dashes. While you asked to ignore minor structure issues, this specific instance obscures the causal link between the monopoly argument and the layoff argument, making the logic difficult to parse on the first read.
4.  **Cliché Usage:** The phrase "**kill their golden goose**" is a tired cliché. In a piece attempting to analyze specific market dynamics (antitrust, interest rates), relying on such a common idiom reduces the sophistication of the writing.
5.  **Formatting Inconsistency:** The text alternates between using dashes with spaces (" -- ") and standard punctuation. While minor, the inconsistent spacing around the em-dashes (sometimes looking like hyphens with spaces, sometimes acting as breaks) creates a visually messy document that looks unpolished. (e.g., "prices -- in particular" vs "attitude -- but"). [end of text]
