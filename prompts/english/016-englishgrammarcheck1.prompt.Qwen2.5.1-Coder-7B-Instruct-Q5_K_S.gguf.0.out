### Grammar Mistakes
1. **Tense Inconsistency:**
   - "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective." (Present tense "is" vs. past tense "onto")
   - "That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations." (Present tense "can" vs. past tense "had no doubt")
   - "With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech)." (Present perfect "held" vs. past tense "gone")

2. **Agreement Issues:**
   - "META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down." (Subject-verb agreement: "it seems" vs. "their monopolies")
   - "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." (Possessive pronoun "their" vs. singular subject "McKinsey Pichai")

### Stylistic Issues
1. **Repetition:**
   - "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective." (Repetition of "onto something")
   - "That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations." (Repetition of "cut costs")

2. **Lack of Clarity:**
   - "And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective." (Clarity: "unwarranted assault" vs. "capitalist perspective")
   - "With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech)." (Clarity: "free money" vs. "promises of revolutionary tech")

3. **Inconsistent Tone:**
   - "I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later." (Tone: "mean" vs. "obvious")
   - "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing)." (Tone: "reasonable expectation" vs. "monotonic-increasing")

4. **Lack of Coherence:**
   - "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." (Coherence: "McKinsey Pichai" vs. "regard")
   - "With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech)." (Coherence: "free money" vs. "promises of revolutionary tech")

5. **Redundancy:**
   - "I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later." (Redundancy: "mean" vs. "obvious")
   - "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing)." (Redundancy: "reasonable expectation" vs. "monotonic-increasing") [end of text]
