Here are the identified issues, categorized as requested. Only **grammar mistakes (especially tense and agreement)** and **serious stylistic issues** are included—minor stylistic or structural quirks are omitted per instructions.

### **Grammar Mistakes (Tense & Agreement)**  
1. **"Those who read history knows"** → Subject-verb agreement error: *“Those who read history know”* (plural subject requires plural verb).  
2. **"every industry goes through this phrase"** → *“phrase”* is incorrect; should be *“phase”* (spelling/word choice error affecting grammatical correctness in context).  
3. **"I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs..."** → Tense inconsistency: *“had no doubt”* (past) + *“they can cut”* (present). Should be *“they could cut”* to match past narrative frame.  
4. **"People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like..."** → Missing preposition: *“expectation of what”* or *“expectation that their careers would”*.  
5. **"I always knew we're in a state of flux"** → Tense clash: *“knew”* (past) + *“we're”* (present). Should be *“we were in a state of flux”*.

### **Serious Stylistic Issues**  
1. **Inconsistent/unclear pronoun reference**: *“they’re capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether...)"* — The parenthetical shifts abruptly to a third-person analytical tone mid-sentence, breaking rhetorical cohesion.  
2. **Overuse of informal, hyperbolic phrasing in formal analysis**: e.g., *“In America We Trust”* (ironic slogan), *“funny stack”*, *“nobody in their right mind uses”* — undermines credibility in a serious economic/capitalist critique.  
3. **Contradictory framing of ideological stance**: Claims *“the logic is solid”* while earlier calling the underlying attitude *“predatory capitalist”*—fails to reconcile normative judgment with analytical endorsement, creating logical dissonance.  
4. **Unsubstantiated, sweeping generalizations presented as fact**: e.g., *“tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there’s a paradigm shift”* — lacks nuance or evidence; stylistically jarring in analytical prose due to caps and absolutism.  
5. **Shift from personal narrative to macroeconomic assertion without transition**: e.g., *“Saving up for 'FI' isn't an aspiration — it's a survival necessity...”* — abruptly conflates individual experience with systemic claim, risking overgeneralization and weakening argumentative rigor.
