I need to write a short story in UK English, under 200 words, about the rainbows I like the most, using simple words.

Here is my story:

**My Favourite Rainbow**

I like the rainbows that appear after a summer shower. The sun comes out, and suddenly the sky fills with colour.

Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. Seven colours in a big arc across the clouds.

My grandad says a rainbow is a special bridge. He says if you follow it far enough, you might find a pot of gold. I like to pretend I can see it.

The best rainbows are the ones that stay for a long time. You can run outside and look at them properly. You can take a photo or draw a picture.

Sometimes there are double rainbows. That is when you see two arcs, one inside the other. The colours are the same, but the second one is lighter. It looks like the sky is smiling at you.

I like to stand at my window and watch the rain stop. Then I wait for the sun to break through the clouds. And there it is! A rainbow!

It makes me feel happy. It reminds me that after the rain, something beautiful always comes.
