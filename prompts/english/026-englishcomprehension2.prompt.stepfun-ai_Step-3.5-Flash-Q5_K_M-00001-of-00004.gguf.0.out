First, the initial setup: There are 3 black blocks on top of a block that we don't know the color of. Beneath that unknown block, there is a blue block. So, from top to bottom: black, black, black, unknown, blue.

We remove all blocks and shuffle them with one additional green block. So, originally, we have 5 blocks: 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue. Then we add one green block, so now we have 6 blocks in total: 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue, 1 green.

We shuffle these 6 blocks and put them back on top of each other. After shuffling, we have a new order.

The key information given: "The yellow block is on top of blue block." But wait, in the initial setup, there was no yellow block mentioned. We have black, unknown, blue, and then we added green. So where does yellow come from?

I need to read carefully. The question says: "The yellow block is on top of blue block." But in the blocks we have, we have black, unknown, blue, and green. No yellow is mentioned in the list. That seems odd.

Perhaps the unknown block is actually yellow? But the question asks for the color of the block we don't know the color of, so it must be something else.

Let's list all blocks after adding green: we have 3 black blocks, 1 blue block, 1 green block, and 1 unknown block. That's 6 blocks. But then it mentions a yellow block. So, maybe the unknown block is yellow? But if it's yellow, then we know its color, but the question says we don't know the color of that block.

The statement: "The yellow block is on top of blue block." This is after shuffling. So, in the shuffled stack, there is a yellow block that is directly on top of the blue block.

But in our set of blocks, we don't have a yellow block unless the unknown block is yellow. But if the unknown block is yellow, then we know it's yellow, but the question implies we don't know its color initially.

Perhaps I misinterpreted. Let's read the entire question again:

"There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block. We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of blue block.

What color is the block we don't know the color of? Only answer in one word. Don't explain."

So, initially, we have a stack: from top: black, black, black, unknown, blue.

Then we remove all blocks, so we have these 5 blocks: 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue.

We shuffle these with one additional green block, so now we have 6 blocks: 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue, 1 green.

We put them back in a random order.

After putting them back, we observe that "the yellow block is on top of blue block." But we don't have a yellow block in our set. Unless the unknown block is yellow, but then it would be known as yellow, but the question says we don't know its color.

Perhaps the unknown block is not yellow, but there is a yellow block that is one of the black blocks? But black blocks are black, so they can't be yellow.

Maybe I need to consider that the blocks might have multiple colors or something, but that seems unlikely.

Another thought: perhaps "the yellow block" refers to one of the blocks that was originally black? But no, black is black.

Wait, the initial unknown block might be yellow, but we don't know it, so after shuffling, we see that there is a yellow block on top of blue, and since we have only one unknown, it must be that the unknown block is yellow.

But let's see: after shuffling, we have 6 blocks. We know there are 3 black, 1 blue, 1 green, and 1 unknown. But if we see a yellow block on top of blue, then that yellow block must be one of the blocks we have. Since we have no yellow in the known list, the only candidate is the unknown block. So, the unknown block must be yellow.

But then, the question asks for the color of the block we don't know the color of, which would be yellow. But is that consistent?

Let's think about the shuffling. We shuffle all blocks including the unknown. After shuffling, we have a new order. We are told that in this new order, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. But we don't know which block is yellow until we see it. But from our set, we have only one block that could be yellow, which is the unknown one. So, if we see a yellow block, it must be the unknown block, and since it's on top of blue, that means in the shuffled stack, the unknown block (which is yellow) is directly above the blue block.

But the question is: what color is the block we don't know the color of? Initially, we don't know the color of that one block. After the process, we have additional information that there is a yellow block on top of blue. But we already know that the unknown block is part of the set, and if it is yellow, then we know its color now? But the question might be asking based on the initial unknown, but with the new information, we can deduce its color.

The question says: "What color is the block we don't know the color of?" This might be referring to the initial unknown block, and we need to deduce its color from the given information after shuffling.

So, from the information, after shuffling, we see that there is a yellow block on top of blue. Since we have only one block that is not specified as black, blue, or green, that must be the yellow block. Therefore, the unknown block is yellow.

But is there any other possibility? Could one of the black blocks be yellow? No, because they are black blocks, so they are black. Similarly, blue and green are known colors.

So, the unknown block must be yellow.

But let's confirm the count. Initially, we have 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue. After adding green, we have 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue, 1 green. Total 6 blocks. After shuffling, we have a stack. We are told that in this stack, the yellow block is on top of blue block. Since we have no yellow block in the known set, the yellow block must be the unknown block. Therefore, the unknown block is yellow.

So, the answer should be yellow.

But the question says "Only answer in one word." So, I should answer "yellow".

But let's make sure about the phrasing. "The yellow block is on top of blue block." This might imply that there is a block that is yellow, and it is positioned directly above the blue block. But in our deduction, the yellow block is the unknown one, and it is on top of blue in the shuffled stack.

But is it necessarily that the unknown block is yellow? What if the unknown block is not yellow, but one of the black blocks is yellow? But that can't be because they are black blocks. The blocks are distinct by color? The problem says "3 black blocks", so they are black. Similarly, blue and green are specific colors.

So, yes, the only block that could be yellow is the unknown one.

Therefore, the block we don't know the color of is yellow.

So, answer: yellow.
