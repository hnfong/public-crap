**3. A Short Story: The Three Little Pigs and Little Red Riding Hood**  

One sunny morning, the three little pigs—Percy, Pippa, and Peter—were gathering straw, sticks, and bricks to build their new homes. As they worked, they heard a soft voice calling, *"Hello? Is anyone there?"*  

They turned to see Little Red Riding Hood, her red cloak billowing in the breeze. *"Oh, thank goodness!"* she said. *"I’m lost on my way to Grandma’s house. Have you seen a wolf nearby?"*  

The pigs exchanged worried glances. *"A wolf?"* Percy gasped. *"We’ve heard tales of a sly one who blows down houses!"*  

Little Red nodded. *"That’s him! He tricked me and stole my basket of goodies for Grandma."*  

Pippa, the cleverest pig, had an idea. *"Come stay with us! Our brick house is strong. Together, we can outsmart the wolf."*  

So, the four friends huddled inside the sturdy brick home. Soon, they heard a low growl outside. *"Little pigs, little girl… I know you’re in there!"* the wolf snarled. *"Let me in, or I’ll huff and puff and blow your house down!"*  

Peter grinned. *"Not today, Wolf! Why don’t you try climbing down the chimney instead?"*  

The wolf, thinking he’d outwit them, squeezed down the chimney—only to land in a pot of boiling soup the pigs had prepared. *"Ouch!"* he yelped, leaping back outside and running into the woods.  

Little Red cheered. *"You saved me—and Grandma’s treats!"* She shared the remaining cookies, and the pigs laughed. From then on, the four became fast friends, proving that kindness and cleverness could defeat even the sneakiest of foes.  

And so, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood lived happily—and safely—ever after. [end of text]
