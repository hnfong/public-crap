One rainy afternoon, I sat by the window and watched the raindrops dance on the glass. Suddenly, I saw something magical. A rainbow appeared, stretching across the sky like a giant bridge. It was bright and beautiful, with all the colours of the rainbow—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. I ran to my mum and said, "Look at it!"

Mum smiled and said, "Rainbows always appear when the sun shines after the rain. They remind us that even after dark times, something beautiful can come."

I watched the rainbow for a long time. It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I wished I could touch it, but I knew it was just an illusion. Still, I felt happy, knowing that magic was always around, even in the rain.
