**The Last Library**

In the year 2087, when the last human city stood on the edge of a dying planet, there was still one place where the old world lived onâ€”The Last Library.

It was a massive structure built from the bones of ancient computers, its walls lined with crystalline data storage that hummed softly in the dim light. The building itself was a monument to curiosity, a testament to the human need to preserve knowledge even as everything else crumbled.

The librarian, a woman named Zara, had been here for thirty years. She was one of the few remaining humans who could still read, and she spent her days carefully cataloging the last of the old books, the ones that had survived the great silence that had overtaken the world.

She had found a book in the ruins of a school, its pages yellowed and brittle. It was a story about a girl who could speak to the wind, and Zara had read it to herself every evening, feeling the wind whisper back through the cracks in the library's walls.

One day, a young boy appeared at the door, his eyes wide with wonder. He had been scavenging in the ruins, and he had found something that he thought might interest her.

It was a small, glowing device, no bigger than his palm. When he pressed it, a voice came from it, soft and warm, like the sound of rain on leaves.

"Hello, Zara," it said. "I've been waiting for you."

She looked at the boy, then at the device, then back at the book she had been reading. The wind was whispering again, but this time, it was a different kind of whisper.

"Who are you?" she asked.

"I'm the last of the old ones," the voice replied. "I've been waiting for someone to remember what it means to be curious."

Zara smiled, and for the first time in years, she felt something like hope.

The wind whispered again, and this time, it was the sound of a new beginning. [end of text]
