Based on the conversation, it seems that Bob is trying to describe a meal he ate in a somewhat unconventional way. Let's break down what he said:

- "aged organic milk" - This could refer to a type of cheese, like aged cheddar, which is made from milk.
- "tossed over seasoned tomato pur√©e" - This suggests that the cheese (or the milk, if it's actually cheese) is mixed with tomato sauce.
- "spread on baked whole wheat" - This implies that the mixture is then spread on a baked whole wheat product, likely bread or a flatbread.

Putting it all together, Bob's meal seems to be a type of cheese (made from aged organic milk) mixed with tomato sauce and spread on whole wheat bread. This could be a variation of a grilled cheese sandwich with tomato sauce instead of ketchup.

The meal does contain some healthy components, such as whole wheat bread and tomatoes, but the aged organic milk (cheese) might be high in fat and calories. The overall healthiness of the meal would depend on the specific ingredients and portion sizes.

Alice's reaction of "wtf" (what the f***?) suggests that she was surprised or confused by Bob's description of the meal, possibly because it's not a common way to describe a sandwich or because the ingredients seem unusual when put together in that way. 

In summary, Bob's meal seems to be a cheese and tomato sauce sandwich on whole wheat bread, which could be considered somewhat healthy but might not be the most conventional or balanced meal. The confusion stems from Bob's unusual way of describing the meal. [end of text]
