So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

Okay, here’s a detailed review of the text, broken down into grammar, style, and significant issues:

**I. Grammar & Tense Issues**

1.  **Tense Inconsistencies:** The text jumps between past tense (e.g., "when tech stocks were down last year") and present tense (e.g., "it seems their monopolies are still functional"). This creates a choppy flow and disrupts the narrative.
2.  **"Basically" overuse:** The frequent use of "basically" weakens the impact of the assertions. It’s a filler word that doesn’t add much to the argument.
3.  **"I've seen" redundancy:** Phrases like "I've seen" are repetitive and weaken the argument.
4.  **"I had no ounce of doubt"**: This is a slightly awkward phrasing. It’s better to be more direct.
5.  **"In America We Trust"**: This is a slightly awkward phrasing. It’s better to rephrase it to something more natural.

**II. Style & Flow Issues**

6.  **Fragmented Sentences:** The text is full of long, complex sentences. This makes it difficult to follow the argument and can feel rambling.
7.  **Overuse of "And":** The constant use of "and" creates a sense of redundancy and slows down the pace. It’s important to vary sentence structure.
8.  **Repetitive Phrasing:** Phrases like "the logic is solid" and "the only risk is basically" are repeated, making the writing feel monotonous.
9.  **Informal Tone:** While the voice is conversational, it leans towards a slightly informal and perhaps slightly defensive tone.  It could benefit from a more measured approach.
10. **"I mean" overuse:** The frequent use of "I mean" disrupts the flow and can feel like a way to avoid directly stating an opinion.

**III. Significant Issues & Concerns**

11. **Lack of Specificity/Evidence:** The text relies heavily on assertions without providing concrete examples or supporting data. It’s largely an opinionated statement.
12. **Overly Broad Claims:** Statements like "the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over" and "tech companies can fail really fast" are generalizations that lack nuance.
13. **"The party's gonna end sooner or later"**: This is a cliché and doesn't add much to the argument. It feels like a tired observation.
14. **"We're still sane though, just unique circumstances"**: This is a somewhat self-deprecating and slightly awkward way to explain a unique situation. It doesn't fully address the core concerns.
15. **Unclear Connection Between Experiences and Analysis:** The text jumps between personal anecdotes (about his own investing) and broader economic observations without a clear, logical connection. It feels like a collection of observations rather than a cohesive argument.
16. **"In America We Trust"**: This phrase is a bit jarring and doesn't contribute to the overall argument. It feels like a tacked-on statement.

To summarize, the text has a good foundation but needs significant revision to improve its clarity, flow, and argumentative strength. Focusing on conciseness, stronger transitions, and concrete evidence would be beneficial. [end of text]
