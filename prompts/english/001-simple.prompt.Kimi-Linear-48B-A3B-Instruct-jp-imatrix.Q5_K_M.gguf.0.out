3. Write a short a story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.

The three little pigs—Pete, Paul, and Penny—had built their houses of straw, sticks, and bricks, respectively, and were enjoying a peaceful afternoon when they heard a knock at the door.

"Who's there?" Pete called out.

"It's Little Red Riding Hood," came a small voice. "I was on my way to Grandma's house, but I seem to have taken a wrong turn."

The pigs invited her in, and she told them about the big bad wolf she'd encountered. The pigs, remembering their own encounters, offered to help her finish the journey safely.

"Let's walk with you," said Penny. "Three pigs are better than one."

So the four of them set off together. When they reached Grandma's house, they found the wolf already there, disguised as Grandma. But with their combined cleverness and teamwork, they managed to outsmart the wolf and send him running.

From that day on, the pigs and Little Red Riding Hood were the best of friends, and they often met for tea under the shade of the big oak tree, sharing stories of their adventures and the lessons they'd learned.
