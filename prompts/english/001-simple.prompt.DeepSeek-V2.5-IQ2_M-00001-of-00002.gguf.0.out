### 2. Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox ..."; What is the sentence famous for?

This sentence is famous because it contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once, making it a useful tool for testing typewriters and keyboards. It is often used to check the full range of characters and fonts on a device.

### 3. Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.

Once upon a time, in a quaint village nestled between rolling hills and dense forests, there lived three little pigs. These pigs were brothers, each with a unique personality and a penchant for building. The first pig built his house out of straw, the second out of sticks, and the third out of bricks.

One sunny afternoon, as the pigs were tending to their homes, a young girl named Little Red Riding Hood set out on a journey through the forest to visit her grandmother. She carried a basket of freshly baked goodies, her favorite red cloak fluttering in the breeze.

As she walked through the forest, she came across the first little pig's straw house. She knocked on the door, and the pig opened it, curious about the visitor.

"Hello there," said Little Red Riding Hood. "I'm on my way to visit my grandmother. Would you like to share some of these delicious treats?"

The first little pig, always eager for company, invited her in, and they enjoyed the treats together. They chatted about their lives, and Little Red Riding Hood learned about the wolf who had tried to trick her and the challenges the pigs faced.

Feeling inspired by their stories, Little Red Riding Hood continued her journey, eventually meeting the second little pig at his stick house. They too shared stories and treats, and she learned about the clever ways the pigs outsmarted the wolf.

Finally, she arrived at the third little pig's brick house. This pig was the most cautious and had built his house to withstand any threat. They talked about the importance of preparation and resilience.

As Little Red Riding Hood continued her journey, she realized that the stories of the three little pigs had taught her valuable lessons about friendship, resilience, and the importance of being prepared. She arrived at her grandmother's house with a heart full of newfound wisdom and a basket full of stories to share.

And so, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood lived happily ever after, their stories intertwining in the tapestry of their village's history. [end of text]
