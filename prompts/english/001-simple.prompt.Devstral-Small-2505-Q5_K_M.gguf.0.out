1. You would have to count to 100 before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number. The first number that contains the letter "A" is "one hundred."

2. "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." This sentence is famous for being a pangram, which means it contains every letter of the alphabet at least once.

3. Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived three little pigs named Peter, Paul, and Patrick. One day, they decided to build their own houses. Peter built his house with straw, Paul built his with sticks, and Patrick built his with bricks.

One sunny afternoon, while the three little pigs were playing outside, they heard a knock at the door. Standing there was a young girl with a red cloak, known as Little Red Riding Hood. She was on her way to visit her grandmother and had lost her way.

The three little pigs invited Little Red Riding Hood to stay with them until she found her way. They offered her food and a place to rest. In return, Little Red Riding Hood told them a story about her adventure in the forest and the encounter with the Big Bad Wolf.

The three little pigs were fascinated by her story and decided to help her find her way back to her grandmother's house. They all set off together, with the three little pigs protecting Little Red Riding Hood from any danger.

As they walked, they came across the Big Bad Wolf. The wolf, seeing the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood, tried to scare them. But the three little pigs stood their ground and, with the help of Little Red Riding Hood's quick thinking, they outsmarted the wolf and continued on their way.

Finally, they reached Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother's house. The grandmother was overjoyed to see her granddaughter safe and sound. She thanked the three little pigs for their bravery and kindness.

From that day forward, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became the best of friends. They visited each other often, sharing stories and adventures. And they all lived happily ever after. [end of text]
