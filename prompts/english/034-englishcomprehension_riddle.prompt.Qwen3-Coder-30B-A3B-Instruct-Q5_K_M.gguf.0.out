Looking at Bob's description, he ate:

**Aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat**

Breaking this down:
- **Aged organic milk** - This is likely referring to aged cheese (like parmesan or aged cheddar) that's been aged for months or years, which is actually quite healthy due to its probiotics and protein content
- **Seasoned tomato purée** - A healthy, low-calorie sauce
- **Baked whole wheat** - Whole grain bread, which is nutritious

So Bob essentially ate: **Aged cheese (or milk) with seasoned tomato sauce on whole wheat bread**

**Was it healthy?** Yes, this is actually a quite healthy meal:
- Whole wheat provides fiber and nutrients
- Tomato purée is rich in lycopene and vitamins
- Cheese provides protein and calcium
- The preparation method (baked, not fried) keeps it relatively healthy
- No added oils or excessive salt

Alice's "wtf" was likely because she was expecting something more mundane or perhaps she was surprised by the specific combination or the fact that Bob was so enthusiastic about what seemed like a simple, healthy meal. The photo probably showed something that looked more unusual than the description suggested, or maybe it was just a very specific presentation that surprised her. [end of text]
