Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between rolling hills, there lived a boy named Eli. Eli was known for his vivid imagination and a habit of **exaggerating** every story he told. If he caught a fish the size of his hand, he’d say it was as big as a horse. If he felt a little chilly, he’d declare he was freezing solid.

One evening, as the sun dipped behind the mountains, Eli sat on his bed, hugging his favorite **pillow**. He gazed out the window at the fluffy white **clouds** drifting lazily across the sky. He wished he could float up and join them, escaping the worries of the day.

But that night, Eli had a dream. In his dream, he saw a world without love. People hurried past each other without a smile. No one shared their blankets or offered a kind word. The **clouds** in the sky looked heavy and gray, and even the softest **pillow** felt cold and lonely.

Eli wandered through this world, feeling more alone than ever. He realized that without love, even the most comforting things—like a cozy pillow or a gentle cloud—could not bring happiness.

When Eli woke up, he remembered his dream. He decided to be more honest about his feelings and to show love to those around him. He hugged his sister, helped his mother with dinner, and even told his father the truth about the size of the fish he caught that day.

From then on, Eli’s stories were still full of color and wonder, but he never exaggerated the most important things—like the power of love. And as he drifted off to sleep each night, he knew that love was the softest pillow and the fluffiest cloud, making every day brighter. [end of text]
