In the quiet village, after a soft, drizzly rain, the sky would often paint a special picture. My favourite rainbows, they're not just in the sky, but in the smiles of children. They'd laugh, pointing at the arch of colours, from the vivid red, like a brave knight's cloak, to the deep purple, like a queen's royal dress. It's a magical bridge, connecting the earth to the heavens, a promise of beauty after every gloomy day. These rainbows, they remind us of hope, of joy, and of the simple wonders in life.
