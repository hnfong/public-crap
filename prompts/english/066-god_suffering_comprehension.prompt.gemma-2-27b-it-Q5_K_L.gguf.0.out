## Analysis of the Text

**1. Main Thesis:**

The text argues that suffering and evil are not objective realities but rather subjective experiences chosen by individuals. It posits that we, as creations of God, have the agency to shape our realities and experiences, including the perception of suffering.

**2. Agreement:**

While the text presents an intriguing perspective, I find it overly simplistic. While our perception and interpretation of events undoubtedly influence our experience, denying the existence of objective suffering ignores the very real pain and hardship many face due to factors beyond their control.

**3. Poem:**

In God's grand design, all things take flight,
A tapestry woven, both dark and bright.
We choose our threads, the colors we see,
But suffering's touch, can it truly be free?
A phantom perhaps, a mind's own decree,
Or a wound that bleeds, for all eternity?
