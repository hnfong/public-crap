So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

## Grammar Mistakes:

1. **Tense inconsistency:** "So there's a running story..." vs. "And while this might seem..." - The first sentence is present tense, while the second is conditional.
2. **Agreement issue:** "Those who read history knows..." - "Those" is plural, so the verb should be "know."
3. **Tense inconsistency:** "In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year..." vs. "My analysis back then was..." - The first sentence is past tense, while the second is past perfect.
4. **Pronoun ambiguity:** "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." - It's unclear if "their" refers to GOOG or McKinsey Pichai.
5. **Tense inconsistency:** "With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away..." vs. "and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone..." - The first sentence is present tense, while the second is past participle.

## Serious Stylistic Issues:

1. **Overuse of informal language:** "party's gonna end," "shitty," "in some funny stack," "we're still sane though" - This language is too casual for a serious discussion.
2. **Excessive parentheticals:** The text is cluttered with parentheticals, making it difficult to follow the main points.
3. **Lack of clear topic sentences:** Many paragraphs lack clear topic sentences, making it difficult to understand the main idea.
4. **Repetitive sentence structure:** The text relies heavily on simple subject-verb-object sentences, which can become monotonous.
5. **Unclear audience:** The tone and language suggest a casual conversation rather than a formal essay. It's unclear who the intended audience is.

## Other Problems:

1. **Lack of citations:** The text makes several claims about the tech industry without providing any sources.
2. **Overly opinionated:** The text expresses strong opinions without acknowledging alternative perspectives.
3. **Unclear purpose:** The text seems to be a rambling reflection on the tech industry rather than a focused argument.
4. **Potentially offensive language:** The use of terms like "predatory capitalist attitude" and "enshittification" could be considered offensive by some readers.
5. **Unprofessional tone:** The overall tone of the text is unprofessional and lacks objectivity.
