My favourite rainbows are the shy ones. The ones that peek out after a summer shower, when the sun is just starting to shine again.

They're not big and bold, stretching across the whole sky. They're small and delicate, like a secret whispered between the clouds.

Sometimes, they only last a few minutes, a flash of colour before they fade away. But that's what makes them special. They're a reminder that even the smallest things can be beautiful, and that magic can be found in the everyday. 

I love to watch them, imagining tiny fairies dancing on their colourful arches.
