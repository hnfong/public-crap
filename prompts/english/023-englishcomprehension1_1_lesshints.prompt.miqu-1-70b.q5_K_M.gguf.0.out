 Based on the hint about the distinctive writing style and a specific day and month, it seems likely that this passage was written on April 1st, as it has the characteristics of an April Fool's Day joke. The author praises C++ and criticizes Rust in a way that is exaggerated and not typical of serious technical discussions. The mention of the C++ subreddit's sense of humor and the invitation to discuss the article on Hacker News and /r/rust also suggest that this is a lighthearted, humorous piece rather than a serious analysis of the relative merits of Rust and C++. Therefore, my best guess is that this passage was written on April 1st, 2023 or an earlier year. However, without more context, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact year. [end of text]
