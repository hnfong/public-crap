Here are the identified issues in the text, categorized as grammar (tense and agreement), stylistic, and other problems:

### Grammar Issues:
1. **Tense inconsistency**: "I briefly wondered" (past) is followed by "META and GOOG don't seem to be capable" (present), which could be confusing without clear context of when the analysis was made.
2. **Subject-verb agreement**: "Those who read history knows" should be "Those who read history know" (plural subject requires plural verb).
3. **Incorrect preposition**: "on the same line of logic" should be "on the same line of reasoning" or "along the same line of logic" for clarity.
4. **Incorrect verb form**: "we're in a state of flux" should be "we are in a state of flux" for formal consistency (though "we're" is acceptable in informal writing, the surrounding text is more formal).
5. **Incorrect pronoun case**: "as I'm geographically misplaced" should be "as I am geographically misplaced" for consistency in verb tense.

### Stylistic Issues:
1. **Awkward phrasing**: "basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work" is wordy; "saying that people in big tech are not doing enough real work" is more concise.
2. **Informal tone**: "McKinsey Pichai" is overly informal and could be perceived as disrespectful or unprofessional in a formal context.
3. **Redundancy**: "increase margins and profit" is redundant; "increase margins" or "boost profits" would suffice.
4. **Mixed metaphors**: "the party's gonna end sooner or later" is informal and clashes with the more analytical tone of the surrounding text.
5. **Word choice**: "enshittification" is informal and may not be appropriate for all audiences; a more neutral term like "deterioration" could be used.

### Other Problems:
1. **Clarity**: The phrase "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough" is unclear and could be rephrased for better meaning (e.g., "In America, they are capitalist enough to...").
2. **Punctuation**: The parenthetical "(besides small pockets of AI)" is awkwardly placed and could disrupt the flow; it might be better integrated into the sentence.
3. **Capitalization**: "True Abundance" is capitalized inconsistently; it should either be lowercase or consistently capitalized as a proper noun.
4. **Logical inconsistency**: The claim that "tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift" is hyperbolic and lacks supporting evidence, which could weaken the argument.
5. **Tone shift**: The text shifts from analytical to personal ("people who know approximately how much I make") without clear transition, which may confuse the reader. [end of text]
