1. How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?

I would have to count to 10 before I would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number. This is because the English language uses the Latin alphabet, which has 26 letters. The first letter of the alphabet, "A", is the 17th letter in the English language. So, to use the letter "A", I would need to count to 17. [end of text]
