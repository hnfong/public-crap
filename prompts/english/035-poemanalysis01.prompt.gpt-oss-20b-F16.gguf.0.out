<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to respond to the user: "Comment on this: ... Be as thorough as possible." The user posted a short poem or text:

```
inertia of running

makes Mario slip

into the abyss

skill issue
```

They want a thorough comment. So we need to analyze the text, interpret meaning, perhaps discuss the imagery, the structure, the references, the style, the possible context (Mario video game, skill issue, etc.), the use of alliteration, the concept of inertia, slip, abyss, skill issue. We can talk about the poetic devices, the meaning, the possible meta commentary on video games, the concept of skill vs. luck, the idea of "inertia of running" as a metaphor for momentum, the "Mario slip" referencing Mario's slip in the game, the abyss as a metaphor for failure or death, "skill issue" as a meme used in gaming communities. We can also discuss the brevity, the use of lowercase, the lack of punctuation, the line breaks, the rhythm, the possible allusion to "Mario" as a character, the concept of "inertia" as physics, the "skill issue" as a phrase used to blame skill deficiency. We can talk about the interplay between physics and video game mechanics, the concept of momentum in platformers, the idea that Mario's inertia can cause him to slip into pits, the "skill issue" as a meta commentary on the difficulty of the game. We can also talk about the concept of "inertia of running" as a metaphor for the difficulty of stopping or changing direction, the "makes Mario slip" as a metaphor for losing control, the "into the abyss" as a metaphor for failure or death, the "skill issue" as a phrase used to blame the player for failure. We can also talk about the structure: four lines, each line a phrase, no punctuation, all lowercase, the use of enjambment, the rhythm. We can talk about the concept of "inertia" as a physical concept, but also as a metaphor for inertia in life, the "running" as a metaphor for progress, the "slip" as a metaphor for missteps, the "abyss" as a metaphor for the unknown or failure. We can talk about the phrase "skill issue" as a meme used to blame the player for failure, but also as a commentary on the difficulty of the game. We can talk about the interplay between the physical concept of inertia and the video game concept of momentum. We can talk about the concept of "Mario slip" as a reference to the "Mario" video game series, where Mario can slip on certain surfaces or fall into pits. We can talk about the concept of "inertia of running" as a concept in physics: when you run, you have momentum, and you cannot stop instantly. In Mario, the game physics may cause Mario to slip if you don't stop or change direction quickly enough. The "abyss" could refer to the pits in Mario games. The "skill issue" phrase is used in gaming communities to blame the player for failure. The poem could be a commentary on the difficulty of Mario games, or a meta commentary on the "skill issue" meme. The poem could also be a commentary on the concept of "inertia" in life: when you keep running, you may slip into the abyss if you don't pay attention. The "skill issue" could be a meta commentary on the difficulty of controlling your own momentum. The poem could also be a commentary on the concept of "skill" in video games: the phrase "skill issue" is used to blame the player for failure, but the poem suggests that the failure is due to the physics of the game, not the player's skill. The poem could also be a commentary on the concept of "inertia" as a metaphor for the difficulty of stopping or changing direction in life. The poem could also be a commentary on the concept of "skill" as a concept that is often used to blame the player for failure. The poem could also be a commentary on the concept of "skill" as a concept that is often used to blame the player for failure. The poem could also be a commentary on the concept of "skill" as a concept that is often used to blame the player. The poem could also be a commentary on the concept of "skill" as a concept that is often used to blame the player for failure. The poem could also be a commentary on the concept of "skill" as a concept that is often used to blame the player for failure.

We need to produce a thorough commentary. We can structure the answer: introduction, analysis of each line, overall structure, poetic devices, meaning, references, meta commentary, possible interpretations, conclusion. We can also mention the concept of "inertia" in physics, "Mario slip" referencing Mario's physics, "abyss" as a metaphor for failure, "skill issue" as a meme. We can talk about the interplay between physics and video game design, the concept of momentum, the difficulty of controlling a character, the frustration of falling into pits, the meta commentary on blaming skill. We can talk about the brevity and the use of all lowercase, the lack of punctuation, the line breaks, the rhythm. We can talk about the concept of "inertia" as a metaphor for life, the concept of "running" as progress, the concept of "slip" as misstep, the concept of "abyss" as unknown or failure, the concept of "skill issue" as a meme. We can talk about the concept of "skill issue" as a phrase used to blame the player for failure, but the poem suggests that the failure is due to the physics of the game.
