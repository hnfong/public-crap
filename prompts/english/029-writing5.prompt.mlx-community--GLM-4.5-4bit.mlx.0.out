# The Secret Life of a Wood Elf Student

My name is Leo, and I am 16 years old. I go to Hong Kong International School like normal teenager, but I have big secret - I am actually wood elf from ancient forest. My parents moved to city when I was baby, and they told me never tell anyone about our true identity.

Every morning, I wake up very early because I need much less sleep than human classmates. While my family still sleeping, I go to rooftop of our apartment building. I feel most alive when I can touch plants and feel morning breeze. Sometimes I talk to the potted plants - they don't talk back like in elf stories, but I think they understand me.

At school, I have to be very careful. In PE class, I always pretend to be slower than I really am. If I run as fast as I can, everyone would know something wrong with me. One time, Jason from class 3B saw me climbing the tree in school garden during lunch break. I was so scared! But he just said "Wow, you good at climbing" and walked away. I was relief.

The hardest part is when teacher talk about environment. Last month, Mr. Chan showed us video about forest cutting in Amazon. I felt so sad and angry that my eyes started glowing green - that happens when wood elf have strong emotions. I quickly put on sunglasses and pretend I have headache. Nobody notice, I think.

My best friend Amy doesn't know my secret. She always say I am "good with plants" because our class project about growing vegetables won first prize. Truth is, I just sing to them softly when nobody watching. They grow much better that way.

Sometimes I miss the forest where my family come from. My parents say we can't go back because it's not safe for elves anymore. But I dream about tall trees and clean air. In city, everything so loud and fast.

Yesterday, something strange happened. New student come to our class. Her name is Luna, and when she look at me, I feel like she know something. After class, she come to me and say quietly, "Your ears... they little bit pointy, right?"

I was so shock! I didn't know what to say. Then she smile and show me her ears - they pointy too!

"I am water elf," she whisper. "My family live by the ocean."

For first time since I come to this school, I don't feel alone. Maybe having friend who understand me won't be so bad after all.
