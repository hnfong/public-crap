I love rainbows the most. They appear after the rain, when the sun comes out. The sky is blue, and the air smells fresh. The raindrops fall, and then the sun shines through the clouds. The light splits into colours — red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. They look like a bridge in the sky, connecting the earth to the clouds.

I like to watch them from my garden. Sometimes, I sit on my swing and look up. The rainbow is so bright, it makes me smile. I imagine it’s a rainbow bridge to a magical land. Maybe there are fairies and dragons there, and they ride on rainbows.

One day, I saw a rainbow that was double. It was like two bridges in the sky. I ran to tell my mum. She said it was a special rainbow, and that it only happens when the sun is just right.

Rainbows make me feel happy. They remind me that even after the rain, there is beauty. I like to draw them, too. I use crayons and make sure each colour is bright and clear.

Rainbows are like a gift from the sky. I love them more than anything. [end of text]
