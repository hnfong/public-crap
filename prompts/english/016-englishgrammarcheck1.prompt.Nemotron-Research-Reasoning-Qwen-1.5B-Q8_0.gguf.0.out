Alright, I need to review this text and point out grammar mistakes, tense issues, and stylistic problems. The user wants me to identify at least 5 issues in each category without minor issues. Let me go through the text step by step.

First, I'll read through the text carefully.

The text is about Andreessen Horowitz and his arguments about tech companies not doing enough real work. It has several sentences.

Looking for grammar mistakes:

1. "So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying..." – "running" is past tense, but "there's" is present. Maybe not a mistake but a mix. Maybe not a tense issue but a mix.

2. "people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..." – "justify" is past tense, but "do" is present. Maybe not a mistake.

3. "While this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers..." – "unwarranted" is past tense, "attack" is past. Maybe not.

4. "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something..." – "onto" is past tense, "is onto" is present. So "onto" is past, "is onto" is present. So "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something" – "something" is present, "onto" is past. So maybe "onto" is incorrect tense.

5. "In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year..." – "when" is past, "down" is past. So correct tense.

6. "I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices..." – "wondered" is past, "buy" is present continuous. So past vs present. Maybe not a mistake.

7. "In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year..." – same as above.

8. "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic..." – "exactly" is correct.

9. "While META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable..." – "aren't" is past perfect? Or "don't" is present. Maybe "aren't" is correct.

10. "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations." – "no ounce" is past, "no" is present. So past vs present. Maybe not.

11. "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs..." – "their" is present, "their (GOOG mainly)" is past participle? Maybe not.

12. "McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." – "is ready" is present, "ready to do whatever pleases" is past. So past vs present. Maybe not.

13. "In the end I didn't make any trades..." – "didn't make" is past continuous, "made" is present continuous. So past vs present. Maybe not.

14. "If only because I would have hated how I participated..." – "hated" is past continuous, "hated how I participated" is past continuous. So correct tense.

15. "But ideological concerns aside..." – "aside" is present participle? Or "aside" is present. Maybe not.

16. "The logic is solid." – "is solid" is past continuous, "is solid" is correct.

17. "The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but..." – "is basically" is past continuous, "are basically" is present participle. So "are basically" is correct.

18. "But In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." – "they're" is present, "their" is present. So correct.

19. "There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough..." – "are" is present, "remain" is present. So correct.

20. "I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years..." – "will be" is present continuous, "say" is present. So correct.

21. "Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another." – "knows" is present, "goes through" is present continuous. So correct.

22. "Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance." – "isn't" is present, "isn't True" is present. So correct.

23. "That said, it has been a fun ride." – "has been" is past continuous, "fun" is present. So past vs present. Maybe not.

24. "I mean, people who know approximately how much I make..." – "know" is present, "make" is present. So correct.

25. "by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later." – "by referencing" is past continuous, "by" is present. So past vs present. Maybe not.

26. "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing)." – "expect" is present, "monotonic-increasing" is present. So correct.

27. "But I always knew we're in a state of flux." – "state of flux" is present participle. So correct.

28. "Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this
