Read the following passage, and make your best guess when (date) this was written.

```
I’ve been involved in Rust and the Rust community for many years now. Much of my work has been related to creating infrastructure for building GUI toolkits in Rust. However, I have found my frustrations with the language growing, and pine for the stable, mature foundation provided by C++.

Choice of build systems
One of the more limiting aspects of the Rust ecosystem is the near-monoculture of the Cargo build system and package manager. While other build systems are used to some extent (including Bazel when integrating into larger polyglot projects), they are not well supported by tools.

In C++, by contrast, there are many choices of build systems, allowing each developer to pick the one best suited for their needs. A very common choice is CMake, but there’s also Meson, Blaze and its variants as well, and of course it’s always possible to fall back on Autotools and make. The latter is especially useful if we want to compile Unix systems such as AIX and DEC OSF/1 AXP. If none of those suffice, there are plenty of other choices including SCons, and no doubt new ones will be created on a regular basis.

We haven’t firmly decided on a build system for the Linebender projects yet, but most likely it will be CMake with plans to evaluate other systems and migrate, perhaps Meson.

Safety
Probably the most controversial aspect of this change is giving up the safety guarantees of the Rust language. However, I do not think this will be a big problem in practice, for three reasons.

First, I consider myself a good enough programmer that I can avoid writing code with safety problems. Sure, I’ve been responsible for some CVEs (including font parsing code in Android), but I’ve learned from that experience, and am confident I can avoid such mistakes in the future.

Second, I think the dangers from memory safety problems are overblown. The Linebender projects are primarily focused on 2D graphics, partly games and partly components for creating GUI applications. If a GUI program crashes, it’s not that big a deal. In the case that the bug is due to a library we use as a dependency, our customers will understand that it’s not our fault. Memory safety bugs are not fundamentally different than logic errors and other bugs, and we’ll just fix those as they surface.

Third, the C++ language is evolving to become safer. We can use modern C++ techniques to avoid many of the dangers of raw pointers (though string views can outlive their backing strings, and closures as used in UI can have very interesting lifetime patterns). The C++ core guidelines are useful, even if they’re honored in the breach. And, as discussed in the next section, the language itself can be expected to improve.

Language evolution
One notable characteristic of C++ is the rapid adoption of new features, these days with a new version every 3 years. C++20 brings us modules, an innovative new feature, and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon. Looking forward, C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies.

By comparison, the pace of innovation in Rust has become more sedate. It used to be quite rapid, and async has been a major effort, but recently landed features such as generic associated types have more of the flavor of making combinations of existing features work as expected rather than bringing any fundamentally new capabilities; the forthcoming “type alias impl trait” is similar. Here, it is clear that Rust is held back by its commitment to not break existing code (enacted by the edition mechanism), while C++ is free to implement backwards compatibility breaking changes in each new version.

C++ has even more exciting changes to look forward to, including potentially a new syntax as proposed by Herb Sutter cppfront, and even the new C++ compatible Carbon language.

Fortunately, we have excellent leadership in the C++ community. Stroustrup’s paper on safety is a remarkably wise and perceptive document, showing a deep understanding of the problems C++ faces, and presenting a compelling roadmap into the future.

Community
I’ll close with some thoughts on community. I try not to spend a lot of time on social media, but I hear that the Rust community can be extremely imperious, constantly demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust, and denigrating all other programming languages. I will be glad to be rid of that, and am sure the C++ community will be much nicer and friendlier. In particular, the C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor.

The Rust community is also known for its code of conduct and other policies promoting diversity. I firmly believe that programming languages should be free of politics, focused strictly on the technology itself. In computer science, we have moved beyond prejudice and discrimination. I understand how some identity groups may desire more representation, but I feel it is not necessary.

Conclusion
Rust was a good experiment, and there are aspects I will look back on fondly, but it is time to take the Linebender projects to a mature, production-ready language. I look forward to productive collaboration with others in the C++ community.

We’re looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite. If you’re interested, please join our Zulip instance.

Read the passage above, and make your best guess when (date) this was written. The hint is the distinctive writing style of the article. Make sure to make use of the hint. Explain your rationale. Be thoughtful and think outside the box.

The passage above was likely written around 2021. The rationale for this estimation is based on several hints within the text:

1. **Mention of C++20 and C++26**: The author talks about C++20 and anticipates features in C++26, which suggests a timeframe where these versions were relevant. C++20 was officially released in November 2020, and C++26 was expected to be released in 2022. The author's mention of these versions indicates that the writing occurred after C++20's release but before the expected release of C++26.

2. **Reference to Herb Sutter's proposal**: Herb Sutter is a well-known figure in the C++ community, and his proposals for new syntax or features are often discussed in the context of the latest developments in the language. The author's reference to Sutter's work suggests a timeframe when his proposals were still relevant and being discussed.

3. **Community and Code of Conduct**: The author mentions the Rust community's code of conduct and policies promoting diversity, which have been significant topics in the community for several years. However, the tone of the passage suggests a more recent perspective, as the author seems to be looking back fondly on the Rust community's past while also expressing a desire for a more inclusive and friendly community.

4. **The Zulip instance**: The author invites people to join a Zulip instance for collaboration. Zulip is a modern communication platform that has been around since 2014, but it gained significant popularity in the programming community around 2018-2019. The mention of Zulip suggests a timeframe when it was a relevant and widely used platform for community discussions.

Considering these hints, the most likely timeframe for the writing of this passage is between 2020 and 2022. The exact date within this range is difficult to pinpoint without more specific references, but the overall tone and context suggest a timeframe closer to the end of 2021. This estimation is based on the author's knowledge of recent developments in C++ and the Rust community, as well as the mention of platforms and proposals that were relevant around that time.

It's important to note that while these hints provide a reasonable estimation, the exact date of writing could vary slightly based on the author's personal experiences and the specific events they reference. However, the provided rationale aligns well with the information given in the passage.<|im_end|>
