In this scenario, Bob's description of his meal is quite confusing and seems to be a mix of various food items that don't typically go together. Let's break down what he said:

1. **Aged organic milk**: This is milk that has been left to ferment and age, similar to kefir or buttermilk. It's generally healthy due to the probiotics it contains.
2. **Tossed over seasoned tomato purée**: Tomato purée is a healthy base, especially when seasoned, but "tossed over" is an unusual way to describe how it's combined with the milk.
3. **Spread on baked whole wheat**: Whole wheat is healthy, but spreading tomato purée and milk on it is unconventional.

When Alice asks to see the photo and responds with "wtf," it suggests that the actual meal Bob sent a photo of looked quite different from the description, or it was presented in a very unusual or unappetizing way. It's possible that Bob was trying to make a joke or was being sarcastic about his "healthy" meal.

In reality, the combination Bob described doesn't make much sense as a typical meal. A more conventional healthy meal might involve whole wheat toast with tomato purée and a side of milk or yogurt, but not necessarily all combined together in the way Bob described.

So, what Bob ate was likely a bizarre and unappetizing combination of foods, and it's unclear if it was truly healthy due to the unusual preparation. Alice's reaction suggests that the photo revealed something unexpected or humorous. [end of text]
