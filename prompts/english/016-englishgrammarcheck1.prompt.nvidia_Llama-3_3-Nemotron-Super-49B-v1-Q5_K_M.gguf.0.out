Below is the review of the text in the requested format, identifying at least 5 issues in each of the specified categories (Grammar, Stylistic, and Other Problems). Note that some issues could overlap categories, but they've been placed where they seem most relevant.

### **Grammar Mistakes (especially tense and "agreement" issues)**

1. **Tense Inconsistency**: "while this might seem to an unwarranted assault... I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something" - The sentence shifts from present ("might seem") to present continuous ("am agreeing") without clear necessity. Suggested correction: Maintain consistent tense, e.g., "might seem... I agree..."
   
2. **Lack of Agreement**: "the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust)" - The transition between sentences lacks a clear connective, making the agreement between the two statements unclear. Suggested correction: Add a transitional phrase, e.g., "However, the only risk..."
   
3. **Tense Inconsistency**: "I had no ounce of doubt... and as we've seen" - Past ("had") to present perfect ("have seen") without clear temporal justification. Suggested correction: Align tenses, e.g., "I had no doubt... as was seen"
   
4. **Subject-Verb Agreement**: "the promises ... are largely gone" (implied subject-verb, actual: "promises ... is") - Incorrect singular verb for a plural subject. Suggested correction: "...promises ... have largely gone"
   
5. **Tense Inconsistency**: "Those who read history knows" - Incorrect verb form for subject ("know" instead of "knows" for singular, but subject is plural). Suggested correction: "Those who read history know"

### **Serious Stylistic Issues**

1. **Abrupt Tone Shifts**: From analytical to somewhat casual ("...but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid.") without smooth transition. Suggested correction: Use transitional phrases for tone shifts.
   
2. **Overly Informal Language**: Use of colloquial expressions ("enshittification", "gonna") in otherwise formal/analytical text. Suggested correction: Replace with formal equivalents (e.g., "degradation" for "enshittification")
   
3. **Assumed Knowledge**: References without explanation (e.g., "levels.fyi", "McKinsey Pichai") might confuse unfamiliar readers. Suggested correction: Briefly explain or provide context for such references.
   
4. **Sentence Length Variability**: Extreme variations in sentence length can disrupt flow. Suggested correction: Balance short and long sentences for better rhythm.
   
5. **Lack of Clear Structure**: The text jumps between topics (investment analysis, personal financial strategy, industry commentary) without clear sectioning. Suggested correction: Organize into clear sections or topics.

### **Other Problems**

1. **Unclear References**: "McKinsey Pichai" - Assuming this refers to Sundar Pichai (CEO of Alphabet/Google) and implies a strategy akin to McKinsey's consulting approaches, but this is not clear. Suggested correction: Clarify the reference.
   
2. **Speculative Assumptions**: Statements about the future of tech companies ("tech companies can fail REALLY fast") without cited evidence. Suggested correction: Support with examples or data.
   
3. **Personal Anecdote Relevance**: The relevance of the author's personal financial situation and location to the broader argument is unclear. Suggested correction: Clearly link personal anecdotes to the main point or omit if unnecessary.
   
4. **Lack of Concrete Data**: Discussions of stock prices, layoffs, and financial strategies without specific numbers or sources. Suggested correction: Include data or sources to strengthen arguments.
   
5. **Ambiguous Conclusion**: The text ends without a clear conclusion or call to action, leaving the reader without a final thought. Suggested correction: Summarize key points or provide a concluding statement. [end of text]
