I want tell you story about my friend, his name is Elrik. He is very normal student in our school, but actually he is not normal, he is wood elf! 

Every morning, Elrik wake up early, before sunrise, he will go to rooftop of his apartment, feel the wind and sunshine, and do some... how you say... meditation? Yes, meditation. He say it help him connect with nature. I think it very cool, but also very weird.

In school, Elrik very quiet, he sit in back of classroom and listen teacher talk. He very good at listen, and he always do homework on time. But sometimes, he will look out of window, and stare at tree or bird, and I think he want to go out and play with them. 

Elrik love tree, he love plant, he love all thing about nature. He always carry small bag with him, and in bag, he have some seed, some leaf, and some... how you say... herb? Yes, herb. He say it for help him remember who he is.

But Elrik have problem, he have to hide who he is. He say if people know he is wood elf, they will think he is crazy, or monster. So he have to wear... how you say... disguise? Yes, disguise. He wear human clothes, and human shoe, and he try to act like human. But sometimes, he forget, and he will do something... how you say... elf-like? Yes, elf-like. Like, he will climb tree in schoolyard, or he will talk to bird like they are friend.

I am only one who know Elrik secret, and I promise I will not tell anyone. I think it very cool to have wood elf as friend, and I want to help him. So, I will keep his secret, and I will help him be normal human student. But sometimes, I wish I can see him be himself, be wood elf, and run in forest, and play with animal. I think it will be very happy.

Oh, I forget to say, Elrik have one more problem, he have to go back to his... how you say... homeland? Yes, homeland. He say it call Elvendom, and it in another world. He say he have to go back before he turn 18, or he will lose his... how you say... magic? Yes, magic. I think it very sad, because I will miss him, and I don't know how he can go back to his homeland. But I will help him, I promise. [end of text]
