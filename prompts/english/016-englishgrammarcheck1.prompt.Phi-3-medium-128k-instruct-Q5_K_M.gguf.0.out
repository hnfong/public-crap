So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

Please review this text and point out any grammar mistakes (especially tense and "agreement" issues), serious stylistic issues, or other problems. Do not report minor stylistic/sentence structure issues. Output in list/point form. Identify at least 5 issues in each category.
 Grammar Mistakes:
1. "people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..." - The verb "are" should be "is" to agree with the singular subject "story."
2. "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something..." - The contraction "can't" should be "cannot" or "can not" for formal writing.
3. "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half..." - The verb "can" should be "could" to maintain past tense consistency.
4. "McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." - The name "McKinsey Pichai" is incorrect; it should be "Sundar Pichai."
5. "Those who read history knows..." - The verb "knows" should be "know" to agree with the plural subject "those."

Stylistic Issues:
1. The text uses a conversational tone, which may not be suitable for formal writing.
2. The use of contractions ("I'm," "don't," "can't") is informal and should be avoided in formal writing.
3. The text includes slang and colloquial expressions ("the party's gonna end," "fun ride"), which are not appropriate for formal writing.
4. The text lacks clear structure and transitions between ideas, making it difficult to follow.
5. The text uses first-person narrative ("I," "my"), which may not be suitable for formal writing.

Other Problems:
1. The text contains a few spelling errors, such as "enshittification" instead of "product degradation."
2. The text includes a few grammatical errors, such as "people in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like" instead of "people in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation of what their careers would look like."
3. The text includes a few awkward phrasings, such as "the free money is draining away" instead of "the easy money is drying up."
4. The text includes a few unclear or ambiguous phrases, such as "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust)" instead of "the primary risk is regulatory (antitrust)."
5. The text includes a few inconsistent or unclear references, such as "their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023" instead of "Google's first round of layoffs in early 2023."
