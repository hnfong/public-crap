A delightfully ambiguous scenario! Let's break down the possibilities:

**What Bob Ate:**
Based on Bob's description, here are a few interpretations of what he might have eaten:

1. **Healthy Interpretation**: 
   - "Aged organic milk" could be aged cheese (e.g., cheddar, parmesan) made from organic milk.
   - "Seasoned tomato purée" suggests a flavorful, possibly homemade tomato sauce.
   - "Baked whole wheat" could be whole wheat pasta or a whole wheat flatbread/toast.
   - **Healthy Meal**: Aged cheese over tomato sauce on whole wheat pasta or toast. This would indeed be a relatively healthy meal, rich in protein, fiber, and some vitamins.

2. **Less Healthy Interpretation**:
   - "Aged organic milk" might simply mean old organic milk, possibly spoiled.
   - "Seasoned tomato purée" could be a store-bought, high-sodium tomato sauce.
   - "Baked whole wheat" might be whole wheat bread, but if overconsumed, could add extra calories.
   - **Less Healthy Meal**: If Bob used spoiled milk or consumed the dish in large quantities, the healthiness decreases.

3. **The "wtf" Interpretation**:
   - Given Alice's shocked reaction, Bob might have eaten something unexpected or unappetizing.
   - "Aged organic milk" could indeed be spoiled milk.
   - "Seasoned tomato purée" might be a strange, unappetizing concoction.
   - "Baked whole wheat" could be burnt or inedible.
   - **Unhealthy & Unappetizing**: Spoiled milk over a strange tomato mixture on burnt whole wheat. Definitely not healthy and likely inedible.

**Was it Healthy?**
The healthiness of Bob's meal depends on the interpretation:

- **Healthy Interpretation**: Yes, relatively healthy.
- **Less Healthy Interpretation**: Somewhat healthy but could be improved.
- **"wtf" Interpretation**: Definitely not healthy.

Without more context, we can't know for sure. However, given Alice's reaction, the "wtf" interpretation seems most likely, suggesting Bob's meal was neither healthy nor appetizing. [end of text]
