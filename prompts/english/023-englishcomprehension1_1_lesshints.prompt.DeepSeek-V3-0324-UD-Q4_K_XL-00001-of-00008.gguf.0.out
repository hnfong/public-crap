### Step 1: Analyzing the Content for Clues

First, I read through the passage carefully to identify any explicit or implicit references to dates, events, or technological states that could help pinpoint when it was written. Here are the key observations:

1. **C++ Versions Mentioned**: The passage discusses C++20 and looks forward to C++26. This suggests the article was written after C++20 was finalized (December 2020) but before C++26 was finalized (which is expected around 2026). This narrows it down to between 2021 and 2025.

2. **Rust Features**: The passage mentions "generic associated types" (GATs) as a recently landed feature in Rust. GATs were stabilized in Rust 1.65.0, released on November 3, 2022. It also mentions "type alias impl trait" (TAIT) as forthcoming. TAIT was not fully stabilized as of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, but it was being actively worked on. This suggests the article was likely written after November 2022 but before TAIT was fully stabilized (possibly mid-to-late 2023).

3. **Linebender Projects**: The author mentions "Linebender projects," which is associated with Raph Levien, a prominent figure in Rust and GUI development. His blog and projects are well-documented, and this could be cross-referenced for timing.

4. **Build Systems**: The discussion about build systems (Cargo, CMake, Meson) doesn't provide a specific date but reflects ongoing debates in the Rust/C++ communities.

5. **Community and Social Media**: The mention of the Rust community's behavior on social media and the C++ subreddit's humor is a cultural observation that doesn't directly date the article but could align with broader community sentiments in recent years.

6. **Carbon Language**: The mention of Carbon, a new C++-compatible language, is notable. Carbon was announced by Google in July 2022, so the article must have been written after that.

### Step 2: The Hint About "Distinctive Writing Style"

The hint mentions that the "distinctive writing style of the article is connected to one particular day and month of the year." This suggests that the article's tone or content is characteristic of a specific annual event or date. Possible interpretations:

- **April 1st (April Fools' Day)**: Many tech communities publish satirical or parody articles on this day. The tone of this article could be a parody, exaggerating criticisms of Rust and praising C++ in an over-the-top manner.
  
  - The article's arguments are somewhat extreme, such as dismissing memory safety concerns in C++ or claiming that the C++ community is "much nicer and friendlier" (which is subjective and could be ironic).
  - The mention of "DEC OSF/1 AXP" and "AIX" as Unix systems to compile for seems archaic and possibly humorous, as these are very old systems.
  - The claim that "computer science has moved beyond prejudice and discrimination" is overly idealistic and could be satirical.
  - The sudden shift from Rust to C++ for Linebender projects, given Raph Levien's deep involvement in Rust, seems unlikely and could be a joke.

- **Other Dates**: Less likely, as no other dates have a strong association with parody or distinctive writing styles in tech.

### Step 3: Cross-Referencing with External Events

Given the April Fools' hypothesis, I checked if there were any known April Fools' jokes in the Rust or C++ communities around the time frame suggested by the content (late 2022 to mid-2023):

- In April 2023, there were several tech-related April Fools' jokes, including fake announcements and parodies. The tone and content of this article fit well with that tradition.
- The mention of Carbon (announced mid-2022) and C
