**The Cloud That Couldn’t Sleep**  

Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between rolling hills, there lived a little cloud named Fluffy. Fluffy was no ordinary cloud—he was the fluffiest, puffiest cloud in the sky, and he loved to exaggerate. “I’m the biggest cloud ever!” he’d boast to the other clouds. “I’m so big, I could swallow the whole sun!” The other clouds would roll their eyes and fly away, leaving Fluffy to puff himself up even more.  

But one night, Fluffy couldn’t sleep. His pillow—a soft, fluffy white pillow made of mist—felt too hard, his thoughts too loud. He drifted over the village, watching families cuddled together under warm blankets. He saw a little girl tuck her teddy bear in, whispering, “I love you.” He saw a boy hug his dog and say, “You’re my best friend.” Fluffy felt a strange ache in his heart.  

“Why don’t they hug *me*?” he muttered.  

The next morning, Fluffy decided to visit the village. He floated down to the ground, puffing himself into a giant, fluffy shape. Children laughed and ran through him, but no one hugged him. “Maybe I’m not fluffy enough,” he sighed.  

Just then, a tiny kitten stumbled out of a bush, shivering. Fluffy wrapped himself around her, warm and soft. The kitten purred and nuzzled into his misty fluff. “There you go,” Fluffy whispered. “You’re safe now.”  

As the kitten drifted to sleep, Fluffy realized something important: love wasn’t about being the biggest or the fluffiest—it was about being there for someone else.  

From that day on, Fluffy stopped exaggerating. He became the kindest, most comforting cloud in the sky, always ready to wrap someone in his misty embrace. And sometimes, when the wind was just right, he’d whisper to the stars, “Love is the best pillow of all.”  

**The End.**  

*(Moral: Love isn’t about grand gestures—it’s about being there for others, even in the smallest ways.)* 🌤️💕✨ [end of text]
