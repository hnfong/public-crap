# The Secret Wood Elf

My name is Jia‑lam, and I am a high school student in Hong Kong. I look like any other teenager—wearing my uniform, attending class, doing homework. But there is something about me that no one knows: deep inside my heart, I carry the spirit of a wood elf.

It started when I was young. My grandmother used to tell stories about the ancient elves who lived in the forests, beings who could talk to trees and feel the wind through the leaves. I always felt a strange connection to nature, as if the world of plants and soil was whispering secrets just for me.

Now, in the busy corridors of our school, I keep this secret close. When I walk past the hallway, I imagine the sounds of rustling branches. When I sit in class, I think about the quiet strength of roots beneath the ground. My teachers see a diligent student, but sometimes I feel like I'm a bridge between two worlds—the world of textbooks and the world of wild forests.

One day, during a break, I found a small patch of green grass near the schoolyard. The other students walked past it without noticing, but I stopped. I could feel the tiny vibrations of the soil, the memory of a seed that once grew there. I closed my eyes and imagined the elves' gentle hands guiding the growth of each blade of grass. In that moment, I felt both a student and a wood elf.

At night, when I go home, I sit by the window and watch the moon. I think about the elves who watch the moon in their own forests, far away. I wonder if they ever feel the same longing I do, the desire to be part of something larger than just a school schedule.

My secret stays hidden, but it gives me strength. When I face a difficult problem, I think of the patience of a tree that waits years for its leaves to grow. When I feel tired, I remember the endurance of a forest that stands through seasons. I am a teenage student, yes, but inside me lives a wood elf, a quiet reminder that there is magic in the world, even in the middle of a busy school day.

And maybe one day, when the time is right, I will share this secret with my friends. Until then, I will keep walking the hallways, feeling the hidden whispers of the wood elves in every step I take. [end of text]
