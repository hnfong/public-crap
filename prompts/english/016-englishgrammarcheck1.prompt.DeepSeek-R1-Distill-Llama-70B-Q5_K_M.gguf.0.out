Okay, so I need to review this text and point out grammar mistakes, especially tense and agreement issues, serious stylistic problems, and other issues. The user wants at least five points in each category, but I should avoid minor issues. Let me go through the text step by step.

First, I'll read through the text to get a general sense. It's about Andreessen Horowitz's comments on tech workers not doing enough, the author's thoughts on investing in META and GOOG, and reflections on the tech industry's future.

Starting with grammar issues. I'll look for subject-verb agreement and tense consistency.

1. In the first paragraph, "So there's a running story..." uses "there's" which is singular, but "story" is singular, so that's correct. Wait, no, "there's" is correct because it's referring to a singular story. Maybe that's fine.

2. "people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence." That seems okay.

3. "this might seem to an unwarranted assault" – wait, "seem" should be followed by "like" or "as if." So it should be "seem like an unwarranted assault." That's a grammar mistake.

4. "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective." That seems okay.

5. "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic" – "on the same line" is correct, but "exactly" might be better as "exactly the same line." Not sure if that's a mistake, but maybe it's more about style.

6. "META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products" – that's correct.

7. "their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down." That's okay.

8. "when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit" – "layoff" should be "lay off" as two words. That's a grammar issue.

9. "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations." "Day-to-day" should be hyphenated. Also, "operations" is plural, so "affecting" is correct.

10. "McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." That's correct.

11. "In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude" – that's a bit long but grammatically correct.

12. "ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid." Correct.

13. "The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust)" – "is" is singular, "risk" is singular, so correct.

14. "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." "In America We Trust" is a phrase, but it's used as a sentence fragment. It should be connected properly, maybe with a comma or as a separate sentence.

15. "There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn." That's correct.

16. "I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years" – "in say" is informal, but not a grammar issue.

17. "tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift." "REALLY" is in caps, which is more stylistic but not a grammar issue.

18. "With interest rates still held 'high', the free money is draining away" – correct.

19. "the promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech)" – "is" should be "are" because "pockets" is plural. That's a subject-verb agreement issue.

20. "the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial 'efficiency'." Correct.

21. "This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium" – correct.

22. "i.e., these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market" – "i.e." should be followed by a comma, which it is, but the sentence is a bit long.

23. "product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard." That's a verb form issue; "enshittification" is a noun, so it should be "until antitrust laws slam down hard." Or maybe "until antitrust takes action."

24. "Those who read history knows" – should be "know" because "those" is plural. Subject-verb agreement mistake.

25. "every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another." "Phrase" should be "phase." That's a word choice issue.

26. "Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance." That's correct.

27. "That said, it has been a fun ride." Correct.

28. "People who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally" – correct.

29. "it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later." "gonna" is informal, but not a grammar issue.

30. "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years" – "what" should be "what their careers will look like" for correct tense.

31. "and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing."
