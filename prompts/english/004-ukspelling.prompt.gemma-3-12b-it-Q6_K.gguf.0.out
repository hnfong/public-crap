Right then, let me tell you about my favourite rainbows. Not the big, bright ones you see after a proper summer shower, though those are lovely. No, I adore the sneaky rainbows.

You know, the ones that pop up when the sun’s peeking out from behind grey clouds on a drizzly day? They’re often faint, a whisper of colour across the sky. Sometimes they’re just a little curve, barely there at all. 

I like them best when I’m walking the dog, and they suddenly appear over the rooftops. They feel like a secret, just for me. A little bit of magic in a drizzly afternoon. They remind me that even when things are a bit grey, there’s always a splash of colour waiting to be found. 

Those quiet, shy rainbows? They’re the best, definitely.



Hope you liked that! [end of text]
