1. The main thesis of the text is that suffering and evil in the world are subjective experiences chosen by individuals within God's creation, which encompasses all possibilities, and that our perception of suffering is a personal choice rather than an objective reality imposed by God.

2. I partially agree. While the text raises interesting points about the subjective nature of experience and the role of perception in shaping our reality, it overlooks the tangible and systemic causes of suffering that many people face, such as poverty, war, and disease. Suffering is not always a matter of personal choice but often a result of external circumstances and societal structures.

3.  
In God's vast, all-seeing frame,  
We choose the lens through which we name.  
Suffering, evil, seen or not,  
Are shadows cast by what we've got.  
A doll tiger, fierce or mild,  
Is but a thought, a fleeting child.  
Yet in this play of light and dark,  
We hold the brush, the painter's mark.  
To shift the scene, to change the hue,  
Is but a choice, a path we pursue.  
In God's creation, wide and free,  
We shape our world, we shape what we see. [end of text]
