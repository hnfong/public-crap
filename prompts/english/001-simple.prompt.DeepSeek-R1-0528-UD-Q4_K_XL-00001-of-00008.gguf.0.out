Okay, the user has asked three distinct questions. Let me tackle them one by one. 

First question is about when the letter "A" first appears in English number spellings. Hmm, I recall that most small numbers don't contain "A" - one, two, three, etc. The earliest might be "thousand" but that's not a number itself. After checking mentally: ten (no A), hundred (no), thousand (no)... ah! "One thousand" has no A either. Then I remember "one hundred and one" - still no. The breakthrough comes at 1,000 when we say "one thousand", but wait - "and" isn't part of the number word. The actual number word with A is... "thousand" itself doesn't have A. Let me think bigger. Aha! "One hundred one" skips "and" in some styles, but still no A. Then it hits me - "eight" has no A but "eighteen" does! No, eighteen is E-I-G-H-T-E-E-N - no A. Eighty? E-I-G-H-T-Y - still no. What about fractions? No, user said whole numbers. Then it clicks: "one thousand" is the first? No... wait! "Hundred" has no A but "thousand" has no A either. I need to go higher. "Million"! M-I-L-L-I-O-N - has no A. "Billion"? B-I-L-L-I-O-N - still no. This is tricky. Perhaps "and" is considered? But that's not part of the standard spelling. Wait... what about "a hundred"? But that's not a number word. Then I recall: the number 1,000 is "one thousand" - all those words lack A. But 1,001 is "one thousand one" - still no. Unless... ah! When we write "one thousand and one" the "and" has A, but technically "and" isn't part of the number word. The actual number word containing A must be... let's think of "eight" again. No. "Four"? No. "Five"? No. Then it strikes me: "thousand" has no A, but "hundred" has no A, but what about "billion"? Still no. Perhaps "quadrillion"? Q-U-A-D-R-I-L-L-I-O-N - there it is! "Quadrillion" has an A! But is that the smallest? What about "trillion"? T-R-I-L-L-I-O-N - no A. "Billion" - no. "Million" - no. So quadrillion is 10^15. But is there a smaller one? What about "hundred and one"? The "and" has A but isn't a number word. Or "a hundred" - "a" has A but is an article. So strictly speaking, the first number whose standard spelling contains A is "one quadrillion" at 1,000,000,000,000,000. But is there a smaller one? Let me confirm: 1,000 is one thousand - no A. 10,000 ten thousand - no. 100,000 hundred thousand - no. 1,000,000 million - no. 10^9 billion - no. 10^12 trillion - no. 10^15 quadrillion - yes, has A. So that's the answer.

Second question is about completing "The quick brown fox..." and why it's famous. That's easy - it's "jumps over the lazy dog." It's famous as a pangram - a sentence using every letter of the alphabet. Used for typing practice and font displays. Simple recall.

Third request is creative: merge Three Little Pigs with Little Red Riding Hood. Need to make it cohesive. The pigs are building houses - straw, sticks, bricks. Wolf blows down first two houses. Then Red Riding Hood enters, going to grandma's. Wolf tries to trick her but pigs warn her. Wolf attacks brick house but fails. They trap him. Moral about preparation and cooperation. Should keep it short but include key elements: houses, wolf's destruction, Red's appearance, joint victory. Make sure both stories' essences are preserved. 

User seems curious - first question is linguistic trivia, second is general knowledge, third is creative. Might be testing range of knowledge or just playful. The number question is particularly clever - many would guess "thousand" but it's actually much higher. Should explain clearly why smaller numbers don't work. For the story, balance both tales without favoring one. Keep it light but logical.

Here are the answers to your questions:

1.  **One thousand (1,000)** is the smallest whole number whose standard English spelling contains the letter "A".
    *   **Why?** Smaller numbers like one, two, ..., ten, eleven, twelve, ..., twenty, thirty, ..., hundred (100) do not contain the letter "A". "One thousand" is the first number where the word "thousand" itself is used, and "thousand" contains an "A".
    *   *Note: While phrases like "a hundred" or "one hundred and one" contain an "A", the "A" comes from the article "a" or the conjunction "and", not from the actual number word itself ("hundred", "one"). The first number word containing an "A" is "thousand".*

2.  **Complete Sentence:** "The quick brown fox **jumps over the lazy dog.**"
    *   **What it's famous for:** This sentence is a **pangram**. It's famous because it uses every letter of the English alphabet at least once. It's commonly used to display fonts (showing all characters), test keyboards, and practice typing.

3.  **Short Story: The Three Little Pigs Meet Little Red Riding Hood**

    Once upon a time, three little pigs set out to build their homes. The first built a house of straw, the second of sticks, and the third, wisely, of sturdy bricks. A big, bad wolf soon came sniffing. With a mighty "HUFF AND PUFF," he blew down the straw house, then the stick house. The terrified pigs fled to their brother's brick house just in time.

    As the wolf, frustrated by the strong bricks, paced outside, he spotted Little Red Riding Hood skipping down the path, basket in hand, heading to her grandmother's cottage deeper in the woods. A wicked grin spread across his face. *Two meals in one day!* he thought.

    He dashed ahead, hoping to reach Granny's first. But the clever pigs, peeking from their window, saw his plan. When Little Red approached the brick house, the pigs urgently whispered, "Little Red! Stop! The wolf is heading to your Granny's! He just tried to eat us!"

    Little Red gasped. Together, they hatched a plan. While the wolf was disguised in Granny's bed, Little Red knocked. "Oh Granny, what big eyes you have!" she called, playing along. As the wolf prepared to pounce, the three pigs burst in through the back door! One threw a bucket of water (meant for making mortar), another banged a pot lid, and the third shouted loudly.

    Startled and soaking, the wolf tumbled out of bed and fled out the window, howling into the forest, never to bother pigs or little girls in those woods again. The pigs, Little Red, and Granny (who had been safely hidden in the brick pig's pantry) celebrated with the contents of the basket, learning that preparation, brick houses, and friends looking out for each other are the best defenses against wolves.
