Here’s a review of your text, focusing on **grammar mistakes (especially tense/agreement issues)** and **serious stylistic issues** (excluding minor phrasing or sentence structure):

---

### **Grammar Mistakes (Tense/Agreement Issues)**
1. **"So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying..."**
   - *"There's"* should be *"there is"* (subject-verb agreement: "story" is singular, but "there" is a formal singular form in this context; *"there's"* is colloquial and informal).

2. **"I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something..."**
   - *"He's"* is correct (referring to Andreessen Horowitz), but the phrasing *"can't help but"* is awkward in formal writing. Better: *"I can't help but agree that he is probably onto something"* (or *"I can't help agreeing"*).

3. **"My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic..."**
   - *"Was"* is correct (past tense), but *"line of logic"* is slightly informal. Better: *"My analysis at the time aligned with the same logic"* (or *"followed the same line of reasoning"*).

4. **"...it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit..."**
   - *"They"* is correct (referring to META/GOOG), but the sentence is awkwardly structured. Better: *"Their monopolies appear functional, allowing them to extract significant profits..."* (or *"It seems their monopolies remain intact, enabling them to squeeze profits..."*).

5. **"...and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half..."**
   - *"They can"* is incorrect here—should be *"they could"* (past tense to match *"had"*).
   - *"Ounce of doubt"* is incorrect; it should be *"scruple"* or *"hesitation"* (or simply *"I had no doubt"*).

6. **"...McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders..."**
   - *"McKinsey Pichai"* is incorrect—it should be *"Pichai"* (Sundar Pichai) or *"Pichai (of Google)"* (if referring to his role). *"McKinsey"* is a consulting firm, not a person.
   - *"Pleases"* is incorrect—should be *"pleases"* (present tense is fine, but *"pleases"* is correct as a gerund).

7. **"...if only because I would have hated how I participated..."**
   - *"Would have hated"* is correct (past conditional), but the sentence is awkward. Better: *"I refrained from trading, partly because I would have resented enabling such practices."*

8. **"...the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough..."**
   - *"They're"* is correct (referring to Americans), but *"In America We Trust"* is informal and awkward. Better: *"But I trust American capitalists won’t kill their golden goose."* (or *"But I’m confident American capitalists won’t sabotage their own success."*)

9. **"...besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech..."**
   - *"Is"* is incorrect—should be *"are"* (plural subject *"pockets"*).

10. **"...the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial 'efficiency'."**
    - *"Is taking over"* is correct, but the sentence is abrupt. Better: *"The ruthless capitalist engine is now dominating, prioritizing financial efficiency over innovation."*

### **Serious Stylistic Issues**
1. **Overuse of Informal/Conversational Tone**
   - Phrases like *"So there's"*, *"I mean"*, *"we're still sane though"*, and *"the party's gonna end"* undermine credibility. These should be rephrased for a more analytical tone.
   - Example: *"As the narrative goes, Andreessen Horowitz has criticized tech workers..."* (instead of *"So there's a running story..."*).

2. **Unclear or Ambiguous References**
   - *"McKinsey Pichai"* (should be *"Pichai"* or *"Sundar Pichai"*).
   - *"GOOG mainly"* is unclear—does this refer to Google or Alphabet? Specify.
   - *"we're still sane though"* is vague—what does this mean? Remove or clarify.

3. **Lack of Logical Flow in Complex Arguments**
   - The shift from *"I didn’t trade"* to *"ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid"* is abrupt. The transition between personal stance and analysis is jarring.
   - Example: *"While I personally avoided trading due to ethical concerns, the underlying economic logic remains compelling..."*

4. **Overuse of Parenthetical Clarifications**
   - *"(GOOG mainly)"*, *"(as a whole)"*, *"(we're still sane though)"*—these interrupt the flow. Either integrate them naturally or omit them.
   - Example: *"Google (particularly in its first 2023 layoffs) has shown willingness to prioritize shareholder demands."*

5. **Unsubstantiated or Overly Cynical Claims Without Evidence**
   - *"The ruthless capitalist engine is taking over..."* and *"product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard"* are strong claims that lack concrete evidence or sources. Either:
     - Cite specific examples (e.g., *"As seen with [Company X]’s
