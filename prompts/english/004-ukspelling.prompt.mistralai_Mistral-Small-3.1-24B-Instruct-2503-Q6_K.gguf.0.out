In the heart of the Lake District, there's a special place where rainbows love to play. After a rainy day, when the sun peeks out, the sky lights up with the most beautiful rainbows I've ever seen.

My favourite rainbows are the ones that stretch from one side of the valley to the other, like a giant, colourful bridge. They start with a bright red at the top, then orange, yellow, green, blue, and finally, a deep indigo at the bottom. Sometimes, if you're lucky, you can see a second, fainter rainbow inside the first one.

These rainbows make the green hills and blue lakes look even more magical. They dance and shimmer, changing shape as the clouds move. It's like nature's own light show, just for us.

One day, I saw a double rainbow so clear, I could even see the faintest hint of a third one. It was breathtaking. That's when I knew â€“ these Lake District rainbows are the most wonderful in the world. They turn an ordinary day into something extraordinary. [end of text]
