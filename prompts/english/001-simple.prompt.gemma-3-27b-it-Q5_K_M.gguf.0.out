## Answers to your questions:

**1. How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?**

You would have to count to **one hundred and one** (101) before using the letter "A". Let's break it down:

* One, two, three... ninety-nine don't contain "A".
* One hundred doesn't contain "A".
* **One hundred and one** *does* contain "A".

**2. Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox ..."; What is the sentence famous for?**

"The quick brown fox **jumps over the lazy dog**."

This sentence is famous for being a **pangram**. A pangram is a sentence that uses every letter of the alphabet at least once. It's often used to test typewriters, computer fonts, and keyboard layouts.

**3. Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.**

The first two little pigs, still basking in the comfort of their straw and stick houses, were startled by a flurry of red. Little Red Riding Hood, basket swinging, hurried past their homes, looking quite flustered.

“Oh dear, oh dear!” she cried. “I’m late to Grandma’s, and I’ve lost the path!”

The first little pig, too lazy to help, simply waved a hoof. “Good luck with that!” he called. The second pig, slightly more considerate, pointed vaguely towards the woods. “It’s… that way, I think.”

Red Riding Hood sighed and continued on, soon reaching the sturdy brick house of the third little pig. He was known for being practical and kind.

“What’s wrong, little one?” he asked, seeing her worried face.

Red Riding Hood explained her predicament. The third little pig, remembering his own struggles building his strong house, immediately offered help. “Don’t worry,” he said. “I know these woods well. I’ll walk with you a little way to get you back on the path.”

As they walked, the third little pig warned Red Riding Hood about the dangers of talking to strangers. He even pointed out a suspicious-looking wolf lurking in the shadows. Red Riding Hood, grateful for his help and advice, thanked him profusely. 

“You’re a very kind pig,” she said. “And a very smart one to build such a strong house!”

The third little pig smiled. He knew a strong house and a kind heart were the best protection of all. Red Riding Hood continued on her way, feeling much safer, and the third little pig returned to his home, content knowing he’d helped a friend in need.
