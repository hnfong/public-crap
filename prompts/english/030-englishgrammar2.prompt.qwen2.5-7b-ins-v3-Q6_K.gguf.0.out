Here are a couple sentences in both Cantonese and English. They are written by somebody who is a native Cantonese speaker, but not necessarily good in English. Review the English translations and suggest modifications, keeping in mind sentences should be simple, fluent, written like a native speaker, and to the point. If the sentence does not need changes, just output the original sentence.

For example:

A. 啲貨咁好賣，唔使慌賺唔到錢喎。 The goods are selling so well, there's no need to fear that you cannot earn money.
B. 美國每四年會舉行一次總統選舉。 The United States will held a presidential election every four years.

Expected output:

A. Suggested sentence: The goods are selling so well, you don't need to worry about not making money.
B. Suggested sentence: The United States holds a presidential election every four years.

Here are the sentences for you to review. In your answer, give one suggested English translation per sentence, or just output the original sentence if no changes are needed.

1. 你咁趕做咩啫，你慌人哋唔等你咩？ Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?
2. 佢份人夠大量，唔同班𡃁仔計較。 He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids.
3. 學語文冇捷徑，要靠大量浸淫。 There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it.
4. 小新喺同事面前讚美女朋友有幾温柔。 Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender.
5. 我日日都搭地鐵返學。 I take the metro to school every day.

Alright, I need to review these Cantonese sentences translated into English and suggest modifications to make them more fluent and natural, as if spoken by a native English speaker. Let's go through each sentence one by one.

1. **Original Sentence:** 你咁趕做咩啫，你慌人哋唔等你咩？ Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?
   
   *Analysis:* The translation is a bit choppy and doesn't flow naturally in English. The use of "做咩啫" is colloquial and might not be necessary in a formal translation. Also, the phrasing "Why are you hurry?" is awkward.

   *Suggested Modification:* Remove "做咩啫" and rephrase to make it smoother.
   
   *Final Sentence:* Why are you in such a hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?

2. **Original Sentence:** 佢份人夠大量，唔同班𡃁仔計較。 He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids.
   
   *Analysis:* The translation is accurate but could be made more fluent. The phrase "唔同班𡃁仔計較" is a bit archaic and might not be commonly used in modern English.

   *Suggested Modification:* Replace "唔同班𡃁仔計較" with a more contemporary expression.
   
   *Final Sentence:* He is a magnanimous person who doesn't haggle over trivial matters with the kids.

3. **Original Sentence:** 學語文冇捷徑，要靠大量浸淫。 There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it.
   
   *Analysis:* The translation is clear but could be made more idiomatic. Phrases like "massive exposure" are understandable but might be too direct.

   *Suggested Modification:* Use a more natural expression for "massive exposure."
   
   *Final Sentence:* There is no shortcut to learning a language; the key is extensive exposure to it.

4. **Original Sentence:** 小新喺同事面前讚美女朋友有幾温柔。 Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender.
   
   *Analysis:* The translation is accurate but could be made more fluent. The structure is a bit awkward, and the word "tender" might not be the best choice here.

   *Suggested Modification:* Adjust the sentence structure and choose a more appropriate adjective.
   
   *Final Sentence:* Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her gentle nature.

5. **Original Sentence:** 我日日都搭地鐵返學。 I take the metro to school every day.
   
   *Analysis:* The translation is straightforward and clear. It doesn't require any modification.
   
   *Final Sentence:* I take the metro to school every day.
