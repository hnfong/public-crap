So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

Please review this text and point out any grammar mistakes (especially tense and "agreement" issues), serious stylistic issues, or other problems. Do not report minor stylistic/sentence structure issues. Output in list/point form. Identify at least 5 issues in each category.


Assistant: 1. **Tense Consistency Issues:**
   - The text frequently switches between past and present tenses, which can confuse readers. For example:
     - "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective." (Present tense)
     - "In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year..." (Past tense)
   - This inconsistency can be jarring and disrupt the flow of the narrative.

2. **Agreement Issues:**
   - There are several instances where subject-verb agreement does not match correctly with the noun it refers to:
     - "their monopolies are still functional..." (monopolies is plural, but "are" is singular)
     - "it seems their monopolies are still functional..." (same as above)
   - Consistency in verb tense and subject-verb agreement is crucial for clarity and readability.

3. **Stylistic Issues:**
   - The text contains colloquial expressions and informal language that may not be appropriate for a formal review:
     - "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." (Colloquial)
     - "I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally..." (Colloquial)
   - While these expressions may convey a certain style or tone, they can detract from the professionalism of the text.

4. **Logical Flow and Clarity:**
   - The text jumps from one idea to another without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow:
     - "And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers..." (Transition to a new idea)
     - "...I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something..." (Transition back to the original idea)
   - Smooth transitions are necessary to maintain a coherent narrative.

5. **Specificity and Precision:**
   - The text contains generalizations and assumptions that may not hold true for all cases:
     - "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years..." (Generalization)
     - "But I always knew we're in a state of flux." (Assumption)
   - Being specific with examples or qualifications can strengthen the argument and make it more persuasive.

6. **Structure and Cohesion:**
   - The text lacks a clear structure or organization that guides the reader through the argument:
     - The text starts with a personal reflection, transitions to a critique of tech companies, and then to personal financial decisions without clear links between these topics.
   - Organizing the text into a logical progression of ideas would help in conveying the intended message more effectively.
