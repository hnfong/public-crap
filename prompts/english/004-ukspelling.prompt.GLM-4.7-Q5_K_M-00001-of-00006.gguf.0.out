My favourite rainbows are the shy ones. They do not come out when the sun is bright. They hide until the weather is grumpy and grey.

First, the sky gets dark. Then, the rain falls hard. It splashes on the pavement and makes the trees dance. But when the sun peeks through a gap in the clouds, the magic happens.

A giant arc of light appears. It has seven bright colours. I see red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. It looks like a giant bridge or a smile from the sky.

I like the rainbows that fade fast. If you blink, you might miss them. They remind me to look up, even on a rainy day. They make the wet world feel colourful and happy again. [end of text]
