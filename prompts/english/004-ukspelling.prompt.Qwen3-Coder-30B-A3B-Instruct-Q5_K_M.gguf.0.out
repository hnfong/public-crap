**The Magic Rainbow**

Tom loved rainbows more than anything. Every time it rained, he would run outside to look for them.

One afternoon, after a big rainstorm, Tom saw the most beautiful rainbow. It stretched from his garden to the far hill. The colours were so bright - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple.

"Wow!" said Tom. "It looks like a bridge!"

His little sister Lily came running. "Can we touch it?" she asked.

"No," said Tom, "but we can draw it. Let's make a rainbow picture."

They drew the rainbow on paper, using all the colours. Tom liked how rainbows appeared after storms. They showed that beautiful things could come after difficult times.

Tom's teacher, Mrs. Brown, saw his drawing. "That's a lovely rainbow," she said. "It reminds us that hope comes after sadness."

Tom smiled. He loved rainbows because they made him feel happy and hopeful.
