The best rainbows are the ones that come after a big storm.  
I saw one last week.  
It started with a tiny bow, like a smile.  
Then it grew and grew, right across the sky.  
Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple—every colour I could name.  
I ran outside and jumped in the puddles.  
The rainbow didn’t mind.  
It stayed there, big and bright, while I splashed.  
Mummy said, “Look how happy you are.”  
I was.  
I took a photo, but it didn’t look the same.  
So I drew it instead.  
Now it hangs on the fridge.  
Next time it rains, I’ll wait for the next one.  
I like the quiet ones best.  
The ones that don’t shout, just shine. [end of text]
