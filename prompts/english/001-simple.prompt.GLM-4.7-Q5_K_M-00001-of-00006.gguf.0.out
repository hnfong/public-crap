Here are the answers to your questions:

**1. How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?**
You would have to count all the way to **one thousand** (1,000).

If you spell out the numbers from zero to nine hundred ninety-nine, you will not find the letter "A". It does not appear in "one," "two," "three," "hundred," or any combination thereof. The first time the letter appears is in the word "thousand."

**2. Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox ..."; What is the sentence famous for?**
The complete sentence is: **"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."**

It is famous for being a **pangram**—a sentence that uses every letter of the English alphabet at least once. Because of this, it is commonly used for testing typefaces, computer fonts, and typewriters to ensure that all letters are visible and distinct.

**3. Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.**

Once upon a time, after the Three Little Pigs had successfully outsmarted the Big Bad Wolf and sent him yelping down the chimney, they decided to enjoy a well-deserved vacation. They packed a basket of apples and bricks (just in case) and went for a stroll in the nearby forest.

Meanwhile, Little Red Riding Hood was skipping along the path on her way to her grandmother’s house. She was carrying a basket of goodies, but she was feeling a bit nervous. She had heard a rustling in the bushes and feared the Wolf might be lurking nearby.

Suddenly, Red burst into a clearing and nearly collided with the Third Pig, who was busy inspecting a tree for structural integrity.

"Oh my!" Red cried out. "Is that you, Mr. Wolf? Please don't eat me!"

The Third Pig adjusted his hard hat and smiled. "Don't worry, little one. I'm a pig. The Wolf is currently nursing a burnt bottom at home."

The First and Second Pigs caught up, panting heavily. "Is everything okay?" asked the Second Pig, who was still out of breath from the walk.

Red explained that she was afraid to walk through the dense part of the woods alone. The Three Pigs huddled together. They knew exactly what it felt like to be hunted.

"We will escort you," said the First Pig bravely. "We are experts in wolf defense."

As they walked, the group chatted. Red was fascinated by their architectural skills, and the pigs were delighted by the smell of the muffins in her basket. When they reached a dark, shadowy part of the path, a low growl emanated from the bushes.

The pigs sprang into action. The First Pig grabbed a fallen branch. The Second Pig puffed out his chest, ready to run. The Third Pig pulled a blueprint out of his pocket, planning to build a barricade.

Red, however, stepped forward and pulled a flashlight from her basket, shining it directly into the bushes. A small, grumpy badger blinked and scurried away.

"Just a badger," Red giggled.

The pigs sighed in relief. Finally, they arrived at Grandmother’s cottage. It was a charming house made of... straw.

The Third Pig gasped. "Ma'am, with all due respect, this is a fire hazard. And structurally unsound against predators."

Grandma invited them in for tea. Impressed by the pigs' concern, she hired them on the spot to renovate her house into a sturdy brick cottage. Little Red Riding Hood sat safely by the fire, eating muffins with her new friends, knowing that with three little pigs as guards, the Big Bad Wolf would never dare to come near. [end of text]
