Let's break down the information step by step:

1. Initially:
   - There are 3 black blocks on top of an unknown color block (let's call it X).
   - Beneath X, there is a blue block.

   So the stack from top to bottom is: 3 black blocks, X, blue.

2. We remove all blocks and shuffle them with one additional green block.
   So now we have: 3 black, X, blue, and green.

3. Then we put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of the blue block.

   Wait, there was no yellow block mentioned initially. The only colors mentioned are black, blue, green, and the unknown X. So where did yellow come from?

   This seems inconsistent. Let me read again: "The yellow block is on top of blue block."

   But in the shuffled set, we have 3 black, X, blue, green. There is no yellow. Unless the unknown X is yellow? That might be the case.

   So after shuffling, we have five blocks: 3 black, X, blue, green. When reassembled, yellow is on top of blue. Since yellow isn't in the list except possibly as X, it must be that X is yellow.

   Therefore, the unknown block is yellow.

   So the answer should be yellow.
