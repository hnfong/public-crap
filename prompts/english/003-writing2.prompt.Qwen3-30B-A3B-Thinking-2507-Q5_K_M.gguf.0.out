Okay, the user wants a story under 10 words about loss or grief. That's... extremely tight. 

Hmm, they're probably testing conciseness or processing emotional weight in minimalism. Maybe they've experienced grief themselves and want that raw, gut-punch feeling in a whisper. 

*Brainstorming*: "Empty chair" implies absence but needs context. "Cold coffee" feels mundane yet heavy. Wait—"Last sip gone" works because: 
- "Last" = finality of loss 
- "Sip" = intimate, human action 
- "Gone" = active emptiness, not just "was" 

*Counting words*: "Last sip gone." That's 3 words. Under limit. 

*Double-checking*: Does it convey grief? Yes—implied someone's gone, leaving a ritual (sipping) incomplete. No fluff. 

*User insight*: They didn't specify tone, so I'll avoid clichés ("heaven" etc.). This feels universal—like a widow's morning, or a friend's silence. 

*Self-check*: Yep, 3 words. Nailed it.
