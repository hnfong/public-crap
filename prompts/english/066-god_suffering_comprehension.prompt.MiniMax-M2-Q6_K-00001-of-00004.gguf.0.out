**1. Main thesis (≤3 sentences)**  
The text argues that God is the infinite, impersonal source of all existence, and that we are conscious vessels (“qualia”) who create our own subjective experiences by choosing what to perceive. Suffering and evil are not objective features of reality but personal choices of belief and attention; we can always change our perspective. Thus, the existence of suffering does not contradict God’s nature because it reflects our own chosen experience of creation.

**2. Do I agree? (concise)**  
I find the core insight—that our attention and beliefs shape our experience—valuable and psychologically useful. However, I disagree that suffering is merely a subjective choice; many harms (e.g., disease, violence) are objectively real and constrain agency. The view risks blaming victims and oversimplifying complex systemic issues.

**3. Poem (rhymed)**  
In boundless space, the Source does weave,  
All things arise, and none deceive.  
We are the lenses, bright and true,  
Choosing the light we come to view.  

Suffering’s shadow, sharp and deep,  
Is but the focus we choose to keep.  
Shift the lens, the scene rewrites,  
For we are both the pain and light. [end of text]
