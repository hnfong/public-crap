### Questions:

1. **Explain the main thesis of the text in at most 3 sentences.**
   The text argues that God creates everything and that suffering and evil are subjective experiences chosen by individuals. It posits that humans are vessels for experiencing God's creation and that our subjective experiences, including suffering, are a result of our choices. The author suggests that the perception of suffering and evil is a personal decision and that one can change their experiences by altering their choices.

2. **Do you agree? Explain but be concise.**
   I do not fully agree. While the idea that subjective experiences shape our perception of suffering is valid, it oversimplifies the complex nature of suffering and evil. Many forms of suffering are beyond individual control, such as natural disasters or systemic injustices, and attributing them solely to personal choice can be dismissive of genuine hardships.

3. **Write a short poem (ideally that rhymes) based on the information above.**

   In realms where God's creation unfolds,
   We choose our paths, our joys and woes.
   Suffering and evil, tales we're told,
   Are choices we make, as seeds we sow.

   Our souls in bodies, experiences we weave,
   In ignorance or knowledge, we believe.
   The tiger of pain, a doll we perceive,
   In our minds, we choose to grieve or to leave. [end of text]
