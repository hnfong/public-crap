Title: The Secret Rainbow

In a small village in the UK, nestled between rolling hills and whispering woods, there was a special rainbow that appeared only after the rain. It wasn’t just any rainbow; it was the one that little Ellie loved the most.

Ellie would sit by her window, watching the raindrops dance on the glass. When the sun peeked out, she’d rush outside, her heart full of hope. One day, after a gentle shower, she saw it—a rainbow stretching across the sky, its colours vibrant and alive.

But this rainbow was different. It seemed to shimmer with a secret. Ellie noticed that if she followed it, it led her to a hidden meadow, where wildflowers bloomed in every shade of the rainbow. In the middle of the meadow stood a single, ancient oak tree, its branches reaching out like welcoming arms.

Ellie would sit under the tree, feeling the warmth of the sun and the cool breeze. She imagined the rainbow as a bridge between the sky and the earth, a magical path that only she could see.

This was her secret rainbow, a place of wonder and peace, where Ellie felt connected to the world in a way she never had before. And every time the rain fell, she knew it would be there, waiting for her. [end of text]
