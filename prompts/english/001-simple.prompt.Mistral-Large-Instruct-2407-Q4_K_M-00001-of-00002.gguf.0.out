 1. The first time the letter "A" appears in the English language spelling of a whole number is at "One thousand" (1,000).

2. "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." This sentence is famous for being a pangram, which means it uses every letter of the alphabet at least once. It's often used for typing practice or to display fonts.

3. Once upon a time, in a deep, green forest, there lived three little pigs who were brothers. One day, while they were gathering materials to build their houses, they met a young girl with a red cloak and a basket of goodies. She was Little Red Riding Hood.

"Hello," said the first little pig, "I'm building a house of straw. Would you like to help?"

"Thank you, but I'm on my way to visit my grandmother," Little Red Riding Hood replied. "I have some food and medicine for her."

The second little pig, who was collecting sticks, asked, "Would you like to help me instead? My house will be sturdier."

Little Red Riding Hood politely declined again, "I'm sorry, but I must hurry to grandmother's house."

The third little pig, who was mixing bricks and mortar, said, "I understand. Family comes first. But if you ever need help, you can find us here."

Little Red Riding Hood smiled and continued on her journey. Later that day, the three little pigs heard a big, bad wolf howling. They remembered Little Red Riding Hood and hoped she was safe. Just then, there was a knock at the third pig's door. It was Little Red Riding Hood!

"I took a shortcut and escaped the wolf," she said. The pigs invited her in, and together, they enjoyed the goodies from her basket, happy to have made a new friend. From that day forward, they looked out for each other, proving that friendship and kindness make the forest a safer place for everyone. [end of text]
