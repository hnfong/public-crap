 1. You would have to count up to one thousand before using the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number. The word "thousand" is the first number to contain the letter "A".

2. "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." This sentence is famous for being a pangram, which means it uses every letter of the alphabet at least once. It's often used for typing practice or to display fonts.

3. Once upon a time, in a deep, green forest, there lived three little pigs who were brothers. One day, while they were gathering materials to build their houses, they met a young girl with a red cloak and a basket of goodies. She was Little Red Riding Hood.

"Hello," said the first little pig, "I'm building a house of straw. Would you like to help?"

"Thank you, but I'm on my way to visit my grandmother," Little Red Riding Hood replied. "I have some food and medicine for her."

The second little pig, who was collecting sticks, asked, "Would you like to help me instead? My house will be sturdier."

Little Red Riding Hood politely declined again, "I'm sorry, but I must hurry to grandmother's house."

The third little pig, who was mixing bricks and mortar, said, "I understand. Family comes first. But if you ever need help, you can find us here."

Little Red Riding Hood smiled and continued on her journey. Later, when the Big Bad Wolf tried to trick her, she remembered the kindness of the three little pigs and rushed back to them for help. Together, they outsmarted the wolf and Little Red Riding Hood safely reached her grandmother's house. From that day forward, they were great friends, and the pigs even helped Little Red Riding Hood build a strong, brick house for her grandmother. And they all lived happily and safely ever after.
