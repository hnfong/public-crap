Based on the description, Bob ate **whole wheat bread with tomato sauce and cheese** - essentially a type of pizza or open-faced sandwich.

Breaking it down:
- "Baked whole wheat" = whole wheat bread/crust
- "Seasoned tomato pur√©e spread on" = tomato sauce
- "Aged organic milk tossed over" = cheese (aged milk products like cheese)

**Was it healthy?** Yes, relatively speaking:
- Whole wheat bread is healthier than white bread (more fiber, nutrients)
- Fresh tomato sauce provides vitamins and lycopene
- However, cheese adds saturated fat and calories

Alice's "wtf" reaction was likely because Bob described this simple, common food (pizza/sandwich) in an overly complicated, pretentious way - making it sound like some fancy health food when it's basically just a grilled cheese or pizza. She probably expected to see something more elaborate given his flowery description, but saw a regular sandwich/pizza instead.

Bob was being unnecessarily verbose about a simple, everyday meal while trying to impress Alice with his "healthy" eating habits. [end of text]
