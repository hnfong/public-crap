**1. Main Thesis (≤3 sentences):**  
The text argues that suffering and evil in the world are ultimately the result of individual subjective choices about how to experience reality. God, as the creator of everything, does not impose suffering, but humans choose their experiences, including the perception of suffering. Therefore, the existence of suffering is a matter of personal perspective and belief, not an external imposition.

**2. Do I agree? (Concise):**  
I partially agree. While I accept that perception shapes experience and that suffering can be influenced by mindset, I also recognize that some suffering arises from circumstances beyond individual control, such as natural disasters or systemic injustice. However, the text’s point that we have agency in how we respond and interpret these events is valid.

**3. Short Rhyming Poem:**

In God’s vast garden, all is made,  
Each soul a choice, each path we’ve laid.  
We see what we will, we feel what we choose,  
Suffering’s a mask, if we but refuse.  
The world is a mirror, reflecting our view—  
What do you see, dear heart, is up to you. [end of text]
