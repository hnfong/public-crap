To solve this problem, we need to consider the different possibilities of how the blocks can be arranged after shuffling them with the additional green block. 

Since the yellow block is on top of the blue block, it means that the blue block must have been on the bottom before the shuffle. 

Now, let's consider the three black blocks. They can be arranged in different ways, but since we don't have any information about their order, we can't determine the color of the block we don't know. 

Therefore, the color of the block we don't know the color of can be any color, and it cannot be determined with the given information. 

The answer is: any
<|im_end|>
