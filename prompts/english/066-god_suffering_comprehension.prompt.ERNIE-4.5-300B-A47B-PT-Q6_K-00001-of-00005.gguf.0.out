1. The text argues that God, as an infinite creator, nurtures all existence, and human suffering arises from our subjective choices to experience certain aspects of reality, which we perceive as evil or suffering due to limited perspectives and desires conflicting with the broader reality. It posits that our experiences, including suffering, are ultimately self-selected, and we can change them by altering our perceptions and choices.  

2. I partially agree. While the idea that perception shapes experience has merit, attributing all suffering to subjective choice overlooks systemic injustices and biological constraints. Agency exists, but it’s not absolute; external factors limit freedom.  

3.  
*God’s tapestry, vast and wide,*  
*We choose the threads we abide.*  
*Suffering? A lens we craft,*  
*Shift the gaze—the pain is draft.*  
*Infinite realms, we hold the key,*  
*To dance in light or dark, we’re free.* [end of text]
