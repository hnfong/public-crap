1. You would have to count to 26 before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number. This is because the number 26 is the first number that contains the letter "A" as its representation (twenty-six).

2. "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." This sentence is famous for being a classic example of a pangram, a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet at least once.

3. Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived three little pigs who were great friends with Little Red Riding Hood. One day, they decided to go on an adventure together. As they were walking through the forest, they came across a tall and sturdy brick house. The first little pig was excited to explore it, but the second little pig was hesitant, remembering the stories of the big bad wolf. Just then, they heard a familiar howl in the distance. It was the big bad wolf! The little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood quickly ran into the brick house and locked the door. The wolf, unable to break through the sturdy walls, eventually gave up and went away, leaving the friends safe and sound. From that day on, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became even closer friends, and they lived happily ever after. [end of text]
