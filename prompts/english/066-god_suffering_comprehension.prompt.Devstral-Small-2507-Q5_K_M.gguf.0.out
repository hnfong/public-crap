1. The main thesis of the text is that God, as a mechanism or law of the universe, creates everything, including our subjective experiences. We are vessels for experiencing God's creation, and our experiences, including suffering and evil, are our choices. The text argues that suffering and evil are not objective realities but subjective choices, and that we can change our experiences by changing our choices.

2. I do not fully agree with the text. While it is true that our subjective experiences are influenced by our choices, it is an oversimplification to say that suffering and evil are merely subjective choices. There are objective realities that cause suffering and evil, such as natural disasters, diseases, and human actions. However, I do agree that our perspective and interpretation of these events are subjective and can be influenced by our choices.

3. In God's vast creation, we are but vessels,
Our experiences, choices, not mere coincidences.
Suffering and evil, not objective realities,
But subjective choices, shaped by our beliefs and histories. [end of text]
