Okay, here's a breakdown of the text, focusing on grammar/tense/agreement, serious stylistic issues, and other problems, presented in point form as requested. I've aimed for at least 5 points in each category.  **Please read the "Overall Impression & Recommendations" at the very end after the lists â€“ it's crucial for understanding the tone and potential fixes.**

**I. Grammar, Tense, and Agreement Issues**

1.  **Inconsistent Tense Usage (Paragraph 2):** The shift between past and present tense is jarring. "I briefly wondered whether it *would be* a good idea" (conditional past) followed by "My analysis back then *was* exactly on the same line of logic" (past) is okay, but then "it *seems* their monopolies are still functional" (present) disrupts the flow. Consider maintaining a consistent past tense for the entire recollection of that period.
2.  **Subject-Verb Agreement (Paragraph 2):** "That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they *can* always layoff more people..."  "Layoff" needs to be "layoffs" to agree with the plural subject "more people."  Also, "they can layoff" should be "they can lay off" (needs the preposition).
3.  **Pronoun Agreement (Paragraph 2):** "and I had no ounce of doubt that *they* can cut costs..." "They" refers to META and GOOG. While understandable, it's slightly awkward. Consider rephrasing to "and I had no ounce of doubt that *these companies* can cut costs..." for clarity.
4.  **Incorrect Use of "Line of Logic" (Paragraph 2):** "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic." This is an idiom used incorrectly. It should be "My analysis back then was based on the same line of reasoning/logic."
5.  **Tense Shift (Paragraph 3):** "In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I *would have hated* how I participated..." The conditional "would have hated" feels out of place here. "Hated" is more direct and appropriate.
6.  **Incorrect Use of "In America We Trust" (Paragraph 3):** While intended as a sarcastic aside, the phrasing is clunky. It needs more context or a more natural integration. It feels like a random insertion.
7.  **Verb Form (Paragraph 4):** "Those who read history *knows*..." Subject-verb agreement error. It should be "Those who read history *know*."
8.  **Misplaced Modifier (Paragraph 4):** "This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market)." The phrase "i.e." is a bit clunky and the sentence is long. Consider breaking it up or rephrasing.
9.  **Incorrect Word Choice (Paragraph 5):** "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like..." Should be "what their careers *would look like*."
10. **Tense Inconsistency (Paragraph 5):** "But I always knew we're in a state of flux." Should be "But I always knew we *were* in a state of flux."

**II. Serious Stylistic Issues**

1.  **Overuse of Parentheticals/Asides:** The text is *laden* with parenthetical remarks and asides (e.g., "(There's also a concern...)", "(we're still sane though...)"). While these can add personality, their frequency disrupts the flow and makes the writing feel rambling and unfocused.
2.  **Informal Tone/Language:** The language is *extremely* informal ("shitty," "golden goose," "enshittification," "FI"). While a conversational tone can be appropriate, the sheer volume of slang and casual phrasing undermines the credibility of the analysis.
3.  **Lack of Transitions:** The connections between ideas are often weak or absent. The text jumps between topics without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the argument.
4.  **Excessive Use of Jargon/Acronyms:** While some industry-specific terms are expected, the density of jargon (e.g., "McKinsey Pichai," "equilibrium," "monotonic-increasing") will alienate readers unfamiliar with the context.
5.  **Unnecessary Complexity:** Some sentences are unnecessarily convoluted and could be simplified without losing meaning. The desire to sound intelligent sometimes leads to obfuscation.
6.  **Repetitive Phrasing:** Phrases like "before things break down" and variations of "cut costs" are repeated frequently, making the writing feel monotonous.
7.  **Lack of a Clear Thesis:** While the text touches on several related ideas, it lacks a central, unifying thesis statement. What is the *main* point the author is trying to convey?
8.  **Overreliance on Personal Anecdotes:** While personal experiences can be engaging, the text leans too heavily on anecdotes (e.g., not making trades, living frugally) at the expense of more substantive analysis.
9.  **Inconsistent Voice:** The voice shifts between analytical and confessional, creating a sense of uncertainty.
10. **Unprofessional Tone:** The sarcastic and cynical tone, while potentially appealing to a specific audience, comes across as unprofessional and dismissive.

**III. Other Problems**

1.  **Lack of Specific Evidence:** The claims made (e.g.,
