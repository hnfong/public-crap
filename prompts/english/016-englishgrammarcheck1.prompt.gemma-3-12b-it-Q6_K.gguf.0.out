So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

Okay, here's a breakdown of the text, focusing on grammar/tense/agreement, serious stylistic issues, and other problems, presented in point form as requested. I've aimed for at least 5 points in each category.  **Please read the "Overall Impression & Recommendations" at the very end after the lists â€“ it's crucial for understanding the tone and potential fixes.**

**I. Grammar, Tense, and Agreement Issues**

1.  **Inconsistent Tense Usage (Paragraph 2):** The shift between past and present tense is jarring. "I briefly wondered whether it *would be* a good idea" (conditional past) followed by "My analysis back then *was* exactly on the same line of logic" (past) is okay, but then "it *seems* their monopolies are still functional" (present) disrupts the flow. Consider maintaining a consistent past tense for the entire recollection of that period.
2.  **Subject-Verb Agreement (Paragraph 2):** "That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they *can* always layoff more people..."  "Layoff" needs to be "layoffs" to agree with the plural subject "more people."  Also, "they can layoff" should be "they can lay off" (needs the preposition).
3.  **Pronoun Agreement (Paragraph 2):** "and I had no ounce of doubt that *they* can cut costs..." "They" refers to META and GOOG. While understandable, it's slightly awkward. Consider rephrasing to "and I had no ounce of doubt that *these companies* can cut costs..." for clarity.
4.  **Incorrect Use of "Line of Logic" (Paragraph 2):** "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic." This is an idiom used incorrectly. It should be "My analysis back then was based on the same line of reasoning/logic."
5.  **Tense Shift (Paragraph 3):** "In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I *would have hated* how I participated..." The conditional "would have hated" feels out of place here. "Hated" is more direct and appropriate.
6.  **Incorrect Use of "In America We Trust" (Paragraph 3):** While intended as a sarcastic aside, the phrasing is clunky. It needs more context or a more natural integration. It feels like a random insertion.
7.  **Verb Form (Paragraph 4):** "Those who read history *knows*..." Subject-verb agreement error. It should be "Those who read history *know*."
8.  **Misplaced Modifier (Paragraph 4):** "This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market)." The phrase "i.e." is a bit clunky and the sentence is long. Consider breaking it up or rephrasing.
9.  **Incorrect Word Choice (Paragraph 5):** "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like..." Should be "what their careers *would look like*."
10. **Tense Inconsistency (Paragraph 5):** "But I always knew we're in a state of flux." Should be "But I always knew we *were* in a state of flux."

**II. Serious Stylistic Issues**

1.  **Overuse of Parentheticals/Asides:** The text is *laden* with parenthetical remarks and asides (e.g., "(There's also a concern...)", "(we're still sane though...)"). While these can add personality, their frequency disrupts the flow and makes the writing feel rambling and unfocused.
2.  **Informal Tone/Language:** The language is *extremely* informal ("shitty," "golden goose," "enshittification," "FI"). While a conversational tone can be appropriate, the sheer volume of slang and casual phrasing undermines the credibility of the analysis.
3.  **Lack of Transitions:** The connections between ideas are often weak or absent. The text jumps between topics without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the argument.
4.  **Excessive Use of Jargon/Acronyms:** While some industry-specific terms are expected, the density of jargon (e.g., "McKinsey Pichai," "equilibrium," "monotonic-increasing") will alienate readers unfamiliar with the context.
5.  **Unnecessary Complexity:** Some sentences are unnecessarily convoluted and could be simplified without losing meaning. The desire to sound intelligent sometimes leads to obfuscation.
6.  **Repetitive Phrasing:** Phrases like "before things break down" and variations of "cut costs" are repeated frequently, making the writing feel monotonous.
7.  **Lack of a Clear Thesis:** While the text touches on several related ideas, it lacks a central, unifying thesis statement. What is the *main* point the author is trying to convey?
8.  **Overreliance on Personal Anecdotes:** While personal experiences can be engaging, the text leans too heavily on anecdotes (e.g., not making trades, living frugally) at the expense of more substantive analysis.
9.  **Inconsistent Voice:** The voice shifts between analytical and confessional, creating a sense of uncertainty.
10. **Unprofessional Tone:** The sarcastic and cynical tone, while potentially appealing to a specific audience, comes across as unprofessional and dismissive.

**III. Other Problems**

1.  **Lack of Specific Evidence:** The claims made (e.g.,
