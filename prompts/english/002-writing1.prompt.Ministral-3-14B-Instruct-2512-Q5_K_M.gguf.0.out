**The Little Cloud and the Lonely Pillow**

In a cozy little house at the edge of the village lived an old woman named Clara. She had spent her entire life making things for others—quilts, sweaters, and even tiny wooden birds—but she had never learned to make something just for herself.

One evening, as Clara sat by her window, she noticed a small, silver cloud drifting lazily across the sky. It seemed to be watching her, almost as if it were curious.

*"How strange,"* Clara muttered, *"a cloud that doesn’t just float away."*

The next morning, she found a peculiar object on her windowsill—a soft, embroidered pillow shaped like a cloud. It was warm to the touch, as if it had been sitting in the sun. On it, in delicate stitches, were the words: *"For those who forget to love themselves."*

Clara laughed. *"Who would leave me such a thing?"* But then she noticed something odd—the pillow seemed to *glow* faintly, as if it were alive.

That night, Clara hugged the pillow to her chest and whispered, *"I don’t even know how to love myself."*

The pillow shimmered, and suddenly, the sky outside her window filled with tiny, twinkling clouds—each one holding a memory. One cloud showed her laughing with her grandchildren. Another showed her baking bread for neighbors. A third showed her planting flowers in the spring.

*"You’ve loved so many,"* the pillow seemed to say, *"but you’ve never loved the one who loves you the most—yourself."*

Clara’s eyes welled up. She had spent her life giving, giving, giving—*exaggerating* her own needs so that others wouldn’t worry. But now, she realized, she had forgotten the simplest truth: love begins at home.

She pressed the pillow closer and whispered, *"Thank you."*

The next morning, the pillow was gone. But Clara found a single silver feather on her windowsill—a reminder that love, like a cloud, is always there, waiting to wrap around you if you only let it.

And from that day on, Clara made time for herself—sipping tea in the sun, reading stories, and stitching little notes of kindness… *including one to herself.* [end of text]
