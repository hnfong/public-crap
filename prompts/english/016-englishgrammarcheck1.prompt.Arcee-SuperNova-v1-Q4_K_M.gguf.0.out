Here are the issues I've identified:

**Grammar Mistakes:**

1. "So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..." should be "So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz, which basically says that people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..." (subject-verb agreement)
2. "while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers" should be "while this might seem like an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers" (missing preposition)
3. "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic" should be "My analysis back then was exactly in line with the same logic" (idiomatic expression)
4. "it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down" should be "it seems their monopolies are still functional, and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from them before things break down" (missing comma)
5. "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations" should be "I had no doubt that they could cut costs by almost half without really affecting day-to-day operations" (verb tense consistency, hyphenation)

**Serious Stylistic Issues:**

1. The text jumps abruptly from discussing Andreessen Horowitz's statement to the author's personal investment analysis. A transition sentence or paragraph would help to connect the ideas.
2. The text uses overly casual language and tone, which may not be suitable for a formal or professional audience. (e.g. "I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking", "McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard")
3. The text includes several tangential comments and asides (e.g. "Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance", "we're still sane though, just unique circumstances") that disrupt the flow of the main argument.
4. The text uses overly complex and convoluted sentence structures, which can make it difficult to follow. (e.g. "With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".")
5. The text includes several instances of jargon and technical terms (e.g. "levels.fyi", "FI", "geographically misplaced") that may be unfamiliar to non-expert readers.

**Other Problems:**

1. The text assumes a high level of prior knowledge about the tech industry and its trends, which may not be familiar to all readers.
2. The text includes several unsubstantiated claims and assertions (e.g. "the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over", "every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another") that could benefit from supporting evidence or examples.
3. The text's tone is somewhat inconsistent, veering between critical and resigned. A more consistent tone would help to strengthen the author's argument.
4. The text could benefit from more concrete examples and anecdotes to illustrate the author's points, rather than relying on general statements and abstractions.
5. The text's conclusion feels somewhat abrupt and unsatisfying, without a clear summary or call to action. A more effective conclusion would help to leave the reader with a lasting impression or takeaway. [end of text]
