## The Grain in the Concrete

The chipped Formica of the cafeteria table felt wrong under my fingertips. Too smooth, too…dead. I traced the swirling pattern of the fake woodgrain with a fingernail, a habit I couldn't shake. It reminded me of the living, breathing bark of the Elderwood back home, the one I hadn't seen in seven years. Seven years since my mother, with a sigh that tasted of autumn leaves and regret, had sent me to blend. To *learn* about humans. 

My name is Rowan Blackwood, and I'm sixteen. To everyone at Northwood High, I'm just another quiet kid who prefers hoodies and headphones. They think I'm awkward, maybe a little weird. They don't know I can hear the hum of the fluorescent lights, feel the subtle vibrations of the heating vents, and smell the faint, metallic tang of the rain coming hours before the first drop falls. They don't know my eyes, when the light catches them just right, flicker with a gold that isn't quite human.

Being a wood elf in suburban Ohio is… exhausting. Humans are loud. They move too fast, their emotions spilling out like overripe fruit. They don't understand stillness, the power in waiting, the language of the trees. I spend most of my days mimicking them, forcing myself to laugh at their jokes, nod at their pointless dramas, and pretend to care about football. 

My cover is fragile. I have to suppress the urge to climb the oak tree in the school courtyard, to feel the sap beneath my fingers, to listen to its slow, ancient heartbeat. I have to ignore the way the plastic chairs in history class feel like splinters against my skin. I have to pretend I don't notice the way the janitor's cleaning solution burns my nostrils, a scent that would send any elf reeling.

The worst part is the disconnect. I can't explain why I flinch when someone slams a door, why the smell of gasoline makes my stomach clench, why the constant, artificial light feels like a cage. They just think I'm sensitive. 

My only solace is the small patch of woods behind the school. It's pathetic, really. A few scraggly maples, a choked-off creek, and a chain-link fence separating it from the parking lot. But it's enough. During lunch, I sneak away, pressing my palms against the rough bark of the trees, drawing strength from the faint, wild energy that still clings to the earth. 

Today, I found a small, forgotten patch of moss growing on the north side of a maple. I knelt, tracing the delicate fronds with a calloused fingertip. It smelled like damp earth and forgotten things. For a moment, I closed my eyes, letting the scent wash over me, letting the ache of home settle in my chest. 

"Hey, weirdo," a voice startled me. 

It was Jake Miller, the quarterback, flanked by his two sycophants. He smirked, tossing a crumpled energy drink can at my feet. 

"What are you doing, talking to the trees?" he sneered. 

I forced myself to meet his gaze, keeping my expression neutral. "Just… enjoying the fresh air."

He laughed, a harsh, grating sound. "Fresh air? This is Ohio, dude. The air smells like exhaust and disappointment." 

His friends snickered. I felt my jaw tighten. The urge to snap, to let the ancient power simmering beneath my skin surge to the surface, was almost overwhelming. But I held back. Losing control would blow my cover. 

Instead, I shrugged. "Maybe you just need to look closer."

He scowled, clearly expecting me to cower. But I didn't. I stood up, brushing dirt from my jeans. 

"Whatever," he muttered, turning away. "Just stay out of the way during practice tomorrow. You're creeping everyone out."

They walked off, leaving me alone with the trees. I leaned back against the rough bark, closing my eyes again. The anger still thrummed in my veins, but beneath it, something else stirred. A quiet defiance. 

Maybe blending wasn't about erasing who I was. Maybe it was about surviving long enough to find a way to bring a little bit of the wild back into this concrete world. Maybe it was about letting the grain of the wood show through the cracks in the facade. 

I opened my eyes, the gold flickering just a little brighter. The rain was coming. I could smell it. And for the first time in a long time, I didn't feel quite so alone. The trees were listening. And so was I.
