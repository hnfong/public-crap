In the bustling city of Hong Kong, there's a school named St. Paul's Co-educational College, where I, a teenage student named Li Wei, study. But there's something unique about me - I'm not just a regular human. I'm a wood elf, a secret I've kept hidden from everyone.

Every morning, I wake up to the sound of my alarm, not the chirping of birds like in the forests I'm used to. I live in a small apartment with my human parents, who adopted me when I was a baby. They know my secret, but they've always encouraged me to live as a normal human.

At school, I try my best to blend in. I wear the uniform, attend classes, and do my homework. But sometimes, my elven nature slips out. Like when I accidentally heal a classmate's cut with a touch, or when I sense the emotions of those around me. I always make sure to cover up these incidents, so no one suspects my true identity.

One day, our teacher, Mr. Chan, announced a school trip to the countryside. I was excited, as it reminded me of my elven home. During the trip, we were divided into groups for a nature walk. I was paired with a girl named Mei, who was new to the school.

As we walked, Mei tripped over a root and hurt her ankle. I quickly used my elven healing to help her, but she noticed. "How did you do that?" she asked, her eyes wide with surprise.

I panicked, not knowing what to say. But then, I remembered my parents' advice - to be honest, but careful. So, I told her the truth. "I'm a wood elf," I said, my voice barely above a whisper.

Mei looked at me, her expression unreadable. I braced myself for her reaction, fearing she might reveal my secret. But instead, she smiled. "That's amazing," she said. "I've always wanted to meet an elf."

From that day forward, Mei and I became close friends. She helped me navigate the complexities of human life, and I shared my elven knowledge with her. Our friendship was a testament to the power of understanding and acceptance.

Despite the challenges of living a double life, I've come to appreciate the beauty of both worlds. I'm grateful for the opportunity to experience human life, and I'm proud of my elven heritage. And as I continue my journey, I'm reminded that no matter how different we may seem, we all share the same desire for friendship, understanding, and acceptance. [end of text]
