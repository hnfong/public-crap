My favourite rainbows appear after a summer shower in the countryside. The sky is still a little grey, but the sun peeks through, and suddenly, a bright rainbow arches across the fields. I love the one that appears in the garden behind our cottage. The colours are so clear—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. I like to run outside with my wellies on and look up, wide-eyed. Sometimes, there are even double rainbows! I pretend there’s a pot of gold at the end, and I imagine a friendly leprechaun hiding in the hedges. But the best part is when the rainbow slowly fades, leaving the world sparkling and fresh. Those rainbows make me smile, and I always feel like magic is just around the corner. [end of text]
