The user wants a short story (under 200 words) about rainbows, written in UK English for children. Key requirements:
- UK English (so words like "colour" not "color", "favourite" not "favorite")
- Simple words suitable for children
- Less than 200 words
- From the perspective of a UK writer
- Should describe "the rainbows that you like the most" - so personal, enthusiastic tone

I should create a simple, engaging story that captures a child's imagination. I'll focus on a specific type of rainbow or rainbow moment that would appeal to UK children. Maybe something relatable like after a rain shower, or perhaps something more magical.

Let me think about what makes a rainbow special from a child's perspective:
- The colours
- Where it appears
- The feeling it gives
- Maybe linking it to a familiar UK setting (garden, park, seaside)

I'll write in first person as the writer, making it personal. I'll use simple, descriptive language. I could describe a particular rainbow memory or a favourite kind.

Structure:
- Opening: Setting the scene
- Middle: Describing the rainbow
- End: Why it's special

Word count target: under 200 words.

Let me draft something:

---

My favourite rainbow ever appeared right after a summer shower in our back garden. I was splashing in puddles in my wellies when Mum called out, "Look up!"

There it was, huge and bright, stretching from the old oak tree all the way to Mrs Patel's rooftop. Not just one, but a double rainbow! The main one had all the colours: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. But the second one above it was fainter, like a ghost rainbow.

The colours were so vivid I felt I could touch them. I reached up, but my fingers only caught raindrops. "Can we find the pot of gold?" I asked Dad. He laughed and said the real treasure was the rainbow itself.

What I love most is how rainbows make everything seem magical. The wet grass sparkled, the birds sang louder, and even the worms seemed happier. My little sister said it looked like a giant smile in the sky.

Sometimes I see faint rainbows in the spray from a garden hose, or in the mist by the seaside. But that double rainbow after the storm was the best because it felt like a secret just for our street.

Now whenever it rains and the sun peeks out, I race outside to look. Because the rainbows I like most aren't just pretty arcs – they're promises that even after the greyest day, something wonderful can appear.

Let me check:
- UK English: "favourite" ✓, "wellies" ✓, "back garden" ✓
- Simple words: Yes, suitable for children
- Word count: Let me count... around 90 words. Good, well under 200.
- Tone: Personal, enthusiastic, child-friendly
- Content: Describes a specific rainbow, uses sensory details children would relate to

I think this works well. It's simple, uses UK terminology, and captures a child's perspective. The story has a nice structure and a gentle message. I could maybe expand it slightly to add more colour and detail while staying under 200 words.

Let me refine it slightly to make it flow better and add a bit more detail:

Actually, this version is good. It's concise and child-friendly. Let me double-check the word count more carefully:
