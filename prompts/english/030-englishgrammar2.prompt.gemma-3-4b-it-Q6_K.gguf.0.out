Here are a couple sentences in both Cantonese and English. They are written by somebody who is a native Cantonese speaker, but not necessarily good in English. Review the English translations and suggest modifications, keeping in mind sentences should be simple, fluent, written like a native speaker, and to the point. If the sentence does not need changes, just output the original sentence.

For example:

A. 啲貨咁好賣，唔使慌賺唔到錢喎。 The goods are selling so well, there's no need to fear that you cannot earn money.
B. 美國每四年會舉行一次總統選舉。 The United States will held a presidential election every four years.

Expected output:

A. Suggested sentence: The goods are selling so well, you don't need to worry about not making money.
B. Suggested sentence: The United States holds a presidential election every four years.

Here are the sentences for you to review. In your answer, give one suggested English translation per sentence, or just output the original sentence if no changes are needed.

1. 你咁趕做咩啫，你慌人哋唔等你咩？ Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?
2. 佢份人夠大量，唔同班𡃁仔計較。 He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids.
3. 學語文冇捷徑，要靠大量浸淫。 There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it.
4. 小新喺同事面前讚美女朋友有幾温柔。 Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender.
5. 我日日都搭地鐵返學。 I take the metro to school every day.

Okay, here are my suggested English translations for each sentence, aiming for clarity, fluency, and a natural tone:

1.  **Original sentence:** 你咁趕做咩啫，你慌人哋唔等你咩？
    **Suggested sentence:** “Why are you in such a rush? You don’t need to worry about them not waiting for you.” (or “Why are you rushing? They’re not going to leave you waiting.”)


2.  **Original sentence:** 佢份人夠大量，唔同班𡃁仔計較。
    **Suggested sentence:** “He’s a generous person and doesn’t bother arguing over small things with those who are petty.” (or “He’s a very forgiving person and doesn’t get involved in petty arguments.”)

3.  **Original sentence:** 學語文冇捷徑，要靠大量浸淫。
    **Suggested sentence:** “There’s no easy way to learn a language; you have to immerse yourself in it a lot.” (or “You can’t shortcut learning a language – you need a lot of practice.”)

4.  **Original sentence:** 小新喺同事面前讚美女朋友有幾温柔。
    **Suggested sentence:** “Siu-san complimented his girlfriend in front of his colleagues, saying she was very gentle.” (or “Siu-san praised his girlfriend to his colleagues, describing her as very tender.”)

5.  **Original sentence:** 我日日都搭地鐵返學。
    **Suggested sentence:** “I take the subway to school every day.” (or “I ride the metro to school every day.”)

Do you want me to elaborate on any of these suggestions, or perhaps provide alternative translations? [end of text]
