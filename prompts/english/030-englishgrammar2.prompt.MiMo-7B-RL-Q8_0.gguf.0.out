Okay, let's tackle these sentences one by one. The user wants the English translations to be simple, natural, and like a native speaker. Let's start with the first one.

1. "你咁赶做咩啫，你慌人哋唔等你咩？" The translation given is "Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?" The original has "赶" which is "hurry," but the structure in English is a bit off. Maybe "Why are you rushing?" instead of "hurry." Also, "慌" here is "worry," but the phrase "你慌人哋唔等你咩" could be more naturally translated as "are you worried they won't wait for you?" So the suggested sentence would be: "Why are you rushing? Are you worried they won't wait for you?" That sounds better.

2. "佢份人够大量，唔同班𡃁仔计较。" The translation is "He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids." "份人" is "person," so "He is a magnanimous person" is correct. "唔同班𡃁仔计较" – "班" here might be "class" or "group," and "𡃁仔" is a colloquial term for "kids." "Haggle over trivial issues" works, but maybe "get into trivial arguments with the kids" is more natural. So the suggested sentence: "He's magnanimous, not getting into trivial arguments with the kids." Removing "he doesn't haggle" and using "not getting into" sounds more native.

3. "学语文没捷径，要靠大量浸淫。" The translation is correct: "There's no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it." But maybe "immersion" is better than "exposure" here. So "massive immersion." But the original uses "浸淫," which is correct. The translation is already good, so maybe leave it as is. Wait, the user's example changed "fear" to "worry," so perhaps check if "exposure" needs to be "immersion." The user might prefer "immersion" since that's the term usually used. So suggested: "There's no shortcut to learning a language; the key is massive immersion."

4. "小新喺同事面前讚美女朋友有幾温柔。" The translation is "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender." "喺" is "in front of," so "in front of colleagues" is correct. "讚...有幾温柔" – "praise her for how tender she is." "Tender" is good, but maybe "gentle" is more common. Also, "Siu-san" is a name; in English, maybe just "Siou-sam" or keep it as is. The sentence structure is okay, but perhaps "praising his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her gentle nature." But the user wants to keep it simple. Maybe "praising his girlfriend for how gentle she is in front of his colleagues." Wait, the original says "有幾温柔," which is "how tender" or "how gentle." The translation is okay. Maybe the suggested sentence is: "Siou-sam praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for how gentle she is." That flows better.

5. "我日日都搭地铁返学。" The translation is "I take the metro to school every day." That's correct and natural. No changes needed. So output the original.

Wait, let me check each again:

1. Original translation: "Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?" The user's example changed "fear" to "worry." So the first part should be "Why are you rushing?" and the second part "Are you worried they won't wait for you?" So the suggested sentence would adjust the verbs to present tense and use "rushing."

2. The translation uses "haggle over trivial issues," but maybe "get into arguments" is better. Or "quarrel." But "haggle" is correct for bartering, but maybe "argue over" is better. Wait, the context is with kids, so maybe "argue over trivial matters with the kids." So the suggested sentence: "He's a magnanimous person who doesn't argue over trivial matters with the kids."

3. The translation uses "exposure," but "immersion" is more accurate here. So change to "massive immersion."

4. The translation is okay, but maybe "praise her for being so gentle" instead of "for her being very tender." "Tender" might not be the most common term. "Gentle" or "kind" could work better.

5. No changes needed.

Wait, the user's example for A changed "fear" to "worry," so the translation should reflect that. Let me recheck each sentence.

1. Original: "Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?" The correct structure would be "Why are you rushing? Are you worried that they won't wait for you?" So the suggested sentence would adjust the verbs and structure.

2. "He doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids." Maybe "trivial matters" instead of "issues," but "issues" is okay. Alternatively, "He doesn't quarrel over trivial matters with the kids." But "haggle" is correct if it's about arguing. However, "haggle" usually means bargaining, so maybe "argue" is better. So suggested: "He's a magnanimous person who doesn't argue over trivial matters with the kids."

3. The translation is correct, but maybe "immersion" is better than "exposure." So suggested: "There's no shortcut to learning a language; the key is massive immersion."

4. The translation uses "tender," which is correct, but maybe "gentle" is more natural. So "praise his girlfriend for her gentle nature in front of his colleagues." Or "for how gentle she is."

5. Correct as is.

So applying these changes:

1. Suggested: Why are you rushing? Are you worried they won't wait for you?

2. Suggested: He's a magnanimous person who doesn't argue over trivial matters with the kids.

3. Suggested: There's no shortcut to learning a language; the key is massive immersion.

4. Suggested: Siou-sam praises his girlfriend for her gentle nature in front of his colleagues.

Wait, but the user's example kept the name as "Siu-san" in the translation. So maybe keep the name as is. Also, in sentence 4, the original says "喺同事面前," which is "in front of colleagues." So "praising his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her gentle nature." That's okay.

But let me check the example again. In the example, the user changed "fear" to "worry." So the key is to make the sentences sound more natural, using simpler terms where possible.

For sentence 2, "haggle over trivial issues" might not be the best term. Maybe "get into arguments" or "quarrel" over trivial things. So "He's a magnanimous person who doesn't get into arguments over trivial matters with the kids."

Alternatively, "he doesn't argue about trivial issues with the kids." But "haggle" might be acceptable if it's about arguing over small things. However, "haggle" is more about bargaining, so perhaps "argue" is better.

So revised suggested sentence 2: He's a magnanimous person who doesn't argue over trivial matters with the kids.

Sentence 3: The original translation uses "exposure," but "immersion" is better here. So change that.

Sentence 4: The translation uses "tender," which is correct, but maybe "gentle" is more common. So "praise his girlfriend for her gentle nature."

Sentence 1: The translation's structure is correct, but "hurry" should be "rushing," and "worry" as "worried."

Now, let's write the final suggestions accordingly.
</think>

A. Suggested sentence: Why are you rushing? Are you worried they won’t wait for you?  
B. Suggested sentence: He’s a magnanimous person who doesn’t argue over trivial matters with the kids.  
C. Suggested sentence: There’s no shortcut to learning a language; the key is massive immersion.  
D. Suggested sentence: Siu-san praises his girlfriend for her gentle nature in front of his colleagues.  
E. Original sentence: I take the metro to school every day.  

**Explanation of changes:**  
1. “Hurry” → “rushing” (more natural phrasing).  
2. “Haggle over trivial issues” → “argue over trivial matters” (commoner collocation).  
3. “Exposure” → “immersion” (more accurate for language learning).  
4. “Tender” → “gentle” (commoner synonym; “tender” is less frequently used for describing people’s traits).  
5. No changes needed; the sentence is already simple and natural. [end of text]
