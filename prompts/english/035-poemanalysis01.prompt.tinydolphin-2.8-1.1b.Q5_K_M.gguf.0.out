Inertia is the force that holds an object in place, even when it is moving. In the context of running, inertia is the resistance to change direction or speed when running.

Mario's slip into the abyss is a result of his inability to change direction or speed while running. This is a skill issue, as Mario is not able to adapt to the changing conditions and overcome his inability to move with fluidity. [end of text]
