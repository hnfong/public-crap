So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

Please review this text and point out any grammar mistakes (especially tense and "agreement" issues), serious stylistic issues, or other problems. Do not report minor stylistic/sentence structure issues. Output in list/point form. Identify at least 5 issues in each category.
 [/INST]  Grammar mistakes (especially tense and "agreement" issues):
1. In the first sentence, "So there's a running story" should be "So there's a story running" to correct the tense.
2. In the second sentence, "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something" should be "I can't help but agree that he is probably onto something" to correct the agreement between the subject and the verb.
3. In the third sentence, "In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude" should be "In the end, I didn't make any trades, only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude" to correct the tense.
4. In the fourth sentence, "With interest rates still held 'high', the free money is draining away" should be "With interest rates still high, the free money is draining away" to correct the agreement between the verb and the noun "money".
5. In the fifth sentence, "This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium" should be "This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor market reaches equilibrium" to correct the usage of "supply/demand".

Serious stylistic issues:
1. Throughout the text, the use of parentheses is excessive and makes the text difficult to read. Instead of using parentheses, the author could use commas or semicolons to separate clauses.
2. The text is written in a highly informal and conversational tone, which can make it difficult to understand the author's intended meaning in some places. For example, "I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking" is unclear and could be rewritten as "They are mostly diligent and hardworking".
3. The text jumps between different topics and perspectives without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought. For example, the author switches from discussing the tech industry to discussing their personal financial situation without providing a clear connection between the two.
4. The text uses a number of idiomatic expressions that can be difficult to understand for non-native English speakers or readers who are not familiar with the context. For example, "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose" could be rewritten as "In America, capitalist principles prevail, and they are not likely to harm their profitable enterprises".
5. The text uses a number of technical terms and jargon that may be unfamiliar to some readers. For example, the author uses terms like "antitrust", "monopolies", and "FI" without providing definitions or explanations for these terms.
Other problems:
1. The text lacks a clear structure or organization, with no clear introduction, body, or conclusion.
2. The text is written in a highly subjective and opinionated tone, which can make it difficult to evaluate the author's arguments or conclusions. For example, the author states that "In the end, I didn't make any trades, only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude" without providing any evidence or reasoning to support this conclusion.</s>
