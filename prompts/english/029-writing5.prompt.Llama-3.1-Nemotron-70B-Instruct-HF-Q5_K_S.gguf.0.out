**My Double Life: Branches in the Classroom**

I, Ah-Lam (but my wood elf name is Leafsong), lead two lives. To my classmates at Kowloon High School, I am just another Form 4 student, struggling with math and English (my English still not so good, sorry!). But, under the glow of moonlight, I transform. My hair grows longer and greener, like the bamboo forests of Tai Po. My eyes shine with an emerald sparkle, and my feet bare, ready to dance with the trees.

**Monday Morning**

School bell rings. I rush to my locker, exchanging my worn-out sneakers for a pair of scuffed school shoes. My best friend, Ka-Chun, teases me about my "grandma" hairstyle (he doesn't know about the magical hair growth at night!). We head to our first period: English Literature. I try my best to focus on Shakespeare, but my mind wanders to the ancient elven poems I recited under the stars last night.

**Lunchtime**

In the cafeteria, the aroma of siu mai and har gow fills the air. I sit with Ka-Chun and our friends, discussing the upcoming math test. Meanwhile, I discreetly observe the school's plants, ensuring their well-being. A withering fern in the corner catches my eye. After lunch, I sneak back to water it, whispering a gentle elven spell to revive its spirit.

**Physical Education**

Coach Wong assigns a game of basketball. As I sprint across the court, the wind in my (short, for now) hair, I feel an odd, thrilling connection to the wooden floorboards. My jumps become higher, my shots more accurate. Teammates cheer, puzzled by my sudden athleticism. Little do they know, wood elves are agile and nimble, even in human form!

**Nightfall**

After dinner, under the light of a full moon, I sneak out to the nearby Kowloon Walled City Park. My transformation begins. I stretch, feeling my body harmonize with nature. With a soft glow, my wood elf form is revealed. I practice archery, my arrows made from twigs and leaves, glowing softly in the dark. The park's creatures – fireflies, birds, and the occasional curious cat – gather, watching in silence as I dance, my feet bare, my heart full of joy.

**Back to Bed, Back to School**

As the first light of dawn creeps over the skyline, I return home, transforming back into Ah-Lam. Exhausted but content, I jot down notes for the day's classes and drift off to sleep, dreaming of the forest, my other home.

**Tomorrow, another day, another balance between two worlds.**

P.S. If you see me staring at plants or daydreaming in class, just think I'm... really into botany... yeah. [end of text]
