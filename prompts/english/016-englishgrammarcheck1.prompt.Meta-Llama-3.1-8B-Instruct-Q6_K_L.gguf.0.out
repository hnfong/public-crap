So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

Here are the issues I found in the text:

**Grammar mistakes:**

1. "And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective." - The sentence is a bit convoluted and the phrase "I'm sure are" is a subject-verb agreement error. It should be "I'm sure they are".
2. "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down." - The sentence is a run-on and the verb tense is inconsistent. It should be two separate sentences.
3. "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." - The phrase "McKinsey Pichai" is a non-standard way to refer to Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google. It should be "Sundar Pichai".
4. "The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." - The phrase "In America We Trust" is a non-standard way to refer to the US government or economy. It should be rephrased.
5. "I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift." - The sentence is a run-on and the verb tense is inconsistent. It should be two separate sentences.

**Stylistic issues:**

1. The text jumps abruptly from discussing Andreessen Horowitz's comments to the author's personal financial situation and career concerns. It would be better to connect the two ideas more explicitly.
2. The text uses a lot of jargon and technical terms (e.g. "FI", "monotonic-increasing", "paradigm shift") that may be unfamiliar to non-experts. It would be helpful to define or explain these terms for readers who are not familiar with them.
3. The text has a somewhat negative and cynical tone, which may be off-putting to some readers. It would be helpful to balance this tone with more neutral or positive language.
4. The text uses a lot of colloquial expressions and slang (e.g. "party's gonna end", "fun ride", "geographically misplaced"). While these expressions may be familiar to some readers, they may not be suitable for a formal or professional tone.
5. The text could benefit from more transitions and connections between ideas. Some sentences feel disconnected from the rest of the text, and it's not always clear how they relate to the main argument.

**Other issues:**

1. The text assumes a high level of technical knowledge and expertise, which may not be accessible to non-experts. It would be helpful to provide more context or explanations for readers who are not familiar with the topics being discussed.
2. The text relies heavily on personal anecdotes and opinions, which may not be persuasive or convincing to readers who disagree with the author's views. It would be helpful to provide more evidence or data to support the author's claims.
3. The text uses a lot of rhetorical questions and phrases (e.g. "I mean, people who know approximately how much I make..."), which can come across as insincere or attention-seeking. It would be better to rephrase these questions as statements or to remove them altogether.
4. The text could benefit from more clarity and concision. Some sentences are long and convoluted, and it's not always clear what the author is trying to say. It would be helpful to break up long sentences or rephrase them for greater clarity.
5. The text does not provide a clear conclusion or summary of the main points. It would be helpful to summarize the author's main arguments and takeaways at the end of the text.
