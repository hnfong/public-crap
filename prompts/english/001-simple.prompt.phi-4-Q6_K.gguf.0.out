1. You would have to count up to 1,000 before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number. The number 1,000 is spelled with an "A."

2. The complete sentence is: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." This sentence is famous for being a pangram, which means it contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once.

3. Once upon a time, in a land filled with lush forests and rolling hills, there lived three little pigs and a curious girl named Little Red Riding Hood. The three little pigs, known for their hard work and cleverness, had built their homesâ€”one of straw, one of sticks, and one of bricks.

One sunny morning, Little Red Riding Hood set off to visit her grandmother, carrying a basket of goodies. As she wandered through the woods, she noticed the three little pigs playing near their homes. Intrigued, she decided to stop and chat with them.

"Hello, little pigs," she greeted cheerfully. "What are you doing today?"

"We're just enjoying the sunshine," replied the pig in the brick house. "But we've been having some trouble with a big, bad wolf."

"Oh no!" exclaimed Little Red Riding Hood. "I've heard stories about that wolf. He's quite the troublemaker."

The pigs nodded, their eyes wide with concern. "He's been trying to blow down our houses," said the pig in the straw house. "But he hasn't been able to get into the brick house."

Little Red Riding Hood thought for a moment. "Why don't you all stick together? Maybe you can outsmart the wolf."

The pigs agreed, and they hatched a plan. They would pretend to be friends with the wolf, inviting him over for a visit. Meanwhile, Little Red Riding Hood would go to her grandmother's house and warn her about the wolf.

The next day, the wolf arrived at the pig's homes, expecting an easy meal. But the pigs were ready. They welcomed him with open arms and invited him to their brick house for a feast.

As the wolf entered the brick house, he noticed something was off. The pigs were acting strangely, and Little Red Riding Hood was nowhere to be seen. Just then, the door burst open, and Little Red Riding Hood appeared, holding a basket filled with stones.

"Hello, Mr. Wolf," she said with a smile. "I brought some treats for you."

The wolf, caught off guard, tried to protest, but it was too late. The pigs had already filled his belly with stones, and he couldn't move.

"Thank you, Little Red Riding Hood," said the pig in the brick house. "You saved us."

From that day on, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became the best of friends, always looking out for each other in the forest. And the big, bad wolf learned that trying to outsmart clever friends was a lesson he would never forget. [end of text]
