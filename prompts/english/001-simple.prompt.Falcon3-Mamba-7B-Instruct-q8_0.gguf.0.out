1. The English language spelling of whole numbers typically starts to use the letter "A" at the number 1000, which is "one thousand." However, if you're counting in sequence, you would first encounter "A" in "one thousandth" (1000th), which is the ordinal form of 1000.

2. The sentence "The quick brown fox" is famous because it contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once. It's often used as a pangram for typing practice, proofreading, and font displays. The completion of the sentence is: "jumps over the lazy dog."

3. Once upon a time, in a peaceful forest, there lived three little pigs. The first pig was a bit lazy and decided to build his house out of straw. The second pig was a bit more cautious and built his house out of sticks. The third pig, however, was wise and hardworking, and he built his house out of bricks.

One day, a big bad wolf came wandering through the forest. He saw the first little pig's straw house and huffed and puffed until it blew down. The wolf then gobbled up the first little pig.

The second little pig saw what happened and ran to the third little pig's brick house for safety. The wolf, not wanting to waste time, tried to huff and puff the brick house down as well, but his efforts were in vain. Frustrated, the wolf tried to find another way in. He climbed up onto the roof and dropped down the chimney, but the third little pig was ready for him. He grabbed a pot of boiling water and poured it down the chimney, scalding the wolf and sending him running away.

The three little pigs learned a valuable lesson about the importance of hard work and preparation. They lived happily ever after, knowing they had each other and a safe home to protect them from any future dangers. And they all lived happily ever after. [end of text]
