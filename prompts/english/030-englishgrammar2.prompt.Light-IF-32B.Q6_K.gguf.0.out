Here are the revised English translations for each sentence, keeping them simple, fluent, and natural-sounding:

1. **Suggested sentence**: Why are you in such a hurry? Do you think people won't wait for you?  
   *(Improved flow and natural phrasing: "in such a hurry" is more natural than "hurry", and "Do you think" sounds more conversational than "Why do you worry".)*

2. **Suggested sentence**: He's a generous person—he doesn't argue over trivial things with kids.  
   *(Simplified: "magnanimous" is a bit formal, so "generous" is more natural. "Haggle over" is replaced with "argue over" for better clarity. "The kids" → "kids" for simplicity.)*

3. **Suggested sentence**: There's no shortcut to learning a language—you have to immerse yourself in it a lot.  
   *(Improved: "learn a language" → "learning a language" (gerund for natural flow). "Massive exposure" → "immerse yourself in it a lot" (more natural phrasing for a native speaker.)*

4. **Suggested sentence**: Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for being so gentle.  
   *(Improved: "tender" → "gentle" (more natural for describing personality). "For her being very" → "for being so" (more concise and natural.)*

5. **Suggested sentence**: I take the metro to school every day.  
   *(No changes needed—this is already natural and fluent.)*
