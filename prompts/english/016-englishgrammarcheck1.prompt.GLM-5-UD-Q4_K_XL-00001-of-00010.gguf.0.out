### Grammar Mistakes (Tense and Agreement)

1.  **Incorrect Preposition/Adjective Usage:** "this might seem **to an** unwarranted assault..."
    *   **Correction:** It should be "seem **to be** an unwarranted assault" or simply "seem an unwarranted assault." The word "to" acts as an infinitive marker here, so "an" should not follow it directly.
2.  **Subject-Verb Agreement:** "Those who read history **knows**..."
    *   **Correction:** The subject "Those" is plural, so the verb must be plural: "Those who read history **know**."
3.  **Subject-Verb Agreement:** "...every industry goes through this **phrase**..."
    *   **Correction:** While "phrase" is a noun, it is the wrong word contextually (a homophone error). It should be "**phase**." Additionally, if the subject were singular "every industry," the verb "goes" is correct, but the noun choice is the primary error here.
4.  **Tense Inconsistency:** "...I had no ounce of doubt that they **can** cut costs..."
    *   **Correction:** The surrounding narrative uses past tense ("had," "was"), so the modal verb should also be past tense to maintain sequence of tenses: "...I had no ounce of doubt that they **could** cut costs..."
5.  **Tense Inconsistency:** "People... generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing... But I always **knew** we **are** in a state of flux."
    *   **Correction:** To maintain consistency with the past tense verb "knew," the following verb should be past tense as well: "But I always **knew** we **were** in a state of flux."

### Serious Stylistic Issues

1.  **Capitalization Error:** "...but **In** America We Trust they're capitalist enough..."
    *   **Correction:** The word "In" should not be capitalized mid-sentence. It should read: "...but **in** America We Trust..."
2.  **Missing Preposition:** "...generally have a reasonable expectation **what** their careers would look like..."
    *   **Correction:** This requires a preposition to connect the noun "expectation" to the clause. It should be: "...have a reasonable expectation **of** what their careers would look like..."
3.  **Missing Preposition:** "...in say 15 years..."
    *   **Correction:** While colloquial, this is grammatically incomplete. It should ideally be: "...in, **let's** say, 15 years..." or "...in, **for** example, 15 years..."
4.  **Missing Article:** "...there's actually no tech jobs here..."
    *   **Correction:** In formal writing, "there is" (there's) requires a singular subject. Since "jobs" is plural, it should be: "...there are actually no tech jobs here..." (or "there're," though that is often avoided in writing).
5.  **Punctuation/Run-on Structure:** "That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people..."
    *   **Correction:** Starting a sentence with "That, and..." is informal and creates a fragmented structure. A better construction would be: "Additionally, when shareholders are unhappy..." or combining it with the previous sentence.

### Other Problems (Word Choice/Mechanics)

1.  **Word Choice (Homophone):** "...goes through this **phrase** in some form or another."
    *   **Correction:** The correct word is **phase** (a stage of development), not phrase (a group of words).
2.  **Verb Form:** "...they can always **layoff** more people..."
    *   **Correction:** "Layoff" is a noun (e.g., "the layoff was large"). As a verb, it is two words: "**lay off**." (e.g., "they can always **lay off** more people").
3.  **Missing Article:** "...without really affecting day to day operations."
    *   **Correction:** The idiom requires an article: "...affecting **day-to-day** operations." (Also note the hyphens for the compound adjective).
4.  **Missing Article:** "Saving up for 'FI' isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity..."
    *   **Correction:** While acceptable in casual writing, formally, "Saving up" is a gerund phrase that often sounds smoother as "**Saving** for..." or "**Saving money** for..."
5.  **Punctuation with Parentheticals:** "...(who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking)..."
    *   **Correction:** There is a missing comma after the closing parenthesis to separate the introductory clause from the main clause: "...hardworking**)**, I can't help but agree..." [end of text]
