My favourite rainbows are the ones after a summer shower in the park. The sky is still blue, and the grass is shiny, like it’s wearing a green coat. I like to run through puddles with my little sister, and when we stop, the rainbow is right in front of us, soft and bright. It feels like the sky is giving us a smile. I like the pink and purple bits best—they look like the flowers in Grandma’s garden. When the rainbow fades, we laugh and hold hands, and I feel happy in my heart. Those rainbows are mine and my sister’s secret, and I love them most. [end of text]
