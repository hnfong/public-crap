**The Weight of a Cloud**

In the quiet village of Willowbrook, there lived an old woman named Marigold. She was known for her sharp tongue and her habit of *exaggerating*—though she insisted it was just "colorful storytelling." The villagers often laughed at her tales, but no one knew the truth behind them.

One stormy evening, as rain lashed against her window, Marigold sat by the fire, clutching her favorite *pillow*—a soft, worn thing her late husband had given her. She thought of him often, though she rarely spoke of it. The villagers whispered that she was lonely, but Marigold scoffed. "Love? Bah! Love is just a word for people who can’t stand being alone," she’d say.

But that night, as the wind howled like a hungry beast, Marigold heard a soft knock at her door. She opened it to find a young girl, shivering and clutching a small bundle. "Please, ma’am," the girl whispered, "my mother sent me to you. She said you’d help."

Marigold sighed. "What’s your problem, child?"

The girl’s eyes filled with tears. "My mother’s sick. She says she’s afraid… and I don’t know what to do."

Marigold’s heart, though hardened, softened just a little. She took the girl inside, wrapped her in a blanket, and made tea. As they sat by the fire, the girl spoke of her mother’s fear—not of death, but of being alone. "She says she’s not afraid of dying," the girl said. "She’s afraid of *not being loved* when she goes."

Marigold’s breath caught. She had spent years pushing away the idea of love, believing it was weakness. But now, as she listened to the girl’s quiet courage, she realized something: love wasn’t just a feeling. It was a choice. A promise.

The next morning, Marigold took the girl to the village elder, who helped her mother. But when she returned home, she did something unexpected—she wrote a letter to her late husband. Not of sorrow, but of gratitude. She told him how much she missed him, how much she still loved him, even if she had forgotten how to say it.

That night, as she lay in bed, her pillow soft against her cheek, she looked up at the sky. A single star shimmered through the clouds, and for the first time in years, she didn’t scoff at its beauty. She simply smiled.

Because she understood now: love wasn’t something that faded with time. It was something that grew, even in the quietest of moments. And sometimes, the greatest love wasn’t the one we gave—it was the one we chose to receive.

And that, Marigold realized, was worth more than any *exaggeration*, any *pillow*, or even the heaviest *cloud* in the sky. [end of text]
