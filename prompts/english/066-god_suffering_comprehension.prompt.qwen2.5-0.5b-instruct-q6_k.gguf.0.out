1. The main thesis of the text is that we are vessels for experiencing God's creation, and that we have a subjective experience that is different from what run of the mill consciousness and intelligence can objectively describe. The text argues that we have a subjective experience that is personal and does not involve everything, and that there is a perspective that only a limited subset of reality is experienced. The text also argues that we have desires and wants that seem to conflict with the overall reality substrate, and that we see undesirable things happening and call it evil and suffering.
2. I agree with the text. The text argues that we have a subjective experience that is personal and does not involve everything, and that there is a perspective that only a limited subset of reality is experienced. The text also argues that we have desires and wants that seem to conflict with the overall reality substrate, and that we see undesirable things happening and call it evil and suffering.
3. Here is a short poem based on the information above:

```
In the world of God's creation, we are vessels,
And we have a subjective experience,
That is different from what run of the mill,
And intelligence can't describe.

We have a perspective, a limited subset,
Of reality that we can't see,
And we have desires and wants,
That seem to conflict with the overall.

We see undesirable things happening,
And we call it evil and suffering,
And we choose to believe in or perceive,
Our existence as a subjective choice.
```

This poem captures the essence of the text, which argues that we have a subjective experience that is personal and does not involve everything, and that there is a perspective that only a limited subset of reality is experienced. The poem also captures the idea that we have desires and wants that seem to conflict with the overall reality substrate, and that we see undesirable things happening and call it evil and suffering.
