Bob’s “aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat” is just a fancy way of saying he put **shredded cheese on pizza** (or a pizza-like open-face thing).  
The milk = cheese, tomato purée = sauce, whole-wheat base = crust.  
Calling it “aged organic milk” is technically true, but it’s still pizza—often high in saturated fat and sodium—so while it contains some healthy elements (whole grains, lycopene from tomatoes, calcium from cheese), it’s not exactly the paragon of health food Alice was picturing.  
Hence her “wtf”: the healthy-sounding description didn’t match the greasy reality in the photo. [end of text]
