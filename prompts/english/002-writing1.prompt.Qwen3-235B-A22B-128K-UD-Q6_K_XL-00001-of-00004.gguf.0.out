**The Pillow in the Cloud**

In a quiet village nestled between rolling hills and endless skies, there lived a young girl named Lila. She was known for her vivid imagination and her tendency for exaggerating. If the wind blew a little harder than usual, she’d say a hurricane was coming. If her neighbor’s cat sneezed, she’d claim it had caught dragon fever.

But Lila had a secret. Beneath her bed was a soft, worn-out pillow—one that had belonged to her grandmother, who had passed away the year before. Every night, Lila would hug that pillow and whisper stories into its feathers, hoping somehow, somewhere, her grandmother could hear her.

One evening, as the sun dipped behind the hills and painted the sky in hues of orange and pink, Lila wandered up to the meadow. She often went there to dream, to talk to the clouds, and to pretend that one of them was her grandmother watching over her.

“I miss you,” she said to the sky, her voice trembling. “I know people say you’re in a better place, but I still wish you were here.”

A breeze rustled the grass, and a single cloud drifted closer, soft and round like a pillow. Lila smiled. “Is that you?” she asked, half expecting no answer.

The cloud didn’t speak, but it gently floated down, landing right in front of her. It was the oddest thing—Lila could feel warmth in the air around it, like a hug from the sun itself. She reached out and touched the cloud, and to her surprise, it felt just like her grandmother’s pillow.

From that moment on, whenever Lila felt lonely, she would go to the meadow and talk to the cloud. She told it everything—how her school day went, how her little brother had learned to whistle, how she had baked cookies and burned half of them. She exaggerated, of course—saying the cookies were so bad they could power a rocket back in time—but the cloud just floated there, listening.

Years passed, and Lila grew older. She moved to the city, made friends, fell in love, and built a life. But every now and then, when the sky was clear and the clouds were drifting lazily, she would pause and smile at one in particular.

One day, her boyfriend asked, “Why are you staring at that cloud?”

“Oh, that one,” she said, grinning. “That’s my grandma’s pillow. I used to talk to it all the time when I was little.”

He laughed. “You’re exaggerating again.”

“Maybe,” she said softly. “But sometimes, love leaves behind things we can’t explain. And even if it’s just a cloud, it still makes me feel like I’m not alone.”

And in that moment, she realized that love never truly leaves. It lingers in memories, in objects, in the sky—and sometimes, it feels like a pillow floating on a cloud, holding all the warmth of someone who once held you close.
