Grammar Mistakes:
1. "So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..." - The verb "saying" should be in the present continuous tense to match the context: "are basically saying".
2. "And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers" - The preposition "to" should be "like" to convey the comparison: "And while this might seem like an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers".
3. "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half" - The verb "can" should be in the past tense to match the context: "I had no ounce of doubt that they could cut costs by almost half".
4. "McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard" - The name "McKinsey Pichai" should be "McKinsey & Company" to refer to the consulting firm: "McKinsey & Company is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard".
5. "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose" - The phrase "In America We Trust" should be capitalized as a proper noun: "In America, We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose".
