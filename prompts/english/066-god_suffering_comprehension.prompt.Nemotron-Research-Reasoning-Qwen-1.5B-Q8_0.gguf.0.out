Alright, let's see. I have to answer three questions based on the provided text. The text is a bit dense, but I'll try to parse it.

First question: Explain the main thesis of the text in at most 3 sentences.

Looking at the text, it seems to be discussing the properties of God and the concept of qualia. The main thesis is probably about God's creation and the subjective experience of qualia. So something like "God's properties create everything, and qualia are personal subjective experiences." Maybe also mention the connection between God and the universe.

Second question: Do you agree? Explain concisely.

I need to assess if the thesis is accurate. The text mentions that qualia are personal and subjective, which are beyond objective consciousness. So if someone believes qualia exist, it's a valid point. So I think it's correct. Maybe agree that qualia are subjective and exist.

Third question: Write a short poem based on the information above.

The text talks about God, creation, qualia, subjective experience. Maybe something about creation, personal experience, and the existence of evil or suffering.

Let me structure each part.

For the first question, main thesis is about God's properties and qualia. So something like "God's properties create everything, and qualia are personal subjective experiences."

Second question: agree because qualia exist as subjective experiences beyond objective consciousness.

Third poem: Maybe something about creation, personal choices, and the existence of evil or suffering in subjective ways.

Now putting it all together.

1. The main thesis is about God's properties and the subjective experience of qualia.
2. I agree qualia exist as personal subjective experiences.
3. A poem about creation, personal choices, and the existence of evil.
</think>

1. The text explores the properties of God, emphasizing that God's existence creates everything and introduces the concept of qualia as personal subjective experiences beyond human understanding.
2. I agree with the thesis that qualia, representing subjective experiences, exist beyond objective consciousness, as described.
3. " creation of the universe by God, personal choices shaping existence, and the existence of evil and suffering as subjective experiences. " [end of text]
