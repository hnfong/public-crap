The inertia of running makes Mario slip into the abyss, which is a skill issue. This is because Mario's skill level is not high enough to maintain balance while running at high speeds. To improve this, Mario should practice running on different surfaces and at different speeds to build up his balance and coordination. Additionally, he should use his skills to avoid obstacles and hazards in the game.
