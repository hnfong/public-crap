So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

Grammar Mistakes:
- "saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..." should be revised for clarity and verb agreement, such as "saying that people in big tech companies aren't doing enough real work to justify their existence."
- "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something" - "he's" should be replaced with the proper noun for clarity.
- "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose" - "We Trust" is out of context; it might be better to write "we trust" in lowercase or remove it for clarity.
- "this kind of predatory capitalist attitude" - consider changing "this" to "such," as it is more appropriate when referring to a type or kind of something.
- "besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech" - the verb "is" should be "are" to agree with the plural subject "pockets."

Serious Stylistic Issues:
- The text includes informal language and contractions, which may not be suitable for all audiences. For example, "So there's a running story," "I mean," and "it's obvious by now."
- The text shifts between first-person singular and plural pronouns, which can be confusing. For example, "I" and "we" are used interchangeably.
- There are instances where the author's personal opinions are expressed without clear evidence or sources to back them up. While this may be appropriate in some contexts, it could undermine the credibility of the text in others. For example, "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations."
- The text includes lengthy sentences that may be difficult to read and understand, such as "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard."
- There are no paragraph breaks, which can make the text difficult to read and follow. Consider breaking up the text into shorter paragraphs to improve readability.

Other Problems:
- The text includes abbreviations and acronyms without explanation, which may be confusing for readers who are not familiar with them. For example, "GOOG," "META," and "AI."
- The author uses a mix of technical and non-technical language, which may not be appropriate for all audiences. For example, "product enshittification" and "Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance."
- The text includes a reference to "levels.fyi" without explanation, which may be confusing for readers who are not familiar with it.
- The author includes personal information about their own salary and financial situation, which may be inappropriate or irrelevant to some audiences.
- The text includes a reference to "McKinsey Pichai," which may be confusing for readers who are not familiar with this term. It is unclear whether this is a person, a company, or a product.
