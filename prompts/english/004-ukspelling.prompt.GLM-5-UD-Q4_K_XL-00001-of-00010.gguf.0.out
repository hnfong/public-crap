`
I love the rainbows that come after a storm.
First, the sky turns dark and grey. The rain falls hard. It makes loud noises on the roof. I watch from my window. I wait.
Then, the sun peeks out from behind a cloud. The rain stops. Suddenly, a bright arch of colours appears in the sky. It is beautiful.
I like these rainbows the best. They look like a bridge made of light. I can see red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. They shine over the green fields and the houses.
Mum says you cannot find the end of a rainbow. But I still look for the pot of gold. It is a fun game.
The rainbow does not stay for long. Soon, it fades away. But I feel happy because the sun is back. That is why I like the rainbows after a storm the most. They bring hope and light.
