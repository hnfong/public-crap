### Grammar Issues:
1. **Incorrect use of "Basically"**: "Basically" should not be used to introduce a complex idea or argument. It should be used to simplify or summarize.
2. **Misplaced modifier**: "And while META and GOOG (GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down." - The phrase "it seems" should be closer to the statement it's qualifying.
3. **Ambiguous pronoun reference**: "In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG." - The phrase "it" is unclear; it should refer to "the idea" or "the situation".
4. **Incorrect use of "layoff"**: "In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations." - "layoff" should be "lay off" or "lay off".
5. **Incorrect use of "as a whole"**: "In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they’re capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." - "as a whole" should be "as a whole" or "as one".
6. **Incorrect use of "as well"**: "In the end I didn't make any trades, if only I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they’re capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." - "but" should be "as well" or "also".
7. **Incorrect use of "as one"**: "In the end I didn't make any trades, if only I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they’re capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." - "as one" should be "as well" or "as well".
