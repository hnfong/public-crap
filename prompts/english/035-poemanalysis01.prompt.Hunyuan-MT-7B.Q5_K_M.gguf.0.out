This comment appears to be criticizing Mario in a playful or humorous manner, suggesting that his inability to stop in time while running is causing him to "slip into the abyss." The term "inertia of running" is used metaphorically to refer to the natural tendency of an object in motion to continue moving in that direction unless acted upon by an external force. In this context, it's implied that Mario's lack of quick reflexes or control over his movement is the reason for his downfall.

The comment also suggests that this is more of a "skill issue" rather than a technical or mechanical flaw in the game or Mario's design. It's a common criticism in video game reviews and discussions, where players often joke about their own or others' mistakes or shortcomings while playing.

Overall, the tone of the comment is lighthearted and playful, with a hint of irony or self-mockery. It's likely being shared among fans of the game or similar games, as a way of sharing a humorous observation or expressing a common experience. [end of text]
