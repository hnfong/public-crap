Here are the answers to your questions:

1.  You would have to count to **one thousand** before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number. (The word "thousand" contains the letter "a").

2.  Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox **jumps over the lazy dog**." What is the sentence famous for? It is famous for being a **pangram**, meaning it uses every letter of the English alphabet at least once.

3.  The three little pigs, having successfully outwitted the big bad wolf and built their sturdy brick house, were enjoying a peaceful afternoon. Suddenly, they heard a gentle knock at the door. "Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in!" a sweet voice called. They peeked through the window and saw not a wolf, but a young girl in a red hood, clutching a basket. "Who might you be?" asked the middle pig. "I am Little Red Riding Hood," she replied, "and I'm on my way to visit my grandmother. Could you perhaps point me in the right direction?" The three pigs, feeling safe in their strong home, invited her in for a moment. They listened intently as she explained how she needed to cross the forest to reach her sick grandmother's house. They warned her about the wolf, who might try to trick her, and offered her some fresh vegetables from their garden to take along. With a grateful smile, Little Red Riding Hood thanked the three little pigs and continued her journey, hoping their advice would keep her safe from any lurking danger. [end of text]
