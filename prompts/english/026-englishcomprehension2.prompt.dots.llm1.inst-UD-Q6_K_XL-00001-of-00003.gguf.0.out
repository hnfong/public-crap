yellow

The block we don't know the color of is yellow. Here's the reasoning:

1. Initially, there are 3 black blocks on top of an unknown color block, and beneath them is a blue block. This means the order from top to bottom is: black, black, black, unknown, blue.
2. All blocks are removed, shuffled, and an additional green block is added. The new set of blocks is: black, black, black, unknown, blue, green.
3. After shuffling, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. This means the order from top to bottom is: yellow, blue, and the other blocks (black, black, black, green) are below.
4. Since the yellow block is directly on top of the blue block, the unknown block must be yellow. This is because the only way for yellow to be on top of blue after shuffling is if the unknown block was yellow and it ended up in that position.

Thus, the color of the unknown block is yellow. [end of text]
