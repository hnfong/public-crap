**The Three Little Pigs and Little Red Riding Hood**  

Once upon a time, in a forest not too far from the pigs’ hill, Little Red Riding Hood was walking to her grandma’s house with a basket of bread and honey. As she wandered through the woods, she heard a soft *huff* and *puff* coming from a small hut.  

Curious, she peeked through the window and saw the first little pig sitting on a stool, making bread. The pig looked up and smiled.  

“Hello, Red Riding Hood! Come in! I’m making bread for dinner.”  

Red stepped inside, and they chatted for a while. Then she asked, “Where are your brothers?”  

The first pig laughed. “My brothers built houses too, but they’re strong—made of bricks. I built mine of straw, but it’s cozy enough.”  

Just then, the second little pig walked in, carrying a bag of flour. He greeted Red warmly, and they shared a laugh.  

Later, Red went to visit the third little pig’s house, which was even bigger and sturdier. The third pig was working on a new chair for his living room.  

“Hey, Red! Want to stay for dinner?” he asked.  

Red smiled. “I’d love to, but I have to go to grandma’s. But I’m glad to meet you all!”  

As she walked away, the pigs waved goodbye.  

That night, when Red arrived at grandma’s house, she told her all about the pigs. Grandma smiled and said, “It’s nice to see the pigs making friends. They’re not just builders—they’re kind hearts too.”  

And from that day on, whenever Red visited the forest, she would stop by the pigs’ houses, and they would have tea together.  

And they all lived happily ever after.
