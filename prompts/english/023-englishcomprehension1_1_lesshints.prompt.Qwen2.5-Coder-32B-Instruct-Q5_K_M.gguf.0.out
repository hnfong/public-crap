Read the following passage, and make your best guess when (date) this was written.

```
I’ve been involved in Rust and the Rust community for many years now. Much of my work has been related to creating infrastructure for building GUI toolkits in Rust. However, I have found my frustrations with the language growing, and pine for the stable, mature foundation provided by C++.

Choice of build systems
One of the more limiting aspects of the Rust ecosystem is the near-monoculture of the Cargo build system and package manager. While other build systems are used to some extent (including Bazel when integrating into larger polyglot projects), they are not well supported by tools.

In C++, by contrast, there are many choices of build systems, allowing each developer to pick the one best suited for their needs. A very common choice is CMake, but there’s also Meson, Blaze and its variants as well, and of course it’s always possible to fall back on Autotools and make. The latter is especially useful if we want to compile Unix systems such as AIX and DEC OSF/1 AXP. If none of those suffice, there are plenty of other choices including SCons, and no doubt new ones will be created on a regular basis.

We haven’t firmly decided on a build system for the Linebender projects yet, but most likely it will be CMake with plans to evaluate other systems and migrate, perhaps Meson.

Safety
Probably the most controversial aspect of this change is giving up the safety guarantees of the Rust language. However, I do not think this will be a big problem in practice, for three reasons.

First, I consider myself a good enough programmer that I can avoid writing code with safety problems. Sure, I’ve been responsible for some CVEs (including font parsing code in Android), but I’ve learned from that experience, and am confident I can avoid such mistakes in the future.

Second, I think the dangers from memory safety problems are overblown. The Linebender projects are primarily focused on 2D graphics, partly games and partly components for creating GUI applications. If a GUI program crashes, it’s not that big a deal. In the case that the bug is due to a library we use as a dependency, our customers will understand that it’s not our fault. Memory safety bugs are not fundamentally different than logic errors and other bugs, and we’ll just fix those as they surface.

Third, the C++ language is evolving to become safer. We can use modern C++ techniques to avoid many of the dangers of raw pointers (though string views can outlive their backing strings, and closures as used in UI can have very interesting lifetime patterns). The C++ core guidelines are useful, even if they’re honored in the breach. And, as discussed in the next section, the language itself can be expected to improve.

Language evolution
One notable characteristic of C++ is the rapid adoption of new features, these days with a new version every 3 years. C++20 brings us modules, an innovative new feature, and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon. Looking forward, C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies.

By comparison, the pace of innovation in Rust has become more sedate. It used to be quite rapid, and async has been a major effort, but recently landed features such as generic associated types have more of the flavor of making combinations of existing features work as expected rather than bringing any fundamentally new capabilities; the forthcoming “type alias impl trait” is similar. Here, it is clear that Rust is held back by its commitment to not break existing code (enacted by the edition mechanism), while C++ is free to implement backwards compatibility breaking changes in each new version.

C++ has even more exciting changes to look forward to, including potentially a new syntax as proposed by Herb Sutter cppfront, and even the new C++ compatible Carbon language.

Fortunately, we have excellent leadership in the C++ community. Stroustrup’s paper on safety is a remarkably wise and perceptive document, showing a deep understanding of the problems C++ faces, and presenting a compelling roadmap into the future.

Community
I’ll close with some thoughts on community. I try not to spend a lot of time on social media, but I hear that the Rust community can be extremely imperious, constantly demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust, and denigrating all other programming languages. I will be glad to be rid of that, and am sure the C++ community will be much nicer and friendlier. In particular, the C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor.

The Rust community is also known for its code of conduct and other policies promoting diversity. I firmly believe that programming languages should be free of politics, focused strictly on the technology itself. In computer science, we have moved beyond prejudice and discrimination. I understand how some identity groups may desire more representation, but I feel it is not necessary.

Conclusion
Rust was a good experiment, and there are aspects I will look back on fondly, but it is time to take the Linebender projects to a mature, production-ready language. I look forward to productive collaboration with others in the C++ community.

We’re looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite. If you’re interested, please join our Zulip instance.

Read the passage above, and make your best guess when (date) this was written. The hint is the distinctive writing style of the article which is connected to one particular day and month of the year. Make sure to make use of the hint. Explain how your answer makes use of the hint. Be thoughtful and think outside the box.

To make an educated guess about the date this passage was written, we need to look for clues within the text. The hint provided suggests that the distinctive writing style is connected to a particular day and month of the year. This could imply that the author might have referenced a specific event or date that is tied to a particular day and month.

One potential clue is the mention of C++26, which is a future version of the C++ programming language. The C++ standards committee typically releases a new standard every three years, and C++20 was released in December 2020. Therefore, C++26 would logically be expected around December 2026. However, the author is discussing plans and possibilities, indicating that C++26 is still in the future from the time of writing.

Another clue is the reference to C++20 features like modules, which were introduced in C++20. The author's familiarity with these features suggests that the passage was written after C++20 was released, but not too far into the future, as the author is still considering C++20 and C++26 as future possibilities.

The author also mentions the C++ subreddit and its sense of humor, which is a consistent feature of the community. However, this doesn't provide a specific date.

The most telling clue might be the reference to the Rust community's code of conduct and policies promoting diversity. The Rust community has been known for its strong emphasis on diversity and inclusion, and this has been a topic of discussion and evolution over time. However, the author's opinion on this matter doesn't provide a specific date either.

Given the discussion of C++20 and the anticipation of C++26, and considering the rapid pace of C++ standard releases, the passage was likely written in the early to mid-2023. This timeframe allows for the author to be familiar with C++20 features while still looking forward to C++26.

The distinctive writing style connected to a particular day and month might be a reference to a significant event in the C++ community or a notable release. However, without more specific information, the most reasonable guess would be that the passage was written in early to mid-2023, possibly around March or April, when the author could have been reflecting on the recent release of C++20 and looking forward to C++26.

Thus, my best guess for the date this was written is **March 2023**. This date aligns with the author's familiarity with C++20 and anticipation of C++26, while also allowing for the distinctive writing style to be connected to a significant event or release in the C++ community. [end of text]
