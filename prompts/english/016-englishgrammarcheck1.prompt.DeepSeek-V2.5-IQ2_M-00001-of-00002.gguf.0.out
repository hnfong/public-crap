So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

### Grammar and Tense Issues

1. **Incorrect Tense**:
   - "So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..."
     - The phrase "are not doing enough" should be "are not doing enough" (present tense).

2. **Incorrect Tense**:
   - "And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective."
     - The phrase "might seem to an unwarranted assault" should be "might seem like an unwarranted assault" (present tense).

3. **Incorrect Tense**:
   - "In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG."
     - The phrase "were down" should be "were down" (past tense).

4. **Incorrect Tense**:
   - "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down."
     - The phrase "don't seem to be capable" should be "didn't seem to be capable" (past tense).

5. **Incorrect Tense**:
   - "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard."
     - The phrase "is definitely ready" should be "was definitely ready" (past tense).

### Serious Stylistic Issues

1. **Inconsistent Tone**:
   - The text oscillates between formal and informal language, which can be confusing. For example, "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose" is informal and colloquial, while other parts of the text are more formal.

2. **Inconsistent Punctuation**:
   - The text uses unconventional punctuation in some places, such as "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." This can be confusing and breaks the flow of the text.

3. **Inconsistent Use of Parentheses**:
   - The text uses parentheses in a way that can be confusing. For example, "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023..." The use of parentheses here is unnecessary and can be confusing.

4. **Inconsistent Use of Quotation Marks**:
   - The text uses quotation marks in a way that can be confusing. For example, "This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market)." The use of quotation marks here is unnecessary and can be confusing.

5. **Inconsistent Use of Capitalization**:
   - The text uses inconsistent capitalization, especially in the use of company names. For example, "META" and "GOOG" are not consistently capitalized throughout the text.

### Other Problems

1. **Inconsistent Use of Abbreviations**:
   - The text uses abbreviations such as "META" and "GOOG" without explanation, which can be confusing for readers who are not familiar with these abbreviations.

2. **Inconsistent Use of Technical Terms**:
   - The text uses technical terms such as "levels.fyi" without explanation, which can be confusing for readers who are not familiar with these terms.

3. **Inconsistent Use of Colloquial Language**:
   - The text uses colloquial language such as "the party's gonna end sooner or later" and "we're in a state of flux," which can be confusing for readers who are not familiar with this style of writing.

4. **Inconsistent Use of Slang**:
   - The text uses slang such as "funny stack" and "golden goose," which can be confusing for readers who are not familiar with this style of writing.

5. **Inconsistent Use of Capitalization**:
   - The text uses inconsistent capitalization, especially in the use of company names. For example, "META" and "GOOG" are not consistently capitalized throughout the text. [end of text]
