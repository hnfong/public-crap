### 3. Short Story: The Three Little Pigs Meet Little Red Riding Hood  

Once upon a time, the **Three Little Pigs**—Straw, Stick, and Brick—were happily living in their sturdy brick house when they heard a knock at the door. Outside stood **Little Red Riding Hood**, her basket full of goodies, looking lost.  

*"Oh dear,"* she said, *"I’m trying to reach Grandma’s house, but the Big Bad Wolf is lurking in the woods!"*  

The pigs gasped. *"We know that wolf!"* said Brick. *"He huffed and puffed and tried to eat us too!"*  

Just then, the **Big Bad Wolf** appeared, licking his chops. *"Three little pigs AND a tasty girl? What a feast!"*  

Thinking fast, the pigs and Red hatched a plan. They invited the wolf inside for a "special treat." As he stepped in, **Red swung her basket**, knocking him off balance, while the pigs **boiled a pot of water** in the fireplace. The wolf yelped and fled, never to bother them again.  

From that day on, Red and the pigs became best friends, sharing picnics outside the brick house—always watching for wolves.
