The user wants a story about loss/grieving with less than 10 words. I need to be concise and impactful.

Let me count:
"She still sets the table for him." - 7 words. Good.
"He left. The coffee grew cold." - 6 words. Good.
"Empty chair. Full heart. Silent tears." - 6 words. Good.
"His toothbrush stands alone. She waits." - 6 words. Good.
"She kept his voicemail. Listened daily." - 6 words. Good.

Let me pick one that's evocative and clear about loss/grief.

"She still makes coffee for two." - 6 words. This implies loss through the routine continuing after someone is gone.

Or: "His side of the bed stays cold." - 7 words.

Or: "Her clothes hang. I still smell them." - 7 words.

Or: "Dad's chair remains empty. Sunday continues." - 6 words.

I'll go with something simple and poignant:

"She still sets his place at dinner."

That's 7 words. Clear grief, routine, loss.

Or shorter:
"His coffee cup stays empty."
5 words.

"Her voicemail full. Can't delete."
5 words.

"Empty shoes by the door."
5 words.

I'll provide:
"She still sets the table for him."
7 words. Clear story of loss and grieving through continued ritual.

Actually, let me check the constraint: "less than 10 words" - so 9 or fewer.

"She still sets the table for him." = 7 words. Perfect.

Or even more poignant:
"His toothbrush. Her grief. Morning routine."
6 words.

I'll go with:
"She still makes his coffee. Every morning."
7 words.

Or:
"Empty chair. Full plate. Silent tears."
6 words.

I think "She still sets the table for him" is strong. Or "His side of the bed stays cold."

Let me go with: "She still sets the table for him."

Wait, that's 7 words. Good.

Actually, "His coffee grows cold. She waits." is 6 words and very evocative.

Or: "She kept his sweater. It still smells."

6 words.

I'll provide: "She still sets the table for him."

Simple, clear, heartbreaking.She still sets the table for him. [end of text]
