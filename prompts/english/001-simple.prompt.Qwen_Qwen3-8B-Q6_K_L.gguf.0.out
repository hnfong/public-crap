1. **How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?**

To determine when the letter "A" first appears in the English spelling of whole numbers, we need to look at the words used to spell numbers:

- Numbers from 1 to 20 are spelled out with unique words: one, two, three, ..., twenty.
- Numbers from 21 to 99 are typically spelled with a combination of tens and ones (e.g., twenty-one, thirty-two).
- Numbers from 100 onwards are spelled with "hundred" (e.g., one hundred, two hundred, etc.).

The letter "A" does not appear in any of the words for numbers from 1 to 100. The first time "A" appears is in the word **"thousand"** (e.g., one thousand, two thousand, etc.).

So, the answer is: **You would have to count up to 1,000** before you use the letter "A" in the English spelling of a whole number.

2. **Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox ..."; What is the sentence famous for?**

The completed sentence is:  
**"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."**

This sentence is famous because it is a **pangram** — a sentence that contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once. It is often used to test typewriters, fonts, and handwriting.

3. **Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.**

Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who decided to build their homes. The first pig built a house of straw, the second a house of sticks, and the third a house of bricks. 

One day, the little red riding hood was sent by her grandmother to visit her. She passed by the first pig’s house and was invited in. The pig was very friendly and offered her some porridge. After she left, the big bad wolf came and blew down the straw house. He then went to the second pig’s house and blew that down too. 

The little red riding hood, now on her way to visit her grandmother, met the third little pig on the way. She told him about the wolf and the danger. The third pig, being wise and strong, warned her and helped her escape. 

The wolf, frustrated, tried to find the little red riding hood and her grandmother. But the third pig had built a strong brick house, and the wolf couldn’t blow it down. The wolf tried to trick the little red riding hood into opening the door, but she was clever and outwitted him. 

In the end, the wolf was trapped in the brick house and couldn’t escape. The little red riding hood and her grandmother were safe, and the three little pigs lived happily ever after in their strong brick house.

**The end.** [end of text]
