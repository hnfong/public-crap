So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

Okay, here’s a breakdown of the issues in the text, categorized as requested, with at least five points per category:

**I. Grammar & Tense Issues**

1.  **Inconsistent Tense:** The text frequently shifts between present and past tense without clear justification. For example, “I briefly wondered…” (past) is followed by “My analysis back then…” (present perfect). This creates a disjointed feel.
2.  **Incorrect Verb Agreement:** “Shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff…” – The pronoun “they” doesn’t agree in number with “shareholders.” It should be “shareholders can always lay off…”
3.  **Awkward Phrasing & Verb Choice:** “And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs…” – The phrasing is clunky.  A smoother construction would be, “As evidenced by Google’s (GOOG’s) first round of layoffs…”
4.  **Incorrect Use of “whether”:** “I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea…” – “Whether” is used incorrectly here. It should be “if” – “I briefly wondered *if* it would be a good idea…”
5.  **Unnecessary “really”:** “And I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half *really* without really affecting day to day operations.” – The “really” is redundant and weakens the sentence.
6.  **Incorrect use of “pleases”:** “McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever *pleases* the shareholders…” – “Please” is a verb, “pleases” is a noun. It should be “pleases”.


**II. Stylistic Issues & Tone**

1.  **Overly Conversational & Informal:** The tone is very casual, using phrases like “there’s a running story,” “I’m sure,” “that, and,” and “it’s obvious by now.” This undermines the seriousness of the arguments being presented.
2.  **Repetitive Language:** The phrase “and” is used excessively, creating a monotonous rhythm.  Consider varying sentence structure and using conjunctions more strategically.
3.  **Over-Reliance on Parenthetical Remarks:** The frequent use of parenthetical statements (“(There’s also a concern…)”, “(as a whole)”) disrupts the flow and feels like digressions.
4.  **Cynical & Judgmental Tone:** The author’s consistently negative view of tech companies and their practices comes across as overly cynical and lacking nuance. The phrase “product enshittification” is a particularly strong example of this.
5.  **Unnecessary Self-Referentiality:** The lengthy digression about levels.fyi and the author’s frugality feels irrelevant to the main argument and distracts the reader. It’s a personal anecdote that doesn’t add value.
6.  **Clunky Metaphors:** “ruthless capitalist engine” is a somewhat heavy-handed metaphor that doesn’t quite land effectively.
7.  **Overuse of Absolutes:** Statements like “every industry goes through this phrase” and “True Abundance” are overly broad and lack specific support.

**III. Other Problems & Clarity**

1.  **Lack of Clear Thesis:** While the author expresses a critical view of tech, the central argument isn’t clearly articulated. It’s a collection of observations and anxieties rather than a focused thesis.
2.  **Vague References:** “levels.fyi” and “some funny stack” are not explained, leaving the reader unsure of their significance.
3.  **Redundant Explanation:** The explanation of “FI” (Financial Independence) is unnecessary for most readers.
4.  **Weak Connection Between Ideas:** The transitions between paragraphs are often abrupt and lack logical connection. The shift from discussing layoffs to the author’s personal finances feels jarring.
5.  **Overuse of Jargon:** Terms like “equilibrium” and “enshittification” might be unfamiliar to a general audience, reducing accessibility.
6.  **“In America We Trust” – Tone and Context:** This phrase is loaded and potentially problematic, relying on a specific, and potentially questionable, patriotic sentiment. It feels tacked on and doesn’t contribute to a reasoned argument.



Do you want me to elaborate on any of these points, or perhaps focus on a specific category? [end of text]
