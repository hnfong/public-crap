### Grammar Mistakes  
1. **Tense Agreement**:  
   - "And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault..." → Missing verb: "And while this might seem **to be** an unwarranted assault..."  
   - "I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices" → "would be" is correct, but the sentence feels awkward. Consider rephrasing: "I briefly wondered whether buying some at the relatively low prices would be a good idea."  

2. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:  
   - "In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices" → "it" is singular, but the implied subject is "buying," which is singular. No issue, but could be clearer.  
   - "they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations" → "day to day" should be hyphenated as "day-to-day" (compound adjective).  

3. **Article Usage**:  
   - "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." → "McKinsey Pichai" should be "Sundar Pichai" (his name is misspelled).  
   - "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." → "In America We Trust" is a play on the motto "In God We Trust," but it feels awkward here. Consider rephrasing for clarity.  

4. **Pronoun Reference**:  
   - "The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." → "they're" is unclear—it could refer to regulators or the companies. Clarify.  
   - "I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later." → "the party's gonna end" is informal. Consider "the party is going to end."  

5. **Parallelism**:  
   - "This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium" → "wage cuts/stagnation" is inconsistent. Consider "wage cuts and stagnation" or "wage cuts or stagnation."  

### Serious Stylistic Issues  
1. **Informal Tone**:  
   - "the party's gonna end sooner or later" → Too informal for formal writing. Use "the party is going to end sooner or later."  
   - "we're still sane though, just unique circumstances" → Informal phrasing. Consider "we remain rational, though our circumstances are unique."  

2. **Redundancy**:  
   - "the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone" → "draining away" and "largely gone" are similar in meaning. Combine for conciseness: "the free money is draining away as promises of revolutionary tech fade."  

3. **Overly Complex Sentences**:  
   - "That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations." → Too long and convoluted. Split into shorter sentences.  

4. **Awkward Phrasing**:  
   - "Saving up for 'FI' isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry" → "FI" is unclear without context. Define it or rephrase.  

5. **Lack of Clarity**:  
   - "my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses" → "funny stack" is vague. Specify what "stack" means (e.g., programming languages, tools).  

### Other Problems  
1. **Misplaced Modifier**:  
   - "With interest rates still held 'high', the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone..." → The placement of "high" in quotes is odd. Consider rephrasing: "With 'high' interest rates persisting, the free money is draining away..."  

2. **Contradiction**:  
   - "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations" → Contradicts earlier skepticism about the companies' ability to innovate. Clarify the stance.  

3. **Cultural Reference**:  
   - "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose" → The reference to "In God We Trust" is unclear. Either explain it or avoid.  

4. **Logical Flow**:  
   - The paragraph about layoffs and wage cuts doesn't clearly connect to the earlier discussion about monopolies and profitability. Add transitions for coherence.  

5. **Ambiguity**:  
   - "the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium" → "equilibrium" is vague. Specify what this means (e.g., wages stabilize, unemployment drops).  

### Summary of Key Issues  
1. **Grammar**: Missing verbs, hyphenation, article usage, pronoun clarity, parallelism.  
2. **Style**: Informal tone, redundancy, overly complex sentences, awkward phrasing, lack of clarity.  
3. **Other**: Misplaced modifiers, contradictions, cultural references, logical flow, ambiguity.
