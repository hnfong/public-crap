<think>Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one. Starting with the first one: How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?

Hmm, so the question is asking when the letter A appears in the English words for numbers. Let me think. Numbers from one onwards. Let's list them out mentally. One, two, three... up to twenty, then thirty, forty, etc. Let's check each number's spelling to see where the first A appears.

Starting from 1: One (no A), two (no A), three (no A), four (no A), five (no A), six (no A), seven (no A), eight (no A), nine (no A), ten (no T-E-N, so T-E-N, no A). Then eleven (E-L-L-E-V-E-N, no A), twelve (T-W-E-L-T-E-E, no A). Thirteen (T-H-I-R-T-E-E-N, no A). Fourteen (F-O-U-R-T-E-E-N, no A). Fifteen (F-I-F-T-E-E-N, no A). Sixteen (S-I-X-T-E-E-N, no A). Seventeen (S-E-V-E-N-T-E-E-N, no A). Eighteen (A-H-E-I-G-H-T-E-E-N? Wait, eighteen is E-I-G-H-T-E-E-N. Wait, no, eighteen is spelled E-I-G-H-T-E-E-N. Wait, actually, let me check again. Eighteen: E-I-G-H-T-E-E-N. No A there. Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's go to twenty: T-W-E-N-T-Y. No A. Twenty-one: T-W-E-N-T-Y-O-N. No A. Twenty-two: T-W-E-N-T-Y-T-W-O. No A. Hmm. Wait, maybe when we get to numbers like thirty, forty, etc. Wait, thirty is T-H-I-R-T-Y. No A. Forty is F-O-U-R-T-Y. No A. Fifty: F-I-F-T-Y. No A. Sixty: S-I-X-T-Y. No A. Seventy: S-E-V-E-N-T-Y. No A. Eighty: E-I-G-H-T-Y. No A. Ninety: N-I-N-E-T-Y. No A. Then we get to numbers like one hundred: O-N-E H-U-N-D-R-E-D. No A. One hundred and one: O-N-E H-U-N-D-R-E-D A-N-D O-N-E. Wait, here we have an A in "and". But wait, in British English, when writing numbers like 101, it's "one hundred and one", which includes the word "and". So the letter A would appear in "and". But the question is about the spelling of a whole number. So if the number is written out as a single word without "and", then maybe we need to find the first number that has an A in its name without using "and".

Wait, let's check numbers again. Let's go back to the teens. Wait, maybe I missed a number. Let's see: eleven, twelve, thirteen... up to nineteen. Nineteen: N-I-N-T-E-E-N. No A. So the first A would be in which number? Let's check numbers beyond twenty. Maybe when we get to numbers like... Hmm. Let's think of numbers like "forty" (no A), "fifty" (no A), "sixty" (no A), "seventy" (no A), "eighty" (no A), "ninety" (no A). Then one hundred (no A). One hundred one: "onehundredone" if written without "and", but that's not standard. Wait, maybe in some other number. Wait, perhaps in the word "two" or "three"? No. Wait, maybe in "eighty"? No. Wait, maybe I'm missing a number. Let's check numbers from one to a hundred. Let's list some more:

21: twenty-one (no A), 22: twenty-two (no A), 23: twenty-three (no A), 24: twenty-four (no A), 25: twenty-five (no A), 26: twenty-six (no A), 27: twenty-seven (no A), 28: twenty-eight (no A), 29: twenty-nine (no A). 30: thirty (no A), 31: thirty-one (no A), etc. 40: forty (no A), 41: forty-one (no A). 50: fifty (no A), 51: fifty-one (no A). 60: sixty (no A), 61: sixty-one (no A). 70: seventy (no A), 71: seventy-one (no A). 80: eighty (no A), 81: eighty-one (no A). 90: ninety (no A), 91: ninety-one (no A). 100: one hundred (no A), 101: one hundred and one (has an A in "and"). But if we write 101 without "and", like "onehundredone", then there's no A. But standard English uses "and". So maybe the first number that has an A in its name without using "and" is... Hmm. Wait, maybe in the word "eight" itself? No, eight is E-I-G-H-T. No A. Wait, maybe in "eleven"? No. Wait, perhaps I'm missing a number. Let me check the numbers again. Wait, maybe when we get to numbers like "seventy" (no A), "eighty" (no A), "ninety" (no A). Wait, maybe the first occurrence is in the word "two" but no. Wait, perhaps the answer is that you have to count up to 100, but that doesn't have an A. Wait, maybe the answer is that the letter A first appears in the word "and", which is used in numbers like 101. But the question says "the English language spelling of a whole number". So if the number is written as a single word without "and", then maybe the first number with an A is... Wait, perhaps in the word "one" there's no A. Wait, maybe the answer is that you have to count up to 100, but that's not correct. Wait, maybe I'm missing a number. Let me check the numbers again. Wait, let's think of numbers like "four" (no A), "five" (no A), "six" (no A), "seven" (no A), "eight" (no A), "nine" (no A), "ten" (no A). Then "eleven" (no A), "twelve" (no A), "thirteen" (no A), "fourteen" (no A), "fifteen" (no A), "sixteen" (no A), "seventeen" (no A), "eighteen" (no A), "nineteen" (no A). Then twenty (no A), twenty-one (no A), ..., up to ninety-nine (no A). Then one hundred (no A). One hundred one: "onehundredone" would be written as onehundredone, but in standard English, it's one hundred and one. So the "and" introduces an A. But if we consider numbers written without "and", then maybe the first occurrence is in the word "two" but no. Wait, perhaps the answer is that the letter A first appears in the word "and", which is part of the number's spelling when using "and". So the first number that requires an A is 101, because when you write it out, you need "and", which has an A. But wait, the question is about the spelling of the whole number. So if the number is written as a single word without "and", then maybe there's no A until... Wait, maybe there's a number that inherently has an A in its name. Let me check again. Let's go through numbers from one to, say, 200. Wait, maybe in the word "eighty"? No. Wait, "eighty" is E-I-G-H-T-Y. No A. " ninety" is N-I-N-E-T-Y. No A. "one hundred" is O-N-E H-U-N-D-R-E-D. No A. "two hundred" is T-W-O H-U-N-D-R-E-D. No A. "three hundred" is T-H-R-E-E H-U-N-D-R-E-D. No A. Wait, maybe when we get to numbers like "thousand". One thousand: O-N-E T-H-O-U-S-A-N-D. Wait, here we have an A in "thousand". So "one thousand" would have an A. But the question is about a whole number. So if we write "one thousand", that's a whole number, and it contains the letter
