1. The first time you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number is when you reach the number "one thousand". The word "and" is not considered as it is not used in the formal spelling of numbers.

2. The sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is famous for containing every letter of the English alphabet. It is often used as a pangram, which is a sentence that contains all the letters of the alphabet, to test typewriters, computer keyboards, and fonts.

3. Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived three little pigs who had built their houses out of straw, sticks, and bricks. One sunny day, as they were out in the forest gathering food, they met Little Red Riding Hood, who was on her way to her grandmother's house.

The pigs were surprised to see a little girl in the woods, but they welcomed her with open arms. They told her about their houses and how the big bad wolf had tried to blow them down. Little Red Riding Hood was fascinated by their story and asked if she could visit their houses.

The pigs agreed, and they all went to the house made of straw first. The wolf had already blown it down, so they moved on to the house made of sticks. The wolf had also blown that one down, but the house made of bricks was still standing strong. They all went inside and enjoyed a delicious meal together.

As the sun began to set, Little Red Riding Hood said goodbye to the pigs and continued on her way to her grandmother's house. The pigs waved goodbye and wished her a safe journey. From that day on, they became good friends and would often visit each other in the forest. The end. [end of text]
