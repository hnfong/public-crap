In this scenario, Bob ate a dish that is not considered healthy. Here's what happened:

- **What Bob ate**: He ate **aged organic milk** tossed with **seasoned tomato purée** spread on **baked whole wheat**.
- **Was it healthy?**: No, it is **not healthy**. The combination of aged organic milk (which may still be high in calories and fat), seasoned tomato purée (which is often high in sodium and spices), and baked whole wheat (which is a good source of fiber and nutrients) does not make for a healthy meal. The dish is likely high in sodium, fat, and calories, and lacks essential nutrients like vitamins and minerals.

So, the answer is: **Bob ate a high-calorie, high-sodium, and high-fat dish that is not healthy.** [end of text]
