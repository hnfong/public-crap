### **Grammar Mistakes (Tense & Agreement Issues)**

1. **"who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking"**  
   - The relative clause "who I'm sure are..." is grammatically correct, but the phrasing is slightly awkward. A smoother version would be "who I’m sure are mostly diligent and hardworking people."

2. **"it seems their monopolies are still functional"**  
   - "Monopolies" (plural) is used, but the context suggests referring to each company’s dominance (singular). Should be "monopoly is still functional" (or rephrase to avoid ambiguity).

3. **"they can always layoff more people"**  
   - "Layoff" should be hyphenated as "lay off" (verb form) or "layoffs" (noun). Correct: "lay off more people."

4. **"I had no ounce of doubt"**  
   - "Ounce" is incorrect; should be "not an ounce of doubt" (correct idiom).

5. **"McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready"**  
   - "McKinsey" is likely a typo for "McKinsey & Company" (consulting firm), but the phrasing is unclear. Possibly meant "Pichai (CEO of Google) is definitely ready," but the comma splice makes it awkward. Should restructure.

### **Serious Stylistic Issues**

1. **Inconsistent tone shifts (casual vs. formal)**  
   - Phrases like "the party’s gonna end" and "In America We Trust" clash with otherwise analytical writing. The mix of slang ("gonna," "shitty") and ironic capitalization ("We Trust") undermines professionalism.

2. **Overuse of parentheses and asides**  
   - Excessive parenthetical remarks (e.g., "(GOOG mainly)", "(as a whole)", "(we're still sane though...)") disrupt flow. These should be integrated or removed for clarity.

3. **Ambiguous pronoun references**  
   - "Those who read history knows" → "know" should be "know" (plural agreement), but the phrase is awkward. Better: "Anyone who knows history..."

4. **Vague or hyperbolic claims**  
   - "tech companies can fail REALLY fast" → Overly informal and lacks nuance. Replace with "tech companies can fail rapidly" for seriousness.
   - "predatory capitalist attitude" → Loaded language; consider "profit-driven strategies" for objectivity.

5. **Run-on sentences and comma splices**  
   - Example: "In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year... I briefly wondered..." → The clause after the em dash is a full sentence, making it a comma splice if replaced with a comma. Restructure or use a period.

### **Other Problems (Clarity, Logic, Consistency)**

1. **"levels.fyi or otherwise"**  
   - Awkward phrasing. Better: "levels.fyi or other sources."

2. **"FI" undefined**  
   - "Saving up for 'FI'" assumes reader familiarity with "Financial Independence." Spell out the term first (e.g., "Financial Independence (FI)").

3. **Contradictory stance on "predatory capitalism"**  
   - The author condemns "predatory capitalist attitude" but admits the logic is "solid." This tension isn’t resolved, making the position unclear. Clarify whether this is ironic critique or genuine concern.

4. **"Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn’t True Abundance"**  
   - Capitalizing "True Abundance" is unnecessary unless defined as a term. Lowercase unless it’s a coined concept.

5. **"geographically misplaced"**  
   - Uncommon phrasing. Better: "geographically isolated" or "in an area with no tech jobs."

6. **"small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is..."**  
   - "Is" disagrees with "pockets" (plural). Should be "are." Also, "currently" is redundant after "in practice."

7. **"ruthless capitalist engine is taking over"**  
   - Metaphor is vivid but overly dramatic. Consider "profit-driven mechanisms" for consistency with earlier tone.

8. **"monotonic-increasing"**  
   - Hyphenation error. Correct: "monotonically increasing."

9. **"in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses"**  
   - Informal and dismissive. Replace with "niche technology stack" for neutrality.

10. **Missing article/flow in conclusion**  
    - The ending ("The party’s gonna end... survival necessity") feels abrupt. A smoother transition from industry trends to personal finance would help.
