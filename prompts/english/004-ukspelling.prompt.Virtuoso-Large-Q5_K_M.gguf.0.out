In the small village of Willowbrook, where the skies often wept gentle tears, there was a special rainbow that appeared after every rain. It wasn’t just any rainbow; it was the most magical one little Lily had ever seen.

One rainy afternoon, Lily put on her wellies and dashed outside. As the rain stopped, a brilliant arc of colours stretched across the sky. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—each stripe was brighter and clearer than the last. But what made this rainbow special was a tiny, shimmering bridge that seemed to connect the rainbow to the ground, right in front of Lily’s house.

Lily walked up to the bridge, and as she stepped onto it, the world around her sparkled. She felt a warm, gentle breeze, and the colours of the rainbow danced around her. For a moment, she felt like she could touch the sky.

When she returned home, the rainbow faded, but the memory stayed with her. Every time it rained, Lily looked forward to seeing her magical rainbow and the bridge that led to a world of wonder. [end of text]
