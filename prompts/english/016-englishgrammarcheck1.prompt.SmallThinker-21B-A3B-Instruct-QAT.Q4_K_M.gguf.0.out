### **Grammar Mistakes (Tense/Agreement Issues)**  
1. **"Andreessen Horowitz"** – The name is written without a space, which is incorrect (should be "Andreessen Horowitz").  
2. **"they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down"** – "they" (plural) and "they" (singular) create a tense/number agreement issue.  
3. **"I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half"** – "they" (plural) and "they" (singular) create a tense/number agreement issue.  
4. **"the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial 'efficiency'"** – "is" (singular) vs. "engine" (plural) creates a subject-verb agreement issue.  
5. **"the party’s gonna end sooner or later"** – "gonna" is informal and not standard in formal writing.

### **Serious Stylistic Issues**  
1. **"In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose"** – The phrase "In America We Trust" is a cliché and lacks originality.  
2. **"the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial 'efficiency'"** – "ruthless capitalist engine" is overly dramatic and lacks nuance.  
3. **"product enshittification"** – The term "enshittification" is informal and may not be appropriate for the intended audience.  
4. **"the party’s gonna end sooner or later"** – The phrase is colloquial and lacks the gravity of the topic.  
5. **"I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years"** – The phrasing "say 15 years" is awkward and could be rephrased for clarity.

### **Additional Notes**  
- The text contains **repetitive phrasing** (e.g., "the party’s gonna end sooner or later") and **overuse of informal language** ("gonna," "fun ride").  
- The **tone shifts abruptly** between analytical and casual, which may confuse the reader.  
- **Technical jargon** ("enshittification," "monopolies") is used without sufficient explanation, which could alienate some readers.  
- **Historical references** (e.g., "every industry goes through this phrase") are vague and lack specific examples.  
- **Geographical and technical context** (e.g., "no tech jobs here") is mentioned but not fully integrated into the broader argument. [end of text]
