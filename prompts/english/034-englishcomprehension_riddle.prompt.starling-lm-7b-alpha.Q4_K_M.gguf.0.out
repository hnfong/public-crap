Consider this scenario:

Alice: Are you eating healthy?
Bob: Yes! Today I ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat.
Alice: Wow! Let me see.
Bob: (sends Alice a photo)
Alice: wtf

Question: what happened? What did Bob eat and was it healthy?

Bob ate aged organic milk, seasoned tomato purée, and baked whole wheat. It's unclear whether the food was healthy or not, but it was certainly unusual.
