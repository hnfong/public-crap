A skilled artisan, Marco, in 15th-century Florence, is commissioned to create a reliquary for a powerful local family, the Albizzi. The commission stipulates the use of specific, rare lapis lazuli sourced from a particular mine controlled by a rival family, the Medici. Marco knows that acquiring this lapis lazuli will almost certainly require him to secretly negotiate with a Medici agent, potentially incurring the wrath of the Albizzi if discovered. Furthermore, the Albizzi are known for their ruthless enforcement of contracts and their tendency to punish perceived disloyalty severely.

Under the prevailing norms of Florentine Renaissance society – including concepts like *clientela*, *virtù*, and the importance of maintaining *reputazione* – what is the most strategically prudent course of action for Marco, and *why*? Assume Marco’s primary goal is to both fulfill the commission successfully *and* protect his long-term livelihood and standing within Florentine society.

Marco should secretly negotiate with a Medici agent to acquire the lapis lazuli. This is the most strategically prudent course of action for Marco because it allows him to fulfill the commission successfully and protect his long-term livelihood and standing within Florentine society. If Marco were to refuse the commission or attempt to acquire the lapis lazuli without the Medici's help, he would likely face severe consequences from the Albizzi, including punishment for perceived disloyalty. Additionally, maintaining a positive relationship with the Medici is important for Marco's reputation and success in Florentine society. [end of text]
