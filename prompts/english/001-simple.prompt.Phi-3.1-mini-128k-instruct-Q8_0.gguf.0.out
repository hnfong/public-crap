One day, while constructing their homes, they heard a rustling in the nearby woods. Curious, they decided to investigate and stumbled upon a little red riding hood.


The little red riding hood, whose name was Rosie, was on her way to visit her grandmother's house. As she walked through the woods, she noticed the three little pigs and greeted them with a warm smile. The pigs, who were always on the lookout for adventure, invited Rosie to join them on a journey to visit her grandmother.


As they walked, the pigs shared stories of their adventures and the challenges they faced while building their houses. Rosie listened intently and shared her own tales of the forest and the creatures she encountered. The three little pigs were fascinated by Rosie's stories and realized that they had much to learn from her.


When they finally arrived at Rosie's grandmother's house, they were amazed by the beauty of the garden and the delicious smell of freshly baked apple pies. Rosie's grandmother welcomed them with open arms and shared a warm meal with them. As they sat around the table, the three little pigs realized that they had made a new friend in Rosie.


From that day on, the three little pigs and Rosie the little red riding hood became the best of friends. They continued to share stories and adventures, and their friendship grew stronger with each passing day. And so, the three little pigs learned that sometimes, the most unexpected friendships can bring the greatest joy and happiness. [end of text]
