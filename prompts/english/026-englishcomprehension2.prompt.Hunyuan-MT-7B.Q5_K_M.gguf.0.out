The answer is **Black**.

Explanation:
1. Initially, there are 3 black blocks on top of a block of unknown color and a blue block below them.
2. We remove all the blocks and add a green block, then put them back on top of each other in any order.
3. Since the yellow block is on top of the blue block, it must have been one of the original black blocks that were removed and then added back.
4. Therefore, the block of unknown color is one of the two remaining black blocks. [end of text]
