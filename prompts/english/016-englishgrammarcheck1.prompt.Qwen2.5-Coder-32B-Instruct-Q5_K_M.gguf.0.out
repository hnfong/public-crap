### Grammar Mistakes

1. **Tense and Agreement Issues:**
   - "And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers" should be "And while this might seem like an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers."
   - "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs" should be "I had no doubt that they could cut costs."
   - "McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready" should be "Pichai is definitely ready" (assuming McKinsey is a consultancy and not part of Pichai's name).
   - "The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough" should be "The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but in America, they're capitalist enough."
   - "Those who read history knows" should be "Those who read history know."

### Serious Stylistic Issues

1. **Clarity and Precision:**
   - "META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG)" is redundant and unclear. It should be "META and especially GOOG."
   - "they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down" is vague. It could be clearer as "they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from their monopolies before their business model collapses."
   - "free money is draining away" is unclear. It could be more precise as "cheap capital is becoming scarce."
   - "besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech" is confusing. It should be "besides small pockets of AI, which is currently operationally much less significant than general tech."
   - "product enshittification" is a colloquial term and may not be appropriate for formal writing. Consider using "product degradation" or "product decline."

### Other Problems

1. **Logical and Factual Issues:**
   - "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose" is a logical leap. It assumes that American capitalism inherently protects monopolies, which is not always the case.
   - "saving up for 'FI' isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity" implies that financial independence is not an aspiration, which is a strong statement and may not be universally true.
   - "we're still sane though, just unique circumstances" is vague and unclear. It could be more precise as "we're still operating rationally, just in unique circumstances."
   - "there's actually no tech jobs here" is a broad statement. It should be more specific, such as "there are no tech jobs in this area."
   - "my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses" is subjective and could be more constructive as "my technical expertise is in a niche stack that is not widely used." [end of text]
