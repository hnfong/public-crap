Let's tackle each question one by one:

### 1. How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?

To answer this, we need to consider the English spelling of numbers. The letter "A" appears in the spelling of numbers in the thousands and higher. For example, "one thousand" and "ten thousand" both contain the letter "A". 

The first number that uses the letter "A" in its English spelling is **ten thousand** (10,000). Therefore, you would have to count up to **ten thousand** before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number.

### 2. Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox ..."; What is the sentence famous for?

The sentence "The quick brown fox ... " is famous because it contains every letter of the English alphabet. It is often used as a memorable example in language and typing tutorials.

### 3. Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.

Here's a short story for the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood:

---

Once upon a time, in a cozy little village, lived three little pigs. The first pig, named Peter, built his house of sticks. The second pig, named Paul, constructed his house of sticks and straw. The third pig, named Pauline, built her house of sticks, straw, and bricks.

One sunny day, Little Red Riding Hood, a kind and gentle girl, decided to visit her sick grandmother. She met the three little pigs on her way. 

"Hello, little pigs," she said with a smile. "I'm Little Red Riding Hood. I'm on my way to visit my grandmother."

The pigs were delighted to meet her. They invited her to their houses to rest and have a snack.

In the first pig's house, they enjoyed a simple meal of bread and honey. In the second pig's house, they had a feast of bread, honey, and cheese. In the third pig's house, they had a grand meal of bread, honey, cheese, and a juicy apple.

After their meal, Little Red Riding Hood and the pigs talked about their adventures and the importance of hard work and safety. They all agreed that Pauline's house was the safest and most comfortable.

As the sun began to set, Little Red Riding Hood said goodbye to the pigs and continued her journey to her grandmother's house. She was safe and happy, knowing that she had met such kind and friendly animals.
