My name is Lin Wei, and I am a sixteen-year old student at Kwun Tong Maryknoll Secondary School. To my classmates, I am just another quiet student who likes to sit by the window and draw in my notebook. They don’t know that I am not really like them. I am not fully human. I am a wood elf.

My parents came from the deep forests far away from Hong Kong, but they moved here when I was very small. They wanted me to have a better life and to learn the ways of humans. They taught me how to hide my pointed ears under my hair, how to walk without making the leaves dance, and how to pretend that I don’t hear the whisper of the trees calling my name.

At school, I try to be normal. I wear the same uniform as everyone else, eat the same lunch, and study for the same math tests. But sometimes, it is hard. The air in the city feels heavy and dry to me. I get headaches when the fluorescent lights are too bright, and I always feel a little lonely when everyone is laughing loudly in the canteen.

After school, I go to the park near our apartment. There, the old banyan tree stands tall and strong. When no one is looking, I touch its bark and whisper in the old language of my people. The tree listens, and I feel my spirit calm down. Sometimes, I think I see shadows moving in the leaves, and I wonder if it is my imagination or if other wood elves are nearby, hiding like me.

One day, my friend Jenny noticed me sitting under the banyan tree during recess. She asked me why I always choose that spot.

“I like the shade,” I said, which was true, but not the whole truth.

She sat next to me and smiled. “You know, you’re really good at drawing trees. They look alive in your sketches.”

I felt a little shy. “Thank you. I just like trees.”

Jenny didn’t say anything else, but she didn’t laugh or make fun of me. I liked that about her.

That night, I drew a picture of the banyan tree and the two of us sitting under it. I added tiny green lights in the leaves, the way I remember from home, where the trees would glow softly at night. I kept the picture in my notebook, hidden between my math homework.

Sometimes I wonder if I will ever tell anyone the truth. But for now, I am happy just being Lin Wei, the quiet student who loves trees, and sometimes, when the wind is just right, I can almost hear the forest calling me home. [end of text]
