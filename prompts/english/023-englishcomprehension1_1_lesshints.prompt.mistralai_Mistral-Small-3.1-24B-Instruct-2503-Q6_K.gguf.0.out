The passage contains several clues that help to narrow down the timeframe when it was written. However, the distinctive writing style and the hint about a particular day and month of the year are crucial for pinpointing the exact date.

### Key Clues:
1. **Mention of C++20 and C++26**: C++20 was released in December 2020, and C++26 is expected to be released in 2026. The author mentions looking forward to features in C++26, which suggests the passage was written after C++20 was released but before C++26 was finalized.
2. **Reference to "type alias impl trait"**: This feature was stabilized in Rust 1.51, which was released in April 2021.
3. **Mention of "modules" in C++20**: Modules were a significant feature in C++20, and the author expresses anticipation for their implementation, which aligns with the post-C++20 release period.
4. **Reference to "Herb Sutter cppfront"**: Herb Sutter's cppfront project aims to modernize C++ syntax and was actively discussed around 2020-2021.
5. **Discussion on Hacker News and /r/rust**: These platforms are frequently used for discussing programming language news and developments.

### The Hint:
The distinctive writing style and the hint about a particular day and month of the year suggest a connection to April Fools' Day. The passage has a somewhat tongue-in-cheek tone, especially in the sections discussing the author's confidence in avoiding safety issues and the perceived friendliness of the C++ community. This playful and somewhat exaggerated tone is characteristic of April Fools' Day pranks.

### Conclusion:
Given the mention of features that were stabilized in Rust 1.51 (April 2021) and the playful, exaggerated tone that aligns with April Fools' Day, it is reasonable to guess that this passage was written on **April 1, 2021**. The author likely intended it as a humorous take on the ongoing debates between Rust and C++ communities, leveraging the April Fools' Day tradition of playful deception. [end of text]
