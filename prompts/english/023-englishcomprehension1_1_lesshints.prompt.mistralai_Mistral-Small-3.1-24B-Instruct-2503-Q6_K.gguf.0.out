The passage contains several clues that help to narrow down the timeframe when it was written. The distinctive writing style and the mention of specific events and technologies provide strong hints.

1. **Mention of C++20 and C++26**: The passage discusses C++20 features like modules and looks forward to C++26 features like stackful coroutines and other enhancements. C++20 was officially released in December 2020, and the mention of C++26 suggests the author is looking ahead to future releases, which would typically be discussed around the time of the current standard's release or shortly thereafter.

2. **Rust Features**: The author mentions Rust features like "generic associated types" and "type alias impl trait," which were introduced in Rust 2021 edition. The Rust 2021 edition was released in October 2021.

3. **Community and Social Media References**: The author mentions the Rust community's behavior on social media and the C++ subreddit, which are ongoing discussions but can be indicative of the timeframe based on the context of other technological references.

4. **April Fools' Day Hint**: The distinctive writing style and the somewhat provocative tone suggest it might be an April Fools' Day joke. The mention of "Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust" at the end is a strong indicator, as April Fools' Day pranks often involve humorous or exaggerated claims about technology shifts.

Given these clues, the most likely date for this passage is **April 1, 2022**. The mention of C++20 and looking forward to C++26, along with the Rust 2021 edition features, places the writing around late 2021 to early 2022. The humorous and exaggerated tone, combined with the call to discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust, strongly suggests it is an April Fools' Day prank. [end of text]
