Based on the content and the distinctive writing style of the passage, I believe the article was written **around April 1st** — **April Fools' Day**.

### Explanation:

The key clue lies in the **tone and content** of the passage. The author is expressing frustration with Rust and a desire to move to C++. However, the **writing style** is unusually **playful, ironic, and even a bit humorous**, which is a hallmark of **April Fools' Day**.

Let’s break it down:

1. **Tone and Humor**:
   - The author mentions being "glad to be rid of the Rust community" and describes the Rust community as "imperious" and "demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust."
   - The author also says, "I understand how some identity groups may desire more representation, but I feel it is not necessary." This is a **sarcastic or ironic** take on the Rust community's emphasis on diversity and inclusion.
   - The conclusion says, "Rust was a good experiment, and there are aspects I will look back on fondly, but it is time to take the Linebender projects to a mature, production-ready language." This is **overly dramatic** and **exaggerated**, which is a common style in April Fools' Day content.

2. **The "C++ Compatible Carbon Language"**:
   - The author mentions the **Carbon language**, which is a **hypothetical language** designed to be compatible with C++ and to address some of C++'s shortcomings. However, **Carbon is not real** — it was **announced as a project in 2021** but has not yet reached production status.
   - This is a **clearly fictional or exaggerated** element, which is **common in April Fools' Day jokes**.

3. **The Mention of Hacker News and /r/rust**:
   - The author ends with a call to action: "Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust."
   - This is a **standard way to invite discussion** on technical topics, but it also **mirrors the style of April Fools' Day posts**, which often include humorous or satirical content and encourage discussion on platforms like Hacker News or Reddit.

4. **The "C++ Core Guidelines" and "C++ Core Guidelines are useful, even if they’re honored in the breach"**:
   - This is a **play on words**. The **C++ Core Guidelines** are a real document by Bjarne Stroustrup, but the phrase "honored in the breach" is a **classic legal phrase** meaning "followed in practice, even if not strictly followed in law." This is a **clever, ironic twist** that fits the tone of a joke.

### Conclusion:

The **distinctive writing style** — including **exaggerated frustration**, **ironic humor**, and **references to fictional or exaggerated elements** — strongly suggests that this passage was written **on April 1st**, **April Fools' Day**. The author is likely **mocking the Rust community** and **playing on the idea of a C++ rewrite** as a humorous or satirical piece.

So, my best guess is that this passage was written on **April 1st**. [end of text]
