I love rainbows that appear after a storm. They are magical and full of colour. When the rain stops, the sky gets clear and bright. Then, if the sun comes out, a rainbow appears. It's like a big, beautiful arc in the sky.

The rainbow has seven colours: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Each colour is so pretty and different. Sometimes, the rainbow looks like it's touching the ground, and other times it seems to go all the way up to the sky.

I like to look for rainbows when it's raining. I wait for the rain to stop and then look up. If I'm lucky, I'll see a rainbow. It makes me feel happy and excited. Rainbows are a special gift from nature, and I always enjoy seeing them. [end of text]
