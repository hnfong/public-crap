Got it, let's tackle each sentence one by one. First, I need to remember the guidelines: simple, fluent, native-like, to the point. Let's start with 1.

1. Original English: "Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?" The first part is "Why are you hurry?" – native speakers say "Why are you in a hurry?" or more colloquially "Why are you hurrying?" But "Why are you in a hurry?" is more natural. The second part is okay, but maybe "Why are you worried they won't wait for you?" to make it smoother. So combined: "Why are you in a hurry? Are you worried they won't wait for you?" Wait, the original Cantonese is "你咁趕做咩啫，你慌人哋唔等你咩？" The first part is "Why are you rushing?" (更自然的是 "Why are you in a hurry?"), the second part "你慌人哋唔等你咩？" is "Are you worried they won't wait for you?" So maybe "Why are you in a hurry? Are you worried they won't wait for you?" That's more fluent.

2. Original: "He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids." "Haggle over trivial issues" – maybe "bother over small things" is more natural for a native speaker. "Magnanimous" is okay, but maybe "He's a big-hearted person" is more colloquial? Wait, the original says "夠大量" which is "very magnanimous" or "has a lot of度量 (forbearance)". "He's a big-hearted person, he doesn't bother with the kids over trivial stuff." Or "He's a magnanimous person, he doesn't argue with the kids over small things." "Haggle" might be too strong (haggle is like bargaining). So maybe "He's a big-hearted person—he doesn't get into trivial arguments with the kids." Or simpler: "He's a magnanimous person; he doesn't bother with the kids over small things." The original is okay, but "haggle over trivial issues" could be more natural as "bother over small things" or "argue about trivial stuff."

3. Original: "There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it." "To learn" should be "learning" – "There's no shortcut to learning a language; the key is massive exposure." More natural: "There's no shortcut to learning a language—you need lots of exposure." "Massive exposure to it" is a bit awkward; "lots of exposure" is better. So "There's no shortcut to learning a language; the key is lots of exposure." Or "There's no shortcut to learning a language—you need lots of exposure."

4. Original: "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender." "Tender" might not be the best word here—"gentle" is more common for describing someone's personality in this context ("温柔" is gentle). "Praises his girlfriend... for her being very gentle" – maybe "Siu-san tells his colleagues how gentle his girlfriend is." More natural: "Siu-san gushes to his colleagues about how gentle his girlfriend is." Or "Siu-san praises his girlfriend to his colleagues for being so gentle." The original is okay, but "tender" is a bit off; "gentle" is better. Also, "in front of his colleagues" vs "to his colleagues" – "praises... to his colleagues" is more natural when it's directed at them. So "Siu-san praises his girlfriend to his colleagues for being so gentle."

5. Original: "I take the metro to school every day." That's perfect—native-like, simple, to the point. No changes needed.

Let me check again:

1. Original: "Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?" → Suggested: "Why are you in a hurry? Are you worried they won't wait for you?" (More natural question structure, "in a hurry" is correct, "Are you worried" is smoother than "Why do you worry" since the first question already asks "why hurry," the second is confirming the worry.)

2. Original: "He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids." → "He's a big-hearted person—he doesn't bother with the kids over small things." ( "Big-hearted" is more colloquial than "magnanimous" for a native speaker, "bother over small things" is more natural than "haggle over trivial issues"; "haggle" implies bargaining, which isn't right here.)

3. Original: "There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it." → "There's no shortcut to learning a language—the key is lots of exposure." (Contraction "There's" is more natural, "learning" instead of "learn," "lots of exposure" is simpler than "massive exposure to it.")

4. Original: "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender." → "Siu-san praises his girlfriend to his colleagues for being so gentle." ("Gentle" is better than "tender" for "温柔," "to his colleagues" is more natural than "in front of" when praising to them, "so" instead of "very" is more colloquial.)

5. Original: "I take the metro to school every day." → No changes needed.</seed:think>1. Suggested sentence: Why are you in a hurry? Are you worried they won’t wait for you?
