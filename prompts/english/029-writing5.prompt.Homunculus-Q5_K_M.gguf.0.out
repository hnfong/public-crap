**Title: The Secret Life of a Wood Elf**

I am a high school student in Hong Kong, but I am not like other students. I am a wood elf, and I have been hiding my true identity for years. My name is Elara, and I live a double life.

Every morning, I wake up in my small apartment in Mong Kok. I brush my long, silver hair and put on my school uniform. I look like any other student, but inside, I am different. My ears are pointed, and my eyes are a deep green, like the forest. I try to hide these features with makeup and hairpins, but sometimes I forget, and my classmates stare at me.

At school, I try to be normal. I study hard, and I have many friends. But sometimes, I feel lonely. I miss the forest, the trees, and the animals. I miss my family. I was born in a hidden forest in the New Territories, where my parents still live. They are wood elves too, and they taught me to use magic. But when I was young, I was discovered by humans, and I had to leave my home. I was adopted by a kind human family, and they raised me as their own. They don’t know about my true identity, and I don’t want them to find out.

I have a secret place in the school garden where I practice my magic. I can talk to plants and animals, and I can make them grow. I use this power to help my friends. For example, when my friend Mei was sick, I made her a special tea from herbs I grew in the garden. She got better quickly, and she was very grateful. But I couldn’t tell her the truth.

One day, I was walking home from school when I saw a group of boys bullying a small girl. I couldn’t stand it, so I used my magic to make the boys stop. I made the ground shake, and they ran away. The girl looked at me with wide eyes, and I knew she had seen something strange. I was scared, but I smiled at her and said, “Don’t worry, I’m just a good friend.”

After that, the girl started following me. Her name was Lily, and she was very curious about me. She asked me many questions, and I tried to avoid them. But one day, she caught me talking to a squirrel in the garden. She was shocked, but she didn’t run away. Instead, she said, “You’re not like other people. You’re special.”

I was scared, but I also felt a little relieved. I told her my secret, and she promised to keep it. She said she wanted to help me, and she started learning about magic too. We became best friends, and she helped me practice my powers.

But one day, my secret was almost discovered. A teacher saw me talking to a bird in the garden, and she looked suspicious. I had to use my magic to make her forget what she saw. I felt bad about it, but I didn’t want to lose my friends or my school.

Now, I live a happy life. I have friends who accept me for who I am, and I can use my magic to help others. I still miss my family in the forest, but I know they are safe. I am a wood elf, but I am also a student, and I am proud of both parts of me.
