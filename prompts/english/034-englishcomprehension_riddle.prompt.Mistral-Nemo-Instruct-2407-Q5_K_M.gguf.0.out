Consider this scenario:

Alice: Are you eating healthy?
Bob: Yes! Today I ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato pur√©e spread on baked whole wheat.
Alice: Wow! Let me see.
Bob: (sends Alice a photo)
Alice: wtf

---
Question: what happened? What did Bob eat and was it healthy?

Bob ate a grilled cheese sandwich made with aged organic cheese, tomato soup, and whole wheat bread. While the ingredients are generally healthy, the cooking method (grilling) and the overall combination of ingredients might not be the healthiest option, especially if consumed regularly. Alice's reaction "wtf" suggests she was surprised or confused by Bob's response, possibly because she expected a more elaborate or healthier meal.
