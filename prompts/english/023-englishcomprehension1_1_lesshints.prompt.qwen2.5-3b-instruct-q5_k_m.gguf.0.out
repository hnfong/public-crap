Read the following passage, and make your best guess when (date) this was written.

```
I’ve been involved in Rust and the Rust community for many years now. Much of my work has been related to creating infrastructure for building GUI toolkits in Rust. However, I have found my frustrations with the language growing, and pine for the stable, mature foundation provided by C++.

Choice of build systems
One of the more limiting aspects of the Rust ecosystem is the near-monoculture of the Cargo build system and package manager. While other build systems are used to some extent (including Bazel when integrating into larger polyglot projects), they are not well supported by tools.

In C++, by contrast, there are many choices of build systems, allowing each developer to pick the one best suited for their needs. A very common choice is CMake, but there’s also Meson, Blaze and its variants as well, and of course it’s always possible to fall back on Autotools and make. The latter is especially useful if we want to compile Unix systems such as AIX and DEC OSF/1 AXP. If none of those suffice, there are plenty of other choices including SCons, and no doubt new ones will be created on a regular basis.

We haven’t firmly decided on a build system for the Linebender projects yet, but most likely it will be CMake with plans to evaluate other systems and migrate, perhaps Meson.

Safety
Probably the most controversial aspect of this change is giving up the safety guarantees of the Rust language. However, I do not think this will be a big problem in practice, for three reasons.

First, I consider myself a good enough programmer that I can avoid writing code with safety problems. Sure, I’ve been responsible for some CVEs (including font parsing code in Android), but I’ve learned from that experience, and am confident I can avoid such mistakes in the future.

Second, I think the dangers from memory safety problems are overblown. The Linebender projects are primarily focused on 2D graphics, partly games and partly components for creating GUI applications. If a GUI program crashes, it’s not that big a deal. In the case that the bug is due to a library we use as a dependency, our customers will understand that it’s not our fault. Memory safety bugs are not fundamentally different than logic errors and other bugs, and we’ll just fix those as they surface.

Third, the C++ language is evolving to become safer. We can use modern C++ techniques to avoid many of the dangers of raw pointers (though string views can outlive their backing strings, and closures as used in UI can have very interesting lifetime patterns). The C++ core guidelines are useful, even if they’re honored in the breach. And, as discussed in the next section, the language itself can be expected to improve.

Language evolution
One notable characteristic of C++ is the rapid adoption of new features, these days with a new version every 3 years. C++20 brings us modules, an innovative new feature, and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon. Looking forward, C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies.

By comparison, the pace of innovation in Rust has become more sedate. It used to be quite rapid, and async has been a major effort, but recently landed features such as generic associated types have more of the flavor of making combinations of existing features work as expected rather than bringing any fundamentally new capabilities; the forthcoming “type alias impl trait” is similar. Here, it is clear that Rust is held back by its commitment to not break existing code (enacted by the edition mechanism), while C++ is free to implement backwards compatibility breaking changes in each new version.

C++ has even more exciting changes to look forward to, including potentially a new syntax as proposed by Herb Sutter cppfront, and even the new C++ compatible Carbon language.

Fortunately, we have excellent leadership in the C++ community. Stroustrup’s paper on safety is a remarkably wise and perceptive document, showing a deep understanding of the problems C++ faces, and presenting a compelling roadmap into the future.

Community
I’ll close with some thoughts on community. I try not to spend a lot of time on social media, but I hear that the Rust community can be extremely imperious, constantly demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust, and denigrating all other programming languages. I will be glad to be rid of that, and am sure the C++ community will be much nicer and friendlier. In particular, the C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor.

The Rust community is also known for its code of conduct and other policies promoting diversity. I firmly believe that programming languages should be free of politics, focused strictly on the technology itself. In computer science, we have moved beyond prejudice and discrimination. I understand how some identity groups may desire more representation, but I feel it is not necessary.

Conclusion
Rust was a good experiment, and there are aspects I will look back on fondly, but it is time to take the Linebender projects to a mature, production-ready language. I look forward to productive collaboration with others in the C++ community.

We’re looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite. If you’re interested, please join our Zulip instance.

Read the passage above, and make your best guess when (date) this was written. The hint is the distinctive writing style of the article which is connected to one particular day and month of the year. Make sure to make use of the hint. Explain how your answer makes use of the hint. Be thoughtful and think outside the box.

assistant
To determine the date and month this passage was written, let's analyze the distinctive writing style and content that aligns with a particular day and month of the year. The passage discusses Rust and C++ in depth, mentioning specific versions and features of both languages. It also touches on community dynamics and the author's personal experiences with programming languages.

### Key Indicators:
1. **C++20 and C++26**: The author mentions C++20, which was released in 2020, and C++26, which is expected to be released in 2026. This timeline is significant.
2. **Rust's Evolution**: The passage notes that Rust's pace of innovation has slowed down, mentioning recent features like generic associated types and type alias impl trait. This suggests a period where Rust's development was more active.
3. **Community Dynamics**: The author mentions the Rust community's "imperious" nature and the C++ community's friendliness. This could be a reflection of a particular time when the C++ community was more welcoming.

### Specific Day and Month:
Given the timeline and the specific mention of C++20 and C++26, the most likely candidate for the date and month is **March 2020**. Here’s why:

1. **C++20 Release**: C++20 was released in March 2020. This is a significant milestone in the C++ language, and it aligns with the author's mention of C++20.
2. **Rust's Pace**: The author notes that Rust's pace of innovation has slowed down, which could be a reflection of the period when Rust was still actively developing new features but was also facing challenges in maintaining backward compatibility.
3. **Community Dynamics**: The author mentions the C++ community's friendliness, which could be a reflection of the welcoming nature of the C++ community during the early stages of C++20 adoption.

### Conclusion:
The distinctive writing style and the specific mention of C++20 and C++26, along with the community dynamics, strongly suggest that this passage was written in **March 2020**. This date aligns with the significant release of C++20 and the author's reflections on the state of Rust and C++ communities at that time. [end of text]
