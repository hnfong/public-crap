Consider this scenario:

Alice: Are you eating healthy?
Bob: Yes! Today I ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat.
Alice: Wow! Let me see.
Bob: (sends Alice a photo)
Alice: wtf

Question: what happened? What did Bob eat and was it healthy?

This scenario is playing on the ambiguity of language and our expectations. 

Here's what likely happened:

* **Bob's description is intentionally misleading.** He uses fancy words like "aged organic milk" and "seasoned tomato purée" to make his meal sound gourmet and healthy. 
* **The photo reveals the truth.**  The "wtf" reaction from Alice suggests the photo shows something unexpected and likely not appetizing or healthy.

**What did Bob eat?**

It's impossible to know for sure without seeing the photo, but it's probably something simple and potentially strange, like:

* **Tomato soup with milk poured on top.** The "aged organic milk" could be regular milk, and the "seasoned tomato purée" is just tomato soup.
* **A deconstructed pizza.** Maybe he had tomato sauce, cheese (implied by "seasoned"), and bread separately.

**Was it healthy?**

It depends on the specifics, but likely not exceptionally healthy. While tomatoes and whole wheat bread can be part of a healthy diet, the overall combination and preparation method might not be balanced or nutritious. 


The humor lies in the contrast between Bob's pretentious description and the likely reality of his meal.
