**The Pillow and the Cloud**

Lila had always been a worrier. She’d lie awake at night, her mind racing, twisting every small event into a disaster. One evening, after a minor disagreement with her best friend, Maya, she found herself tossing and turning, her pillow feeling like a rock beneath her head. “She probably hates me now,” Lila muttered, exaggerating the fallout until it felt like the end of their friendship. “She’ll never speak to me again. I’ve ruined everything.”

The next morning, Lila dragged herself to the park, her heart heavy. She sat on a bench, watching the clouds drift lazily across the sky. One cloud, in particular, caught her eye—it was shaped like a pillow, soft and fluffy, a perfect contrast to her own stormy thoughts. She remembered how Maya had once told her, “Love isn’t about never having problems; it’s about facing them together.”

Suddenly, Maya appeared, holding two ice cream cones. “I brought peace offerings,” she said with a smile. “And I wasn’t exaggerating when I said I missed you.”

Lila’s eyes welled up. “I’m sorry,” she said. “I was being silly, blowing things way out of proportion.”

Maya sat beside her, handing her a cone. “We all do that sometimes,” she said gently. “But love means we don’t have to carry the weight alone. It’s like a pillow—softening the blows, making the hard nights easier.”

As they sat together, sharing ice cream and watching the clouds, Lila understood. Love wasn’t about avoiding mistakes or exaggerating problems; it was about having someone to hold your hand through them, to remind you that even the darkest storms pass. And that, she realized, was the most important lesson of all.

Leo was a master of exaggeration. If he stubbed his toe, he’d limp around like he’d broken his leg. If he burned toast, he’d declare the kitchen a disaster zone. His friends rolled their eyes, but they loved him anyway—especially Clara, who saw past the drama to his kind heart.  

One rainy afternoon, Leo sat by the window, watching storm clouds gather. "This is it," he announced dramatically. "The sky is crying because I forgot to water my cactus!" Clara stifled a laugh and handed him a soft, fluffy pillow. "Here. Hug this instead of the cloud."  

Later, when Leo caught a cold, he moaned, "I’m dying! This is worse than the plague!" Clara tucked the pillow behind his back and sat beside him. "You’re not dying," she said gently. "You’re just sick. And I’m here."  

As Leo rested his head on the pillow, he noticed how the storm clouds outside had thinned, letting in a sliver of sunlight. "You know," he mumbled, "I’ve been exaggerating everything lately. Even the clouds aren’t as scary as I make them out to be."  

Clara smiled. "Love isn’t about ignoring the storms, Leo. It’s about having someone to share the pillow with when the clouds roll in."  

Leo hugged the pillow tighter, finally understanding. Love wasn’t about grand gestures—it was about softening the hard edges of life, one gentle moment at a time. And sometimes, that meant letting go of the exaggeration and just being there.
