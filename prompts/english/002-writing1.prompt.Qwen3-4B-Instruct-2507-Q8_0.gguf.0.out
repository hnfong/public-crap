In a quiet village nestled between rolling hills and a whispering forest, there lived a young girl named Lila. She had a habit of exaggerating—about the size of the moon, the speed of the wind, and especially the way her favorite pillow felt like a living cloud when she pressed her head into it.

Every night, Lila would lie on her soft, downy pillow and whisper to it, “You’re so big, you could float me to the sky!” She’d stretch her arms out, as if the pillow were a real cloud, and sometimes, when the wind blew just right, she’d believe it was lifting her gently upward.

Her neighbor, Mr. Finch, a kind old man with a garden full of lavender and a gentle laugh, would often smile and say, “Lila, your pillow is lovely, but clouds don’t carry people. They just drift.”

Lila would roll her eyes and say, “Oh, Mr. Finch, you don’t *feel* a cloud. You just see it. I feel it in my bones!”

One evening, a storm rolled in. Thunder cracked like a drum, and rain fell so hard it turned the village into a blur of gray. Lila, tucked under her quilt, clutched her pillow tightly, whispering, “The cloud is coming to save me!”

But the storm didn’t stop. The wind howled, and the trees bent like old men. Lila’s heart pounded. She began to exaggerate again—“The cloud is growing! It’s forming a bridge! It’s going to carry me to safety!”

Mr. Finch came to her window, holding a lantern. “Lila, the cloud isn’t coming to save you. But love is.”

She blinked. “Love? What does love have to do with clouds?”

He stepped closer. “When you lie in your bed, and your pillow feels warm, and you feel safe—when you say, ‘I love you’ to your pillow, or to your family, or to the sky—it’s not just a feeling. It’s real. It’s like a cloud. It doesn’t move fast or grow big. But it stays. It lifts you when you’re sad. It holds you when you’re afraid.”

Lila sat up slowly. “But I thought love was just… words.”

“No,” Mr. Finch said gently. “Love is the quiet moment when you don’t need to exaggerate. It’s when you know your pillow is soft because it’s been loved. It’s when you know the sky is kind because someone looked up and said, ‘I see you.’”

That night, Lila didn’t talk about clouds or floating. She simply lay in her bed, her pillow warm and familiar. She didn’t exaggerate. She just said, “I love you, pillow,” and smiled.

And in that moment, she felt something deeper than wind or weather—something soft, steady, and true.

From that day on, Lila stopped exaggerating about clouds. Instead, she learned that love doesn’t need to be loud or grand. It just needs to be real—like a quiet pillow, like a gentle breeze, like the quiet understanding that someone sees you, even when the world is stormy.

And sometimes, that’s enough. [end of text]
