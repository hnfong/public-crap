Sure! Here are the answers to your questions and the requested story:

### **1. How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?**

### **3. Write a short a story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.**

**Title: The Forest Encounter**

Once upon a time, deep in the heart of the Whispering Woods, the Three Little Pigs were on their way to visit their grandmother. They had built a sturdy brick house not far from the forest path and were enjoying a peaceful walk when they heard soft footsteps and the rustle of leaves.

Coming down the path was a girl wearing a bright red cloak — **Little Red Riding Hood**. She was carrying a basket of goodies for her grandmother, just like the pigs were.

"Good day!" said Peter, the eldest pig.  
"Hello!" replied Red. "Are you also going to visit your grandmother?"  
"Yes!" said Pam, the middle pig. "We heard she’s feeling under the weather."  
"So is mine," said Red. "Maybe we can walk together?"

They all agreed and continued down the path. As they walked, they shared stories — Red told them about her wolf encounter, and the pigs described how they had outsmarted the Big Bad Wolf years ago.

Suddenly, they heard a growl from behind a bush. Out stepped a **sly wolf**, eyeing the group hungrily.

"Well, well, what do we have here? A red snack and three porky treats!" he sneered.

But the pigs stood firm, shoulder to shoulder, and Red pulled out a can of pepper spray she had learned to carry after her last encounter.

"Try anything, and you’ll regret it!" warned Paul, the youngest pig.

The wolf, remembering past failures, decided not to mess with the group. He growled and slunk back into the woods.

"Thanks for helping us stay safe," said Red.  
"You're welcome," said Peter. "There’s strength in numbers — and cleverness too!"

Together, the Three Little Pigs and Little Red Riding Hood continued their journey, keeping a sharp eye out for trouble. They reached their grandmothers’ houses safely, and from that day on, they often met in the woods for walks, knowing that friendship and bravery could turn even strangers into allies.

**The End.**
