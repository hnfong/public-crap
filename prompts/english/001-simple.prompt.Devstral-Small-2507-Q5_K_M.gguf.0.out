1. You would have to count to 1000 before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number. The first number that contains the letter "A" is 1000.

2. "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." This sentence is famous for being a pangram, which means it contains every letter of the alphabet at least once.

3. Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived three little pigs named Peter, Paul, and Patrick. They were brothers and had just grown up enough to leave their mother's house and build their own homes. Peter, being the laziest, built his house out of straw. Paul, a bit more responsible, built his house out of sticks. Patrick, the most diligent, built his house out of bricks.

One day, while the three pigs were enjoying their new homes, they heard a knock at the door. Standing outside was a young girl in a red cloak, known as Little Red Riding Hood. She was on her way to visit her grandmother and had lost her way. The pigs, being kind-hearted, invited her in to rest and have something to eat.

As they were chatting, they heard a loud huffing and puffing sound outside. It was the Big Bad Wolf, who had heard about the three little pigs and wanted to eat them. The wolf blew down Peter's straw house easily, but Paul's stick house proved to be a bit more challenging. However, with a few more powerful puffs, the wolf managed to blow it down as well.

Patrick, who had built his house out of bricks, was not worried. He invited Little Red Riding Hood to stay with him until the wolf went away. The wolf, seeing that he couldn't blow down the brick house, tried to trick the pigs by disguising himself as their grandmother. But the pigs were too smart and didn't fall for his tricks.

In the end, the wolf gave up and left, and the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood lived happily ever after, learning the importance of hard work and being kind to others. [end of text]
