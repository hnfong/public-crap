## Answers to Questions:

**1. Explain the main thesis of the text in at most 3 sentences.**

The text argues that suffering exists because God created *everything*, including the potential for it, and we individually choose our subjective experiences, including those involving suffering.  We perceive evil and suffering not as an external force, but as a consequence of our own choices to experience or believe in it. Ultimately, the text suggests agency: we can change our experience, even if we currently feel trapped by it.

**2. Do you agree? Explain but be concise.**

Partially. The idea of subjective experience shaping reality resonates, but attributing all suffering to individual choice feels dismissive of systemic injustices and genuine hardship. While agency is important, ignoring external factors feels overly simplistic.

**3. Write a short poem (ideally that rhymes) based on the information above.**

The All-Creator made the whole,
Both joy and pain, to fill the soul.
You choose the lens through which you see,
Suffering's grip, or liberty.

A choice you made, though blind you roam,
To feel the dark, or find your home.
No final fate, no endless chain,
Change your mind, and rise again.
