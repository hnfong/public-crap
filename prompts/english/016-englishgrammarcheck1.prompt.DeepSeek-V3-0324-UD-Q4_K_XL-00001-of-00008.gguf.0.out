### **Grammar Mistakes (Tense & Agreement Issues)**  

1. **"seem to an unwarranted assault"** → Missing article ("a"). Should be: **"seem like an unwarranted assault"** or **"seem to be an unwarranted assault"**.  
2. **"it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down"** → Repetition of "monopolies" is awkward. Better: **"it seems their monopolies are still functional, allowing them to squeeze out profits before things break down."**  
3. **"I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs"** → Tense inconsistency. "Had" (past) clashes with "can" (present). Should be: **"I had no ounce of doubt that they could cut costs"**.  
4. **"Those who read history knows"** → Subject-verb disagreement. "Those" (plural) requires "know" (plural). Should be: **"Those who read history know"**.  
5. **"every industry goes through this phrase"** → Wrong word ("phrase" instead of "phase"). Should be: **"every industry goes through this phase"**.

### **Serious Stylistic Issues**  

1. **"McKinsey Pichai"** → Unclear reference. If sarcastic/jargon, it needs context. Otherwise, it reads as a mistake (Sundar Pichai ≠ McKinsey).  
2. **"In America We Trust they're capitalist enough"** → Awkward phrasing. Either capitalize properly (**"In America We Trust"**) or rephrase for clarity.  
3. **"it has been a fun ride"** → Abrupt tonal shift. The preceding text is analytical/critical, making this flippant remark jarring.  
4. **"People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years"** → Missing preposition. Should be: **"expectation of what their careers would look like"**.  
5. **"we're still sane though, just unique circumstances"** → Unclear antecedent. Who is "we"? If referring to the "funny stack," it needs clarification.

### **Other Problems (Logic/Clarity/Flow)**  

1. **"I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices"** → Ambiguous antecedent. "Some" could refer to "tech stocks" or "big tech companies." Clarify.  
2. **"the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial 'efficiency'"** → Vague metaphor. Define "ruthless capitalist engine" or specify mechanisms (e.g., cost-cutting, shareholder pressure).  
3. **"product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard"** → "Enshittification" is slang/jargon. If the audience isn't familiar, it needs explanation.  
4. **"Saving up for 'FI' isn't an aspiration"** → "FI" (Financial Independence) is undefined. Either spell out or assume reader knowledge.  
5. **"geographically misplaced"** → Unusual phrasing. "Geographically isolated" or "in a non-tech hub" would be clearer.

### **Additional Notes**  
- **Tone inconsistency**: The text shifts between analytical, sarcastic, and personal reflection without smooth transitions.  
- **Overuse of parentheses**: Some asides disrupt readability (e.g., "(GOOG mainly)"). Consider restructuring.  
- **Assumed knowledge**: Terms like "levels.fyi," "FI," and "enshittification" may confuse readers outside tech/finance circles.
