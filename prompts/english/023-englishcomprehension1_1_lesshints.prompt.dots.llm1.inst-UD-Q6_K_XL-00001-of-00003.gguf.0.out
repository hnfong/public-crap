The passage was likely written on **April 1st (April Fools' Day)**. Here's why the hint points to this date and how the distinctive writing style aligns with it:

1. **Satirical Tone and Controversial Claims**:  
   The article is highly critical of Rust and praises C++ in ways that seem exaggerated or ironic, especially given the context of Rust's safety guarantees and C++'s historical reputation for complexity. For example, the claim that "the C++ community will be much nicer and friendlier" is a humorous understatement, as C++ is not typically associated with being "friendly" or "humorous" (unlike, say, the Python community). Similarly, the dismissal of Rust's safety benefits and the praise for C++'s "rapid adoption of new features" (despite C++'s notorious complexity) reads like parody.

2. **Over-the-Top Praise for C++**:  
   The author lauds C++ as having "excellent leadership," "remarkably wise" roadmaps, and "rapid innovation," while dismissing Rust's slower pace of change as a flaw. This contrasts sharply with the broader developer sentiment in the 2020s, where Rust's safety and modern tooling are widely celebrated, while C++ is often seen as a legacy language in need of careful handling. The exaggerated praise feels like a joke.

3. **Dismissal of Rust Community and Politics**:  
   The comments about Rust's community being "imperious" and "denigrating all other programming languages," as well as the assertion that "programming languages should be free of politics," are provocative and oversimplified. These claims are at odds with the generally positive reputation of the Rust community for being welcoming and inclusive, making them sound like a satirical take.

4. **April Fools' Day Tradition**:  
   Tech communities often use April 1st to publish fake announcements or satirical critiques. The format of the article—a seemingly serious but hyperbolic critique of one technology in favor of another—fits this pattern. The closing line, "Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust," further suggests an invitation to engage in a lighthearted or ironic debate.

5. **Specific References to C++ Features**:  
   The mention of "C++20" (which was released in 2020) and speculation about "C++26" places the article's writing sometime after 2020. However, the exaggerated optimism about C++ and the harsh dismissal of Rust make more sense as a joke than as a genuine 2023/2024 perspective, especially given Rust's growing adoption in systems programming.

### Conclusion:  
The combination of hyperbolic praise for C++, dismissive humor about Rust, and the satirical tone strongly suggests this was written as an April Fools' joke. The hint about "distinctive writing style connected to one particular day and month" points directly to April 1st. Outside-the-box thinking is required because the article is structured like a serious critique, but the content reads like parody. 

**Final Answer:** April 1st. The article's satirical tone, exaggerated claims, and focus on C++ as a "better" alternative to Rust align with April Fools' Day traditions in tech communities. The hint about a "distinctive writing style" tied to a specific date points to this being a joke. [end of text]
