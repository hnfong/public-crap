I love rainbows, and the one I like the most is the big, bright one that appears after a summer shower. It's like a magical bridge in the sky, with all the pretty colours you can imagine.

One sunny day, I was playing in the garden when dark clouds rolled in. The rain started to fall, and I ran inside to get my wellies. When I came back out, the rain had stopped, and there it was – a beautiful rainbow!

The rainbow was so big, it seemed to stretch from one end of the garden to the other. The colours were so bright and clear: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Each colour was like a special friend, and together they made the most amazing sight.

I stood there, watching the rainbow, feeling happy and excited. It was like the sky was giving us a big, colourful hug. And that's why I love rainbows – they make me feel so joyful and full of wonder. [end of text]
