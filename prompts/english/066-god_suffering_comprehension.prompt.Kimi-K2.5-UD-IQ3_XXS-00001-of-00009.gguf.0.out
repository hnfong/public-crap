I'll work through each task based on the text provided.

**1. Main Thesis**

The text argues that God creates all possibilities and we, as conscious vessels with subjective experience (qualia), choose our own experiences—including suffering—through our beliefs and perspectives; what we perceive as evil or suffering is not objectively necessary but reflects our personal choices about what to experience and how to perceive reality.

**2. Agreement**

I partially disagree. While the phenomenological observation that perception shapes experience has merit, the claim that all suffering is chosen ignores: (a) developmental and environmental constraints on agency (children don't "choose" abuse), (b) the asymmetry between choosing to *believe* something and choosing to *experience* its absence (one cannot simply un-perceive torture while enduring it), and (c) the text's own contradiction—if God creates *everything*, then "choice" itself is God's creation, collapsing responsibility back into the divine nature the question originally challenged.

**3. Poem**

*The Vessel's Choice*

A mechanism vast, without face or name,
Spins infinite threads in its wordless game.
We ride in our vessels of subjective sight,
Choosing the darkness, choosing the light.

What horrors you suffer, what wounds you bear—
The text whispers softly: *You placed them there.*
Your qualia, private, your prison, your key,
The tiger you painted, then chose not to flee.

Yet somewhere a child in the cold and the waste
Did not ask for hunger, did not choose their place.
The law loves all equally—so the mystics profess—
But love without justice is a strange tenderness. [end of text]
