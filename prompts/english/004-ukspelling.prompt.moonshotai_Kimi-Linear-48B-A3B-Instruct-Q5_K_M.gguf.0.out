I like the rainbows that come after a big rain.  
They are not the thin kind that hide behind a cloud.  
They are the wide kind that jump across the sky like a giant’s ribbon.  

I stand in my garden and look up.  
The colours are bright: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple.  
They go from the ground to the clouds, like a path made of light.  

I smile and say, “Hello, rainbow!”  
It does not answer, but I know it is happy to see me too.  

Sometimes, I try to touch it, but my fingers go through the air.  
That is okay.  
It is still magic.  

When the sun comes out and the rainbow fades, I keep the picture in my mind.  
It helps me remember that even after the rain, something beautiful can appear. [end of text]
