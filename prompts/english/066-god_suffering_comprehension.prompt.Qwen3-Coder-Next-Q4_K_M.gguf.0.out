1. **Main thesis**: The text argues that God—understood not as a personal being but as the infinite, all-encompassing ground of all existence—creates *everything*, including all possible experiences; suffering and evil are not external impositions but subjective choices shaped by our perspective and beliefs, as we are conscious vessels who co-create our experience of reality through what we choose to perceive and believe.

2. **Agreement?** Partially. While the idea that *perception* shapes suffering is psychologically insightful (e.g., cognitive reframing), it risks minimizing real, structural harm (e.g., systemic violence, disease) that exists independently of individual belief. The claim that *all* suffering is a “choice” oversimplifies trauma, biology, and power imbalances.

3. **Poem**:

> I chose this view, this light, this shade—  
> Not fate, but gaze, not chain, but made  
> By thought I held, by trust I broke,  
> By what I *let* the world evoke.  
>  
> The tiger’s roar? A doll’s soft growl—  
> I named it real, and made it howl.  
> Yet hands still ache, and hearts still bleed:  
> Not all the world is in my head.  
>  
> So let me choose—not to deny  
> The pain that others feel nearby—  
> But see: the power to shift, to mend,  
> Begins where empathy begins. [end of text]
