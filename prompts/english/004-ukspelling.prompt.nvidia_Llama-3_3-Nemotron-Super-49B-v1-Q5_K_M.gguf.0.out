**Rainbow Delight in the British Skies**

I adore the rainbows that appear in our UK skies after a gentle spring shower. You know, the kind that comes after a drizzle on a cloudy day in April or May. The sun peeks through the gaps in the clouds, casting a magnificent arc of colour across the sky.

My favourite rainbows are those that stretch over the rolling hills of the Cotswolds or the lush green fields of Tuscany... wait, no! Of course, I mean the beautiful countryside of Yorkshire or Wales! The vibrant colours seem to dance above the patchwork fields, with the green hills as a perfect backdrop.

The colours are always so vivid: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Sometimes, if I'm lucky, I spot a double rainbow, with the second one faintly smiling behind the first. It's as if the sky is putting on a spectacular show, just for me! I feel happy and hopeful whenever I see one. [end of text]
