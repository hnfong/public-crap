Aspirin is a medication used to treat pain, fever, and inflammation. It is also used to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in people with certain conditions. Aspirin works by blocking the production of substances in the body that cause inflammation and pain. It is available in different forms, including tablets, capsules, and chewable tablets. It is important to take Aspirin as prescribed by a doctor and follow the directions carefully. If you have any questions or concerns about taking Aspirin, please consult with a healthcare professional.
