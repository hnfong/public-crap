3. Once upon a time, the three little pigs were on their way to visit their friend Little Red Riding Hood. They were excited to meet her and share stories of their adventures. As they walked through the forest, they encountered a big, bad wolf who tried to scare them away. But the three little pigs were brave and continued on their journey. When they finally reached Little Red Riding Hood's house, they were greeted with warm hugs and laughter. They spent the day playing games and sharing their favorite treats. As the sun began to set, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood said their goodbyes, promising to meet again soon. And as they walked back home, they felt grateful for their new friendship and the memories they had made. [end of text]
