My favourite rainbows come after a summer shower. The sky is still grey, but the sun peeks through, bright and warm. Then, like magic, a rainbow arches across the clouds.

I saw one just last week, stretching from our garden over the field behind the church. It had all seven colours: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. They shone so clear, like a painted bridge to another world.

Mum says rainbows happen when sunlight dances through raindrops. I like to think they’re nature’s way of smiling at us.

Once, I tried to find the end of a rainbow, hoping for a pot of gold. I ran through the park, past the swings and the duck pond. But the rainbow moved with me, always just out of reach. In the end, I sat on the grass, laughing. It didn’t matter. The joy was in the chase.

Now, whenever it rains and the sun returns, I look up. I smile, and the rainbow smiles back.

That’s why these rainbows are my favourite. They’re short, sweet, and full of hope. And they remind me that even after the wettest days, something beautiful can appear—just when you least expect it. [end of text]
