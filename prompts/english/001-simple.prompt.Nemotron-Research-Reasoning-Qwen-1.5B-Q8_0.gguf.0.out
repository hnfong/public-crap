Okay, I have three questions to answer. Let me take them one by one.

1. How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?

Hmm, so I need to figure out the smallest number where the English spelling of that number includes the letter 'A'. Let me think. The number 1 is "one", which has an 'A'. So maybe it's 1? But wait, let me check higher numbers.

Wait no, maybe I need to think about the number itself. The question is about counting up to when you first use 'A' in the spelling of a whole number. So perhaps the first number that includes 'A' in its spelling is 10? Because "ten" has an 'A'? Let me see: "ten" has 't', 'e', 'n'—no 'A'. So maybe 11? "Eleven" has 'e', 'l', 'v', 'e', 'n'—no 'A'. 12: "twelve" has 't', 'w', 'e', 'l', 'v', 'e'—no 'A'. 13: "thirteen" has 't', 'h', 'i', 'r', 'e', 'f', 't'—no 'A'. 14: "fourteen" has 'f', 'o', 'u', 'r', 't', 'e', 'e', 'n"—so 'o' and 'u' but no 'A'. So 'A' might first appear in "one" which is 1. So "one" has 'o', 'n', 'e'—no 'A'. So maybe "two" has 't', 'w', 'o'—so 'o' but no 'A'. "three": t, h, r, e, e—no 'A'. "four": f, o, u, r—has 'o' but no 'A'. "five": f, i, v, e—no 'A'. "six": s, i, x—no 'A'. "seven": s, e, v, e, n—no 'A'. "eight": e, i, g, h, t—no 'A'. "nine": n, i, n, e—no 'A'. So "ten": t, e, n—no 'A'. "eleven": e, l, e, v, e, n—no 'A'. "twelve": t, w, e, l, v, e—no 'A'. "thirteen": t, h, i, r, t, e, e, n—no 'A'. "fourteen": f, o, u, r, t, e, e, n—no 'A'. "fifteen": f, i, f, t, e, e, n—no 'A'. "sixteen": s, i, x, t, e, etc.—no 'A'. "seventeen": s, e, etc.—no 'A'. "eighteen": e, i, g, h, t, etc.—no 'A'. "nineteen": n, i, n, etc.—no 'A'. "twenty": t, w, e, n, t, y—no 'A'. "thirty": t, h, i, r, t, y—no 'A'. "forty": f, o, r, t, y—no 'A'. "fifty": f, i, f, t, y—no 'A'. "sixty": s, i, x, t, y—no 'A'. "seventy": s, e, etc.—no 'A'. "eighty": e, i, g, h, t, y—no 'A'. "ninety": n, i, n, etc.—no 'A'. "one hundred": o, n, etc.—no 'A'. "one hundred and one": same. So maybe "one" is 1, but does it have 'A'? "One" has 'O' and 'n', but no 'A'. So perhaps the first number where 'A' appears is 10? Let's see "ten": t, e, n—no 'A'. "eleven": same. "twelve": t, w, e, l, v, e—no 'A'. "thirteen": t, h, i, r, t, e, e, n—no 'A'. "fourteen": f, o, u, r, t, e, etc.—so 'o' but no 'A'. "fifteen": f, i, f, t, e, etc.—no 'A'. "sixteen": s, i, x, t, e, etc.—no 'A'. "seventeen": s, e, etc.—no 'A'. "eighteen": e, i, g, h, t, etc.—no 'A'. "nineteen": n, i, n, etc.—no 'A'. "twenty": t, w, e, n, t, y—no 'A'. "thirty": t, h, i, r, t, y—no 'A'. "forty": f, o, r, t, y—has 'o' but no 'A'. "fifty": f, i, f, t, y—no 'A'. "sixty": s, i, x, t, y—no 'A'. "seventy": s, e, etc.—no 'A'. "eighty": e, i, g, h, t, y—no 'A'. "ninety": n, i, n, etc.—no 'A'. "one hundred": same. So maybe "one" is 1, but it doesn't have 'A'. So perhaps the first number where 'A' appears is 100? Because "one hundred" has 'o', 'h', 'undred'—no 'A'. Or maybe "one thousand": 't', 'h', 'ousand'—no 'A'. So perhaps 'A' first appears in "two"? Wait no, "two" is t, w, o—no 'A'. "three": t, h, r, e—no 'A'. "four": f, o, u, r—has 'o', no 'A'. "five": f, i, v, e—no 'A'. "six": s, i, x—no 'A'. "seven": s, e, etc.—no 'A'. "eight": e, i, g, h, t—no 'A'. "nine": n, i, n, e—no 'A'. "ten": t, e, n—no 'A'. "eleven": same. "twelve": t, w, e, l, v, e—no 'A'. "thirteen": t, h, i, r, t, e, e, n—no 'A'. "fourteen": f, o, u, r, t, e, etc.—no 'A'. "fifteen": f, i, f, t, e, etc.—no 'A'. "sixteen": s, i, x, t, e, etc.—no 'A'. "seventeen": s, e, etc.—no 'A'. "eighteen": e, i, g, h, t, etc.—no 'A'. "nineteen": n, i, n, etc.—no 'A'. "twenty": t, w, e, n, t, y—no 'A'. "thirty": t, h, i, r, t, y—no 'A'. "forty": f, o, r, t, y—has 'o', no 'A'. "fifty": f, i, f, t, y—no 'A'. "sixty": s, i, x, t, y—no 'A'. "seventy": s, e, etc.—no 'A'. "eighty": e, i, g, h, t, y—no 'A'. "ninety": n, i, n, etc.—no 'A'. "one hundred": same. So maybe "one hundred and one" has 'A'? No, "and" has an 'A', but the question is about the letter 'A' in the spelling of the number itself. So perhaps the first number where the word includes 'A' is 100? Because "one hundred" has 'o', 'h', 'undred'—no 'A'. So maybe "two" is 2: "two" has 'w', 'o', 'o'? Wait no, "two" is t, w, o—so 'o' but no 'A'. So perhaps "three": t, h, r, e—no 'A'. "four": f, o, u, r—has 'o', no 'A'. "five": f, i, v, e—no 'A'. "six
