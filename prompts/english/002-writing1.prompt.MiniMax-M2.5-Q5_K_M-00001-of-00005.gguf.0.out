# The Boy Who Chased Clouds

Once upon a time, in a small village nestled between green hills, there lived a boy named Milo. Milo was curious about everything, but what he loved most was watching the clouds drift across the sky. He would lie on the soft grass for hours, his head resting on a fluffy pillow of dandelions, imagining the clouds were giant creatures sailing through the blue.

One day, Milo's grandmother became very ill. The doctors said she needed rest and peace to recover. Milo was worried and didn't know what to do. He thought that if he could bring her a piece of the sky, maybe it would help her feel better.

So Milo decided to climb the highest hill to catch a cloud. He climbed and climbed until his legs ached. When he finally reached the top, he stretched out his hand to grab a cloud, but it simply floated away. He tried again and again, but clouds are made of air and water—they cannot be held.

Feeling defeated, Milo sat down and began to cry. A wise old man who lived on the hill approached him. "Why are you crying, child?" he asked.

"I wanted to catch a cloud for my grandmother," Milo explained, "so she could be happy again."

The old man smiled warmly. "You don't need a cloud to bring love, my boy. Love is already all around you. It's in the warm soup you could bring her. It's in the stories you could read to her. It's in the time you spend by her side."

Milo realized he had been exaggerating the importance of grand gestures when simple ones mattered most. He ran back home and sat beside his grandmother's bed. He held her hand, told her stories about the clouds he had watched, and made her laugh.

As days passed, his grandmother grew stronger—not because of any cloud, but because of Milo's love and care.

**The Lesson:** Love is not found in grand, impossible gestures. It lives in the small, simple moments we share with others—kind words, gentle touches, and spending time with the people who matter most. [end of text]
