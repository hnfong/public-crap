Once upon a time, in a small village in the UK, there lived a child named Lily who loved the rainbows. Every time it rained, she would run outside and look up at the sky to see the beautiful colors. She loved the way the rainbows appeared after the rain, like a bridge of colors across the sky.

Lily's favorite rainbow was the one that appeared right after the rain had stopped. It was the biggest and brightest of all, and it seemed to stretch all the way from one end of the sky to the other. She would stand under it and close her eyes, feeling the warm raindrops on her face and imagining all the magical things that could happen under such a beautiful sky.

She would count the colors in the rainbow: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. She loved the way each color blended into the next, creating a beautiful tapestry in the sky.

Every day, Lily would look for the rainbow, and she always found it. She knew that the rainbow was there because of the rain, and she was grateful for the rain that brought her such joy. And every time she saw the rainbow, she would smile and feel happy. [end of text]
