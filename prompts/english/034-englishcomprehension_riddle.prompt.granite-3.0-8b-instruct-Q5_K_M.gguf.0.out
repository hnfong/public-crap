Consider this scenario:

Alice: Are you eating healthy?
Bob: Yes! Today I ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat.
Alice: Wow! Let me see.
Bob: (sends Alice a photo)
Alice: wtf

---
Question: what happened? What did Bob eat and was it healthy?

Bob ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat. This meal can be considered healthy as it includes whole wheat, which is a good source of fiber and nutrients, and organic milk, which is a good source of protein and calcium. However, the term "aged" for milk might not be common and could potentially refer to a specific type of cheese or a process that changes the nutritional content of the milk. Without more context, it's hard to determine if this specific meal is healthy or not.

Alice's reaction of "wtf" suggests that she might not have expected or understood what Bob ate, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the meal was unhealthy.
