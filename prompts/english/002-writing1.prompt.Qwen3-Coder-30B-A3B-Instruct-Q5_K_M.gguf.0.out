**The Weight of Love**

Sarah stared at the pillow beneath her head, its soft fabric now feeling heavy with unspoken words. Her husband Michael had been exaggerating again—telling her that their marriage was "the most perfect thing in the world" when she could see the cracks forming between them.

"Love isn't about grand gestures," she whispered to the cloud of dust motes dancing in the afternoon light streaming through their bedroom window. "It's about showing up, even when it's hard."

Michael had been gone for three days now, his words echoing in her mind. He'd said she was "too dramatic," that she was "exaggerating the problems" when all she'd wanted was for him to notice her, to see her, to love her.

But as she lay there, watching the cloud drift past the window, Sarah realized something profound. Love wasn't about perfection or grand declarations. It was about the quiet moments—the way Michael's eyes crinkled when he smiled at her, the way he'd always tucked her pillow behind her head when she was sick, the way he'd never really stopped loving her, even when he'd forgotten how to show it.

She picked up her phone and dialed his number, not to argue, but to apologize. Because love, she understood now, was about the willingness to forgive, to try again, to see past the cloud of misunderstandings to the person who truly mattered.

The pillow felt lighter now, filled with hope rather than hurt. [end of text]
