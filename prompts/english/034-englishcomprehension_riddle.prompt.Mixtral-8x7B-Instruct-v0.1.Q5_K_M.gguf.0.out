Consider this scenario:

Alice: Are you eating healthy?
Bob: Yes! Today I ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat.
Alice: Wow! Let me see.
Bob: (sends Alice a photo)
Alice: wtf

Question: what happened? What did Bob eat and was it healthy?

 [/INST] Based on the information provided, Bob claimed to have eaten aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat. However, this description is a bit unusual because milk is not typically tossed over other foods in this way. It is possible that there was a misunderstanding or miscommunication.

When Alice asked to see what Bob ate, he sent her a photo. Based on Alice's response ("wtf"), it is likely that the photo showed something that did not match Bob's description of his meal. Without seeing the photo, it is difficult to say for certain what Bob actually ate.

As for whether Bob's meal was healthy, it is difficult to make a definitive judgement based on the information provided. However, organic milk can be a good source of protein, calcium, and other nutrients, and whole wheat is a good source of fiber. Tomato purée can also be a healthy choice, as it is low in calories and high in vitamins and antioxidants. However, it is important to consider the overall balance and variety of the diet, as well as the specific preparation methods and ingredients used. [end of text]
