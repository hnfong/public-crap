 In the scenario, Bob described his meal as "aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat." However, when Alice asked to see a photo of the meal, her reaction ("wtf") suggests that the meal did not look as healthy or appetizing as Bob's description implied.

Without seeing the photo, it's difficult to determine exactly what Bob ate, but it's possible that the combination of ingredients did not result in a conventionally appealing or healthy-looking dish. The phrase "aged organic milk" is unusual and could refer to spoiled milk, which would not be healthy to consume. Additionally, the combination of these ingredients might not be typically considered a healthy meal, despite the individual components (organic milk, tomato purée, whole wheat) being generally healthy on their own.

In summary, Bob claimed to have eaten a healthy meal, but Alice's reaction to the photo casts doubt on whether the meal was actually healthy or visually appealing. [end of text]
