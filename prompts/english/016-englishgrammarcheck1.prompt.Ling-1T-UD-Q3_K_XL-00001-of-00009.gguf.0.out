### Grammar & Agreement Issues (Tense, Subject-Verb, Pronoun-Antecedent, etc.)

1. **"McKinsey Pichai"** – Incorrect noun phrase. "McKinsey" is a consulting firm; likely meant **"Sundar Pichai"** (CEO of Google). Using "McKinsey" here is a factual/grammatical error in noun usage.
2. **"Those who read history knows"** – Subject-verb disagreement. "Those" (plural) requires "know," not "knows."
3. **"GOOG mainly"** – Awkward adverb placement. Should be "mainly GOOG" or "GOOG, mainly," for standard adjectival use.
4. **"Andreessen Horowitz basically saying"** – Missing auxiliary verb. Should be "Andreessen Horowitz **is** basically saying" for grammatical completeness.
5. **"whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG"** – Pronoun reference ambiguity. "Some" (stocks) is clear, but the dash introduces specific tickers abruptly; better to use "namely" or rephrase for smoother logic flow (minor, but the construction risks misparsing).

### Serious Stylistic Issues (Tone, Clarity, Diction, Register)

1. **Overly casual/inconsistent register**: Mixing colloquialisms ("I mean," "shitty," "party’s gonna end") with formal analysis undermines credibility. "Shitty" and "enshittification" (though coined) are jarringly informal for the context.
2. **Unmarked parenthetical asides weaken logic**: "That said, it has been a fun ride." – This emotional aside interrupts the economic argument without transition, making the tone seem flippant.
3. **"In America We Trust"** – Capitalized phrase reads as sarcastic/jingoistic meme insertion, distracting from the serious point about regulatory capture. Undermines analytical tone.
4. **Vague or imprecise phrasing**: "revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech)" – "operationally much smaller" is unclear. Does it mean compute footprint, revenue, headcount? Ambiguity weakens the claim.
5. **"geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here)"** – "Misplaced" is an odd, almost euphemistic choice; "located in an area without tech jobs" or "based in a non-tech hub" is clearer and more professional.

### Other Problems (Logic, Consistency, Factual Ambiguity)

1. **Conflation of "McKinsey" and "Pichai"** – As noted, this implies Sundar Pichai is a McKinsey product or agent, which is misleading. It suggests a logic error in attributing corporate strategy.
2. **"I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half"** – Hyperbolic claim without evidence. "Almost half" is a specific, extreme assertion presented as self-evident, weakening credibility.
3. **"predatory capitalist attitude"** – Loaded term used without definition or nuance. While the author distances with "ideological concerns aside," the phrase frames the entire logic as morally suspect without engaging counterarguments.
4. **"tech companies can fail REALLY fast"** – ALL CAPS for emphasis is unprofessional in analytical writing. The point is valid but the delivery is emotionally charged.
5. **Ambiguous scope of "enshittification"** – The neologism is increasingly accepted, but here it’s used without clear scope: does it mean declining product quality, user exploitation, or innovation stagnation? The surrounding logic assumes reader familiarity, reducing clarity.
