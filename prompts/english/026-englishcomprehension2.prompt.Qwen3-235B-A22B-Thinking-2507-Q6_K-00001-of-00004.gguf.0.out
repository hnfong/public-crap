Okay, let's try to figure out this block problem. So, the question is about determining the color of a block whose color we initially don't know. Let me read through the problem again carefully.

First scenario: There are 3 black blocks on top of a block we don't know the color of (let's call this unknown color X), and beneath them (so below X) there's a blue block. So the stack from top to bottom would be: Black, Black, Black, X, Blue.

Then, we remove all blocks and shuffle them with one additional green block. So originally, how many blocks were there? Let's see: 3 black + X + blue = 5 blocks. Then we add one green, making it 6 blocks total. These 6 are shuffled and restacked.

After shuffling, the new stack has the yellow block on top of the blue block. Wait, but where did the yellow block come from? Wait, the original blocks were 3 black, X, blue. Then we added a green block. So the blocks we have after adding green are: 3 black, X, blue, green. But the problem mentions a yellow block in the new arrangement. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe I misread.

Wait, the problem says: "shuffle the blocks with one additional green block". So original blocks: 3 black, X, blue (total 5). Add one green, so now 6 blocks: 3B, X, Blue, Green. But then in the new arrangement, it says "the yellow block is on top of blue block". But yellow wasn't in the original set nor the added green. Wait, this must mean that X is yellow? Or maybe there's a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the problem has a typo, but more likely, I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again.

Original setup: 3 black blocks on top of X (unknown), beneath X is blue. So stack is [Black, Black, Black, X, Blue] from top to bottom.

Then, remove all blocks (so those 5), add one green block, making 6 blocks total. Then shuffle all 6 and stack them again. Now, in this new stack, the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

Wait, but where did yellow come from? The blocks we have after adding green are: 3 black, X, blue, green. So unless X is yellow, there is no yellow block. Because the problem states that after shuffling with the additional green, the yellow is on blue. Therefore, the only way there's a yellow block is if X was yellow. Because otherwise, the blocks are 3B, X, blue, green. So if X is yellow, then the blocks are 3B, Y, Blue, Green. Then when shuffled, yellow could be on blue.

Wait, but the problem says "the yellow block is on top of blue block" in the new arrangement. So yellow must exist in the shuffled blocks. Since the shuffled blocks consist of original blocks (3B, X, blue) plus green, the only way yellow is present is if X is yellow. Because otherwise, there's no yellow. So X must be yellow.

Wait, but let me confirm. Original blocks: 3 black, X, blue. Add green, so total blocks: 3B, X, blue, green. Then after shuffling, we have a stack where yellow is on blue. Therefore, yellow must be one of the blocks, so X must be yellow. Because the other blocks are black, blue, green. So X is yellow.

But wait, the problem says "the yellow block is on top of blue block" in the new stack. So in the new arrangement, somewhere in the stack, yellow is immediately above blue. Since blue is present (it was in the original), and yellow must be present, which can only come from X. Therefore, X is yellow.

But wait, the question is asking "What color is the block we don't know the color of?" which is X. So the answer should be yellow.

Wait, but let me check again. Let's list all blocks after adding green:

Original: 3 black, X, blue (5 blocks)

Add 1 green: total 6 blocks: B, B, B, X, Blue, Green.

After shuffling, the stack has yellow on blue. So yellow must be one of the blocks, which can only be X. Therefore, X is yellow.

Yes, that makes sense. So the unknown block X is yellow.
