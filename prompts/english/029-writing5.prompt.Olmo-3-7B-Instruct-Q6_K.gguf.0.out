**Whispers in the Wisteria Lane**

Most people at Ho Man Tin Secondary School called Mei Ling “Ming” for short. She was quiet in class, sat by the window in every possible seat, and always had a notebook hidden under her uniform blazer. But only a few knew the truth: that at dusk, when the city’s neon lights faded and the air grew cool, Mei Ling was not just a clever student. She was a wood elf.

Her real name was Maelis, and in the ancient forests of the eastern mountains, she had lived for centuries, moving silently among the trees and learning the secrets of the wood. But when her people’s village was threatened by a rising human warlord, the elders sent her to Hong Kong—a bustling, noisy city far from the old woods. There, she would blend in, keep her magic hidden, and watch over the city’s heart from the shadows.

At school, Ming was known for her sharp mind. She aced math and could recite classical poems by heart. But she never spoke of her home, or the way her fingers sometimes glowed faintly when she was lost in thought. She’d grown adept at hiding the shimmer of her pointed ears and the way her skin sometimes turned a pale, leafy green in moonlight.

One afternoon, during the annual school wisteria-planting ceremony, Ming found herself assigned to the main garden. The other students giggled as they planted tiny saplings, but Ming chose a lonely corner, where the wisteria vines hung heavy and thick. She closed her eyes and let the scent of blooming flowers wrap around her, feeling the gentle pulse of magic in the earth beneath her feet.

As the sun set, Ming felt the familiar call of the forest whispering through her mind. She pressed her palm to the bark, and for a moment, she could almost hear the trees sighing. She whispered a promise to her old home: she would protect the city, and one day, she would return.

That night, as the city lights twinkled on, Ming dreamed of ancient trees and the sound of running water in hidden streams. She woke with a smile, ready to face another day among the humans—her secret safe, her heart still rooted in the woods.

And in the quiet moments between classes, when no one was looking, Ming would sometimes dance barefoot in the dew, feeling the magic of two worlds flow through her.
