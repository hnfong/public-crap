## The Best Rainbows

I love rainbows. Not just *any* rainbows, though. My favourite ones aren’t the bright, bold ones you see after a big summer storm. They’re the shy ones.

You know the ones I mean? The ones that appear when it’s still drizzling, and the sun peeks through the clouds for just a moment. They’re pale and watery, like someone’s painted them with watercolour. 

They don’t shout “LOOK AT ME!” They whisper, “Hello.”

Sometimes, you only see a little bit of one – just a curve of green over Farmer Giles’ field, or a smudge of violet above Mrs. Higgins’ garden. 

My Nan says those are the lucky rainbows. She says they’re made of wishes and raindrops, and if you blink, you might miss them. 

I always try to be very still when I see a shy rainbow. I close my eyes and make a wish, hoping it floats all the way up to where the colours end. They’re the best rainbows, definitely.
