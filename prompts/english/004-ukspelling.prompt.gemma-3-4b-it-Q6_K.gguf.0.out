Okay, here’s a short story for UK children about rainbows, aiming for simple language and a British feel:

My favourite rainbows aren’t the big, flashy ones you see after a proper downpour. I love the little, sneaky rainbows you get in a garden. 

They’re usually just a bit of colour hanging in the mist from the watering can.  A tiny, perfect arc of red, like a strawberry, next to a stripe of sunshine yellow. Sometimes there’s a bit of leafy green and a patch of blue, like a robin’s egg. 

They don’t last long, do they? Just a few minutes, shimmering and bright.  You have to look *just* right, with the sun behind you and the rain in front. 

My Nan always says they’re like tiny promises. Little bits of magic, reminding us that even after a grey day, there’s always a bit of colour waiting.  And that’s a rainbow I really, really love.

Would you like me to tweak this, or perhaps write a story with a different theme? [end of text]
