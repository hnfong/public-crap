1. The main thesis of the text is that suffering and evil in the world are subjective experiences chosen by individuals, and that everything, including our experiences, is a creation of God. The text argues that our perception of suffering and evil is a personal choice, and that we can change our experiences by changing our perspective.

2. I agree with the text's perspective that our experiences are subjective and shaped by our choices. However, I believe that the existence of suffering and evil in the world is not solely a matter of personal choice, but also influenced by external factors such as social structures, economic systems, and natural disasters. While we can choose how we perceive and respond to these experiences, we cannot always control their occurrence.

3. Here's a short poem based on the information above:

In the realm of God's creation,
We choose our experiences, our fate,
Suffering and joy, a personal choice,
Our subjective worlds, we create.

Perspective shifts, reality bends,
We can change, if we intend,
From innocence to knowledge gained,
Our choices shape the world we've framed.

So let us choose with care and grace,
To see the beauty in every face,
For in our choices, we find the key,
To a world where suffering is free. [end of text]
