So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

Please review this text and point out any grammar mistakes (especially tense and "agreement" issues), serious stylistic issues, or other problems. Do not report minor stylistic/sentence structure issues. Output in list/point form. Identify at least 5 issues in each category.
[/INST] 1. **Grammar Mistakes (Tense and Agreement Issues):**
   - "So there's a running story" should be "So there is a running story" for proper agreement.
   - "he's probably onto something" should be "he is probably onto something" for proper agreement.
   - "when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people" should be "when shareholders are unhappy, they can always lay off more people" (correct phrasal verb usage).
   - "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough" should be "In America we trust they are capitalist enough" for proper capitalization and agreement.
   - "With interest rates still held 'high', the free money is draining away" should be "With interest rates still being held high, the free money is draining away" for proper tense usage.
   - "Those who read history knows" should be "Those who read history know" for proper subject-verb agreement.
   - "it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later" should be "it is obvious by now, the party is going to end sooner or later" for proper tense and agreement.
   - "Saving up for 'FI' isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity" should be "Saving up for 'FI' is not an aspiration -- it is a survival necessity" for proper agreement.

2. **Serious Stylistic Issues:**
   - The use of ellipses (...) is excessive and should be reduced for better flow.
   - The text switches between formal and informal language (e.g., "he's" vs. "he is", "gonna" vs. "going to"). Consistency should be maintained.
   - The text uses colloquial language and slang (e.g., "gonna", "shit", "dude"), which may not be appropriate for all audiences.
   - The text contains many parenthetical remarks, which can disrupt the flow and make the text harder to read.
   - The text uses first-person perspective ("I", "my") excessively, which can make it seem more like a personal rant than an objective analysis.

3. **Other Problems:**
   - The text makes many assumptions and generalizations without providing evidence or sources (e.g., "tech workers are not doing enough real work", "tech companies can fail REALLY fast").
   - The text contains acronyms and jargon (e.g., "FI", " levels.fyi") that may not be familiar to all readers.
   - The text contains run-on sentences and sentence fragments, which can make it harder to read and understand.
   - The text lacks a clear structure or argument, making it difficult to follow the author's train of thought.
   - The text contains personal anecdotes and opinions that may not be relevant or interesting to all readers.
