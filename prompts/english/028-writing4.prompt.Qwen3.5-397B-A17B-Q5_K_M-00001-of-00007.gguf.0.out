Everybody called her Aspirin -- she always looked like she was aspiring to become a special state of being, and just looking at her made your headache go away.

It wasn't that she was conventionally beautiful, though she had a certain symmetry to her features that was pleasing enough. It was the way she moved through the world, as if gravity held less sway over her than it did over the rest of us. While the rest of the office at Sterling & Hallow trudged through the fluorescent-lit corridors with shoulders hunched against the weight of spreadsheets and looming deadlines, Aspirin seemed to float. Her step was light, her posture impossibly straight, and her eyes held a perpetual, unnerving clarity, as if she were viewing reality through a lens that had been meticulously cleaned of all smudges and distortions.

Her real name was Elara Vance, but nobody had used it in years. The nickname had started as a joke during the Great Q3 Crunch of 2019, when the entire marketing department was running on caffeine and panic. Someone had muttered that looking at Elara's calm demeanor felt like swallowing two extra-strength tablets. The name stuck, first as a whisper, then as a greeting, and finally as her sole identifier. Even her boss, a man prone to migraines and shouting, would buzz her intercom and say, "Aspirin, I need you in here. My head is splitting."

And she would arrive. She wouldn't bring coffee or solutions immediately; she would just stand there, radiating a quietude so profound it felt physical. She would tilt her head slightly, listen to his rant about quarterly projections or vendor failures, and somehow, by the time she spoke, the tension in the room would have evaporated. Her voice was low and rhythmic, not hypnotic, but grounding. She didn't offer platitudes. She offered perspective. She had an uncanny ability to distill chaotic problems into their simplest forms, stripping away the emotional noise until only the core issue remained, solvable and small.

But there was a cost to being Aspirin, a side effect no one talked about.

I noticed it first during the winter holidays. The office was empty, save for the two of us finishing up the year-end reports. The silence was heavy, the kind that usually makes introverts comfortable, but Elara looked uneasy. She was staring out the window at the gray snow falling on the parking lot, her usual glow dimmed.

"Do you ever get tired?" I asked, breaking the silence. "Of being the cure?"

She turned to me, and for the first time, I saw a crack in the facade. Her eyes, usually so clear, looked weary. "People think I'm aspiring to something higher," she said softly, echoing the origin of her nickname. "They think I'm trying to be saintly or enlightened. But I'm not aspiring to be anything, really. I'm just trying to stay intact."

She walked over to my desk and leaned against it. "When everyone around you is in pain, you learn to become the opposite. You suppress your own noise so you don't add to the cacophony. Eventually, you forget how to make noise at all. You become static. You become... medicine."

It was a chilling confession. We treated her like a resource, a tool to be pulled from the shelf when our heads pounded. We never asked if *she* had a headache. We never wondered if her own life was a mess of tangled wires and screaming thoughts that she had to constantly mute to maintain her equilibrium.

"That sounds lonely," I said.

"It is," she admitted, a small, sad smile touching her lips. "But then someone walks in with a furrowed brow, and the instinct takes over. You see the pain, and you automatically shift into relief mode. It's a reflex now. I don't know how to just *be* with someone in their mess without trying to fix it. I've aspired so hard to be the solution that I've forgotten how to be the problem, or even just a person."

We finished the reports in silence after that, but the dynamic had shifted. I stopped seeing her as a magical entity and started seeing her as a woman carrying a heavy, invisible load.

The next day, when the office chaos resumed and the phones began to ring off the hook, I saw Mr. Henderson storm out of his office, red-faced and clutching his temple. "Aspirin!" he bellowed. "I need you!"

Elara stood up, her mask sliding back into place with practiced ease. The float returned to her step; the clarity returned to her eyes. She was ready to dissolve the tension, to absorb the stress, to be the remedy.

But as she passed my desk, I did something I'd never done before. I reached out and gently touched her sleeve. She paused, looking down at me, surprised.

"Take five minutes first," I whispered. "Just for you. Before you fix everyone else."

She blinked, the automatic response halting for a fraction of a second. In that pause, I saw the real Elara, fragile and human. She nodded, a genuine, unpolished nod, and took a deep breath that seemed to rattle in her chest.

"Okay," she said, her voice lacking its usual melodic perfection, sounding instead rough and real. "Five minutes."

She didn't go to Henderson immediately. She walked to the breakroom, poured a cup of water, and stared out the window at the gray snow. She wasn't aspiring to be a special state of being in that moment. She was just standing there, existing, allowing herself to be ordinary. And strangely, watching her do nothing made my own chest feel a little lighter, proving that perhaps the real cure wasn't in her perfection, but in her humanity.

We still call her Aspirin. We probably always will. But now, when we ask for her help, we also ask how she's doing. And sometimes, just sometimes, she tells us the truth: that her head hurts too, and that's okay. Because even aspirin needs to be taken with care, and even the cure deserves to be healed.
