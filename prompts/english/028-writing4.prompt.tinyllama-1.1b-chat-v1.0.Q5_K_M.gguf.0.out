I'm Aspirin. I aspire to be something special.

Everybody called me Aspirin, and it made my headache go away. I always looked like I was aspiring to be something special, and my friends called me by that name too. Aspirin was a word that they used to describe someone who aspired to become a special state of being, and just looking at me made your headache go away. My friends used that word to describe me, and it made them happy. They were happy because they could look at me and not worry that I was going to make them feel bad about themselves. I always looked like I was going to be something special, but nobody could tell that from my appearance. I'm Aspirin, and I aspire to be something special.</s>
