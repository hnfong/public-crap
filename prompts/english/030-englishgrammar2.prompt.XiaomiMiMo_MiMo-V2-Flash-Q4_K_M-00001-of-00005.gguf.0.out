<think>First, the user wants me to review the English translations and suggest modifications if needed. The sentences are written by a native Cantonese speaker who might not be good at English. I need to make the English simple, fluent, native-like, and to the point. If no changes are needed, just output the original sentence.

I'll go through each sentence one by one.

1. Original Cantonese: 你咁趕做咩啫，你慌人哋唔等你咩？  
   Original English: Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?

   - "Why are you hurry?" is incorrect. It should be "Why are you in a hurry?" or "Why are you hurrying?"  
   - The second part is okay, but it could be more fluent.  
   - Suggested sentence: "Why are you in such a hurry? Do you worry that they won't wait for you?"  
   - But to keep it simple and native-like: "Why are you hurrying? Are you worried they won't wait for you?"  
   - I think "Why are you in a hurry?" is better.  
   - Also, the original has two questions, so I should keep that structure.

2. Original Cantonese: 佢份人够大量，唔同班𡃁仔計較。  
   Original English: He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids.

   - "Magnanimous" is a bit formal. Native speakers might use "generous" or "easygoing" in this context.  
   - "Haggle over trivial issues" is okay, but "计较" means "to计较" or "to fuss over", so "doesn't fuss over small things" might be better.  
   - "班𡃁仔" is "the kids" or "the young ones".  
   - Suggested sentence: "He is generous and doesn't fuss over small things with the kids."  
   - Or to make it more fluent: "He's easygoing and doesn't计较 with the young ones." But I need to use English.  
   - "He doesn't haggle with the kids over trivial matters." But "haggle" is for bargaining, so "fuss" might be better.  
   - Original: "He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids."  
   - Suggested: "He is a generous person and doesn't fuss over small things with the kids."

3. Original Cantonese: 學語文冇捷徑，要靠大量浸淫。  
   Original English: There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it.

   - "Learn a language" should be "learning a language" for grammar.  
   - "Massive exposure" is okay, but "浸淫" means "immersion" or "extensive exposure".  
   - Suggested sentence: "There is no shortcut to learning a language; it requires extensive immersion."  
   - Or: "Learning a language has no shortcuts; you need to immerse yourself in it."  
   - To keep it simple: "There's no shortcut to learning a language; you need to be immersed in it."  
   - The original is close, but "the key is massive exposure" could be "the key is extensive exposure" or "immersion".

4. Original Cantonese: 小新喺同事面前讚美女朋友有几温柔。  
   Original English: Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender.

   - "For her being very tender" is awkward. It should be "for being very tender" or "for her tenderness".  
   - "Praises his girlfriend" is fine, but the structure could be better.  
   - Suggested sentence: "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her tenderness."  
   - Or: "Siu-san praises how tender his girlfriend is in front of his colleagues."  
   - To make it native-like: "Siu-san compliments his girlfriend on her tenderness in front of his colleagues."  
   - But "praises" is okay.  
   - Original: "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender."  
   - Suggested: "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for being very tender."

5. Original Cantonese: 我日日都搭地鐵返學。  
   Original English: I take the metro to school every day.

   - This seems fine. "Metro" is commonly used for subway in some regions, but in English, "subway" or "地铁" is often "subway" in American English, or "metro" in British English.  
   - Since the user is Cantonese, "地鐵" is "subway" or "metro".  
   - The sentence is simple and fluent. No changes needed.  
   - But to confirm: "I take the subway to school every day." or "I take the metro to school every day."  
   - The original is "I take the metro to school every day." which is acceptable.

Now, for the output, I need to give one suggested English translation per sentence, or just output the original if no changes are needed.

Let me list them:

1. Suggested: "Why are you in a hurry? Are you worried they won't wait for you?"  
   - But the original has two questions, so I should keep that.  
   - Alternatively: "Why are you hurrying? Do you worry that they won't wait for you?"  
   - I think "Why are you in a hurry?" is better than "Why are you hurry?"  
   - So, Suggested: "Why are you in a hurry? Do you worry that they won't wait for you?"

2. Suggested: "He is generous and doesn't fuss over small things with the kids."  
   - Or: "He is easygoing and doesn't计较 with the young ones." but I need English.  
   - "He doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids" is okay, but "haggle" might not be perfect.  
   - "He is magnanimous" is formal, so "generous" is simpler.  
   - Suggested: "He is a generous person and doesn't fuss over small things with the kids."

3. Suggested: "There is no shortcut to learning a language; it requires extensive immersion."  
   - Or: "Learning a language has no shortcuts; you need to immerse yourself in it."  
   - To match the original structure: "There is no shortcut to learning a language; the key is extensive exposure."  
   - But "massive exposure" is fine, but "extensive" might be more native.  
   - Suggested: "There is no shortcut to learning a language; you need to be immersed in it."

4. Suggested: "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for being very tender."  
   - Or: "Siu-san praises his girlfriend's tenderness in front of his colleagues."  
   - I think "for being very tender" is acceptable, but it could be smoother.  
   - Suggested: "Siu-san compliments his girlfriend on her tenderness in front of his colleagues."  
   - But "praises" is fine.  
   - Original: "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender."  
   - Suggested: "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her tenderness."

5. No changes needed: "I take the metro to school every day."
