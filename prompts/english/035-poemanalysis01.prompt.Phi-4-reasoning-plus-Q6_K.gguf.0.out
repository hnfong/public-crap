We need to comment on this text. The text is a short poem or commentary on Mario's inertia of running making him slip into the abyss, and then "skill issue". It might be a commentary on the physics of Mario's running in the game, or a commentary on the game mechanics. It might be a humorous commentary on the game's physics. It might be a commentary on the fact that Mario's inertia of running causes him to slip into the abyss, and that is a "skill issue" (i.e. a problem with the player's skill, not the game's physics). Alternatively, it might be a commentary on the game's physics engine. It might be a commentary on the fact that Mario's inertia of running is a problem in the game, causing him to slip into the abyss, and that is a "skill issue" (i.e. a problem with the player's skill, not the game's physics). Alternatively, it might be a commentary on the fact that the game's physics engine is flawed, causing Mario to slip into the abyss. Alternatively, it might be a commentary on the fact that the game's physics engine is flawed, causing Mario to slip into the abyss, and that is a "skill issue" (i.g. a problem with the player's skill, not the game's physics). Alternatively, it might be a commentary on the fact that the game's physics engine is flawed, causing Mario to slip into the abyss, and that is a "skill issue" (i.e. a problem with the player's skill, not the game's physics).
