The given text appears to be a short poem or a metaphorical statement about the challenges of running and the consequences of not having enough skill or control.

The first line, "inertia of running," refers to the resistance or force that opposes the motion of an object when it is in motion. In the context of running, this could be interpreted as the difficulty of maintaining a consistent pace or the effort required to keep moving forward.

The second line, "makes Mario slip," seems to be a reference to the popular video game character, Mario. This line suggests that the inertia of running can cause Mario to lose control and slip, which could be a metaphor for losing balance or control in real life.

The third line, "into the abyss," implies that the consequences of losing control while running can be severe, as it could lead to a fall or a dangerous situation. The use of the word "abyss" adds a sense of depth and danger to the situation.

The final line, "skill issue," suggests that the problem lies in the individual's lack of skill or ability to control their movements while running. This could be interpreted as a reminder to practice and improve one's skills in order to avoid such consequences.

Overall, the text seems to be a metaphorical statement about the challenges of running and the importance of skill and control in order to avoid dangerous situations. [end of text]
