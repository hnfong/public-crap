# The Girl Who Was Aspirin

Everybody called her Aspirin — she always looked like she was aspiring to become a special state of being, and just looking at her made your headache go away.

She had a way of moving that made the air feel lighter, like someone had opened a window in a stuffy room. When she walked into the office, the fluorescent lights seemed to hum a little less aggressively. When she sat down at the conference table, the coffee-stained napkins and the lingering smell of burnt popcorn from the break room seemed to fade into the background. It wasn't magic, exactly. It was more like a very specific kind of presence. She was the kind of person who could make a room exhale.

Her name was Mara, but nobody used it. Aspirin was easier. It was a nickname that stuck because it was true. She didn't mind. She had a soft smile that never quite reached her eyes, and she listened with the kind of attention that made you feel like you were the only person in the room. She was good at her job, which was to make things easier. She was a fixer, a problem solver, a person who could untangle the knots in other people's days.

She had a system. She kept a small notebook, the kind with a worn leather cover, filled with neat handwriting. She wrote down the things that hurt. Not just the obvious things — the deadlines, the broken printers, the client who never returned calls. She wrote down the quiet things. The way the air conditioning unit in the office always seemed to be fighting a losing battle against the heat. The way the coffee machine gurgled and sputtered, making everyone’s morning a little more fragile. The way the fluorescent lights flickered just enough to make you feel like you were living inside a slightly broken television.

She wrote down the things that made people tired. The way the boss always started meetings five minutes late, making everyone sit in uncomfortable silence, checking their phones. The way the intern always seemed to be in the way, not because he was clumsy, but because he was new and trying too hard. The way the woman in accounting always wore perfume that was too strong, making the air feel thick and cloying.

She wrote down the things that made people angry. The way the client always changed their mind at the last minute, sending everyone into a scramble. The way the software always seemed to crash right before a big presentation. The way the parking lot always seemed to be full, forcing everyone to park three blocks away and walk in the heat.

She wrote down the things that made people sad. The way the office plant in the corner always seemed to be dying, no matter how much water it got. The way the woman in the next cubicle always seemed to be on the verge of tears, her eyes red-rimmed and her voice a little too quiet. The way the man who used to sit by the window, who always brought in homemade cookies, was gone now, and the space he left felt like a hole in the world.

She wrote down the things that made people feel small. The way the boss always seemed to have a better idea, a smarter solution, a more efficient way of doing things. The way the client always seemed to know more about the project than the people who were actually working on it. The way the intern always seemed to be learning faster than anyone else, making everyone else feel like they were falling behind.

She wrote down the things that made people feel lost. The way the office layout was a maze, with hallways that led nowhere and doors that opened onto other hallways. The way the company’s mission statement was a long, convoluted sentence that nobody could remember. The way the future always seemed to be a question mark, a vague, unsettling feeling that something was always about to change.

She wrote down the things that made people feel like they were drowning. The way the workload always seemed to be too much, a tide that never receded. The way the deadlines always seemed to be too tight, a pressure that squeezed the life out of everything. The way the expectations always seemed to be too high, a mountain that everyone was expected to climb, but nobody had the right shoes for.

She wrote down the things that made people feel like they were invisible. The way the boss always seemed to forget her name, calling her "hey, you" or "the one with the notebook." The way the client always seemed to be talking to someone else, even when she was the one answering their questions. The way the intern always seemed to be looking past her, as if she was just another piece of furniture in the room.

She wrote down the things that made people feel like they were screaming into a void. The way the emails always seemed to be unanswered, a digital silence that echoed in the mind. The way the phone calls always seemed to go to voicemail, a recorded message that felt like a wall. The way the meetings always seemed to be about everything and nothing, a swirling vortex of words that never seemed to lead anywhere.

She wrote down the things that made people feel like they were drowning in a sea of noise. The way the office was always loud, a constant hum of voices, keyboards, and printers. The way the city outside was always loud, a constant roar of traffic and construction. The way the world itself seemed to be loud, a constant, overwhelming symphony of sound that made it hard to think.

She wrote down the things that made people feel like they were lost in a fog. The way the instructions were always unclear, a maze of jargon and assumptions. The way the goals were always shifting, a moving target that nobody could hit. The way the future was always uncertain, a question mark that hung over everything like a storm cloud.

She wrote down the things that made people feel like they were carrying a weight. The way the responsibilities always seemed to be too much, a burden that pressed down on the shoulders. The way the expectations always seemed to be too high, a pressure that squeezed the life out of everything. The way the past always seemed to be a chain, a weight that dragged people down into the past.

She wrote down the things that made people feel like they were alone. The way the office was always full of people, but it always felt empty. The way the city was always full of people, but it always felt like a desert. The way the world was always full of people, but it always felt like a vast, empty space.

She wrote down the things that made people feel like they were broken. The way the mistakes always seemed to be too big, a crack that ran through everything. The way the failures always seemed to be too much, a weight that pulled people down. The way the pain always seemed to be too deep, a wound that never seemed to heal.

She wrote down the things that made people feel like they were dying. The way the days always seemed to be too long, a slow, grinding march towards the end. The way the nights always seemed to be too short, a brief, restless respite that never felt like enough. The way the future always seemed to be a question mark, a vague, unsettling feeling that something was always about to end.

She wrote down the things that made people feel like they were nothing. The way the world always seemed to be too big, a vast, overwhelming space that made people feel insignificant. The way the problems always seemed to be too big, a mountain that nobody could climb. The way the pain always seemed to be too much, a weight that crushed everything.

She wrote down the things that made people feel like they were everything. The way the small acts of kindness always seemed to matter, a spark of light in the darkness. The way the moments of connection always seemed to matter, a bridge between souls. The way the acts of love always seemed to matter, a force that could move mountains.

She wrote down the things that made people feel like they were alive. The way the sun always seemed to rise, a promise of a new day. The way the seasons always seemed to change, a rhythm that reminded people of the passage of time. The way the stars always seemed to shine, a reminder that there was something bigger than the everyday grind.

She wrote down the things that made people feel like they were human. The way the laughter always seemed to bubble up, a sound that cut through the noise. The way the tears always seemed to fall, a release that cleansed the soul. The way the silence always seemed to settle, a moment of peace that allowed people to breathe.

She wrote down the things that made people feel like they were whole. The way the pieces always seemed to fit together, a puzzle that finally made sense. The way the cracks always seemed to heal, a scar that told a story. The way the broken things always seemed to be mended, a restoration that brought new life.

She wrote down the things that made people feel like they were free. The way the chains always seemed to break, a liberation that set people loose. The way the walls always seemed to crumble, a collapse that opened up new possibilities. The way the cages always seemed to open, a release that allowed people to fly.

She wrote down the things that made people feel like they were home. The way the familiar always seemed to welcome, a warmth that wrapped people in comfort. The way the safe always seemed to embrace, a protection that allowed people to rest. The way the loved always seemed to hold, a connection that made people feel like they belonged.
