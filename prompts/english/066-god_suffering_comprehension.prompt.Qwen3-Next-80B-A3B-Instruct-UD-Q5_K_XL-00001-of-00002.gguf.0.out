1. The main thesis is that suffering and evil are not external realities imposed by God, but subjective choices we make in how we perceive and engage with reality—since God creates everything, including our capacity to experience suffering, our perception of evil is ultimately a personal, chosen lens, not an external truth imposed by God.

2. I disagree. While perspective shapes experience, reducing suffering to a “choice” ignores systemic, objective harms—poverty, disease, violence—that exist independently of perception. To call suffering a “choice” risks victim-blaming and ignores the material realities that constrain agency.

3.  
You say the world is what you choose to see,  
A dream you made, a thought, a plea.  
But children starve in silent streets,  
And pain’s not chosen—it’s felt, not free.  
You say the world is just your view—  
But blood still stains the ground you tread.  
The soul may choose to see or hide,  
But grief don’t ask—just cries, and bides. [end of text]
