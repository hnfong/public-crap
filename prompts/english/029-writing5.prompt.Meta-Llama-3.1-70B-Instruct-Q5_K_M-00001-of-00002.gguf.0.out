I sit in class, try to focus on teacher's lesson, but my mind always wander to forest. I am wood elf, but nobody in school know. I keep it secret, even from my best friend, Emily.

My name is Elara, but in school, everyone call me Elly. I try to blend in, wear same uniform as everyone else, but sometimes I feel like I don't belong. My ears, they are little pointy, and my eyes, they see in dark. I have to be careful, or people will notice.

In class, I sit near window, so I can see trees outside. I love trees, they remind me of home. I come from forest, where my people live. We live in harmony with nature, and I miss it so much. But my parents, they want me to learn human way, so I can help our people in future.

I try to pay attention, but teacher's voice sound like buzzing in my ear. I think about forest, and my friends there. We play in river, and climb trees. We are free. Here, I feel trapped.

But I have Emily, she is my friend. She don't know my secret, but she is kind to me. We sit together at lunch, and she teach me about human things. I teach her about forest, but I don't tell her about my people.

One day, we have project in class. We have to make presentation about our favorite place. I want to talk about forest, but I'm scared. What if people find out? What if they don't understand?

I talk to Emily, and she say I should do it. She say it's okay to be different. I take deep breath, and decide to do it.

I make presentation, and I show pictures of forest. I talk about trees, and river, and my people. I'm nervous, but when I finish, everyone clap. They like it, and they ask me questions.

I feel happy, and relieved. Maybe it's okay to be different. Maybe I can be myself, even in human world. Emily smile at me, and I know she is happy for me.

I still have to be careful, but I feel like I can be myself a little more. I am Elly, and I am wood elf. And that's okay. [end of text]
