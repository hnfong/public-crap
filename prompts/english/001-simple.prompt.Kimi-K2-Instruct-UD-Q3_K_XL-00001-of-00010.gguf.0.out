1. One thousand.  
   The first whole number whose English spelling contains the letter “A” is **one thous**a**nd**.

2. “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”  
   The sentence is famous for being a **pangram**—it contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once.

3. A short story:  
Once upon a time, three little pigs—Pip, Pop, and Pebble—were trotting through the forest to visit their cousin in the next glade. On the path they met Little Red Riding Hood, who was hurrying to Grandma’s cottage with a basket of jam tarts.  
“Mind the wolf,” she warned. “He’s been seen near the brick bridge.”  
The pigs thanked her and offered to walk together; there is safety in numbers. Halfway there, the wolf sprang from the shadows, but the pigs squealed so loudly that woodcutters came running, and Little Red swung her sturdy basket with surprising force. Startled, the wolf tumbled into the river.  
Grateful, Little Red shared her tarts with the pigs, and they escorted her safely to Grandma’s door. From then on, every Sunday the pigs, Little Red, and Grandma shared breakfast—no wolves allowed. [end of text]
