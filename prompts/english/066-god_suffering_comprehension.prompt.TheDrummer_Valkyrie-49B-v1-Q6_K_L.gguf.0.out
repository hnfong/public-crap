1. The main thesis is that God exists and creates everything, including suffering. However, we choose our own subjective experiences, including suffering and evil, by believing in them. We have agency to change our experiences.

2. I don't agree. The text oversimplifies complex issues like suffering and evil, implying they are merely personal choices. Many people, especially those experiencing trauma or oppression, do not have the agency to simply "choose" a different reality.

3. A short poem based on the text:

God creates all, a vast design,
Including suffering, a painful sign.
But we choose to see it, to feel the pain,
By believing in evil, in suffering's refrain.

We have the power, the agency to shift,
To change our perspective, to alter our shift.
But for some, the trauma runs too deep,
Their choices limited, their pain they can't sleep. [end of text]
