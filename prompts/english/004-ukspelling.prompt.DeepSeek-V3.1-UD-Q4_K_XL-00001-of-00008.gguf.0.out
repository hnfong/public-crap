The rainbow I like best isn't the one in the sky. It’s the one that appears on our kitchen wall on sunny mornings.

When the sun is just right, my mum’s favourite glass ornament by the window catches the light. It throws tiny rainbows everywhere! One dances on the ceiling, another slides across the fridge.

My little sister and I try to catch them. We jump and reach, but the colours always slip through our fingers. They are shy and quick.

Mum says it’s a bit of magic to start our day. I think she’s right. It’s our own special rainbow, and it only comes to visit us. [end of text]
