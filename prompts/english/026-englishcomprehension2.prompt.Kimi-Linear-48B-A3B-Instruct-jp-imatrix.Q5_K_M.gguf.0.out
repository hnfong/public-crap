We have a puzzle. Let's parse the problem.

"There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block."

Interpretation: There is a stack of blocks. At the top, there are three black blocks stacked on top of each other. Beneath them (i.e., below the three black blocks) there is a blue block. So the stack from top to bottom is: black, black, black, blue. The block we don't know the color of is the one beneath the three black blocks? Or maybe it's the block that is not known? Let's parse: "There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block." So we have a block (call it X) whose color we don't know. On top of X, there are three black blocks. Beneath X, there is a blue block. So the stack from top to bottom: black, black, black, X (unknown color), blue. So X is between the three black blocks and the blue block.

Then: "We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of blue block."

Interpretation: We remove all blocks (i.e., we take them apart) and shuffle them (i.e., randomize the order) with one additional green block (so we have the original blocks plus a green block). Then we put them back on top of each other (i.e., we stack them again). The yellow block is on top of the blue block.

We need to determine the color of the block we don't know the color of (the unknown block X). Only answer in one word. No explanation.

We need to deduce the color of X based on the given constraints.

We have a set of blocks: three black blocks, one unknown block (color unknown), one blue block, and one green block (added). So total blocks: 3 black + unknown + blue + green = 5 blocks? Wait, we have 3 black blocks, unknown block, blue block, green block. That's 5 blocks. But the puzzle says "We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block". So we have the original blocks (including the unknown block) plus an additional green block. So total blocks: 3 black + unknown + blue + green = 5 blocks. Then we shuffle them and stack them again. The yellow block is on top of the blue block.

We need to find the color of the unknown block.

We need to consider the constraints: The unknown block is somewhere in the stack after shuffling. The yellow block is on top of the blue block. The blue block is somewhere in the stack. The unknown block is somewhere else. The three black blocks are somewhere else.

We need to deduce the color of the unknown block based on the fact that the yellow block is on top of the blue block. Possibly the unknown block is yellow? Or maybe it's something else.

We need to think about the puzzle's logic. It might be a classic logic puzzle about colors and stacking. The unknown block could be yellow, because the yellow block is on top of the blue block, and the unknown block is somewhere else. But we need to consider the constraints: The unknown block is not known, but we have a green block added. The puzzle might be about the fact that the unknown block must be yellow because the only color left that can be on top of blue is yellow? But we have green also. Let's think.

We have blocks: black (3), unknown (color unknown), blue, green. After shuffling, we stack them. The yellow block is on top of the blue block. So the topmost block is yellow, and the block directly beneath it is blue. So the top two blocks are yellow (top) and blue (second). The rest of the stack (below blue) can be any arrangement of the remaining blocks: three black blocks, unknown block, green block.

We need to find the color of the unknown block. The unknown block could be any of the colors: black, blue, green, or maybe yellow? But we have only one yellow block (the top block). So the unknown block cannot be yellow because we already have a yellow block on top. But maybe the unknown block could be yellow if there are multiple yellow blocks? The puzzle says "The yellow block is on top of blue block." It doesn't say there is only one yellow block. It just says "the yellow block". Could be multiple yellow blocks? But we have only one green block added, and we have three black blocks, unknown block, blue block. So we have at most one yellow block? Actually we have no mention of yellow blocks originally. The only yellow block is the one that appears after shuffling. So there is exactly one yellow block in the final stack. So the unknown block cannot be yellow because we already have a yellow block on top. But maybe the unknown block could be yellow if the yellow block is not the top block? Wait, the puzzle says "The yellow block is on top of blue block." That implies the yellow block is directly above the blue block. So the top block is yellow, the second block is blue. So the unknown block cannot be yellow because we already have a yellow block on top. But maybe the unknown block could be yellow if the unknown block is the same as the yellow block? No, each block is distinct. So unknown block cannot be yellow.

Thus unknown block is not yellow.

Now, what about the unknown block's color? It could be black, blue, green, or maybe something else? The only colors we have are black, blue, green, and unknown (which could be any of those). But we have three black blocks already, so unknown cannot be black because we already have three black blocks. But maybe the unknown block could be black if we have more than three black blocks? The puzzle says "There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of". So there are exactly three black blocks. So unknown cannot be black because we already have three black blocks. So unknown cannot be black.

Thus unknown cannot be black, cannot be yellow (since we have a yellow block on top). So unknown must be either blue or green.

But we have a blue block already. So unknown cannot be blue because we already have a blue block. But maybe the unknown block could be blue if there are multiple blue blocks? The puzzle says "beneath them there is a blue block." It doesn't say there is only one blue block. It just says there is a blue block. So there could be multiple blue blocks. But we have only one blue block mentioned originally. However, after adding a green block, we have a total of 5 blocks: 3 black, unknown, blue, green. So there is exactly one blue block originally. But after adding green, we have one blue block. So unknown cannot be blue because we already have a blue block. But maybe the unknown block could be blue if the blue block is not the same as the unknown block? But we have only one blue block. So unknown cannot be blue.

Thus unknown cannot be black, cannot be yellow, cannot be blue. So unknown must be green.

Thus the unknown block is green.

But we need to check if any other constraints could allow unknown to be something else. Let's examine the puzzle more carefully.

The puzzle says: "There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block." So we have a stack: black, black, black, unknown, blue. So unknown is between black and blue.

Then: "We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of blue block."

Interpretation: We remove all blocks (i.e., we take them apart) and shuffle them (i.e., randomize the order) with one additional green block (so we have the original blocks plus a green block). Then we put them back on top of each other (i.e., we stack them again). The yellow block is on top of blue block.

Thus after shuffling, we have a stack of 5 blocks (including the green block). The top block is yellow, the second block is blue. The rest of the stack (below blue) can be any arrangement of the remaining blocks: three black blocks, unknown block, green block.

We need to find the color of the unknown block.

We have to consider that the unknown block could be any color, but we have constraints: The unknown block cannot be black because we already have three black blocks. The unknown block cannot be yellow because we have a yellow block on top. The unknown block cannot be blue because we have a blue block (the second block). So unknown must be green.

Thus answer: green.

But we need to be careful: Could the unknown block be black if we consider that the three black blocks are not necessarily all black? The puzzle says "There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of". It doesn't say that the three black blocks are distinct from each other? It says "3 black blocks". So they are black. So unknown cannot be black.

Could the unknown block be yellow? The puzzle says "The yellow block is on top of blue block." It doesn't say there is only one yellow block. But we have only one yellow block in the final stack. However, could there be multiple yellow blocks? The puzzle doesn't specify that there is only one yellow block. It just says "the yellow block". It could be that there are multiple yellow blocks, but we only know that one of them is on top of the blue block. But we have only one green block added, and we have three black blocks, unknown block, blue block. So we have at most one yellow block? Actually we have no mention of yellow blocks originally. So the only yellow block is the one that appears after shuffling. So there is exactly one yellow block. So unknown cannot be yellow.

Thus unknown must be green.

Thus answer: green.

But we need to check if any other constraints could allow unknown to be something else like "blue"? Let's examine the possibility that the unknown block could be blue if we consider that the blue block is not necessarily the same as the unknown block. But we have only one blue block originally. However, after adding green, we have a total of 5 blocks: 3 black, unknown, blue, green. So there is exactly one
