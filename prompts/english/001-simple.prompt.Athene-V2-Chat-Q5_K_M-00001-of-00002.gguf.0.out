### 1. How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?

You would have to count to **1,000** (one thousand) before you encounter the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number. The numbers from one to nine hundred ninety-nine do not contain the letter "A."

### 2. Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox ..."; What is the sentence famous for?

The complete sentence is: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

This sentence is famous for being a **pangram**—a sentence that contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once. It has been widely used for typing practice, font displays, and other purposes where a comprehensive set of letters is needed.

### 3. Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.

Once upon a time, in a dense forest, the three little pigs—Tom, Dick, and Harry—had built their homes to protect themselves from the big, bad wolf. Tom's house was made of straw, Dick's of sticks, and Harry's of bricks. After their encounter with the wolf, they decided to visit each other more often to ensure they were all safe.

One sunny afternoon, as Harry was enjoying a cup of tea in his brick house, he heard a knock at the door. "Who's there?" he called out, still cautious after his previous run-ins with the wolf.

"It's Little Red Riding Hood," came a soft, gentle voice. "May I come in? I'm lost and need some help."

Harry opened the door to find a young girl in a red cloak, carrying a basket. "Of course, come in! Are you okay?" he asked, inviting her inside.

Little Red Riding Hood, whose name was Rose, explained that she was on her way to visit her grandmother but had taken a wrong turn and ended up in the forest. She was frightened and didn't know the way back.

Just then, Tom and Dick arrived, having heard that someone was at Harry's house. They welcomed Rose and offered to help her find her way. The three pigs decided to accompany her to her grandmother's house, ensuring she would be safe from any dangers in the forest.

As they walked, they chatted and shared stories. Rose told them about her grandmother's delicious pies, and the pigs shared their adventures with the big, bad wolf. They laughed and enjoyed each other's company, and the journey seemed much shorter.

Suddenly, they heard a growl. The big, bad wolf appeared, eyeing them hungrily. The pigs stood their ground, remembering their past experiences. Harry, the bravest of the three, stepped forward and said, "We won't let you hurt us or Little Red Riding Hood!"

The wolf, seeing the united front and remembering his previous failures, hesitated. Rose, who had been quietly observing, pulled a whistle from her basket and blew it loudly. The sound echoed through the forest, and to their surprise, a group of friendly forest animals appeared, ready to help.

The wolf, outnumbered and outsmarted, slunk away, vowing never to return. The animals escorted Rose and the pigs safely to her grandmother's house, where they were greeted with warm hugs and a feast of pies.

Rose thanked the pigs for their bravery and kindness. The pigs, feeling proud and happy, promised to visit her and her grandmother often. From that day on, the forest was a safer place, and the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became the best of friends, always ready to help each other in times of need. [end of text]
