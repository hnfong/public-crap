**Whispers of the Willow**

By Li Wing Yan (that’s me!)

I never thought I’d be writing this. But since no one really reads my diary except maybe my cat, Mochi (he’s very judgmental, but loyal), I figure it’s safe. I’m just a normal 16-year-old from Tai Hang—studying hard for the HKDSE, eating pineapple buns after school, and pretending to care about basketball during PE. But the truth? I’m not entirely human.

Okay, before you roll your eyes, hear me out. I’m not a wizard or a mutant. I’m a *wood elf*. Not the pointy-eared fantasy kind you see in movies—no capes, no glowing swords—but the kind who blends in. We live among humans, walk the same streets, sit in the same classroom. We just age slower, hear things others don’t, and feel the pulse of the forest even in the middle of Kowloon.

My secret started when I was five. I’d wander into the woods behind our old flat in Fanling, not because I was lost (I wasn’t), but because the trees *called* me. The rustle of bamboo sounded like whispers. The scent of rain on soil felt like a language. And once, I touched a fallen camphor leaf and saw a memory—not mine—of a squirrel burying nuts in 1987. My mom thought I had a vivid imagination. She was half right.

Now, at St. Clare’s Girls’ College, I wear the uniform like armor: navy blue blazer, pleated skirt, white blouse. I tie my hair in a neat braid, smile politely at teachers, and take notes in neat cursive. But inside? I’m always listening. Not just to Mr. Wong’s physics lecture (which honestly, is kinda boring—why do we need to know the refractive index of diamond again?), but to the *other* sounds.

Like the soft tap-tap-tap of a woodpecker nesting in the ginkgo tree outside Classroom C. Or the way the ivy on the school’s old chapel seems to shift when the wind changes. And sometimes—just sometimes—when I stand by the biology lab’s open window at noon, I can smell the ozone from the fume hood mixed with something older: damp moss, and the faint sweetness of night-blooming cereus from the school garden. That’s when I remember.

I don’t sleep like others. I don’t *need* to. I rest in dappled sunlight behind the music room, wrapped in my favorite green hoodie that smells like rain and cedar. I eat less, crave raw honey and acorns (which I buy from a health food store in Causeway Bay—no one asks questions if you say you’re “trying a paleo diet”). And I heal. Fast. When I scraped my knee jumping over a puddle last month, it was fully gone by breakfast. My best friend, Mei Ling, jokes I’m “built like a Nokia phone—indestructible.” She has no idea.

The hardest part? Watching seasons change and knowing I won’t age with them. While my classmates grow taller, develop curves, get boyfriends and acne, I stay… almost the same. My ears still sometimes itch. My eyes still catch the silver glint of moonlight on dew when I walk home at night. And every autumn, when the ginkgo leaves turn gold and fall like confetti, I ache. Because I remember when this spot was just saplings. When the land breathed differently.

I keep my distance. No sleepovers—too many questions about why I never get cold. No late-night calls—what if someone hears me humming in Elvish under my breath? But Mei Ling’s my anchor. She knows I’m quiet, sometimes distracted. She just thinks I’m “overthinking,” like most people do. Once, she found me staring at a pigeon feather stuck to the fence. “You okay, Yuki?” she asked. I just smiled. “Yeah. Just… appreciating nature.” She rolled her eyes but didn’t push.

The only person who might suspect? Mr. Cheung, our retired biology teacher who volunteers at the school garden. He’s in his seventies, has a beard like a wizard’s, and once told me, “Woods have memories, girl. And sometimes, they choose someone to remember them.” He never said it directly. But when I helped him plant a sapling of *Liquidambar formosana* (Taiwan sweetgum), he touched the bark and whispered, “You feel it too, don’t you?” I nodded. He smiled. “Then you’re not alone.”

So here I am—Yuki Chan, average student, mediocre violinist, occasional daydreamer. But also Elara Moonshade (secretly), guardian of forgotten roots, listener of silent groves. I’ll graduate next year, go to university, maybe become a landscape architect. Something to honor the land. And when I walk across the stage, I’ll wear my cap and gown… but beneath it? A thread of woven willow, invisible to all but the wind.

Because even in a city of seven million, some souls still hear the forest.

And we keep the whispers alive.

P.S. If you ever see a tiny mushroom ring glowing faintly green in the school courtyard at midnight… don’t touch it. And maybe leave a honey biscuit. Just in case. [end of text]
