3. **A Short Story of the Three Little Pigs and Little Red Riding Hood**

Once upon a time, in a dense forest, there lived three little pigs: Peter, Paul, and Patty. They had built their homes from straw, sticks, and bricks, respectively, to protect themselves from the big, bad wolf who roamed the woods.

One sunny morning, Little Red Riding Hood was on her way to visit her grandmother, carrying a basket of goodies. As she walked through the forest, she noticed the three little pigs' houses. Curious, she decided to stop by and say hello.

First, she visited Peter's house made of straw. Peter was inside, nervously looking out the window. "Hello, Peter! I'm Little Red Riding Hood. Can I come in?" she asked. Peter, scared of the wolf, hesitated but then opened the door a crack. "I'm on my way to see my grandmother. It's such a beautiful day, isn't it?" she said with a smile. Peter nodded, but his eyes darted around, worried about the wolf.

Next, she went to Paul's house made of sticks. Paul was also inside, peeking through the cracks. "Hello, Paul! Can I come in?" she asked. Paul, a bit more confident, opened the door a bit wider. "I'm on my way to see my grandmother. Do you want to come with me?" she offered. Paul shook his head, still wary of the wolf.

Finally, she arrived at Patty's house made of bricks. Patty was inside, reading a book. "Hello, Patty! Can I come in?" she asked. Patty, the most confident of the three, opened the door and invited her in. "Of course! Please come in. I'm not afraid of the wolf," she said proudly. Little Red Riding Hood sat down, and they chatted about the forest and the wolf.

As they talked, they heard a loud knock on the door. "Open up, little pigs! It's the big, bad wolf!" growled a voice. Patty, without a moment's hesitation, stood up and said, "Not by the hair of my chinny-chin-chin!" The wolf, frustrated, tried to blow the house down, but the bricks were too strong.

Little Red Riding Hood, who had been listening, said, "I have an idea! Let's work together to outsmart the wolf." She and Patty quickly came up with a plan. They lit a fire and placed a pot of boiling water near the door. When the wolf tried to break in, he slipped and fell into the pot, scaring him away for good.

The three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood celebrated their victory. They realized that by working together, they could overcome any challenge. Little Red Riding Hood continued on her way to her grandmother's house, feeling safer and more confident, while the three little pigs felt a sense of pride and camaraderie.

And they all lived happily ever after. [end of text]
