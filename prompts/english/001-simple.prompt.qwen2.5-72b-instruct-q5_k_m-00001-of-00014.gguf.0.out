### 1. How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?

The first whole number that includes the letter "A" in its English spelling is **1000** (one thousand).

### 2. Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox ..."; What is the sentence famous for?

The complete sentence is: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

This sentence is famous because it is a **pangram**—a sentence that contains every letter of the English alphabet. It is often used for typing practice and in font displays.

### 3. Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.

Once upon a time, in a dense forest, the three little pigs—Tom, Dick, and Harry—decided to build their own homes to live independently. Tom built his house out of straw, Dick used sticks, and Harry, the most diligent of the three, built his house out of bricks.

One sunny morning, as the pigs were settling into their new homes, they heard a soft knock on their doors. Curious, they peeked out and saw a young girl in a red hood, carrying a basket. It was Little Red Riding Hood, on her way to visit her grandmother.

"Hello, little pigs," she said with a smile. "I'm Little Red Riding Hood. I'm on my way to my grandmother's house, but I'm a bit lost. Could you help me find the right path?"

The pigs, being kind-hearted, invited her inside to rest and offered to help her find her way. Tom, being the most adventurous, suggested they all go together to ensure she was safe.

As they walked through the forest, they noticed a shadowy figure lurking behind the trees. It was the Big Bad Wolf, who had been eyeing the pigs for a long time. The wolf, seeing Little Red Riding Hood, decided to try his luck with her as well.

"Watch out, Little Red Riding Hood!" Harry shouted, warning her of the danger. The pigs, using their wits and strength, managed to chase the wolf away. Harry, with his brick house, even built a small fort to protect them from any further attacks.

Grateful for their help, Little Red Riding Hood thanked the pigs and continued on her way to her grandmother's house, feeling much safer. The pigs, feeling proud of their bravery, returned to their homes, knowing they had made a new friend and protected someone in need.

From that day on, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood remained good friends, often visiting each other and sharing stories of their adventures in the forest. And the Big Bad Wolf never dared to trouble them again.
