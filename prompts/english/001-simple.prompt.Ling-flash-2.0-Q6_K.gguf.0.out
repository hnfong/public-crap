**3. Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.**

**Title: The Wolf’s Double Trouble**

Once upon a time, in a quiet village nestled between the forest and the hills, three little pigs decided to build their homes. The first pig built a straw house, the second a stick house, and the third a sturdy brick house — just like the stories.

One sunny afternoon, as the pigs were admiring their handiwork, a girl in a red cloak skipped through the woods. Little Red Riding Hood was on her way to her grandmother’s house, carrying a basket of goodies. She stumbled upon the pigs' neighborhood and, curious as children often are, decided to stop and say hello.

“Hello there!” she called. “What are you building?”

“We’re making homes!” said the first pig, wiping sweat from his brow. “I’m building with straw!”

“Me next!” said the second pig, hammering sticks together. “I’m using sticks!”

“And I’m using bricks!” said the third pig, laying the final stone. “You never know when trouble might come.”

Just then, a low growl echoed through the trees. Out stepped the Big Bad Wolf, his belly rumbling. He had already blown down the first pig’s straw house and tricked the second pig’s stick house. But now, he faced something new: three pigs and a clever girl in red.

“Let me in!” growled the wolf, trying the straw door. But the brick house stood firm.

Little Red Riding Hood, quick on her feet, said, “Wait! I know a trick.” She pulled out a whistle from her basket — a magical one, left by her grandmother, a wise old witch.

She blew it sharply. *Toot-toot!*

Suddenly, the trees rustled. Out jumped the **Three Little Chicks**, who had been hiding nearby. They began pecking at the wolf’s feet, distracting him. Then, the pigs — led by the third pig, who had kept a secret stash of wolf-repelling pepper — tossed handfuls into the air.

The wolf sneezed violently, tripped over a root, and tumbled into the mud.

Red Riding Hood tied his paws with her red ribbon. “Next time,” she said wisely, “eat something healthier.”

The three pigs and Little Red Riding Hood laughed together. From that day on, they became the best of friends — the Brick Trio and the Red Ranger — always ready to outsmart any wolf who came their way.

And they all lived huffing, puffing, and happily ever after.

✅ **The End**
