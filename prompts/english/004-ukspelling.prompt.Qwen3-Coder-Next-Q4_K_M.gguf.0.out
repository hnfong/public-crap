My favourite rainbows aren’t in the sky—they’re in the garden after a summer shower.

The sun peeks out, warm and golden, and the raindrops clinging to the rose leaves catch the light. Each drop becomes a tiny, wobbly prism, splitting the sunlight into bright bands of colour: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. They shimmer like jewels on the leaves, dancing as the breeze gently shakes the branches.

Sometimes, if I stand just right—with my back to the sun and my eyes low—I see a perfect little rainbow arching between two wet petals. It’s small enough to fit in my hand, but it glows just as bright as the big ones in the sky.

I love these garden rainbows best because they’re shy and quick. They vanish as the water dries, leaving only dewy grass and the sweet smell of wet earth. But if I wait quietly, another one might appear—just for me. [end of text]
