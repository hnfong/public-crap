**1. Main Thesis**
The text argues that God creates all possibilities without human emotion, serving merely as the neutral substrate for existence, while humans act as vessels of subjective experience. It posits that suffering and evil are not objective truths imposed by God, but rather the result of individual choices regarding what to perceive and believe. Therefore, one's reality—including the existence of suffering—is a subjective construction that can be altered by changing one's perspective or "ignorance."

**2. Agreement**
I disagree with the text’s reasoning. While it offers a compelling framework for personal agency, it relies on a logical extreme that dismisses the objective reality of systemic suffering, such as war or disease, by reducing them to mere "choices" of perception. This perspective fails to account for the lack of agency victims often possess and risks blaming individuals for circumstances beyond their control, rendering the argument ethically unsound regarding real-world atrocities.

**3. Poem**
A vast expanse, a law, a might,
Creates the dark and creates the light.
No human love, but nurture’s frame,
The canvas holds both bliss and shame.

We are the vessels, distinct and small,
Who choose to see the rise and fall.
If suffering comes to cloud the sky,
It is but a lens chosen by the I.

The tiger doll, the phantom pain,
Exist because we weave the chain.
So shift the view, ignore the din,
And let the quieter world begin. [end of text]
