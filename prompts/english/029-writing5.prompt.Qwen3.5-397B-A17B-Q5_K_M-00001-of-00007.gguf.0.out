The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed with a frequency that made Elian's teeth ache. To everyone else, it was just the annoying buzz of old wiring. To Elian, whose ears were currently hidden beneath a thick, messy mop of dark hair and a beanie he refused to take off even in May, it sounded like a swarm of angry hornets trapped in a glass jar.

Elian adjusted his backpack, feeling the weight of the textbooks against his spine. Inside the bag, tucked between his calculus workbook and a half-eaten apple, was a small pouch of dried moss and a vial of rainwater collected from the oak tree in his backyard. It was his lunch. Well, part of it. The other part was a turkey sandwich his mom had packed, which he would eat solely to avoid suspicion.

"Hey, Elian! Wait up!"

The voice belonged to Marcus, a human boy with boundless energy and a penchant for loud sneakers. Elian paused, forcing his posture to slump slightly, mimicking the slouch of a tired teenager rather than the straight, graceful stance of his kin.

"Morning, Marcus," Elian said, his voice carefully modulated to sound less melodic than it naturally wanted to be.

"You look rough, dude. Late night gaming?" Marcus fell into step beside him, nearly knocking over a freshman with his swinging arms.

"Something like that," Elian lied smoothly. In reality, he had spent the night perched on the highest branch of the old pine in the school parking lot, listening to the sap rise and the owls gossip about the migration patterns of the local mice. Sleep was optional for wood elves; communion with the forest was not.

As they walked down the hallway, Elian's senses were overwhelmed. The air smelled of floor wax, stale gym socks, and the sharp, chemical tang of anxiety radiating from the students preparing for midterms. But underneath it all, he could smell something else: the dying potted fern in the principal's office, crying out for water; the termite colony eating away at the doorframe of the library; the single, resilient dandelion pushing through a crack in the asphalt outside the cafeteria window.

It took every ounce of his discipline not to sprint toward that dandelion and sing it a song of encouragement.

"Earth to Elian?" Marcus waved a hand in front of his face. "Bio class. We're gonna be late."

"Right. Biology," Elian muttered.

Biology was the hardest class. Not because of the content—Elian knew more about cellular respiration and photosynthesis than the teacher ever could—but because of the dissection units. Last week, they had dissected frogs. Elian had spent the entire period sweating profusely, whispering silent apologies to the deceased amphibians under his breath, and pretending to gag so he wouldn't have to touch the scalpel.

Today, they were studying plant taxonomy.

"Alright class," Mr. Henderson droned, pointing to a diagram of a leaf structure. "Who can tell me the function of the stomata?"

Silence filled the room. Marcus was picking at a hangnail. The girl in the front row was texting under her desk.

Elian's hand shot up before he could stop it. The movement was too fluid, too eager. He quickly lowered it halfway, trying to look casual.

"Elian?" Mr. Henderson squinted. "Do you know?"

"They regulate gas exchange and transpiration," Elian recited, his eyes glazing over as he visualized the microscopic pores opening and closing like tiny mouths breathing. "But the diagram is wrong. The guard cells on a *Quercus alba* respond to blue light spectrum differently than the textbook suggests, especially in high-humidity environments. And if you look closely at the sample under the microscope, you'll see the mycorrhizal fungi connecting the root systems, which the book completely ignores."

The class stared. Mr. Henderson blinked, adjusting his glasses. "Well. That is... remarkably specific, Elian. Though perhaps a bit beyond the scope of the AP curriculum."

"Just an observation," Elian shrugged, shrinking back into his chair. *Too much,* he thought. *Always too much.*

The real crisis happened during lunch.

Elian usually ate alone behind the bleachers, where the shadow of the football field met a patch of neglected wildflowers. It was the only place in the school grounds that felt somewhat alive. Today, however, a group of seniors had claimed the spot, tossing empty soda cans and crushing the wildflowers under their boots.

Elian felt a surge of heat in his chest, a primal anger that made his fingertips tingle. He could feel the pain of the crushed stems, the severing of their connection to the earth. It was a physical ache in his own bones.

He watched from behind the chain-link fence as a senior kicked a clump of purple coneflowers, sending petals scattering into the dirt.

That was it.

Elian waited until the group moved toward the cafeteria, laughing and shoving each other. Once the coast was clear, he slipped through the gap in the fence. He knelt beside the battered flowers. They were wilting rapidly, their life force leaking away.

"Shh," Elian whispered, his voice dropping into the low, resonant timber of the Old Tongue. "I am here."

He placed his palms on the soil. He closed his eyes and reached out, not with his hands, but with his spirit. He found the faint, flickering pulse of the plants. It was weak, terrified.

*Hold on,* he projected the thought. *Let the sun find you again.*

A soft, golden light emanated from his palms, invisible to the human eye but blindingly bright to anything attuned to nature. He pulled moisture from the deep underground aquifers, channeling it through his arms and into the dry earth. He sang a silent melody, a tune of growth and resilience that had been passed down through generations of his people.

Slowly, miraculously, the crushed stems straightened. The torn leaves knit themselves together. The purple petals regained their vibrant hue, seeming to glow in the afternoon sun. Within seconds, the patch of flowers looked healthier than it had all year.

Elian pulled his hands back, panting slightly. The effort always drained him, like running a sprint. He quickly brushed the dirt off his jeans and checked his beanie. Still secure. Good.

"Whoa."

Elian froze. He spun around.

Standing by the fence was Sarah, a quiet girl from his art class who always smelled like charcoal and turpentine. She was staring at the flowers, then at Elian, her eyes wide.

"I... I saw that," she stammered. "The flowers. They were dead. Then you touched them, and they..."

Elian's heart hammered against his ribs like a trapped bird. *She knows. She knows I'm not human. They'll take me away. Or worse, they'll put me in a lab.*

"You must have imagined it," Elian said, his voice tight. "Maybe the sun hit them at the right angle. A trick of the light."

Sarah took a step closer. She didn't look scared; she looked fascinated. She looked down at the flowers, then back at Elian's hands. "My grandma used to tell stories," she said softly. "About people who could talk to trees. She said they had ears that were pointed, hidden under hats."

Elian instinctively reached up to touch his beanie.

Sarah smiled, a small, secretive smile. "I won't tell anyone, Elian. But... could you maybe help me with my art project? I'm trying to draw the life cycle of the oak tree, but I can never get the feeling of it right. I think... I think you could help me see it."

Elian stared at her. The fear in his chest began to recede, replaced by a cautious curiosity. Humans were loud and clumsy and destructive, yes. But sometimes, like Sarah, they noticed things. Sometimes, they listened.

"I don't know," Elian hesitated, glancing toward the school building where the bell was about to ring. "It's complicated."

"I know," Sarah said. "But the world is complicated. And those flowers?" She gestured to the vibrant patch. "They look happy."

Elian looked at the flowers. They did look happy. They were swaying gently in the breeze, as if bowing to him. A small smile tugged at the corner of his mouth, genuine and unguarded.

"Okay," Elian said, pulling his beanie down just a fraction lower, though he knew, somehow, that with Sarah, he might not need to hide quite so much. "Meet me here tomorrow. Bring your sketchbook. And don't be late."

As they walked back toward the school, the fluorescent hum of the hallway still grated on Elian's nerves, and the smell of floor wax was still overpowering. But as he passed the potted fern in the principal's office, he subtly brushed his hand against the wall near it, sending a tiny pulse of energy through the plaster.

Inside the office, the fern perked up, its leaves turning a deeper shade of green.

Elian walked on, blending in with the crowd of teenagers, a secret guardian of the wild hidden in plain sight, ready to face another day of algebra and hidden magic. [end of text]
