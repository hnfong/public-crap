1. The main thesis of the text is that God, as the creator of everything, has properties that are beyond human understanding and that our subjective experiences, including suffering, are a result of our choices and perspectives. The text argues that our experiences are shaped by our beliefs and decisions, and that suffering and evil are perceived as such because we choose to see them that way.

2. I agree to an extent. The text presents an interesting perspective on the role of personal choice and perception in our experiences, but it oversimplifies the complex nature of suffering and evil. While our perceptions and beliefs can shape our experiences, they do not fully account for the systemic and external factors that contribute to suffering.

3. In realms of thought, we choose our plight,  
Perception's lens shapes dark from light.  
God's vast design, beyond our grasp,  
Our choices weave, our fates unclasp. [end of text]
