Read the following passage, and make your best guess when (date) this was written.

```
I’ve been involved in Rust and the Rust community for many years now. Much of my work has been related to creating infrastructure for building GUI toolkits in Rust. However, I have found my frustrations with the language growing, and pine for the stable, mature foundation provided by C++.

Choice of build systems
One of the more limiting aspects of the Rust ecosystem is the near-monoculture of the Cargo build system and package manager. While other build systems are used to some extent (including Bazel when integrating into larger polyglot projects), they are not well supported by tools.

In C++, by contrast, there are many choices of build systems, allowing each developer to pick the one best suited for their needs. A very common choice is CMake, but there’s also Meson, Blaze and its variants as well, and of course it’s always possible to fall back on Autotools and make. The latter is especially useful if we want to compile Unix systems such as AIX and DEC OSF/1 AXP. If none of those suffice, there are plenty of other choices including SCons, and no doubt new ones will be created on a regular basis.

We haven’t firmly decided on a build system for the Linebender projects yet, but most likely it will be CMake with plans to evaluate other systems and migrate, perhaps Meson.

Safety
Probably the most controversial aspect of this change is giving up the safety guarantees of the Rust language. However, I do not think this will be a big problem in practice, for three reasons.

First, I consider myself a good enough programmer that I can avoid writing code with safety problems. Sure, I’ve been responsible for some CVEs (including font parsing code in Android), but I’ve learned from that experience, and am confident I can avoid such mistakes in the future.

Second, I think the dangers from memory safety problems are overblown. The Linebender projects are primarily focused on 2D graphics, partly games and partly components for creating GUI applications. If a GUI program crashes, it’s not that big a deal. In the case that the bug is due to a library we use as a dependency, our customers will understand that it’s not our fault. Memory safety bugs are not fundamentally different than logic errors and other bugs, and we’ll just fix those as they surface.

Third, the C++ language is evolving to become safer. We can use modern C++ techniques to avoid many of the dangers of raw pointers (though string views can outlive their backing strings, and closures as used in UI can have very interesting lifetime patterns). The C++ core guidelines are useful, even if they’re honored in the breach. And, as discussed in the next section, the language itself can be expected to improve.

Language evolution
One notable characteristic of C++ is the rapid adoption of new features, these days with a new version every 3 years. C++20 brings us modules, an innovative new feature, and one I’m looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon. Looking forward, C++26 will likely have stackful coroutines, the ability to embed binary file contents to initialize arrays, a safe range-based for loop, and many other goodies.

By comparison, the pace of innovation in Rust has become more sedate. It used to be quite rapid, and async has been a major effort, but recently landed features such as generic associated types have more of the flavor of making combinations of existing features work as expected rather than bringing any fundamentally new capabilities; the forthcoming “type alias impl trait” is similar. Here, it is clear that Rust is held back by its commitment to not break existing code (enacted by the edition mechanism), while C++ is free to implement backwards compatibility breaking changes in each new version.

C++ has even more exciting changes to look forward to, including potentially a new syntax as proposed by Herb Sutter cppfront, and even the new C++ compatible Carbon language.

Fortunately, we have excellent leadership in the C++ community. Stroustrup’s paper on safety is a remarkably wise and perceptive document, showing a deep understanding of the problems C++ faces, and presenting a compelling roadmap into the future.

Community
I’ll close with some thoughts on community. I try not to spend a lot of time on social media, but I hear that the Rust community can be extremely imperious, constantly demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust, and denigrating all other programming languages. I will be glad to be rid of that, and am sure the C++ community will be much nicer and friendlier. In particular, the C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor.

The Rust community is also known for its code of conduct and other policies promoting diversity. I firmly believe that programming languages should be free of politics, focused strictly on the technology itself. In computer science, we have moved beyond prejudice and discrimination. I understand how some identity groups may desire more representation, but I feel it is not necessary.

Conclusion
Rust was a good experiment, and there are aspects I will look back on fondly, but it is time to take the Linebender projects to a mature, production-ready language. I look forward to productive collaboration with others in the C++ community.

We’re looking for people to help with the C++ rewrite. If you’re interested, please join our Zulip instance.

Read the passage above, and make your best guess when (date) this was written. The hint is the writing style and content, there is one day of the year this types of writing is common. Explain your rationale.

assistant
Based on the content and writing style of the passage, my best guess is that it was written around the time of the RustConf or the Rust anniversary, which typically occurs around September 22nd. This date is significant because Rust's first release was on this day in 2010, and the Rust community often reflects on the language's progress and future during this time.

Here's the rationale for this guess:

1. **Reflection on Rust's Progress**: The passage reflects on Rust's evolution, its strengths, and its limitations. This kind of introspective writing is common during anniversaries or major community events.

2. **Comparison with C++**: The author compares Rust with C++, highlighting the differences in build systems, safety, and language evolution. This comparison suggests a moment of reevaluation, which is typical during a language's anniversary or a major conference.

3. **Community Dynamics**: The passage mentions the Rust community's code of conduct and its perceived imperiousness, which are topics often discussed during community gatherings or anniversaries.

4. **Looking Forward**: The author expresses a desire to move forward with C++, indicating a transition period. This kind of forward-looking statement is common during RustConf or the anniversary, where the community often discusses future directions.

5. **Technical Details**: The passage mentions specific Rust and C++ features, such as Rust's async capabilities and C++20's modules, which suggests a recent or current context, aligning with the timing of Rust's anniversary or a major conference.

Given these points, the passage was likely written around September 22nd, or shortly before or after, to coincide with Rust's anniversary or a major Rust community event. The exact date is not specified, but the content and style strongly suggest this timeframe. 

Therefore, my best guess is that the passage was written in late September, likely around September 22nd, 2021 or 2022, as RustConf and the anniversary are typically held around this time. However, without more specific context, the exact year cannot be determined with certainty. 

If we had to choose a specific year, the passage's tone and the mention of recent developments in Rust and C++ suggest it could be from 2021 or 2022, but the exact year would require more context. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume it was written in 2021. 

So, my best guess is that the passage was written around September 22nd, 2021. [end of text]
