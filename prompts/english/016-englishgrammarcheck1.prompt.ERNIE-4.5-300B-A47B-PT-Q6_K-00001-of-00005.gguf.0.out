Here’s a review of the text, highlighting **grammar mistakes**, **stylistic issues**, and **other problems** (at least 5 per category):

### **Grammar Mistakes (Tense/Agreement Issues)**  
1. **"who I'm sure are mostly diligent"** → Should be **"whom I'm sure are mostly diligent"** (though "who" is colloquially accepted, "whom" is grammatically correct here; alternatively, rephrase to avoid the issue: *"who, I'm sure, are mostly diligent"*).  
2. **"layoff more people"** → Should be **"lay off more people"** ("layoff" is a noun; "lay off" is the verb phrase).  
3. **"McKinsey Pichai"** → Likely a typo/misnomer; should be **"Sundar Pichai"** (CEO of Google/Alphabet).  
4. **"Those who read history knows"** → Should be **"Those who read history know"** (subject-verb agreement: "those" is plural).  
5. **"what their careers would look like in say 20 years"** → Should be **"what their careers would look like in, say, 20 years"** (missing commas around interjection "say").  

### **Serious Stylistic Issues**  
1. **Overuse of parentheses and dashes** → Creates a choppy, informal tone (e.g., *"(who I'm sure are mostly diligent)"*, *"-- in particular META and GOOG."*).  
2. **Inconsistent capitalization of company names** → "META" and "GOOG" are stock tickers, but "Google" should be capitalized as a proper noun (*"GOOG (and particularly Google)"*).  
3. **Colloquial phrasing ("predatory capitalist attitude", "party's gonna end")** → Undermines professionalism; consider more precise terms (e.g., *"exploitative capitalist practices"*, *"the boom will eventually decline"*).  
4. **Redundant phrasing ("exactly on the same line of logic")** → Should be *"along the same lines"* or *"following the same logic"*.  
5. **Abrupt transitions ("With interest rates still held 'high'")** → Lacks smooth segue from previous paragraph; consider a transitional sentence.  

### **Other Problems**  
1. **Unclear antecedents ("they can cut costs by almost half")** → "They" could refer to companies or shareholders; specify (*"the companies can cut costs"*).  
2. **Mixed metaphors ("golden goose", "ruthless capitalist engine")** → Overuse dilutes impact; streamline imagery.  
3. **Inconsistent tone (shifts from analytical to personal anecdote)** → The sudden shift to frugality and career anxiety feels disjointed from earlier capitalist critique.  
4. **Undefined acronyms/terms ("FI")** → "FI" (Financial Independence) should be spelled out on first use.  
5. **Passive voice misuse ("the free money is draining away")** → More direct phrasing (*"easy capital is disappearing"*) would strengthen the argument.  

### **Bonus Suggestions for Clarity**  
- Replace *"enshittification"* (slang) with *"degradation"* or *"decline in quality"*.  
- Avoid *"In America We Trust"* (ironic phrasing) unless intentional; clarify sarcasm if so.  
- Split long paragraphs (e.g., the final block) for readability.
