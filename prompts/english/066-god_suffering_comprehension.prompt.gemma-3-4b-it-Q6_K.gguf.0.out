Okay, here are the answers to your questions and the poem:

**1. Explain the main thesis of the text in at most 3 sentences.**

The text argues that suffering and “evil” are ultimately subjective experiences created by our choices within God’s creation. It suggests that we are vessels experiencing this creation and that our perception of negativity is a result of our own desires and beliefs.  Ultimately, we have the agency to choose our experiences, including the perception of suffering.

**2. Do you agree? Explain but be concise.**

I partially agree. The text presents a compelling perspective on the nature of suffering, suggesting it’s largely a product of our individual choices and interpretations. However, while acknowledging the power of subjective experience, it feels somewhat dismissive of genuine, widespread suffering that exists objectively in the world. It’s a useful framework for personal responsibility, but doesn’t fully address the complexities of systemic injustice and hardship.

**3. Write a short poem (ideally that rhymes) based on the information above.**

Within God’s vast, boundless design,
We’re vessels, experiencing divine.
A choice we make, a path we see,
Shapes our world, for you and me.

Though shadows fall, and sorrows rise,
A subjective truth before our eyes.
To shift our view, to change our plea,
“This is my choice,” eternally. 

Like a toy tiger, a phantom’s plight,
Our beliefs create darkness or light. 
So choose with care, with mindful grace,
And find your peace in this sacred space.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these answers, or perhaps generate a poem with a different style or focus? [end of text]
