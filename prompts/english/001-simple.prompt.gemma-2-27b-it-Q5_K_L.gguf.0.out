Here are the answers to your questions:

1. You would have to count to **one thousand** before you would use the letter "A" in the English spelling of a whole number.

2. "The quick brown fox **jumps over the lazy dog**." This sentence is famous for containing every letter of the English alphabet at least once. It's often used to test typewriters and fonts.

3.  The three little pigs were strolling through the forest, whistling a merry tune, when they bumped into Little Red Riding Hood. She was skipping along, a basket swinging from her arm.

"Well hello there!" chirped the first little pig, his curly tail wagging. "Where are you off to on this fine day?"

Little Red Riding Hood smiled. "I'm on my way to Grandma's house," she said. "She's not feeling well, so I'm bringing her some soup and cookies."

The second little pig, who was always a bit cautious, piped up, "Be careful, Little Red Riding Hood! The woods can be dangerous."

"Oh, I will," she assured him. "Thank you for your concern."

The third little pig, the bravest of the three, offered to walk with her part of the way. Little Red Riding Hood gratefully accepted, and they chatted happily as they walked through the dappled sunlight.

As they parted ways, Little Red Riding Hood thanked the pigs for their kindness. "I'll be careful," she promised.

The three little pigs watched her go, feeling a little bit worried but also hopeful that she would reach Grandma's house safely. They knew that even though the woods could be scary, kindness and friendship could always help overcome any obstacle.
