Here are the answers to your questions:

1. You would have to count to **one thousand** before you would use the letter "A" in the English spelling of a whole number. 

2. "The quick brown fox **jumps over the lazy dog.**" This sentence is famous for containing every letter of the English alphabet at least once. It's often used to test typewriters and fonts.

3.  The three little pigs, huffing and puffing from their latest building project, were strolling through the woods when they bumped into a little girl in a red hooded cloak.

"Well hello there!" said the first little pig, his straw hat askew. "What brings you to these parts?"

The little girl, Little Red Riding Hood, smiled shyly. "I'm on my way to Grandmother's house," she said, "but I seem to be lost."

The second little pig, who had built his house of sticks, piped up, "We know these woods well! We'll show you the way."

The third little pig, whose house was made of sturdy bricks, added, "But be careful, Little Red Riding Hood. There's a wolf about who might try to trick you."

Little Red Riding Hood thanked the pigs and followed them through the winding paths. As they walked, the pigs warned her about the wolf's cunning disguises and told her to be wary of anyone who seemed suspicious.

Little Red Riding Hood, remembering the pigs' warnings, kept a sharp eye out. She arrived safely at her grandmother's house, where she found the wolf disguised as her grandmother. But thanks to the pigs' advice, she was able to outsmart the wolf and escape unharmed.

From that day on, Little Red Riding Hood and the three little pigs became the best of friends, always looking out for each other in the woods.
