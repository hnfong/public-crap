1. The main thesis of the text is that suffering and evil are subjective experiences chosen by individuals within the context of God's creation, which encompasses all possibilities. We are vessels for experiencing this creation, and our subjective experiences, including suffering, are a result of our choices and perspectives. The text suggests that by recognizing our agency, we can change our experiences.

2. I agree that our subjective experiences, including suffering, are influenced by our perspectives and choices. However, I also recognize that external circumstances and systemic issues can significantly impact our ability to choose and change our experiences, which the text may underplay.

3. In a world vast and wide, where all is God's design,  
We choose the paths we tread, in light or shadows we align.  
Suffering, a choice, or so the wise may claim, yet in our hearts, we find the change. [end of text]
