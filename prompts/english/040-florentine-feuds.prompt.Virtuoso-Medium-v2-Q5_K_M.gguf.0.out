Marco's situation is complex and fraught with potential pitfalls. To navigate it successfully, he must carefully balance his obligations to the Albizzi, his need to acquire the specific lapis lazuli, and his desire to maintain his reputation and livelihood in Florence. Here's a strategic course of action for Marco:

1. **Seek a Medici Ally**: Marco should attempt to find a Medici ally who can help him acquire the lapis lazuli without directly involving him in negotiations with a Medici agent. This could be a trusted friend or business associate who has connections to the Medici family. By using an intermediary, Marco can reduce the risk of being directly implicated in any dealings with the Medici.

2. **Maintain Secrecy**: If Marco must negotiate directly with a Medici agent, he should do so in the utmost secrecy. He should choose a location and time for the meeting that minimizes the risk of discovery. He should also ensure that any documentation or correspondence related to the transaction is kept confidential and destroyed after use.

3. **Leverage Clientela**: Marco should leverage his existing *clientela* (network of patrons and clients) to his advantage. He should inform his closest patrons and allies about the situation and seek their advice and support. They may be able to provide him with additional resources or connections that can help him acquire the lapis lazuli without arousing suspicion.

4. **Demonstrate Virtù**: Marco should demonstrate his *virtù* (virtue and excellence) in his work on the reliquary. By producing a masterpiece that exceeds the expectations of the Albizzi, he can strengthen his reputation and standing in Florentine society. This will make it more difficult for the Albizzi to punish him severely if they discover his dealings with the Medici.

5. **Prepare for Contingencies**: Marco should prepare for the possibility that his dealings with the Medici may be discovered. He should have a plan in place for how to respond if the Albizzi confront him about the lapis lazuli. This could include offering to compensate the Albizzi for any inconvenience caused or seeking the intervention of a powerful patron to mediate the situation.

6. **Maintain Reputazione**: Throughout the process, Marco should be mindful of maintaining his *reputazione* (reputation) in Florentine society. He should avoid any actions that could be perceived as disloyal or dishonest. He should also continue to cultivate his relationships with other patrons and clients to ensure that he has a strong support network in case of any difficulties.

By following these steps, Marco can increase his chances of successfully fulfilling the commission and protecting his long-term livelihood and standing in Florence. However, he must remain vigilant and adaptable, as the political and social landscape of Renaissance Florence was constantly shifting. [end of text]
