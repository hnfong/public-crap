1. The text argues that suffering and evil are not objective flaws in a divine creation but subjective experiences shaped by individual choices in perception and belief. Since God creates all possibilities, including suffering, it is ultimately a choice—through belief and attention—that one experiences pain or evil. The author emphasizes personal agency: we are not victims of fate, but active participants in shaping our reality through what we choose to perceive.

2. I find the perspective thought-provoking but overly deterministic. While personal agency and perception matter, dismissing suffering as merely a "choice" risks minimizing real, systemic pain. Many endure trauma beyond their control, and reducing it to subjective belief can be dismissive of genuine human suffering.

3.  
You see the world through your eyes,  
Not God’s, nor fate’s, nor lies.  
You chose the pain, you chose the light—  
The world you feel is yours, not right.  
No ghostly hand, no cruel design,  
Just choices made, and thoughts that shine.  
So if you suffer, know this true:  
You’re not a victim—just a view. [end of text]
