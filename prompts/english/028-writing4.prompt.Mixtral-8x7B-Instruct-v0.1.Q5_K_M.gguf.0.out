Everybody called her Aspirin -- she always looked like she was aspiring to become a special state of being, and just looking at her made your headache go away.

 [/INST] Aspirin, as she was affectionately known by her friends and family, was a woman of extraordinary grace and poise. She had a way of making people feel at ease, and her calming presence was a balm to those around her.

Born in a small town in the Midwest, Aspirin always dreamed of seeing the world and experiencing all it had to offer. She worked hard to save up enough money to travel, and eventually, she set off on a journey that would take her to the farthest corners of the globe.
