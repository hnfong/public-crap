The comment seems to be discussing the concept of inertia in the context of a video game, possibly Super Mario. Here's a breakdown:

1. "Inertia of running": Inertia is a physical property that describes an object's resistance to changes in its state of motion. In the context of a video game, this could refer to the way a character's movement continues even after the player stops pressing the movement buttons.

2. "Makes Mario slip": This suggests that the inertia of Mario's running is causing him to lose control and slip. This could be due to the game's physics engine, which might not handle inertia perfectly, or it could be a deliberate design choice to add challenge to the game.

3. "Into the abyss": The "abyss" likely refers to a hazard or pit in the game that Mario could fall into if he loses control. This could lead to a game over or a loss of progress.

4. "Skill issue": This suggests that the problem is not with the game's mechanics, but with the player's ability to control Mario. It could be that the player is not used to the game's physics or is not skilled enough to navigate the environment effectively.

In summary, the comment seems to be expressing frustration with a game mechanic that is causing the player to lose control of their character and fall into a hazard. The player feels that this is a skill issue, rather than a problem with the game's design. [end of text]
