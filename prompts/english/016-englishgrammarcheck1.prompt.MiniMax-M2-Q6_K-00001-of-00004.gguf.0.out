### Grammar and agreement issues

1. **“And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault”** – “to” should be “on”: “seem like an unwarranted assault on the work ethic.”
2. **“who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking”** – “who” should be “who” for people, but the clause is awkward; better: “who, I’m sure, are mostly diligent and hardworking.”
3. **“I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something”** – “but” is redundant; “I can’t help but agree” is idiomatic, but “I can’t help agreeing” is smoother.
4. **“back when tech stocks were down last year”** – “were down” is fine, but “were down” vs. “were low” is stylistic; not a grammar error.
5. **“My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic”** – “on the same line of logic” is unidiomatic; “along the same lines of logic” or “in line with the same logic.”
6. **“it seems their monopolies are still functional”** – “monopolies” is plural, but “their monopoly” (singular) is more idiomatic for each company.
7. **“they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies”** – “from the monopolies” is awkward; “from their monopolistic positions” or “from their monopolies.”
8. **“I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half”** – “no ounce of doubt” is colloquial; “I had no doubt” is standard.
9. **“McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready”** – “McKinsey Pichai” is a misnomer; “McKinsey” is a firm, not a title; “Pichai” is the person; “McKinsey-style Pichai” or “Pichai, in a McKinsey-like manner.”
10. **“In America We Trust”** – capitalization is inconsistent; “In America, we trust” or “In America, we trust them” (if referring to regulators).
11. **“they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose”** – “not kill” should be “not to kill” or “to not kill”; “to not kill” is more common in American English.
12. **“as a whole) to recoup their capital investments”** – “as a whole” is misplaced; “as a whole” should modify “investors,” not “companies”; “investors, as a whole, to recoup.”
13. **“I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years”** – “what GOOG will be like” is vague; “what GOOG will look like” or “how GOOG will perform.”
14. **“tech companies can fail REALLY fast”** – “REALLY” is informal; “really” is fine, but “can fail very quickly” is more formal.
15. **“With interest rates still held "high""** – “held high” is idiomatic; “held at high levels” is clearer.
16. **“the free money is draining away”** – “free money” is colloquial; “low-cost capital” is more precise.
17. **“besides small pockets of AI”** – “besides” should be “except for” or “apart from”; “besides” implies addition, not exclusion.
18. **“the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial 'efficiency'"** – “taking over” is fine, but “is taking over” vs. “is taking over” is consistent.
19. **“This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation”** – “wage cuts/stagnation” is awkward; “wage cuts or stagnation” or “wage cuts and stagnation.”
20. **“until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium”** – “supply/demand” is informal; “supply and demand” is standard.
21. **“Those who read history knows”** – “knows” should be “know”; “those who read history know.”
22. **“every industry goes through this phrase”** – “phrase” should be “phase”; “goes through this phase.”
23. **“Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance”** – capitalization of “True Abundance” is inconsistent; “true abundance” is fine.
24. **“People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like”** – “expectation what” should be “expectation of what” or “expectation that”; “have a reasonable expectation of what their careers would look like.”
25. **“generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing”** – “monotonic-increasing” is jargon; “consistently increasing” is clearer.
26. **“I always knew we're in a state of flux”** – “we’re” should be “we were” if referring to the past; “I always knew we were in a state of flux.”
27. **“Saving up for 'FI' isn't an aspiration”** – “FI” is unexplained; “financial independence” should be spelled out first.
28. **“especially as I'm geographically misplaced”** – “geographically misplaced” is vague; “geographically isolated” or “in a location with no tech jobs.”
29. **“there's actually no tech jobs here”** – “no tech jobs” should be “no tech jobs” (plural) or “no tech job” (singular); “no tech jobs” is fine.
30. **“my technical expertise is... in some funny stack”** – “is... in” is awkward; “lies in some funny stack” or “is in some funny stack.”

### Serious stylistic issues

1. **Overuse of parenthetical
