1. The main thesis of the text is that suffering and evil in the world are subjective experiences chosen by individuals, and that God, as the creator of everything, nurtures all creations without the need for human-like emotions. The text suggests that our subjective experiences are shaped by our choices and beliefs, and that we have the agency to change our experiences.

2. I partially agree. While the idea of subjective experiences and personal choice is intriguing, it oversimplifies the complex realities of suffering and evil, which often involve systemic issues and external factors beyond individual control.

```
In God's vast creation, all things take form,
From stars to souls, in endless swarm.
We choose our path, our qualia's hue,
Yet suffering's weight, some still construe.

Not all is love, nor all is pain,
In this grand design, we play our strain.
Move in space, or shift in time,
Your choice, your world, your climb.

For God's embrace, it holds us tight,
Through dark or dawn, we claim our light.
In every choice, a seed is sown,
In every life, a story's grown.
