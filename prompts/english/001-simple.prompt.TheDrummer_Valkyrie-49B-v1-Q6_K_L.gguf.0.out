1. The first whole number in English that contains the letter "A" is "Eight". So you would have to count up to 8 before using the letter "A".

2. The famous sentence is: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." It is famous because it is a pangram, meaning it contains every letter of the alphabet at least once.

3. Once upon a time, in a forest far, far away, the three little pigs were out for a stroll when they heard a rustling in the bushes. Out came Little Red Riding Hood, her red cloak fluttering behind her. 

"Hello there!" she greeted the pigs cheerfully. "What brings you out today?"

The first little pig, who lived in a house made of straw, explained that they were on a mission to find the perfect spot for a new community center. Little Red Riding Hood offered to help, and together they set off.

As they walked, they came across the second little pig's house made of sticks. "This could work!" exclaimed Little Red Riding Hood. "But we'll need to make it sturdier." The second pig agreed, and they began gathering materials.

Just then, a loud growl echoed through the forest. It was the Big Bad Wolf! He had been following Little Red Riding Hood, hoping to catch her off guard. But the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood were not afraid. Using their combined skills, they chased the wolf away and finished building the community center.

From that day on, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood were the best of friends. They held parties and gatherings in their new community center, and the forest was filled with laughter and joy. And they all lived happily ever after. [end of text]
