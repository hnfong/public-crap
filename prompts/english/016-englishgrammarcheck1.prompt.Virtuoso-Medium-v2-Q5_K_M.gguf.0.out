Grammar Mistakes:
1. "So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..." - "there's" should be "there is" for grammatical correctness.
2. "And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers" - "to an unwarranted assault" should be "an unwarranted assault."
3. "while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth" - "don't seem to be capable" should be "aren't capable."
4. "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations" - "had no ounce of doubt" should be "had no doubt."
5. "In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude" - "how I participated" should be "participating."

Serious Stylistic Issues:
1. "In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices" - The sentence is too long and could be split into two for clarity.
2. "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic" - The phrase "exactly on the same line of logic" is redundant and could be simplified.
3. "That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit" - The sentence is run-on and could be split into two for clarity.
4. "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard" - The sentence is confusing and could be restructured for clarity.
5. "The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose" - The sentence is run-on and could be split into two for clarity.

Other Problems:
1. "Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence" - The statement is vague and lacks attribution or context.
2. "META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG)" - The repetition of "GOOG" is unnecessary and could be simplified.
3. "McKinsey Pichai" - The name is incorrect; it should be "Sundar Pichai."
4. "In America We Trust" - The phrase is capitalized incorrectly and should be "In America, we trust."
5. "Saving up for 'FI' isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry" - The acronym "FI" is not defined and could be confusing for readers. [end of text]
