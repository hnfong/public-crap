## The Best Rainbows

My favourite rainbows aren't the big, bright ones after a proper storm. Those are lovely, of course, stretching right across the sky like a colourful bridge. But the *best* rainbows are the sneaky ones.

You know, the ones that pop up when the sun peeks out *during* a shower? The rain's still falling in patches, maybe just over Farmer Giles' field, and suddenly – *whoosh*! A little arc of colour appears. 

It's usually quite pale, almost shy. The red is a soft strawberry, the orange like a tangerine, and the violet is a gentle lavender. Sometimes you can only see half of it, tucked behind a cloud. 

They feel special, these little rainbows. Like a secret the sun and rain are sharing, just for you. They make me smile, even if I'm wearing my wellies and splashing in puddles. They remind me that even when things are a bit grey, a little bit of magic can always appear.
