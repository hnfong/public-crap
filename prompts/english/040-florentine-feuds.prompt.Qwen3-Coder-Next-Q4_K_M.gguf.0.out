The most strategically prudent course of action for Marco is to **disclose the commission’s requirement to use Medici-controlled lapis lazuli to the Albizzi *before* accepting the commission—and, if necessary, propose a transparent, mutually acceptable solution**—such as requesting the Albizzi themselves secure the material (or their permission to negotiate discreetly with the Medici under their auspices), or offering a credible alternative *only if* the Albizzi consent.

Here’s why, grounded in the norms of 15th-century Florentine society:

### 1. **Reputazione (Reputation) is Paramount**
In Renaissance Florence, *reputazione*—one’s public standing, honor, and reliability—was the foundation of professional survival. A reputation for integrity, loyalty, and discretion could open doors for decades; a single perceived betrayal—even if misunderstood—could exile one from patronage networks.  
- If Marco secretly negotiates with the Medici *without* the Albizzi’s knowledge and is discovered (and given the political volatility of the time, discovery is highly likely), he risks being branded *falso* (false/deceitful) and *traditore* (traitor) in the eyes of the Albizzi and their allies.  
- In contrast, *transparency*—even when difficult—demonstrates *virtù*: the capacity to act with prudence, foresight, and moral strength. A prudent artisan who anticipates conflict and resolves it honorably gains *reputazione* as a wise and trustworthy *maestro*.

### 2. **Clientela Relies on Reciprocal Obligation, Not Blind Obedience**
The *clientela* system was built on mutual obligation: patrons provided protection and opportunity; clients offered loyal, skillful service—including *honest counsel*.  
- A true *cliente* did not merely obey; he advised wisely. By concealing the Medici dependency, Marco would violate the *spirit* of the contract: the Albizzi expect a masterpiece, but also expect their agent to navigate obstacles *without* compromising their interests.  
- If Marco reveals the issue upfront, he positions himself as a problem-solver—not a passive instrument. He may even earn respect for his political acumen.

### 3. **The Medici–Albizzi Rivalry Makes Secrecy Extremely Risky**
The Albizzi and Medici were bitter rivals (the Albizzi had exiled Cosimo de’ Medici in 1433; though Cosimo returned in 1434, tensions remained high). In such an environment:  
- **Espionage was common**, and informants were everywhere—especially among guild members, suppliers, and rival workshops. A secret negotiation would likely be reported.  
- **The Albizzi’s punishment for disloyalty could be catastrophic**: loss of commissions, exile, fines, or even imprisonment (as seen in the fate of Cosimo’s allies).  
- By contrast, if the Albizzi *know* Marco is using Medici lapis, they retain control: they can demand assurances (e.g., no Medici branding on the reliquary), or even use the commission to subtly assert dominance over the Medici by “commanding” their resource.

### 4. **Prudent Alternatives Align with *Virtù***
Marco’s *virtù* lies in creative problem-solving within the constraints of power:  
- **Option A (Recommended)**: Present the issue to the Albizzi: *“Signori, the commission requires lapis from the Medici-controlled mine in Badakhshan. To honor your wishes without compromising your authority, I propose you either (1) authorize me to negotiate discreetly under your name, or (2) secure the stone yourselves—and I will craft the reliquary flawlessly regardless.”*  
- **Option B (If lapis is truly irreplaceable)**: Propose a *visible* Medici connection *under Albizzi oversight*—e.g., inscribe the Albizzi arms prominently, and note the stone’s origin as “a gift from the Serene House of Medici, by permission of the Albizzi.” This turns a potential liability into a display of Marco’s diplomatic *virtù*.  
- **Option C (Last resort)**: If the Albizzi refuse Medici involvement, Marco must decline the commission—better to lose one commission than risk his entire career.

### Historical Precedent
Florentine artisans like Lorenzo Ghiberti or Luca della Robbia navigated similar political minefields by cultivating relationships with *multiple* patrons and emphasizing loyalty to the *commune* and *guild* over individual families. Their longevity stemmed not from secrecy, but from *calculated transparency* and adaptability.

### Conclusion
Marco’s prudent path is to **act with openness and strategic foresight**, leveraging the Florentine ideal of *virtù* to transform a potential crisis into a demonstration of his value as a master artisan. By doing so, he protects his *reputazione*, honors the spirit of *clientela*, and aligns with the civic values that underpinned Florentine success. In a world where patronage could vanish overnight, the greatest *virtù* is knowing when—and how—to speak the truth. [end of text]
