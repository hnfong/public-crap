Once upon a time, in a small village in the UK, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved rainbows more than anything. One day, after a big rain, Lily saw a rainbow that was extra special. It wasn't just one rainbow, but two! One was bright red, and the other was deep purple. They were so close together, like they were holding hands. Lily ran to the rainbow and hugged them, feeling so happy and lucky. She knew those rainbows would always make her smile. [end of text]
