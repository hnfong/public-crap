Okay, let's break down this scenario:

1.  **What happened?**
    *   Alice asked Bob if he was eating healthy.
    *   Bob enthusiastically confirmed he was and described a very specific, seemingly complex meal involving aged organic milk, seasoned tomato purée, and baked whole wheat.
    *   Alice was intrigued and asked to see.
    *   Bob sent a photo of the actual food.
    *   Alice's reaction of "wtf" indicates the photo showed something completely unexpected, bizarre, or disgusting, despite Bob's healthy-sounding description.

2.  **What did Bob eat?**
    *   The description is highly unusual and likely metaphorical or describing something processed/unappetizing.
    *   "Aged organic milk tossed over..." suggests the milk wasn't liquid but perhaps solidified, like cheese (e.g., Parmesan shavings or crumbles) or maybe even processed into a solid form.
    *   "...seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat" could mean the tomato purée was spread on something like a whole wheat cracker or bread, but the combination with the "tossed" milk is odd.
    *   Given Alice's reaction, Bob likely ate something that sounds healthy when described with those specific, wholesome words but looks terrible or is an unusual processed food item. A plausible guess is a very strange, possibly processed snack bar or cracker combination, or maybe even something like a cheesy, tomato-flavored cracker where the description sounds much more complex and gourmet than the reality. The key is the disconnect between the sophisticated description and the actual appearance.

3.  **Was it healthy?**
    *   Based *only* on Bob's description ("aged organic milk," "whole wheat"), it *sounds* healthy.
    *   However, given Alice's "wtf" reaction, it's highly unlikely the *actual* item was genuinely healthy. The photo likely revealed something processed, high in sodium, sugar, or fat, or simply looked unappetizing and therefore probably not nutritious. The description was likely either misleading or describing a food item that doesn't live up to its wholesome-sounding name. [end of text]
