### 1. Main Thesis of the Text (in 3 sentences):  
The text argues that suffering exists because we, as vessels of subjective experience, choose (consciously or unconsciously) to perceive and engage with it as part of God’s creation of *all* possibilities. God’s "love" is not emotional but a universal nurturing of all existence, and our agency lies in how we frame our experiences—even suffering is a chosen perspective. Evil and suffering are not inherent truths but subjective constructs we validate by believing in them.  

### 2. Do You Agree? (Concise Explanation):  
Partially. The idea that perception shapes experience is compelling (e.g., ignorance vs. awareness of suffering), but it risks dismissing systemic or involuntary suffering (e.g., children in war). Agency isn’t always accessible—some "choices" are illusions under coercion or trauma. The text’s focus on subjectivity overlooks shared, objective realities of pain.  

### 3. Poem (Rhyming):  

**"The Choice of Sight"**  

God spun the world with endless thread,  
A loom of light and shadows spread.  
We pick the hues—the bright, the grim,  
To weave our joy or sorrow’s hymn.  

You say the pain is not your hand?  
Yet cling to tales of wars unmanned.  
The tribes untouched by distant woe  
Choose not to see the storms below.  

What’s real is what you dare to name,  
A doll-tiger or raging flame.  
Step left or right, but don’t decry—  
You chose the lens you call the sky. [end of text]
