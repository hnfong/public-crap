3. Here is a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood:

Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who lived in a small house by the forest. They each built a house with different materials: the first pig built a house out of straw, the second pig built a house out of wood, and the third pig built a house out of brick. The mother pig warned them to be careful of the big bad wolf who lived in the nearby forest.

One day, the big bad wolf came knocking on their door and asked to stay the night. The first pig and the second pig were careless and let the wolf in, but the third pig was smart and refused to let the wolf in. The wolf tried to blow down the straw house, but it was too weak, and the wolf then tried to blow down the wood house, but it was also too weak. Finally, the wolf tried to blow down the brick house, but it was too strong and the wolf had to give up.

That night, the big bad wolf went to the house of the little red riding hood, who was walking by. The wolf disguised himself as a kind old man and asked her to go to his house for some food. The little red riding hood agreed, but her mother warned her not to go. However, she ignored her mother's warning and went with the wolf.

The wolf took the little red riding hood to his house and locked her in the basement. Just as the wolf was about to eat her, the three little pigs heard the noise and came to her rescue. They used the materials from their houses to build a big fire, which scared the wolf away. The little red riding hood was saved, and the three little pigs lived happily ever after. [end of text]
