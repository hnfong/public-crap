The best rainbows I know appear after a summer shower in the garden. The sky is still grey, but the sun peeks out from behind the clouds. Suddenly, a bright arc of colour stretches across the sky.

I love the one that looks like a giant, shiny bridge. It starts near the old oak tree and ends by the red shed. The colours are so clear: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. They seem to dance in the air.

Sometimes, I see two rainbows together. The second one is fainter, like a ghost, with the colours in the wrong order. It feels magical.

My favourite moment is when the rain stops and the air smells fresh. The rainbow stays for just a few minutes before fading away. It reminds me that even after a storm, something beautiful can appear. I always wish I could climb up to the top and see what is on the other side. Perhaps there is a pot of gold, or maybe just a friendly cloud waiting to play. Until then, I will keep watching the sky for my next rainbow. [end of text]
