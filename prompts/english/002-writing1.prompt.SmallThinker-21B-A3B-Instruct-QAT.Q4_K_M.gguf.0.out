**The Cloud and the Pillow**  

In a quiet village nestled between rolling hills, there lived a girl named Lila who adored the sky. Every evening, she’d lie on her rooftop, staring at the clouds, imagining they were dragons, castles, or even her lost grandmother’s laughter. Her grandmother, Mira, would smile and say, “Love is like a cloud, Lila—it’s light, it’s fleeting, but it makes the world feel alive.”  

One day, Lila’s friend, a boy named Eli, teased her. “You’re *exaggerating* again,” he said, pointing at her cloud-gazing. “That’s just a cloud. It’s not a dragon.” Lila frowned. “But it *could* be! And if I believe it, maybe it will be.”  

Eli rolled his eyes but joined her anyway. They spent hours naming clouds—“The Dragon of the Dusk,” “The Castle of the Moon.” But one night, a storm rolled in, and the clouds turned gray. Lila’s heart sank. “It’s gone,” she whispered.  

Mira found her later, sitting alone. “Love isn’t just in the clouds,” she said gently. “It’s in the *connection* you make when you share them. When you laugh, when you believe, even when the sky is dark.”  

The next day, Lila and Eli sat on the rooftop again. This time, they didn’t just name clouds—they talked about their dreams, their fears, and the way the world felt brighter when they were together. The clouds, though still gray, seemed softer, as if the sky itself had softened.  

And Lila learned that love wasn’t about exaggerating the world—it was about making it feel *real*.  

**The End.**
