In the quiet village of Elara, there lived an old clockmaker named Elias who had forgotten how to feel. His days were measured in ticks and tocks, precise and cold, until the day a strange storm rolled in. It wasn't a normal storm; the sky turned a bruised purple, and the rain fell upwards, defying gravity.

Elias sat by his window, watching a single, fluffy **cloud** drift unusually low, hovering just above the rooftops like a lost sheep. It seemed to be crying, shedding tiny droplets that sparkled like diamonds before vanishing into the air.

"You're **exaggerating** the drama," Elias muttered to the cloud, adjusting his spectacles. "It's just weather. There is no need for such a display."

But the cloud didn't move. Instead, it drifted closer, pressing against the glass until it slipped through the crack in the window frame. It didn't wet the floor; instead, it settled softly onto Elias's workbench, transforming into a small, shivering boy made entirely of mist and light.

"I'm cold," the boy whispered, his voice sounding like wind through leaves. "No one has held me in centuries."

Elias frowned. He was a man of gears and springs, not emotions. "I cannot fix you," he said stiffly. "I only repair broken things."

"I am not broken," the boy replied sadly. "I am just unloved."

Something in Elias's chest tightened, a feeling he hadn't experienced since his wife passed years ago. He looked around his cluttered shop and spotted a soft, down-filled **pillow** he used to rest his head during long nights of work. Without thinking, he grabbed it and gently placed it beneath the misty boy.

"Here," Elias said, his voice softer than he intended. "Rest here."

The boy looked up, his eyes widening. "Is this for me?"

"Yes," Elias nodded. Then, hesitantly, he reached out and wrapped his arms around the cool mist. As he held the boy, a warmth spread through Elias's fingers, traveling up his arms and melting the ice around his heart. The boy glowed brighter, turning from a pale gray to a radiant gold.

"You see," the boy smiled, "you didn't need to fix anything. You just needed to love."

As the boy dissolved back into the air, rising to rejoin the sky, the storm outside ceased instantly. The sun broke through, casting a golden light over the village. Elias stood by his window, realizing that while gears could keep time, only love could make the moments matter. He learned that day that love isn't about grand gestures or fixing what is broken; sometimes, it is simply offering a soft place to rest when the world feels too heavy. [end of text]
