In the quiet village of Elara, there lived an old clockmaker named Elias who believed that time was the only thing that mattered. He spent his days fixing gears and his nights worrying about every second lost. One evening, a young girl named Mia knocked on his door, her eyes red from crying.

"My heart feels too heavy," she whispered. "It's like I'm carrying a storm inside me."

Elias sighed, adjusting his spectacles. "You are **exaggerating**, child. Hearts are just muscles; they pump blood, not storms. Go home and rest."

But Mia didn't leave. She sat on his worn wooden stool and pulled a small, tattered **pillow** from her bag. "My grandmother gave me this," she said softly. "She told me that when the world feels hard, I should hold something soft until I remember how to be gentle again."

Elias watched as she hugged the pillow, her breathing slowing down. Suddenly, he noticed the way the evening light hit the dust motes dancing in the air. They looked like a fluffy white **cloud** trapped inside his dusty shop. For the first time in years, he stopped looking at his clocks. He realized that while time measured the length of a life, it was love that gave it weight and warmth.

"You aren't exaggerating," Elias admitted, his voice trembling slightly. He reached out and gently patted the pillow beside her hand. "The storm is real. But so is the shelter."

In that moment, the old clockmaker learned that fixing broken things wasn't just about gears and springs; sometimes, it was about offering a soft place to land. Love, he discovered, was the only force strong enough to turn a heavy storm into a passing cloud. [end of text]
