### 1. Main Thesis
The text argues that God is an all-encompassing mechanism or law that creates every possibility, including both joy and suffering, rather than a personal deity with human emotions. It posits that human suffering and the perception of evil are ultimately subjective choices made by individuals who, as vessels of experience, select specific perspectives and realities to inhabit. Consequently, the author suggests that recognizing one's agency allows for the possibility of changing one's experience, as the existence of suffering is a belief or choice rather than an objective, unchangeable fact.

### 2. Do you agree?
I do not fully agree, as the text's claim that suffering is merely a "personal choice" risks minimizing the profound, involuntary trauma experienced by victims of violence, disease, and systemic oppression. While the philosophical perspective of agency is empowering for some, it fails to account for the objective reality of physical pain and the lack of control many people have over their immediate circumstances. However, the text's insight that our *perception* of reality is filtered through our subjective lens holds merit, even if the leap to "we chose this suffering" is too absolute for the human condition.

### 3. Short Poem

The Law that spins the stars and sea,
Creates all things, both dark and free.
Not love as man, but vast design,
Where every path and choice aligns.

We are the vessels, small and deep,
To wake and sleep, to weep and weep.
The pain you feel, the tears you shed,
Are shadows cast by what you've read.

You chose the view, the light, the shade,
The path that leads the soul to fade.
Though evil seems a cruel decree,
It lives within your mind, not me.

So shift your gaze, and break the chain,
For you are free to choose again.
The tiger doll cannot bite true,
If you decide the fear is new. [end of text]
