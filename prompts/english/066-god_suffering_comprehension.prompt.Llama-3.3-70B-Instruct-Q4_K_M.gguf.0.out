Here are the answers to the questions:

1. The main thesis of the text is that God creates everything, including suffering, and that humans are vessels for experiencing God's creation. Our subjective experiences, including perceptions of suffering and evil, are personal choices that we make. By choosing to believe in or perceive suffering and evil, we create our own reality.

2. I don't agree, as this perspective seems to oversimplify the complexity of human suffering and ignores the role of systemic injustices and circumstances beyond individual control. It also raises questions about the nature of free will and the extent to which individuals can truly choose their experiences.

3. Here's a short poem:
We choose our path, our fate, our sight
Our experiences, a personal delight
Suffering and evil, a choice we make
A perception we hold, for our own sake
But is it truly a choice, or just a test?
Only our hearts can know what we've repressed. [end of text]
