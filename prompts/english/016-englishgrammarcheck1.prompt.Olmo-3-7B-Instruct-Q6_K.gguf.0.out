**Grammar Issues (Tense & Agreement)**

1. **Tense Inconsistency – Present vs. Past**
   - "While this might seem to an unwarranted assault..." (should be "to" not "an" — agreement error, but also tense is present, which is fine here, but see next)
   - "Back when tech stocks were down last year" (past tense — correct)
   - "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something" (present tense — acceptable, but "he was" would be past if context required)
   - "If only because I would have hated..." (conditional perfect — "would have" is correct for hypothetical past)
   - "The free money is draining away" (present continuous — acceptable, but "was draining away" would be past tense if referring to a specific time)
   - "Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance" (present tense — correct for declarative statement)
   - "These jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig..." (present continuous — acceptable for ongoing observation)
   - "The ruthless capitalist engine is taking over" (present continuous — acceptable, but could use past if referring to an ongoing process in the past)

2. **Agreement Errors**
   - "in particular META and GOOG. My analysis ... was exactly on the same line of logic" (missing "the" before META and GOOG — minor, but could be considered for completeness)
   - "they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations" — "by almost half" is fine, but "without really affecting" could be clearer, but no agreement error.
   - "McKinsey Pichai" — should be "McKinsey & Company's CEO Sundar Pichai" or just "Pichai" for clarity, but not an agreement error.
   - "There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough..." — "whether" is correct here (not "if"), but no agreement issue.
   - "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough..." — "they're" is correct (they are), but the phrase "In America We Trust" is awkward and not standard grammar, but not an agreement error.

3. **Subject-Verb Agreement**
   - "These who read history knows" — should be "Those who read history know" (subject-verb agreement for plural "these" or "those").
   - "but In America We Trust they're..." — "they're" is correct (they are), but the preceding phrase is ungrammatical.
   - "my technical expertise is... in some funny stack..." — "is" agrees with "expertise," which is correct.

**Serious Stylistic Issues**

1. **Overuse of Colloquialisms and Informal Language**
   - Heavy reliance on slang, contractions, and informal phrasing ("I'm sure," "we're still sane," "it's a fun ride," "as a whole") makes the text feel less professional and more like a personal blog or social media post rather than a serious analysis.
   - Phrases like "the party's gonna end" and "predatory capitalist attitude" are too casual for most written discourse.

2. **Ambiguous or Vague References**
   - "especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here)" — the parenthetical is abrupt and could be more smoothly integrated.
   - "in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses" — "stack" is ambiguous without context for readers not familiar with the term in this context.
   - "True Abundance" is a loaded term without definition in the text, making the statement feel more opinionated than analytical.

3. ** run-on Sentences and Lack of Cohesion**
   - Several long, complex sentences that are difficult to follow, often with multiple clauses strung together without proper punctuation or transitions.
   - Example: "In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid."
   - The use of em dashes and parentheses without clear structure can confuse the reader.

4. **Inconsistent Tone and Perspective**
   - The tone shifts between analytical, cynical, and almost conversational, making it hard to determine the author's main argument or intent.
   - The narrative moves from personal agreement with a critique of tech workers, to financial speculation, to philosophical musings on abundance and industry cycles — without clear transitions.

5. **Unsubstantiated or Vague Claims**
   - "predatory capitalist attitude" — no concrete examples or evidence provided.
   - "abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance" — philosophical assertion without development or citation.
   - "every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another" — unclear, and "phrase" is not the right word; likely meant "cycle" or "phase".

6. **Repetition and Redundancy**
   - The phrase "the logic is solid" is repeated.
   - "with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone" and "small pockets of AI" could be more concisely expressed.
   - "True Abundance" and "True Enrichment" (if implied) are used as buzzwords without explanation.

**Other Problems**

1. **Awkward Phrasing and Unnatural Expressions**
   - "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough..." — the phrase "In America We Trust" is not idiomatic or standard English.
   - "There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough..." — "whether" is correct, but the structure is awkward.
   - "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like..." — missing "that"
