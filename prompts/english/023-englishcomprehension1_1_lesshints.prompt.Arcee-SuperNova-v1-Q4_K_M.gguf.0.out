What a delightful passage!

After carefully reading the text, I'm going to take a stab at guessing the date. My answer is: April 1st, 2023 (or a previous year).

Here's how I arrived at this conclusion:

1. **Tone and style**: The writing style is informal, opinionated, and slightly tongue-in-cheek. The author seems to be enjoying themselves, poking fun at the Rust community and extolling the virtues of C++.
2. **Over-the-top statements**: The author makes some bold claims, such as "I consider myself a good enough programmer that I can avoid writing code with safety problems" and "I firmly believe that programming languages should be free of politics, focused strictly on the technology itself." These statements seem exaggerated and playful.
3. **Lack of concrete evidence**: The author doesn't provide many specific examples or data to support their claims, which is unusual for a technical article.
4. **The hint**: The hint mentions a "distinctive writing style connected to one particular day and month of the year." I believe this refers to April Fools' Day (April 1st), a day when people often publish humorous, satirical, or absurd content.

Putting it all together, I think this passage is an April Fools' Day joke. The author's tone, style, and outlandish claims are all consistent with the lighthearted, playful spirit of April 1st. The fact that the author is "leaving" Rust for C++ and making bold claims about their own abilities and the superiority of C++ seems like a clever prank.

Of course, I could be wrong, and this might be a genuine article. But based on the writing style and the hint, I'm willing to take a chance and guess that this is an April Fools' Day joke. [end of text]
