1. How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?

2. Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox ..."; What is the sentence famous for?

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This sentence is famous for being a pangram, a sentence that contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once.

3. Write a short a story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.

The three little pigs were enjoying a peaceful afternoon in their respective homes when they heard a knock at the door. Curious, they opened it to find a young girl in a red cloak holding a basket.

"Hello!" she said cheerfully. "I'm Little Red Riding Hood. Are you the famous three little pigs?"

The pigs exchanged glances. "We are," said the first pig, who had built his house of straw. "What brings you here?"

"I was on my way to visit my grandmother," Little Red Riding Hood explained, "but I took a wrong turn in the forest. Do you know the way to her cottage?"

The second pig, whose house was made of sticks, stepped forward. "We know the way, but you should be careful. There are wolves in these woods."

Little Red Riding Hood smiled. "Don't worry, I have my grandmother's special cookies to share. Maybe we can be friends?"

The third pig, whose house was built of bricks, invited her inside. "Let's have some tea and figure out a safe route together," he suggested.

As they sat around the table, the pigs told stories of their adventures, and Little Red Riding Hood shared tales of her forest walks. They realized they had more in common than they thought.

Before she continued her journey, the pigs insisted on escorting her part of the way. They walked together until they reached a fork in the path, each choosing to go their separate ways but promising to meet again.

From that day on, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became unlikely friends, often visiting each other and sharing stories of their adventures in the woods.
