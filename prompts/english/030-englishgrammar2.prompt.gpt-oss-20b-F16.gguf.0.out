<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to review each sentence and suggest modifications. The sentences are:

1. 你咁趕做咩啫，你慌人哋唔等你咩？ Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait? We need to produce a suggested sentence. The original English translation is "Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?" That is not perfect. We can propose: "Why are you in such a hurry? Are you worried that they won't wait for you?" Or "Why are you rushing? Are you worried they won't wait for you?" The original "Why are you hurry?" is wrong grammar. So we propose: "Why are you in such a hurry? Are you worried that they won't wait for you?" That is simple, fluent.

2. 佢份人夠大量，唔同班𡃁仔計較。 He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids. The translation is weird. The Cantonese: "佢份人夠大量，唔同班𡃁仔計較." Means "He is a generous person, he doesn't argue with kids from other classes about trivial matters." But "夠大量" maybe "夠大" meaning "big" or "generous"? Actually "夠大量" might be "quite a lot" or "big person"? "唔同班𡃁仔計較" means "doesn't argue with kids from other classes about trivial matters." So translation: "He is a generous person and doesn't argue with kids from other classes over trivial matters." So we propose: "He is a generous person and doesn't argue with kids from other classes over trivial matters." That is simple.

3. 學語文冇捷徑，要靠大量浸淫。 There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it. The translation is okay but maybe "learning a language has no shortcut; it requires extensive immersion." So propose: "There is no shortcut to learning a language; it requires extensive immersion." That is simple.

4. 小新喺同事面前讚美女朋友有幾溫柔。 Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender. The translation: "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender." That is okay but maybe "Siu-san praised his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for being very gentle." So propose: "Siu-san praised his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for being very gentle." That is simple.

5. 我日日都搭地鐵返學。 I take the metro to school every day. That is fine. So we output the original sentence.

Thus final output: Provide one suggested English translation per sentence. For sentence 5, output original sentence. Let's produce final answer.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>1. Suggested sentence: Why are you in such a hurry? Are you worried that they won’t wait for you?
