In the quiet village of Elmsworth, nestled between rolling hills and a whispering forest, lived a young girl named Mira. She was clever and curious, with eyes that sparkled like morning dew. But Mira had a habit—she loved to tell stories, and sometimes, just sometimes, she was *exaggerating*.

“If I jump from the hayloft,” she once told her friends, “I can almost touch the cloud with my toes!”

The children giggled, knowing full well that Mira’s jumps never left the ground, but they loved her tales all the same.

One winter, a bitter cold settled over the village. Snow piled high, and the wind howled through the chimneys. Old Mr. Hemlock, who lived alone at the edge of the woods, fell ill. His fire had gone out, and no one could reach him—the path was buried under snowdrifts taller than houses.

Mira heard the news and tugged at her mother’s sleeve. “I can help him! I’ll bring him my warmest blanket!”

Her mother hesitated. “It’s too dangerous, Mira. The storm—”

But Mira was already wrapping herself in layers, clutching a thick woolen blanket. “Love is stronger than snow,” she said, her breath puffing like a tiny cloud.

She trudged through the storm, her boots sinking with every step. When she finally reached Mr. Hemlock’s cottage, she found him shivering beneath a thin quilt, his face pale as the moon.

“I brought you warmth,” Mira said, spreading the blanket over him.

Mr. Hemlock smiled weakly. “You’re a brave girl. But you’ll catch your death out there.”

Mira shrugged. “I’ve got my pillow, too,” she said, pulling a small, lumpy pillow from her satchel. “It’s not much, but it smells like home. Maybe it’ll help you sleep.”

The old man’s eyes softened. “You know, Mira, people say you exaggerate. But I think you just see the world bigger than most. And maybe… that’s a kind of love.”

That night, Mira stayed, feeding the stove with kindling and humming songs her grandmother taught her. She didn’t fly to the clouds or leap over mountains—she just sat, held his hand, and made sure he wasn’t alone.

By morning, the storm had passed. The villagers arrived with medicine and food, amazed that Mira had made it through.

“You’re a hero!” someone said.

Mira blushed. “I didn’t do anything special. I just brought a blanket and a pillow.”

“But you brought love,” Mr. Hemlock said from his bed, his voice stronger now. “And that’s warmer than any fire.”

From then on, when Mira told her stories, no one called them exaggerations. They called them *heart-truths*—tales shaped not by lies, but by love.

And sometimes, on clear nights, the villagers would point to a soft, glowing cloud in the sky and whisper, “That’s Mira’s pillow, floating home—filled with kindness, and stitched with love.” [end of text]
