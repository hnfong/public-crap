<s> USER: Write a story using less than 10 words. The story should be about loss in life and/or grieving.

ASSISTANT:  Sun sets, shadows lengthen; she whispers to the empty chair beside her.

Alternatively, for a more structured micro-story:

Bereft, she clutched the locket, its cold metal a stark contrast to the warmth of memories now fading.

Or, for a poignant single-sentence narrative:

The last leaf fell, and with it, the final echo of his laughter vanished into the wind.

Each of these micro-stories aims to evoke the profound sense of loss and the act of grieving within the constraints of very few words.</s>
