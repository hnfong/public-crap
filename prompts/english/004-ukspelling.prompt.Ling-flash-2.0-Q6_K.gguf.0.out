After the rain on a warm summer’s eve, when the air smells like wet grass and daisies, I look for the **special** rainbow.  
It’s not the one high in the sky, wide and pale. No.  

I wait until the sun dips low, just behind the hills near Misty Lane. Then, when the last drops fall quiet, I run to the old willow tree by the brook.  

And there it is.  
A tiny, perfect rainbow, no bigger than a hoop. It curves like a smile, just over the water, painted in bright, bold stripes: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet — all crisp and close.  

It doesn’t last long. Maybe five breaths. But in that time, I see it clearly. It feels like a secret only the brook and I share.  

I call it the **Willow’s Glow**.  
It appears just once a year, on the first evening after rain when the swallows swoop home.  

I stand very still. If I blink, it’s gone.  
But I remember.  
And that’s magic enough.
