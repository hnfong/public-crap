**The Pillow That Couldn’t Fly**

In the quiet town of Willowbrook, lived a boy named Leo who believed love was a silly thing — something you said to people you didn’t really care about. He thought love was like a pillow: soft, useless, and best left on the bed.

One day, Leo’s grandmother gave him a special pillow — not just any pillow, but one stitched with tiny stars and embroidered with the words, “Love holds you up, even when you’re falling.” Leo rolled his eyes. “That’s just exaggerating,” he muttered. “Love doesn’t do anything. It’s just… fluffy nonsense.”

But that night, as he lay in bed, the pillow seemed to glow. A soft light shimmered from its seams, and suddenly, Leo was floating — not in his room, but in a sky full of clouds. The clouds were smiling, and they whispered, “Love is the wind that lifts you. Love is the anchor that keeps you grounded. Love is the pillow that catches you when you fall.”

Leo laughed. “This is ridiculous,” he said. “You’re exaggerating again.”

But the clouds didn’t answer. They just floated around him, warm and gentle, until he realized — he was safe. He was loved. He didn’t need to be strong. He didn’t need to be perfect. He just needed to be.

When Leo woke up, the pillow was still there — soft, starry, and quiet. He hugged it tight. “Maybe,” he whispered, “love isn’t just a pillow. Maybe it’s the cloud that holds you when you’re afraid. Maybe it’s the hand that doesn’t let go.”

And from that day on, Leo stopped exaggerating. He started listening. He started loving — not just with words, but with actions, with presence, with quiet, steady care.

Because love, he learned, isn’t fluffy nonsense. It’s the pillow that catches you. The cloud that holds you. The quiet force that says, “I’m here.”

And sometimes, the most important things in life… are the ones you didn’t believe in until you fell — and someone caught you.
