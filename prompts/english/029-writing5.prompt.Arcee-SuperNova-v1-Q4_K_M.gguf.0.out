I sit in class, try to focus on teacher's lesson, but my mind always wander to forest. I am not like other student, I have secret. I am wood elf. My name is Elara, but my friend call me Elly.

I live in Hong Kong, but my heart belong to forest. I love tree, love bird, love river. When I am in forest, I feel free. I can run fast, climb high, and talk to animal. But in school, I must be careful. Human no understand about wood elf.

My best friend, Rachel, she think I am just weird. She say I always daydream, always look out window. But she no know, I am watching bird, watching tree sway in wind. I am connect to nature, even in city.

In class, I try to pay attention, but it hard. Teacher talk about math, science, history. I no care about these thing. I care about forest, about magic. I have magic, but I no use it in school. I promise my mother, I keep it secret.

At lunchtime, I sit with Rachel and other friend. They talk about boy, about party, about TV show. I listen, but I no understand. Why they care about these thing? Don't they know, there more important thing in life? Like tree, like river, like magic?

But I no say anything. I just smile, just laugh. I want to fit in, want to be normal. But sometimes, I feel like I am living two life. One life in school, one life in forest.

After school, I go to forest. I run, I climb, I talk to animal. I feel free, feel happy. I am myself, no need to hide. I am wood elf, and I proud of it.

But when I go back home, I must be careful. My mother say, "Elly, you must keep secret. Human no understand." I know, I know. I promise, I keep secret. But sometimes, I wish I can be myself, all the time. [end of text]
