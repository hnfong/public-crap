We are given a text and asked to identify grammar mistakes (especially tense and agreement), serious stylistic issues, or other problems. We are to ignore minor stylistic/sentence structure issues and report at least 5 issues in each category.

First, let's break down the categories:

1. **Grammar mistakes**: Focus on tense consistency, subject-verb agreement, pronoun-antecedent agreement, etc.
2. **Serious stylistic issues**: Issues that affect clarity, tone, or formality; wordiness; inappropriate language; etc.
3. **Other problems**: This could include factual inaccuracies, logical inconsistencies, or any other non-stylistic and non-grammar issues.

We are to output in list/point form and identify at least 5 issues per category.

Let's analyze the text:

### Grammar Mistakes

1. "So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..."
   - "there's" is a contraction for "there is", which is singular, but the subject that follows is plural ("people"). However, "there is" is often used colloquially with plural nouns, so this might be considered minor. But note: the instruction says to focus on agreement. We might let this pass as it's common in informal writing.

2. "And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault"
   - Missing article: It should be "to be an unwarranted assault". The word "to" is likely a typo for "to be". Alternatively, it could be "to seem like an unwarranted assault", but as written, it's incorrect.

3. "it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down."
   - Repetition: "the monopolies" is repeated. This is more stylistic, but we are to ignore minor stylistic issues. However, if we consider it as a clarity issue, it might be noted. But let's focus on grammar.

4. "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations."
   - Tense inconsistency: The main clause is in past tense ("I had"), but the subordinate clause uses present tense ("they can cut"). It should be consistent: "they could cut".

5. "McKinsey Pichai" 
   - This is a factual error: The CEO of Google is Sundar Pichai. "McKinsey" is a consulting firm. This is a serious mistake, but it's more factual than grammatical. We'll note it in "other problems".

6. "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough"
   - Punctuation issue: There should be a comma after "Trust" because "In America We Trust" is a phrase and the sentence continues. Also, it's a reference to the U.S. motto "In God We Trust", so it should be capitalized and set off. But without punctuation, it runs into the next clause.

7. "Those who read history knows"
   - Subject-verb agreement: "Those" is plural, so it should be "know", not "knows".

8. "every industry goes through this phrase"
   - Wrong word: It should be "phase", not "phrase".

9. "it has been a fun ride."
   - This is grammatically correct, but note the tense: present perfect. It fits.

10. "I always knew we're in a state of flux."
    - Tense inconsistency: "knew" is past, but "we're" (we are) is present. It should be "we were" to match the past tense.

11. "Saving up for 'FI' isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here)"
    - Agreement: "there's" (there is) is singular, but "no tech jobs" is plural. It should be "there are actually no tech jobs".

Now, let's list at least 5 grammar issues:

1. "to an unwarranted assault" → should be "to be an unwarranted assault" (or "like an unwarranted assault").
2. "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut" → tense: "can" should be "could" to match past tense "had".
3. "Those who read history knows" → subject-verb agreement: "knows" should be "know".
4. "every industry goes through this phrase" → word choice: "phrase" should be "phase".
5. "I always knew we're in a state of flux" → tense: "we're" should be "we were".
6. "there's actually no tech jobs" → agreement: "there's" should be "there are".

### Serious Stylistic Issues

1. The text uses a lot of informal language and slang, which may not be appropriate for a formal context. Examples: "So there's", "he's probably onto something", "squeeze quite a bit of profit", "without really affecting", "McKinsey Pichai" (if it's a joke, it's unclear and inappropriate), "In America We Trust" (sarcasm that might be confusing), "enshittification" (vulgar and informal), "fun ride", "party's gonna end", "we're still sane though".

2. The term "enshittification" is a slang term coined by Cory Doctorow, but it is highly informal and may be considered vulgar. It might not be suitable for all audiences.

3. The use of parentheses is excessive and disrupts the flow. For example: "(who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking)", "(GOOG mainly)", "(as a whole)", "(there's actually no tech jobs here)", "(we're still sane though, just unique circumstances)". This makes the text choppy.

4. The tone is inconsistent. It starts with a serious economic analysis and then becomes very personal and colloquial. For example, the shift from discussing monopolies and layoffs to personal savings and living frugally.

5. The phrase "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough" is a play on the national motto, but without proper punctuation and context, it can be confusing. It also comes across as sarcastic, which might not be intended in a serious piece.

6. The use of "McKinsey Pichai" is either a factual error or an attempt at humor (combining McKinsey, the consulting firm, with Sundar Pichai). If it's an error, it's serious. If it's humor, it's out of place and unclear.

7. The text uses contractions liberally (e.g., "it's", "they're", "we're"), which is acceptable in informal writing but may be too casual for a serious analysis.

8. The phrase "the party's gonna end" is very informal and colloquial.

Let's list at least 5:

1. Use of vulgar slang: "enshittification" is inappropriate in formal contexts.
2. Excessive parentheses: disrupts the flow and makes the text hard to follow.
3. Inconsistent tone: shifts from analytical to personal and colloquial without transition.
4. Inappropriate humor or error: "McKinsey Pichai" — either a factual mistake or misplaced humor.
5. Overuse of contractions and informal expressions (e.g., "gonna", "fun ride") that undermine the seriousness of the topic.

### Other Problems

1. Factual error: "McKinsey Pichai" — the CEO of Google is Sundar Pichai. McKinsey is a consulting firm. This is a significant error.

2. The statement "they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations" is a strong claim without evidence. It may be an overstatement.

3. The assertion that "antitrust slams down hard" is a generalization. Antitrust actions are complex and not always timely or effective.

4. The claim that "every industry goes through this phase" is a broad generalization that may not hold for all industries.

5. The personal anecdote about not investing due to ideological reasons and then admitting the logic is solid might be seen as contradictory or confusing.

6. The statement about AI being "operationally much smaller than general tech" is vague and may not be accurate. AI is a significant part of tech.

7. The phrase "geographically misplaced" is unclear. It might be better to say "located in an area without tech jobs".

8. The text implies that tech jobs are uniquely unstable compared to other industries, which may be an overgeneralization.

Let's list at least 5:

1. Factual error: "McKinsey Pichai" — incorrect name for the Google CEO.
2. Unsupported claim: Asserting that Google and Meta can cut costs by half without affecting operations lacks evidence.
3. Overgeneralization: "every industry goes through this phase" — not all industries have the same dynamics.
4. Contradiction: The author avoids investing due to ideological reasons but admits the logic is solid, which might confuse the reader about the author's stance.
5. Vague and potentially inaccurate statement: AI being "operationally much smaller than general tech" is not clearly defined and may be factually debatable.

Now, we compile the lists, ensuring at least 5 per category.

### Final List

**Grammar Mistakes:**
1. "to an unwarranted assault" should be "to be an unwarranted assault" (or "like an unwarranted assault").
2. "they can cut" should be "they could cut" to match the past tense of "I had".
3. "knows" should be "know" in "Those who read history knows".
4. "phrase" should be "phase" in "every industry goes through this phrase".
5. "we're" should be "we were" in "I always knew we're in a state of flux".
6. "there's" should be "there are" in "there's actually no tech jobs".

**Serious Stylistic Issues:**
1. The term "enshittification" is vulgar slang and inappropriate for formal writing.
2. Excessive use of parentheses disrupts the flow and readability.
3. Inconsistent tone: shifts from analytical to colloquial (e.g., "party's gonna end", "fun ride").
4. The phrase "McKinsey Pichai" is either a factual error or an attempt at humor that falls flat and confuses.
5. Overuse of contractions and informal expressions (e.g., "gonna", "it's", "we're") reduces the formality expected in such analysis.

**Other Problems:**
1. Factual error: "McKinsey Pichai" — the correct name is Sundar Pichai.
2. Unsupported claim: Asserting that cutting costs by half wouldn't affect operations requires evidence.
3. Overgeneralization: "every industry goes through this phase" is too broad and unsupported.
4. Contradiction: The author's ideological avoidance of investment conflicts with admitting the logic is solid, creating confusion.
5. Vague and potentially inaccurate statement: Describing AI as "operationally much smaller than general tech" is unclear and may be incorrect.

Note: We have provided more than 5 in grammar to ensure we meet the requirement and because some are closely related.

### Grammar Mistakes (focusing on tense, agreement, and critical errors)
1. **Tense inconsistency**: "I had no ounce of doubt that they **can** cut costs..."  
   - **Issue**: Past tense "had" clashes with present tense "can."  
   - **Correction**: "they **could** cut costs..."  

2. **Subject-verb agreement**: "Those who read history **knows**..."  
   - **Issue**: Plural subject "those" requires plural verb "know," not "knows."  
   - **Correction**: "Those who read history **know**..."  

3. **Article omission**: "...seem **to** an unwarranted assault..."  
   - **Issue**: Missing verb after "seem."  
   - **Correction**: "...seem **to be** an unwarranted assault..."  

4. **Pronoun-antecedent disagreement**: "...they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting **day to day** operations."  
   - **Issue**: "Their" (plural) refers to companies (plural), but "day to day" lacks possessive form for clarity.  
   - **Correction**: "...affecting **their** day-to-day operations."  

5. **Tense shift**: "I always knew **we're** in a state of flux."  
   - **Issue**: Past tense "knew" clashes with present contraction "we're" (we are).  
   - **Correction**: "I always knew **we were** in a state of flux."  

6. **Subject-verb agreement**: "...there's actually no tech **jobs** here..."  
   - **Issue**: "There's" (singular) disagrees with plural subject "jobs."  
   - **Correction**: "...there **are** actually no tech jobs here..."

### Serious Stylistic Issues (affecting clarity, tone, or professionalism)
1. **Inflammatory/vulgar language**: "product **enshittification**..."  
   - **Issue**: Highly informal and derogatory term undermines objectivity. Detracts from analytical tone.  

2. **Overuse of sarcasm**: "**In America We Trust** they're capitalist enough..."  
   - **Issue**: Sarcastic tone (mocking the national motto) distracts from the argument and may alienate readers.  

3. **Inappropriate name reference**: "**McKinsey Pichai**..."  
   - **Issue**: Incorrectly conflates "McKinsey" (consulting firm) with Sundar Pichai (Google CEO). Appears unprofessional or mocking.  

4. **Excessive hedging**: "...**I'm sure** are mostly diligent...," "**I can't help but agree**," "**probably** onto something."  
   - **Issue**: Weakens assertions and creates ambiguity. Reduces impact of the argument.  

5. **Informal/colloquial phrasing**: "**So** there's a running story...," "**it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end**."  
   - **Issue**: Overly casual language ("So," "gonna") clashes with the analytical subject matter.  

6. **Redundant phrasing**: "...**squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies**..."  
   - **Issue**: "Squeeze profit from monopolies" is repetitive (monopolies inherently imply profit extraction).  

---

### Other Problems (factual, logical, or structural issues)
1. **Factual inaccuracy**: "**McKinsey Pichai**..."  
   - **Issue**: Incorrect name. Google's CEO is Sundar Pichai; McKinsey is unrelated.  

2. **Unsubstantiated claim**: "...they **can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations**."  
   - **Issue**: Extreme assertion lacks evidence or justification.  

3. **Overgeneralization**: "**every industry goes through this phrase** [phase]..."  
   - **Issue**: "Every industry" is too broad; not all industries follow this pattern (e.g., healthcare, utilities).  

4. **Logical contradiction**: Admits avoiding trades due to ideological reasons ("**hated how I participated**") but later calls the logic "**solid**."  
   - **Issue**: Undermines credibility by dismissing the very logic endorsed.  

5. **Vague reference**: "...**my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses**."  
   - **Issue**: "Funny stack" is ambiguous and uninformative. Fails to clarify the actual problem.  

6. **Unclear analogy**: "**Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance**."  
   - **Issue**: Abstract phrasing with undefined terms ("True Abundance") obscures the point.

**Note**: Minor stylistic/sentence structure issues (e.g., "free money is draining away," "ruthless capitalist engine") were excluded per instructions. [end of text]
