1. **How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?**  
   The first occurrence of the letter **"A"** appears in **"thousand"** — specifically, in **1,000** (*one thousand*). All numbers from *one* to *nine hundred ninety-nine* contain no "A". So you must count to **1,000**.

2. **Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox ..."; What is the sentence famous for?**  
   Completed sentence: **"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."**  
   It’s famous because it’s a **pangram** — a sentence that uses every letter of the English alphabet at least once. It’s commonly used for typing practice, font displays, and keyboard testing.

3. **Short story: The Three Little Pigs meet Little Red Riding Hood**  
   One misty afternoon, the Three Little Pigs were taking a break near the edge of the woods when they heard a commotion — huffing, puffing, and a startled cry. There, near the wolf’s den, stood Little Red Riding Hood, her basket knocked over, and the Big Bad Wolf circling her, tongue lolling.

   “Hold on!” cried the first pig, who’d built his house of straw. He dashed in, but the wolf swatted him aside with a flick of his tail.

   The second pig, who’d built his house of sticks, rushed in too — but the wolf merely knocked over his stick house and growled, “Not today!”

   Then the third pig — the one who’d built his sturdy brick house — arrived. He didn’t charge. Instead, he shouted, “Quick! The wolf hates fire!” He tossed a burning branch into the wolf’s face. The wolf yelped and fled into the forest.

   Red bowed gratefully. “You pigs are clever *and* brave!”  
   The pigs smiled. “And you, little one, are *very* lucky we were building a chimney today.”  
   They shared her pies, and the wolf was never seen near that part of the woods again — unless he brought cookies. 🍪
