Once upon a time, in a small village in the UK, lived a curious little girl named Lily. She loved to explore the world around her, but her favourite adventure was watching the rainbows after a storm.

One sunny day, after a heavy rain, Lily saw a beautiful rainbow arching across the sky. Its colours were brighter and more vivid than she had ever seen before. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet - each colour was like a magical brushstroke on the canvas of the sky.

Lily ran outside, her eyes wide with wonder. She watched as the rainbow slowly faded, its colours blending together like a beautiful painting. She felt a sense of peace and happiness, knowing that even after the storm, there was still beauty to be found.

From that day on, Lily always looked forward to the rain, knowing that it would bring with it the promise of a rainbow. And so, she learned to appreciate the beauty in every storm, and the magic that comes after.
