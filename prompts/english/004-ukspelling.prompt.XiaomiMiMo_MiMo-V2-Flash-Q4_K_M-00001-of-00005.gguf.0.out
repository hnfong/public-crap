<think>Okay, the user is a UK children's writer asking for a short rainbow story under 200 words. They specifically want UK English and simple words. 

Hmm, this seems like a creative writing request - probably for a book or educational material. The word limit suggests it might be for younger readers. I should focus on vivid imagery while keeping vocabulary accessible. 

The rainbow description needs to feel magical but grounded in UK reality. Maybe include classic British elements like rain showers and garden settings. The "double rainbow" idea could work well - it's visually striking but still common in UK weather. 

For language: UK spelling is essential ("colour" not "color"). Simple words like "garden" and "rain" are perfect. The "double rainbow" concept allows for wonder without complex science. 

Structure-wise: Start with rain (setting the scene), then the rainbow reveal. End with the double rainbow as a special moment. Keep sentences short and rhythmic for children. 

Word count check: The draft uses "garden" (UK), "colour" (UK spelling), and simple phrases like "big smile". The double rainbow twist adds excitement within 200 words. 

Final thought: The story should feel like a UK child's perspective - hence "Mum" instead of "Mom". The "double" surprise makes it memorable while staying true to British weather experiences.</think>Here's my favourite rainbow story:

Rain fell softly in our garden. Mum said, "Look up!" I did. A huge rainbow arched across the grey sky. It was bright and bold.

Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. All seven colours shone clear and strong. It looked like a giant smile painted in the sky. I felt a big smile too.

Then, I saw something extra special. Beside the first rainbow, another one appeared! A double rainbow! The second one was paler, like a whisper of colour. Its colours were backwards: violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red.

I loved seeing the double rainbow most. It felt like a secret gift from the rain. Two bright smiles just for me. [end of text]
