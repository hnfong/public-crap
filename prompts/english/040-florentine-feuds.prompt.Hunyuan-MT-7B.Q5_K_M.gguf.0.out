The most strategically prudent course of action for Marco would be to seek out a third party who has both the necessary connections to obtain the rare lapis lazuli and the ability to negotiate with the Medici on his behalf. This third party could be a merchant or diplomat with good relations with both the Medici and the Albizzi families. By using this intermediary, Marco could avoid direct contact with the Medici agents and reduce the risk of arousing the Albizzi's suspicion or anger.

Marco could also try to establish a relationship with a Medici agent through legitimate business dealings or other means of exchange, in order to build trust and potentially gain their cooperation in obtaining the lapis lazuli. However, this would require careful planning and caution, as any sign of dishonesty or betrayal could have serious consequences for Marco.

Another option would be to seek out alternative sources of lapis lazuli that are not controlled by the Medici, although this might be more difficult to find and could result in a higher cost.

Ultimately, the most important factor for Marco is to fulfill the commission successfully while protecting his long-term livelihood and standing within Florentine society. This means carefully weighing the risks and benefits of each option and making a decision that maximizes his chances of success while minimizing the potential for negative consequences.
