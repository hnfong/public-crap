Here is a detailed review of the text, focusing on **grammar (especially tense and agreement issues)**, **serious stylistic issues**, and **other problems**, with at least **5 issues in each category**:

---

### **Grammar Issues (Tense & Agreement)**

1. **Tense inconsistency**:  
   - *"I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG."*  
     The past tense "wondered" is followed by a conditional clause ("would be") which is correct, but the sentence structure is awkward and could be clearer.

2. **Subject-verb agreement**:  
   - *"I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations."*  
     "They can" should be "they could" for consistency with the past tense "had."

3. **Tense inconsistency in hypotheticals**:  
   - *"I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years..."*  
     The future tense "will be" is correct, but the preceding "I'm not sure" is in present tense, which is fine, but the sentence could be smoother.

4. **Misuse of past perfect**:  
   - *"In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude..."*  
     The past perfect ("would have hated") is used correctly, but the sentence is unnecessarily complex and could be simplified.

5. **Incorrect use of "there's" vs. "there are"**:  
   - *"In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose."*  
     "They're" is correct, but the phrase "In America We Trust" is a bit awkward and should be rephrased for clarity.

### **Stylistic Issues**

1. **Awkward phrasing and wordiness**:  
   - *"I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective."*  
     The phrase "I can't help but agree" is overused and could be replaced with something more concise.

2. **Overuse of parentheses and asides**:  
   - *"(There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)"*  
     The parentheses and dashes create a cluttered, informal tone that detracts from the argument.

3. **Inconsistent tone and register**:  
   - *"I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally..."*  
     The informal tone ("I mean") clashes with the more analytical tone of the rest of the text.

4. **Overuse of jargon and acronyms**:  
   - *"levels.fyi" and "GOOG" (and particularly GOOG)"*  
     While "GOOG" is standard in finance, "levels.fyi" is a specific website and should be spelled out or explained for clarity.

5. **Redundant or unclear phrasing**:  
   - *"Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance."*  
     The phrase "True Abundance" is capitalized for emphasis, but it's unclear what the author means by it. The sentence could be rephrased for clarity.

### **Other Problems**

1. **Lack of clear structure or flow**:  
   - The text jumps between topics (e.g., Andreessen Horowitz, tech layoffs, personal financial decisions, and long-term predictions) without clear transitions or organization.

2. **Overuse of rhetorical questions and informal language**:  
   - *"I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally..."*  
     The rhetorical question and informal tone ("I mean") weaken the argument and make the text feel less professional.

3. **Unclear or unsupported claims**:  
   - *"I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations."*  
     The claim is strong but lacks evidence or explanation, making it seem like an opinion rather than an argument.

4. **Ambiguous references**:  
   - *"In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose."*  
     The phrase "In America We Trust" is unclear and could be rephrased for clarity.

5. **Lack of conclusion or synthesis**:  
   - The text ends abruptly with *"That said, it has been a fun ride."* without summarizing the main points or offering a final perspective.

### Summary of Key Fixes

- **Grammar**: Fix tense inconsistencies, subject-verb agreement, and clarify hypotheticals.
- **Style**: Simplify wordy sentences, reduce informal language, and improve flow.
- **Clarity**: Define acronyms, clarify ambiguous references, and support claims with evidence.
- **Structure**: Organize ideas more cohesively and provide a stronger conclusion.
