In the UK, there's a special rainbow I love to see.

It's the one that dances across the sky after a storm. The raindrops sparkle like diamonds, and the sun peeks out to paint the sky.

The first arch is a deep blue, like the ocean. Then, a bright orange, like a pumpkin. Red, yellow, and green follow, like a rainbow cake.

The end is a soft purple, like a princess's dress. It's a magical moment, a gift from the sky.

I watch it with a smile, knowing it's a sign of a brighter day. [end of text]
