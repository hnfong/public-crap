The passage appears to be written on April 1st. The hint provided is the distinctive writing style of the article, which is connected to one particular day and month of the year. The writing style is satirical and humorous, which is characteristic of April Fool's Day. The author's critique of Rust and praise for C++ are exaggerated and seem to be making fun of the preferences and debates within the programming community. Additionally, the mention of "Linebender projects" and the call for people to join their Zulip instance could be a playful reference to a fictional project created for the sake of the joke. The references to future C++ features and the critique of the Rust community's code of conduct also contribute to the satirical tone of the piece. The suggestion to discuss the topic on Hacker News and /r/rust further implies that the author is aware of the community's reaction to such a post and is likely expecting a humorous response.
