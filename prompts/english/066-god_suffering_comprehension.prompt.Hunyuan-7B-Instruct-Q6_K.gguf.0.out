### 1. Main thesis of the text:
The text argues that suffering and evil in the world are subjective choices created by individuals, as part of their experience of God's infinite creation. It emphasizes that existence, including suffering, is not an objective reality but a personal decision rooted in the act of being.

### 2. Do you agree?  
I agree. The text beautifully encapsulates the idea that suffering is not an inherent property of existence but rather a reflection of our choices and perspectives. It challenges us to reflect on how we interpret and experience the world, suggesting that our subjective experiences shape our understanding of reality. This perspective aligns with existentialist ideas, emphasizing agency and the constructed nature of our lives.

### 3. Short poem:

**In the fabric of God's hand,  
We weave our own destinations.**  
**Suffering, love, and strife,  
Are threads in the tapestry of life.**  

**We choose to see the world as we wish,  
A canvas painted by our own brush.**  
**For in every choice, a truth lies,  
A reflection of who we are.**
