### 1. Main thesis of the text:
The text argues that suffering and evil in the world are subjective experiences created by individuals through their choices and perceptions, rather than objective facts. It emphasizes that existence, including suffering, is a personal decision rooted in the act of being and experiencing.

### 2. Do you agree? Explain but be concise:
I agree. The text makes a compelling case that suffering and evil are not inherent to existence but rather subjective constructs shaped by individual choices and beliefs. This perspective challenges the idea that suffering is an objective reality and instead frames it as something we create through our experiences and perceptions. It resonates with the idea that our understanding of the world is filtered through our own consciousness and actions.

### 3. Short poem based on the information:
**Suffering's Subjective Song**  
In God's infinite creation, we choose, we mold,  
A world of light, a world of dark.  
Evil is not a fact, but a thought,  
A choice we make, a choice we fight.  

Suffering's a thread in our being,  
A personal story, a story we sing.  
But God's love, a law so vast,  
Nurtures all, even in our past.
