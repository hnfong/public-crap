Hello! I am a Form 4 student in Hong Kong. I like writing story very much, although my English is still not very good. I hope you don't mind my grammar mistake. Here is a story about my friend, he is a wood elf but nobody knows.

The bell rang at 8:00 a.m. It was time for morning assembly. The Hong Kong sun was very hot, shining on the black asphalt playground. All the students were wearing white shirt and grey skirt or trousers. We stood in rows, listening to the principal talk about the exam results.

I stood next to my best friend, Lam. Lam looked very tired. His face was pale. Under the hot sun, everyone was sweating, but Lam looked like he was melting.

"Are you okay?" I whispered to him.

Lam nodded slowly. "I think... the air conditioner is not enough," he whispered back.

But we were outside. There is no air conditioner outside.

Lam is a very strange boy. He is very tall and very thin. His hair is light brown, which is rare for Hong Kong people. He always sits at the back of the classroom. He loves Biology lesson the most. When the teacher talks about photosynthesis, his eyes become very bright.

But nobody knows his secret. Lam is actually a wood elf.

I discovered this last year. We were studying in the library. I fell asleep on my textbook. When I woke up, I saw a small green vine growing from Lam’s finger! It was wrapping around his pen. When he saw me wake up, the vine quickly disappeared. He was very nervous. He told me he came from a magic forest, but he had to come to the city to study.

Being a wood elf in a Hong Kong secondary school is very hard.

First, the uniform is very uncomfortable. Lam says the polyester fabric feels like plastic on his skin. He prefers cotton, or better, leaves. But he cannot wear leaves to school, or the discipline teacher will catch him.

Second, the air is very dirty. In the forest, the air is fresh and full of oxygen. In Mong Kok, the air is full of bus smoke and dust. Lam always wears a face mask, even before the pandemic. He says it helps him filter the bad air.

Third, he is allergic to Wi-Fi. I am not joking. Lam says the radio waves make his ears ring. When the Wi-Fi router is too close, his hair stands up. So, he always turns off his phone data. He is the only student I know who does not use Instagram.

One day, during lunch time, we went to the park near our school. Lam looked very sad. He sat on a bench under a Banyan tree.

"I miss the trees," Lam said softly. "The trees in the city are lonely. They cannot talk to each other because the concrete blocks them."

I looked at the big tree. It looked old and tired. "Can you talk to it?" I asked.

Lam smiled. He put his hand on the tree trunk. Suddenly, I felt a cool breeze. The leaves on the tree started to shake, even though there was no wind. A few yellow leaves fell down, but they did not hit the ground. They floated around Lam like a halo.

Lam closed his eyes. He looked peaceful. For a moment, he didn't look like a tired student. He looked magical.

Then, the school bell rang again. The magic stopped. The leaves fell on the ground. Lam opened his eyes and sighed.

"Time for Math lesson," he said. He stood up and adjusted his tie. "I really hate Calculus."

I laughed. "Come on, elf boy. If you fail the exam, your mom will be angry."

Lam smiled. "Okay, let's go."

We walked back to the school building. Lam walked with a bounce in his step. The city was noisy and crowded, but Lam looked okay. Maybe because he touched the tree, or maybe because he had a friend who knew his secret.

Being a wood elf in Hong Kong is difficult, but I think Lam is doing a good job. He is just trying to survive Form 4, just like me. [end of text]
