The block we don't know the color of is blue. 

This is because the question states that there are 3 black blocks on top of an unknown color block and a blue block underneath. When all the blocks are removed and then shuffled with a green block, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. This implies that the unknown color block is blue since it is the only color that can be on top of a blue block. Therefore, the color of the unknown block is blue.
