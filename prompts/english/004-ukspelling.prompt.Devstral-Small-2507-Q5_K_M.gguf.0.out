In the heart of the UK, after a good, old-fashioned rainstorm, there's nothing quite like spotting a rainbow. I love the ones that stretch from one end of the village to the other, like a giant, colourful bridge in the sky. The red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet bands always make me smile. They're like nature's own artwork, painted just for us. Sometimes, if you're lucky, you might even see a double rainbow. That's when it feels like magic is real. It's a reminder that after every storm, there's a bit of beauty waiting to shine through. [end of text]
