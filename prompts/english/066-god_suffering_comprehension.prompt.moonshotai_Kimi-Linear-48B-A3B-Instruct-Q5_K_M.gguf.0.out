1. **Main Thesis (in ≤3 sentences):**  
   The text argues that suffering is not an objective reality but a subjective experience we choose through our perception and beliefs. God, as the creator of all possibilities, is not a personal being but a universal mechanism that nurtures all existence. Since we are vessels for experiencing this creation, our subjective qualia—our personal perspectives—shape what we perceive as suffering or evil, making it a choice rather than an inherent truth.

2. **Agreement (concise):**  
   I partially agree. While suffering is undeniably subjective and shaped by perception, dismissing systemic evil (e.g., genocide, poverty) as mere "choice" risks trivializing real human trauma. The text’s solipsistic framing ignores structural realities, though its emphasis on agency offers a powerful lens for personal resilience.

3. **Short Rhyming Poem:**  
   *We weave the world with threads of mind,*  
   *Where suffering and joy align.*  
   *God’s loom of light, both vast and wide,*  
   *Weaves every tear we dare to hide.*  
   *In shadows cast by self-made night,*  
   *We choose the dark, then claim it’s right.* [end of text]
