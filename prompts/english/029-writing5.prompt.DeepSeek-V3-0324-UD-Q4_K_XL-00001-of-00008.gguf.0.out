**The Secret Wood Elf**  

Lena had always felt different. At school, she was just another quiet student—good at art, average in sports, and always a little too fond of trees. But what her classmates didn’t know was that Lena wasn’t entirely human. She was a wood elf, hiding her true nature in the bustling human world.  

Her pointed ears were carefully hidden under her long, dark hair, and she wore gloves to cover the faint, leaf-like patterns on her skin. She avoided crowded places, preferring the quiet corners of the school garden, where she could whisper to the plants and listen to their soft, rustling replies.  

One day, during a biology field trip to a nearby forest, Lena’s secret nearly slipped. While the other students struggled to identify tree species, she instinctively knew each one—their names, their ages, even their moods. The teacher, Mr. Thompson, raised an eyebrow. "Lena, how do you know so much about these trees?"  

She hesitated. "I… read a lot."  

But her best friend, Jake, had noticed other strange things—how she never got tired during long hikes, how birds seemed to follow her, and how she could find the rarest flowers with ease. One afternoon, he finally confronted her.  

"Lena, what’s going on? You’re not… normal, are you?"  

Her heart pounded. She had kept her secret for so long. But Jake’s eyes weren’t accusing—just curious. Taking a deep breath, she pulled off her gloves, revealing the delicate, vine-like markings on her hands.  

"I’m a wood elf," she admitted.  

Jake’s jaw dropped. Then, to her surprise, he grinned. "That. Is. So. Cool."  

From that day on, Jake became her ally, helping her hide her magic when needed but also encouraging her to embrace it. Lena still had to navigate homework, exams, and school drama—but now, she had someone who truly understood her.  

And sometimes, when no one was looking, she’d let the wind carry her laughter through the trees, reminding herself that even in a human world, she belonged. [end of text]
