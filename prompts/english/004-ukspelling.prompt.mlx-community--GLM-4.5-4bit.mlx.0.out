==========
My favourite rainbows are the shy ones.

They pop up after a summer shower, when the sun peeks out. The air smells fresh and clean. You have to look for them, high up in the sky.

They are made of the brightest colours you can imagine. A perfect, glowing arc of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. It feels like a magic bridge painted just for you.

Sometimes, if you are very lucky, you can see a fainter rainbow above it. That is the best one of all. It feels like a special, secret gift.

For a few minutes, the world feels full of wonder. Then, just as quietly as it arrived, the rainbow fades away. But the happy feeling it gives you stays for a long, long time.
