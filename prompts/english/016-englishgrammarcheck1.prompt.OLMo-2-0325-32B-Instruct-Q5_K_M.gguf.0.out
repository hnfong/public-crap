**Grammar Mistakes (especially tense and "agreement" issues):**

1. The use of "were down" (past tense) and "is" (present tense) in the same context about tech stocks creates a tense inconsistency.
2. "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic" - "was" should agree with "analysis," but the sentence structure could be clearer.
3. "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs" - "can" should be "could" to maintain consistency with the past tense context.
4. "McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready" - This seems to be a mix-up. It should be either "Sundar Pichai" (CEO of Google) or clarify if "McKinsey Pichai" is intended as a humorous or satirical reference.
5. "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough" - The phrase "In America We Trust" seems to be a play on words but disrupts the flow and grammatical agreement. It should be rephrased for clarity.

**Serious Stylistic Issues:**

1. The text contains a mix of formal and informal language, which can be jarring. For instance, "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something" juxtaposed with "enshittification" creates a stylistic inconsistency.
2. The use of parentheses for asides "(GOOG mainly)" and "(There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors)" disrupts the flow and could be integrated into the main text more smoothly.
3. The text lacks a clear structure, jumping from personal reflections to market analysis without clear transitions, making it difficult to follow.
4. The use of "we're in a state of flux" without clear antecedent or explanation may confuse readers unfamiliar with the industry's dynamics.
5. The concluding sentence "I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally" is convoluted and could be simplified for clarity.

**Other Problems:**

1. The term "enshittification" is not standard and may be inappropriate for some audiences, potentially alienating readers.
2. The reference to "McKinsey Pichai" is unclear and could be misleading to those unfamiliar with the context.
3. The statement "I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude" lacks clarity on the decision-making process.
4. The text lacks specific examples or data to support the claims about tech companies' monopolies and profitability, which could strengthen the argument.
5. The conclusion does not provide a clear takeaway or summary, leaving the reader without a strong final impression. [end of text]
