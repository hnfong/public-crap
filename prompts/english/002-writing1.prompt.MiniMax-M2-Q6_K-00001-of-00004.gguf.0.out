The old woman’s hands were always busy, stitching quilts and mending socks, but when she sat by the window, she would rest her cheek against the cool pillow and look up at the sky. She told stories about the cloud that drifted over her house, how it was shaped like a ship, or a dragon, or a sleeping cat. The children would listen, wide-eyed, and she would smile, knowing she was exaggerating just a little, because the cloud was really just a cloud, and the stories were just stories. But the stories were not about the cloud at all. They were about the way her husband used to bring her tea on rainy mornings, how he would hum while he worked, how he would hold her hand when the world felt too heavy. They were about the way her daughter would call from far away, her voice warm and bright, and the way her grandson would climb into her lap and fall asleep against her shoulder. The stories were about the love that stitched the days together, the love that made a simple pillow feel like a soft harbor, and a passing cloud feel like a blessing. And when the children grew up and faced their own storms, they would remember her stories, and the way she had exaggerated the joy, and they would understand that love is not a grand, distant thing, but a quiet, constant presence, a warm hand in the dark, a soft place to rest your head, a story that makes the ordinary world feel like a miracle.
