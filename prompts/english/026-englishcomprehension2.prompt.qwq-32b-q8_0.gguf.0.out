Question:

There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block. We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of blue block.

What color is the block we don't know the color of? Only answer in one word. Don't explain.

Okay, let's try to figure this out step by step. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll take it slowly.

First, the problem says there are 3 black blocks on top of an unknown color block. Let's call that unknown block X. So the original stack from bottom to top would be: something (maybe the ground?), then a blue block, then the unknown block X, then three black blocks on top of X. Wait, hold on. Wait, the problem says "beneath them there is a blue block." Hmm, maybe I need to parse that again.

The original setup: "There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block." So the structure is: the three black blocks are on top of the unknown block (X). Then beneath those (the unknown block and the blacks?), there's a blue block. Wait, maybe the order is: starting from the bottom, there's a blue block, then the unknown block X, then the three black blocks on top of X. Because "beneath them" (the three black blocks and X?) the blue is underneath. So the original stack from bottom up is blue, X, then three blacks.

Then, they remove all blocks, add a green one, shuffle all the blocks (including the green), and put them back on top of each other. After that, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. We need to find the color of X.

Wait, but where does the yellow block come from? The original blocks were 3 black, X (unknown), blue, and then they added a green. So the total blocks after adding green are: 3 black, X, blue, green. But the problem mentions a yellow block in the new arrangement. So maybe the unknown block X is yellow? Or perhaps the yellow was part of the original blocks? Wait, the problem didn't mention a yellow block before the shuffling. Wait, the problem says "the yellow block is on top of blue block" after shuffling. So the yellow must be one of the existing blocks. Since the original blocks were 3 black, X, blue, and then they added a green. So the total blocks are 3 black, X, blue, green. So the yellow must be either X or one of the others. But the original blocks didn't have a yellow, so X must be yellow? Because otherwise, where did the yellow come from? Wait, the problem says "shuffle the blocks with one additional green block". So the original blocks were 3 black, X, and blue. Then adding a green makes total of 3+1+1 (blue is part of original?) Wait, maybe the original blocks are the 3 black, X, and the blue beneath them. So total original blocks are 3 black + X + blue. Then when they remove all blocks, they have those, plus add a green, so total blocks are 3 black, X, blue, green. So the yellow must be X, because otherwise there's no yellow block. Because the problem states that after shuffling and stacking, the yellow is on top of blue. Therefore, X must be yellow. Because otherwise, there's no yellow block in the set. So the unknown block X is yellow. Therefore, the answer is yellow.
