The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed with a frequency that made Elara's ears twitch. To anyone else, it was just the annoying buzz of a broken ballast. To Elara, it sounded like a thousand tiny, angry beetles drilling into her skull.

She adjusted her backpack straps, trying to make herself smaller. She was seventeen, or at least, she looked seventeen. In reality, she was three hundred and twelve years old, a Wood Elf from the Whispering Canopy, currently hiding in the human world under a glamour that made her skin look slightly too pale and her eyes a shade too green.

"Hey, Elara! You coming to the cafeteria?"

It was Marcus, the class president, a boy whose energy levels seemed to defy the laws of physics. He was waving a tray of pizza like a flag of surrender.

"Sure," Elara said, her voice soft, careful not to let the melodic lilt of her native tongue slip out. "Just... give me a second."

She needed a moment. The air in the hallway was thick with the scent of floor wax, stale sweat, and the metallic tang of anxiety. It was suffocating. She closed her eyes for a split second, reaching out with her senses, trying to find the one thing that grounded her: the earth.

*There.*

Beneath the concrete foundation of the school, deep in the soil, the roots of the ancient oak tree in the courtyard were whispering. They were thirsty. They were worried about the construction crew digging a new parking lot next week.

"Elara? You okay? You look like you're about to faint." Marcus was frowning.

"I'm fine," she lied, opening her eyes. "Just... thinking about biology."

"Right. The mitosis thing?"

"Something like that."

Elara walked with him, but her mind was elsewhere. Being a Wood Elf in a high school was a constant exercise in suppression. She couldn't run fast enough to dodge a dodgeball without looking like a blur. She couldn't speak to the plants in the garden without them immediately blooming out of season. She had to eat processed food, even though it tasted like ash to her, and she had to pretend she didn't hear the wind complaining about the lack of trees.

The bell rang, a harsh, jarring sound that made her flinch.

"First period: Advanced Chemistry," Marcus announced, leading the way. "Mr. Henderson is going to be mad if we're late again."

Elara followed, her heart pounding. Chemistry was the hardest subject. The chemicals smelled like poison. The reactions felt violent and unnatural.

In the lab, the air was thick with the smell of sulfur and burnt plastic. Elara sat at her station, staring at the Bunsen burner.

"Okay, pair up," Mr. Henderson barked. "Today, we're synthesizing a simple ester. Marcus, you're with Elara."

Marcus grinned. "Finally, a chance to show off my mixing skills."

As they worked, Elara felt the familiar itch in her fingertips. The glass beaker was cold, but the metal stand was warm. She could feel the heat radiating from the burner, but she could also feel the *life* in the glass, the way the silica atoms were arranged. It was beautiful, in a chaotic, human way.

"Careful with the acid," Marcus warned, pouring a clear liquid. "Don't splash it."

"I know," Elara whispered. She held her breath. She didn't want to sneeze. If she sneezed, the pollen in her hair might react with the chemicals, causing a minor explosion. Or worse, the plants in the corner of the room might suddenly grow vines and strangle the fire extinguisher.

She focused on the task. She mixed the solution, her movements precise, almost too precise.

"Whoa," Marcus said, leaning in. "You're mixing it faster than the instructions say. How are you doing that?"

"Muscle memory," Elara said quickly. "I practiced a lot."

"Right. Well, it's working. Look at the color change."

The solution turned a vibrant, impossible shade of violet.

"Is that supposed to happen?" Marcus asked, his eyes wide.

Elara froze. In the Whispering Canopy, violets were the color of twilight. Here, it was just a chemical reaction. But the way the light hit the liquid... it felt alive.

"Maybe it's a new catalyst," Elara said, her voice trembling slightly. "Let's just... let it cool down."

They watched the beaker. The violet hue pulsed, just for a second, like a heartbeat.

"Okay, that's weird," Marcus muttered. "But cool. Weird, but cool."

The bell rang again, signaling the end of the period. As they packed up, Elara felt a sudden, overwhelming urge to run. The school felt like a cage. The concrete walls were pressing in.

"Hey, Elara," Marcus said, slinging his bag over his shoulder. "You want to walk to the bus stop? I heard there's a new coffee shop opening near the park."

Elara looked at him. He was so bright, so loud, so *human*. He didn't know she was an alien in his world. He didn't know she spent her nights listening to the wind through the trees in the park, trying to remember what it felt like to be part of the forest.

"Yeah," she said, a small smile touching her lips. "I'd like that."

As they walked out of the school, the afternoon sun hit the pavement. Elara took a deep breath. The air was still full of exhaust fumes and noise, but she could feel the grass in the park nearby, stretching its roots toward the sunlight.

She wasn't just a student anymore. She was a bridge. A Wood Elf in a world of concrete, learning that even in the most unnatural places, life found a way to grow.

"Hey, Marcus?" she asked as they reached the sidewalk.

"Yeah?"

"Thanks for the company. It's... nice to have a friend."

Marcus laughed, a loud, unselfconscious sound. "Anytime, Elara. Anytime."

Elara watched him walk away, then turned toward the park. She took a step, and for a moment, just a moment, the pavement seemed to soften beneath her feet, turning into moss. She smiled, closed her eyes, and listened to the wind.

It was a long way from the Whispering Canopy, but it was home enough for today. [end of text]
