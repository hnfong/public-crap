1. Grammar mistakes:
   - "While this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers..." should be "While this might seem like an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers..."
   - "In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG." should be "In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- specifically META and GOOG."
   - "That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit..." should be "That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase profits..."
   - "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." should be "And as we've seen with their (mainly GOOG's) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard."
   - "With interest rates still held 'high', the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech)," should be "With interest rates still high, the free money is draining away, and with the promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (except for small pockets of AI, which are currently much less operational than general tech),"

2. Serious stylistic issues:
   - The text uses a lot of passive voice, which can make it difficult for readers to identify the speaker's perspective and emotions.
   - The tone of the text is somewhat negative and cynical, which may not always be appropriate for the context.
   - There is a lack of clarity and coherence in some parts of the text, making it difficult for readers to follow the author's argument.

3. Other problems:
   - The text is quite long and complex, which may make it difficult for some readers to understand the main points.
   - The author makes several claims without providing sufficient evidence or explanation, which can weaken the credibility of the argument. [end of text]
