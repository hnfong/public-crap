In the heart of the UK, there's a special kind of rainbow that I love the most. It's not the ones you see after a storm, but the ones that appear on a sunny day, when the rain has just stopped. These are called "sunshowers."

Imagine this: you're walking through a park, the sun is shining, and suddenly, a light drizzle starts. You open your umbrella, and as you look up, you see a beautiful rainbow arching across the sky. The colours are bright and clear - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. It's like a magical bridge between the earth and the sky.

These sunshower rainbows are my favourite because they bring a sense of wonder and joy. They remind me that even on a rainy day, there's always a bit of sunshine waiting to shine through. And isn't that a wonderful thing to remember? [end of text]
