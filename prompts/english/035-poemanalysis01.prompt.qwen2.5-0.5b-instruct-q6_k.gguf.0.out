The phrase "inertia of running" is a common expression that refers to the tendency of an object to continue moving in a straight line unless acted upon by an external force. In the context of Mario's run, this could be interpreted as the inertia of his running, which makes him slip into the abyss.

The skill issue in this context could be interpreted as Mario's lack of skill in executing his run properly. Mario's run is described as "skill issue," which suggests that he is not performing his run with the appropriate technique or coordination. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as poor form, lack of practice, or a general lack of skill in the game.

Overall, the phrase "inertia of running" and the skill issue in Mario's run suggest that there is a problem with Mario's execution of his run, which could be due to a variety of factors, such as poor form, lack of practice, or a general lack of skill in the game. [end of text]
