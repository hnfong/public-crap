My favourite rainbows aren’t in the sky.

They’re in the garden, after the rain.

Mum says it’s the sun poking through the clouds, and the raindrops holding light like tiny prisms. I run barefoot through the wet grass, chasing them.

One rainbow dances on the garden hose. Another glints on a puddle near the shed. I crouch down and wiggle my toes in the cool water—suddenly, a whole rainbow spills across my socks!

Mum says rainbows are magic, but I think they’re just the sun playing hide-and-seek with the raindrops. Every time the sun peeks out, the garden sparkles with little arcs of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet—like a giant crayon dropped in the grass.

I don’t need a sky rainbow. My garden ones are better. They’re sticky with grass, and they smell like rain. And they’re mine. [end of text]
