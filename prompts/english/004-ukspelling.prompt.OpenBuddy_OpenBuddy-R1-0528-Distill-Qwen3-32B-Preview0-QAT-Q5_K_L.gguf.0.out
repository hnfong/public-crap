Once upon a time, in a small village in the UK, there lived a young girl named Lily. She loved nothing more than the rainbows that appeared after a heavy rain. Her favourite rainbows were the ones that stretched across the sky, from one end of the village to the other.

Lily would run outside as soon as she saw the first signs of a rainbow. She would stand in the middle of the field, with her arms outstretched, and watch as the rainbow grew brighter and brighter. She would close her eyes and imagine that she was walking on the rainbow, with each step taking her closer to the pot of gold at the end.

Lily's favourite part of the rainbow was the colours. She loved the way the red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet blended together to create a beautiful masterpiece. She would often try to count the number of colours, but she always got lost in the beauty of the rainbow.

As the rainbow faded away, Lily would feel a sense of sadness. But she knew that soon enough, another rainbow would appear, and she would be able to experience the magic all over again. [end of text]
