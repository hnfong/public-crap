Consider this scenario:

Alice: Are you eating healthy?
Bob: Yes! Today I ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat.
Alice: Wow! Let me see.
Bob: (sends Alice a photo)
Alice: wtf

Question: what happened? What did Bob eat and was it healthy?

Based on the conversation, it seems that Bob claimed to have eaten a dish made with aged organic milk, seasoned tomato purée, and baked whole wheat. However, when he sent Alice a photo of the dish, she reacted with confusion or disbelief, indicated by her "wtf" response.

It's difficult to determine exactly what Bob ate without seeing the photo, but the ingredients he listed suggest that he may have eaten a type of savory dish, possibly a variation of a pasta or grain-based dish. The use of aged organic milk, seasoned tomato purée, and baked whole wheat could potentially make for a healthy meal, depending on the preparation and portion size.

However, Alice's reaction suggests that the dish may have looked unappetizing or unusual, which could mean that it was not prepared in a typical or appealing way. Without more information, it's impossible to say for sure what Bob ate or whether it was truly healthy.
