### 1. **How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?**

You would have to count **100** before you would use the letter **"A"** in the English spelling of a whole number.

- Numbers are spelled out in English using a specific set of words:
  - 1 = one  
  - 2 = two  
  - 3 = three  
  - ...  
  - 10 = ten  
  - 11 = eleven  
  - 12 = twelve  
  - ...  
  - 19 = nineteen  
  - 20 = twenty  
  - 21 = twenty-one  
  - ...  
  - 99 = ninety-nine  
  - 100 = one hundred  
  - Here, the word **"one"** contains the letter **"A"**.

So, **100** is the first number where the letter **"A"** appears in the English spelling.

**"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."**

### 3. **Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.**

Once upon a time, in a cozy forest village, there lived three little pigs: **Porky**, **Benny**, and **Terry**. Each built a house — Porky made his of straw, Benny of sticks, and Terry of bricks.

One day, while walking through the woods, **Little Red Riding Hood** came by, carrying a basket of treats for her grandmother. She was lost and asked the pigs for directions.

Porky, who lived in the straw house, was too busy playing with his toys to help. Benny, in his stick house, was too busy building a birdhouse. Terry, in his sturdy brick house, welcomed her in and offered her a warm drink.

As they talked, Terry noticed Red Riding Hood was worried. She told him she was afraid of the Big Bad Wolf. Terry reassured her and offered to walk with her to her grandmother’s house.

On the way, they met the Big Bad Wolf, who tried to scare them. But Terry stood tall and brave, and the wolf ran away.

Red Riding Hood was so grateful that she gave Terry a basket of cookies and promised to visit again.

From that day on, Terry became known as the **Brave Brick Pig**, and the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became great friends.
