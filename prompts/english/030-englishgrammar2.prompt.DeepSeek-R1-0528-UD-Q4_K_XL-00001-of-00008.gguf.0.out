Okay, the user wants me to review English translations of Cantonese sentences and suggest improvements. The translations were done by a native Cantonese speaker who might not be strong in English. I need to make the English sound natural, simple, and fluent, like a native speaker would write it. If a sentence is already good, I should just keep it as is.

Looking at the first sentence: "Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?" The original Cantonese has a tone of reassurance, like "Why rush? They'll definitely wait for you." The English translation is grammatically off—"hurry" should be "hurrying"—and it's wordy with two questions. I can combine it into one smoother phrase: "Why are you in such a hurry? They'll wait for you." That captures the meaning better and sounds more natural.

For the second sentence: "He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids." "Magnanimous" is too formal and uncommon in everyday speech. "Haggle" usually refers to bargaining over prices, not petty arguments. A simpler way would be: "He's very generous and doesn't argue with kids over small things." This uses common words and flows better.

The third sentence is: "There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it." It's almost perfect, but "learn" should be "learning" to match the gerund form after "to." Also, "massive exposure" is fine, but "a lot of exposure" sounds more conversational. So I'll tweak it to: "There's no shortcut to learning a language; it requires a lot of exposure."

Fourth sentence: "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender." "Tender" is odd here—it's more for food or physical sensitivity. "Gentle" is the right word for describing a person's nature. Also, "for her being very tender" is clunky. Better to say: "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for being so gentle." That's concise and natural.

Fifth sentence: "I take the metro to school every day." This one is flawless. "Metro" is commonly used in many English-speaking cities, and the structure is simple and correct. No changes needed.

Overall, I'm focusing on making the language idiomatic and easy to read, while preserving the original intent. The user seems to want help refining translations for clarity and fluency, probably for practical use like communication or learning. I'll provide clear suggestions without overcomplicating things.

Here are the reviewed translations with suggested modifications for natural, fluent English:

1. **Original:** Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?  
   **Suggested sentence:** Why are you in such a hurry? They'll wait for you.  
   *(Reason: Corrects grammar ("hurry" → "in such a hurry"), combines ideas smoothly, and uses a reassuring tone like the Cantonese.)*

2. **Original:** He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids.  
   **Suggested sentence:** He’s very generous and doesn’t argue with kids over small things.  
   *(Reason: Replaces overly formal "magnanimous" and "haggle" with common words. "Trivial issues" → "small things" for simplicity. Removes redundancy.)*

3. **Original:** There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it.  
   **Suggested sentence:** There’s no shortcut to learning a language; it takes a lot of exposure.  
   *(Reason: "Learn" → "learning" (gerund after preposition). "Massive exposure" is slightly unnatural; "a lot of exposure" flows better. "The key is" replaced with active "it takes".)*

4. **Original:** Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender.  
   **Suggested sentence:** Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for being so gentle.  
   *(Reason: "Tender" is rarely used for personality (implies physical softness). "Gentle" is the natural equivalent for 温柔. "For her being very tender" is awkward; simplified to "for being so gentle".)*

5. **Original:** I take the metro to school every day.  
   **Suggested sentence:** I take the metro to school every day. *(No changes needed. Sentence is simple, grammatically correct, and natural.)* [end of text]
