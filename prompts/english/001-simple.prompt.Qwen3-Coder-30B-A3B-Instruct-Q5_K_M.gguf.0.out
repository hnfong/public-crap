3. Once upon a time, the three little pigs were walking through the forest when they encountered Little Red Riding Hood on the path. The pigs were surprised to see her, as they had never met a girl who wore such a distinctive red hood.

"Good day, little pigs," said Little Red Riding Hood, "I'm on my way to visit my grandmother. Would you like to join me?"

The first pig, who was quite clever, suggested they travel together for safety. "We can help each other," he said. "The forest can be dangerous, especially for a young girl like you."

The second pig, who was very strong, offered to carry her basket of food. "I'll make sure your grandmother gets her provisions safely," he said.

The third pig, who was very wise, suggested they all travel together and keep each other company. "We can watch out for any dangers," he said.

Together, they walked through the forest, sharing stories and keeping each other company. When they reached the grandmother's house, they all helped Little Red Riding Hood deliver her food and visit her grandmother. The three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became good friends, and they often met again to share stories and adventures. [end of text]
