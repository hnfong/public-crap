Here is a review of the provided text, focusing on **grammar (especially tense and subject-verb agreement)**, **serious stylistic issues**, and **other significant problems**. Minor stylistic or sentence flow issues are excluded per your instructions.

### **Grammar Issues (Tense & Agreement)**

1. **"So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..."**  
   → *Issue:* "Andreessen Horowitz" is a firm (plural entity), so pronouns/verbs should reflect that. "Saying" implies ongoing action, but "there's" (singular) doesn't agree with the plural subject. Better: "There’s a running critique from Andreessen Horowitz..." or "Andreessen Horowitz are saying..."

2. **"While this might seem to an unwarranted assault..."**  
   → *Issue:* Missing preposition. Should be: "might seem **like** an unwarranted assault" or "**to be** an unwarranted assault."

3. **"My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable..."**  
   → *Issue:* Tense mismatch. "Was" (past) followed by "don't seem" (present). Since the analysis occurred in the past and referred to present conditions at that time, it should be: "didn't seem to be capable."

4. **"They can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down."**  
   → *Issue:* "Monopolies" is plural, but earlier only one monopoly per company is implied. Either use singular ("the monopoly") or rephrase to justify plural.

5. **"I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half..."**  
   → *Issue:* Tense inconsistency. "I had" (past) should be followed by "could cut" (past conditional), not "can cut" (present). Correct: "that they **could** cut costs..."

### **Serious Stylistic Issues**

1. **Overuse of informal tone and slang in a semi-analytical context:**  
   Phrases like "McKinsey Pichai," "In America We Trust," "party's gonna end," and "funny stack" undermine credibility and create an inconsistent tone, especially when discussing economic logic and investment analysis.

2. **Inconsistent capitalization of company names:**  
   Using "META" and "GOOG" (stock tickers) is acceptable, but doing so repeatedly while mixing in informal references like "GOOG mainly" or "what GOOG will be like" blurs clarity. Either use full names (Meta, Google) consistently or explain the use of tickers.

3. **Use of sarcasm and mockery ("McKinsey Pichai") without sufficient context:**  
   This is a loaded, potentially offensive nickname implying sycophancy to consultants. Without explanation or neutral framing, it introduces bias and unprofessionalism, especially in a piece otherwise attempting objective analysis.

4. **Overreliance on parentheses and dashes for core ideas:**  
   Several critical points (e.g., layoffs, cost-cutting, geographic misplacement) are buried in parentheses or em-dashes, weakening their impact and making the argument feel disjointed or evasive.

5. **Inconsistent register:**  
   The text shifts abruptly between analytical finance commentary ("squeeze profit from monopolies"), internet slang ("enshittification"), and personal confession ("why I live so frugally"). This undermines coherence and reader trust.

### **Other Significant Problems**

1. **Misuse of "enshittification" as a standalone term without definition:**  
   While popular in certain online circles, "product enshittification" is not widely recognized. Using it without explanation in a general audience text risks confusion or dismissal as unserious.

2. **Factual inaccuracy in "McKinsey Pichai":**  
   Sundar Pichai did not work at McKinsey. This is a false claim or baseless meme. Using it as a factual label is misleading and damages credibility.

3. **Ambiguous pronoun reference: "as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs..."**  
   "Their" could refer to META and GOOG, but then "GOOG mainly" contradicts that. The phrasing is confusing — better to say "particularly at Google" or restructure.

4. **Logical gap in investment rationale:**  
   The argument assumes monopolistic profit extraction is sustainable without innovation, but doesn't address how long such a strategy can last before market or technological disruption (e.g., AI startups, regulatory action) invalidates it. This weakens the analysis.

5. **Contradictory framing of personal ethics:**  
   The author claims not to trade due to "ideological concerns" about enabling "predatory capitalism," yet expresses admiration for the logic of cost-cutting and profit-squeezing. This creates a dissonance that isn't resolved, making the ethical stance appear performative or inconsistent.
