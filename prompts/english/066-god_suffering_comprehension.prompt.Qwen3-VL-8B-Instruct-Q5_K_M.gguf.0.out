1. The text argues that suffering and evil are not objective realities imposed by a distant God, but subjective experiences shaped by individual choices—both in perception and in how one engages with the world, including the illusion of agency and the power of belief.

2. I agree in spirit: suffering is often a product of perception, not pure fact. But I caution that dismissing suffering as “choice” risks minimizing trauma, systemic injustice, and biological pain—real experiences that cannot be wished away by belief alone.

3.  
God’s law, not a ghost,  
Creates all, and lets you choose your plot.  
You’re here by will, not fate,  
Suffering’s not a fact—it’s your state.  
Believe the tiger’s real?  
Or just a doll you’ve made to feel?  
You hold the lens, the light, the frame—  
The world’s a story you decide to name. [end of text]
