2. The sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is famous for containing every letter of the English alphabet at least once. This sentence is often used in typography and language learning to demonstrate the full range of letters in the alphabet.

3. Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who were building houses. The first pig built his house of straw, the second pig built his house of sticks, and the third pig built his house of bricks. A big, bad wolf came along and tried to knock down the houses of the three little pigs. The first pig's house was so flimsy that the wolf easily knocked it down, but the second pig's house was made of sticks and held up well against the wolf's attacks. The third pig's house was made of bricks and was the strongest of the three. The wolf couldn't break through the bricks, so he decided to cook the three little pigs for dinner. The first pig's mother heard the wolf's footsteps and saved him, but the second pig's mother was too late and the wolf ate him. The third pig's mother was able to save him and they all lived happily ever after.
