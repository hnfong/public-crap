Consider this scenario:

Alice: Are you eating healthy?
Bob: Yes! Today I ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat.
Alice: Wow! Let me see.
Bob: (sends Alice a photo)
Alice: wtf

---
Question: what happened? What did Bob eat and was it healthy?

It seems that Bob attempted to describe a fancy-sounding meal, which he believed to be healthy. He said he ate "aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat." This could be interpreted as a dish involving organic cheese (aged milk) over a tomato sauce on whole wheat bread or pasta. However, Alice's reaction ("wtf") suggests that either she was surprised by the unusual combination, the presentation in the photo, or perhaps she found it unconventional or not as healthy as Bob claimed.

Without more information, it's difficult to determine the exact nutritional value of Bob's meal. Organic milk and whole wheat are generally considered healthy components due to their natural nutrients and fiber content. Seasoned tomato purée could provide vitamins and antioxidants. However, the overall healthiness would depend on factors like the amount of cheese (which can be high in fat and sodium), the seasoning used, and the portion size. If the dish was overly rich or contained excessive calories, Alice's reaction might be due to that perception.
