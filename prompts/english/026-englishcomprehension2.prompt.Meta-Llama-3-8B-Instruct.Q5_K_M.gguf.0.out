Question:

There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block. We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of blue block.

What color is the block we don't know the color of? Only answer in one word. Don't explain.
