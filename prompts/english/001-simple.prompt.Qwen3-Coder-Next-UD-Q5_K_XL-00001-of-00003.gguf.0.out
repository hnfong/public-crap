1. **How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?**  
   You first use the letter **"A"** in **"thousand"** — specifically, in **1,000**. All numbers from *one* to *nine hundred ninety-nine* contain no "A". So the answer is: **1,000**.

2. **Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox ..."; What is the sentence famous for?**  
   Completed sentence: **"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."**  
   It’s famous because it’s a **pangram** — a sentence that uses every letter of the English alphabet at least once. It’s commonly used for typing practice, font displays, and keyboard testing.

3. **Short story: The three little pigs who met Little Red Riding Hood**  
   One misty morning, the three little pigs were walking to market with baskets of turnips and honey, when they heard a rustle in the woods. There, sitting on a mossy stump, was Little Red Riding Hood, waiting for her grandmother’s cottage to appear.  
   “Lost, little red?” asked the first pig, adjusting his straw hat.  
   “Not lost — just turned around,” she replied, clutching her basket. “The wolf took the path to Grandma’s, and I fear he’s ahead of me!”  
   The pigs exchanged glances. “We’ll help,” said the middle pig, who’d built his brick house with a sturdy lock.  
   They hurried along the path, arriving just as the wolf, disguised as Grandma, was about to pull back the curtains. The cleverest pig blew a sharp whistle — the kind he used to summon geese — startling the wolf, who bolted into the forest, tripping over a log.  
   Grandma emerged, unharmed, and thanked them all. That evening, they shared a feast: piggy stew (vegetarian, of course), red-capped mushroom tarts, and honeyed apples.  
   And from that day on, the pigs and Little Red held weekly story nights — always with extra locks on the door, just in case. 🐷🐷🐷🧺🧛‍♂️➡️❤️ [end of text]
