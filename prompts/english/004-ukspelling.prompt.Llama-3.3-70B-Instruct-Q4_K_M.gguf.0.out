I love the rainbows that appear in the sky after a spring shower. They are so colourful and bright! The sun shines through the raindrops, making a beautiful arc of colours - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple.

My favourite rainbows are the ones that appear over the hills and fields of the countryside. The green grass and flowers make a lovely backdrop for the rainbow's vibrant colours. Sometimes, you can even see a double rainbow, with a fainter arc of colour outside the main one.

I feel happy and lucky when I see a rainbow. It's like a special treat in the sky, just for me. I like to make a wish when I see a rainbow, and I always feel hopeful that my dream will come true. Rainbows are truly magical, and I never get tired of seeing them. [end of text]
