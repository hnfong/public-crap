1. The main thesis of the text is that suffering and evil in the world are subjective experiences chosen by individuals, as we create our own realities by selecting what and how we experience, and our belief in suffering is a personal choice rather than an objective reality.  
2. I disagree with the thesis. While subjective experience plays a role in how we perceive suffering, it dismisses the objective reality of systemic issues like poverty, disease, and violence that cause widespread suffering beyond individual choice.  
3.  
In God's creation, all is vast,  
Yet suffering we choose, we cast.  
Our qualia, a personal sight,  
Innocence or pain, day or night.  
To move or stay, we hold the key,  
The world we see, set by decree. [end of text]
