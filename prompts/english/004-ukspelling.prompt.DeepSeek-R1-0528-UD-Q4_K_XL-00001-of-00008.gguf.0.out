Okay, the user wants me to write a short story about rainbows for UK children, under 200 words, in UK English with simple words. 

Hmm, they specifically mentioned being a UK writer, so I need to make this feel authentically British. Maybe include familiar UK elements like wellies and puddles? 

The word limit is tight - 200 words means every sentence must count. Should focus on sensory details to make it vivid but simple. Kids love colours and textures, so describing the rainbow's appearance will be key. 

Ah, and it has to be the rainbow they "like most" - that's interesting. Not just any rainbow, but a special one. Maybe make it personal? A child's perspective would work well. 

Right, UK English check: "wellies" not "rain boots", "mum" not "mom". Keep sentences short for young readers. Avoid complex metaphors. 

The magic angle feels right - kids find wonder in ordinary things. That moment after rain when everything sparkles... yes. And ending with the rainbow fading keeps it realistic but still wistful. 

Word count... let me see. Draft feels about right. "Arched" might be advanced but it's visual. "Treasure" ties back to the gold idea simply. 

Final check: UK setting ✓, child's voice ✓, under 200 words ✓, simple vocabulary ✓. Hope they like the wellies detail - makes it feel squelchily British!

## My Favourite Rainbow

My favourite rainbow isn't the biggest or brightest. It’s the shy one that comes *after* the biggest, loudest storm.

You know the sort? When the grey clouds rumble away, grumbling, and the sun suddenly peeks out, all surprised. The air smells fresh and clean, like newly washed grass. Puddles shine like mirrors on the pavement.

Then, *there it is!* Not shouting, just gently painting itself across the still-damp sky. Seven soft stripes: red like my wellies, orange like a juicy squash, yellow like sunshine on buttercups, green like the park grass, blue like Mum's favourite mug, indigo like the deep evening sky before stars, violet like the flowers by Gran's gate.

It arches over the wet roofs and dripping trees, quiet and perfect. Like a secret gift just for looking up. It doesn't stay long. While I stand there, wellies squelching, it slowly fades, the colours melting back into the brightening blue.

But for those few magic minutes, it feels like the whole world took a deep breath and smiled. That’s my favourite rainbow. The quiet, happy one after the rain. (198 words) [end of text]
