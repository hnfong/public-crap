Here are my responses:

**1. Main thesis:**
The text argues that God creates everything, including suffering and evil, but these are not objective realities, rather subjective experiences chosen by individuals. Our experiences, including suffering, are a result of our own choices and perspectives. By acknowledging this, we can take responsibility for our experiences and change them if we desire.

**2. Agreement:**
I don't agree. While the text raises interesting points about the subjective nature of experience, it oversimplifies the complexity of suffering and evil, which can be caused by systemic injustices, circumstances beyond individual control, and inherent human vulnerabilities. The idea that individuals simply "choose" to experience suffering or evil can be dismissive of the very real pain and trauma that people face.

**3. Poem:**
In realms of mind, a choice we make,
To see the world, for our own sake.
Suffering and evil, a perspective's sway,
A subjective lens, that colors each day.

We choose to see, to feel, to know,
Our experiences, a reflection to show.
But can we truly say, we choose our fate?
Or are there forces, beyond our individual state?

The answer lies, in the heart's deep core,
A mix of choice, and circumstance's score.
Let's acknowledge, the complexity we face,
And approach each other, with empathy and grace. [end of text]
