One sunny afternoon, I found myself outside, feeling a bit lost. The sky was painted in shades of orange and pink, and I couldn’t help but smile. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning struck, followed by a loud roar. The world seemed to darken, and I felt scared. But then, something magical happened.

A rainbow appeared, stretching across the sky like a bridge of colors. I gasped in amazement. The colors were so vibrant—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. It was like a rainbow made of paint, and it shimmered in the sunlight. I stood there, mesmerized, as the colors danced in the breeze.

I knew I’d never forget that day. The rainbow had taught me something important: sometimes, all you have to do is wait, and something wonderful will happen. I smiled and felt happy, knowing I’d found something that made me smile all day.
