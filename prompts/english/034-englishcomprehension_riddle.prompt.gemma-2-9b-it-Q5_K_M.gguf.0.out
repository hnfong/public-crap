Consider this scenario:

Alice: Are you eating healthy?
Bob: Yes! Today I ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat.
Alice: Wow! Let me see.
Bob: (sends Alice a photo)
Alice: wtf

---
Question: what happened? What did Bob eat and was it healthy?

This scenario is humorous because Bob's description of his meal sounds incredibly strange and unappetizing. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Bob's description:**  "Aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat"  is a very unusual combination of ingredients. 
    * **Aged organic milk:**  While organic milk is generally healthier, "aged" milk isn't a common term. It might refer to a type of fermented milk, which could be healthy, but it's not something most people would eat plain.
    * **Seasoned tomato purée:**  Tomato purée is fine, but "seasoned" is vague. It could mean anything from a simple sprinkle of salt and pepper to a complex blend of spices.
    * **Baked whole wheat:** This is the most normal part of the meal, but it doesn't make the overall combination any less bizarre.

* **Alice's reaction:** "wtf" suggests that the photo Bob sent was even more unsettling than his description.  

**Was it healthy?**

It's impossible to say for sure without seeing the photo.  

* **Potentially healthy:** The ingredients themselves could be healthy: organic milk, tomatoes, and whole wheat. 
* **Potentially unhealthy:** The way they are combined might not be appetizing or even digestible.  

**The humor:**

The humor comes from the unexpected and strange combination of ingredients, the vagueness of Bob's description, and Alice's disgusted reaction. It plays on our expectations of what a healthy meal should look and taste like.
