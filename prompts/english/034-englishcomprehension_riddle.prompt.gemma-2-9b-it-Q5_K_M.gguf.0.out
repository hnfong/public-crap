This scenario is humorous because Bob's description of his meal sounds incredibly fancy and healthy, but the photo likely reveals something unexpected. 

Here's a breakdown:

* **Bob's description:**  He uses words like "aged organic milk," "seasoned tomato purée," and "baked whole wheat" to paint a picture of a gourmet, nutritious meal. 
* **Alice's reaction:** "wtf" suggests the photo shows something completely different from what Bob described. 

**Possible scenarios:**

* **The photo shows something messy or unappetizing:** Maybe the "aged organic milk" is curdled, the "seasoned tomato purée" is a blob, or the "baked whole wheat" is burnt.
* **The photo shows something completely different:** Perhaps Bob is holding a bowl of plain yogurt with a few tomatoes on top, or he's trying to pass off a simple sandwich as a gourmet creation.

**Was it healthy?**

It's impossible to say for sure based on the limited information.  

* **Potentially healthy:** The ingredients Bob mentions *could* be healthy. Aged organic milk, tomatoes, and whole wheat are all nutritious.
* **Potentially unhealthy:** The preparation method or the photo's contents could reveal unhealthy aspects. For example, if the "seasoned tomato purée" is loaded with sugar or salt, it wouldn't be as healthy.


The humor lies in the contrast between Bob's elaborate description and the likely reality revealed in the photo.
