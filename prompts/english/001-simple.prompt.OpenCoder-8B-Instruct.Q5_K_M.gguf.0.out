1. According to the standard English language spelling system, the number 1,000,000 would be spelled as "One million" and the number 1,000,000,000 would be spelled as "One billion". So, you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number after the number 999,999.

2. The sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is famous for being the first sentence used in the famous nursery rhyme "The Twelve Days of Christmas."

3. Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who lived in a little field. One day, they decided to go for a walk. They were walking along the road when they saw a little red riding hood sitting on a horse. The little pigs started to talk to each other and said, "We want to be like her, we want to ride on her horse." So they all got their tails and started to run after the little red riding hood. The little red riding hood was so happy that she gave them all a present. The little pigs were so happy that they all jumped up and ran away. That's how the three little pigs met the little red riding hood.
