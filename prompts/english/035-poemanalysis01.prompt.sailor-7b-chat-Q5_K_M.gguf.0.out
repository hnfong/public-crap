This is a commentary on the game "Super Mario 64" and the concept of inertia. The game is known for its challenging levels, and one of the most notorious is the level "Big Bowser's Castle," which features a series of platforms that move in different directions. The level is designed to test the player's ability to react quickly and adjust their movements accordingly. The phrase "inertia of running" refers to the tendency of a moving object to continue moving in the same direction, which can be a challenge when trying to adjust one's movements in a rapidly changing environment. The phrase "makes Mario slip" suggests that the player must be careful not to lose control of the character and fall into the abyss. The phrase "skill issue" implies that the level is difficult and requires a high level of skill to master. Overall, the commentary is a commentary on the challenges of the game and the importance of skill and precision in order to succeed. [end of text]
