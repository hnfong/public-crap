Bob ate a healthy meal consisting of aged organic milk, tomato purée spread, and baked whole wheat. The meal was not unhealthy, but it wasn't particularly healthy either. The ingredients were chosen to be healthy, but the preparation method (baking) might have added some calories and the spread might have contained some preservatives. The photo sent by Bob was not helpful in determining the meal's healthiness.
