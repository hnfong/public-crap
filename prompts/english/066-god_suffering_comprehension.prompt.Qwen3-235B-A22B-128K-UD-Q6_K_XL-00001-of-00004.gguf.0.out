### 1. **Main Thesis of the Text (in 3 sentences):**  
The text argues that God, as the creator of all things, is not a personal being but a universal force that supports all existence. Human suffering and evil are not contradictions to divine love but constructs of subjective experience — shaped by individual perception and choice. We are here because we chose to be, and our awareness of suffering reflects our own beliefs and perspectives, not an objective universal truth.

### 2. **Do you agree? (Concise response):**  
This perspective offers an interesting metaphysical framework, especially by redefining God as a universal mechanism rather than a person. While it's thought-provoking to consider suffering as a subjective construct, it may underestimate the objective reality of trauma and systemic injustice. I agree that perception shapes experience, but not entirely that suffering is solely a matter of personal choice.

### 3. **Short Rhyming Poem:**

We ask, “If God exists, why pain?”  
Yet truth may lie in lens, not stain.  
He made the whole, the vast, the wide—  
We choose the part we walk inside.  

A soul’s view is narrow, dim,  
Where love may wear a hollow grin.  
But step outside the cage of mind—  
The world you shape is yours to find. [end of text]
