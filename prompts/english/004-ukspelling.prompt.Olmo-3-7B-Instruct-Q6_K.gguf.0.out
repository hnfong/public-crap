I love the rainbows that appear after a heavy summer shower. As the rain stops, sunlight filters through the clouds, bouncing off water droplets. Where the light bends, colours dance in the sky: red first, then orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. My favourite part is the bright yellow in the middle, shining like a golden arc. I imagine I can touch it, and it feels warm and friendly. Rainbows remind me that even when life is grey, beauty can appear if we wait and look up. I always run inside to tell my little sister to look too – we both know it’s a sign that something wonderful just happened. [end of text]
