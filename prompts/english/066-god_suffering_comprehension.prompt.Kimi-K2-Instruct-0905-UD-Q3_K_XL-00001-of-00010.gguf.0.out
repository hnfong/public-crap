1. The text argues that an all-creating God generates every possibility, and what we call “suffering” is only a subjective experience we ourselves choose to perceive; by shifting belief or attention we could just as well choose otherwise.  
2. I disagree: while perception shapes experience, denying real pain erases victims and blocks the empathy needed to relieve it.  
3.  
God spun the world, then set it free;  
We pick the lens through which we see.  
Call pain a tale, a shadowed rhyme—  
Yet broken bones still ache in time. [end of text]
