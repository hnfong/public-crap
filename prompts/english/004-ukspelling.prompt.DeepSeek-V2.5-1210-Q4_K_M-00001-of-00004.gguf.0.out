**The Rainbow in the Meadow**

One sunny afternoon, after a heavy rain, I saw the most beautiful rainbow. It was in a meadow near my house. The grass was wet, and tiny drops of water sparkled like diamonds in the sunlight.

The rainbow stretched across the sky, starting near a big oak tree and ending by a little stream. It was so bright, with all the colours blending together perfectly. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet – they all danced in the sky like a magical bridge.

I liked this rainbow the most because it felt like it was just for me. I ran to the meadow, hoping to find the end of the rainbow, but it stayed just out of reach. The meadow smelled fresh, like wet grass and flowers, and the sound of the stream made everything feel peaceful.

As I stood there, the rainbow began to fade, but I didn’t mind. I knew it would come back again, and I would be ready to watch it shine. Rainbows are special because they remind us that even after the rain, there is always something beautiful waiting. [end of text]
