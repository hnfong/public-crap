The rainbows I like most come after a summer shower. The sky is still grey, but the sun peeks through and paints a bright arc over the park. The colours are soft and clear: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. I stand on the path and watch the arc touch the far hill. The air smells of wet grass and earth. My mum says, “Look, a rainbow!” and I smile. I like how it seems to rest on the trees and the roofs. It feels like a secret path that I could walk along, if I tried. When the rain stops and the sun is warm, the rainbow is my favourite thing. It makes the day feel new. [end of text]
