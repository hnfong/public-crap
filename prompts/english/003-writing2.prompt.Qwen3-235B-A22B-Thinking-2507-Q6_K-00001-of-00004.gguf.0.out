Okay, the user wants a very short story under 10 words about loss or grieving. That's quite a challenge! 

Hmm... they're probably testing how much emotional weight can be packed into minimal words. Maybe they're feeling melancholic themselves, or perhaps they're a writer experimenting with microfiction. 

I should avoid clich√©s like "died" or "funeral" since those feel too on-the-nose. The power here is in implication. Let me brainstorm: 

"Empty chair at dinner" - 4 words, shows absence through routine. 
"His coat still smells like rain" - 5 words, sensory grief. 
"Locked the door. Forgot he'd never come home." - 7 words, devastating realization. 

Wait, the last one has that gut-punch moment when routine clashes with reality. The locking action makes it active, not passive. And "forgot" implies this happens repeatedly - that's the real tragedy. 

*counts words* Yep, 7 words. Nails the brief. The user didn't specify tone, but this feels raw yet universal. Hope it resonates.
