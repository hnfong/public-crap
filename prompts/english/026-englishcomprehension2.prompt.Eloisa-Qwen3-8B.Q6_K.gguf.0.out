Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, initially, there are 3 black blocks on top of an unknown colored block, and beneath them is a blue block. So the order from top to bottom is: black, black, black, unknown, blue.

Then, they remove all the blocks and add one green block, so now there are 5 blocks in total: the original 4 (3 black, unknown, blue) plus the green one. They shuffle them and put them back on top of each other. Now, the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

Wait, the yellow block wasn't mentioned before. Did I miss something? Let me check the question again. Oh, the original setup didn't mention a yellow block. But after shuffling, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. So, the yellow block must be one of the blocks that was added or part of the original set? The original blocks were black, unknown, and blue. Then they added a green block. So the blocks are: black, black, black, unknown, blue, green. But the yellow block is mentioned after shuffling. That doesn't make sense unless the yellow block was part of the original or the green one is yellow? Wait, no, the green block is specified as green. So maybe there's a mistake here.

Wait, the question says: "We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of blue block."

So, the original blocks were 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue. Then they add a green block, making 5 blocks. But the yellow block is mentioned after shuffling. That implies that the yellow block is one of the blocks, but it wasn't in the original description. Unless the unknown block is yellow? Or maybe the blue block is yellow? Wait, no, the blue block is specified as blue.

This is confusing. Let me re-read the question carefully.

Original setup: 3 black blocks on top of an unknown block, beneath them a blue block. So the stack is: top to bottom: black, black, black, unknown, blue.

Then, remove all blocks and shuffle with one additional green block. So now there are 5 blocks: 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue, 1 green. They are shuffled and stacked again. Now, the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

But there's no yellow block in the list. Unless the unknown block is yellow. Or maybe the green block is yellow? But the question says "one additional green block," so it's green. So the yellow block must be the unknown block. Because the other blocks are black, blue, green. So the only one that could be yellow is the unknown one.

So, the unknown block is yellow. Therefore, the answer is yellow.

But let me make sure. The yellow block is on top of the blue block. So in the new stack, the block directly above the blue block is yellow. Since the blue block is part of the original, and the unknown block is one of the blocks, if the unknown is yellow, then when shuffled, it could end up on top of the blue block. The other blocks are black and green, which are different colors, so the yellow block (unknown) is the one that can be on top of blue.

Yes, that makes sense. So the unknown block is yellow.
