Here are the answers to your questions:

1. The letter "A" is used in the English language spelling of the number 1,000. Therefore, you would have to count to 1,000 before you would use the letter "A" in the spelling of a whole number.

2. The sentence "The quick brown fox" is famous because it is a pangram, a sentence that uses all the letters of the alphabet at least once. The complete sentence is: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." This sentence is often used as a demonstration of a font or keyboard's capabilities, as it contains all 26 letters of the alphabet.

3. Here's a short story about the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood:

Once upon a time, the three little pigs were out for a stroll in the forest when they stumbled upon Little Red Riding Hood on her way to visit her grandmother. The pigs, whose names were Percy, Paisley, and Pascal, were curious about the little girl in the red hood and her basket of goodies.

"Where are you headed in such a hurry?" asked Percy, the first little pig.

"I'm on my way to visit my grandmother," replied Little Red Riding Hood. "She's not feeling well and I'm bringing her some fresh bread and jam."

The pigs' ears perked up at the mention of food, and they asked if they could join Little Red Riding Hood on her visit. She agreed, and the four of them set off together.

As they walked, they encountered the Big Bad Wolf, who was lurking in the shadows. "Ah ha!" he exclaimed, spotting the group. "A delicious little pig and a plump little girl, all in one place!"

But the three little pigs were not afraid. They stood up to the wolf and chased him away with a loud "Oink! Oink!" Little Red Riding Hood was impressed by their bravery and thanked them for their help.

When they arrived at Grandmother's house, they found her in a bit of a pickle. The wolf had been there before them and had eaten all her porridge, but the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood were able to help her clean up the mess and make a new batch of porridge.

From that day on, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became great friends and had many more adventures together. [end of text]
