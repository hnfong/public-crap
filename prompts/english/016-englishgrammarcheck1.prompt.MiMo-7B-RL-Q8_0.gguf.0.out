Alright, let's take a look at this text. The user wants me to find grammar mistakes, especially tense and agreement issues, as well as serious stylistic problems. They mentioned not to report minor stylistic or sentence structure issues, so I need to focus on the more critical ones.

Starting with the first paragraph: "So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..." The phrase "basically saying" seems a bit informal. Maybe "alleging" or "claiming" would be better. But is that a grammar issue? Maybe not. Wait, "Andreessen Horowitz" is a company name, so it should be capitalized. The user wrote it as "Andreessen Horowitz" which is correct since it's a proper noun. Wait, actually, in the text, it's written as "Andreessen Horowitz" with a capital A. That's correct because it's the name of the venture capital firm. So no issue there.

Next sentence: "And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective." The phrase "he's probably onto something" uses "he" which refers to Andreessen Horowitz? Wait, the subject is "he," but Andreessen Horowitz is a company, so maybe it should be "they" or "the company." That's a pronoun antecedent agreement issue. The antecedent is Andreessen Horowitz (the company), so using "he" is incorrect. It should be "they're probably onto something."

Then, "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional..." The em dash here might be better as a comma. But is that a grammar issue? Maybe not. The sentence structure is a bit complex, but the main issue is the use of "don't seem to be capable" versus "are not capable." The contraction "don't" is used here, which is correct in informal contexts, but the rest of the text seems a bit more formal. Maybe not a major issue. However, the use of "their monopolies" refers to the companies (META and GOOG), which is correct.

Looking at "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG...". The em dash is used correctly here to set off the explanation. But maybe a comma would suffice. However, the user said not to report minor stylistic issues, so perhaps that's okay.

Next part: "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." The parenthetical "(GOOG mainly)" is correctly placed. However, "McKinsey Pichai" – Andy Rubin is the CEO of Google, but maybe the user meant Sundar Pichai? Wait, Google's CEO is Sundar Pichai. The user wrote "McKinsey Pichai," which might be a mistake. McKinsey is a consulting firm, so perhaps it's a typo. The correct name is Sundar Pichai. So that's a factual error, but the user might be referring to the CEO's name. Alternatively, maybe they meant McKinsey & Company, but that's not a person. So this is an error in proper noun. But the user asked for grammar and style issues, not factual accuracy. Hmm. Maybe it's a typo for "Sundar Pichai." If that's the case, it's a mistake in the name. But since the user wrote "McKinsey Pichai," perhaps they intended to refer to a person, but it's incorrect. So that's a factual error, but maybe the user is aware of that. Alternatively, maybe it's a misattribution. Anyway, that's a possible issue.

In the same sentence: "McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." The use of "is" might be incorrect if referring to a collective, but Pichai is a person, so "is" is correct. But if "McKinsey Pichai" was intended to be a company, then it's wrong. But perhaps the user meant to refer to the CEO, so "is" is correct. However, the name is incorrect. So that's a factual error, but maybe not a grammar issue. The user might have intended to refer to Sundar Pichai, the actual CEO. So that's a mistake in the name.

Moving on: "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations." The phrase "no ounce of doubt" is correct, but "they can" refers to the companies (GOOG and META), so "they" is correct here. However, earlier the analysis was about GOOG specifically, so maybe "it" (referring to GOOG). But "they" is acceptable if referring to both companies. However, there might be a better antecedent. But maybe that's a minor issue. The main thing is the use of "they" correctly. So perhaps no problem here.

Next paragraph: "With interest rates still held 'high', the free money is draining away..." The use of the single quote around 'high' might be better as double quotes or no quotes if it's an adjective. But in the middle of a sentence, using single quotes is acceptable in some styles, but maybe the user should use double quotes. However, the user might be following a specific style guide. Not sure if that's a major issue. The main thing is the comma before 'high'? Wait, the sentence is: "With interest rates still held 'high', the free money is draining away..." The structure is correct. The em dash or comma is used correctly here.

Then: "the promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech)" The phrase "is operationally much smaller than general tech" – "general tech" is vague, but maybe that's the point. However, "AI" is compared to general tech. The use of "is" here is correct. But "operationally much smaller" – maybe "operatively" is better, but that's a style choice. The main issue is the use of "is" which is correct. So perhaps no grammar issue here.

Next: "This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium..." The use of "cuts/stagnation" as a compound verb might be a bit informal. Maybe "layoffs and wage cuts, along with stagnation," but again, the user might be okay with that. Not sure if that's a major issue. The main thing is the use of "reaches equilibrium" – which is correct.

"product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard." The term "enshittification" is correctly spelled, but the use of "slams down hard" is informal. Maybe "cracks down hard" is better, but that's stylistic. The user might be aware of that.

"Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase..." The contraction "knows" is incorrect here. The sentence should be "Those who read history know..." because "knows" is third person singular, but the subject is "Those who read history," which is plural. So "know" is correct. That's a verb agreement error. The user wrote "knows" which is incorrect; it should be "know."

Another error: "the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial 'efficiency'." The use of "is taking over" is correct, but maybe "takes over" would be better if the subject is the engine. However, "is taking over" is correct in present tense. So no issue there.

"In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." The phrase "In America We Trust" is written as a title, but in the middle of a sentence. Maybe it should be in quotes or capitalized differently. However, the main issue is the contraction "they're" which is correct in informal contexts. But the sentence structure: "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough..." – perhaps it should be "In America, we trust that they're capitalist enough..." But the user might be using a different style. The main issue is the use of "they're" which is correct. However, the phrase "In America We Trust" is written without quotes or italics, which might be a stylistic issue. But again, the user might be aware of that.

"the party's gonna end sooner or later." The contraction "gonna" is informal, which might be a style issue depending on the context. The rest of the text seems to have a mix of formal and informal language. Maybe in this context, it's acceptable.

"People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like..." The phrase "expectation what their careers" is incorrect. It should be "expectation of what their careers..." The use of "what" after "expectation" is wrong; it should be "of". That's a preposition error. So "expectation of" is correct. The user wrote "expectation what," which is a grammar mistake.

"Saving up for 'FI' isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry..." The use of "FI" in quotes is okay, but maybe it's better to spell it out as "financial independence" for clarity. However, the user might be using it as an abbreviation, which is acceptable in context.

"My technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances)." The phrase "we're still sane though" is informal. Maybe "we're still reasonable" or something, but that's stylistic. The main issue is the use of "we're" referring to the author, which is correct.

Looking for tense issues: Let's check the entire text for consistent tense. The first paragraph uses present tense: "are not doing enough real work," "can't help but agree," "probably onto something," etc. Then in the analysis part: "My analysis back then was exactly..." – "was" uses past tense. But the narrative is in present tense? Wait, the first paragraph is present tense, then the analysis is in past tense. Let me check:

First paragraph: present tense.

Then: "My analysis back then was exactly..." – "was" is past tense. But the user is talking about a past event (last year), so past tense is correct. Then in the next sentence: "they can cut costs by almost half" – present tense. Then "as we've seen with their... layoffs in early 2023" – past tense reference. Then "McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready" – present tense. But if the layoffs were in 2023, then using present tense for "is ready" might be a problem because the layoffs are a past event. Wait, the sentence is: "as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready..." That seems like the description of the past event, so "was ready" would be correct. But the user wrote "is ready," which is present tense. That's a tense error. The correct verb should be "was ready" because the layoffs happened in 2023, which is in the past. So using "is" here is incorrect. That's a tense mistake.

Another tense issue: "the promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech)" – "gone" is past participle, but the sentence is in present tense. "Gone" should be "gone" as an adjective, but in this context, it's used as a past participle. Wait, the phrase is "promises... largely gone" – "gone" here is an adjective meaning eliminated, which is correct. So no tense issue there.

Looking at "the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial 'efficiency'." The present tense is correct here as it's describing the current state.

Another possible tense issue: "I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid." The conditional "would have hated" is correct for past perfect, but the context is reflecting on a past action. So that's okay.

So summarizing the tense issues:

1. In the sentence starting with "as we've seen with their... layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready..." The verb "is" should be "was" to match the past time of the layoffs.

2. The phrase "the promises of revolutionary tech largely gone" – "gone" is correct as an adjective here.

Another tense issue: "the free money is draining away" – present tense, which is correct.

Another possible issue: "they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations." Present tense, correct.

So the main tense error is the use of "is" instead of "was" in the sentence about the layoffs.

Agreement issues:

1. In the first paragraph: "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something." The antecedent for "he" is Andreessen Horowitz (the company), which is plural. So "they're probably onto something." So "he" is incorrect; should be "they" or "the company."

2. In the sentence: "the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium." The subject is "labor supply/demand," which is plural (supply and demand are both plural), so the verb should be "reaches" (singular) or "reach" (plural). Wait, "labor supply/demand" – "supply" is singular, "demand" is singular. So the verb should be "reaches" because it's referring to both supply and demand collectively. Wait, "supply" and "demand" are both singular nouns, so "labor supply/demand" would have two singular nouns, making the verb "reaches." But actually, "supply" and "demand" are both singular, so the verb should agree with the subject. However, when connected by "and," the verb usually agrees with the first subject. But in this case, it's "labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium." Maybe it's better to write "labor supply and demand reach equilibrium," using "reach" to match the plural subjects. So the original sentence has "reaches," which is incorrect because "supply" and "demand" are both singular, but when combined, the subject is plural. Wait, actually, "supply" and "demand" are both singular, so "labor supply/demand" is two singular nouns, making the compound subject. But when written as "labor supply and demand," it's two singular nouns connected by "and," so the verb should be plural: "reach." So the original sentence uses "reaches," which is incorrect. That's a subject-verb agreement error.

3. In the sentence: "the promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech)" – "is" vs. "are." The relative clause "which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech" refers to AI. Since AI is singular, "is" is correct. So no issue there.

4. In the sentence: "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers..." – as mentioned earlier, "expectation what" should be "expectation of."

Stylistic issues:

1. Use of "they're" in "they're capitalist enough" – perhaps "their" instead, but "they're" is correct as a contraction of "they are." Wait, "they're" is "they are," but the sentence is "they're capitalist enough," which would be "they are capitalist enough." That's not correct. The phrase should be "they are capitalist enough," but the contraction "they're" would imply "they are capitalist enough," which is not correct. Wait, the actual phrase is: "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." The intended meaning is "In America, we trust that they (the companies) are capitalist enough..." So "they're" is a contraction of "they are," but in this context, it should be "their" (possessive). Wait, no. The sentence is: "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." The structure is "We Trust [that] they're capitalist enough..." where "they're" is "they are." So the sentence should be "In America, we trust that they are capitalist enough..." Using "they're" is incorrect here because it's a contraction for "they are," but in the context of a belief ("We Trust"), it should be "that they are." So the use of "they're" is incorrect; it should be "they are." That's a grammar mistake.

Another stylistic issue: "the free money is draining away" – "draining away" is a bit informal. Maybe "drying up" would be better, but that's stylistic.

Use of "gonna" in "the party's gonna end" – informal.

The phrase "we're still sane though, just unique circumstances" – "we're" is informal.

Use of "FI" in quotes – maybe spell out "financial independence" for clarity.

Another stylistic issue: The text is quite long and has a lot of complex sentences. Maybe breaking them up would improve readability, but the user said not to report minor stylistic issues.

Now, compiling all the issues:

Grammar mistakes (tense and agreement):

1. "he's probably onto something" → should be "they're probably onto something" (pronoun antecedent agreement).

2. "McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready" → "was definitely ready" (tense error referring to past event).

3. "the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium" → should be "reach" (subject-verb agreement; "supply" and "demand" are both singular, but when combined, the verb should be plural if written as "supply and demand," but in the original text, it's written as "supply/demand," which is a compound subject. However, standard English would use "reach" for plural subjects. So the verb should be "reach."

4. "the expectation what their careers" → "expectation of their careers" (preposition error).

5. "they're capitalist enough" → "they are capitalist enough" (contraction error; should be "they are" not "they're").

Stylistic issues:

1. Use of informal language (e.g., "gonna," "we're," "they're").

2. "FI" as an abbreviation; perhaps spell out.

3. "they're" used incorrectly as a contraction instead of "they are."

4. "enshittification" spelled correctly, but the term is informal.

5. Complex sentences that could be simplified for readability (though the user said not to report minor stylistic issues, so maybe this is okay).

Other possible issues: The mention of "levels.fyi" – perhaps a reference to a website, but the user wrote it as "levels.fyi" with a dotfy extension, which might be a typo. Should it be "levels.fyi"? Or maybe "levels.fyi" is correct. But that's a factual/typosical error, not grammar. The user might be referring to a real site, so maybe it's okay.

Also, "GOOG mainly" in parentheses – perhaps better to say "especially GOOG" for clarity.

But the user asked for at least 5 issues in each category. Let's see:

Grammar (tense and agreement):

1. Pronoun antecedent agreement: "he's" → "they're".

2. Tense error: "is ready" → "was ready".

3. Subject-verb agreement: "reaches" → "reach".

4. Preposition error: "expectation what" → "expectation of".

5. Contraction error: "they're" → "they are".

Stylistic issues:

1. Use of informal contractions ("they're", "gonna", "we're").

2. Use of "FI" as an abbreviation.

3. Incorrect use of "they're" instead of "they are".

4. Use of "they're" in a formal context.

5. Use of "enshittification" as a term (maybe too informal or neologistic).

Wait, but some of these might overlap. Let me make sure each point is distinct.

Alternatively, for stylistic issues:

1. Informal language ("gonna", "we're", "they're").

2. Use of "they're" as a contraction where "they are" is needed.

3. Use of "FI" without full spelling.

4. Use of "they're" in a sentence that requires the full form.

5. Use of complex sentences (but the user said not to report minor issues, so maybe not).

Alternatively, maybe the use of "they're" in the sentence "they're capitalist enough" is incorrect because it should be "their" (possessive). Wait, the sentence is: "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." The structure is "We Trust [that] they're capitalist enough..." where "they're" is "they are." So it should be "they are capitalist enough," not "they're." So the contraction is incorrect here. The correct phrase should be "they are capitalist enough," not "they're capitalist enough." So that's a grammar mistake because the contraction is used in the wrong context.

Another possible issue: "the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium." If written as "supply/demand," it's a compound subject, but standard English would use "supply and demand," requiring "reach." So the verb should be plural. So "reach" instead of "reaches."

So compiling the list:

Grammar (tense and agreement):

1. "he's probably onto something" → "they're probably onto something" (pronoun antecedent agreement).

2. "is definitely ready" → "was definitely ready" (tense error for past event).

3. "reaches equilibrium" → "reach equilibrium" (subject-verb agreement with plural subjects).

4. "expectation what" → "expectation of" (preposition error).

5. "they're capitalist enough" → "they are capitalist enough" (contraction error).

Stylistic issues:

1. Use of informal contractions ("they're", "gonna", "we're").

2. Use of "FI" as an abbreviation instead of spelling out "financial independence."

3. Use of "they're" in a sentence where the full form "they are" is required.

4. Use of "enshittification" which is an informal term.

5. The phrase "the party's gonna end" using informal language.

Wait, but some of these are overlapping. Maybe the main stylistic issues are the informal language and the use of contractions where more formal language is expected. Also, the use of "they're" incorrectly.

Another possible stylistic issue: The text is quite informal in tone, which might not be the desired style for a formal essay or article. But the user might be aware of that.

Another issue: The sentence starting with "With interest rates still held 'high', the free money is draining away..." uses single quotes around 'high', which might be better as double quotes or no quotes, depending on style. But this is minor.

Another possible issue: The use of "GOOG mainly" in parentheses. It might be better to say "especially GOOG" for clarity.

But the user asked for at least 5 issues in each category. Let's make sure to list five for grammar and five for style.

Grammar:

1. Pronoun antecedent agreement: "he's" → "they're".

2. Tense error: "is ready" → "was ready".

3. Subject-verb agreement: "reaches" → "reach".

4. Preposition error: "expectation what" → "expectation of".

5. Contraction error: "they're" → "they are".

Stylistic:

1. Use of informal contractions in formal contexts.

2. Use of "FI" without full spelling.

3. Use of "they're" where "they are" is needed.

4. Use of informal language ("gonna", "we're").

5. Use of "enshittification" as an informal term.

That's five each. Now, check if there are more.

Another grammar issue: In the sentence "the promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech)", the relative clause "which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech" uses "is" correctly because AI is singular. So no issue.

Another possible issue: "the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over" – "engine" is singular, so "is" is correct. No problem.

Another possible tense issue: "My analysis back then was exactly..." – past tense is correct because it refers to a past analysis.

Another possible issue: "they can cut costs by almost half" – present tense, correct.

So the main ones are the five listed above.

Now, to present the answer as per the user's request: list the grammar and stylistic issues, each with at least five points.

Make sure to avoid minor issues like sentence structure or punctuation (unless it's a major error). For example, the use of em dashes is acceptable, but the user might have used them correctly.

Also, check for other agreement issues. For example, in the sentence: "the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium." If "supply/demand" is treated as a single noun (e.g., "labor supply-demand"), then the verb would be singular. But in standard English, "supply and demand" are two nouns connected by "and," requiring a plural verb. So the correct sentence should be "the labor supply and demand reach equilibrium." So the original uses "reaches," which is incorrect. That's a subject-verb agreement error.

Another possible issue: "the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking)" – the relative clause "who..." correctly refers to the tech workers, so no issue.

Another possible issue: "the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough..." – the use of "but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough" – the structure is awkward. Maybe "but in America, we trust that they're capitalist enough." The original uses "In America We Trust" as a title-like phrase, which might be better as "In America, we trust that they're..." but that's stylistic. However, the contraction "they're" is incorrect here as discussed.

So the five grammar issues are as listed above.

Stylistic issues include the use of informal language, incorrect contractions, abbreviations, and perhaps the use of "they're" where "they are" is needed.

Now, to present the answer in a list format, as per the user's request.
</think>

**Grammar Mistakes (Tense/Agreement):**  
1. **Pronoun Antecedent Agreement**: "he's probably onto something" (referring to Andreessen Horowitz, a company; should be "they're").  
2. **Tense Error**: "McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready" (describes a past event in 2023; should be "was ready").  
3. **Subject-Verb Agreement**: "the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium" (supply/demand are plural; should be "reach").  
4. **Preposition Error**: "expectation what their careers" (should be "expectation *of* their careers").  
5. **Contraction Error**: "they're capitalist enough" (incorrect use of "they're"; should be "they are").  

**Stylistic Issues:**  
1. **Informal Contractions**: Overuse of "they're," "gonna," and "we're" in a mixally formal tone.  
2. **Abbreviation**: Using "FI" in quotes without spelling out "financial independence" for clarity.  
3. **Awkward Phrasing**: "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough" (unclear and grammatically incorrect; better phrased as "we trust that they are").  
4. **Overuse of Informal Terms**: "Enshtittification" (neologism) and "operationally much smaller than general tech" (unprofessional jargon).  
5. **Unnecessary Parentheticals**: Redundant phrases like "(we're still sane though, just unique circumstances)" that disrupt flow.  

**Other Notable Issues**:  
- **Proper Noun Error**: "McKinsey Pichai" is incorrect; refers to Sundar Pichai (Google’s CEO).  
- **Ambiguous References**: "their monopolies" (unclear which company’s monopoly is being discussed).  
- **Tense Inconsistency**: Mixed use of past ("My analysis back then was") and present tense ("is taking over") in the same paragraph. [end of text]
