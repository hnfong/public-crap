Okay, I have reviewed the provided text and identified the following grammatical errors and stylistic issues:

*   **Tense:** The use of "so" is incorrect. The correct tense is "Therefore."
*   **"Agreement":** The phrase "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something" is grammatically correct but slightly awkward.
*   **"Agreement":** The phrase "In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG" is grammatically correct but slightly awkward.
*   **"Agreement":** The phrase "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic" is grammatically correct but slightly awkward.
*   **"Agreement":** The phrase "While META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down" is grammatically correct but slightly awkward.
*   **"Agreement":** The phrase "That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations." is grammatically correct but slightly awkward.
*   **"Agreement":** The phrase "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." is grammatically correct but slightly awkward.
*   **"Agreement":** The phrase "In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid." is grammatically correct but slightly awkward.
*   **"Agreement":** The phrase "The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." is grammatically correct but slightly awkward.
*   **"Agreement":** The phrase "There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift." is grammatically correct but slightly awkward.
*   **"Agreement":** The phrase "With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency". This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard." is grammatically correct but slightly awkward.
*   **"Agreement":** The phrase "Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another." is grammatically correct but slightly awkward.
*   **"Agreement":** The phrase "Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride." is grammatically correct but slightly awkward.
*   **"Agreement":** The phrase "That but it has been a fun ride." is grammatically correct but slightly awkward.
