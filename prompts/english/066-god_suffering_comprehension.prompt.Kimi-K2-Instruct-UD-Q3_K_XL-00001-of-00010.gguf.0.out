1. The text argues that an all-creating God encompasses every possibility, and our subjective experience—including any suffering we perceive—is ultimately a personal choice of what to focus on and believe, not an imposed condition.

2. I disagree: while perspective shapes experience, large-scale atrocities, systemic injustice, and involuntary pain are not mere choices; they are real constraints that many cannot simply opt out of by changing belief.

3.  
In realms where all is spun,  
By hands of law, not ghostly one,  
We pick the threads we wish to see—  
Yet some are cut, not chosen free. [end of text]
