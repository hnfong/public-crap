1. **How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?**  
   You would have to count to **"eleven"** because the first time the letter "A" appears in the English spelling of a whole number is in "eleven."

2. **Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox ..."; What is the sentence famous for?**  
   The sentence is: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."  
   This sentence is famous for being a pangram, meaning it contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once.

3. **Write a short a story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.**  
   Once upon a time, there were three little pigs: a clever red pig, a lazy gray pig, and a timid black pig. They lived in a house with a big door that could not be opened by any of them. One day, a little red riding hood came to their house with a basket of bread. She asked the pigs to share the bread. The red pig was too greedy and ate most of it, leaving little for the others. The gray pig was lazy and ate all the remaining bread, leaving nothing for the black pig. The black pig, being the most timid, did not eat any bread and instead asked the red riding hood for help. She brought a big axe and cut down the big door, allowing the three pigs to escape. From that day on, they lived happily ever after, teaching them the importance of sharing and being kind.
