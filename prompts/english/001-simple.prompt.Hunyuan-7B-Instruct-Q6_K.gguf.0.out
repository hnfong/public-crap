   Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who lived in a house. They were very different from each other. The first little pig was a tall, skinny pig who loved to eat carrots. The second little pig was a medium-sized pig who loved to eat grass. The third little pig was a short, stout pig who loved to eat both carrots and grass.  

   One day, a little red riding hood came to the house with a big basket of apples. The pigs were very excited. The tall pig wanted to eat the apples first, but the medium pig said, "Let's share." The short pig agreed.  

   The red riding hood carried the apples to the house, and the three pigs shared them happily. From that day on, they worked together to build a strong house and lived a happy life.
