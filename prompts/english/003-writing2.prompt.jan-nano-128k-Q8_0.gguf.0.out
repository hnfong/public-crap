Okay, the user wants a story under 10 words about loss or grieving. Let me think. First, I need to capture the essence of grief in a very concise way. Maybe start with a strong image. "She held the empty chair..." That shows absence. Then add something about the memory. "where he used to sit." Now, the emotion. "The silence echoed his name." Wait, that's 10 words. Let me check: "She held the empty chair where he used to sit. The silence echoed his name." Exactly 10 words. Does that convey loss and grieving? Yes, the empty chair represents his absence, the silence symbolizes the ongoing grief, and echoing his name shows the lingering memory. It's simple but evocative. Maybe that's it.

"Her hands trembled, clutching the empty chair. The silence echoed his name." [end of text]
