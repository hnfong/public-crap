Here are the issues I found in the text:

**Grammar Mistakes:**

1. "I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking" should be "I'm sure that most tech workers are mostly diligent and hardworking" (subject-verb agreement error)
2. "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations" should be "I had no doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day-to-day operations" (verb tense consistency)
3. "I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude" should be "I didn't make any trades, only because I would have hated how I would have participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude" (verb tense consistency)
4. "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose" should be "In America, we trust that they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose" (subject-verb agreement error and lack of parallel structure)
5. "I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years" should be "I'm not sure I can accurately predict what Google will be like in 15 years" (subject-verb agreement error)

**Tense Issues:**

1. The text switches between past tense (e.g. "back when tech stocks were down last year") and present tense (e.g. "the party's gonna end sooner or later") without clear indication of when the events are taking place.
2. The text uses the phrase "I had no ounce of doubt" which implies a past tense, but is used to describe a current situation.
3. The text uses the phrase "I'm sure" which is a present tense expression, but is used to describe a past situation.

**Agreement Issues:**

1. "people in big tech companies" should be "tech workers in big tech companies" (subject-verb agreement error)
2. "I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking" should be "most tech workers are mostly diligent and hardworking" (subject-verb agreement error)
3. "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day-to-day operations" should be "I had no doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day-to-day operations" (subject-verb agreement error)
4. "I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude" should be "I didn't make any trades, only because I would have hated how I would have participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude" (subject-verb agreement error)
5. "I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years" should be "I'm not sure I can accurately predict what Google will be like in 15 years" (subject-verb agreement error)

**Serious Stylistic Issues:**

1. The text uses a mix of informal and formal language, which can make it difficult to follow.
2. The text uses a lot of colloquial expressions and slang (e.g. "frugally", "geographically misplaced", "we're still sane though") that may not be familiar to all readers.
3. The text uses a lot of complex sentences with multiple clauses, which can make it difficult to follow.
4. The text uses a lot of rhetorical questions (e.g. "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose") that can come across as confrontational or argumentative.
5. The text uses a lot of hyperbole (e.g. "the party's gonna end sooner or later") that can be seen as exaggerated or melodramatic.

**Other Problems:**

1. The text lacks a clear thesis statement or main argument.
2. The text jumps abruptly from discussing the topic of tech companies and their business practices to discussing the author's personal financial situation and goals.
3. The text uses a lot of vague terms (e.g. "predatory capitalist attitude", "golden goose") that are not clearly defined.
4. The text uses a lot of jargon and technical terms (e.g. "antitrust", "FI") that may not be familiar to non-experts.
5. The text lacks a clear conclusion or summary of the main points. [end of text]
