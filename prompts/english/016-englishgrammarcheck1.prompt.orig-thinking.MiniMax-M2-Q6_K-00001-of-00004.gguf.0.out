I need to review the text for grammar mistakes, focusing on tense and agreement issues, as well as serious stylistic problems. The user wants at least five issues in each category, so I’ll create a list. I’ll avoid minor stylistic issues and concentrate on significant errors. I’ll also ensure to use Markdown headings for clarity. The text contains several grammar mistakes, like subject-verb agreement errors and tense inconsistencies, which I’ll highlight.

I need to identify several grammar mistakes in the text. For example, "McKinsey Pichai" is incorrect; it should be "Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google." Also, "In America We Trust" is a capitalization error; it should be "In America, we trust." 

I’ll note that "people who read history knows" should be "people who read history know." Additionally, "the party's gonna end" is informal and should be "the party is going to end." Lastly, "the only risk is basically regulatory" is awkward and should be revised for clarity.

I need to identify more grammar and stylistic issues in the text. For example, "the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial 'efficiency'" is vague and could be improved. 

I’ll also note that "Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance" is awkward and should be revised. Additionally, "the logic is solid" is too informal, and "the only risk is basically regulatory" is vague. 

I’ll ensure to highlight at least five issues in each category, focusing on grammar and style.
