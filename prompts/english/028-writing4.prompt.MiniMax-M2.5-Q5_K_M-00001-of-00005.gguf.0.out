Everybody called her Aspirin -- she always looked like she was aspiring to become a special state of being, and just looking at her made your headache go away.

She moved through the corridors of St. Bartholomew's like a cool hand on a feverish forehead, appearing exactly when the chaos peaked and vanishing when the crisis passed. The nurses swore she wasn't on the schedule. The doctors swore they'd never hired her. But there she was, always — steady, pale, impossibly calm — pressing a cup of water into the hands of a trembling patient or simply standing at the foot of a bed, saying nothing, until the monitors steadied.

I first saw her in the ICU, the night my father was dying.

He'd been fading for weeks — the cancer had spread to everywhere it wasn't supposed to, and the machines were doing the breathing he no longer could. My mother was asleep in the chair beside his bed, her hand still holding his, and I was sitting in the hallway, trying to figure out how to tell a twelve-year-old that his grandfather wasn't coming home.

That's when she appeared.

She was wearing a white dress that didn't look like a uniform, and her hair was the color of aspirin tablets — pale, almost translucent. She didn't say anything. She just sat down next to me, and the noise in my head — the static, the terror, the desperate bargaining with a God I wasn't sure I believed in — it all just... stopped. Like someone had turned off a television in another room.

"You don't have to be strong," she said. Her voice was like a pill sliding down a throat — smooth and inevitable. "You don't have to understand. You just have to stay."

My father died three hours later. But I remember those three hours differently than I should. I remember them as quiet. I remember my mother waking up and crying, but gently, like rain. I remember my brother arriving in time to say goodbye, though he'd been stuck in traffic for an hour and should have never made it.

I remember her — Aspirin — standing by the window, watching the first light come in, and then she was gone.

After that, I started seeing her everywhere.

At the bus station, when a man was having a seizure and the crowd was panicking, she was there, guiding people back, telling them to give space, to breathe. At the grocery store, when a woman's card kept declining and she was trying not to cry in front of her kids, Aspirin appeared from nowhere and paid the bill. At the park, when a dog knocked over a toddler and the parents were screaming, she was there, lifting the child up, checking for bumps, smiling in that way that made you feel like everything was going to be fine.

No one knew her name. No one knew where she came from. She didn't have a locker at the hospital, or a car in the lot, or a face in the employee directory. But she had something else — she had that quality, that impossible, intangible thing, like the first sip of water after a long thirst, like the moment the pressure in your sinuses finally releases.

People started calling her Aspirin, because that's what she felt like. Not a cure. Not a solution. Just... relief.

I became a doctor because of her.

I wanted to understand what she was. I spent years studying neurology, psychology, parapsychology — anything that might explain how a woman I'd never seen before could walk into the worst moments of my life and make them bearable. I interviewed hundreds of people who claimed to have seen her. A hospice nurse in Seattle. A paramedic in Chicago. A teenager in São Paulo who said she'd shown up at his school right before a shooting, talked him down from the roof, and then vanished.

The stories were always the same: calm in the middle of chaos, a face you couldn't quite remember, and the sudden, inexplicable sense that everything was going to be okay.

I never found her.

Until last Tuesday.

I was working the night shift at the hospital — same ward, same floor, same corridor where my father had taken his last breaths — when the code blue came in. Room 414. Cardiac arrest. I ran.

The patient was a woman in her sixties, the kind of thin that comes from illness, not age. Her husband was in the hallway, crying in that way that men cry when they've forgotten how — ugly, helpless, like a child. The nurses were working fast, the defibrillator was charging, and I was pushing through to check the monitors when I saw her.

Aspirin.

She was standing in the corner of the room, by the window, wearing that same white dress. She wasn't doing anything. She wasn't touching the patient or speaking to the staff. She was just... there. Watching. Her eyes met mine, and for the first time in twenty years, I felt that static in my head go quiet.

"You came back," I whispered.

She smiled. "I never left."

The woman's heart started beating. Not on its own — the doctors did it, the machines did it, the years of training and science did it. But I saw Aspirin nod, just once, and then she was gone.

The husband thanked me, crying, grabbing my hands. "She smiled at me," he said. "Right before she came back. I saw her smile."

I didn't tell him about the woman in the corner. I didn't tell him I'd been seeing her for twenty years. I just squeezed his hand and said what she would have said.

"You don't have to be strong. You don't have to understand. You just have to stay."

---

I don't know what she is. I used to think she was a ghost, or an angel, or some kind of collective hallucination brought on by stress and grief. But now I think she's something simpler. I think she's what we all become, if we stay long enough. I think she's the version of us that shows up when someone else is suffering — the calm in the storm, the steady hand, the voice that says *it's going to be okay* and actually makes you believe it.

Maybe she's not a person. Maybe she's a promise.

Or maybe — and this is the theory I like best — maybe she's just what happens when someone decides to be the aspirin. To show up, to be present, to take away the pain without being asked.

I still see her sometimes. In the hospital. On the street. In the mirror, late at night, when I'm exhausted and overwhelmed and wondering if any of it matters.

She never stays long. But she doesn't have to.

Just looking at her makes the headache go away.
