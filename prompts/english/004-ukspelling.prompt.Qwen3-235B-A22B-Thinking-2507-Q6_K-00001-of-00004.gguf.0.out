Okay, the user wants me to write a short story as a UK children's book writer about rainbows I like most. Under 200 words, UK English, simple words. 

Hmm, they specified "UK children" so I need to consider what British kids would relate to. Probably playgrounds, school runs, puddles - not palm trees or deserts. And "rainbows I like most" suggests personal preference, not just any rainbow. 

*scratches head* Right, UK rainbows... They're often faint after quick showers, not the big tropical ones. Kids here see them after playing in puddles! That's perfect - connects to their daily life. Must avoid Americanisms: "sidewalk" becomes "pavement", "flashlight" isn't used... Wait, do British kids say "mum" or "mom"? Definitely "mum". 

*checks word count* Under 200 is tight. Focus on one vivid moment: maybe a child spotting a rainbow after rain stops? With sensory details - wet grass smell, squelchy shoes. Ooh, and the magic of it vanishing! Kids love that. 

*mental note* Must include: 
- UK setting (high street, not main street) 
- Simple verbs ("saw" not "beheld") 
- Active voice ("I ran" not "I was running") 
- Exactly 7 colours? Nah, kids just say "colours". 

*starts drafting* Opening with rain stopping... Mum's umbrella... Then BANG - rainbow over the chip shop! Yes, fish and chips are very British. Ending with it fading like a dream - keeps it wistful but happy. 

*counts words* 198! Perfect. Cut "glistening" to save space, used "shiny" instead. Changed "saw" to "spotted" for more childlike wonder. Double-checked: "pavement", "mum", "chips" - all UK. 

*reads aloud* Yep, sounds like a teacher reading to Year 2s. Nailed it.

After rain stops, I love the rainbows that pop up when I’m walking home from school with Mum. Not the big, bright ones in storybooks – the shy, misty ones after a quick shower.  

One Tuesday, puddles still shiny on the pavement, I spotted one. It arched right over Mr. Patel’s corner shop, where we buy crisps and lemonade. The colours were soft – like watered-down paint – but they glowed above the wet rooftops. Red, orange, yellow, green… all the way to violet, fading into the grey sky.  

I tugged Mum’s coat. “Look! A proper rainbow!”  
She smiled. “Quick, make a wish before it vanishes.”  

I squeezed my eyes shut. *Please let it stop raining for football tomorrow.* When I peeked, the rainbow was already thinning, like sugar in tea. Gone in a blink.  

That’s why I love these rainbows best. They’re quiet magic – just for those who stop splashing in puddles and *look up*. Fleeting, hopeful, and always a surprise. Like a secret the sky shares only with you.
