Here are the identified issues in the text, categorized as grammar/tense/agreement, stylistic, and other problems:

### Grammar/Tense/Agreement Issues:
1. **"I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something"** - The contraction "he's" (he is) is grammatically correct, but the phrasing could be more formal ("I cannot help but agree that he is probably onto something").  
2. **"My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic"** - "On the same line of logic" is awkward; "in line with the same logic" would be more standard.  
3. **"it seems their monopolies are still functional"** - The passive "it seems" is grammatically correct but weakens the statement; a more direct phrasing like "their monopolies appear to still be functional" would be better.  
4. **"And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs"** - The parenthetical "(GOOG mainly)" disrupts flow; it should be integrated into the sentence (e.g., "And as we've seen with Google's first round of layoffs, mainly...").  
5. **"Those who read history knows"** - Subject-verb agreement error: "Those... knows" should be "Those... know."  

### Stylistic Issues:
1. **"So there's a running story about..."** - The informal "So there's" is conversational but weakens the opening; a more direct introduction would be stylistically stronger.  
2. **"McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders"** - The nickname "McKinsey Pichai" is informal and potentially disrespectful; it may be better to refer to him by his actual name.  
3. **"In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose"** - The phrase "In America We Trust" is jarring and overly colloquial; it should be rephrased for clarity (e.g., "In America, they are capitalist enough...").  
4. **"The party's gonna end sooner or later"** - The slang "gonna" is informal and should be replaced with "is going to" for a more professional tone.  
5. **"Saving up for 'FI' isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity"** - The abbreviation "FI" (Financial Independence) is niche and may not be universally understood; it should be spelled out or avoided.  

### Other Problems:
1. **"if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude"** - The phrasing is slightly unclear; it could be reworded for better clarity (e.g., "if only because I would have hated participating in and enabling...").  
2. **"the free money is draining away"** - The term "free money" is vague; it should be clarified (e.g., "easy money" or "low-interest capital").  
3. **"product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard"** - The neologism "enshittification" is informal and may not be widely understood; a more standard term like "deterioration in product quality" would be better.  
4. **"we're in a state of flux"** - The phrase is clich√© and weakens the argument; a more specific description of the flux would be more effective.  
5. **"we're still sane though, just unique circumstances"** - The informal "though" and "we're" are conversational but undermine the seriousness of the point; it should be rephrased (e.g., "we remain rational, though our circumstances are unique"). [end of text]
