Every night, Mia lay her head on her favorite pillow, the one with faded blue stripes. As she closed her eyes, the darkness outside seemed to melt away, replaced by a soft, comforting cloud that cradled her dreams. She always imagined that cloud was someone special, someone who cared for her as much as she cared for them.

One evening, her best friend, Leo, visited. He brought a bouquet of wildflowers and told Mia a story so dramatic that Mia thought he was exaggerating every detail. “I rescued a whole herd of goats from a burning barn!” he declared, grinning. But Mia only smiled, knowing he was just being Leo—funny, a little over-the-top, but always true to his heart.

But it wasn't Leo's grand stories that made Mia feel loved. It was the quiet moments: the way he tucked her in, the gentle hand on her shoulder, the way he listened when she whispered her worries. The pillow and the imaginary cloud were just symbols of the warmth she felt from Leo’s real, everyday love.

One night, when the clouds outside swirled into a gentle rain, Mia woke to find Leo sitting beside her, holding her hand. “I love you,” he whispered softly, not needing to exaggerate or perform. Mia knew then that love wasn’t about grand gestures—it was in the small, steady things: a shared pillow, a comforting cloud of friendship, and the quiet certainty that someone cares for you just as you are.

And that, Mia realized, is the most important kind of love of all. [end of text]
