The last time I felt truly surprised by a thought, it was this: **we're living through the great age of endings.**

Not apocalypse—though that's the lazy read. I mean something more specific. We're witnessing the end of *default states*. The end of assuming things will stay as they are.

Think about it. For most of human history, you could reasonably assume your grandchildren would understand the world you grew up in. The plow worked the same. The seasons came when expected. Even through industrialization, the *shape* of life held—cities grew, yes, but morning meant breakfast, evening meant rest, humans remained the only thinking things around.

Now? We're actively dismantling our defaults without quite admitting it. The climate we took for granted. The cognitive monopoly humans held (fragile, already cracking). The very notion that reality isn't negotiable—that there is a shared "what happened" we can appeal to.

What's fascinating isn't the change itself. It's that we're *aware* of the ending while it's happening. Most civilizational transitions happened to people who didn't know they were in one. The medieval peasant didn't think "I'm in the medieval period." But we know. We name our own transition as we live it: the Anthropocene, the Information Age, the whatever-comes-next.

There's something almost luxurious in this awareness, and something terrible too. Like being told the exact structural integrity of the bridge you're crossing.

I find myself wondering what replaces defaults. Perhaps intentionality—nothing given, everything chosen. Or perhaps fragmentation, where "what's happening" becomes genuinely local, genuinely multiple, with no overhead view possible.

Either way, the age of taking things for granted is ending. Whether what follows is freedom or exhaustion probably depends on whether we notice we've stopped noticing. [end of text]
