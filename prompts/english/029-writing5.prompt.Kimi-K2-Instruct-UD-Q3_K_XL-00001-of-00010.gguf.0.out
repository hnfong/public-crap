Title: The Green Bell Rings

My name is Liang, Form 4 at St. Bonaventure College, Kowloon. Everyone thinks I’m just another boy who always wears long sleeves even in summer and never joins the swimming gala. They don’t know the sleeves hide faint leaf-veins on my arms, or that water makes my ears pointier. I’m a wood elf—well, half, on my mother’s side. Mum told me to keep it quiet, because “Hong Kong people will think you’re filming a fantasy drama without permit.” So every morning I put on the uniform like armour: white shirt, grey trousers, and the school tie that feels like a vine trying to strangle me.

First lesson is Chemistry. The lab smells of ethanol and chalk dust, which is awful when you can actually smell the sadness of cut trees inside the ethanol. I sit at the back and pretend to take notes, but I’m really drawing tiny runes on the margin so the Bunsen burner won’t flare up. Last month I forgot; the flame turned emerald and Miss Cheung gave me extra homework instead of applause. Humans are hard to impress.

Recess is safer. I hurry to the corner behind the gym where three old banyan trees grow through the fence. Their roots crack the concrete like slow-motion karate. I press my palm to the trunk and whisper in the old tongue: “Hold tight, grandfather.” The bark warms, and a single leaf drops—my allowance for the day. I tuck it into my pocket; later I’ll fold it into a paper crane that can fly to the library and fetch me answers during dictation.

During English, Mr. Lam asks us to write about “a place you belong.” I write about a forest that no map has ever shown, where the moon is always a silver coin caught in branches. He circles the word “branches” and writes “awkward metaphor.” I almost laugh. If only he knew it’s a memory, not a metaphor.

Lunchtime is the hardest. The canteen smells of fried spam and plastic trays. My stomach wants berries and spring water, but I queue anyway. The girl in front, Ka-Yan from 4B, drops her wallet. Coins roll everywhere. Without thinking I kneel—too fast, too silent. My knees don’t even creak. She stares. “You move like a cat,” she says. I panic and answer, “I do yoga.” Smooth, Liang. Very smooth.

After school I have choir practice. Choir is perfect: no one questions why I can hold a high C longer than the piano’s sustain pedal. My voice is part wind, part memory of birds. When we sing “Greensleeves,” the fluorescent lights flicker like fireflies. The conductor blames the old building’s wiring. I blame nostalgia.

One Tuesday the bullying starts. Three boys corner me near the lockers, calling me “Nature Boy” because I once told them plastic straws hurt sea turtles. They push me; my shoulder hits the metal and a bruise blooms the colour of moss. I could call the trees for help—one snap of my fingers and the ivy outside would slither in like green serpents—but Mum’s warning rings louder: “No magic where cameras live.” So I just pick up my books and walk away. My ears burn beneath my hair.

That night I go home to our tiny flat in Mong Kok. Mum is watering the apartment’s jungle: potted ferns hanging from curtain rails, a lime tree on the balcony, mint growing out of old milk cartons. She sees the bruise and her eyes flash storm-green. “Use your words, not your roots,” she says. I nod, but inside I’m already planning.

Next day I arrive early. In the courtyard I kneel by the dying ixora hedge and press both hands into the soil. I give it a drop of my own sap—just a drop, enough to share, not to steal. By afternoon the hedge is blooming so wildly the janitor thinks it’s a miracle fertiliser advert. The flowers are bright orange; they look like lanterns against the concrete. Ka-Yan walks past, stops, and takes a photo. “Pretty,” she says. “You have a green thumb.” I shrug, cheeks hot.

The bullies return, but this time the hedge remembers. Tiny thorns snag their blazers. They yelp and retreat. Ka-Yan watches from the staircase, eyebrows raised. Later she finds me behind the banyans. “You’re different,” she says. My heart thuds like a woodpecker. “Different can be good,” I reply. She smiles, and for a moment the city noise fades into forest hush.

Exams come. Stress makes the fluorescent lights buzz louder, makes my skin itch for soil. One night I sneak to the school garden and plant an acorn under the flagpole. I sing the lullaby of oaks, low and slow. Nothing happens—yet.

Graduation day, the flagpole cracks. A young oak has grown overnight, impossible, pushing the pole aside like a spear through paper. The principal is furious, but the tree is already taller than the basketball hoop. Its leaves shimmer the exact green of my pocket leaf. I stand in line in the hall, robe too hot, tie still strangling. When they call my name, the oak’s highest branch waves through the window, as if waving back. I grin so wide my ears almost peek out.

After the ceremony Ka-Yan hands me a small box. Inside is a silver ring shaped like a twig. “So you always remember this place,” she says. I slip it on; it fits perfectly. Maybe I’m not the only one keeping secrets.

I still can’t swim in public, still flinch at the smell of ethanol, still write awkward metaphors. But now, when the green bell rings at 3:30, I don’t run for the MTR. I linger beneath the new oak, listening to the wind that only half-elves can hear, telling me: Grow slow, grow strong, grow home. [end of text]
