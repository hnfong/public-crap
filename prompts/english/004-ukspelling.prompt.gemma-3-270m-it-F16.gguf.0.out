The sky was a canvas of vibrant hues, a rainbow dancing in the air. It was a beautiful sight, a reminder of the beauty that exists all around us. I loved the way the colors blended together, like a gentle mist. It felt like a magic spell, a promise of something wonderful. The rainbow was a reminder that even in the darkest of days, there's always a glimmer of hope. [end of text]
