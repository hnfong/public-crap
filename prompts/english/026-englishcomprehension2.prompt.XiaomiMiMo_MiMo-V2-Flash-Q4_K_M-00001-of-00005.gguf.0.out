<think>First, the question says: "There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block." So, let's break this down. We have a stack of blocks. From top to bottom, it seems like there are three black blocks, then a block of unknown color, and then a blue block. So, the order is: top: three black blocks, then unknown color block, then blue block at the bottom.

Then, it says: "We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other." So, we remove all blocks from the stack. There are three black blocks, one unknown color block, and one blue block. That's five blocks in total. Then we add one additional green block, so now we have six blocks: three black, one unknown, one blue, and one green. We shuffle these six blocks and then put them back on top of each other, meaning we form a new stack.

Finally, it says: "The yellow block is on top of blue block." But in the initial description, there was no yellow block mentioned. Let me read the question again carefully: "There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block." So, initially, we have three black blocks, then a block of unknown color, then a blue block. No yellow block mentioned initially. But after shuffling and adding a green block, we have a new stack, and in this new stack, the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

But where did the yellow block come from? The question doesn't mention a yellow block initially. It only mentions black blocks, unknown color block, blue block, and then we add a green block. So, after shuffling, we have six blocks: three black, one unknown, one blue, and one green. But then it says "the yellow block is on top of blue block." This implies that there is a yellow block in the new stack. But we only added a green block, so where is the yellow block coming from?

Perhaps the unknown color block is yellow? That might be the key. Let me think about this.

The question is: "What color is the block we don't know the color of?" So, we need to find the color of the block that was initially unknown.

After shuffling and adding a green block, we have a new stack, and in this new stack, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. But we only have three black, one unknown, one blue, and one green. So, for there to be a yellow block, it must be that the unknown color block is yellow. Because otherwise, we have no yellow block.

But let's confirm: initially, we have three black blocks, one block of unknown color, and one blue block. After removing all, we add one green block, so now we have three black, one unknown, one blue, one green. Then we shuffle and put them back. Now, in the new stack, it is stated that the yellow block is on top of the blue block. But we don't have a yellow block unless the unknown color is yellow.

Therefore, the block we don't know the color of must be yellow.

But is there any other possibility? The question says "the yellow block is on top of blue block." This might be a statement about the new stack after shuffling. So, in the new stack, there is a yellow block and a blue block, and the yellow block is directly on top of the blue block.

Since we have only six blocks: three black, one unknown, one blue, one green, and for there to be a yellow block, the unknown must be yellow. Otherwise, we have no yellow block.

But what if the green block is yellow? No, it says we add one additional green block, so it is green, not yellow.

So, the only way to have a yellow block is if the unknown color block is yellow.

Therefore, the block we don't know the color of is yellow.

The question asks: "What color is the block we don't know the color of? Only answer in one word. Don't explain."

So, my answer should be "yellow".

But let me make sure there is no trick here. The initial stack has three black blocks on top of the unknown block, and then blue block beneath. After shuffling, we have a new stack, and yellow is on top of blue. This doesn't directly relate to the initial order, but since we shuffle, the order is random, but the fact that yellow is on top of blue in the new stack doesn't give us information about the unknown color unless we assume that yellow is present only if unknown is yellow.

But we have green block added, so if unknown is not yellow, then we have no yellow block, but the statement says there is a yellow block on top of blue block, so indeed, yellow must be present, so unknown must be yellow.

Perhaps the unknown block could be blue, but we already have a blue block, and the statement says yellow on top of blue, so blue is present, but yellow is also present, so unknown must be yellow.

Yes, that seems consistent.

So, the answer is yellow.</think>yellow [end of text]
