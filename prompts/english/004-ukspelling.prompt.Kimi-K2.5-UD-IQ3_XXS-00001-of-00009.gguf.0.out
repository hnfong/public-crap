The Best Rainbow

I saw the best rainbow last Tuesday. It was after school, and the rain had stopped.

The sky was still grey, like an old blanket. But there it was—a huge rainbow over the park.

It was not faint or wobbly. It was bright and strong. I could see all the colours: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. The purple was hard to spot, but I found it.

The rainbow seemed to touch the ground near the swings. I ran towards it, but it moved away. Mum says you can never reach the end. I think she is right.

What I liked most was how it made everyone stop and look. A man with a dog. A girl on a bike. Even Mrs Patel from the corner shop. We all stood there, wet and smiling.

Then the sun went in, and the rainbow faded. But I still remember it.

That is my favourite kind of rainbow. The sort that makes strangers friends, just for a moment. [end of text]
