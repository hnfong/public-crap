Sure! Here are the answers to your questions:

**1. How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?**

The letter "A" first appears in the spelling of the number **"ten"** (which is written as "10"). However, since "10" uses the digit "1" and "0," not the letter "A," we must look for the first whole number whose name (in English) contains the letter "A."

Let's list the numbers and their names:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 — none have an "A" in their names.

Ten — "ten" (no "A").

Eleven — "eleven" (no "A").

Twelve — "twelve" (no "A").

Thirteen — "thirteen" (no "A").

Fourteen — "fourteen" (no "A").

Fifteen — "fifteen" (no "A").

Sixteen — "sixteen" (no "A").

Seventeen — "seventeen" (no "A").

Eighteen — "eighteen" (no "A").

Nineteen — "nineteen" ✅ **This contains an "A".**

So, you have to count up to **nineteen** (the number 19) before the English spelling of a whole number includes the letter "A".

**2. Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox ..."; What is the sentence famous for?**

The sentence is famous for being a **" pangram"**, which means it contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once. The complete sentence is:

**"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."**

So, filling in the blank:  
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

This sentence is often used as a classic example of a pangram.

**3. Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.**

Once upon a time, three little pigs set out to build houses. The first pig built his house of straw. It was quick to build but soon tumbled down when the wind blew.

The second pig built his house of sticks. It was stronger than straw but still not sturdy enough; the sticks crumbled when the next big storm came.

The third pig, being clever, decided to build his house of bricks. It took a long time, but it was the sturdiest house of all and stood strong against any storm.

As the pigs were resting, a beautiful girl named Red Riding Hood wandered through the forest. She was looking for her grandmother, who lived nearby. The third pig, hearing her footsteps, opened the door and greeted Red Riding Hood.

At that moment, the big bad wolf, who had been lurking outside, saw the bright red cloak and tried to sneak in. Red Riding Hood, noticing the wolf, asked him where he was going. The wolf tried to trick her, saying he was going to her grandmother's house to ask for aporridge. Red Riding Hood followed the wolf, but when she saw his true face, she ran back to the house and closed the door.

The clever third pig had set a trap. He left a plate of porridge at the door with a straw in it. The wolf ate the porridge and tried to swallow the straw, but it got stuck. The pigs came and caught the wolf, saving them all from danger.

From that day on, the third pig was known as the wisest and bravest of all the pigs, and Red Riding Hood learned to always be careful in the forest.

And they all lived happily ever after. [end of text]
