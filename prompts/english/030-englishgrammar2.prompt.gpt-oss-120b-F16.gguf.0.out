<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to review each English translation and suggest modifications. Provide one suggested English translation per sentence, or just output original if no changes needed.

We have 5 sentences.

We need to produce output like:

1. Suggested sentence: ...
2. Suggested sentence: ...
...

But the example shows "A. Suggested sentence: ..." and "B. Suggested sentence: ...". So we should follow that format: number then "Suggested sentence:".

If no changes needed, just output the original sentence (presumably the English translation). But we need to decide if any are fine.

Let's examine each.

Sentence 1:

Cantonese: "你咁趕做咩啫，你慌人哋唔等你咩？"

English given: "Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?"

Issues: "Why are you hurry?" should be "Why are you in such a hurry?" or "Why are you hurrying?" Also "Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?" could be "Why are you worried that they won't wait for you?" The original Cantonese meaning: "Why are you in such a hurry? Are you afraid that people won't wait for you?" So we can propose: "Why are you in such a hurry? Are you worried that others won't wait for you?" That sounds natural.

Sentence 2:

Cantonese: "佢份人夠大量，唔同班𡃁仔計較。" (Note: "𡃁仔" maybe "小孩"? Means "kids".) English: "He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids."

Issues: "magnanimous" is okay but "He is a magnanimous person" maybe "He is magnanimous". Also "doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids" maybe "doesn't bother arguing over petty things with the kids." The phrase "不同班𡃁仔計較" means "doesn't argue over petty matters with the kids." So suggested: "He is magnanimous and doesn't argue over petty matters with the kids." Or "He is generous and doesn't fuss over trivial things with the kids." We'll propose.

Sentence 3:

Cantonese: "學語文冇捷徑，要靠大量浸淫。" English: "There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it."

Issues: "massive exposure" maybe "extensive immersion". Also "There is no shortcut to learning a language; it requires a lot of immersion." So suggested: "There is no shortcut to learning a language; you need plenty of immersion." Or "There is no shortcut to learning a language; it requires extensive immersion." We'll propose.

Sentence 4:

Cantonese: "小新喺同事面前讚美女朋友有幾温柔。" English: "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender."

Issues: "Siu-san" maybe "Siu-san" is a name; "very tender" maybe "very gentle" or "very sweet". Also "praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for how gentle she is." So suggested: "Siu-san praised his girlfriend's gentle nature in front of his colleagues." Or "Siu-san praised his girlfriend for being very gentle in front of his colleagues." We'll propose.

Sentence 5:

Cantonese: "我日日都搭地鐵返學。" English: "I take the metro to school every day."

This is fine. Could also be "I take the subway to school every day." Both fine. The original translation is okay. So we can output original sentence unchanged.

Thus final answer:

1. Suggested sentence: Why are you in such a hurry? Are you worried that others won't wait for you?
2. Suggested sentence: He is magnanimous and doesn't argue over petty matters with the kids.
3. Suggested sentence: There is no shortcut to learning a language; you need plenty of immersion.
4. Suggested sentence: Siu-san praised his girlfriend for being very gentle in front of his colleagues.
5. I take the metro to school every day.

Make sure format matches example: each line start with number and "Suggested sentence:" for changed ones, else just original.
