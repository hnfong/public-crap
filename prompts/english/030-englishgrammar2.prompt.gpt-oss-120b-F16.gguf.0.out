<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to review each English translation and suggest modifications. Provide one suggested English translation per sentence, or output original if no changes needed.

We have 5 sentences.

We need to produce output like:

1. Suggested sentence: ...

2. Suggested sentence: ...

...

Make sure sentences are simple, fluent, native-like, to the point.

Let's examine each.

Sentence 1:

Cantonese: "你咁趕做咩啫，你慌人哋唔等你咩？"

Rough meaning: "Why are you in such a hurry? Are you afraid that others won't wait for you?" The given translation: "Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?" That's ungrammatical. Should be: "Why are you in such a hurry? Are you worried that they won't wait for you?" Or combine: "Why are you in such a rush? Are you afraid people won't wait for you?" Provide a single sentence? The instruction: "give one suggested English translation per sentence". So we can combine into one sentence: "Why are you in such a hurry? Are you worried that they won't wait for you?" That's two sentences but still one translation. Could also be "Why are you rushing? Are you afraid they won't wait for you?" That's fine.

We'll output: Suggested sentence: Why are you rushing? Are you afraid they won't wait for you?

Sentence 2:

Cantonese: "佢份人夠大量，唔同班𡃁仔計較。" Means "He is a generous person, he doesn't argue over petty things with the kids." The given translation: "He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids." "Magnanimous" okay but "haggle" maybe not right; "argue" or "quibble". Also "kids" maybe "classmates"? The phrase "唔同班𡃁仔計較" means "doesn't bother to argue with the class's troublemakers"? Actually "𡃁仔" is slang for "troublemaker, brat". So translation: "He is generous and doesn't bother arguing with the troublemakers." So suggested: "He's generous and doesn't argue with the troublemakers." Or "He’s a big‑hearted person who doesn’t bother quibbling with the kids." We'll propose: Suggested sentence: He's a generous person who doesn't argue with the kids over petty matters.

Sentence 3:

Cantonese: "學語文冇捷徑，要靠大量浸淫。" Means "There is no shortcut to learning a language; you need a lot of immersion." The given translation: "There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it." That's okay but could be smoother: "There’s no shortcut to learning a language; you need plenty of immersion." So we can suggest: Suggested sentence: There’s no shortcut to learning a language; you need plenty of immersion.

Sentence 4:

Cantonese: "小新喺同事面前讚美女朋友有幾温柔。" Means "Siu‑san praised his girlfriend’s tenderness in front of his colleagues." The given translation: "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender." Slight grammar: "praises his girlfriend for being very tender" okay. Could be "Siu‑san praised his girlfriend’s tenderness in front of his colleagues." We'll suggest: Suggested sentence: Siu‑san praised his girlfriend’s tenderness in front of his colleagues.

Sentence 5:

Cantonese: "我日日都搭地鐵返學。" Means "I take the subway to school every day." The given translation: "I take the metro to school every day." That's fine. Could be "I take the subway to school every day." Both okay. No change needed? The original translation uses "metro". In Hong Kong, "MTR" is called "MTR" or "subway". "Metro" is okay but maybe "subway". But it's fine. The instruction: if no changes needed, output original sentence. So we output the original English sentence: I take the metro to school every day.

Now format output: each line with number and suggested sentence.

Probably like:

1. Suggested sentence: Why are you rushing? Are you afraid they won't wait for you?

2. Suggested sentence: He's a generous person who doesn't argue with the kids over petty matters.

3. Suggested sentence: There’s no shortcut to learning a language; you need plenty of immersion.

4. Suggested sentence: Siu‑san praised his girlfriend’s tenderness in front of his colleagues.

5. I take the metro to school every day.

Make sure punctuation correct.
