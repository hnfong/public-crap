Okay, let me tackle this translation review task. The user wants me to check English translations of Cantonese sentences, focusing on making them sound natural and native-like while keeping them simple. 

First, I'll go through each pair carefully. For sentence 1: "Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?" Hmm, "hurry" should be "in a hurry" since it's an adjective phrase. And the second part feels clunky - native speakers would say "worry they won't wait" without "that". Also, the double question structure in Cantonese doesn't translate well; combining them with "so" makes it flow better.

Sentence 2: "He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle..." Wait, "magnanimous" is too formal for casual speech. "Big-hearted" sounds more natural. And "haggle over trivial issues with the kids" - "kids" might imply children, but "those petty guys" fits the Cantonese "班𡃁仔" better. Should fix the comma splice too by making it one smooth sentence.

Sentence 3 looks solid actually. "No shortcut to learn" should be "learning", but the rest is perfect - "massive exposure" is exactly how language teachers talk. Just that tiny grammar tweak needed.

Sentence 4: "praises... for her being very tender" - oof, that's awkward. Native speakers would say "praises how温柔 his girlfriend is" or just "praises his girlfriend's温柔". Also "Siu-san" should be "Shin-chan" since it's a name reference. And "tender" isn't quite right for personality - "gentle" is the standard term.

Last one: "I take the metro to school every day." Textbook perfect. No changes needed - simple, correct, and natural.

*checks notes* Important to remember the user's examples showed they want: 
- Contractions ("don't" not "do not") 
- Dropping unnecessary words 
- Natural phrasing over literal translation 
- Fixing grammar errors but keeping simplicity

Better make sure my suggestions match that. Like in sentence 1, changing to "you're in such a rush" captures the Cantonese "咁趕" better than just "hurry". And for sentence 4, specifying "in front of coworkers" instead of "colleagues" since the user said "simple" English.

1. Suggested sentence: Why are you in such a rush? You don't need to worry they won't wait for you.  
*(Changes: "hurry" → "in such a rush" for natural phrasing; removed redundant "that" and simplified second clause to match native contractions/flow)*  

2. Suggested sentence: He's big-hearted and doesn't bother arguing with those petty guys.  
*(Changes: Replaced overly formal "magnanimous" with casual "big-hearted"; "haggle over trivial issues with the kids" → "bother arguing with those petty guys" to match Cantonese tone of "班𡃁仔"; fixed comma splice)*  

3. Suggested sentence: There’s no shortcut to learning a language—it takes massive exposure.  
*(Changes: Added gerund "learning" for correct grammar; replaced semicolon with em dash for smoother rhythm while keeping original meaning)*  

4. Suggested sentence: Shin-chan praises his girlfriend’s gentleness in front of coworkers.  
*(Changes: "Siu-san" → culturally recognizable "Shin-chan"; "for her being very tender" → natural phrasing "praises his girlfriend’s gentleness"; "colleagues" → simpler "coworkers")*  

5. I take the metro to school every day.  
*(No changes needed—simple, grammatically correct, and native-sounding)* [end of text]
