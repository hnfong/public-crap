Of course! Here are the answers to your questions.

### 1. How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?

You would have to count all the way to **one thousand (1,000)**.

If you spell out the numbers from zero to nine hundred ninety-nine, you will not use the letter "A". The numbers are:
zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty...

...and so on, through words like "twenty-two," "one hundred," "five hundred forty-six," and "nine hundred ninety-nine." None of these contain the letter "A".

The first whole number that requires an "A" is **one thousand**.

### 2. Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox ..."; What is the sentence famous for?

The complete sentence is: **"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."**

This sentence is famous for being a **pangram**. A pangram is a sentence that uses every letter of the alphabet at least once. Because of this, it became the standard sentence used for testing typewriters, computer keyboards, and fonts to ensure that all keys were working correctly and displayed properly. It's short, coherent, and efficiently includes all 26 letters of the English alphabet.

### 3. Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.

The three little pigs had just seen off the Big Bad Wolf, who was now a sopping-wet, defeated mess at the bottom of the brick chimney. They were celebrating their cleverness with a feast of acorn squash and dandelion tea when a soft knock came at their sturdy oak door.

"Who's there?" called the first little pig, peering through the peephole.

Standing outside was a little girl in a bright red cloak, carrying a basket. "It's Little Red Riding Hood," she said, her voice trembling slightly. "I'm lost. The path to my grandmother's cottage has vanished, and I keep seeing a pair of very shifty yellow eyes in the woods."

The pigs looked at each other. They knew all about shifty eyes in the woods. The second little pig, who was still a bit jumpy from his stick house being blown down, whispered, "It could be a trick! The Wolf in disguise!"

But the third little pig, the wisest, opened the door. "Come in, child. You're safe here. We know a thing or two about wolves."

Red Riding Hood gratefully entered the cozy brick house. She told them about her journey and the wolf who had tricked her and was now waiting for her at her grandmother's cottage. The pigs listened, their snouts twitching with anger.

"That's the same wolf!" oinked the first pig. "The one who tried to huff and puff!"

A plan formed quickly. The third little pig explained, "My house is wolf-proof, but your grandmother's is not. We will help you."

The three little pigs donned their best disguises: the first pig wore Red Riding Hood's cloak, the second put on her bonnet, and the third, the cleverest, carried the basket. They marched off to grandmother's cottage, with the real Red Riding Hood hiding safely behind a tree.

When the Wolf, disguised as the grandmother, called out, "Come in, my dear!" he was surprised to see not one little girl, but three very determined-looking pigs enter the room.

"Grandmother, what big ears you have!" said the first pig in a high-pitched voice.
"The better to eavesdrop on your plans, my piggies!" growled the Wolf, dropping the disguise.
"And what a big pot of boiling water you have in the fireplace!" said the third pig, pointing to the cauldron they had quickly prepared.

The Wolf, confused and arrogant, lunged. But the pigs were ready. They dodged, and with a mighty heave, they pushed the surprised Wolf, who was still off-balance, straight into the bubbling pot. That was the end of the Big Bad Wolf.

Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother, who had been locked safely in the pantry, rejoiced. From that day on, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became the best of friends, forming the very first "Forest Watch" program, dedicated to outsmarting any big, bad anything that dared to trouble their woods. And they all lived safely and cleverly ever after.
