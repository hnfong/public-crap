**Grammar Mistakes:**

1. **Tense Inconsistency**: "So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..." The use of present continuous ("there's a running story") and present simple ("are not doing") is inconsistent. It should be either "there is a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying..." or "there's been a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically having said...".

2. **Subject-Verb Agreement**: "And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective." The phrase "this might seem to" should be "this might seem like" or "this might seem to be".

3. **Pronoun Reference**: "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional..." The pronoun "it" is ambiguous. It could refer to either "META" or "GOOG".

4. **Tense Inconsistency**: "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." The use of present perfect ("we've seen") and present simple ("is ready") is inconsistent. It should be either "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai was definitely ready to do..." or "And as we see with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do...".

5. **Word Choice**: "In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid." The phrase "how I participated and enabled" should be "that I participated in and enabled" for clarity.

**Serious Stylistic Issues:**

1. **Informal Language**: The use of informal language such as "So there's", "I can't help but agree", and "the party's gonna end" may not be suitable for all audiences or contexts.

2. **Run-on Sentences**: Some sentences are overly long and complex, making them difficult to follow. For example, the sentence starting with "In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year..." could be broken down into simpler, shorter sentences.

3. **Lack of Clarity**: Some phrases are unclear or ambiguous. For example, "the free money is draining away" and "the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial 'efficiency'" could be clarified for better understanding.

4. **Inconsistent Tone**: The tone shifts from analytical to personal opinion, which can be jarring. For example, the shift from discussing tech stocks to personal financial decisions and then back to industry analysis.

5. **Use of Jargon**: The use of jargon such as "FI", "enshittification", and "monotonic-increasing" may not be understood by all readers. These terms should be explained or replaced with more commonly understood language.

**Other Problems:**

1. **Lack of Citations**: The text makes several claims and references to studies or events (e.g., Andreessen Horowitz's statement, tech stocks being down last year) but does not provide citations or sources to support these claims.

2. **Personal Bias**: The text expresses strong personal opinions and biases, which may not be appropriate or relevant in all contexts. For example, the phrases "predatory capitalist attitude" and "ruthless capitalist engine" express a negative view of capitalism that may not be shared by all readers.

3. **Speculation**: The text includes speculative statements (e.g., "I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years") that may not be relevant or useful to readers.

4. **Off-Topic Discussions**: The text includes discussions that may be off-topic or tangential to the main subject. For example, the discussion about the author's personal financial decisions and living situation.

5. **Lack of Conclusion**: The text does not provide a clear conclusion or summary of the main points. The ending is abrupt and does not tie back to the initial discussion about Andreessen Horowitz's statement. [end of text]
