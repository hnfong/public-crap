1. Suggested sentence: Why are you in such a hurry? Are you worried they won't wait for you?  
2. Suggested sentence: He's a very generous person and doesn't bother with trivial arguments with the younger guys.  
3. Suggested sentence: There's no shortcut to learning a language; it requires extensive immersion.  
4. Suggested sentence: Siu-san praised his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for being so gentle.  
5. Original sentence: I take the metro to school every day.  

(Note: "Siu-san" in sentence 4 seems to be a typo or mistranslation of "小新" (Shin-chan), but I kept it as written since the task is to review the provided English translation.) [end of text]
