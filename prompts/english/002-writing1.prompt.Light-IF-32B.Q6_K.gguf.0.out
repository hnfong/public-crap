**The Pillow on the Cloud**  

Lila had always been good at *exaggerating*. When she was little, she’d say the sky was so blue it hurt her eyes, or that the wind whispered secrets loud enough to wake the whole neighborhood. As she grew older, her exaggerations didn’t fade—they just got louder.  

She moved to the city to be a writer, thinking that if she could make people laugh with her words, she’d feel less alone. But the city was loud, and her heart was quieter than ever.  

One night, she stayed up too late writing, and when she finally fell asleep, she dreamed of a cloud. Not just any cloud—*her* cloud. It was soft, like the pillow she’d had since she was a kid, the one with the faded rabbit on it. The cloud floated over a quiet lake, and on it sat an old woman with a smile that felt like home.  

“Lila,” the woman said, “you’ve been carrying a heavy heart.”  

Lila blinked. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”  

The woman laughed, and the sound was like wind through leaves. “You think being loud makes you seen. But love is quiet. It’s in the pillow you tuck under your head when you’re scared. It’s in the way your mom made you tea when you cried. It’s in the moments you forget to exaggerate, and just *be*.”  

Lila felt tears on her cheeks. She’d forgotten all that.  

The cloud drifted, and the woman handed her the pillow. “Take this. Remember: love isn’t about being heard. It’s about being present.”  

When Lila woke up, the pillow was on her bed. The rabbit was still there, faded but warm.  

That day, she called her mom. She went to the park and sat with a stranger who looked sad. She wrote a story about a cloud and a pillow, and for the first time in years, it felt like her heart was light.  

Lila learned that day: love isn’t loud. It’s in the small, quiet things. And when you stop *exaggerating* to be seen, you finally see the love that’s been there all along.  

And from that day on, her pillow was never just a pillow. It was a reminder of the love that floats with her, like a cloud, wherever she goes. [end of text]
