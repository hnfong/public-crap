1. **One thousand**  
You would first encounter the letter "A" in the spelling of the whole number **"one thousand"** (1,000). All numbers below 1,000 (like "one", "two", ..., "nine hundred ninety-nine") do not contain the letter "a" in their standard American English spelling.

2. **"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."**  
This sentence is famous for being a **pangram**—a sentence that uses every letter of the alphabet at least once. It’s commonly used for testing typewriters, keyboards, and fonts.

3. **Story: The Three Little Pigs Meet Little Red Riding Hood**  
Once upon a time, three little pigs set out to build their homes in a clearing near the woods. One built a house of straw, one of sticks, and the wisest pig built his of bricks.

One sunny morning, as they were gathering berries, they met a little girl in a red cloak—Little Red Riding Hood—on her way to visit her grandmother.

"Hello!" chirped the first pig. "Where are you going with that basket?"

"To my grandmother’s house," she replied. "Through the forest."

"Be careful," warned the second pig. "The woods are full of surprises."

Just then, a rustling came from the trees. The wolf, who had recently chased the pigs, now eyed Red Riding Hood. But before he could speak, the third pig stepped forward.

"Wait!" he said. "You may think you’re clever, but we know your tricks. You huffed and puffed at my brick house—remember?"

The wolf slinked back, growling.

Red Riding Hood smiled. "Thank you, brave pig. Let me walk with you. Safety in numbers!"

So together—the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood—they walked through the woods, shared stories, and reached Grandmother’s house safely. The wolf, outsmarted and outnumbered, wandered off, muttering about bad luck and brick walls.

And from that day on, the pigs and Red Riding Hood became the best of friends, proving that cleverness and kindness always win.
