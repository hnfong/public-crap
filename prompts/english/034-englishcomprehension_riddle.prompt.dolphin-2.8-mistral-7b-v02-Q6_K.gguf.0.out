Consider this scenario:

Alice: Are you eating healthy?
Bob: Yes! Today I ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat.
Alice: Wow! Let me see.
Bob: (sends Alice a photo)
Alice: wtf

---
Question: what happened? What did Bob eat and was it healthy?

Bob ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat. It is unclear if this was healthy or not, as the description seems unusual and the reaction from Alice suggests confusion or disbelief.<|im_end|>
