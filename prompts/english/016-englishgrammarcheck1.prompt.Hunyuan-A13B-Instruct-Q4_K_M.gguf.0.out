### Grammar Mistakes (Tense and Agreement Issues)

1. **Subject-Verb Agreement**:  
   - "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic" → "My analysis... was exactly on the same line of logic." (Grammatically correct, but "back then" suggests past tense, which is consistent. No error here.)  
   - "it seems their monopolies are still functional" → "it seems their monopolies are still functional." (Grammatically correct, but "seems" and "are" are consistent.)  

2. **Tense Consistency**:  
   - "I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices" → "I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices." (Grammatically correct, but "wondered" and "would" are consistent.)  
   - "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half" → "I had no ounce of doubt that they could cut costs by almost half." (Tense shift: "had" requires "could" for past conditional consistency.)  

3. **Pronoun Agreement**:  
   - "shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people" → "shareholders are unhappy, they can always lay off more people." (Missing space after "layoff.")  
   - "McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard" → "McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." (Grammatically correct.)  

4. **Verb Form**:  
   - "the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial 'efficiency'" → "the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial 'efficiency.'" (Grammatically correct.)  
   - "product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard" → "product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard." (Grammatically correct.)  

5. **Unclear or Awkward Phrasing**:  
   - "the party's gonna end sooner or later" → "the party's gonna end sooner or later." (Colloquial and informal, but not a grammatical error.)  
   - "people in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like" → "people in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation of what their careers would look like." (Missing preposition "of.")

### Serious Stylistic Issues

1. **Repetition**:  
   - The phrase "in some form or another" is repeated unnecessarily in the sentence: "every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another." This could be streamlined for clarity and conciseness.  

2. **Overuse of Parenthetical Statements**:  
   - The text relies heavily on parentheses for additional commentary (e.g., "(there's actually no tech jobs here)" and "(We're still sane though, just unique circumstances)"). While these add context, they disrupt the flow of the narrative and could be integrated more smoothly into the main text.  

3. **Colloquial Tone**:  
   - Phrases like "the party's gonna end sooner or later" and "people who know approximately how much I make" undermine the otherwise formal tone of the essay. These could be rephrased for a more polished tone.  

4. **Vague or Ambiguous Language**:  
   - "small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech" → "small pockets of AI, which in practice are currently much smaller in operational scope than general tech." (The phrasing is awkward and could be clarified.)  

5. **Contradictory Statements**:  
   - "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose" → This statement is overly simplistic and potentially sarcastic, which might confuse readers. It could be rephrased to better align with the essay's tone and intent.

### Other Problems

1. **Clichés and Overused Phrases**:  
   - "Every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another" → This phrase is cliché and could be replaced with a more original observation.  

2. **Lack of Clarity in Complex Sentences**:  
   - "The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." → This sentence is overly reliant on cultural references and could benefit from more direct explanation.  

3. **Inconsistent Formatting**:  
   - Parentheses are used inconsistently, with some providing essential context and others feeling like afterthoughts. For example, "(There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors...)" could be integrated into the main sentence.  

4. **Overemphasis on Personal Experience**:  
   - The essay leans heavily on personal anecdotes (e.g., "Saving up for 'FI' isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry"). While relatable, this could detract from the broader argument.  

5. **Missed Opportunities for Stronger Transitions**:  
   - The essay jumps between ideas without clear transitions, making it harder for readers to follow the argument. For example, the shift from discussing layoffs to regulatory risks could be smoother.

### Summary of Key Issues  
- **Grammar**: Tense shifts (e.g., "had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs") and missing prepositions ("expectation what").  
- **Stylistic**: Overuse of parentheses, colloquial tone, repetition, and reliance on cultural references.  
- **Other**: Lack of clarity in complex sentences, inconsistent formatting, and overemphasis on personal experience.
