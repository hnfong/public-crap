## My Favourite Rainbows

My favourite rainbows aren't the big, bright ones everyone points at. They're the shy ones. The ones that peek out after a proper downpour, when the sun's trying to break through the clouds. 

They're not always full rainbows, mind. Sometimes it's just a little arc, a sliver of red and orange over Mrs. Higgins' garden fence. Or a faint green stripe above the school playing field. 

Those are the best. They feel like a secret. Like the sky's winking at *you*. 

I love how they smell like wet grass and sunshine. And how they disappear so quickly, like a magic trick. You blink, and poof! Gone. 

My Nan says they're fairy bridges. I reckon she's right. They're too lovely to be just rain and light. They're definitely fairy bridges. And I always look for them after a good shower. Always.
