The nickname "Aspirin" had followed her since childhood, a moniker that clung to her like a second skin. It wasn’t just her appearance that earned her the title; it was the way she seemed to radiate a quiet, almost imperceptible calm. People would say she had a "natural high," a state of being that made the world feel lighter, as if the weight of existence had been lifted. But no one ever asked how she achieved it. They just accepted it, like the air they breathed.  

Aspirin was a quiet girl, her presence more felt than seen. She moved through life with a deliberate grace, as though each step was a meditation. Her eyes, a soft hazel that shifted in the light, held a depth that made others pause. She didn’t speak much, but when she did, her words were measured, like the ticking of a clock that never rushed. Her friends called her "the calm in the storm," but they didn’t know the storm she’d weathered to get there.  

It wasn’t until her senior year of high school that the world began to notice her differently. A teacher, a woman with a sharp tongue and sharper eyes, noticed the way Aspirin would sit in the back of the classroom, her head resting on her desk, her breath slow and even. "You’re not sick," the teacher said one day, her voice cutting through the usual chatter. "You’re just… *aspirational*." The class snickered, but Aspirin didn’t flinch. She just smiled, a small, knowing thing that made the room feel colder.  

The teacher, a woman named Ms. Delaney, had a reputation for being tough. She’d once been a student herself, a girl who’d burned through her years in a blur of deadlines and deadlines. But she’d learned to slow down, to find the stillness in the chaos. She’d seen Aspirin’s quiet strength and wondered if it was something she could teach.  

So, one afternoon, she pulled Aspirin aside after class. "You’re not like the others," she said, her voice low. "You don’t rush. You don’t *need* to rush. What’s your secret?"  

Aspirin didn’t answer immediately. She just looked at Ms. Delaney, her expression unreadable. Then, slowly, she said, "I don’t know. Maybe I just don’t want to be *aspirational*."  

The room fell silent.  

Ms. Delaney laughed, a sound that was both amused and sad. "You’re not *aspirational*, Aspirin. You’re *aspirational*."  

And that, she realized, was the problem.  

Aspirin had spent her life chasing a state of being that felt like a destination, a place she could reach and hold onto. But the more she tried to grasp it, the more it slipped away, like sand through her fingers. She’d tried meditation, yoga, even a brief stint in a monastery in the mountains, but nothing stuck. The world kept moving, and she kept trying to keep up, only to find herself more exhausted than ever.  

It wasn’t until she stopped trying to *be* something that she began to *be* herself. She started to notice the small things—the way the light filtered through the trees, the sound of rain on the roof, the way her own breath felt when she wasn’t trying to control it. She stopped chasing the idea of being "aspirational" and started living it, not as a goal, but as a way of being.  

But the world didn’t always understand. People still called her "Aspirin," and sometimes, she wondered if they were right. Maybe she *was* aspirational, but not in the way they thought. Maybe she was just a girl who had learned to stop trying to be something and started being exactly what she was.  

And in that, she found peace.  

Not the kind that came from a pill or a mantra, but the kind that came from simply *being*.  

Aspirin, she realized, wasn’t a state of being. It was a choice. And sometimes, the hardest choice was to stop choosing.
