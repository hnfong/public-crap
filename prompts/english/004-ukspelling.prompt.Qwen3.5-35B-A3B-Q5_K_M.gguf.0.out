My favourite rainbows are the ones that appear after a summer shower in the garden. They do not stay long, just a few minutes before the sun hides behind a grey cloud again.

I like the way the colours look so bright against the wet grass. The red is like a strawberry, and the blue is like the sky on a clear day. Sometimes, the rainbow seems to touch the old oak tree at the end of the path. It looks like a giant, colourful bridge made of light.

I remember one time when I saw a double rainbow. The second one was fainter, like a ghost of the first. It made me feel very happy and small. I stood on my tippy-toes, hoping to see a pot of gold at the end, but there was only a muddy puddle.

Even though they are short, these rainbows make me smile. They remind me that after the rain, the sun always comes back to play. [end of text]
