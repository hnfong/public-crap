**The Rainbow in the Garden**  

One rainy afternoon, I ran to the garden, where the sky was a patchwork of grey and gold. Suddenly, a rainbow arched across the sky! It was the brightest one I’d ever seen—like a giant, wobbly smile.  

I stood there, breathless, as the rainbow shimmered. It wasn’t just one colour; it was a mix of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. It looked like a magic ladder, stretching from the earth to the clouds.  

I wished I could climb it, but I just stood there, smiling. Rainbows are special because they only appear when it’s raining and the sun peeks out. They’re like nature’s secret message: *“Look up, and magic is here.”*  

I’ll always remember that rainbow. It made me feel small and big all at once—like the world was full of wonders.
