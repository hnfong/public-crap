My favourite rainbows aren’t the big, bright ones after a summer storm. No—I love the *tiny* ones. The ones that dance on the garden hose spray on a sunny afternoon.  

I stand barefoot in the grass, holding the hose high. *Fwip!* A misty arc appears—small, wobbly, and perfect. It shimmers with all the colours, but it’s only as wide as my two hands held apart. I tiptoe closer, and it shrinks. I step back, and it grows again, like it’s playing hide-and-seek.  

Sometimes, if I look just right, I see a second, fainter rainbow above it—paler, with the colours flipped. My nan calls it a “double rainbow,” and says it means extra luck.  

Best of all, these little rainbows vanish the moment I stop spraying. But they’re always waiting, just behind the next sprinkle. They remind me that magic isn’t far away—it’s in the everyday, if you know where to look.  

And if you’re very quiet, and very still… you might just catch one too. [end of text]
