1. **How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?**  
You would have to count up to **1,000** ("one thousand") before using the letter **"A"** in the spelling of a whole number.  
*Explanation:* Numbers from one to 999 do not contain the letter "A" in their standard English spelling. For example:  
- "one" to "nine hundred ninety-nine" — no "A" appears.  
- But "one thousand" includes the letter "A" — so 1,000 is the first number where "A" appears.

3. **A short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood:**

One crisp autumn morning, the three little pigs—Piggy, Piggles, and Puddles—were strolling through the Whispering Woods on their way to the market. They had just finished building their new homes: a sturdy brick house, a cozy straw cottage, and a cleverly designed house of sticks.

As they passed a sun-dappled clearing, they heard a soft voice calling, “Hello? Is anyone there?”

It was Little Red Riding Hood, her basket of goodies spilling slightly as she paused to catch her breath. “Oh! I’m lost,” she said, clutching her red hood. “I was bringing soup to my grandmother, but the path split and I took the wrong one.”

Piggy, the eldest, stepped forward. “Don’t worry, Red! We know these woods well. We’ll help you find your way.”

Piggles, the middle pig, added, “And we’ve got a map! We made it after the big wolf scare last spring.”

Puddles, the youngest, offered her a warm apple from his pocket. “Here, you look tired.”

Together, they walked through the forest, sharing stories and laughter. Along the way, they spotted a suspiciously large footprint near a tree. Red gasped. “That’s the wolf’s paw!”

The pigs exchanged glances. “We’ve seen that before,” said Piggy. “But this time, we’re not alone.”

They worked together: Piggles used his stick house as a lookout tower, Puddles set up a clever trap with a net and a basket of apples, and Red cleverly distracted the wolf by pretending to be a woodcutter’s daughter.

When the wolf tried to sneak up, the net snapped shut! “You’re not fooling anyone,” said Red, grinning. “We’ve been expecting you.”

With the wolf safely caught (and later released after a stern talking-to), the group arrived at Grandma’s cottage. She was delighted to see her granddaughter—and even more surprised to meet the three clever pigs.

From that day on, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became the most unlikely but best of friends. They even started a forest patrol, protecting the woods from troublemakers—because as they said, “Together, we’re stronger than any wolf.”

And so, in the heart of the Whispering Woods, a new legend began: *The Three Pigs and the Girl in Red.* [end of text]
