In this scenario, Bob's description of his meal is quite confusing and seems to be a nonsensical combination of ingredients. Let's break down what he said:

- "Aged organic milk": This is unusual because milk is typically not aged like cheese. Aged milk might refer to something like buttermilk or kefir, but it's not clear.
- "Tossed over seasoned tomato purée": This suggests that the milk was somehow mixed with or poured over tomato purée, which is not a typical combination.
- "Spread on baked whole wheat": This part is also confusing because whole wheat is usually in the form of bread or flour, not something you spread on.

Given the nonsensical nature of the description, it's likely that Bob was joking or being sarcastic. When Alice asks to see the photo, Bob sends her something that probably looks strange or unappetizing, leading Alice to react with "wtf."

### Was it healthy?
Based on the description, it's hard to determine if what Bob ate was healthy. The combination of ingredients doesn't make sense in a typical culinary context, so it's possible that Bob was just making up a ridiculous meal. If he actually ate something, it might not have been healthy due to the unusual and potentially unpalatable combination of ingredients.

### Conclusion
Bob likely sent Alice a photo of something that looked bizarre or unappetizing, leading to her reaction of "wtf." The meal he described was probably a joke or a nonsensical combination of ingredients, making it difficult to assess its healthiness. [end of text]
