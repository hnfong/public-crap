Here is a review of the text, identifying grammar mistakes (especially tense and agreement issues), serious stylistic issues, and other problems — with at least five issues per category:

—

**Grammar Mistakes (Tense & Agreement Issues):**

1. “I can’t help but agree that he’s probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.” — “He’s” is correct, but “onto something” is a phrasal verb that doesn’t require agreement issues — however, the tense is inconsistent with the rest of the paragraph (present tense used for a past hypothetical). Should be: “I couldn’t help but agree that he was probably onto something...” to match the past context.

2. “My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic — while META and GOOG...” — “on the same line of logic” is a cliché and awkward phrasing. Grammatically, “on the same line of logic” is not standard — should be “along the same lines of logic” or “in line with the same logic.”

3. “...they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations.” — “day to day” should be hyphenated: “day-to-day.” Also, “affecting day-to-day operations” is correct, but the phrase “without really affecting” is vague and stylistically weak — not a grammar error, but a stylistic one.

4. “McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.” — “McKinsey Pichai” is a compound noun that’s grammatically incorrect. It should be “Sundar Pichai” (CEO of Google) — “McKinsey” is a consulting firm, not a person. This is a factual error, not a grammar error, but it’s a serious agreement issue — the subject “McKinsey Pichai” doesn’t exist.

5. “...the only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose.” — “they're” is correct, but “In America We Trust” is not a grammatical clause — it’s a phrase that’s not properly integrated into the sentence. The sentence structure is broken — should be: “but, given that we trust American capitalism, they’re likely to protect their golden goose.”

**Serious Stylistic Issues:**

1. “So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence...” — “basically saying” is too informal and vague. “Running story” is also vague — better to say “a recurring narrative” or “a persistent claim.”

2. “...I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.” — The phrase “at least from the capitalist perspective” is vague and unconvincing. It’s not a stylistic error per se, but it’s a weak rhetorical device — it undermines the argument’s credibility.

3. “...I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations.” — “no ounce of doubt” is a cliché and overused metaphor. It’s stylistically weak and unoriginal.

4. “...McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.” — This is a serious stylistic error — it’s a factual misrepresentation. “McKinsey Pichai” is not a real person — it’s a miscombination of names. This is not just a grammar error — it’s a factual and stylistic disaster.

5. “...it’s obvious by now, the party’s gonna end sooner or later.” — “the party’s gonna end” is too informal and colloquial for the tone of the rest of the text. It’s stylistically inconsistent with the otherwise formal, analytical tone.

—

**Other Problems (Including Tone, Logic, and Coherence):**

1. “...the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech)...” — “is operationally much smaller than general tech” is a logical contradiction — AI is not “smaller than general tech” — it’s a subset. The phrase “small pockets of AI” is also misleading — AI is not a “pocket” — it’s a major industry.

2. “...the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial 'efficiency'.” — “financial efficiency” is vague — what does it mean? It’s a buzzword without definition — this is a serious lack of clarity.

3. “...until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market)...” — “as great/shitty” is a stylistic error — it’s not grammatically correct. It should be “as good or bad as” or “as great or terrible as.”

4. “...Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance.” — “True Abundance” is not a grammatically correct phrase — it’s a stylistic error. It should be “True Abundance” is not a standard phrase — it’s a rhetorical flourish that’s not grammatically correct.

5. “...it has been a fun ride.” — This is a stylistic error — it’s too casual and emotionally detached from the rest of the text. It’s not grammatically incorrect, but it’s stylistically inconsistent with the tone of the rest of the text.

- Grammar Mistakes (Tense & Agreement): 5
- Serious Stylistic Issues: 5
