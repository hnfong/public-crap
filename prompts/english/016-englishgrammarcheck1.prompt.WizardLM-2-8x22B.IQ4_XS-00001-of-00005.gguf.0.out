Grammar Mistakes:
1. "And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers..." should be "And while this might seem an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers..." or "And while this might seem to be an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers..."
2. "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective." The phrase "onto something" is informal and may not fit the tone of the text. Consider "And while this might seem an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers, I can't help but concede that there may be some truth to it, at least from a capitalist standpoint."
3. "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic..." should be "My analysis at the time was precisely along the same lines of logic..." to maintain consistency in tense.
4. "...it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down." The phrase "before things break down" is vague. Consider "before those monopolies are challenged or dismantled."
5. "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." This sentence has a tense inconsistency. It should be "And as we saw with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai was definitely ready to do whatever pleased the shareholders in this regard."

Stylistic Issues:
1. The text contains several instances of colloquial language ("So there's a running story," "I can't help but agree," "I had no ounce of doubt") which may not be appropriate for a formal analysis.
2. The use of parentheses for asides (e.g., "(who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking)," "(and particularly GOOG)," "(In America We Trust)") can be distracting and disrupt the flow of the text. Consider integrating these thoughts into the main text or omitting them if they are not essential.
3. The phrase "predatory capitalist attitude" is loaded and may come across as biased. Consider a more neutral term if the goal is to maintain objectivity.
4. The text switches between discussing the tech industry as a whole and personal anecdotes, which can be jarring. It would benefit from a clearer distinction between industry analysis and personal opinion.
5. The use of "gonna" and "shitty" in "the party's gonna end sooner or later" and "product enshittification" is informal and may not be suitable for the intended audience.

Other Problems:
1. The text lacks a clear thesis or central argument, which makes it difficult for the reader to understand the main point.
2. The author's personal financial strategy is introduced without context, which may confuse readers who are expecting a continued analysis of the tech industry.
3. The text assumes the reader has a certain level of knowledge about the tech industry, specific companies, and economic principles, which could alienate readers who are less familiar with these topics.
4. The reference to "levels.fyi" is not explained, which could leave some readers uncertain about its relevance.
5. The text ends abruptly without a conclusion or a final thought to summarize the discussion or provide closure to the reader. [end of text]
