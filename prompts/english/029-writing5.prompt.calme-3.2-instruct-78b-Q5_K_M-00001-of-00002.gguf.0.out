In a bustling city, not so different from Hong Kong, there's a high school named after a great oak, Oakwood High. Amongst the students, a 16-year-old, Lin, was not your typical teenager. Lin had a secret, a secret that was as old as the trees in the ancient forest from where she came. She was a wood elf, a guardian of nature, a creature of the earth.

Every morning, before the sun fully rose, Lin would wake up in her small apartment. Her parents, who were also wood elves, had moved to the city to blend in with humans, seeking a safer life. They taught Lin to respect and protect the environment, a principle that was deeply rooted in her heart.

At school, Lin was known for her quiet nature and her love for the school's small garden. She was a good student, but her true passion was biology, where she could learn more about the plants and animals she was so familiar with in her true form. Her classmates didn't know about her secret, but they appreciated her kindness and her dedication to keeping the garden healthy.

One day, a new student, Kai, joined Oakwood High. He was curious about Lin's interest in the garden and her extensive knowledge about plants. They quickly became friends, bonding over their shared love for nature. Lin was cautious, knowing she couldn't reveal her true identity, but she felt a connection with Kai that she had never felt before.

As the school year progressed, Lin and Kai worked together on a project to expand the school garden. They spent countless hours planning, planting, and nurturing the new plants. The garden flourished under their care, and it became a place where students could relax and appreciate nature amidst the concrete jungle.

In the heart of the garden, they discovered a small, hidden grove that seemed to have a life of its own. It was a place where Lin felt most at home, a place where she could almost forget she was in a city. She felt a pull towards the grove, a pull that was both comforting and mysterious.

One evening, after everyone had left, Lin decided to visit the grove alone. As she stepped into the heart of the garden, the plants around her seemed to whisper, and the air was filled with a soft, green light. It was then that she saw a figure, a wood elf, just like her. It was her grandmother, who had come to visit her in this place of natural beauty.

"Lin," her grandmother said, "I am proud of the work you've done here. You've brought life to this garden, and you've shown others the importance of nature. Remember, your true strength lies in your ability to connect with others and to care for the world around you."

The next day, Lin shared her experience with Kai, but she didn't reveal her secret. Instead, she spoke about her love for nature and her desire to protect it. Kai listened, understanding and supportive, and they continued their work on the garden, their friendship growing stronger.

In the end, Lin's secret remained just that, a secret. But it didn't matter, for she had found a place where she could be herself, a place where she could share her love for nature, and a friend who appreciated the beauty of the world, just as she did. And in that, she found a sense of belonging, a home away from home. [end of text]
