1. You would have to count up to 100 before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number. The first number that contains the letter "A" is "one hundred" (100).

2. The sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is famous for being a pangram, which means it contains every letter of the alphabet at least once.

3. Once upon a time, in a forest not far from a village, lived three little pigs and a little red riding hood. The three little pigs built their houses, one of straw, one of sticks, and one of bricks. The little red riding hood was known for her kindness and helpfulness.

One day, a big bad wolf came to the forest. He blew down the houses of straw and sticks, but he couldn't blow down the house of bricks. The little pigs ran to the little red riding hood's house for help. She suggested they ask the wolf to play a game of chess. The wolf agreed, and the little red riding hood played a clever game, making the wolf lose.

The wolf, feeling defeated, decided to leave the forest. The little pigs and the little red riding hood celebrated their victory and lived happily ever after.

The end.
