Let's answer each question.

Let's check question 1: "How high would you have to count before you would use the letter 'A' in the English language spelling of a whole number?" We need to find the first whole number that uses letter "A" in its English spelling. Let's check: "one" no letter A, "two" no letter A, "three" no letter A, "four" no letter A, "five" no letter A, "six" no letter A, "seven" no letter A, "eight" no letter A, "nine" no letter A, "ten" no letter A, "eleven" no letter A, "twelve" no letter A, "thirteen" no letter A, "fourteen" no letter A, "fifteen" no letter A, "sixteen" no letter A, "seventeen" no letter A, "eighteen" no letter A, "nineteen" no letter A, "twenty" no letter A, "thirty" no letter A, "forty" no letter A, "fifty" no letter A, "sixty" no letter A, "seventy" no letter A, "eighty" no letter A, "ninety" no letter A, "hundred" no letter A, "thousand" no letter A, "million" no letter A, "billion" no letter A, "trillion" no letter A, "quadrillion" no letter A? Wait, check "quadrillion" has letter A? Actually "quadrillion" is spelled Q-U-A-D-R-I-L-L-I-O-N, so it has an A. But is that the first occurrence? Let's check "one hundred" no letter A, "one thousand" no letter A, "one million" no letter A, "one billion" no letter A, "one trillion" no letter A, "one quadrillion" has letter A. But wait, maybe there's a number that uses letter A earlier than quadrillion? Let's check "seventy" no letter A, "eighty" no letter A, "ninety" no letter A, "eleven" no letter A, "twelve" no letter A, "thirteen" no letter A, "fourteen" no letter A, "fifteen" no letter A, "sixteen" no letter A, "seventeen" no letter A, "eighteen" no letter A, "nineteen" no letter A, "twenty" no letter A, "thirty" no letter A, "forty" no letter A, "fifty" no letter A, "sixty" no letter A, "seventy" no letter A, "eighty" no letter A, "ninety" no letter A, "hundred" no letter A, "thousand" no letter A, "million" no letter A, "billion" no letter A, "trillion" no letter A, "quadrillion" yes letter A. But wait, what about "one hundred"? That doesn't have A. "One thousand" no letter A. "One million" no letter A. "One billion" no letter A. "One trillion" no letter A. "One quadrillion" yes letter A. But is that the first occurrence? Let's check "seventy" no letter A, "eighty" no letter A, "ninety" no letter A, "eleven" no letter A, "twelve" no letter A, "thirteen" no letter A, "fourteen" no letter A, "fifteen" no letter A, "sixteen" no letter A, "seventeen" no letter A, "eighteen" no letter A, "nineteen" no letter A, "twenty" no letter A, "thirty" no letter A, "forty" no letter A, "fifty" no letter A, "sixty" no letter A, "seventy" no letter A, "eighty" no letter A, "ninety" no letter A, "hundred" no letter A, "thousand" no letter A, "million" no letter A, "billion" no letter A, "trillion" no letter A, "quadrillion" yes letter A.
