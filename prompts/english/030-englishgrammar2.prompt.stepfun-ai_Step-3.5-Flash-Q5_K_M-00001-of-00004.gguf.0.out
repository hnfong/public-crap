Okay, let me start by looking at each sentence one by one. The user wants the English translations to be simple, fluent, and sound like a native speaker wrote them. I need to check if the original translations are correct or if they need tweaking.

First sentence: "你咁趕做咩啫，你慌人哋唔等你咩？ Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?" The original has a grammatical error—"Why are you hurry?" should be "Why are you in such a hurry?" or "Why are you hurrying?" Also, the second part is a bit awkward. Maybe combine them into one smoother question. Something like "Why are you in such a hurry? Do you think they won't wait for you?" But the Cantonese seems to imply both parts are connected. Perhaps "Why are you rushing? Are you worried they won't wait?" That sounds more natural.

Second sentence: "佢份人夠大量，唔同班𡃁仔計較。 He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids." The translation is okay, but "magnanimous" might be too formal. "Generous" or "big-hearted" could be simpler. Also, "haggle over trivial issues" is a bit wordy. Maybe "He's generous and doesn't argue with the kids over small things." Or "He's big-hearted and doesn't bother with the kids' trivialities." But the original uses "haggle," which might not fit kids. "Argue" or "bicker" could be better. Let me think... "He's a generous person and doesn't argue with the kids over little things." That sounds more natural.

Third sentence: "學語文冇捷徑，要靠大量浸淫。 There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it." The phrase "massive exposure" is okay, but "immersion" is more common when talking about language learning. Also, "to learn" should be "to learning" or rephrased. Maybe "There's no shortcut to learning a language; you need to immerse yourself in it." Or "Learning a language has no shortcuts—it requires a lot of immersion." The original translation is a bit stiff. "Immersion" is the key term here.

Fourth sentence: "小新喺同事面前讚美女朋友有幾温柔。 Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender." "Tender" might not be the best word here. "Gentle" or "kind" is more common for describing a person. Also, the structure is a bit clunky. "Siu-san praises his girlfriend's gentleness in front of his colleagues." Or "Siu-san tells his colleagues how gentle his girlfriend is." The original says "for her being very tender," which is awkward. Better to say "how gentle she is."

Fifth sentence: "我日日都搭地鐵返學。 I take the metro to school every day." This one seems fine. It's simple and correct. No changes needed.

Wait, let me double-check each one. For the first, maybe combine into one sentence: "Why are you in such a hurry? Are you worried they won't wait?" But the Cantonese has two clauses, so keeping two sentences might be okay. Alternatively, "Why are you rushing? Do you think they won't wait for you?" That flows better.

Second: "He's generous and doesn't argue with the kids over small things." Yes, that's simpler.

Third: "There's no shortcut to learning a language; you need a lot of immersion." Or "Learning a language requires immersion—there are no shortcuts." But the original structure is fine with a tweak: "There's no shortcut to learning a language; it requires extensive immersion."

Fourth: "Siu-san praises his girlfriend's gentleness in front of his colleagues." Or "Siu-san tells his colleagues how gentle his girlfriend is." The latter is more active.

Fifth: Already good.

So, summarizing:

1. Change to "Why are you in such a hurry? Are you worried they won't wait for you?" or similar.
2. Change to "He's generous and doesn't argue with the kids over small things."
3. Change to "There's no shortcut to learning a language; it requires extensive immersion."
4. Change to "Siu-san tells his colleagues how gentle his girlfriend is."
5. Keep as is.

I think that covers it. Let me write the final suggestions.
