1. The main thesis is that suffering and evil are not objective features of the world but rather subjective experiences we choose to create through our own beliefs and perspectives, and that God (as a universal creative force) creates everything, including our own subjective experiences.

2. I don't fully agree. While the text raises interesting points about perception, it seems to dismiss genuine suffering and the legitimate moral concerns of those experiencing real hardship. It risks blaming victims for their own suffering by suggesting it's "chosen," which can be harmful and ignores structural causes of suffering that exist independently of individual belief.

3. Here's a short poem:

> We are the vessels, the qualia's seam,  
> Creating our worlds through thought's fleeting dream.  
> What seems like evil, like suffering and pain,  
> Is but the reflection of our chosen terrain.  

> If suffering lingers where you happen to be,  
> Remember—you chose this; you're always set free.  
> Shift not your body, but shift how you see,  
> And change your experience, and set your mind free.  

> Yet some cry for help through their anguish and night—  
> Perhaps it's not choice, but a genuine fight.  
> For love isn't ego, but nurture and care,  
> To hold those who suffer—God's presence is there. [end of text]
