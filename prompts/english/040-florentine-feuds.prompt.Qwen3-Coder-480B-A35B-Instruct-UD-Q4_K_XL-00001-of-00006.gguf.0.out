Marco faces a classic dilemma of Renaissance Florentine politics, where personal survival and success depended on navigating complex webs of loyalty and patronage. His most strategically prudent course of action would be to **approach the Albizzi directly about the lapis lazuli requirement, framing it as an opportunity rather than a problem**.

Here's why this approach serves his interests under Renaissance norms:

## Leveraging *Clientela* Properly

Marco should present himself as the perfect intermediary who can secure this rare material through his professional networks, without explicitly revealing Medici involvement. This positions him as a valuable *cliens* who brings solutions, not problems, to his patrons. The Albizzi commissioned the work knowing the material's source - they likely expect Marco to handle the delicate procurement professionally.

## Demonstrating *Virtù*

By taking initiative and presenting a strategic solution, Marco displays *virtù* - the Renaissance ideal of personal excellence and capability. He shows he can navigate Florence's complex political landscape while serving his patrons' interests. This enhances his reputation as a skilled artisan who can deliver results even under difficult circumstances.

## Protecting *Reputazione*

The key is transparency about the *necessity* while maintaining discretion about the *method*. Marco should explain that this particular lapis lazuli is essential for the commission's quality and that he has professional contacts who can source it. He avoids mentioning Medici involvement specifically, thus not appearing to betray the Albizzi while also not lying about his actual procurement methods.

## Strategic Implementation

Marco should:
- Emphasize his unique ability to secure premium materials
- Present the procurement as part of his professional expertise
- Suggest that such high-quality work requires equally exceptional materials
- Frame any additional costs as investment in the commission's excellence

This approach allows Marco to fulfill his commission, maintain his professional integrity, and preserve relationships with both families while demonstrating the very qualities that made artisans valuable in Renaissance society: skill, discretion, and the ability to deliver results within complex political realities.
