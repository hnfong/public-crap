The sentence is: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." It is famous for being a **pangram**, meaning it contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once.

3. **Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.**  

Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who built their homes close to each other. The first pig, who was a bit lazy, built his house out of straw. The second pig, who was a little more hardworking, built his house out of sticks. The third pig, who was the hardest working and smartest, built his house out of bricks.  

One sunny day, the three pigs heard a knock at their door. It was their friend, Little Red Riding Hood, who was carrying a basket of goodies for her grandmother. "Hello, brothers!" she said. "My grandmother is feeling sick, and I thought I'd check on her. Can I stay with you for a while?"  

The first two pigs were happy to let her stay, but the third pig, Gruff, warned her, "Be careful, Little Red. You should always check where you're going."  

Later that afternoon, a sly wolf with big, shiny eyes came sniffing around. He heard about the pigs and their guest. He knocked on the straw house door and said, "Little Red Riding Hood, little Red Riding Hood, let me in!"  

But Little Red had remembered her father's warning. She told the wolf she couldn't let him in unless her mother was there. The wolf pretended to go away, but as soon as he turned back, he huffed and puffed, and the straw house collapsed. The wolf rushed into the house and found the first pig. "Little Red Riding Hood, where are you?" he growled.  

But before the wolf could catch him, Little Red Riding Hood arrived with her basket. She shouted, "Wolf, you can't eat me now because I have something for you!" She threw the basket of goodies into the wolf's mouth, and he couldn't move.  

The wolf huffed and puffed again, but this time the stick house collapsed too. The wolf rushed into the second house and found the second pig. "Little Red Riding Hood, where are you?" he growled.  

But again, Little Red Riding Hood arrived just in time. She threw another basket of goodies into the wolf's mouth, and he couldn't move.  

The wolf huffed and puffed one more time, and this time the brick house began to shake. The third pig, Gruff, came out of the house and said, "Wolf, you can't eat my brother!" The wolf huffed and puffed so hard that he blew the house down, but he couldn't reach the pigs.  

The three pigs and Little Red Riding Hood worked together to scare the wolf away. From that day on, they all lived happily together, knowing that working hard and being prepared could protect them from trouble.  

And so, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became the best of friends.
