What a delightful passage!

After carefully reading the text, I'm going to take a guess that this article was written on April 1st. Yes, you read that right - April 1st, also known as April Fool's Day.

My reasoning is based on the hint that the writing style is connected to a particular day and month of the year. The text has a distinctive tone that is overly dramatic, slightly sarcastic, and playfully provocative. The author seems to be poking fun at the Rust community, while also expressing a contrarian view about the language. The text is full of tongue-in-cheek comments, such as the author's confidence in their ability to avoid writing code with safety problems, the downplaying of memory safety issues, and the criticism of the Rust community's code of conduct.

The writing style is reminiscent of an April Fool's Day joke, where the author is trying to elicit a reaction from the reader by presenting a outrageous or humorous opinion. The fact that the author is announcing a switch from Rust to C++ and inviting people to join their Zulip instance to help with the rewrite seems like a clever ruse to get a rise out of the Rust community.

Furthermore, the text contains some red flags that suggest it might be a joke, such as the author's claim that they can avoid writing code with safety problems, which is a notoriously difficult task, even for experienced programmers. The author's dismissal of the Rust community's concerns about safety and their criticism of the community's code of conduct also seem like exaggerated or straw man arguments.

Overall, while it's possible that the author is genuinely expressing their opinions, the tone and style of the text suggest that it's an April Fool's Day joke. Therefore, my best guess is that this article was written on April 1st. [end of text]
