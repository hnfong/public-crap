Here are the answers to your questions:

**1. How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?**

You would have to count to "One Thousand" before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number.

**2. Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox ..."; What is the sentence famous for?**

The complete sentence is: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

This sentence is famous for being a pangram, a sentence that uses all the letters of the alphabet at least once. It is often used as a demonstration of a font or keyboard's capabilities.

**3. Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.**

Once upon a time, in a sunny meadow, the three little pigs were busy building their new homes. The first little pig, being a bit lazy, built his house out of straw. The second little pig, being a bit more ambitious, built his house out of sticks. And the third little pig, being the most ambitious of all, built his house out of bricks.

Just as they were finishing up, a little girl in a red hooded cloak came walking by. "Hello there, little pigs!" she said with a smile. "My name is Little Red Riding Hood. I'm on my way to visit my grandmother who lives in a cozy cottage just through the woods."

The three little pigs were delighted to meet Little Red Riding Hood and offered to walk with her to her grandmother's house. As they strolled through the woods, they chatted about their homes and their favorite foods (the pigs loved to eat acorns, while Little Red Riding Hood loved to eat cookies).

When they arrived at Grandmother's house, they found that the Big Bad Wolf had been there before them. But the wolf had been thwarted by the three little pigs' cleverness and Little Red Riding Hood's quick thinking. Together, they chased the wolf away and had a lovely tea party with Grandmother.

From that day on, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became the best of friends and had many more exciting adventures together. [end of text]
