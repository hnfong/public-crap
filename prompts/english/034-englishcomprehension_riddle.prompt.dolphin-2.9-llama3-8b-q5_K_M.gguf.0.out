Consider this scenario:

Alice: Are you eating healthy?
Bob: Yes! Today I ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat.
Alice: Wow! Let me see.
Bob: (sends Alice a photo)
Alice: wtf

---
Question: what happened? What did Bob eat and was it healthy?

Bob ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat. It can be considered healthy as it consists of organic milk, tomatoes, and whole wheat, which are all nutritious ingredients. However, the term "wtf" from Alice's response suggests that the dish's appearance or presentation might have been surprising or unappealing to her.
