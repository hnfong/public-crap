Here are the answers to your questions:

### 1. The First Number with "A"
You would have to count to **one thousand** (1,000) before you use the letter "A" in the English spelling of a whole number.

*   **Reasoning:** The numbers from one to nine hundred ninety-nine do not contain the letter "A". The word "one" through "nine" have no "a". "Ten" through "nineteen" have no "a". "Twenty" through "ninety" have no "a". "Hundred" has no "a".
*   The first number to include "A" is **one thousand** (or simply **thousand**).
    *   *Note:* Some might argue for "and" (e.g., "one hundred **and** one"), but in standard American English usage for whole numbers, "and" is often omitted. Even if "and" is included, the word "and" contains an "a", but the question usually refers to the specific number words themselves. However, strictly speaking, the word "thousand" is the first number word containing the letter "A".
    *   *Correction/Refinement:* Actually, the word **"thousand"** contains an "a". But wait, let's check the sequence again.
    *   One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, hundred.
    *   None of these contain "a".
    *   The next number is **one thousand**. The word "thousand" contains an "a".
    *   Therefore, the answer is **1,000**.

*(Self-Correction: Is there any number before 1,000? No. "Hundred" has no 'a'. "Thousand" is the first.)*

### 2. The Quick Brown Fox
**Completed Sentence:** "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."

**Famous For:** This sentence is famous for being a **pangram**. A pangram is a sentence that uses every letter of the alphabet at least once. It is widely used to test typewriters, computer keyboards, and fonts to ensure all characters are functioning correctly.

### 3. The Three Little Pigs and Little Red Riding Hood

Once upon a time, in a forest that smelled faintly of pine and danger, the Three Little Pigs were building their homes. The first built a house of straw, the second of sticks, and the third of bricks.

As the third pig was laying the final brick, a small girl in a red hood approached. She was carrying a basket of goodies for her grandmother.

"Hello there," said the girl, her voice trembling slightly. "I am Little Red Riding Hood. I am on my way to visit my grandmother, but the woods are very dark."

The third pig, who was the most sensible of the bunch, stepped forward. "You are in luck, Miss Hood. My brothers and I are building a very sturdy house. It is made of brick, and it is safe from wolves."

Just then, a low growl echoed through the trees. The Big Bad Wolf had found them. He sniffed the air, his eyes gleaming. "Aha! A little girl and three pigs! A feast for one!"

The wolf huffed and puffed at the straw house, blowing it down instantly. The first pig ran to the stick house. The wolf huffed and puffed again, and the stick house crumbled. The first pig ran to the brick house, followed closely by the second pig.

Little Red Riding Hood hid behind the brick wall, clutching her basket. The wolf approached the brick house, puffing his cheeks. "I will blow your house down!" he roared.

He huffed. He puffed. He blew until his face turned purple, but the brick house stood firm. The pigs and the girl watched from the window.

"Fine," the wolf grumbled, his breath coming in ragged gasps. "If I cannot blow you down, I will climb down the chimney!"

The third pig, thinking quickly, lit a large fire in the hearth and placed a pot of boiling water on top. When the wolf slid down the chimney, he landed right into the hot water with a yelp of surprise. He scrambled up the chimney, jumped out the window, and ran away into the deep woods, never to bother the pigs or the girl again.

Little Red Riding Hood smiled, her fear gone. "Thank you, Mr. Pig," she said. "Your house is the safest in the forest."

And so, the Three Little Pigs and Little Red Riding Hood shared a warm meal together, safe and sound, proving that sometimes, the best defense is a little bit of brick and a lot of friendship. [end of text]
