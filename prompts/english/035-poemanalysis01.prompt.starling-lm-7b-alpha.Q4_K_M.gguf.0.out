The comment you provided appears to be a creative and somewhat humorous take on the concept of Mario, a popular video game character, slipping and falling into an abyss due to the inertia of running. Here are some interpretations and explanations of the comment:

1. The phrase "inertia of running" could be interpreted as the force that keeps Mario moving forward while running. Inertia is a property of matter by which it retains its state of rest or its velocity along a straight line so long as it is not acted upon by an external force. In this context, it seems to suggest that Mario's momentum while running is causing him to slip and fall.

2. "Makes Mario slip" is a reference to Mario, the main character of the popular video game series created by Nintendo. The comment seems to be suggesting that the inertia of running is causing Mario to lose his footing and slip.

3. "Into the abyss" is a metaphorical expression that could refer to a difficult or dangerous situation. In this context, it seems to suggest that Mario's slip is causing him to fall into a challenging or perilous circumstance.

4. "Skill issue" is a humorous and somewhat sarcastic way of saying that Mario's slip is due to a lack of skill or ability. This phrase is often used in gaming communities to dismiss a player's poor performance as a result of their own lack of skill, rather than external factors such as game mechanics or design.

Overall, the comment seems to be a lighthearted and creative take on the concept of Mario slipping and falling due to the inertia of running, with a touch of humor and sarcasm.
