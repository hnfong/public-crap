The most beautiful rainbow I've ever seen was over the Lake District. It was a lovely summer's day, but the sun was hiding behind the clouds. Suddenly, a big storm rolled in and the rain started pouring down. But then, something magical happened.

The sun came out from behind the clouds and shone through the raindrops in the air. Oh, what a sight! A beautiful rainbow stretched across the sky, its colours shining bright and bold. The red was like a juicy strawberry, the orange was like a slice of juicy orange, and the yellow was like a happy smile.

The green was like a fresh meadow, the blue was like a sparkling lake, and the violet was like a sweet, fragrant flower. The rainbow was so big and wide, it seemed to touch the mountains and the trees. I felt like I was walking on sunshine, with the rainbow leading the way. It was a truly magical moment, and I felt so lucky to have seen it. [end of text]
