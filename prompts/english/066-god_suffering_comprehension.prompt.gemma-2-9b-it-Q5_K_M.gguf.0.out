Here are my responses to your questions:

1. **Main Thesis:** The text argues that suffering and evil are subjective experiences we choose to perceive, rather than objective realities imposed upon us. It posits that we are vessels for experiencing God's creation, and our individual choices shape our reality, including the presence of suffering. Ultimately, the text suggests that we have the power to change our experiences by altering our beliefs and perspectives.

2. **Agreement:** I find the text's perspective thought-provoking but ultimately unconvincing. While I agree that our perceptions and beliefs influence our experiences, I believe that external factors and systemic issues contribute significantly to suffering.  To solely attribute suffering to individual choice ignores the complexities of human existence and the realities of injustice and hardship faced by many.

3. **Poem:**

Within a world of God's design,
We choose the lens through which we shine.
Suffering's grip, a phantom's hold,
A story told, a truth unfold.

Our minds create, our hearts perceive,
The world we see, we help conceive.
Though darkness looms, and shadows fall,
The power to choose, resides in all.
