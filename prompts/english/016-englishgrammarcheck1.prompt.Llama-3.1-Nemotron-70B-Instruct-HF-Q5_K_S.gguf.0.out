So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

Here are the identified issues in the requested format, with at least 5 points in each category:

**Grammar Mistakes (especially tense and "agreement" issues)**

1. **Tense Inconsistency**: The text switches between past and present tense, e.g., "I briefly wondered" (past) and "it seems their monopolies are still functional" (present). Try to maintain a consistent tense throughout.
2. **Subject-Verb Agreement**: "people... who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking" should be "people... whom I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking" (object pronoun 'whom' instead of 'who').
3. **Missing Article**: "in particular META and GOOG" should be "in particular, Meta and Google (GOOG)" (added article 'a' or 'the' for clarity, and full company name for initial mention).
4. **Pronoun Ambiguity**: "they can always layoff more people... and increase margins and profit" - unclear who "they" refers to; specify the subject (e.g., "these companies").
5. **Double Negation**: "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations" is a bit confusing; consider rephrasing for clarity (e.g., "I was confident they could cut costs...").

**Serious Stylistic Issues**

1. **Tone Inconsistency**: The text veers between analytical, sarcastic ("McKinsey Pichai"), and introspective tones. Try to maintain a consistent tone or clearly signal shifts.
2. **Jargon and Assumed Knowledge**: Terms like "levels.fyi", "FI" (Financial Independence), and "enshittification" might alienate unfamiliar readers. Consider brief explanations or alternative phrasing.
3. **Sentence Length and Complexity**: Some sentences are overly long and convoluted, hindering readability. Break up complex sentences into simpler ones.
4. **Transitions and Connections**: The text jumps between ideas (e.g., from Andreessen Horowitz to personal financial planning). Use transitional phrases to guide the reader.
5. **Conclusory Remarks**: The final sentence ("But I always knew we're in a state of flux.") feels somewhat disconnected from the preceding discussion. Ensure concluding remarks effectively summarize or tie together the main points.

**Other Problems**

1. **Lack of Clear Structure**: The text doesn't follow a clear introduction-body-conclusion format. Organize the content to facilitate easier comprehension.
2. **Unsubstantiated Claims**: Assertions like "tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift" could benefit from supporting evidence or examples.
3. **Overreliance on Colloquialisms**: Phrases like "the party's gonna end sooner or later" may not translate well across cultures or professional contexts. Balance colloquialisms with more formal language.
4. **Potential Libel/Defamation**: Referring to Sundar Pichai as "McKinsey Pichai" could be perceived as derogatory. Ensure criticism is constructive and respectful.
5. **Missing Context for Unfamiliar Readers**: The text assumes readers are familiar with the initial "running story" about Andreessen Horowitz. Provide brief context for those who may not be aware of the reference. [end of text]
