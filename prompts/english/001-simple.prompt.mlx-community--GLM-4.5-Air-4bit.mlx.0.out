### 1. How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?

The first time the letter "A" appears in the spelling of a whole number is in **one thousand** (1,000). 

- All numbers from 1 to 999 do not contain the letter "A". For example:
  - 1: "one"
  - 10: "ten"
  - 100: "one hundred"
  - 999: "nine hundred ninety-nine"
- The next number, 1,000, is spelled "one thousand", which includes the letter "A".

So, you would have to count to **1,000** before encountering the letter "A".

###  Practical Pig, who had built his house of bricks, was enjoying a quiet morning when he heard a knock at the door. It was Little Red Riding Hood, carrying a basket of goodies for her grandmother. "Hello there," she said cheerfully. "I'm on my way through the forest to visit my sick grandma. Would you like some of these delicious apples and honey cakes?"

Practical Pig, ever cautious, eyed the basket suspiciously. "Apples and honey cakes, eh? Sounds like a wolf might be hiding behind them. You should be careful, young lady."

Just then, the Big Bad Wolf himself appeared at the edge of the woods, licking his chops. "Well, well, what have we here?" he growled. "Two tasty treats in one place!"

Practical Pig quickly slammed his brick door shut. "Get back, wolf! You won't catch me or my friend here!"

Little Red Riding Hood, though frightened, had a clever idea. She tossed an apple from her basket toward the wolf. "Here, wolfy! Catch!" she called out. As the wolf lunged for the apple, Practical Pig burst out of his house and gave the wolf a mighty shove, sending him tumbling into a nearby thorny bush.

The wolf yelped in pain and fled, vowing revenge. Practical Pig and Little Red Riding Hood breathed a sigh of relief. "You saved me!" exclaimed Red. "And you're very brave!"

Practical Pig smiled. "Brave or not, I'm not letting a wolf ruin my day—or yours. Now, how about those honey cakes? They do look rather good."

And so, the three little pigs (who had gathered to hear the tale) and Little Red Riding Hood shared a sweet breakfast, wiser and safer for the adventure.</think>### 1. How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?

You would have to count to **1,000** (one thousand) before encountering the letter "A" in the English spelling of a whole number. Here's why:

- All numbers from 1 to 999 are spelled without the letter "A". For example:
  - 1: "one"
  - 10: "ten"
  - 100: "one hundred"
  - 999: "nine hundred ninety-nine"
- The number 1,000 is spelled "one thousand", which contains the letter "A".

Thus, 1,000 is the first whole number where the letter "A" appears in its English spelling.

The complete sentence is:  
**"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."**

This sentence is famous because it is a **pangram**—a sentence that contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once. Pangrams are commonly used to:
- Test fonts and typography (ensuring all letters are displayed correctly).
- Practice typing skills (e.g., in typing tutorials).
- Verify keyboard functionality (e.g., checking for stuck keys).

### 3. Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.

One sunny morning, the three little pigs—Practical, Lazy, and Foolish—were gathered at Practical’s sturdy brick house. They were sipping tea and debating the merits of building materials when a knock echoed at the door. There stood Little Red Riding Hood, her basket laden with apples and honey cakes.  

"Hello!" she chirped. "I’m visiting Grandma through the forest. Would you like some treats?"  

Lazy Pig’s eyes lit up. "Ooh, honey cakes!" he drooled, reaching for the basket.  

But Practical Pig blocked him. "Wait! The Big Bad Wolf roams these parts. He might be lurking nearby."  

Just then, the Wolf’s shadow fell over the doorway. "Well, well," he snarled, "if it isn’t the three little pigs—and a little snack in red!"  

Practical Pig slammed the door shut. "Bricks, remember? You’ll never huff this down!"  

The Wolf growled, but Red Riding Hood had a plan. She tossed an apple past him. "Wolfy, catch!" As he lunged, Practical Pig burst out and shoved him into a thorny bush. The Wolf yelped and fled, vowing revenge.  

Red sighed in relief. "You saved us!"  

Practical Pig grinned. "Bricks and teamwork—that’s the real fairy tale lesson."  

And so, the pigs and Red Riding Hood shared honey cakes, wiser and safer for the adventure. The Wolf, nursing scratches, skulked away, knowing he’d met his match.
