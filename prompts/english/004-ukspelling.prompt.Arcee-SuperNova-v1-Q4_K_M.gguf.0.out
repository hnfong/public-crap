The rainbows I love the most are the ones that appear after a spring shower. You know, when the sun peeks out from behind a big, fluffy cloud and paints a beautiful arc of colours across the sky.

I like to imagine that the rainbow is a magical bridge, stretching from the earth to the heavens. The colours are so vivid and bright â€“ red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. It's like a big, colourful smile in the sky.

Sometimes, if I'm lucky, I'll spot a double rainbow. That's when a second, fainter arc appears outside the first one. It's like a secret message from the sky, just for me.

Rainbows make me feel happy and hopeful. They remind me that even on grey, rainy days, something beautiful is just around the corner. So, next time you spot a rainbow, take a moment to stop and admire its beauty. You never know, it might just make your day a little bit brighter! [end of text]
