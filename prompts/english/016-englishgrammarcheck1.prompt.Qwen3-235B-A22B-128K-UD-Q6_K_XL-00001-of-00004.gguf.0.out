Here is a review of your text, focusing on **grammar**, **tense and agreement issues**, and **serious stylistic problems**, as requested. Minor stylistic or sentence structure issues (e.g., word choice, awkward phrasing, or punctuation) are not included unless they significantly affect clarity or correctness.

### üîç **Grammar Mistakes**

1. **"I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs..."**  
   - *Issue:* Mixed tense. "Can" should be "could" to match the past-tense context of "I had no doubt."

2. **"Those who read history knows"**  
   - *Issue:* Subject-verb disagreement. "Knows" should be "know" to agree with the plural subject "those."

3. **"The party's gonna end sooner or later."**  
   - *Issue:* Informal contraction "gonna" is inappropriate in formal or semi-formal writing. Not a grammar error per se, but a stylistic inconsistency.

4. **"Saving up for 'FI' isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here)..."**  
   - *Issue:* The parenthetical sentence fragment "there's actually no tech jobs here" contains a subject-verb agreement error: "jobs" is plural, so "is" should be "are."

5. **"my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses"**  
   - *Issue:* "Stack" is singular, but the verb "uses" refers to "nobody," which is singular, so this is grammatically okay. However, the phrasing is vague and could be misinterpreted. A clearer version would be "a stack that nobody in their right mind uses."

### ‚è≥ **Tense and Agreement Issues**

1. **"My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable..."**  
   - *Issue:* Shift from past tense ("was") to present tense ("don't seem") without justification. Should be "didn't seem" to maintain consistency.

2. **"I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices..."**  
   - *Issue:* Mixed tense. "Would be" should be "would have been" to reflect the past hypothetical nature of the thought.

3. **"I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective."**  
   - *Issue:* The phrase "he's probably onto something" is present tense, but the context implies a past opinion or a general ongoing one. If referring to a specific past statement, tense should be consistent.

4. **"The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough..."**  
   - *Issue:* "In America We Trust" is a stylistic play on "In God We Trust," but it's not properly integrated into the sentence and creates a grammatical mismatch. Also, "they're" is present tense, while the earlier part of the sentence is in past tense.

5. **"I always knew we're in a state of flux."**  
   - *Issue:* Mixed tense. "Knew" is past tense, but "we're" is present. Should be "we were" to maintain tense agreement.

### üñãÔ∏è **Serious Stylistic Issues**

1. **Inconsistent tone and register**  
   - The text alternates between formal economic analysis and very informal expressions like "gonna," "funny stack," and "enshittification." This creates a jarring effect and undermines the credibility of the argument.

2. **Use of slang and internet jargon**  
   - Phrases like "enshittification" and "McKinsey Pichai" are informal and may not be widely understood. While they may be clever or ironic, they can confuse readers unfamiliar with the terms.

3. **Overuse of parentheticals and asides**  
   - The frequent use of parentheses and informal interjections (e.g., "we're still sane though, just unique circumstances") disrupts the flow and makes the writing feel disorganized.

4. **Unexplained references**  
   - Terms like "FI" (Financial Independence), "levels.fyi," and "McKinsey Pichai" are not explained, which may alienate readers unfamiliar with these concepts or inside jokes.

5. **Hyperbolic and emotionally charged language**  
   - Phrases like "predatory capitalist attitude," "revolutionary tech," and "crash and burn" are emotionally loaded and may detract from the analytical tone the writer seems to be aiming for.

### üß† **Other Serious Issues**

1. **Logical inconsistency in time references**  
   - The writer refers to past analysis and present logic, but the timeline of when each thought occurred is unclear, making the argument harder to follow.

2. **Ambiguous use of "he"**  
   - The first paragraph mentions Andreessen Horowitz, but later refers to "he's probably onto something." It's unclear whether "he" refers to Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz, or someone else, especially since Andreessen Horowitz is a firm, not a single person.

3. **Misuse of economic terminology**  
   - Phrases like "True Abundance" and "enshittification" are used without clear definitions or context, which weakens the analytical strength of the piece.

4. **Overgeneralization**  
   - Statements like "every
