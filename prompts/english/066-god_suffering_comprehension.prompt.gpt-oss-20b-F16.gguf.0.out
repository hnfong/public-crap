<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer three questions. The text is about God, suffering, subjective experience, agency, etc. The main thesis: God creates everything, humans are vessels experiencing God's creation; suffering is a subjective choice/experience; we have agency to choose how we perceive suffering. The author says suffering is a personal choice, not objective. So main thesis: God is all-encompassing, humans experience subjective reality; suffering is a result of our choices and perceptions, not inherent. Provide 3 sentences max.

Second: Do you agree? Explain concisely. As ChatGPT, we can express a balanced view: I don't fully agree; suffering exists objectively; but perception matters. Provide concise explanation.

Third: Write a short rhyming poem based on the information above. Provide a poem.

Let's craft.

<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**1. Main thesis (≤ 3 sentences)**  
God is an all‑encompassing creative force that sustains everything, and humans are vessels that experience this creation through subjective qualia.  
Our perception of suffering and evil is largely a personal choice—what we choose to notice, believe, and give meaning to.  
Thus, while the world contains pain, the way we experience and interpret it is determined by our own agency and perspective.  

**2. Do I agree?**  
I partially agree: the idea that our subjective lens shapes how we experience suffering is compelling, yet it underestimates that suffering can have objective, systemic causes that affect many regardless of individual perception.  

**3. Short rhyming poem**

In God’s vast loom, all threads are spun,  
We drink the weave, each soul a one‑ton.  
Suffering’s shadow, a choice we cast,  
In the light of mind, it’s made to last.  

We hold the power to see or hide,  
In every breath, our truth resides.  
So choose the path where love may grow,  
And let the darkness ebb and flow. [end of text]
