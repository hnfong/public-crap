<|channel|>analysis<|message|>We need to answer three questions. The text is about God, suffering, subjective experience, agency, etc. The main thesis: The author argues that suffering and evil are subjective experiences created by our choices and perceptions; God creates everything, but we choose how to experience it; we have agency; suffering is not objective but a result of our perspective. So we need to explain main thesis in at most 3 sentences.

Second: Do you agree? Explain concisely. As ChatGPT, we can express a neutral stance: I can say I find the argument interesting but not fully convincing; I can say I partially agree that perception shapes experience but suffering has objective aspects. Provide concise explanation.

Third: Write a short poem that rhymes based on the information above. Should be short, rhyming. Let's produce maybe 8-12 lines. Use some of the concepts: God as law, subjective experience, agency, choice, suffering. Provide rhyme scheme maybe AABB or ABAB.

Let's craft.

Also note: The user might want a poem that rhymes. Provide a short poem.

Let's produce final answer.<|start|>assistant<|channel|>final<|message|>**1. Main thesis (≤ 3 sentences)**  
God is the all‑encompassing creative law that produces everything, and every being is a vessel that chooses how to experience that creation.  
Our suffering and sense of evil arise not from an objective reality but from the limited, subjective perspective we adopt—our own choices of belief, attention, and interpretation.  
Thus, agency is real: by changing our perspective we can alter the suffering we feel, even though the world itself remains unchanged.

**2. Do I agree?**  
I find the idea that perception shapes experience compelling, but I also think that some forms of suffering (e.g., physical pain, injustice) have objective, measurable effects that cannot be entirely dismissed as mere choice.  
So I partially agree: our agency can mitigate but not entirely eliminate the reality of suffering.

**3. Short rhyming poem**

In God’s vast law we’re vessels cast,  
A world of light and shadows vast.  
We choose the lens through which we see—  
The pain we feel, the joy we be.  

Suffering, a choice of mind,  
Not a law that fate has signed.  
Yet still the world can bruise and break,  
And we must learn to heal and take.  

So turn the gaze, let love be found,  
In every breath, in every sound.  
For agency lies within our hand—  
To shape the world we understand. [end of text]
