Here are a couple sentences in both Cantonese and English. They are written by somebody who is a native Cantonese speaker, but not necessarily good in English. Review the English translations, keeping in mind it should be simple, fluent, written like a native speaker, and to the point. Rate the sentences on a scale of 1 to 5:

1: Sentence structure is confusing. Difficult to understand. Or have obvious grammatical mistakes.
2: Contains minor grammatical errors.
3: No ambiguity or mistakes, but might contain awkward phrases or expressions that sound unnatural to the native speaker.
4: Written fluently, without obvious flaws.
5: Excellent writing and style.


For example:

i. 啲貨咁好賣，唔使慌賺唔到錢喎。 The goods are selling so well, there's no need to fear that you cannot earn money.
ii. 美國每四年會舉行一次總統選舉。 The United States holds a presidential election every four years.

Expected output:

i. Rating: 3 ("there is no need to fear" can be better written as "you do not have to worry")
ii. Rating: 4 (no obvious flaws or problems)

Here are the sentences for you to review. In your answer, give the rating, optionally with comments (on the same line) in the format shown above.

A. 你咁趕做咩啫，你慌人哋唔等你咩？ Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?
B. 佢份人夠大量，唔同班𡃁仔計較。 He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids.
C. 學語文冇捷徑，要靠大量浸淫。 There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it.
D. 小新喺同事面前讚美女朋友有幾温柔。 Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender.
E. 我日日都搭地鐵返學。 I take the metro to school every day.

Alright, I need to review these Cantonese to English translations provided by a native Cantonese speaker who may not be proficient in English. The goal is to assess each sentence's fluency, correctness, and naturalness, rating them from 1 to 5 based on the criteria given.

Starting with sentence A: "你咁趕做咩啫，你慌人哋唔等你咩？ Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?" The translation seems a bit off. "Why are you hurry?" is grammatically incorrect in English. A better translation would be "Why are you in such a hurry?" or "Why are you rushing?" Additionally, the second part, "Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?" is understandable but could be phrased more naturally as "Why are you worried that they won't wait for you?" This sentence has grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, so it might rate a 2.

Moving to sentence B: "佢份人夠大量，唔同班𡃁仔計較。 He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids." The translation is mostly accurate, but "唔同班𡃁仔計較" translates to "doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids," which is a bit awkward. A more natural phrasing could be "doesn't argue over minor matters with the children." This sentence has minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, so it might rate a 3.

Sentence C: "學語文冇捷徑，要靠大量浸淫。 There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it." The translation is clear and accurate. It conveys the intended meaning without any grammatical errors or awkwardness. This sentence is well-written and flows naturally, so it should rate a 4.

Sentence D: "小新喺同事面前讚美女朋友有幾温柔。 Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender." The translation is straightforward and accurate. It maintains the original meaning without any grammatical mistakes or awkward phrasing. This sentence is fluent and natural, so it should rate a 4.

Sentence E: "我日日都搭地鐵返學。 I take the metro to school every day." The translation is simple, fluent, and accurate. It directly conveys the original meaning without any errors or awkwardness. This sentence is well-written and natural, so it should rate a 5.

In summary, sentences A and B have some grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, while sentences C, D, and E are well-written and natural. Therefore, the ratings would be as follows:

</Thought>
<Output>
A. Rating: 2 ("Why are you hurry?" can be better written as "Why are you in such a hurry?")
B. Rating: 3 ("唔同班𡃁仔計較" can be better translated as "doesn't argue over minor matters with the children")
C. Rating: 4 (no obvious flaws)
D. Rating: 4 (no obvious flaws)
E. Rating: 5 (excellent writing and style)
</Output> [end of text]
