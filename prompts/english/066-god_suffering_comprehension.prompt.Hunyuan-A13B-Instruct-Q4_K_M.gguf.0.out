### 1. Explain the main thesis of the text in at most 3 sentences.  
The text argues that suffering and evil are not inherent properties of the world but are instead subjective experiences chosen by individuals. It suggests that we create our own perspectives and interpretations of reality, including the belief in suffering, through our desires, beliefs, and choices. Ultimately, the text emphasizes personal agency and the power to change one's experience of the world.

### 2. Do you agree? Explain but be concise.  
I partially agree. While subjective experiences shape how we perceive the world, suffering and evil also have objective components, such as real-world suffering caused by systemic issues or natural disasters. The text's focus on personal choice oversimplifies the complexity of human suffering, which often arises from factors beyond individual control.

### 3. Write a short poem (ideally that rhymes) based on the information above.  
We are vessels of creation,  
Experiencing worlds in our own perception.  
Suffering and evil, they seem to grow,  
But are they real, or just stories we know?  
Choices we make, beliefs we hold,  
Shape the reality we’ve been told.  
Change your view, shift your stance,  
And find a path that serves your chance.
