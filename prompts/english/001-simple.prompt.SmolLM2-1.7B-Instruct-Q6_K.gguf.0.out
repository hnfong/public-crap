1. To count to the number of letters in the English language, you would have to count up to 26. However, you would not necessarily use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number. For example, the number 1 would be written as "1", the number 2 would be written as "2", and so on. The letter "A" would not be used until you reach the number 26, which is the number of letters in the English alphabet.

2. The sentence famous for being the most commonly used sentence in English is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." This sentence was created to test the typing skills of people, as it contains every letter of the alphabet exactly once. It is also known for being the longest sentence in the English language that can be spelled with only the top and bottom row of keys on a standard QWERTY keyboard.

3. Here is a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood:

Once upon a time, in a small village surrounded by rolling hills and dense forests, there lived three little pigs named Jack, Emma, and Olivia. One day, while out on an errand, they stumbled upon a small, mysterious cottage that seemed out of place among the trees. The cottage was small and cozy, with a door that creaked open by itself.

As they cautiously entered the cottage, they were greeted by a friendly old woman who introduced herself as the little red riding hood. She explained that she was a witch who lived in the forest and was known for her magical powers.

The three little pigs were immediately drawn to the witch's magic and decided to stay with her for a while. They spent their days learning spells and practicing their magic, and their nights sleeping in the cozy cottage.

One day, while out on an errand, the three little pigs met the little red riding hood again. This time, however, she was not alone. She had a small, furry companion with her, who was none other than the witch's own daughter.

The three little pigs were amazed by the little red riding hood's daughter, who was as cute as a button. They spent the rest of the day playing with her and learning more about her mother's magic.

As the sun began to set, the three little pigs realized it was time to leave the cottage and return home. They thanked the little red riding hood and her daughter for their hospitality and promised to visit again soon.

And so, the three little pigs returned home, wiser and more magical than ever before. They knew that they had found a true friend in the little red riding hood and her daughter, and they looked forward to many more adventures together. [end of text]
