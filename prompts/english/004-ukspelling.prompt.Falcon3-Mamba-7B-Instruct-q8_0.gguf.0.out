Once upon a time, in a small village in the UK, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved rainbows more than anything else in the world. Every time it rained, she would run outside with her rain boots on, hoping to catch a glimpse of a rainbow.

One day, after a big storm, Lily saw the most beautiful rainbow she had ever seen. It arched across the sky, stretching from one cloud to another. The colors were so bright and vivid: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. It was like a giant, colorful bridge in the sky.

Lily ran and ran, trying to keep up with the rainbow. She laughed and danced, feeling so happy. As she watched, the rainbow slowly moved, following the sun. It was like magic, and Lily wished she could keep it with her forever.

But then, Lily had an idea. She ran home and grabbed her crayons and paper. She drew the rainbow exactly as she saw it, with all the colors in the right order. When she was done, she showed it to her mum.

"Mum, look! I drew the rainbow I saw today," Lily said, beaming with pride.

Her mum hugged her tightly. "That's wonderful, Lily. You've captured its magic perfectly."

From that day on, Lily knew that rainbows were not just beautiful to look at, but also special to remember. She kept her drawing safe, and whenever she felt sad, she would look at it and smile, remembering the rainbow that made her heart sing. And so, Lily's love for rainbows grew even more, filling her heart with joy every time she saw one. [end of text]
