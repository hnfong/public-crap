The fluorescent lights of Northwood High hummed with a frequency that made Kaelen's ears twitch involuntarily. To the other students, it was just the background noise of a Tuesday morning. To Kaelen, it sounded like a swarm of angry, electric bees trapped in a metal box.

He adjusted the collar of his oversized hoodie, pulling it up just enough to hide the pointed tips of his ears that peeked out from his messy, chestnut-brown hair. It was a constant battle of geometry and fabric. If he wore a beanie, he looked like a skater; if he wore a cap, he looked like he was hiding a bad haircut. The hoodie was the only compromise.

"Hey, Kael! You coming to the game Friday?" asked Marcus, slapping him on the back with a force that would have knocked a human off balance.

Kaelen flinched, his reflexes kicking in. He didn't just step back; he *flowed* backward, his feet barely making a sound on the linoleum, landing in a crouch before he straightened up.

"Whoa, easy there, ninja," Marcus laughed, not noticing the unnatural grace of the movement. "You good? You look pale."

"Just didn't sleep well," Kaelen lied smoothly. His voice was soft, melodic, a trait he had to consciously dampen to sound like a normal seventeen-year-old. "Too much homework."

The truth was, he hadn't slept because the school's heating system was set to a dry, scorching heat that made his skin itch. Wood elves thrived in the damp, cool air of the forest, breathing in the scent of pine and loam. Northwood High smelled of floor wax, stale pizza, and teenage anxiety.

Kaelen's greatest challenge wasn't the lights or the heat; it was the biology class.

"Today, we're discussing photosynthesis," Mr. Henderson droned, pointing to a diagram of a leaf on the whiteboard. "Plants convert light energy into chemical energy..."

Kaelen felt a strange pull in his chest. The diagram wasn't just ink; to his eyes, the chlorophyll seemed to glow with a faint, golden pulse. He could almost *taste* the sunlight filtering through the high windows. His fingers itched to reach out and touch the potted fern in the corner, to feel the slow, rhythmic heartbeat of the plant.

*Focus,* he told himself. *You are a human. You are a student. You are not a child of the Elder Grove.*

He had been raised by humans after being found as an infant in the woods behind the school, a secret kept by his adoptive parents who knew the truth but promised to keep it hidden. They had taught him how to blend in, how to suppress the magic that hummed in his blood. But magic, like a river, always found a way to break its banks.

The bell rang, signaling the end of the day. The hallway erupted into a chaotic river of backpacks and chatter. Kaelen moved against the current, heading for the exit. He needed the park. He needed the trees.

As he pushed through the double doors, the air hit him like a cool embrace. The park was a small pocket of green in the concrete city, but it was enough. He walked past the basketball courts, past the swings, until he reached the old oak tree at the edge of the playground.

He sat at its base, closing his eyes. The tension in his shoulders melted away. He could hear the sap rising in the trunk, a slow, deep song. He could feel the roots stretching deep into the earth, drinking the rain from last night.

"Hey, Kael."

He opened his eyes instantly, his pupils dilating into vertical slits before snapping back to round. Standing there was Maya, the girl who sat next to him in History. She was holding two sodas.

"You've been staring at that tree for twenty minutes," she said, handing him a drink. "It's weird. But... kind of cool."

Kaelen took the soda, his fingers brushing hers. "It's a nice tree."

"It's an oak," Maya said, sitting down beside him. "My grandpa says this one is over a hundred years old. He says it remembers everything."

Kaelen smiled, a genuine, unguarded smile that made his eyes crinkle. "Maybe it does."

"You know," Maya said, looking up at the canopy, "sometimes I feel like I don't fit in here either. Like everyone else is speaking a language I don't quite understand. But when I'm out here, it's different."

Kaelen looked at her. She was human, fragile and fleeting, yet she understood the silence better than most. "The world is loud," he said softly. "Sometimes you just need to listen to the quiet things."

Maya laughed. "You sound like a poet, Kael. Or a wizard."

"Maybe a little of both," he whispered, the words slipping out before he could catch them.

Maya paused, looking at him. For a second, Kaelen thought she saw the truth—the pointed ears hidden under his hood, the way the leaves seemed to rustle in his direction even when there was no wind. But then she just shrugged and took a sip of her soda.

"Well, whatever you are, you're the only person who doesn't complain about the cafeteria pizza. So, I'm sticking with you."

Kaelen felt a warmth spread through his chest, warmer than the sun, deeper than the roots. He wasn't just hiding anymore. He was part of this world, too. He was a bridge between the ancient, whispering woods and the noisy, chaotic halls of Northwood High.

"Thanks, Maya," he said.

As the sun began to set, casting long, golden shadows across the grass, Kaelen stood up. He adjusted his hoodie, hiding his ears once more. Tomorrow, the fluorescent lights would hum, the heat would be dry, and the biology class would be difficult. But for now, he had a friend, a soda, and the quiet understanding of an old oak tree.

He walked back toward the school, not with the heavy step of a student dreading the next day, but with the light, silent tread of an elf who knew that even in the concrete jungle, the forest was never truly far away. [end of text]
