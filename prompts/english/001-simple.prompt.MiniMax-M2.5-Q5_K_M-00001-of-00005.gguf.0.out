**3. Write a short story of the three little pigs who met Little Red Riding Hood.**

Once upon a time, in a sunny meadow, the three little pigs were building their houses. The first pig built a house of straw, the second built a house of sticks, and the third built a house of bricks.

One day, while the pigs were outside playing, along came Little Red Riding Hood, carrying a basket of goodies to her grandmother's house. She was lost and asked the pigs for directions.

"Which way to grandmother's cottage?" asked Red.

"The path through the forest," said the first pig nervously. "But be careful—the Big Bad Wolf lives there!"

Just then, the wolf appeared, huffing and puffing! He had chased Red all the way from her grandmother's house. The three little pigs quickly hid inside their houses. The wolf went after the straw house first—he huffed, and the house fell apart! The first pig ran to the stick house, and the wolf followed, blowing the stick house down too!

The pigs rushed to the brick house. The wolf huffed and puffed with all his might, but the brick house stood strong. The wolf tried to climb down the chimney, but the third pig lit a fire, and the wolf ran away, never to be seen again!

Red thanked the pigs for saving her. "You're welcome," said the third pig. "Always build with bricks!"

From that day on, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became good friends, and they all lived happily ever after.
