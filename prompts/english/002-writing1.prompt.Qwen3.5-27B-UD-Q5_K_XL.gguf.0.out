In the small, dusty town of Oakhaven, lived an old man named Elias who believed the world was far too harsh to be loved. He spent his days grumbling about the cold wind and the heavy rain, convinced that everyone else was **exaggerating** the beauty of life just to make him feel inadequate.

One particularly stormy evening, Elias sat by his window, watching the sky turn a bruised purple. His young neighbor, a girl named Maya, knocked on his door. She held a small, lumpy bundle wrapped in a blue blanket.

"Mr. Elias," she said softly, "I made this for you. It's a **pillow** filled with dried lavender and feathers from the barn. I thought it might help you sleep better when the thunder rolls."

Elias sighed, taking the bundle. "It's just a pillow, Maya. It won't stop the storm. You're **exaggerating** what a little stuffing can do against the world."

Maya smiled, her eyes bright despite the gloom outside. "Maybe not the storm, but it can hold you while you wait for it to pass. That's what love does. It doesn't fix everything, but it makes the waiting bearable."

That night, Elias placed the lavender-scented pillow under his head. As the thunder rumbled, he closed his eyes and imagined the softness beneath him. Slowly, the harsh edges of his thoughts began to blur. He realized that the pillow felt less like a mere object and more like a **cloud** that had drifted down from the sky just to catch him.

For the first time in years, Elias understood that love wasn't about grand gestures or fixing every problem. It was the quiet presence of someone who cared enough to offer a soft place to rest. It was the realization that even in the darkest storms, we are never truly alone if we allow ourselves to be held by the love of others. [end of text]
