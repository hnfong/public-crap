Here are the answers to your questions:

### 1. The First "A" in Counting
You would have to count all the way to **one thousand** before you use the letter "A" in the English spelling of a whole number.

Here is the breakdown:
*   Numbers 1–99 do not contain an "a" (e.g., one, ten, ninety-nine).
*   Numbers 100–999 use the word "hundred" (e.g., one hundred, two hundred), but still no "a".
*   Even when using "and" (as in British English, e.g., "one hundred **and** one"), the letter "a" appears. However, in standard American mathematical naming conventions, the word "and" is often omitted for whole numbers (e.g., "one hundred one").
*   If we strictly follow the naming of the numbers themselves without conjunctions like "and," the first number to include the letter "a" is **one thousand**.

*(Note: If you include the word "and" as part of the standard spoken form, then "one hundred and one" would be the first instance. However, in riddles and linguistic puzzles of this type, the answer is almost universally accepted as **one thousand** because "and" is considered a connector, not part of the number's name.)*

### 2. The Quick Brown Fox
**Completed Sentence:**
"The quick brown fox **jumps over the lazy dog**."

**Why it is famous:**
This sentence is famous because it is a **pangram**. A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the English alphabet at least once. Because it is relatively coherent and short, it has been used for decades to:
*   Test typewriters and computer keyboards (to ensure every key works).
*   Display font samples (so you can see what every letter looks like in a specific typeface).
*   Practice handwriting and calligraphy.

### 3. Story: The Three Little Pigs Meet Little Red Riding Hood

Once upon a time, the three little pigs had just finished building their houses. The first pig lived in straw, the second in sticks, and the third, wise little pig, in sturdy bricks. They were enjoying a quiet afternoon tea when they heard a rustling in the woods nearby.

Out stepped Little Red Riding Hood, clutching her basket tightly, looking quite flustered.

"Oh my!" cried the first little pig. "Are you running from the Big Bad Wolf?"

"Yes!" Red replied, out of breath. "He tricked me and ate my grandmother! I barely escaped through the window. I heard he was heading this way looking for more snacks."

The third little pig, who was the wisest, immediately ushered her inside his brick house. "Quickly, come in! My brothers' houses won't hold him, but my walls are strong."

Just as they locked the heavy oak door, the Big Bad Wolf arrived. He huffed and puffed at the straw house, blowing it away in seconds. The first pig squealed and ran to the stick house. The wolf huffed and puffed again, toppling the sticks. Both pigs scrambled toward the brick house just as the wolf lunged.

The wolf stood before the brick house, took a deep breath, and huffed and puffed with all his might. But the house didn't budge. He tried again and again until he was dizzy, but the brick walls held firm.

Inside, Little Red Riding Hood had an idea. "My grandmother always said wolves have a sweet tooth," she whispered. "Let's trick him."

The third pig built a large fire in the fireplace and hung a massive pot of water over it. Meanwhile, Red called out through the chimney, "Mr. Wolf! If you can't blow the house down, perhaps you'd like some delicious honey dumplings? Come down the chimney to get them!"

Greedy as he was, the wolf couldn't resist. He climbed onto the roof and slid down the chimney. *SPLASH!* He landed right in the boiling pot. With a yelp, he shot back up the chimney and ran off into the forest, never to bother anyone again.

That evening, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood shared the dumplings (which were safe in a different pot) and celebrated their victory. They learned that while bricks provide strong walls, working together and using their wits was the strongest defense of all. [end of text]
