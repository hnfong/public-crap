Here are a couple sentences in both Cantonese and English. They are written by somebody who is a native Cantonese speaker, but not necessarily good in English. Review the English translations, keeping in mind it should be simple, fluent, written like a native speaker, and to the point. Rate the sentences on a scale of 1 to 5:

1: Sentence structure is confusing. Difficult to understand. Or have obvious grammatical mistakes.
2: Contains minor grammatical errors.
3: No ambiguity or mistakes, but might contain awkward phrases or expressions that sound unnatural to the native speaker.
4: Written fluently, without obvious flaws.
5: Excellent writing and style.


For example:

i. 啲貨咁好賣，唔使慌賺唔到錢喎。 The goods are selling so well, there's no need to fear that you cannot earn money.
ii. 美國每四年會舉行一次總統選舉。 The United States holds a presidential election every four years.

Expected output:

i. Rating: 3 ("there is no need to fear" can be better written as "you do not have to worry")
ii. Rating: 4 (no obvious flaws or problems)

Here are the sentences for you to review. In your answer, give the rating, optionally with comments (on the same line) in the format shown above.

Here are the reviews with ratings and optional comments:

**A.** Rating: 3 ("Why are you in a hurry?" is more natural; "worry that they won't wait for you" could be rephrased as "afraid others will leave without you")
你咁趕做咩啫，你慌人哋唔等你咩？ 
Why are you in a hurry? Why are you afraid others will leave without you?

**B.** Rating: 4 (minor suggestion for more common adjective usage)
佢份人夠大量，唔同班𡃁仔計較。
He is a **very generous** person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids. (_"Magnanimous" is correct but less commonly used in everyday speech; "very generous" conveys a similar meaning more approachably_)

**C.** Rating: 5
學語文冇捷徑，要靠大量浸淫。
There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it. (_Direct, clear, and naturally phrased_)

**D.** Rating: 3 ("in front of his colleagues" could be more naturally phrased; "tender" might not fully capture the intended nuance of "温柔")
小新喺同事面前讚美女朋友有幾温柔。
Siu-san praises his girlfriend **to his colleagues** for being **very kind/gentle**. (_"温柔" can imply kindness, gentleness, or even sweetness, so the translation could be adjusted based on context_)

**E.** Rating: 5
我日日都搭地鐵返學。
I take the metro to school every day. (_Simple, direct, and fluently phrased_) [end of text]
