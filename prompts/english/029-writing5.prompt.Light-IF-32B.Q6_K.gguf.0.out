Sure! Here's a short story about a teenage student in Hong Kong who is secretly a wood elf. I'll try to write it in a natural, student-like voice, with some small grammar or style mistakes to make it feel real.

**My Secret Life at St. Mary’s**  

My name is Lian. I’m 15 years old, and I go to St. Mary’s Secondary School in Kowloon. To everyone, I’m just a normal girl with messy hair and a love for drawing. But the truth is… I’m a wood elf.  

I was born in the forest near Tai Mo Shan, but when I was little, a bad man tried to hurt my family. My grandma took me to Hong Kong, and we hid in a small flat in Sham Shui Po. She said I had to be careful—no one could know.  

At school, I try to be like everyone else. I sit in the back of the class, wear the uniform, and smile when the teacher asks me questions. But sometimes, things slip.  

Last week, during PE, we had to run around the field. I was tired, but when I felt the wind in my face, my legs moved faster than anyone else’s. I finished first, and all the girls stared at me. The PE teacher laughed and said, “Lian, you’re like a deer!” I smiled, but my face felt hot.  

Worst of all was the time I forgot to put on my “human” shoes. I was walking to the canteen, and my feet were bare. The soles were soft, like leaves, and I could feel the ground—every stone, every crack. But when a boy from my class, Mark, saw me, he stopped. “Hey, Lian,” he said. “Your feet… they’re weird.”  

I froze. My heart beat fast. I quickly put on my shoes from my bag and said, “It’s nothing. I dropped my shoes.” He laughed and walked away, but I felt scared.  

That night, I cried in my room. Grandma found me and hugged me. “You’re safe,” she said. “But you have to be brave. Your heart is good, and that’s what matters.”  

Today, I decided to be more brave. I joined the art club. I drew a picture of a forest with trees that looked like my home. When the teacher saw it, she smiled and said, “This is amazing, Lian. You have a real talent.”  

After school, I went to the park near our flat. I sat on a bench and watched the sunset. The wind smelled like flowers, and I felt happy. For a moment, I forgot to be scared.  

I’m still a wood elf. I still have to hide. But I’m trying to be myself, little by little.  

Maybe one day, I can tell everyone.  

But for now, I’m just Lian. A girl with messy hair, a love for drawing, and a secret heart that beats for the forest.
