**1. Main Thesis (in 3 sentences):**  
The text argues that God creates all of existence, including subjective experiences, and that our feelings of suffering or evil are not inherent but are chosen by our awareness and perspective within God’s boundless creation. Our sense of suffering is a subjective filter we apply to the universe, not an objective reality imposed upon us. Ultimately, all perceived evils and sufferings are the result of how we choose to experience God’s infinite creation.

**2. Agreement (concise):**  
I partially agree—the text offers a philosophical perspective that suffering is subjective and shaped by our choices, not an objective, external fact. However, I believe there can be objective suffering (like physical pain), even if our interpretation and response to it are subjective.

**3. Rhyming Poem Based on the Text:**

In realms of endless making,  
Where all is born and shaped,  
Each soul selects its seeing—  
And in that light is bled.  
Suffering’s a mirror’s trick,  
Not a stone or fact;  
We paint the shadows darker,  
But the canvas holds them all.  
So if there’s pain or evil’s cry,  
It’s how we look, not why. [end of text]
