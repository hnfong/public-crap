 1. The main thesis of the text is that God, as the creator of everything, supports and nurtures all creations, and we as vessels for experiencing God's creation have subjective experiences that are shaped by our choices and perspective. The text argues that suffering and evil are subjective experiences that we choose to believe in or perceive.
2. I do not fully agree with the text's argument. While it is true that our subjective experiences shape how we perceive the world, it is reductionist to say that suffering and evil are merely personal choices to believe in. There are objective realities of suffering and evil that exist in the world, and to dismiss them as subjective choices is to ignore the real pain and harm that people experience.
3. Infinite expanse, God's creation,
Vessels of experience, our station.
Subjective views, desires abound,
Yet, in objective truth, we're bound.

Suffering and evil, real and raw,
Not just a choice, a heavy draw.
Though we shape our world, we must see,
The pain of others, sets us free. [end of text]
