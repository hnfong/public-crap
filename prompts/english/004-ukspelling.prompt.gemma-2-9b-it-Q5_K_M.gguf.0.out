I love the rainbows that appear after a big storm. 

The rain stops, the clouds part, and there it is - a giant, colourful arch across the sky. It's like a magic bridge between the earth and the clouds. 

Sometimes, the colours are so bright, they seem to glow. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet - all swirled together in a beautiful mess. 

I like to stand outside and watch the rainbow, imagining all the adventures it could take me on. Maybe it leads to a land made of sweets, or a castle in the clouds. 

Whatever it leads to, I know one thing for sure: rainbows always make me smile.
