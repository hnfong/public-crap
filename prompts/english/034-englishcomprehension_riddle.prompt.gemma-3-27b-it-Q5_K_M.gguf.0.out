Consider this scenario:

Alice: Are you eating healthy?
Bob: Yes! Today I ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat.
Alice: Wow! Let me see.
Bob: (sends Alice a photo)
Alice: wtf

---
Question: what happened? What did Bob eat and was it healthy?

Here's what happened and a breakdown of Bob's "meal":

**What happened:** Bob is being deliberately obtuse and trying to sound healthy while describing something utterly bizarre and unappetizing. He's playing with the *words* associated with healthy eating ("aged," "organic," "whole wheat") but combining them in a ridiculous way. Alice's "wtf" reaction confirms this.

**What Bob ate:** He ate **milk (aged, organic) poured over tomato purée on toast (baked whole wheat)**. 

**Was it healthy?** Technically, the *individual components* could be considered healthy in moderation. However, the combination is not a normal or sensible meal. It's likely very high in lactose (from the milk) and the texture and flavor combination would be awful. It's definitely *not* a healthy or typical way to eat those ingredients. He's using the language of health to disguise a strange food choice.
