### Answers:

1. **How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?**  
   You would have to count to **one thousand (1,000)** before using the letter "A" in the spelling of a whole number. The number "one thousand" is the first number in English that contains the letter "A."

2. **Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox ..."; What is the sentence famous for?**  
   The full sentence is: **"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."**  
   This sentence is famous for being a **pangram**â€”a sentence that contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once. It is often used for typing practice, font displays, and testing keyboards.

3. **Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.**  
   *Once upon a time, the Three Little Pigs were busy building their houses when they heard a sweet voice calling for help. It was Little Red Riding Hood, who was lost in the forest. The pigs invited her inside their brick house (the one that could withstand the Big Bad Wolf). Together, they devised a plan to outsmart the wolf. When he came huffing and puffing, the pigs, Red Riding Hood, and her grandmother (who was visiting) all worked together to trap the wolf in a net. From that day on, they became the best of friends and lived happily, always looking out for one another in the forest.*
