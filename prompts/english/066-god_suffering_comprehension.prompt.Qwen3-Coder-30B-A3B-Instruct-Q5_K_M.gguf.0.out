1. The main thesis is that God creates everything including suffering, but our subjective experiences and perceptions of suffering are ultimately chosen by us. We are vessels for experiencing God's creation, and what we perceive as evil or suffering is actually a result of our own choices about what to experience. The text argues that suffering exists because we choose to perceive it, not because God is absent or evil.

2. I find the argument compelling in its logical consistency, though it raises difficult questions about free will and moral responsibility. The idea that we choose our experiences aligns with some philosophical traditions but may seem counterintuitive to those who experience genuine hardship. The text's emphasis on agency and choice offers a unique perspective on suffering, though it might be seen as overly deterministic.

3. Here's a rhyming poem based on the text:

In God's vast creation, all things unfold,
Suffering and joy, both stories untold.
We are the vessels, the experience's seat,
Choosing what we see, what we can't retreat.
The tiger's roar is just a doll's pretend,
Our minds create what we believe to mend.
In every choice, in every moment's call,
We shape our world, we're not just victims' thrall. [end of text]
