**3. Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.**

Once upon a time, in a sunny meadow, the three little pigs were busy building their new homes. The first little pig, being lazy, built his house out of straw. The second little pig, being a bit more ambitious, built his house out of sticks. And the third little pig, being the most ambitious of all, built his house out of bricks.

Just as they were finishing up, a curious little girl with a red hooded cloak came walking by. "Hello there, little pigs!" she exclaimed. "My name is Little Red Riding Hood. What are you doing here?"

The three little pigs introduced themselves and explained their new homes. Little Red Riding Hood was impressed by their hard work and asked if she could take a look inside. The first little pig proudly showed her his straw house, but Little Red Riding Hood warned him, "Be careful, a big bad wolf might come and blow your house down!"

The second little pig showed her his stick house, and Little Red Riding Hood cautioned, "That's a bit better, but still not strong enough. What if the wolf huffs and puffs?"

The third little pig beamed with pride as he showed her his brick house. Little Red Riding Hood exclaimed, "Ah, now this is a safe and cozy home! You're ready for any big bad wolf that comes your way."

Just then, a loud growling sound came from the nearby woods. "Oh no, it's the big bad wolf!" cried the three little pigs. But Little Red Riding Hood stood tall and said, "Don't worry, I've dealt with wolves before. Let's work together to chase him away!"

With Little Red Riding Hood's quick thinking and the three little pigs' bravery, they successfully scared the big bad wolf away. From that day on, the four new friends would often meet in the meadow, sharing stories and having grand adventures together. [end of text]
