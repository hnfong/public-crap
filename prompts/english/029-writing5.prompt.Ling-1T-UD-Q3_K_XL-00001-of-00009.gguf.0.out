The first bell rang, slicing through the mist that clung to the playground like damp gauze. Lin adjusted the hood of his grey sweater, pulling it lower. Most mornings, the fog was just weather. Today, it felt like a veil.

He slipped into his seat at the back of Mr. Davies’ English class just as the roll call began.

“Lin Ho-cheung?”

“Here,” he murmured, fingers tracing the grain of the wooden desk. *Oak,* he thought. *Rough-cut, maybe thirty years old. Knot here, split there from a careless nail…* The details bloomed in his mind like unfurling fern fronds.

He hated it sometimes. The knowing. The way the world whispered its secrets only to him—the sigh of stressed pine in the gym bleachers, the tight, anxious ring of laminated plywood in the art room, the slow, patient memory held in the century-old banyan roots snaking beneath the school’s foundation.

He was Lin Ho-cheung: 16, average grades, quiet. He wore headphones on the MTR, doodled elven script in the margins of his physics notes (disguised as circuit diagrams), and helped Mrs. Chan in the library reshelve books just so he could press his palm against the oak panelling and breathe.

But beneath the human skin—thin, vulnerable, prone to acne and awkwardness—lay something else. Lin was *Sylvain*, wood-kin. His blood ran sap-thick and slow; moonlight, not food, sustained him. His senses drank the city’s green whispers where others heard only traffic.

The stylistic issue was always the hardest. Like now. Mr. Davies droned on about *Macbeth*’s “vaulting ambition.” Lin’s pen hovered. *Ambition,* he thought. *A human word. Like trying to describe starlight with a burnt match.* His own people sought harmony, growth, the quiet song between root and rain. Human lives felt so… loud. A frantic buzz of deadlines, social static, the sharp clang of metal lockers that made his teeth ache.

He wrote: *Macbeth’s ambition is like a wildfire. It consumes fast, bright, and leaves only ash. Elves understand fire. We respect its power. We prefer the slow burn of coals that warm a hearth for generations.*

He scratched it out. Too poetic. Too revealing. Too *elf*. He rewrote: *Macbeth’s ambition is destructive and ultimately self-defeating, leading to his downfall.* Safe. Bland. Human.

Lunchtime. The covered playground hummed with chatter. Lin found his usual spot beneath the jacaranda tree, its gnarled roots a familiar comfort. He unwrapped his *dai pai dong* pork chop rice. As he lifted the container, a tremor ran through his hands. Not hunger. Alarm.

The chopsticks—cheap, mass-produced bamboo—screamed.

*Not bamboo,* the wood wailed in his mind. *Phyllostachys aurea, yes, but harvested green, soaked in preservative salts, machine-pressed… it’s screaming under the lacquer.*

Lin dropped the chopsticks. They clattered loudly. Heads turned. He mumbled an apology, picked them up, forced his fingers to close around the tormented wood. He ate silently, each bite an act of penance.

After school, he detoured to the old quarry-turned-park on Beacon Hill. Twilight bled purple and gold over the city. Here, the trees were older, wiser. He pressed his forehead against the bark of a camphor tree, eyes closed. The city’s roar faded, replaced by the deep, resonant hum of the living wood, the sigh of wind through high branches, the slow pulse of sap rising with the cooling air.

He was whole here. Lin *and* Sylvain. Not hiding.

A sharp cry pierced the quiet—a myna bird, tangled in discarded kite string high in a eucalyptus. Lin’s breath caught. Human reflexes were too slow, too clumsy. But wood-kin? He flowed.

He moved like shadow through the undergrowth, silent as falling pollen. He didn’t climb; he *communed*. His fingers found purchase not on bark, but on the tree’s tension, its balance. He reached the bird, its frantic heartbeat a tiny drum against his palm. The string had cut deep.

Gently, he unwound it, whispering not words, but a low, resonant hum—a song older than Cantonese, older than the hills. It was a lullaby for fractured wood, for frightened things. The bird’s trembling eased. Its dark, bright eye held his gaze for a heartbeat, then it launched itself into the dusk, a feathered arrow.

Lin slid down, landing softly on the forest floor. Exhaustion washed over him, human and deep. He’d used his gift openly. Risked it.

Walking home, the city lights glittered like trapped fireflies. He passed a construction site. A stack of fresh concrete formwork plywood leaned against a fence. It wept—a high, thin keen of violated fibres. Lin paused, hand hovering. He couldn’t heal industrial grief. Not yet.

But in his pocket, his fingers found a smooth oval stone he’d pocketed weeks ago from the park stream. He closed his eyes and hummed the camphor tree’s song, low and steady, a counterpoint to the wood’s distress. A small comfort. An acknowledgement.

He wasn’t just hiding. He was listening. Tending. Surviving.

He stepped onto the escalator at the MTR station, the crowd a river of tired humanity. He pulled his hood up again. Just Lin Ho-cheung, heading home. But as the metal stairs carried him downward, he felt the quiet echo of the forest within him, a deep root holding fast in the noisy, concrete soil. The grammar of his double life was complex, full of dropped articles and awkward idioms. But the meaning? That was clear. He belonged to both worlds, and the quiet, careful tending of small, broken things was his truest language. [end of text]
