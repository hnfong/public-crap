Okay, here are the answers to your questions, based on the provided text:

**1. Explain the main thesis of the text in at most 3 sentences.**

The text argues that suffering and evil in the world are not inherent realities but rather the result of individual subjective choices in experiencing God's creation. It posits that we, as vessels for experiencing this creation, shape our own realities by choosing what and how we perceive, effectively creating our own worlds. Therefore, the existence of suffering is a personal choice to believe in or perceive it, rather than an objective truth.

**2. Do you agree? Explain but be concise.**

I find the text's perspective thought-provoking, but ultimately difficult to fully agree with. While acknowledging the power of subjective experience, it seems to downplay the very real, objective impact of suffering on individuals and societies. Attributing all suffering solely to personal choice feels dismissive of systemic issues and external forces beyond individual control.

**3. Write a short poem (ideally that rhymes) based on the information above.**

A cosmic law, a boundless grace,
God's creation fills all time and space.
We choose our view, our world to see,
And shape our fate, for you and me.

Suffering's shadow, a chosen plight,
A belief embraced, both dark and bright.
Though pain may linger, a path remains,
To shift our focus, break the chains.



I hope this is satisfactory! [end of text]
