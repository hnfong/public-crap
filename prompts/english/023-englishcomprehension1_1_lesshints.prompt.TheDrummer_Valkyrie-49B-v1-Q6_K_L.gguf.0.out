After carefully reading the passage and considering the hint about the distinctive writing style being connected to a particular day and month, I've made an educated guess about the date of the article's composition.

My best guess is that this passage was written on April 1st, 2023.

The reasoning behind this is as follows:

1. The writing style is overly dramatic and opinionated, with sweeping statements about the Rust and C++ communities. This hyperbolic tone is reminiscent of April Fool's Day articles, which often use satire and exaggeration for comedic effect.

2. The author's claims about the Rust community being "imperious" and "denigrating all other languages" are likely an exaggeration. While there may be some vocal Rust advocates, the community as a whole is not known for such behavior. This kind of caricature is typical of April Fool's Day pieces.

3. The mention of "the C++ subreddit being well known for their sense of humor" is also a red flag. While the C++ community does have a sense of humor, this statement seems to be setting up a punchline or ironic twist, which is common in April Fool's Day writing.

4. The author's dismissal of the Rust community's code of conduct and diversity initiatives as "politics" that don't belong in programming is a controversial stance. This kind of contrarian opinion is often used in April Fool's Day articles to provoke a reaction.

5. The overall tone of the passage, with its dramatic language and sweeping declarations, is more akin to a satirical piece than a genuine technical article. The author's claims about C++'s superiority and Rust's shortcomings are presented in an overly confident and dismissive manner, which is typical of April Fool's Day writing.

In summary, while the passage appears to be a genuine technical article at first glance, its hyperbolic tone, exaggerated claims, and contrarian opinions suggest that it is likely an April Fool's Day piece. The distinctive writing style, with its dramatic language and satirical elements, is a strong indicator that the article was written on April 1st, 2023. [end of text]
