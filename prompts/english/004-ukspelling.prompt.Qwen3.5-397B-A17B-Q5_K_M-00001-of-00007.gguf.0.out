After the big storm, the grey clouds roll away. The sun peeks out, warm and golden. Suddenly, a giant rainbow stretches across the sky above our garden. It is my favourite kind of rainbow because it looks so close, as if I could touch it.

The colours are bright and clear. There is red like a post box, orange like a juicy tangerine, and yellow like a shiny duck. Then comes green like fresh grass, blue like the sea, indigo like a dark berry, and violet like a pretty flower.

I put on my wellies and run outside. The puddles sparkle in the light. My little dog, Buster, barks at the rainbow, thinking it is a giant arch to jump through. We stand together on the wet path, looking up in wonder.

For a short time, the world feels magical and happy. The rain has washed everything clean, and the rainbow is nature's special gift. It reminds me that after every rainy day, something beautiful will always appear. I smile wide, hoping the colours stay just a little bit longer. [end of text]
