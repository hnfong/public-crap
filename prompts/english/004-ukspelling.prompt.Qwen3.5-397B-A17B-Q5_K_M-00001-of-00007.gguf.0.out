After a heavy shower in the garden, the grey clouds roll away. Suddenly, a giant arc of colour stretches across the blue sky. It is my favourite kind of rainbow.

It looks like a bright bridge made of light. I can see red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. The colours are so vivid they seem to glow against the wet grass. My wellies splash in the puddles as I run to get a better look.

Mum says if you chase a rainbow, you might find a pot of gold at the end. I do not think there is real gold there, but the view is just as special. It feels like a secret gift from the sky, just for us.

Soon, the sun gets stronger and the rainbow fades away. But for a few magical minutes, the world felt full of wonder. I love how the rain and the sun work together to paint such a beautiful picture high above our little town. It makes me smile every single time. [end of text]
