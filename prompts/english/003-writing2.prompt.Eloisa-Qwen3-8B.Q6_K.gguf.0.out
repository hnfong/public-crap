Okay, the user wants a story about loss or grieving in under 10 words. Let me think... First, I need to capture the essence of loss concisely. Maybe use a metaphor or a simple image. Words like "gone," "empty," "shadow" come to mind. Let me try combining them. "Shadow fades where light once lived." That's 8 words. Does it convey loss? The fading shadow suggests absence. Maybe add more emotion. "Empty chair, silent room, tears fall." Wait, that's 7 words. It's more direct. Or "Heart breaks, world fades to gray." Hmm, 6 words. But does it show grieving? Maybe "Silent tears, empty hands, lost forever." 7 words. I think the user wants something poignant but brief. Let me check the example response. Oh, the assistant used "Shadow fades where light once lived." That's good. I should aim for similar brevity and impact. Let me finalize with that.
