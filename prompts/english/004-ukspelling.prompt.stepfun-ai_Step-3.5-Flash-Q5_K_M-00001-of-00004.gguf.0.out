Okay, the user wants me to act as a UK children's writer and create a short story under 200 words about rainbows, using simple UK English. Let me break down the requirements.

First, I need to ensure the language is UK-specific—spellings like "colour" instead of "color," and terms like "mum" instead of "mom." The story should be simple enough for kids but engaging. 

Hmm, the user mentioned "rainbows that you like the most." Maybe focus on a personal, nostalgic angle to make it relatable. A memory with a grandparent could add warmth. 

Keep it under 200 words. Let me outline: start with a scene after rain, describe the rainbow vividly but simply, tie it to a childhood memory, and end with a comforting thought. 

Check word count as I go. Use short sentences and active verbs. Avoid complex metaphors. Maybe include sensory details like the smell of wet grass to make it immersive. 

Wait, did I use UK spellings? "Colour," "mum," "granny"—yes. Keep the tone gentle and whimsical, like a bedtime story. Make sure the rainbow feels magical but grounded in a child's experience.

After a big summer shower, when the sun peeks through the clouds, I look for my favourite rainbow. It’s not the biggest or the brightest. It’s the one that appears when I’m sitting on the back step with my gran, the air smelling of wet grass and warm pavement.

This rainbow is soft. Its colours are gentle, like a watercolour painting left in the rain. The red is more rose than fire-engine, and the violet melts into the sky. It doesn’t stretch across the whole world; it’s a short, sweet arch right over our garden, with one end touching the old apple tree.

Gran says it’s a promise that the rain is finished. I think it’s a secret message, just for us. It means that even after a downpour, something beautiful can appear, quiet and close, right where you are. It’s the rainbow that feels like a hug. [end of text]
