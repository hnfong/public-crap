Okay, let's try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is about figuring out the color of a block that's unknown. Let me read it again carefully.

First, the setup: There are 3 black blocks on top of a block whose color we don't know. Beneath those black blocks, there's a blue block. So the order from top to bottom would be: 3 black blocks, then the unknown color, then a blue block. Wait, no—the problem says "3 black blocks on top of a block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block." Hmm, maybe I need to parse that sentence again.

Wait, "3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block." So the structure is: the unknown block is under the 3 black blocks, and beneath the 3 black blocks (so the unknown block is under the black ones), and then beneath the unknown block is a blue block. Wait, no. Let's break it down.

"3 black blocks on top of [an unknown color block] and beneath them [the 3 black blocks] there is a blue block." Wait, "beneath them" refers to the 3 black blocks. So the 3 black blocks are on top of the unknown block, and beneath the 3 black blocks (so the unknown block is below the black ones), and then beneath the unknown block is a blue block. Wait, that might not make sense. Let's think of it as layers.

Top layer: 3 black blocks. Then, the next layer down is the unknown color block. Then, beneath that (so the layer below the unknown block) is a blue block. Wait, but the problem says "beneath them there is a blue block." "Them" refers to the 3 black blocks. So beneath the 3 black blocks (i.e., the layer directly under the black blocks) is the unknown block, and then beneath that unknown block is the blue block? Or is the blue block directly beneath the 3 black blocks?

Wait, maybe the structure is: the 3 black blocks are on top of the unknown block, and the blue block is beneath the unknown block. So the order from top to bottom is: 3 black, unknown, blue. So the unknown block is between the black blocks and the blue block.

Then, we remove all blocks and shuffle them with one additional green block, then put them back. So total blocks before shuffling: 3 black + 1 unknown + 1 blue = 5 blocks. Then add a green block, making 6 blocks. Then shuffle and stack them again.

After shuffling, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. Wait, but the original blocks didn't have a yellow block. Wait, the problem says "we remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block." So the original blocks are 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue. Then add a green block, so total 6 blocks. But the problem mentions a yellow block in the final arrangement. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the problem says "the yellow block is on top of blue block." But where did the yellow block come from? The original blocks were black, unknown, blue. Then we added a green block. So unless the unknown block is yellow? Wait, maybe the unknown block's color is yellow, but the problem says "we don't know the color of" it. Wait, but the question is asking for the color of the unknown block. So maybe the yellow block is part of the shuffled blocks, but the original blocks didn't have yellow. Wait, this is a bit confusing.

Wait, let's re-read the problem:

"There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block. We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of blue block.

What color is the block we don't know the color of? Only answer in one word. Don't explain."

Wait, so the original setup: 3 black blocks on top of an unknown color block, and beneath the 3 black blocks (so the unknown block is under the black ones), and beneath the unknown block is a blue block. So the stack is: [3 black] on top of [unknown], and [blue] beneath the unknown. So the order from top to bottom: black, black, black, unknown, blue.

Wait, but "beneath them there is a blue block"—"them" refers to the 3 black blocks. So beneath the 3 black blocks (i.e., the block directly under the black blocks) is the unknown block, and then beneath that unknown block is the blue block. So the stack is: top: 3 black, then unknown, then blue. So the unknown is between the black and blue.

Then, we remove all blocks (so 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue), add a green block (so now 6 blocks total), shuffle them, and stack them. After shuffling, the yellow block is on top of the blue block.

Wait, but where did the yellow block come from? The original blocks don't have yellow. Unless the unknown block is yellow. Because the problem says "the block we don't know the color of"—so maybe that unknown block is yellow, and when they shuffled, the yellow block (which was the unknown) is now on top of the blue block.

Wait, but the problem states that after shuffling, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. So the yellow block must be one of the blocks in the shuffled set. Since the only blocks we have are 3 black, 1 unknown (which we're trying to find), 1 blue, and 1 green. So the yellow block must be the unknown one. Because the other blocks are black, blue, green. So the unknown block must be yellow. Therefore, the answer is yellow.

Wait, but let's check again. The problem says "the yellow block is on top of blue block." So in the shuffled stack, there's a yellow block directly above the blue block. The blocks we have are: 3 black, 1 unknown (which could be yellow), 1 blue, 1 green. So the yellow block must be the unknown one. Therefore, the unknown block's color is yellow.

But let's make sure. The problem says "we don't know the color of" the block, and after shuffling, there's a yellow block on top of blue. So the yellow block must be the one that was previously unknown. So the answer is yellow.

Wait, but the problem says "shuffle the blocks with one additional green block". So the blocks being shuffled are the original 5 (3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue) plus 1 green, making 6. So the yellow block must be part of the original blocks, but the original blocks didn't have yellow. Therefore, the unknown block must be yellow. So the color we don't know is yellow.

Yes, that makes sense. Because the only block whose color we don't know is the one that's now yellow. So the answer is yellow.
