I’ll write about silence.

Not the absence of sound — that’s too simple, too literal. I mean the silence that settles after a loved one leaves the room, the kind that hums in your bones. The silence that isn’t empty, but full — full of unsaid apologies, half-formed dreams, the ghost of a laugh that used to fill the kitchen.

I used to think silence was a void. A failure of communication. I’d rush to fill it — with music, with chatter, with the frantic energy of trying to prove I wasn’t alone. But silence doesn’t demand filling. It asks for listening.

I learned this in the quiet after my grandmother died. Not the hush of the funeral home — that was polite, performative. No, it was the silence in her kitchen, three days later, when I poured myself a cup of tea using her chipped blue mug. The kettle whistled. I didn’t move. The steam curled like a question mark in the air.

And then — silence. Not empty. Not dead.

It was full of her humming while she kneaded dough. Of the way she’d say “I’m fine” when she wasn’t. The smell of lavender soap on her hands. The way she’d leave the porch light on for me, even when I wasn’t coming home.

That silence? It didn’t need words. It was the echo of love that outlasted voice.

Sometimes, the deepest things aren’t spoken.

They’re held.

In the quiet.

Between heartbeats.

And that — that’s where the soul learns to listen. [end of text]
