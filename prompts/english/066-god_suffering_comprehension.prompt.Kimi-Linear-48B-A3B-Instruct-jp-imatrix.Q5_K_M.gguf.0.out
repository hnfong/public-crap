1. **Main Thesis (3 sentences):**  
   The text argues that suffering and evil are not inherent realities but subjective experiences we choose through our perception and belief. God, as the creator of all possibilities, is not a personal being but a universal mechanism that supports all existence. Since we are vessels for experiencing this creation, our subjective experiences—including suffering—are ultimately chosen by us, and we can change our perspective or situation if we desire.

2. **Agreement (concise):**  
   I partially agree. While the text offers a compelling philosophical lens, it risks oversimplifying real suffering by framing it as purely subjective. Not all pain is a matter of perception—systemic injustice, trauma, and existential despair are not just "choices." However, the emphasis on agency and perspective is valuable.

3. **Short Rhyming Poem:**  
   *We choose the lens through which we see,*  
   *The pain, the joy, the dark, the free.*  
   *God’s vast field, all possibilities,*  
   *Yet we decide what we’ll believe.*  
   *Suffering’s not carved in stone,*  
   *But shaped by thought, by what we own.*  
   *To heal, we must first own the choice—  
   *Then find the path to change our voice.* [end of text]
