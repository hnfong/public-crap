3. Here is a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood:

Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived three little pigs who loved to build houses. The first pig built his house out of straw, the second pig built his house out of sticks, and the third pig built his house out of bricks.

One day, the little red riding hood came to the village to visit her grandmother. She rode her horse through the forest, and as she walked, she saw the three little pigs building their houses.

The first pig, who built his house out of straw, was afraid of the big bad wolf. So, he asked the little red riding hood to help him build a stronger house. She agreed to help him, and together they built a house out of sticks.

The second pig, who built his house out of sticks, was also afraid of the big bad wolf. So, he asked the little red riding hood to help him build a stronger house. She agreed to help him, and together they built a house out of bricks.

The third pig, who built his house out of bricks, was not afraid of the big bad wolf. He knew that he could build a strong house, and he was right. The big bad wolf tried to blow down the straw house, but it was too weak. He tried to blow down the stick house, but it was too weak. But he couldn't blow down the brick house, because it was too strong.

The little red riding hood and the three little pigs had a great time building their houses. They learned that it's important to build a strong house, and that it's also important to ask for help when you need it. And they all lived happily ever after. [end of text]
