Me, Wong Wing, sit in class, try my best to pay attention. Teacher, Mrs. Lee, talk about math problem, but me mind wander. Me think about... other things. Me have secret. Me no tell anyone, not even best friend, Emily. Me have... special gift. Me have pointy ears, and me can talk to trees. Me, Wong Wing, wood elf.

Me grow up in Hong Kong, but me no know me self. Me just know me different. Me have strange dreams, and me can hear whispers in forest. Me try to ignore, but me can't. Me feel like me belong in forest, not in school.

Me sit in class, trying to blend in. Me wear normal clothes, like everyone else. Me try to act like human, but me feel like me stuck in skin that not me own. Me want to run, to feel wind in me hair, to smell trees. Me want to be free.

But me no can. Me have to go to school, to pretend to be normal. Me sit in class, listening to Mrs. Lee, trying to focus. Me doodle in notebook, drawing trees and leaves. Me feel like me drawing escape.

At lunchtime, me sit with Emily, eating rice and noodles. Emily ask me about math homework, and me try to help. Me struggle with numbers, but me try. Me want to be good student, to make Emily proud.

After lunch, me go to gym class. Me love running, love feeling wind in me hair. Me try to run fast, to feel free. But me no can. Me have to stop, to pretend to be human. Me watch as other students play soccer, feeling like me stuck in cage.

Me go home, feeling frustrated. Me want to run, to feel alive. Me sit in room, staring at trees outside. Me talk to trees, telling them me problems. Me feel like they understand.

Me realize, me no alone. Me have friends in forest, friends who understand. Me feel like me can be me self, without fear of being discovered. Me make plan, to sneak out of school, to visit forest. Me can't wait.

Me put on backpack, and me sneak out of school. Me run through streets, feeling wind in me hair. Me feel alive, free. Me reach forest, and me run, feeling like me home. Me talk to trees, feeling like me self.

Me realize, me no need to hide. Me can be me self, in Hong Kong or forest. Me can be Wong Wing, wood elf, and me can be happy. [end of text]
