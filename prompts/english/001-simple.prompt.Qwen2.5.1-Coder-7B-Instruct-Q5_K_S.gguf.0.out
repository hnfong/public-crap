1. To determine how high you would have to count before using the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number, we need to consider the numbers from 1 to 99. The numbers that contain the letter "A" are:

   - 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99

   The first number that contains the letter "A" is 10. Therefore, you would have to count up to 10 before using the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number.

3. Here is a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood:

   Once upon a time, three little pigs built their houses with different materials. The first pig built his house with straw, the second pig built his house with sticks, and the third pig built his house with bricks. The first pig's house was the weakest, the second pig's house was a bit stronger, and the third pig's house was the strongest.

   One day, a big bad wolf came to the village and heard that the third pig had the strongest house. He decided to visit the third pig and trick him into inviting him into his house. The third pig was very kind and invited the wolf into his house.

   The wolf pretended to be the third pig's friend and asked him to bring him some food. The third pig was happy to help and brought the wolf some delicious food. The wolf ate all the food and then asked the third pig to bring him more food.

   The third pig was worried but still happy to help. He brought the wolf more food, but the wolf ate it all. The third pig was now very worried and asked the wolf to leave his house. The wolf pretended to be sorry and asked the third pig to let him stay for the night.

   The third pig was still worried but decided to let the wolf stay for the night. The wolf climbed up to the roof of the house and knocked on the chimney. The third pig was surprised and asked the wolf what he wanted. The wolf said that he wanted to go to the fireplace to warm up.

   The third pig was now very worried and asked the wolf to leave. The wolf climbed down the chimney and ran away. The third pig was relieved and locked his house up tight.

   The next morning, the first and second pigs came to visit the third pig. They were surprised to see that his house was still standing. They asked him how he built such a strong house. The third pig told them that he built his house with bricks, which made it very strong.

   The first and second pigs were impressed and decided to build their own houses with bricks. They were able to build houses that were just as strong as the third pig's house. From that day on, they lived happily ever after. [end of text]
