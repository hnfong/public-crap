1. To determine how high you would have to count before using the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number, we need to consider the numbers from 1 to 99. The numbers that contain the letter "A" are:

   - 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19
   - 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29
   - 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39
   - 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49
   - 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59
   - 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69
   - 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79
   - 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89
   - 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99

   Therefore, you would have to count up to 99 before using the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number.

2. The sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is famous for being a pangram, which means it contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once. It is often used for typing practice and font display.

3. Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived three little pigs. The first pig was very lazy and built his house out of straw. The second pig was a bit more industrious and built his house out of sticks. The third pig was the most responsible and built his house out of bricks.

   One day, a big bad wolf came to the village and decided to blow down the houses of the lazy pigs. He started with the straw house, but it was too weak and fell down easily. Then he tried to blow down the stick house, but it was a bit stronger and held up for a while. Finally, he came to the brick house, which was very sturdy and could not be blown down.

   The third pig was very happy and invited the wolf to come inside for a nice meal. The wolf was so hungry that he agreed, and the three pigs served him a delicious meal. After eating, the wolf was so full that he fell asleep and never bothered the pigs again.

   From that day on, the three little pigs lived happily ever after, and the lazy pig learned the importance of hard work and responsibility. [end of text]
