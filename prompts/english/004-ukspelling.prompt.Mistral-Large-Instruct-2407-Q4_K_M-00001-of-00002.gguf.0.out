 In a small village nestled between rolling green hills, there lived a little girl named Lily. Lily loved rainbows more than anything else. She thought they were magical bridges that connected the earth to the sky.

One sunny afternoon, after a quick spring shower, Lily spotted the most beautiful rainbow she had ever seen. It stretched across the sky like a colourful smile, with bright red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet stripes. The colours were so vivid that they seemed to dance in the sunlight.

Lily's favourite part of the rainbow was where the green and blue met. It reminded her of the lush forests and sparkling streams near her home. She imagined that if she could climb up to that spot, she would find a hidden world filled with fairies and unicorns.

As Lily watched, the rainbow began to fade, but the memory of its beauty stayed with her forever. From that day forward, every time it rained, Lily would look up at the sky, hoping to catch another glimpse of her favourite rainbow. [end of text]
