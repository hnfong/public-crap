Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one!

**1. How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?**

You'd have to count to **one hundred and one** (101) before you use the letter "A" in the English spelling of a whole number.  Before that, numbers like "one," "two," "three," etc., don't contain the letter "A."

**2. Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox ..."; What is the sentence famous for?**

"The quick brown fox **jumps over the lazy dog.**"

This sentence is famous because it's a **pangram** – it contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once. It's often used to test typewriters, computer fonts, and keyboard layouts.

**3. Write a short story of the three little pigs who met Little Red Riding Hood.**

The three little pigs, having finally outsmarted the Big Bad Wolf, were enjoying a peaceful afternoon when they heard a rustle in the woods. Out stepped Little Red Riding Hood, basket swinging, looking a bit flustered.

"Oh dear," she sighed, "I'm terribly lost. And I'm supposed to deliver these treats to my grandmother, but I've taken a wrong turn."

The first little pig, who'd built his house of straw, scoffed. "Lost? Serves you right for wandering in the woods! The wolf could be lurking anywhere."

The second little pig, whose house was made of sticks, rolled his eyes. "Don't be rude. Maybe we can help." He offered her a carrot from his garden.

The third little pig, the one with the brick house, was the most sensible. "Come with me," he said. "My house is strong, and we can figure out the way to your grandmother's together."

Little Red Riding Hood gratefully accepted, and the three pigs escorted her through the woods, keeping a watchful eye out for any trouble. They even shared some of their apples with her. When they finally reached her grandmother's cottage, Little Red Riding Hood thanked them profusely.

"You're much kinder than that wolf," she said with a smile. "Perhaps if he'd built a brick house, he wouldn't have had so much trouble!" The pigs chuckled, happy to have helped, and went back to their peaceful lives, knowing that even a little girl in a red hood could appreciate a sturdy home and a kind heart.
