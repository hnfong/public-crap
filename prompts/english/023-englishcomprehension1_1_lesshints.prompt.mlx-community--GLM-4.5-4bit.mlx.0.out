==========
Based on the passage and the hint, my best guess for the date this was written is **April 1, 2023**.

### Explanation

The hint is the key to solving this puzzle. It states that the "distinctive writing style" is connected to "one particular day and month of the year." This strongly suggests the article is not a genuine expression of opinion but a piece of satire written for a specific occasion. The most famous day for satire, hoaxes, and elaborate jokes in the tech world and Western culture is **April 1st, or April Fools' Day**.

Here is a breakdown of how the article's "distinctive writing style" fits the April Fools' Day theme:

**1. The Over-the-Top, Contrarian Stance:**
The article takes a position that is the polar opposite of the prevailing wisdom in the programming community, especially in the circles that would be reading about Rust and GUI toolkits. The author claims to be abandoning Rust, a language celebrated for its memory safety and modern tooling, in favor of C++, a language often criticized for its historical safety issues and complex build systems. This dramatic, almost unbelievable reversal is a classic April Fools' setup. It's designed to provoke a reaction of "Wait, is this person serious?"

**2. The Use of "Straw Man" Arguments and Deliberate Understatement:**
The arguments presented in favor of C++ and against Rust are framed in a way that is technically plausible but logically weak or intentionally overlooks major counterpoints. This is a hallmark of satire.

*   **On Build Systems:** The author praises the "many choices" in C++ (CMake, Meson, Autotools, SCons) as a strength, while calling Cargo's dominance a "near-monoculture" and a "limiting aspect." Anyone who has worked with C++ build systems knows that this "choice" is often a source of immense frustration, complexity, and compatibility nightmares, whereas Cargo's uniformity is one of Rust's most praised features. The author even mentions `make` being useful for "Unix systems such as AIX and DEC OSF/1 AXP," which are decades out of mainstream use. This is a humorous, hyper-specific detail meant to make the argument sound serious while actually highlighting the archaic nature of some C++ tooling.
*   **On Safety:** This section is the most satirical. The author dismisses Rust's primary value proposition—memory safety—with breathtaking nonchalance.
    *   "I consider myself a good enough programmer that I can avoid writing code with safety problems." This is a classic hubris-filled statement that directly contradicts the core philosophy of Rust, which is that *everyone*, no matter how skilled, makes mistakes.
    *   "If a GUI program crashes, it’s not that big a deal." This is a massive understatement. Crashes in GUI applications lead to data loss, user frustration, and security vulnerabilities.
    *   "our customers will understand that it’s not our fault." This is a comically naive view of customer relations.
*   **On Language Evolution:** The author praises C++'s "rapid adoption of new features" and "backwards compatibility breaking changes" as a positive, while framing Rust's commitment to stability ("not break existing code") as a hindrance that makes its innovation "sedate." This is a complete inversion of the common narrative. Rust's stability is seen as a feature for reliable long-term development, whereas C++'s breaking changes are often a source of pain. The mention of "stackful coroutines" in C++26 is a particularly funny touch, as Rust has had robust, production-ready `async`/`await` (stackless coroutines) for years, making the "sedate" claim even more ironic.

**3. The "Tell" in the Community Section:**
This section contains the most obvious clues that the entire piece is a joke.
*   "I hear that the Rust community can be extremely imperious, constantly demanding that projects be rewritten in Rust..." This is a common stereotype, but the author's solution is to move to the C++ community, which they claim will be "much nicer and friendlier." This is highly debatable, but the next line is the punchline: "**In particular, the C++ subreddit is well known for their sense of humor.**" This is a direct, self-aware wink to the reader. The `/r/cpp` subreddit is indeed known for its memes and in-jokes, and referencing it is a clear signal that the author is part of the "in-the-know" online programming culture that celebrates April Fools' Day.
*   The paragraph dismissing diversity policies as "politics" and stating that "in computer science, we have moved beyond prejudice and discrimination" is such a profoundly out-of-touch and controversial statement that it cannot be taken at face value. It's a caricature of a certain type of technolibertarian viewpoint, included to make the satire even more biting and absurd.

**4. The Call to Action and Final Details:**
The article ends with a serious-sounding call for help on a "C++ rewrite" and a link to discuss it on "Hacker News and /r/rust." This is the final part of the prank, designed to send readers to these forums to see the real-time reactions and debate, amplifying the joke's reach.

### Why April 1, 2023?

While the style points to any April 1st, we can narrow it down by looking at the technical details mentioned.
*   The author mentions "C++20 brings us modules" and looks forward to "C++26." C++20 was finalized in 2020, and by 2022-2023, major compilers (MSVC, GCC, Clang) had significant but still incomplete support for modules. Talking about them as an "innovative new feature" that you are "looking forward to actually being implemented fairly soon" fits perfectly with the state of the technology in early 2023.
*   The mention of "Herb Sutter cppfront" and the "new C++ compatible Carbon language" were very hot topics in the C++ world in 2022. Carbon was announced by Google in July 2022, and `cppfront` was being actively discussed. Placing the article in early 2023, after these ideas had circulated but were still very new, makes the most sense.

In conclusion, the article is a masterfully crafted April Fools' joke. Its "distinctive writing style" is one of elaborate satire, using a contrarian persona, straw-man arguments, and subtle (and not-so-subtle) winks to the reader to create a believable-but-absurd narrative that is perfectly suited for April 1st. The technical references anchor this satire specifically in the context of early 2023.
