 1. The main thesis of the text is that God creates everything, including all possibilities and experiences. We, as vessels for experiencing God's creation, have subjective experiences (qualia) and choose what we experience, including suffering and evil, through our beliefs and perceptions.

2. I do not entirely agree with the thesis. While it's true that our perceptions and beliefs shape our experiences, the text oversimplifies the complex issue of suffering. It overlooks the systemic and external causes of suffering, which are not merely a matter of personal choice or perception.

3.
In God's vast canvas, we reside,
Our experiences, we confide.
Yet, suffering isn't just a choice,
It's a cry, a plea, a haunting voice. [end of text]
