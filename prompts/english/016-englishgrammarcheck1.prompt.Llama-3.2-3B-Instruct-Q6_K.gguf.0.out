So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

Here are the issues I found in the text:

**Grammar Mistakes:**

1. "I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking" should be "I'm sure that most tech workers are mostly diligent and hardworking" (subject-verb agreement error)
2. "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations" should be "I had no doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day-to-day operations" (verb tense consistency)
3. "I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude" should be "I didn't make any trades, only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude" (missing conjunction)
4. "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose" should be "In America, we trust that they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose" (subject-verb agreement error and missing article)
5. "I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years" should be "I'm not sure I can accurately predict what Google will be like in 15 years" (proper noun capitalization and subject-verb agreement error)

**Tense Issues:**

1. The text switches between past tense ("back when tech stocks were down last year") and present tense ("the party's gonna end sooner or later") without clear connection or explanation.
2. The text uses the phrase "I had no ounce of doubt" in the past tense, but then switches to the present tense in the next sentence.
3. The text mentions "early 2023" as a specific year, but then uses the phrase "in say 15 years" which implies a future tense.

**Agreement Issues:**

1. "people in big tech companies" should be "tech workers in big tech companies" (subject-verb agreement error)
2. "I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking" should be "most tech workers are mostly diligent and hardworking" (subject-verb agreement error)
3. "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs" should be "I had no doubt that they can cut costs" (subject-verb agreement error)
4. "I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like" should be "I'm not sure I can accurately predict what Google will be like" (subject-verb agreement error)

**Serious Stylistic Issues:**

1. The text uses a mix of informal and formal language, which can be jarring. For example, the use of "I'm sure" and "I had no ounce of doubt" in the same paragraph.
2. The text includes a lot of colloquial expressions and slang (e.g. "frugally", "enough", "geographically misplaced") that may not be clear to non-native English speakers or readers unfamiliar with the author's tone.
3. The text jumps abruptly from discussing the topic of tech companies to the author's personal financial situation and career aspirations.
4. The text uses a lot of rhetorical flourishes (e.g. "the ruthless capitalist engine", "the party's gonna end sooner or later") that may come across as overly dramatic or attention-seeking.
5. The text includes a lot of tangential comments and asides (e.g. "we're still sane though, just unique circumstances") that may not be clear or relevant to the main topic.

**Other Problems:**

1. The text includes a lot of typos and grammatical errors (e.g. "levels.fyi", "en-shittification").
2. The text uses a lot of vague or ambiguous language (e.g. "the party's gonna end sooner or later", "the golden goose").
3. The text includes a lot of references to specific companies and events (e.g. "GOOG", "McKinsey Pichai") that may not be clear or relevant to the main topic.
4. The text uses a lot of jargon and technical terms (e.g. "FI", "antitrust") that may not be clear to non-experts.
5. The text includes a lot of self-referential comments and asides (e.g. "people who know approximately how much I make") that may come across as self-indulgent or attention-seeking. [end of text]
