The Whispering Hallways

I’m Li Wing-sum, sixteen, Form 4, and I’m a wood elf.  
At least, that’s what I am when no one’s looking.

Most people think elves are tall, pointy-eared, and live in forests with talking trees. I’m 1.6 metres, my ears are normal, and the only tree that talks to me is the one outside my bedroom window—Grandma’s bonsai, which I named “Old Man”. He only whispers when I’m lonely, so I talk back in Cantonese. He says, “早呀, 細路仔,” and I say, “早呀, 大佬.” It’s our secret.

At school, I hide it the way you hide a pimple before the photo day. I sit in the back row, keep my sleeves long, and never raise my hand unless the teacher calls on me. My best friend is Chan Hoi-yan, who thinks “elf” is short for “elderly friend”. She doesn’t know I can hear the wind in the eaves of the science block, or that I can smell the sap in the wooden desks. When she laughs, I smell pine and sunshine, and I want to hug her, but elves don’t hug—they bow, three times, like in the old stories. So I just smile and pretend my heart isn’t thudding like a woodpecker.

Our school has a big courtyard with a single banyan tree in the middle. It’s not much, but it’s enough. At lunch, I sit under it and press my palm to the bark. The tree remembers the typhoon last year, the time the cleaners trimmed its branches too short, and the way the Form 6 prefects used to sneak cigarettes behind it. I listen, and sometimes I sing to it in a low voice. The leaves rustle back, “唔该.” Thank you.

One Tuesday, the new English teacher, Mr. Davies, announced we had to do a “community project”. He split us into groups of four and told us to pick a spot on campus to improve. My group—me, Yan, two boys from Science—chose the banyan. We were supposed to plant flowers, but I knew the tree didn’t need flowers. It needed roots. So I suggested we clear the weeds and add compost. Mr. Davies frowned, but he said, “Fine, as long as you keep a record.”

That night, I brought a small tin of soil from home—composted oak leaves and dried moss. I mixed it with the school’s dirt and spread it around the roots. Yan helped, humming the tune from our favourite anime. The boys complained about the smell, but I told them it was “organic”. They didn’t ask questions.

The next morning, the banyan looked greener. Not just greener—alive. The leaves shimmered like emeralds, and when the wind blew, they whispered, “多謝.” I felt my own ears tingle, the way they do when I’m near old magic. Yan noticed. “Wing-sum,” she said, “your eyes are… sparkly today.” I blinked and looked away. “Maybe I’m just tired.”

Word spread. The other classes wanted to “adopt” the tree. Mr. Davies posted pictures on the school website. Someone wrote, “The banyan looks like it’s smiling.” I smiled too, but inside I was panicking. Elves don’t like being noticed. We fade into forests, not Instagram feeds.

Then came the day of the inter-class competition. Each group had to present their project. Our turn came. Yan held up the poster: “Banyan Restoration Project – Wing-sum’s Group”. I stood behind her, clutching the microphone like it was a sword. My palms were sweaty. Knees weak, arms spaghetti. (I’d practiced that line in the mirror, but it didn’t help.)

Mr. Davies asked me to speak. I took a breath. “We… we wanted to give the tree a home,” I said. “It’s been here longer than any of us. It gives us shade, oxygen, and… stories.” I glanced at the banyan. Its leaves rustled, and I swear I heard, “好樣的.” Good job.

The judges nodded. The other groups had posters and charts. We had a tree that looked happier than ever. We won. The whole school clapped, and someone shouted, “Wing-sum for president!” I laughed, but my heart was thudding again. I looked at Yan. She was grinning like the Cheshire Cat. “You did good, elf-boy,” she whispered. I froze. “What did you say?”

She rolled her eyes. “I know, okay? The way you always know when it’s going to rain, the way you smell like pine when you’re happy, the way you bowed to Old Man when you thought no one was looking. I’m not stupid.”

I wanted to deny it, to laugh it off, but the words stuck in my throat like a fishbone. Instead, I did what elves do when cornered: I stepped back, lowered my head, and said, “對唔住.” Sorry.

Yan grabbed my shoulders. “Don’t be sorry. Be you. Just… maybe tell me the part where you can talk to squirrels?”

I laughed then, a real laugh, the kind that makes your ribs shake. “Only the noisy ones.”

That afternoon, we sat under the banyan again. Yan brought two cans of lemon tea. I told her everything—except the part about Old Man, because some secrets are too big for words. Instead, I let the tree speak for me. Its leaves whispered to her, soft and slow: “佢係好人.” He’s a good person.

Yan listened, eyes wide. Then she said, “Next time, bring me to the forest. I want to meet your grandma.”

I smiled, and for the first time, I didn’t feel like hiding. The wind carried the scent of pine and sunshine, and I knew the banyan was smiling too.

After all, every elf needs a place to belong. Even if it’s just a single tree in a concrete schoolyard. [end of text]
