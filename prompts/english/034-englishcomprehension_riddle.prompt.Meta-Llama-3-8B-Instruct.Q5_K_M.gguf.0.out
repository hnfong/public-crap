Consider this scenario:

Alice: Are you eating healthy?
Bob: Yes! Today I ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat.
Alice: Wow! Let me see.
Bob: (sends Alice a photo)
Alice: wtf

---
Question: what happened? What did Bob eat and was it healthy?

A delightful scenario!

It seems that Bob is trying to impress Alice with his healthy eating habits, but things didn't quite go as planned.

According to Bob, he ate "aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat." However, when Alice sees the photo, she's left speechless, responding with "wtf" (which is internet slang for "what the...?").

It's likely that the photo shows something that doesn't quite match Bob's description. Perhaps the "aged organic milk" is actually a processed cheese product, or the "seasoned tomato purée" is a sugary ketchup. Maybe the "baked whole wheat" is actually a processed white bread.

In any case, it seems that Bob's attempt to showcase his healthy eating habits has backfired, and Alice is left wondering what's really going on in that photo!
