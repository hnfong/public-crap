1. The main thesis of the text is that suffering and evil are subjective experiences created by individuals through their choices and perspectives. The author argues that these experiences are not inherent in the world but are rather a result of how we perceive and interpret our surroundings.

2. I agree with the author's perspective. The text emphasizes that our subjective experiences, including suffering and evil, are shaped by our choices and beliefs. This aligns with the idea that we have agency in our lives and can create our own experiences, even if they may include suffering.

3. Here's a short poem based on the information provided:

In a world of endless possibilities,
We are vessels for God's creation.
Subjective experiences, qualia,
Define us, yet we often ignore.

Suffering and evil, we choose to see,
Through our lens, our reality takes shape.
Beliefs and perceptions, we hold dear,
Shape our subjective experiences, we steer.

So let us embrace our agency,
And choose to see the world anew.
For in our choices, we find power,
To create our own subjective hour. [end of text]
