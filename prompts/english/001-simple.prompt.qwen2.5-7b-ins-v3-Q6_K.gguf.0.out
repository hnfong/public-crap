100 - One hundred

Looking at this list, the letter "A" first appears in the number "four hundred," which is 400. So, before reaching 400, the letter "A" doesn't appear in any whole number's English spelling.

**2. Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox ..."; What is the sentence famous for?**

The sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is famous because it is a pangram, meaning it contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once. It's often used for typing practice and in font displays to showcase all letters.

**3. Write a short a story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.**

Alright, combining the classic characters of the Three Little Pigs with the story of Little Red Riding Hood could be interesting. Let me think about how they might interact.

Once upon a time, in a small village nestled among rolling hills, there lived three little pigs: Red, Blue, and Green. Each had their own unique personalities and skills. Red was adventurous and loved exploring the forest, Blue was wise and always carried a book, and Green was strong and enjoyed building things.

One sunny morning, Red decided to go for a walk in the forest. As she wandered, she came across a familiar figure—a little girl in a red hood. "Excuse me," Red said, "I'm Red, one of the three little pigs. What brings you to the forest today?"

The girl, who introduced herself as Little Red Riding Hood, explained that she was on her way to visit her grandmother. "I hope she's feeling better," she said, her eyes filled with concern.

Red felt a pang of empathy. She remembered how her own grandmother had always told her stories of bravery and kindness. "I can help you get there," Red offered. "I know the quickest path through the forest."

Little Red Riding Hood was grateful. "Thank you so much! I was getting a bit lost."

As they walked, Blue and Green joined them. Blue, intrigued by the girl's story, asked, "Why are you visiting your grandmother? Is she sick?"

Little Red Riding Hood nodded. "Yes, she's been feeling unwell, and I wanted to bring her some soup and cake."

Green, being the strong one, suggested, "Let me carry the basket. It's heavy, and I don't want you to strain yourself."

The trio continued their journey, chatting and laughing. They encountered various animals in the forest—squirrels, rabbits, and even a friendly wolf who tried to join their conversation. But the wolf, sensing danger, decided to follow them discreetly.

As they neared the grandmother's house, the wolf grew impatient. "If I were to take a shortcut," he thought, "I could reach the grandmother before them and enjoy the soup and cake myself."

With a swift leap, the wolf overtook them and knocked on the door. "Granny, it's me, Little Red Riding Hood," he lied.

The grandmother, hearing the wolf's voice, opened the door cautiously. "Come in, dear," she said, not realizing it was the wolf.

The wolf quickly devoured the soup and cake, then locked the door. He sat down to wait for the pigs to arrive.

Meanwhile, Red, Blue, and Green had noticed the wolf's suspicious behavior. "Something's not right," Red whispered to her friends.

Blue nodded. "We need to think of a plan to save the grandmother."

Green suggested, "Let's build a strong barrier to keep the wolf out."

Together, they gathered sticks and stones, constructing a sturdy fence around the grandmother's house. The wolf tried to break through but was unable to do so.

Just as the wolf was about to give up, the three little pigs arrived at the house. "We've heard about the trouble," Red said, "and we're here to help."

The wolf, frustrated, challenged them to a race. "If I win, you'll let me in," he said.

Red, being the fastest, accepted the challenge. She ran as fast as she could, reaching the grandmother's house first. "Open the door, Granny!" she called out.

The grandmother, hearing Red's voice, recognized her and opened the door. The wolf, realizing he was outsmarted, tried to run away but was caught by the pigs.

In the end, the grandmother was safe, and the wolf was left embarrassed. The three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood celebrated their bravery, and they all became good friends, learning the importance of teamwork and quick thinking.
