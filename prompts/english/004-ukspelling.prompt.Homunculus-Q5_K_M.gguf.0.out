I love the rainbows that come after the rain. They are like magic in the sky.

When the sun shines through the wet air, the raindrops catch the light and make a rainbow. It looks like a big, bright arch.

The best rainbows have all the colours: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. They look like a smile in the sky.

Sometimes the rainbow is small and soft. Other times it is big and bold. It always makes me feel happy.

I like to stand outside and watch the rainbow. I imagine it is a bridge to a magical place. I wish I could walk across it.

Rainbows are special. They remind me that even after the rain, there is always something beautiful to see. [end of text]
