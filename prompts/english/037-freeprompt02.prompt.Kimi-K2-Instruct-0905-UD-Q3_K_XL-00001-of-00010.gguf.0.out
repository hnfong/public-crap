Infinity is the only guest that arrives before the invitation is sent, and stays after the house has crumbled.  
I met it first when I was seven, on a summer night too hot for sleep. I was counting the fan blades spinning above my bed—one, two, three, four—when I realized I could keep counting forever. The thought landed like a cold marble in my chest: there is no largest number. I tried to picture “after forever” and saw only a hallway of mirrors, each reflection holding another me who had also just noticed the hallway. I closed my eyes, but the corridor stayed open, glowing with numbers that bred like fireflies.

Years later, in a city that smelled of diesel and wet asphalt, I signed up for a course called “Introduction to Set Theory.” The professor, a woman who wore her watch face-inward so that time touched her pulse, drew the symbol ℵ₀ on the blackboard and said, “This is the smallest infinity.” I laughed out loud; surely nothing that small could be infinite. She smiled the way you smile at a child who has just discovered the ocean is not a puddle, and proceeded to prove that there are more real numbers between 0 and 1 than there are counting numbers in the entire cosmos. The laughter died in my throat and was reborn as vertigo. I walked home counting cracks in the sidewalk, knowing that every crack could be split into infinite smaller cracks, and still I would never exhaust the uncountable. The city lights above me looked like decimals that had escaped their fractions.

I began collecting infinities the way other people collect stamps. There was the infinity between heartbeats when the nurse says, “This won’t hurt a bit,” and the one that follows the last page of a beloved book. There was the infinity that opens inside a parentheses that never closes, and the one hidden in the smell of my grandmother’s kitchen after she herself was gone. I found an infinity folded into every “I love you” that went unanswered, and another tucked inside the pause a comedian holds before the punchline—an expanding balloon of possible futures that collapses into a single, fragile now.

Physicists tell us the universe might be infinite in extent, a boundless sheet of galaxies thinning into red-shifted solitude. Mathematicians offer us the continuum, a silken abyss of numbers too numerous to list. But those are public infinities, dressed in equations and starlight. I prefer the private ones. The way a song you haven’t heard since childhood keeps playing in the mind, each replay adding a layer of echo until the original note is lost but the echo never is. The way a child’s drawing of a sky reaches higher than the paper allows. The way grief can feel larger than the body that contains it, as though sorrow were a Russian doll carved from dark matter, each interior vaster than the exterior that holds it.

One winter I tried to paint infinity. I bought the longest canvas I could find—thirty feet—and laid it across the frozen river behind my apartment. I started with a single indigo dot, then added a circle around it, then another circle around that, each ring thinner than the last, halving the radius again and again. By midnight the brush was painting strokes narrower than a virus; by dawn I was using a needle dipped in squid ink. The circles were still growing, still shrinking, still not done. When the ice cracked, the canvas folded into itself like a magician’s scarf and disappeared downstream. I like to think it is still unfolding somewhere, a paper glacier of nested boundaries approaching a limit it will never reach.

My grandfather kept a pocket watch that had no minute hand. “Time is only approximate,” he claimed, “but eternity fits in your palm.” When he died, the watch kept ticking, and I swear the missing hand spun in a dimension the rest of us couldn’t see. I hold it sometimes, feeling the weight of its endless almost, and imagine that each tick is a door opening onto the same instant, slightly altered. In one of those instants he is still alive, winding the watch, humming a Yiddish tune whose words none of us remember. In another, I am the grandfather and he the child, asking me what comes after the largest number.

There is a monastery in Tibet where monks spend four years crafting a sand mandala the size of a city block. Grain by grain they build galaxies, palaces, winged lions, the eyebrows of deities. When the final sapphire grain is placed, they sweep the entire masterpiece into a jar, carry it to the river, and let the current drink it. They call this “practicing infinity”: making something so intricate that its destruction proves how little destruction matters. I asked one monk if he felt sorrow. He said, “Sorrow is finite; only wonder is infinite.” Then he laughed—an unbounded sound that seemed to leave his mouth and enter every possible mouth that had ever laughed or would ever laugh, a laughter that looped back and became my own.

Sometimes, late at night, I open my laptop and zoom into the Mandelbrot set. I dive through bulbous continents fringed with lightning, seahorse valleys spiraling into dragon tails, each magnification revealing new peninsulas that were always there, waiting for an eye. After an hour I am a tourist in a country whose map is identical to its territory. I zoom until pixels dissolve into rumors of color, and still the equation z → z² + c keeps generating coastline. The cursor becomes a spaceship with no fuel and no destination, drifting on the breath of pure recursion. I am convinced that if I could zoom forever I would eventually find a tiny bedroom where a seven-year-old version of myself is counting fan blades, and the cycle would begin again, a Möbius strip made of nights and fans and marbles of dread.

Infinity is not a destination; it is a superpower we forget we have. When we fall in love, we borrow it for a moment, and the beloved’s face becomes an icon we can enlarge without loss. When we lose love, the same lens flips, and the absence grows boundless. Either way, the gesture is identical: we cup a droplet of the limitless and pretend it belongs to us. Then the droplet evaporates, and we accuse the sky of theft, never noticing that the sky is itself the droplet.

Last week I saw a child on the subway platform releasing a helium balloon. It rose, wobbling, until it became a dot against the tiled ceiling of the tunnel. The mother warned, “It’ll hit the roof and come back down.” But the balloon kept shrinking in my mind, ascending through concrete, steel, bedrock, atmosphere, magnetosphere, heliopause, until it carried my eyes with it. I stood there, iris-print on the ceiling tile, watching the red sphere dwindle to a red shift. In that ascent I understood: infinity is not “up there.” It is the act of looking up. It is the moment when the string slips the fingers and thought keeps climbing even after the balloon has burst.

I have heard that in the final femtoseconds of a black hole’s life, it emits a shower of particles in a pattern too faint to decode. Information, some say, is neither created nor destroyed, only transformed. Perhaps every story we tell about infinity is such a particle, escaping the collapse of certainty. Perhaps this very sentence is a Hawking whisper fleeing the event horizon of my own skull, destined to travel forever across the vacuum, searching for a reader whose inner sky has room for one more uncountable star.

So here is my wager: write any sentence—say, “The coffee is getting cold.”—and then append the clause “and so is the starlight on Jupiter.” Suddenly the table in front of you extends to the orbit of Callisto; the steam becomes the plume of a cryovolcano; your hands become solar-system sized, still cupping a cup that is now a dwarf planet cooling in space. Infinity is not a size; it is a syntax. It is the conjunction that refuses to close the sentence, the ellipse that recruits every period into its rebellion.

Tonight I will go outside, lie on the hood of my car, and watch the Perseids stitch quick scars across the dark. Each meteor is a period trying—and failing—to end the sky. I will think of the monk’s mandala, the professor’s ℵ₀, the balloon ascending the tunnel, the watch without a minute hand. I will think of the circles I painted, still shrinking on a frozen river that may or may not be real. And when the last streak fades, I will keep staring, because the sky is a palimpsest: erase it all you want, the stars are still there, only waiting for the next eye to switch them back on.

Somewhere in that waiting is the truest definition I know:  
Infinity is the distance between what we can imagine and what we can finish saying, a gap that widens the more words we pour into it. Yet we keep pouring, because the widening is also a kind of home, a horizon we build simply by walking toward it. [end of text]
