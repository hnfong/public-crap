### 1. Explain the main thesis of the text in at most 3 sentences.  
The text argues that all existence is God’s creation, and suffering is not imposed by God but is a result of our subjective choices to experience it—we create our own reality by choosing what to perceive and believe, and we always have the power to change our experience.

### 2. Do you agree? Explain but be concise.  
I partially agree—while subjective experience shapes how we perceive suffering, it doesn’t negate the real-world impact of systemic or external suffering. Choosing to change perception is empowering, but it doesn’t replace the need for action to alleviate tangible pain.

### 3. Write a short poem (ideally that rhymes) based on the information above.  

We choose the lens through which we see,  
The pain, the joy, the world’s decree.  
God’s all, and we are vessels, true—  
Our minds shape what we make of you.  

The suffering we call “evil” or “wrong”  
Is a choice to believe it, to carry its song.  
But change is near, if we dare to shift—  
In space, in time, we can turn the gift.  

For here, right now, we are where we’ve been,  
Because we chose to be, again, again.  
The world is ours to feel, to grow—  
In every moment, we can let go. [end of text]
