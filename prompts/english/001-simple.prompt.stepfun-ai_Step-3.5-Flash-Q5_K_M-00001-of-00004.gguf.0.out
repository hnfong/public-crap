Okay, let's tackle these questions one by one.

First question: How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?  
Hmm, thinking about number words. "One" has no A, "two" no A, "three" no A, "four" no A, "five" no A, "six" no A, "seven" no A, "eight" no A, "nine" no A, "ten" no A. Then "eleven" no A, "twelve" no A. "Thirteen" no A, "fourteen" no A, "fifteen" no A, "sixteen" no A, "seventeen" no A, "eighteen" no A, "nineteen" no A. "Twenty" no A, "thirty" no A, "forty" no A, "fifty" no A, "sixty" no A, "seventy" no A, "eighty" no A, "ninety" no A. Then "hundred" has an A! Wait, but "hundred" is part of numbers like "one hundred". But the question says "spelling of a whole number", so does "one hundred" count? The word "hundred" itself contains an A. But is "hundred" considered a whole number? Typically, whole numbers are 0,1,2,... so "one hundred" is 100. But the spelling of 100 is "one hundred", which includes "hundred" with an A. But maybe they mean the number word itself without "and"? Let's check smaller numbers. What about "thousand"? That has an A too. But before "hundred", are there any numbers with A? Let's list systematically:  
Units: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.  
Teens: eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen.  
Tens: twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety.  
Then combinations: twenty-one, etc., but those use "twenty" and "one", no A.  
Hundreds: one hundred, two hundred, etc. The word "hundred" has an A. So the first occurrence is at 100? But wait, is "a hundred" considered? But "a" is an article, not part of the number word. Typically, we say "one hundred". So 100 is "one hundred", which includes "hundred" with A. But what about 101? "One hundred one" still has "hundred". So the first number whose spelling contains the letter A is 100? But let's double-check: Is there any number before 100 that has A? What about "and"? In some styles, like "one hundred and one", but that's not standard for whole numbers? The question says "spelling of a whole number", so probably without "and". So "one hundred" is the first. But wait, "thousand" has A, but that's larger. So answer should be 100? But I recall that the first number with A is actually 101? No, because "hundred" has A. But maybe they consider "one hundred" as two words, and "hundred" is the part with A. So the number is 100. But let's confirm: "hundred" is spelled H-U-N-D-R-E-D, which has an A? Wait, H-U-N-D-R-E-D: letters are H, U, N, D, R, E, D. No A! Oh! I made a mistake. "Hundred" does not have an A! It's H-U-N-D-R-E-D. No A. So what about "thousand"? T-H-O-U-S-A-N-D, that has an A! So "thousand" has an A. But is there any number before 1000 that has A? Let's check "and"? But "and" is not part of the number word typically. So numbers like 101: "one hundred one" no A. 110: "one hundred ten" no A. 200: "two hundred" no A. So up to 999, no A? But what about "eight"? No A. "eighty"? No A. "eighty-eight"? No A. So the first number with A might be 1000? "One thousand" has "thousand" with A. But wait, "thousand" is T-H-O-U-S-A-N-D, yes A. But is there any number between 100 and 1000 that has A? What about "million"? That's larger. So 1000? But let's think about "a thousand"? But "a" is not part of the number. So the number word for 1000 is "one thousand", which contains "thousand" with A. But what about 1001? Still "thousand". So the first occurrence is at 1000? But I recall that the first number with A is actually 101? No, because "hundred" has no A. Wait, maybe I missed something: "fourteen"? F-O-U-R-T-E-E-N, no A. "fifteen"? F-I-F-T-E-E-N, no A. "sixteen"? S-I-X-T-E-E-N, no A. "seventeen"? S-E-V-E-N-T-E-E-N, no A. "eighteen"? E-I-G-H-T-E-E-N, no A. "nineteen"? N-I-N-E-T-E-E-N, no A. "twenty"? T-W-E-N-T-Y, no A. "thirty"? T-H-I-R-T-Y, no A. "forty"? F-O-R-T-Y, no A. "fifty"? F-I-F-T-Y, no A. "sixty"? S-I-X-T-Y, no A. "seventy"? S-E-V-E-N-T-Y, no A. "eighty"? E-I-G-H-T-Y, no A. "ninety"? N-I-N-E-T-Y, no A. So indeed, up to 99, no A. Then 100: "one hundred" - "hundred" no A. 101: "one hundred one" no A. So up to 999, all use "hundred" which has no A. Then 1000: "one thousand" - "thousand" has A. So the first number is 1000? But wait, what about "a thousand"? But that's not the number word; the number word is "one thousand". So answer should be 1000. But I think I've heard that the first number with A is 101? Let me double-check "hundred": H-U-N-D-R-E-D. Yes, no A. So 1000 is correct. But let's confirm "thousand": T-H-O-U-S-A-N-D. Yes, there's an A. So the answer is 1000.

Second question: Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox ..."; What is the sentence famous for?  
This is a pangram. The full sentence is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." It's famous for containing every letter of the alphabet at least once. So it's used for testing typewriters, fonts, etc.

Third question: Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.  
Need to combine the two fairy tales. The three little pigs build houses, and Little Red Riding Hood goes through the forest to her grandmother's house. They could meet in the forest. Perhaps the wolf from the pigs' story is the same as the wolf in Red Riding Hood? That would make sense. So the wolf tries to trick both. The pigs might help Red Riding Hood. Or maybe the pigs are already in their houses when Red passes by. Let's create a short story: The three little pigs have built their houses. Red Riding Hood is on her way to grandmother's with a basket. She meets the wolf, who learns where she's going. The wolf goes to grandmother's house, but maybe the pigs see the wolf and warn Red? Or the pigs' houses are in the area. The wolf might try to blow down the pigs' houses but fails on the brick one. Then he goes to grandmother's. But Red might seek help from the pigs. So a combined story: Red meets the wolf, who asks where she's going. She says to grandmother's. The wolf goes ahead, eats grandmother, puts on clothes. Red arrives, notices something wrong. The wolf jumps out. Red screams. The pigs hear the scream, come to help. They chase the wolf away. Or something like that. Keep it short.

So answers:
1. 1000
2. It's a pangram containing all letters of the alphabet.
3. A short story combining the two tales.

**1.** The first whole number whose English spelling contains the letter "A" is **1,000** ("one thousand"). All numbers from 1 to 999 avoid the letter "A" in their standard spellings (e.g., "hundred" has no "A"), but "thousand" introduces the letter.

**2.** The complete sentence is: **"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."** It is famous as a **pangram**—a sentence that uses every letter of the English alphabet at least once. It is commonly used to test fonts, keyboards, and displays.

**3.**  
*The Three Little Pigs Meet Little Red Riding Hood*  

The three little pigs had just finished building their homes—one of straw, one of sticks, and one of sturdy bricks—when they heard a rustling in the forest. Little Red Riding Hood, basket in hand, was skipping along the path to her grandmother’s house. A sly wolf, who had recently failed to blow down the brick house, spotted her and learned of her errand.  

The wolf raced ahead, swallowed Red’s grandmother, and put on her nightgown. When Red arrived, she noticed the wolf’s big eyes, ears, and teeth. Before the wolf could pounce, Red screamed. The pigs, hearing the cry, rushed over. The wolf tried to blow the straw and stick houses down again, but they were empty. He then charged at the brick house, but the pigs held the door fast.  

Red grabbed a nearby branch, and the three pigs together chased the howling wolf into the forest, never to return. Red thanked the pigs, and they escorted her safely to her grandmother’s—now very much alive, having been rescued from the wolf’s belly by the pigs’ timely intervention. From then on, the pigs and Red were the best of friends, sharing stories and keeping watch over the forest together. [end of text]
