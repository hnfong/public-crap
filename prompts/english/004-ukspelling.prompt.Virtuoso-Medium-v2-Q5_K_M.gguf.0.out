Rainbows are magical. They appear after rain. The sun shines through the raindrops. This makes a rainbow.

I like rainbows in parks. The grass is green. Flowers are bright. Children play. They see the rainbow. They smile.

I like rainbows over hills. The hills are green. Sheep graze. The rainbow arches high. It looks like a bridge to the sky.

I like rainbows at the seaside. The sea is blue. Waves crash. Seagulls fly. The rainbow is over the sea. It looks like a bridge to a faraway land.

Rainbows make me happy. They remind me of magic. They remind me of hope. They remind me of beauty. I love rainbows. [end of text]
