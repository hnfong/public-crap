1. In English, the first number that contains the letter "A" in its spelling is "One Thousand". This is because "a" is used in "and" in the British English spelling of 1000 ("One thousand and..."), but in American English, the first number is "One million" as "and" is not used in the British sense.

2. "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a well-known English-language pangram. It's famous because it contains all the letters of the English alphabet, making it useful for typing practice, in font displays, and other applications where all letters of the alphabet are needed.

3. A story combining "The Three Little Pigs" and "Little Red Riding Hood" isn't a traditional or well-known story, as these are two separate fairy tales. A possible short story could be: "In a forest, three little pigs built their houses of straw, sticks, and bricks. One day, Little Red Riding Hood was walking through the woods to her grandmother's house when she met the three pigs. They warned her about the big bad wolf. She took a different path and safely reached her grandmother's house, while the wolf was foiled by the pig in the brick house." This is a creative mix, but the original tales don't intersect. 

Please note, the answer to the first question can vary depending on whether you're using American or British English conventions. In American English, "A" is first used in "One million" as "and" is not used in the British sense for "One thousand". In British English, "A" is first used in "One thousand" due to the use of "and".
