The author claims that God is an all‑encompassing creative principle, and everything that exists—including our subjective qualia—is a manifestation of that creation. Because we are free to choose which aspects of reality to experience, suffering and evil are not objective facts but personal choices of perception or belief. Consequently, any sense of powerlessness is illusory; we can always alter our experience by exercising agency over what we attend to.  

**2. Do I agree?**  
I do not agree. While it is philosophically interesting to treat God as a neutral “law” that generates all possibilities, the claim that suffering is merely a self‑selected illusion ignores the empirical reality of pain, oppression, and systemic harm that affect individuals regardless of their beliefs. Agency is limited by biological, social, and environmental constraints, so framing all evil as a voluntary perception risks dismissing genuine moral responsibility and the need for collective action.  

**3. Poem**

In a cosmos where the Divine is law,  
All worlds are born, both flaw and awe.  
Our minds, a spark of private light,  
Choose what to see—darkness or bright.  

If sorrow walks the path we tread,  
It’s not a curse the cosmos spread,  
But a lens we let our thoughts employ—  
A phantom fear, a self‑made ploy.  

Yet chains of flesh and fate still bind,  
And pain can strike the meek and kind.  
So though we claim we shape the scene,  
Compassion’s call must bridge the dream. [end of text]
