1. You would have to count up to 1,000 before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number. The number is "one thousand".

2. "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." This sentence is famous for using every letter of the English alphabet at least once.

3. Once upon a time, the three little pigs were building their houses in the woods. One day, they met Little Red Riding Hood who was on her way to her grandmother's house. The first pig, who built his house of straw, invited her in, but the wolf, who was also in the woods, heard her and knocked on the door. The pig let her in, but the wolf huffed and puffed and blew the house down. The second pig, who built his house of sticks, invited her in, but the wolf knocked again and huffed and puffed and blew that house down too. The third pig, who built his house of bricks, invited her in. The wolf knocked again, but no matter how hard he huffed and puffed, he couldn't blow that house down. So, he went around to the back door and climbed up the chimney. But the pig had a plan. He put a big pot of boiling water at the bottom of the chimney, and when the wolf fell in, he was boiled alive. The three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood lived happily ever after. The end. [end of text]
