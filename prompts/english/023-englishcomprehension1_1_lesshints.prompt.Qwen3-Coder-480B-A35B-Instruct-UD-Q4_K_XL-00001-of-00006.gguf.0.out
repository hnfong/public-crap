My best guess is that this passage was written on **April 1st** (April Fools' Day).

### Explanation and Use of the Hint:

The key to solving this lies in the **distinctive writing style** and tone of the passage, which strongly suggests it is a **parody or satirical piece**. Here's how the hint about "one particular day and month of the year" leads to the answer:

#### 1. **Tone and Content as a Parody Indicator**
- The author claims to have been a long-time Rust contributor who now "pines for the stable, mature foundation provided by C++" — a dramatic and unexpected reversal.
- The criticisms of Rust (e.g., Cargo being a "monoculture") are exaggerated or strawman-like, while C++ is portrayed in an unusually positive light (ignoring its well-known complexity and safety issues).
- The mention of **DEC OSF/1 AXP** and **AIX** — obscure, legacy systems — is bizarre in a modern context and reads like a joke.
- The author confidently dismisses memory safety concerns, saying GUI crashes "aren’t that big a deal" — an absurd position for any serious systems programmer.
- The praise for the C++ subreddit’s “sense of humor” and the jab at Rust’s “imperious” community reads like a tongue-in-cheek inversion of real community dynamics.

#### 2. **April Fools’ Day Writing Style**
- April Fools' Day (April 1st) is known for satirical announcements, especially in tech communities.
- Many developers and organizations publish fake blog posts, announcements, or rants that mock real issues in exaggerated or humorous ways.
- This passage fits that tradition: it mimics the structure of a sincere, dramatic language switch announcement but includes absurdities and over-the-top praise for C++ that no serious developer would make.

#### 3. **Community Context**
- The Rust and C++ communities are both active online, and April Fools’ jokes are common in programming circles.
- The closing line — “Discuss on Hacker News and /r/rust” — is a telltale sign of self-awareness, inviting readers to engage in the joke.
- The mention of **Herb Sutter’s cppfront** and **Carbon** (real but experimental projects) is used here in a way that exaggerates their relevance, another hallmark of parody.

### Conclusion:
The **distinctive writing style** — overly dramatic, self-contradictory, and absurd in its praise of C++ and dismissal of Rust’s strengths — is a strong signal that this is a **satirical piece**. When combined with the hint pointing to a specific **day and month of the year**, the most logical conclusion is that it was written on **April 1st**, as part of an **April Fools’ joke**.
