Of course. Here are the answers to your questions.

### 1. How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?

You would have to count to **one thousand** (1,000).

The letter "a" first appears in the word "thousand." All numbers below one thousand are spelled without using the letter "a" (e.g., one, two, three, ... nine hundred ninety-nine).

### 2. Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox ..."; What is the sentence famous for?

The complete sentence is: **"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."**

This sentence is famous for being a **pangram**. A pangram is a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet at least once. It is commonly used to display typefaces, test keyboards, and practice handwriting because it forces the use of all letters.

### 3. Write a short a story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.

The three little pigs, now living safely in their sturdy brick house, had become quite bored. The wolf was long gone, and life was peaceful, but terribly dull. One afternoon, they decided to venture into the nearby woods to forage for apples.

Meanwhile, a young girl named Little Red Riding Hood was also in the forest, carrying a basket of treats for her grandmother. She was humming a tune, unaware that a new, cunning wolf had been tracking her scent.

The first little pig, who built his house of straw, was the first to see her. "Hello!" he oinked, popping out from behind a bush and startling her.
"Goodness!" she exclaimed, clutching her basket. "You shouldn't sneak up on people like that!"
"Sorry," he said. "We're just looking for apples. It's so nice to meet someone new!"

Soon, the second pig (of stick-house fame) joined them, and finally, the third, sensible pig in his brick-house overalls arrived. They introduced themselves to Little Red.
"What's in the basket?" asked the second pig, his nose twitching.
"Warm bread, sweet butter, and blackberry wine for my grandmother," she replied. "She lives in a cottage on the other side of these woods."

Just then, the third pig, who was always cautious, sniffed the air. "I smell wolf," he grunted. "It's not our old one. This is different."
A shadow fell over them. The new wolf, sleek and sly, stepped onto the path. "What a lucky find," he snarled. "A snack for now and a feast for later." He eyed the little pigs and then Red's basket.

But the three little pigs were not the naive builders they once were. "Run to that stone wall!" the third pig commanded Red. The pigs formed a line.
The first pig dug his hooves into the dirt. The second pig puffed out his chest. The third pig, the bravest, stepped forward.
"We've dealt with your kind before," he said. "You'll not have our friend nor her basket."

The wolf laughed and lunged. But as he did, the third pig let out a loud, piercing whistle. From behind the trees emerged the Big Bad Wolfâ€”their old nemesis, now lean and retired but still fiercely protective of *his* forest and *his* pigs.
"This is my territory, pup," the older wolf growled. "Find your own."

The new wolf, outmatched and outnumbered, tucked his tail between his legs and fled into the deep forest.
Little Red Riding Hood was astonished. "You... you saved me! Thank you!"
The third pig smiled. "It's what neighbors do. Now, let us escort you to your grandmother's. No one should walk these woods alone."

And so, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood walked together down the path, proving that sometimes, the most unlikely friendships make the strongest protection against any wolf. [end of text]
