Question:

There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block. We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of blue block.

What color is the block we don't know the color of? Only answer in one word. Don't explain.

Question:

In a fictional world, the color of an element's core is determined by a set of rules:

- If an element has a prime number of protons, its core is silver.

- If the element's atomic number is both prime and a perfect square, the core color is gold.

- If an element's atomic number is an even number that is not a multiple of 4, the core is red.

- If an element's atomic number is odd and not prime, the core is blue.

- If an element's atomic number is a multiple of 3, the core is green.

- If an element's atomic number is a multiple of both 3 and 4, the core is black.

- If none of the above conditions are met, the core's color is unknown.

You are given the atomic number of a mysterious element: 22.

What color is the core of this element? Apply all rules in sequence and only answer with the core's color.

The core color of the element with the atomic number 22 is:

To solve this complex problem, we need to apply the given rules in sequence to the atomic number of the element, which is 22.


1. Check if 22 is a prime number. It is not (22 = 2 * 11).

2. Determine if 22 is a perfect square. It is not (the square roots of the nearest perfect squares, 16 and 25, are not 22).

3. Check if 22 is an even number. It is (22 is divisible by 2).

4. Check if 22 is a multiple of 4. It is not (22 divided by 4 leaves a remainder).

5. Check if 22 is an odd number. It is (22 divided by 2 leaves a remainder).

6. Check if 22 is a prime number. We have already established that it is not.

7. Check if 22 is a multiple of 3. It is (22 divided by 3 leaves a remainder).

8. Check if 22 is a multiple of both 3 and 4. It is not (as established above).


Given that none of the conditions for prime, perfect square, even (excluding multiples of 4), prime, or multiples of 3 (and 4) apply, the core's color of this element is unknown.


The core color of the element with atomic number 22 is:
