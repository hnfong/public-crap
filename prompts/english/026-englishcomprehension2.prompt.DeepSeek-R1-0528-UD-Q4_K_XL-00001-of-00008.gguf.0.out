First, the initial setup: There are 3 black blocks on top of a block of unknown color. Beneath all that, there's a blue block. So, stacking from bottom to top: blue block, then unknown color block, then 3 black blocks on top.

Then, we remove all blocks and shuffle them with one additional green block. So now we have: the original blocks (blue, unknown, and 3 blacks) plus one green block. That's a total of 5 blocks: blue, unknown, black, black, black, and green.

After shuffling, we put them back on top of each other. The new information is that the yellow block is on top of the blue block. But there's no yellow block mentioned before. The blocks are: blue, unknown, three blacks, and green. No yellow. That doesn't make sense.

Perhaps I misread. Let me read the question again.

"there is a blue block" initially. Then we add a green block. But it says "the yellow block is on top of blue block." Yellow? Where did yellow come from?

Maybe the unknown color is yellow? But it says "the yellow block" as if it's specified, but we don't know the color of that one block.

Perhaps "yellow" is a typo or something. Let me read carefully.

" The yellow block is on top of blue block."

But in the initial description, no yellow is mentioned. Only black, unknown, blue, and then we add green.

Unless the unknown color is yellow? But it's not stated; it's unknown.

Perhaps after shuffling, one of the blocks is called yellow, but that doesn't make sense.

Another thought: maybe "yellow" refers to the color of one of the blocks, but we need to figure out what it is.

The question is: "What color is the block we don't know the color of?" and it says "Only answer in one word. Don't explain."

But in the new stack, it says "the yellow block is on top of blue block." So, in the new arrangement, there is a yellow block on top of a blue block.

But from the blocks we have, the colors are: blue, unknown (let's call it X), black, black, black, and green. So possible colors are blue, X, black, green. No yellow mentioned.

Unless X is yellow, but we don't know that yet.

Perhaps after shuffling, the block that was unknown is now called yellow for some reason, but that seems odd.

Maybe "yellow" is a mistake, and it's supposed to be "green" or something. But let's not assume that.

Another idea: perhaps "the yellow block" refers to the block that is on top of blue, and we need to find what color it is, but the question is about the unknown color block from before.

Let's parse the sentence: "The yellow block is on top of blue block."

This is given after the shuffling and restacking.

But in the context, "yellow" might be indicating that the block on top of blue is yellow, meaning that in the new stack, the block directly above blue is yellow.

But what colors do we have? We have blue, X (unknown), three blacks, and green.

So for there to be a yellow block, X must be yellow, or one of the blacks is yellow, but blacks are black, so probably not.

Unless the black blocks are not all black, but the problem says "3 black blocks," so they are black.

Similarly, blue is blue, green is green.

So the only unknown is X, which could be yellow.

But let's see the new stack arrangement.

Initially: bottom is blue, then X, then three blacks on top.

After removal, we have five blocks: blue, X, black1, black2, black3, and green.

We shuffle them, so random order, then stack them.

After stacking, we are told that "the yellow block is on top of blue block."

This means that in the new stack, there is a blue block, and directly on top of it is a yellow block.

But since none of the blocks are yellow except possibly X, it must be that X is yellow, and it happens to be on top of blue in the new stack.

But is that necessarily true? It could be that green or black is on top of blue, but they are not yellow, so if a black is on top of blue, it can't be yellow, so for there to be a yellow block on top of blue, it must be that X is yellow and it is placed on top of blue.

But the position is after shuffling, so it's random, but the fact is given that in this particular instance, yellow is on top of blue.

But for that to be possible, there must be a yellow block, so X must be yellow.

Otherwise, if X is not yellow, there is no yellow block, so "the yellow block" wouldn't exist, but the statement says it is on top of blue, implying it exists.

Therefore, X must be yellow.

Moreover, in the new stack, it is on top of blue, but that doesn't affect the color; it just confirms that yellow exists.

So the unknown color must be yellow.

But let's see if there's more.

Perhaps "the yellow block" is referring to one of the blocks, and we need to identify it.

But the question is specifically about the block we didn't know the color of initially.

Another thought: in the initial setup, we have three black blocks on top of X, and X on blue.

After adding green and shuffling, we restack, and now yellow is on top of blue.

But yellow could be any block except blue, I suppose.

But we need to find X's color.

The key might be that in the initial stack, the three blacks are together on top of X, but after shuffling, they are separated.

But I don't see how that helps.

Perhaps the fact that yellow is on top of blue now, but initially, X was on top of blue, but X might not be yellow.

Let's denote the blocks.

Let B_blue be the blue block.

U be the unknown color block.

B1, B2, B3 be the three black blocks.

G be the green block added.

Initial stack: bottom B_blue, then U, then B1, B2, B3 on top. So order: B_blue, U, B1, B2, B3 from bottom to top.

After removal, we have five blocks: B_blue, U, B1, B2, B3, G.

Shuffle them, so random permutation.

Then stack them in some order, say from bottom to top: P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, where each P is one of the blocks.

Given that "the yellow block is on top of blue block."

This means that for some i, P_i is B_blue, and P_{i+1} is the yellow block.

But what is yellow? It must be one of U, B1, B2, B3, G, but B1,B2,B3 are black, G is green, B_blue is blue, so only U can be yellow, because if U is not yellow, there is no yellow block.

Therefore, U must be yellow.

Moreover, in this stacking, U is on top of B_blue, but that might not be necessary; it just happens to be in this case, but the color is fixed.

The color of U is yellow, regardless of position.

The position is given to confirm or something, but for the existence of yellow, U must be yellow.

Perhaps "yellow" is a name, but I think it's the color.

The problem says "the yellow block" implying a block of yellow color.

Since no other block can be yellow except U, U must be yellow.

Therefore, the unknown color is yellow.

But let's see the answer format: only one word, don't explain.

So probably "yellow".

But is there a trick?

Another interpretation: "the yellow block" might refer to the block that was on top in the initial setup or something, but the problem doesn't say that.

It says "the yellow block is on top of blue block" in the new stack.

Perhaps after shuffling, the block that was beneath the three blacks is now on top of blue or something, but not specified.

I think I'm overcomplicating.

Simple logic: for there to be a yellow block, and the only possible candidate is the unknown color block, so it must be yellow.

Moreover, in the new stack, it is on top of blue, which is consistent but not necessary for the color.

So I think the answer is yellow.

But let's read the question once more to be sure.

"Question:

There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block. We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of blue block.

What color is the block we don't know the color of? Only answer in one word. Don't explain."

Yes, so based on this, the unknown must be yellow.

Perhaps "the yellow block" is the green block or something, but green is added, and it's green, not yellow.

Unless the green is called yellow, but that doesn't make sense.

No, I think it's straightforward.

So the block we don't know the color of is yellow.
