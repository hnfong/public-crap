Okay, here’s a free prompt – let’s explore the concept of “Echoes of the Forgotten.”

**Prompt:**

Imagine you’ve stumbled upon an antique music box in a dusty, forgotten corner of an old library. When you wind it, it doesn’t play a familiar melody. Instead, it emits a faint, layered sound – a ghostly echo of a life lived long ago. As you listen, you begin to experience fragmented memories, not your own, but the memories of someone else – a woman named Elara, who lived in the house centuries ago. 

**Write a story (around 750-1000 words) exploring this experience. Consider these questions as you write:**

*   **What is Elara’s life like?**  What was her occupation, her personality, her joys and sorrows?  Don’t just tell us about her; *show* us through the echoes.
*   **What kind of music box is it?**  Does it have a unique mechanism?  Does it seem to react to your presence?
*   **What are the echoes like?** Are they clear and distinct, or blurry and fragmented? Do they feel like a conversation, a warning, or a longing?
*   **How does the experience affect you?** Do you try to understand Elara’s past? Do you feel a connection to her? Does it change your own perception of the present?
*   **Is there a reason the music box is playing?** Is it a message, a puzzle, or simply a residual echo of a past event? 

**Bonus:**  Introduce a subtle, unsettling element – perhaps a feeling of being watched, a sense of disorientation, or a lingering scent that hints at a forgotten tragedy.
