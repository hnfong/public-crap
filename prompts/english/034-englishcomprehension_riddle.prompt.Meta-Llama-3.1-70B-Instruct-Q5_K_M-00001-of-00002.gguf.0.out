Consider this scenario:

Alice: Are you eating healthy?
Bob: Yes! Today I ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat.
Alice: Wow! Let me see.
Bob: (sends Alice a photo)
Alice: wtf

Question: what happened? What did Bob eat and was it healthy?

A humorous scenario!

It seems that Bob's description of his meal was a creative way of describing a not-so-healthy food. Based on his description, it's likely that Bob ate a pizza.

Here's a breakdown of his description:

* "Aged organic milk" = Mozzarella cheese (which is often aged and can be made from organic milk)
* "Tossed over seasoned tomato purée" = Tomato sauce
* "Spread on baked whole wheat" = Spread on a whole wheat crust (i.e., a whole wheat pizza crust)

So, Bob likely ate a pizza, which may not be considered a particularly healthy food option, despite his creative attempt to make it sound healthy. Alice's reaction ("wtf") suggests that she was surprised and amused by the discrepancy between Bob's description and the actual food. [end of text]
