Once upon a time, in a small village in England, there was a little girl named Lily. Lily loved rainbows more than anything in the world. She would watch them from her bedroom window, mesmerized by their beauty.

One day, while playing in the garden, Lily saw a rainbow that was extra special. It was a double rainbow! She had never seen one before. The colors were so bright and the rainbow was so big that it seemed to touch the sky.

Lily ran to her parents and told them about the rainbow. They were amazed and decided to take a walk to see it. When they arrived, they were both in awe. The double rainbow was even more beautiful than Lily had imagined.

From that day on, Lily would always look for rainbows. She knew that they were a symbol of hope and magic. And every time she saw one, she felt a little bit happier and more hopeful. [end of text]
