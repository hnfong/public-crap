1. The letter "A" is used in the English language spelling of the number 1.

2. The sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is famous for its simplicity and memorable rhythm.

3. Once upon a time, there were three little pigs who decided to build their own houses. The first pig built his house out of straw, the second pig built his house out of sticks, and the third pig built his house out of bricks. One day, a big, bad wolf came along and saw the houses. He decided to eat the pigs for dinner. He went to the first pig's house and said, "Little pig, little pig, let me in!" The first pig said, "Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin!" The wolf said, "Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And he did. The first pig ran to the second pig's house. The wolf followed him and said the same thing. The second pig said, "Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin!" The wolf said, "Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" And he did. The second pig ran to the third pig's house. The wolf followed him and said the same thing. The third pig said, "Not by the hair of my chinny chin chin!" The wolf said, "Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" But he couldn't. The third pig's house was made of bricks and was very strong. The wolf tried to blow it down, but he couldn't. He tried to climb the chimney, but the third pig had a pot of boiling water ready and poured it down the chimney. The wolf ran away, and the three little pigs lived happily ever after. The end.
