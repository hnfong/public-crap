Here are my answers:

1. **One thousand** - You would have to count to 1,000 (one thousand) before using the letter "A" in the English spelling of a whole number. All numbers from zero through 999 are spelled without the letter "A" (zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, sixty, seventy, eighty, ninety, hundred, and combinations thereof).

2. **"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."** This sentence is famous for being a **pangram** - it contains every letter of the English alphabet at least once. It's commonly used for typing practice, font displays, and testing keyboards.

3. **The Three Little Pigs Meet Little Red Riding Hood**

One sunny morning, the three little pigs were playing in the meadow when they heard someone crying. Behind a large oak tree, they found Little Red Riding Hood sitting with her basket, looking very worried.

"What's wrong?" asked the first little pig.

"I was on my way to Grandmother's house," sniffled Little Red Riding Hood, "but I got lost in the woods and now I don't know which path to take."

The second little pig, who was quite clever, studied the basket. "I see you have some delicious cookies for your grandmother. That's very thoughtful!"

"But what if the big bad wolf finds me again?" she worried.

The third little pig, the bravest of all, puffed out his chest. "Don't worry! We know all about wolves. We built our houses strong so they couldn't blow them down."

Together, they decided to walk to Grandmother's house, with the pigs promising to protect Little Red Riding Hood along the way. When they arrived, Grandmother was delighted to see them all, and they shared the cookies and listened to stories about building strong friendships.

From that day forward, Little Red Riding Hood and the three little pigs became the best of friends, always looking out for one another in the forest. [end of text]
