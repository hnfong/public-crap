We are given a scenario with blocks. Let's break down the initial setup:

- There are 3 black blocks on top of a block of unknown color (let's call this block X).
- Beneath the 3 black blocks, there is a blue block.

So the initial stack (from top to bottom) is:
  Top: black, black, black, [X], blue

But note: the problem says "3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block". This means:
  The unknown block (X) is directly under the 3 black blocks, and then below X is the blue block.

Therefore, the stack from top to bottom is:
  black, black, black, X, blue

Now, we remove all blocks and shuffle them with one additional green block. So we have:
  Original blocks: 3 black, 1 unknown (X), 1 blue -> total 5 blocks.
  We add one green block -> total 6 blocks.

Then we put them back on top of each other (in a new stack). The problem states: "The yellow block is on top of blue block."

Wait, note: the problem says "the yellow block". But in our original set, we don't have a yellow block. We have:
  black (3), blue (1), unknown (X), and then we added a green block.

So where did the yellow block come from? This is a critical point.

Let me reread the problem: "We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of blue block."

Wait, the problem says "the yellow block", but we never had a yellow block in the original set. The original set had:
  - 3 black blocks
  - 1 block of unknown color (X)
  - 1 blue block

And then we added one green block. So the blocks we have are:
  black, black, black, X, blue, green.

There is no yellow block. So how can there be a yellow block?

This suggests that the unknown block (X) must be yellow. Because the problem mentions "the yellow block". Therefore, the block we don't know the color of is yellow.

But let's check the problem statement again: "The yellow block is on top of blue block."

So in the new stack, there is a yellow block and it is placed on top of the blue block.

Therefore, the yellow block must be one of the blocks we have. Since we don't have a yellow block in the original set (except possibly the unknown block), the unknown block must be yellow.

Hence, the color of the block we don't know is yellow.

But wait, let's make sure. The problem says "the yellow block", so we must have a yellow block. The only block that could be yellow is the unknown one. So we conclude that X is yellow.

Therefore, the answer is yellow.

However, let's consider if there's any other possibility. The problem says we added a green block, so we have a green block. But the problem mentions a yellow block. So the yellow block must be the unknown one.

Thus, the color of the block we don't know is yellow.

So the answer is: yellow

But note: the problem says "Only answer in one word. Don't explain."

So we output: yellow

Wait, but let me double-check the initial setup. The problem says: "There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block."

So the unknown block is directly under the 3 black blocks and above the blue block. So the stack is:

  black
  black
  black
  [unknown]
  blue

Then we remove all and add a green block. So we have 6 blocks: 3 black, 1 unknown, 1 blue, 1 green.

Now, we form a new stack. The problem states: "The yellow block is on top of blue block."

This implies that in the new stack, there is a yellow block and it is placed immediately above the blue block.

But note: we don't have a yellow block in the set unless the unknown block is yellow. So the unknown block must be yellow.

Therefore, the color of the unknown block is yellow.

Answer: yellow
