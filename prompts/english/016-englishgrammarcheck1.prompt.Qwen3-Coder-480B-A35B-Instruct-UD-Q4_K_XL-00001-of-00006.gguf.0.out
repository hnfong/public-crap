## Grammar Issues

• **Subject-verb agreement error**: "Those who read history knows" should be "Those who read history know"

• **Inconsistent verb tense**: "McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready" should be "McKinsey Pichai was definitely ready" (referring to past event in 2023)

• **Article usage**: "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough" should be "In America we trust they're capitalist enough" (missing lowercase "we" and article "the")

• **Subject-verb agreement**: "interest rates still held 'high'" should be "interest rates are still held 'high'" (missing verb "are")

• **Pronoun disagreement**: "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like" - unclear pronoun reference for "their"

## Serious Stylistic Issues

• **Inconsistent tone shifts**: The text jumps between casual blogging style ("So there's a running story") and more formal analysis without smooth transitions

• **Unclear referent**: "McKinsey Pichai" - this appears to be a conflation/misreference; Pichai is CEO of Google, not McKinsey (the consulting firm)

• **Mixed metaphors**: "product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard" combines crude slang with formal business terminology jarringly

• **Incomplete thought**: "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose" lacks proper punctuation and flows awkwardly from the previous sentence

• **Overly casual phrasing in analytical context**: "the party's gonna end sooner or later" undermines the preceding financial analysis

## Other Problems

• **Factual inconsistency**: References to "McKinsey Pichai" as if McKinsey (consulting firm) and Sundar Pichai (Google CEO) are the same entity

• **Unclear acronym**: "FI" (Financial Independence) is used without explanation in a context where readers might not be familiar with the term

• **Logical gap**: The connection between "levels.fyi" and the broader discussion about tech industry instability is not clearly established

• **Incomplete citation**: "Those who read history knows" references historical patterns without specifying what history or providing examples

• **Vague geographical reference**: "there's actually no tech jobs here" without establishing where "here" refers to, making it confusing for readers [end of text]
