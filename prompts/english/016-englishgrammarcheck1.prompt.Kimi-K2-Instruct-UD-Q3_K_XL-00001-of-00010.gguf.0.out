Grammar / tense / agreement issues
- “might seem to an unwarranted assault” – preposition error: should be “might seem like an unwarranted assault.”  
- “I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs” – tense mismatch: past-tense “had” vs. present-tense “can”; should be “could cut costs.”  
- “Those who read history knows” – subject-verb disagreement: “Those … know” (plural).  
- “I always knew we're in a state of flux” – tense clash: past “knew” vs. present “we're”; should be “we were.”  
- “I would have hated how I participated” – incorrect verb form; should be “I would have hated to have participated” or “I would have hated participating.”  
- “In America We Trust they're capitalist enough” – inconsistent capitalization and missing apostrophe: “In America we trust they’re capitalist enough.”  
- “the free money is draining away” – present continuous with “still” implies ongoing action, but the surrounding narrative is in past tense; revise to “was draining away” or re-cast the sentence.  
- “my technical expertise is… in some funny stack” – present tense “is” clashes with past-tense narrative; should be “was.”  
- “nobody in their right mind uses” – pronoun agreement: “nobody … uses” is singular, but the antecedent “people” earlier is plural; rephrase or adjust pronoun.  
- “the party's gonna end sooner or later” – contraction “party's” is informal and inconsistent with the more formal register elsewhere; also “gonna” is non-standard.  
- “I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something” – contraction “can't” and “he's” are informal; if the rest of the piece avoids contractions, these should be expanded to “cannot” and “he is.”  

Serious stylistic / clarity issues
- Heavy reliance on scare quotes (“real work,” “efficiency,” “True Abundance”) without clarifying the intended irony or skepticism, leaving the tone ambiguous.  
- Sudden shift to first-person trading reflections disrupts the analytical flow and makes the piece read like two separate essays stitched together.  
- Parenthetical “(who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking)” is a long, self-interrupting aside that weakens the argumentative thrust.  
- “McKinsey Pichai” is an unexplained, potentially libellous epithet; readers unfamiliar with the nickname will be confused.  
- The parenthetical “(besides small pockets of AI …)” is a 30-word digression that derails the sentence’s momentum.  
- Overloaded sentence beginning with “With interest rates still held ‘high’ …” runs 60+ words and contains three distinct ideas (rates, promises, efficiency).  
- Colloquialisms (“shitty,” “fun ride,” “gonna”) sit uneasily beside formal diction (“monotonic-increasing,” “paradigm shift”), creating register whiplash.  
- The closing paragraph veers into personal finance disclosure without linking it back to the thesis, leaving the relevance unclear.  
- The phrase “Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance” is capitalized and absolutist, yet undefined; it reads as editorializing rather than analysis.  
- “every industry goes through this phrase” – likely typo for “phase,” which undercuts credibility.  
- The parenthetical “(there's actually no tech jobs here)” contradicts the earlier claim of being “geographically misplaced” and needs clarification. [end of text]
