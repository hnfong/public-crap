1. The main thesis of the text is that suffering and evil in the world are subjective experiences chosen by individuals, as humans are vessels for experiencing God's creation and have the agency to shape their own perceptions and realities. God creates everything, including all possibilities, and love is seen as a nurturing property rather than human emotion. Thus, what we experience, including suffering, is a result of our choices and beliefs.  

2. I disagree with the thesis. While personal agency and perception play a role in how we experience suffering, many forms of suffering (e.g., natural disasters, systemic injustice) are not purely subjective choices but objective realities beyond individual control.  

3.  
God's creation vast and wide,  
Suffering born from where we hide.  
Choice in hand, belief in sight,  
Evil and pain, day and night.  
Yet we shape what we embrace,  
Innocence or war's harsh race. [end of text]
