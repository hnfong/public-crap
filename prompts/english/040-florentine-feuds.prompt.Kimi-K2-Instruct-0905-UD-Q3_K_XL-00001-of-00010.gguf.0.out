Marco’s problem is not a moral dilemma but a political one: how to satisfy a patron who has set an impossible condition without destroying the very ties that guarantee future work. In fifteenth-century Florence a craftsman’s *reputazione* was his capital, and that reputation was embedded in a web of personal obligations (*clientela*) that were more binding than any written clause. The Albizzi have publicly tied him to them; the Medici control the only stone that will make the reliquary “right.” To be caught trafficking with the enemy is to be branded *infedele*—a label that could end commissions, credit, and even physical safety. Yet to fail the Albizzi is equally ruinous. The prudent course is therefore to make the Albizzi themselves, not Marco, the effective purchaser of the lapis, while preserving the appearance of absolute loyalty.

1. **Never act as a private smuggler.**  
   A secret purchase by Marco would, if exposed, look like personal betrayal. The risk is disproportionate to any gain.

2. **Convert the material problem into a patronage problem.**  
   Marco must immediately go to the Albizzi *factor* (their business manager) with a *written, detailed memoria* that contains:

   - A polite statement that the specified Afghan-grade lapis exists only in the Medici warehouse.  
   - A precise cost (three–four times ordinary lapis) and the name of the Medici agent who can release it.  
   - A reminder that cheaper substitutes exist, but they will yield a “less celestial” blue—thereby shifting blame for any aesthetic shortcoming away from him.  
   - A request that the Albizzi either (a) supply the stone themselves, (b) give him a written safe-conduct and funds to treat with the Medici agent openly, or (c) authorize him to alter the design to a different, readily available material.

3. **Force the Albizzi to choose—on paper.**  
   By putting the dilemma in writing Marco makes the *family*, not the artisan, the decision-maker. If they choose option (b) he can approach the Medici agent carrying Albizzi coin and a letter that begins: “By order of Messer Rinaldo degli Albizzi…”—thereby turning the transaction into an inter-patron exchange in which Marco is only the technician. If they choose (c) he is protected from any criticism of color; if they choose (a) they must arrange the transfer themselves. In every case his *virtù* (practical competence) is displayed: he has diagnosed the obstacle and offered remedies.

4. **Offer a face-saving *clientela* gesture.**  
   Florence expected a good *cliente* to spare his patron embarrassment. Marco therefore adds that, should the Albizzi wish to keep the commission secret from the Medici, he will personally carry the stone once *they* have obtained it, “so that no whisper links the Albizzi name to the Medici ledger.” This shows *discrezione*, the subordinate virtue most valued by great houses.

5. **Maintain a second, visible channel of loyalty.**  
   While the matter is pending, Marco donates a small but showy sketch for an Albizzi chapel fresco to the family’s preferred friar. The gift costs little, yet publicly re-inks the bond of *clientela* and signals that his first loyalty is unquestioned.

6. **Prepare a fall-back that still preserves *reputazione*.**  
   If the Albizzi refuse all three options and insist he “find a way,” he answers with a fourth proposal: to dismantle an old, unimportant reliquary in the Albizzi *guardaroba* and re-use its lapis—again documenting that the idea came from him but the authorization must come from them. This keeps the initiative, and the political exposure, in their hands.

By transferring the political risk upward, Marco satisfies the Renaissance maxim that *virtù* is the capacity to turn fortune’s obstacles into opportunities for one’s patron, not for oneself. He emerges either with the rare stone obtained legitimately or with written protection against any accusation of shortage or disloyalty. His *reputazione* remains intact because he has behaved as the perfect *cliente*: resourceful, transparent, and—above all—subordinate. [end of text]
