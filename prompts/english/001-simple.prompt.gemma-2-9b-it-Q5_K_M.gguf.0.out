Here are the answers to your questions:

1. You would have to count to **one thousand** before using the letter "A" in the English spelling of a whole number. 

2. "The quick brown fox **jumps over the lazy dog**." This sentence is famous for containing every letter of the English alphabet at least once.

3.  The three little pigs were enjoying a sunny afternoon in their forest home when a little girl with a bright red hood skipped by.  

"Hello!" chirped Little Red Riding Hood. "Where are you going?"

"We're just relaxing," said Piglet, the youngest, peeking out from behind his straw house. "We built our houses to be safe from the Big Bad Wolf."

Little Red Riding Hood giggled. "A wolf? Don't worry, I'm not afraid of wolves! I'm on my way to Grandma's house."

The pigs exchanged worried glances. They knew the Big Bad Wolf was a real danger.

"Be careful," warned Piglet. "He's very sneaky."

Little Red Riding Hood skipped off, whistling a merry tune. The pigs watched her go, then turned to each other.

"We should warn her," said Piglet. "She might not be as brave as she thinks."

"But she's already gone," sighed Piglet's brother, Porky.

Just then, a low growl echoed through the trees. The pigs froze. The Big Bad Wolf was approaching!

"Quick, hide!" shouted the eldest pig, Percy.

They scurried into their houses, but the wolf was too quick. He huffed and puffed, blowing down Piglet's straw house in a single breath. Piglet ran to his brother's house made of sticks.

The wolf followed, huffing and puffing again, and blew down the stick house too. The two little pigs ran to Percy's sturdy brick house.

The wolf, frustrated, tried to blow down the brick house, but it wouldn't budge. He paced back and forth, growling angrily.

Suddenly, he heard a familiar voice. "Hello, wolf!"

Little Red Riding Hood had returned, carrying a basket of goodies for Grandma. She saw the wolf and stood her ground.

"You're not going to hurt my friends!" she declared bravely.

The wolf, surprised by her courage, hesitated. He had never encountered such a fearless little girl.

Seeing his chance, Percy opened the door and the three little pigs rushed out, chasing the wolf away.

Little Red Riding Hood, relieved, smiled at the pigs. "Thank you for saving me," she said. "I learned a valuable lesson today: never underestimate the power of courage."
