### 1. Main Thesis (3 sentences max):  
The text argues that suffering and evil are subjective experiences chosen by individuals, as God (a nurturing cosmic mechanism) created all possibilities, including how we perceive reality. Our qualia—subjective experiences—shape our world, and we can change our circumstances by altering our choices and beliefs. Thus, suffering is not an inherent flaw in creation but a result of how we choose to experience it.  

### 2. Do you agree? (Concise explanation):  
Partially. While agency and perception play roles in suffering, the text oversimplifies by ignoring systemic, involuntary causes (e.g., poverty, oppression) that aren’t purely "chosen." Not all suffering stems from subjective choice; some is structural or beyond individual control.  

### 3. Short Poem:  
*God’s canvas stretches, infinite and wide,*  
*We paint our worlds with choices inside.*  
*Qualia blooms, a lens we hold,*  
*Suffering’s tale, a story told.*  
*If evil feels, it’s by design,*  
*Change the brush, and realign.*  
*For in the mind, the chains we tie,*  
*Are ours to break, or let them lie.*
