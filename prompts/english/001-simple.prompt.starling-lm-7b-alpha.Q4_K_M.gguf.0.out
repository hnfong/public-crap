The wolf tried to blow the house down, but the pigs' strong brick house stood firm. The wolf then tried to sneak in through the chimney, but Little Red Riding Hood saw him and shouted for the pigs to close the chimney. The wolf, realizing he couldn't get past the pigs, ran away, and the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood continued their adventure, knowing they were safe and protected.
