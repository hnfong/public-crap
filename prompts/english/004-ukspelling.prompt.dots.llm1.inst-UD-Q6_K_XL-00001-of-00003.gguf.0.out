**The Rainbow Over the Park**  

One sunny afternoon, after a quick summer shower, I saw the best rainbow I’ve ever seen. It arched over the park near my house, its colours so bright they looked painted in the sky.  

The rainbow started as a soft pink at the bottom, then turned into a deep orange, like a glowing sunset. Above that was yellow, so bright it made me squint. The green was fresh, like new grass, and the blue was as clear as the sea. At the top, there was a bold purple, almost magical.  

I ran to the park to stand under it. The rainbow seemed close enough to touch, though I knew it wasn’t real—it was just light and rain. Still, it felt special. A group of kids were pointing and laughing, their faces lit up. Even the ducks in the pond seemed to notice, swimming peacefully under its glow.  

As the rain stopped and the sun got brighter, the rainbow faded. But for those few minutes, it made the whole world feel happy. That’s the kind of rainbow I love—simple, bright, and full of wonder.  

Now, whenever it rains, I always look up, hoping to see it again.
