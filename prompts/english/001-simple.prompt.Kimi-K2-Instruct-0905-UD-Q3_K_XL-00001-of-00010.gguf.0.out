1. One thousand – the first whole number whose English spelling contains the letter “A” is 1 000.

2. “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”  
   It is famous for being a pangram: a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet at least once.

3. A short tale of three little pigs and one red-caped girl:

Once upon a time, three brothers—Pig One, Pig Two, and Pig Three—were building their new homes on the edge of the forest.  
While Pig One was still stacking straw, a knock came at the makeshift door. Outside stood a small girl in a crimson hood, a wicker basket on her arm.

“Good morning, messieurs pigs,” she said politely. “I’m off to Grand-mère’s cottage, but I’ve lost my way among these evergreens. Might I ask directions?”

Pig One, who hated maps, shrugged. “Follow the wolf tracks,” he joked, pointing nowhere in particular.  
The girl thanked him and skipped away.

An hour later, a hungry wolf arrived, huffing and puffing.  
“Where’s the bacon?” he snarled.  
Pig One squealed, “The girl in red went that-a-way!”  
The wolf bolted after the easier prey.

At twilight, the pigs heard distant howls, then silence.  
Soon Little Red reappeared, wiping wolf fur from her basket.  
“Your shortcut led me straight to him,” she grinned. “Grand-mère and I had wolf stew for supper. Would you like the recipe?”

The three pigs stared, gulped, and invited her inside the brick house—now reinforced with wolf-proof bolts.  
From that day on, they shared Sunday dinners: the pigs brought the vegetables, Red brought dessert, and the wolf never bothered anyone again. [end of text]
