In this scenario, Bob's response to Alice's question about whether he's eating healthy is intentionally misleading. He describes a complex and seemingly healthy meal, but the photo he sends to Alice likely reveals something entirely different, which is why she responds with "wtf" (an expression of surprise or disbelief).

Bob's description of his meal is a form of humor or sarcasm, where he uses elaborate language to describe something mundane or unhealthy. Without seeing the photo, we can't be certain what Bob actually ate, but it's likely something simple and not as impressive as his description suggests.

As for whether Bob's meal was healthy, it's impossible to say without knowing what he actually ate. However, based on his description, it's clear that he was trying to make his meal sound more healthy and complex than it actually was. [end of text]
