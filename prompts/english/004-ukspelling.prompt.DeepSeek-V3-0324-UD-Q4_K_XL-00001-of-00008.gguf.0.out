**The Best Rainbows**  

After the rain stops and the sun peeks through the clouds, my favourite rainbows appear. Not the faint ones that fade too quickly, but the bright, bold ones that stretch across the sky like a giant smile.  

The best rainbows have all seven colours—red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet—shining clearly. Sometimes, if you’re lucky, you might even see a double rainbow, with a second, softer one glowing above the first.  

I love rainbows after summer showers when the air smells fresh and the grass sparkles with raindrops. They remind me that even after a storm, something beautiful can appear.  

Once, I saw a rainbow end right in our garden! Of course, I didn’t find a pot of gold—just muddy wellies and a very confused cat—but it still felt magical.  

Rainbows don’t last long, so I always make a wish when I see one. Maybe next time, my wish will come true!
