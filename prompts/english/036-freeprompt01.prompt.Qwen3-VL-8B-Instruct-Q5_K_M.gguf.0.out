**The Silent Symphony of Rain on an Old Roof**

It’s not thunder that makes me pause — though the sky may rumble like a distant drum. It’s the rain. The quiet, persistent rain that taps, taps, taps against the slanted tiles of an old roof, each drop a tiny percussionist in a solo performance. The roof, weathered and wise, holds the rhythm — not with force, but with patience. 

I stand beneath the eaves, watching the water trace its path: down the gutters, over the mossy edges, pooling in the hollows where time has left its fingerprints. The tiles, once bright, now hold the patina of decades — gray with memory, softened by the kiss of countless seasons. 

There’s something sacred in this moment. No phone. No rush. No agenda. Just the sound of water and the sigh of the wind through the eaves. The rain doesn’t ask permission to fall. It doesn’t care if anyone is listening. It simply is — a liquid poem written in silver on the sky’s canvas.

I think of the people who lived here before me — their laughter echoing in the halls, their footsteps on the stairs, their quiet moments of reflection beneath the same roof. The rain remembers them. It remembers the warmth of their hands, the scent of their tea, the way they’d lean against the windowpane, watching the clouds drift like forgotten dreams.

And now? Now I’m here, a stranger to the house, a guest to the sky. I don’t own the roof. I don’t own the rain. But I own this moment — this quiet, sacred pause between the world and the weather.

The rain keeps falling. The roof keeps listening. And I? I keep standing — not to watch, but to be watched. To be part of the symphony, even if I’m just a quiet note in the chorus.

Because sometimes, the most beautiful things in life aren’t loud. They’re soft. They’re slow. They’re silent — and they speak louder than any voice ever could.
