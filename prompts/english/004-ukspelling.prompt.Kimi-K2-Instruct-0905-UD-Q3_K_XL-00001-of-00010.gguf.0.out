My best rainbow is the one that pops up after a summer shower on the way home from school.  
We dash out still damp, mums yelling, “Coats!” but we don’t care.  
The sun comes out like a switched-on torch and the colours bend over the chip shop roof: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet—like a giant felt-tip arc.  
We count the stripes, shout which is our favourite (mine’s green, Jess says purple), and stare till our eyes go fuzzy.  
Then it fades, but the smell of chips and warm pavements stays. [end of text]
