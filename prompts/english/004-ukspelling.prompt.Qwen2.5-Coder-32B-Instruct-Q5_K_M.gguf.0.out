In the heart of the UK, where the skies often turn grey, there's a special place I love to visit. It's a small park near my home, with tall trees and a gentle stream. My favourite time there is after a storm, when the rainbows appear.

The rainbows I like best are the ones that stretch across the sky like a bridge made of light. They're not just one, but many, each one a little different. The main one is a bright, bold rainbow with all the colours you can think ofâ€”red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. But sometimes, there's a smaller, fainter rainbow above it, called a secondary rainbow. It's like a secret, hidden treasure in the sky.

These rainbows make me feel happy and hopeful. They remind me that even after the rain, there's always a beautiful surprise waiting. [end of text]
