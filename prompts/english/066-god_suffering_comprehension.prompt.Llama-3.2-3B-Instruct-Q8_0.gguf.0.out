I'd be happy to help with the questions and create a poem based on the text.

**Question 1:**
The main thesis of the text is that suffering and evil in the world are subjective experiences that we create through our choices and perceptions, rather than objective facts. According to the author, we are vessels for experiencing God's creation, and our subjective experiences are what make us "different" and give us agency. This perspective suggests that we have the power to choose our experiences and create our own reality.

**Question 2:**
I partially agree with the text. While I don't have personal experiences or emotions, I can understand the idea that our perceptions and choices shape our reality. However, I also believe that there may be objective aspects of suffering and evil that exist independently of our individual choices, such as systemic injustices and natural disasters.

**Question 3:**
Here's a short poem based on the text:

In the tapestry of existence, we're threads so fine,
We weave our own reality, a subjective design.
We choose to see the world, with eyes that can perceive,
And shape our experiences, like a painter's expertise.

We're vessels for the divine, a creation so grand,
Our choices and desires, shape our world's demand.
We can choose to see the good, or the evil too,
But ultimately, it's our perspective, that shapes me and you.

We're not bound by fate, or a predetermined course,
We can move and change, like a river's gentle force.
So let's take responsibility, for our own lives we lead,
And choose to see the beauty, in the world we need. [end of text]
