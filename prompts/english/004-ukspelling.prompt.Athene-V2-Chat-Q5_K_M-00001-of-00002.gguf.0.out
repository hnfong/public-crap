In the small village of Willowbrook, after the rain, the sky painted its most magical picture. The rainbow I loved the most wasn’t the biggest or the brightest, but the one that appeared softly, like a whisper of colour.

It was a gentle arc, with soft edges that blended into the sky. The red was as warm as a sunset, the orange like a juicy tangerine, the yellow as bright as a daisy, the green as fresh as the grass, the blue as deep as the village pond, and the purple as dreamy as the night sky.

This rainbow didn’t just hang in the sky; it seemed to touch the ground, right by the old oak tree at the edge of the meadow. It was a secret path, leading to a world of wonder. I imagined fairies dancing under its colours and tiny raindrops still clinging to its edges, sparkling like tiny jewels.

Every time I saw it, I felt a smile spread across my face, as if the rainbow was sharing a special secret just with me. It was a reminder that even after the rain, something beautiful always follows. [end of text]
