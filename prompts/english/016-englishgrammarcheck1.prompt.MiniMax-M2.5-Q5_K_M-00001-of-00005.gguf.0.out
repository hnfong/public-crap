Here are the grammar mistakes (especially tense and agreement issues), serious stylistic issues, and other problems I found:

**Grammar / Agreement / Tense Issues:**

1. "a running story" → should be "a running story**s**" (the word "story" is singular but refers to multiple statements/narratives; or use "narrative" instead)
2. "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something" → grammatically fine, but the tense shifts awkwardly from present ("he's probably onto something") to past ("back when tech stocks were down")
3. "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic" → "on the same line of logic" is awkward; "along the same lines of reasoning" is better
4. "it seems their monopolies are still functional" → needs "that" for formal agreement: "it seems **that** their monopolies..."
5. "they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies" → "squeeze quite a bit of profit" is idiomatically awkward; "squeeze quite a bit **of profit out of** their monopolies" or "extract significant profit" is better
6. "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs" → "their" is ambiguous (refers to GOOG/META but "their" is plural, which is fine, but the parenthetical "(GOOG mainly)" creates confusion)
7. "McKinsey Pichai" → this is a serious error: "McKinsey" is a consulting firm, not a title; should be "CEO Pichai" or "Pichai (the CEO)"
8. "I didn't make any trades" → "any trades" is fine, but "any" with plural countable nouns is sometimes considered informal; "any" is acceptable here
9. "I would have hated how I participated" → should be "how I **participated**" (past participle, not base form) or "that I participated"
10. "In America We Trust" → capitalization error; should be "In America **w**e trust" (lowercase "we")
11. "the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole)" → "as a whole" is fine, but the parenthetical is awkward; better: "for investors as a whole"
12. "Those who read history knows" → subject-verb agreement error: "Those who read history **know**" (plural)
13. "Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance" → "True Abundance" is capitalized as if it's a proper noun; should be "true abundance"
14. "people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise" → "by referencing... or otherwise" is grammatically clunky; "by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise" is unclear (otherwise what?)
15. "the party's gonna end" → "gonna" is informal; should be "is going to"
16. "People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like" → missing "that": "have a reasonable expectation **of what** their careers..."
17. "and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing" → "salary" should be "salaries" (plural to match "their careers") or "a salary"
18. "there's actually no tech jobs here" → subject-verb agreement: "there **are** actually no tech jobs here" (or "there is actually no tech industry here")
19. "we're still sane though" → "we're" refers to "my technical expertise" which is singular; should be "it's still sane though" or rephrase

**Serious Stylistic / Logical Issues:**

1. The phrase "running story" is unclear; likely means "ongoing narrative" or "current narrative"
2. "McKinsey Pichai" is a significant error that shows confusion between a company name and a person's title
3. The argument jumps abruptly from discussing personal investment decisions to broader economic commentary without clear transitions
4. "In America We Trust" is a sarcastic reference to "In God We Trust" but is presented as a serious statement, which is confusing
5. The claim "every industry goes through this phrase" — "phrase" should be "phase," showing a word choice error that changes meaning
6. The text mixes first-person reflection, economic analysis, and philosophical commentary without clear organization
7. "the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over" — "taking over" from what? The transition from "free money" to "ruthless capitalist engine" is abrupt and unclear
8. The final paragraph shifts tone dramatically from economic analysis to personal financial anxiety, feeling disconnected from the earlier argument
9. "product enshittification" — this is a real term but used here without explanation, assuming reader familiarity
10. The parenthetical asides (like "(as a whole)") interrupt the flow and make the text harder to follow
11. The phrase "there's actually no tech jobs here" contradicts the earlier claim about working in "some funny stack" — if there are no tech jobs, how does the author have a tech job?
12. The conclusion "Saving up for 'FI' isn't an aspiration — it's a survival necessity" is a significant claim that isn't fully supported by the preceding argument about tech industry volatility
