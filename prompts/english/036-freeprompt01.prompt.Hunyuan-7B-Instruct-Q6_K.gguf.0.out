Imagine you are standing at the edge of a vast, endless desert. The sun blazes overhead, casting long shadows across the dunes. In the distance, you see a shimmering oasis, its waters sparkling like diamonds under the heat. As you approach, you notice strange, glowing creatures scurrying across the sand. They are unlike anything you’ve ever seen—small, insect-like beings with translucent bodies that pulse with an otherworldly light. 

Suddenly, a low, resonant hum begins to fill your ears. The creatures stop moving, their glowing forms flickering as if in fear. You instinctively turn toward the source of the sound, but it seems to come from nowhere and nowhere at once. The desert around you begins to ripple, the sand shifting and forming patterns that resemble ancient, forgotten maps. 

As you step into the oasis, you are greeted by a scene that defies logic. The sky is a swirling canvas of colors, and the ground beneath your feet is made of living, shifting stones that seem to breathe. In the center of the oasis stands a massive, ancient tree with roots that stretch deep into the earth. Its bark is covered in glowing runes, and its branches are adorned with orbs that pulse with energy. 

A voice, both ancient and modern, speaks directly into your mind. It is not a person but a collective of memories and knowledge, a guardian of the universe. The voice explains that the desert and the oasis are part of a larger, interconnected web of reality. The creatures you saw are not just animals—they are the essence of the universe, scattered across different dimensions. 

The voice offers you a choice: you can leave the oasis and return to your world, carrying with you the knowledge and experiences you’ve gained. Or, you can stay and become one with the essence of the universe, merging your body with the tree and its energy. 

What will you choose?
