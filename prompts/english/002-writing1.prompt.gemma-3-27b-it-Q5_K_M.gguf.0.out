## The Stone Collector

Old Man Tiber lived in a cottage built into the side of a hill, a place perpetually shadowed even on the brightest days. He wasn’t known for warmth, or smiles, or much of anything besides his stones. Tiber collected them. Smooth river stones, jagged granite, glittering quartz – his cottage overflowed with them, stacked in precarious towers, lining the windowsills, even filling the space under his worn, patchwork **pillow**.

The children of the village whispered he’d once *been* warm. They said he’d had a wife, Elara, who’d loved to garden and bake bread that smelled like sunshine. But Elara was gone now, taken by a winter fever decades ago, and with her, it seemed, went all the light from Tiber’s world. He’d retreated into his stones, claiming they were steadfast, unchanging, unlike people.

Little Lyra, however, wasn’t afraid of whispers. She was a whirlwind of bright curiosity, and she noticed Tiber always looked…lonely. One day, she decided to do something about it. She baked him a small loaf of her grandmother’s honey bread, the same kind Elara used to make, according to the stories.

When she offered it to him, Tiber barely glanced up from arranging a particularly grey piece of slate. “What’s this?” he grumbled.

“Bread,” Lyra said, holding it out. “My grandma said Elara used to make bread just like it. It smells like a **cloud** of happiness.”

Tiber scoffed. “You’re **exaggerating**, child. Bread is bread.” He took it reluctantly, his fingers rough against the warm crust. He didn’t eat it. He just held it, turning it over and over.

Lyra didn’t give up. She started visiting him every day, not with gifts, but with stories. She told him about her school, her mischievous cat, the silly things her little brother did. She talked *to* him, not *at* him, and slowly, very slowly, Tiber began to listen.

He still didn’t smile, but he stopped grumbling quite so much. He’d occasionally offer a gruff “Hmmph” in response to her stories. One day, Lyra told him about a robin building a nest outside her window. 

“It’s so careful,” she said, “choosing each twig, lining it with soft things. It’s building a home, a place for love.”

Tiber was silent for a long moment. He looked at the bread, still sitting untouched on a shelf amongst the stones. Then, he picked up a smooth, heart-shaped stone, one he’d kept hidden away for years. 

“Elara loved these,” he said, his voice raspy with disuse. “She said they reminded her of…of holding my hand.” He paused, a flicker of something akin to pain crossing his face.

Lyra sat beside him, not saying anything. She understood, without needing words, that the stones weren’t about steadfastness, they were about *remembering*. They were a way to hold onto the love he’d lost.

“I thought if I collected enough,” he continued, his voice barely a whisper, “if I surrounded myself with things that wouldn’t leave, I wouldn’t feel this…emptiness.”

Lyra gently took his hand, her small fingers wrapping around his calloused ones. “But things that don’t leave don’t give you warmth, do they? It’s the things that *do* leave, the people you love, that make life bright. It’s the remembering, and the loving while they’re here, that matters.”

Tiber finally looked at Lyra, really looked at her. He saw the kindness in her eyes, the genuine concern. He saw a reflection of the warmth he’d thought he’d lost forever. 

He finally took a bite of the bread. It wasn’t just bread. It was a connection to the past, a symbol of the love that still lingered, and a promise of a new kind of warmth, born not from possession, but from connection. He realized then that love wasn't about avoiding loss, it was about cherishing the moments *because* of its fleeting nature.  And in that moment, surrounded by his stones, he felt a little less like a shadow, and a little more like a man who remembered how to love.
