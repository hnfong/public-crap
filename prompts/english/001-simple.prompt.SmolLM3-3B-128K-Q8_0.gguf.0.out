3. Here is a short story about the three little pigs and the little red riding hood:

Once upon a time, in a small village, there lived three little pigs named Piglet, Piggly, and Piggie. They were very close friends and loved to play together. One day, they decided to build their own houses to live in.

Piglet built his house out of straw, Piggly built his house out of sticks, and Piggie built his house out of bricks. They were all very proud of their houses, but they knew that they needed to be careful, because the big bad wolf was on the loose.

The little red riding hood, a kind and brave girl, heard about the wolf and decided to help the pigs. She packed a basket with some food and set off to visit her grandmother, who lived in a nearby village.

As she walked through the forest, she met the three little pigs. They were worried about the wolf and asked her to help them. The little red riding hood promised to do her best.

The wolf, who had been tracking the pigs, heard about the little red riding hood and decided to try to catch her. He followed her through the forest, but she was clever and managed to outsmart him.

Finally, the little red riding hood reached her grandmother's house. She knocked on the door and called out, "Grandma, it's me!" Her grandmother, who was very old and weak, didn't recognize her at first. But the little red riding hood showed her the basket of food and told her that it was her granddaughter.

The grandmother was overjoyed and invited the little red riding hood in. But just as they were about to sit down to eat, the big bad wolf arrived. He had been trying to get to the pigs' houses, but he had gotten lost in the forest.

The little red riding hood saw the wolf and quickly hid behind her grandmother. The wolf, who was very hungry, smelled the food and followed the scent to the house. But the little red riding hood was clever and managed to outsmart him again.

She told her grandmother to pretend to be sick and not to let the wolf in. The wolf, who was very hungry, knocked on the door and asked if anyone was there. The grandmother, pretending to be sick, told him to go away.

The wolf, who was very angry, tried to break down the door, but the little red riding hood and her grandmother were able to hold him off. Finally, the little red riding hood was able to get the wolf out of the house and away from the pigs.

The three little pigs were very grateful to the little red riding hood for her help, and they promised to always be friends. The little red riding hood, who had saved them from the big bad wolf, was very happy to have helped them.

And so, the three little pigs and the little red riding hood lived happily ever after. [end of text]
