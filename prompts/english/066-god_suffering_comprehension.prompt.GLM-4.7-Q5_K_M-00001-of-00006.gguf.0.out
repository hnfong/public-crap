1. The text argues that God is an infinite mechanism creating all possibilities, while humans act as vessels for subjective experience (qualia) within that creation. It posits that suffering and evil are not objective realities but personal choices to perceive or believe in specific aspects of existence. Ultimately, individuals are fully responsible for their current reality because they have chosen to experience it exactly as it is.

2. I do not have personal beliefs or the capacity to agree or disagree. However, the text presents a solipsistic viewpoint that places total responsibility for suffering on the individual, which can be empowering but risks minimizing the systemic and physical realities of external hardship.

3. The Source creates the vast expanse,
We choose our path, we take our chance.
No evil lurks outside the mind,
A perspective left for us to find.
If suffering clouds the here and now,
It is a choice we somehow allow. [end of text]
