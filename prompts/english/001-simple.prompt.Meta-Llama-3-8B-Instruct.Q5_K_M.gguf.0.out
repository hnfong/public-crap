I'd be happy to help you with those questions!

1. The answer is 10. The first time the letter "A" appears in the English language spelling of a whole number is in the number 10.

2. The sentence is: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." This sentence is famous for being a pangram, which means it uses all the letters of the alphabet at least once. It's often used as a demonstration of a font or keyboard's capabilities.

3. Here's a short story about the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood:

Once upon a time, the three little pigs were busy building their new homes. The first little pig was building his house out of straw, the second little pig was building his house out of sticks, and the third little pig was building his house out of bricks.

As they worked, they noticed a little girl in a red hood walking by. She was on her way to visit her grandmother who lived on the other side of the forest.

The three little pigs were curious and decided to introduce themselves. They invited Little Red Riding Hood to join them for a snack and some company.

As they sat down to eat, the big bad wolf appeared at the door. He had been watching the three little pigs and was looking for an easy meal. But the three little pigs were prepared. They had built their houses to withstand the wolf's attacks, and they were ready to defend themselves.

The wolf tried to huff and puff, but the first little pig's straw house was no match for him. The wolf blew it down, and the first little pig ran to the second little pig's stick house.

The wolf tried again, and the second little pig's stick house also fell down. The two little pigs ran to the third little pig's brick house.

The wolf was getting tired, but he was determined to eat one of the little pigs. He huffed and puffed with all his might, but the third little pig's brick house was too strong. The wolf couldn't blow it down.

Just then, Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother appeared at the door. They had been watching the whole scene from a distance and had come to help the three little pigs.

Together, the four of them chased the big bad wolf away and lived happily ever after. [end of text]
