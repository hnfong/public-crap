Sure, here are the identified issues in the text:

### Grammar Mistakes (especially tense and "agreement" issues)

1. **Tense Inconsistency**: The text switches between present and past tense without clear reason. For example, "So there's a running story" (present) and "back when tech stocks were down last year" (past).
2. **Subject-Verb Agreement**: "There's a running story" should be "There is a running story" for proper subject-verb agreement.
3. **Pronoun Reference**: "McKinsey Pichai" should be "Sundar Pichai" for clarity and correctness.
4. **Tense Consistency**: "In the end I didn't make any trades" should be "In the end, I didn't make any trades" for proper punctuation and clarity.
5. **Parallel Structure**: "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." should be "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, Sundar Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." for clarity and correctness.

### Serious Stylistic Issues

1. **Wordiness**: The text is overly verbose in some sections. For example, "In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG." could be simplified.
2. **Repetition**: The phrase "GOOG" is repeated multiple times without clear necessity. For example, "META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG)" could be simplified to "META and GOOG (particularly GOOG)".
3. **Informal Tone**: The text uses an informal tone that may not be suitable for all audiences. For example, "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose." could be rephrased for a more formal tone.
4. **Lack of Clarity**: Some sentences are unclear or ambiguous. For example, "Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another." should be "Those who read history know -- every industry goes through this phase in some form or another."
5. **Inconsistent Capitalization**: The text inconsistently capitalizes proper nouns and titles. For example, "McKinsey Pichai" should be "Sundar Pichai" for correctness.

### Other Problems

1. **Lack of Citation**: The text references specific companies and individuals without proper citation or context, which could be seen as problematic.
2. **Assumptions**: The text makes assumptions about the work ethic of tech workers and the motivations of company executives without providing evidence.
3. **Predictions**: The text makes predictions about the future of tech companies and the job market without clear basis or evidence.
4. **Bias**: The text exhibits a strong bias against certain aspects of capitalism and tech companies, which could be seen as problematic.
5. **Lack of Conclusion**: The text does not provide a clear conclusion or summary of its main points, leaving the reader without a clear takeaway.

These issues should be addressed to improve the clarity, coherence, and professionalism of the text. [end of text]
