The rainbows I like most are the ones after a summer storm. The sky is still a bit grey, but the sun peeks through. Then, a bright arc of colour appears. It looks like a bridge made of light.

I like the way the colours are soft and clear. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. They sit in the sky like a friendly smile. The air feels fresh and clean. The world looks new.

Sometimes, if I am lucky, I see a double rainbow. Two arcs, one faint, one bright. It feels like a secret gift. I stand still and watch. I feel calm and happy. Rainbows remind me that after the rain, something beautiful can happen. They are simple, bright, and full of hope. [end of text]
