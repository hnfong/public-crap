Okay, here's a story about me, Alex, and my secret life as a wood elf.

My name is Alex, and I go to Kowloon Technical Secondary School. It’s a big school, lots of people, lots of noise, lots of rules. Sometimes it feels like I’m just trying to blend in, like I’m made of the same grey concrete as the buildings around us. But I’m not. Not really.

My real name is Alaric, and I’m a wood elf. My family isn’t from Hong Kong originally. We came here years ago, my parents trying to find a place where we could live without… well, without people knowing. My dad works in a small office, my mom teaches English. They’re good at hiding, just like I try to be.

Being a wood elf isn’t something I can just switch off. It’s in my blood, in my bones. I can hear things other people can’t – the tiny rustle of leaves miles away, the faint hum of insects under the city noise. My senses are sharper. I can move quieter than anyone I know, which is sometimes useful when Mr. Chan isn’t looking and I need to borrow a pencil without him noticing.

The worst part is PE. Running laps around the concrete track feels like torture. My feet ache for soft earth, for the feel of moss under my soles. The smell of sweat and chlorine in the changing rooms makes me want to gag. Sometimes, during stretching, I catch the scent of rain on distant trees, a scent only I seem to notice, and it makes me miss the woods so much it hurts.

My best friend is Benny. He’s a good guy, doesn’t ask too many questions. We sit together in most classes. Sometimes, when the teacher is explaining something complicated, I get distracted. I see the pattern of light filtering through the window blinds, and for a second, it looks like sunlight dappled through ancient forest canopy. I feel a pull, a longing to be somewhere green, somewhere quiet.

After school is the hardest time. Everyone heads home or hangs out at the mall. I used to love the mall, but now the bright lights and the crowds feel suffocating. Instead, I find excuses to go to the city park. It’s not a real forest, not like the ones back home, but it’s the closest thing here.

Yesterday, I was walking home from school, trying to ignore the honking cars and the rush hour crowd. I saw a little bird, a sparrow, trapped in a net someone had carelessly left hanging from a tree branch. It was fluttering frantically, making little distressed chirps. Most people just walked past, maybe gave it a quick, pitying glance. But I couldn’t.

My fingers, usually clumsy with pens and calculators, moved with surprising speed and sureness. I reached up, my movements silent, and carefully untangled the netting from the branch. The bird looked at me, its little chest heaving, then hopped down and flew away, a small, swift shadow against the grey sky.

That’s the thing about being a wood elf. I can’t just ignore the small things. I feel connected to them, responsible for them. It’s a burden sometimes, this secret life, this constant awareness of a world hidden just beneath the surface of the one everyone else sees.

I wish sometimes I could just be normal. Go to the movies, worry about exams like everyone else, without this constant undercurrent of something else inside me. But I can’t. I’m Alaric, the wood elf, stuck in a city of concrete and noise, trying my best to be just Alex, the quiet student from Kowloon Technical. And for now, that’s enough. I just have to keep my secrets safe, and maybe, one day, find a way to be both. [end of text]
