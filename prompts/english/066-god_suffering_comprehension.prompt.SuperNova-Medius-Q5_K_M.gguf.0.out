1. The main thesis of the text is that we are vessels for experiencing God's creation, and our subjective experiences are a result of our choices. We create our own experiences by choosing what and how to experience it, and even the perception of suffering and evil is a personal choice.

2. I agree with the idea that our subjective experiences are a result of our choices, as it emphasizes personal responsibility and agency. However, I find the notion that suffering and evil are merely personal choices to be somewhat dismissive of the real-world consequences of these issues.

3. In the realm of our minds, we choose our fate,
Our experiences shaped by the paths we create.
Suffering and evil, some say, are real,
But in truth, they're just choices we feel.

We are vessels, experiencing all,
Our choices shaping our subjective call.
So let us choose wisely, with care and with thought,
For our choices will shape our world, both inside and out.
