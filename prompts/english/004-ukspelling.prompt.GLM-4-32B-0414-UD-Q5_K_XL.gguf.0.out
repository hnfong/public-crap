The rainbows I like the most are the ones that appear after a summer shower. They are bright and clear, with all the colours shining like a proper rainbow should.

I love how they stretch across the sky, sometimes touching the clouds. They look like a bridge made of colours, connecting one side of the world to the other.

The best bit is when you see a double rainbow. It’s like getting a bonus! The colours are a bit fainter, but it’s still amazing to see.

I always stop and look. It makes me feel happy, like the world is showing off its prettiest colours just for me. They don’t last long, but while they’re there, they make the whole day brighter. [end of text]
