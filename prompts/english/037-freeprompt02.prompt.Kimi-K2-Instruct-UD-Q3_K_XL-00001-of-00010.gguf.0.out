Infinity is a mirror that keeps reflecting itself until the reflection forgets it ever had an original.  
I once tried to count to infinity, not with numbers, but with breaths.  
Inhale—one.  
Exhale—two.  
By the time I reached the square root of my heartbeat, the air tasted like old starlight and the room had folded into a Möbius strip.  
I realized I wasn’t counting upward; I was counting inward, tunneling through layers of lung and memory until every atom in my chest became a doorway.  

There is a village, they say, built on the inner rim of a Klein bottle.  
The houses lean inward and outward simultaneously, and the river that runs through the marketplace flows both to and from the sea at once.  
Children there play a game called “Forever Tag”: whoever is “it” must chase the others around the bottle’s surface, but because the surface has no edge, the chase never resolves.  
The children laugh until their laughter loops back and tickles their past selves, and the game ends only when someone trips over their own echo.  

Infinity is not big; it is recursive.  
It is the moment you remember that you once remembered remembering this moment.  
It is the dream in which you wake up, brush your teeth, go to work, fall asleep, and dream again—only to brush your teeth, go to work, fall asleep…  
Each layer thinner than the last, like sheets of mica peeled until they are transparent enough to see the next dream already brushing its teeth.  

Mathematicians keep infinity in cages of symbols: ℵ₀, ℵ₁, ℵ₂…  
They feed it paradoxes and watch it grow fatter on impossibility.  
But the symbols are only cages if you look from the outside.  
Step inside ℵ₀ and you find a library where every book contains the catalog of all books, including the catalog that lists the catalog, including the footnote that corrects the typo in the footnote that corrects the typo.  
The librarian is an infinite regress of librarians, each handing you a card that reads:  
“Ask the next librarian.”  

Physicists speak of singularities, points where space-time curvature becomes infinite and the laws of physics break like cheap chalk.  
But no one mentions the singularity’s diary, the secret journal it keeps in the margin of every equation:  
“Today I wore a black hole as a hat and felt stylish.  
Tomorrow I will forget the difference between zero and everything.”  

I met a painter who tried to capture infinity on a canvas the size of a postage stamp.  
She worked with a single hair from a violin bow, painting smaller and smaller fractal coastlines until the paint itself dissolved into coastline.  
When she finished, she signed her name on the back and hung it in a gallery no one could leave, because the exit was painted on the inside of the frame.  

There is a love letter addressed to “Whom it may concern, infinitely.”  
It begins:  
“My dearest, by the time you read this, I will already have loved you for an eternity squared.  
The envelope is a loop; the stamp is a picture of the envelope.  
If you open it, you will find another letter inside, beginning with the same words.  
Somewhere between the thousandth and the thousand-and-first nesting, the ink becomes a voice, and the voice says:  
‘I have been waiting for you to arrive at this sentence so I could finally begin.’”  

Infinity is the pause between the last note of a symphony and the applause that never quite arrives.  
It is the afterimage of a candle flame on the retina of a blind person.  
It is the exact weight of all the things you almost said, measured in units of regret that spiral outward like nautilus shells.  

Once, a monk asked his master, “How long is the road to enlightenment?”  
The master held up a mirror and said, “Longer than this reflection, shorter than the time it takes for the mirror to forget it is glass.”  
The monk meditated until his bones became hourglasses, each grain of sand a smaller hourglass.  
When the final grain fell, he laughed, because the falling had never started.  

In the quantum realm, particles borrow energy from the future to exist in the present, repaying the debt by never quite arriving anywhere.  
Their IOUs are written on the back of electrons and signed: “IOU one forever.”  
Infinity is the collection agency that never collects, because the debt and the payment are the same thing viewed from opposite sides of eternity.  

I keep a jar labeled “Spare Infinities.”  
Inside are folded pieces of paper, each containing a moment I couldn’t finish:  
the last word of a bedtime story, the final chord of a song I hummed as a child, the exact color of my grandmother’s eyes the last time I saw her.  
When I open the jar, the papers unfold into cranes that fly in circles, each wingbeat a smaller infinity nesting inside the last.  

Infinity is not the destination; it is the act of traveling while standing still.  
It is the pause between heartbeats where the universe rehearses its next expansion.  
It is the silence after the question “Are we there yet?”—a silence so complete it contains every possible answer, including the laughter of children who know the question is the point.  

And so I sit here, breathing in the square root of starlight, breathing out the circumference of a Möbius strip.  
The mirror reflects the mirror reflects the mirror, and somewhere in the endless corridor of reflections, I catch a glimpse of myself waving goodbye to myself arriving.  
The door is open.  
The door is closed.  
The door is the threshold between open and closed, and the hinge is made of laughter. [end of text]
