Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. So the question is about determining the color of a block we don't know the color of. Let me parse the information given.

First part: There are 3 black blocks on top of an unknown color block, and beneath them there's a blue block. So let me visualize this. So we have a structure where there's a block with 3 black blocks on top of it, and beneath those 3 black blocks is a blue block. So the order from bottom to top would be blue block, then 3 black blocks? Or maybe the other way around? Wait no, let me think.

Wait the question says: "There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block." So perhaps it's arranged as: blue block is beneath the block we don't know color. So the structure is: beneath the unknown color block is a blue block, and above that blue block are 3 black blocks. So the order from bottom to top would be blue block, then 3 black blocks on top of it? Or maybe the unknown color block has 3 black blocks on top of it, and beneath those 3 black blocks is a blue block. So perhaps the structure is:

Unknown color block has 3 black blocks on top, and beneath those 3 black blocks is a blue block. So the order from bottom to top would be blue block, then 3 black blocks, then the unknown color block? Or maybe the unknown color block is below the blue block? Wait, let me clarify.

The first part: "There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block." So perhaps:

- The block we don't know color has 3 black blocks on top of it. So the structure is: 3 black blocks on top of it. Then beneath those 3 black blocks is a blue block. So the order from bottom to top would be blue block, then 3 black blocks on top of the unknown color block. So the unknown color block is at the bottom? Or is the unknown color block above the blue block?

Wait no: "There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block." So perhaps:

The block we don't know color has 3 black blocks on top of it. So the structure is: unknown color block has 3 black blocks on top of it. So the order from bottom to top would be 3 black blocks, then the unknown color block? But then beneath them is a blue block. So perhaps the blue block is beneath the 3 black blocks? So the arrangement is blue block is below the 3 black blocks, which are on top of the unknown color block. So the order from bottom to top is blue block, then 3 black blocks, then the unknown color block.

So the unknown color block is at the top? Or is it somewhere in between?

Wait the question says: "We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of blue block."

Wait perhaps I need to parse this step by step.

Let me try to outline the initial setup:

First scenario:

- There are blocks arranged as follows:

Top: unknown color block

Below it: 3 black blocks

Beneath those 3 black blocks: a blue block

So the order from top to bottom would be:

Unknown color block

Then 3 black blocks

Then blue block.

So the structure is:

Unknown color block is on top,

then 3 black blocks,

then beneath them is a blue block.

So total blocks: 1 (unknown) + 3 black + 1 blue = 5 blocks?

Then the question says: "We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of blue block."

Wait perhaps I need to parse this correctly.

So initial setup:

- 3 black blocks on top of an unknown color block, and beneath them is a blue block.

So perhaps:

The structure is:

Blue block is beneath the 3 black blocks, which are on top of the unknown color block.

So:

Unknown color block is at the bottom?

No, perhaps:

The unknown color block has 3 black blocks on top of it, and beneath those 3 black blocks is a blue block. So the arrangement is:

Blue block is beneath the 3 black blocks, which are on top of the unknown color block.

So from bottom to top: Blue block, then 3 black blocks, then unknown color block.

So the unknown color block is at the top.

So the initial blocks are:

1. Blue block

2. 3 black blocks

3. Unknown color block

Now the next part: "We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of blue block."

Wait perhaps I need to parse this correctly.

So after removing all blocks and adding one green block, then putting them back on top of each other. So perhaps we have a set of blocks including green and yellow?

Wait the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me try to parse:

"Question:

There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block. We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of blue block.

What color is the block we don't know the color of? Only answer in one word. Don't explain."

So perhaps:

First scenario:

- There are blocks: 3 black blocks, 1 unknown color block, and beneath them? Wait no.

The first part:

"There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block."

So:

- An unknown color block has 3 black blocks on top of it.

- Beneath those 3 black blocks is a blue block.

So the structure is:

Blue block is beneath the 3 black blocks, which are on top of the unknown color block.

So the order from bottom to top is:

Blue block

3 black blocks

Unknown color block

So total blocks: 1 (blue) + 3 + 1 (unknown) = 5 blocks.

Then the next part: "We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of blue block."

So removing all blocks and adding one green block. So total blocks now: original 5 + 1 green = 6 blocks? Or perhaps removing all blocks and adding one green and one yellow? Maybe not.

Wait perhaps:

We remove all existing blocks (the 5: blue, 3 black, unknown color block), then add one additional green block and one yellow block. So total blocks after removal and addition: 5 - 5 + 2 = 2? No, perhaps not.

Alternatively, perhaps "remove all blocks" meaning take all existing blocks and add one green block, making total blocks = original +1 green.

Then shuffle them and put them back on top of each other. So the new arrangement is shuffled.

Then the statement: The yellow block is on top of blue block.

So perhaps after shuffling, the yellow block is on top of blue block.

We need to find the color of the block we didn't know the color of initially.

So let me try to reconstruct.

First scenario:

Initial blocks:

- 3 black blocks

- 1 unknown color block

- 1 blue block

So total blocks: 5.

Then we remove all 5 blocks, add one green block and one yellow block. So total blocks now: 5 -5 + 2 = 2? Or perhaps remove all 5, add two new blocks: green and yellow. So total blocks: 5 -5 + 2 = 2? No, perhaps total blocks after removal and addition: 5 -5 + 2 = 2? Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps "remove all blocks" meaning take all existing blocks (blue, 3 black, unknown color) and add one green block. So total blocks: 4.

Then shuffle them and put them back on top of each other. Then the yellow block is on top of blue block.

Wait perhaps the process is:

Initially, we have:

- 3 black blocks

- 1 unknown color block

- 1 blue block

So total 5 blocks.

Then remove all 5 blocks, shuffle them, then add one green block and one yellow block? Or perhaps:

"We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other."

So perhaps total blocks after adding green and yellow: 5 + 2 =7 blocks? Or perhaps adding one green and one yellow, so total blocks become 5 + 2 =7.

But perhaps it's better to think in terms of colors.

We need to find the color of the block we didn't know the color of initially.

So initial setup:

We have
