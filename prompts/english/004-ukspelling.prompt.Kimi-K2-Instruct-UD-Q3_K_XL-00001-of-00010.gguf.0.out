I love the rainbows that pop up after a quick April shower. They start where the wet grass meets the sky, like a bright bridge made of sweets. Red is first, then orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet â€“ all in a neat line, as if the sky has sorted its crayons. The colours glow so much they look warm, even though the air is still cool. I run to the top of the small hill behind our house, boots squelching, and stand under the arc. It feels like a secret roof just for me. Birds fly through it and come out tinted pink and gold, as if they have been dipped in paint. When the sun peeks again, the rainbow fades, but a faint stripe stays on my sleeve where a drop landed. I keep that tiny stripe all day, proof that magic was real for three whole minutes.
