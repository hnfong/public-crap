### 3. Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.

Once upon a time, in a dense forest, the three little pigs—Tom, Dick, and Harry—had built their homes to protect themselves from the big, bad wolf. Tom's house was made of straw, Dick's of sticks, and Harry's of bricks. They had heard the wolf's threats and knew they needed to be cautious.

One sunny morning, as the pigs were enjoying a peaceful breakfast, they heard a knock on Harry's brick door. Harry, being the most cautious, peeked through a small window and saw a young girl in a red hood. She looked frightened and was carrying a basket.

"Please, can I come in?" the girl pleaded. "The big, bad wolf is chasing me!"

Harry quickly opened the door, and the girl, known as Little Red Riding Hood, rushed inside. She explained that she was on her way to visit her grandmother when the wolf had started chasing her.

The pigs, being kind and brave, decided to help. Tom and Dick, who had learned from their past encounters with the wolf, suggested they all work together to outsmart him. They came up with a plan to lure the wolf into a trap.

Harry, being the strongest, set up a large pot of boiling water in the backyard, while Tom and Dick gathered sticks and straw to create a distraction. Little Red Riding Hood, using her wit, went to the window and called out, "Wolf, wolf! I have a basket full of delicious treats for you!"

The wolf, lured by the promise of food, approached the house. As he got closer, Tom and Dick threw the sticks and straw, creating a commotion. The wolf, confused and angry, fell into the pot of boiling water, which Harry had cleverly disguised as a hiding spot.

The wolf yelped and ran away, never to return. The pigs and Little Red Riding Hood celebrated their victory. They shared the treats from the basket, and Little Red Riding Hood thanked the pigs for their bravery and kindness.

From that day on, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became the best of friends, and they often helped each other whenever danger loomed in the forest. They lived happily ever after, knowing that together, they could overcome any challenge.
