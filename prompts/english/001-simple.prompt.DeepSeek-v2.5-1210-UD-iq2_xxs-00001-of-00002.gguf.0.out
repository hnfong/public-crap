3. **Story of the Three Little Pigs and Little Red Riding Hood:**

Once upon a time, in a dense forest, the three little pigs built their homesâ€”one made of straw, one of sticks, and the third of bricks. One day, Little Red Riding Hood ventured into the forest to visit her grandmother, carrying a basket of goodies.

As she walked past the straw house, she heard a soft whimper. Curious, she peeked inside and found the first little pig shivering from the cold. "Why don't you build a stronger house?" she asked. The pig sighed, "I didn't have much time, so I used straw." Little Red Riding Hood offered him some of her warm soup and encouraged him to rebuild.

Next, she approached the stick house and found the second little pig struggling to keep the wind out. "A house of sticks won't protect you from the wolf," she said kindly. The pig nodded, grateful for her advice.

Finally, she reached the brick house, where the third little pig was safe and cozy. He invited her in for tea, and they shared stories of the wolf's mischief. Just as they finished, they heard a loud knock at the door. It was the wolf! He huffed and puffed, but the brick house stood firm.

Little Red Riding Hood cleverly distracted the wolf by offering him a piece of cake through the window. While the wolf was busy eating, she and the three little pigs called the forest ranger, who safely escorted the wolf away.

From that day on, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became good friends, always looking out for one another in the forest. [end of text]
