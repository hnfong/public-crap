Grammar mistakes (especially tense and "agreement" issues):

1. "So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence..." - The use of "are" is correct, but the sentence could be improved by specifying the time frame (e.g., "have been" or "are currently").

2. "In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG." - The use of "were" is correct, but the sentence could be improved by specifying the time frame (e.g., "had been" or "were").

3. "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down." - The use of "don't seem" is correct, but the sentence could be improved by specifying the time frame (e.g., "haven't been" or "aren't").

4. "And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard." - The use of "have seen" is correct, but the sentence could be improved by specifying the time frame (e.g., "had seen" or "have been seeing").

5. "In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid." - The use of "would have hated" is correct, but the sentence could be improved by specifying the time frame (e.g., "would have hated" or "would hate").

Serious stylistic issues:

1. "In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG." - The sentence is too long and could be broken into two sentences for clarity.

2. "That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations." - The sentence is too long and could be broken into two sentences for clarity.

3. "In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid." - The sentence is too long and could be broken into two sentences for clarity.

4. "With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency"." - The sentence is too long and could be broken into two sentences for clarity.

5. "Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another." - The sentence is too long and could be broken into two sentences for clarity.
