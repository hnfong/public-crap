1. The main thesis is that God, as a creator of all, inherently includes the possibility of suffering and evil, which are subjective experiences shaped by individual choices and perceptions.

2. Yes, I agree. The text suggests that suffering and evil are not inherent in God's creation but are the result of individual choices and perspectives. It emphasizes that while suffering exists, it is not a fundamental aspect of God's creation but rather a byproduct of human experience and perception.

3. In God's garden, where all blooms,  
Suffering whispers, "Why these blooms?"  
Yet in its heart, love gently sings,  
"In every thorn, there's beauty, in every sting."  

Through trials, we learn, we grow, we see,  
That suffering, though bitter, sets us free.  
For in its grasp, we find our strength,  
And in its light, our deepest truth. [end of text]
