# The Quiet Elf

My name is Aria, and I’m sixteen. I go to a normal high school in Hong Kong, and I have a secret that would make the whole school think I’m either a myth or a cosplay enthusiast. I’m a wood elf. Not the kind you see in movies with pointy ears and a bow, but the kind that lives in the forest, knows the names of trees, and can hear the wind whisper through bamboo. I’m also a teenager who has to remember to bring a pencil case, do homework, and pretend I’m not listening to the birds outside the window during math class.

I live with my human parents in a small apartment near the school. My mom is a nurse, and my dad is a graphic designer. They don’t know I’m an elf. They think I’m just a quiet kid who likes hiking and reading. I tell them I’m “into nature,” which is true, but I leave out the part where I can sense the heartbeat of a tree and feel the mood of a storm. I learned to keep my ears covered with my hair and to wear a beanie when it’s windy, because the pointy tips are hard to hide. I also learned to pretend I’m clumsy when I move too fast, because my body wants to glide.

School starts at eight. I wake up at six-thirty, which is early for a teenager, but I like the quiet before the city wakes up. I brush my teeth, eat a quick breakfast, and check my phone. My best friend, Mei, sends me a meme about a cat wearing a graduation cap. I send back a laughing emoji and a photo of a leaf I found on the way home yesterday. She replies with a heart and a “nice!” I smile. Mei is the only person who knows I’m different, and even she doesn’t know the whole truth. She thinks I’m just really good at spotting birds and that I have “good hearing.” She’s not wrong.

On the bus, I sit by the window. The city is a blur of neon and concrete, but I can still hear the river. It’s not a river, really; it’s a channel that cuts through the city, and it has a voice. It tells me about the rain that fell last night and the fish that swam upstream. I try not to stare at the water too long, because people might think I’m weird. I put on my earbuds and listen to a playlist Mei made for me. It’s mostly indie songs and some classical pieces that sound like wind through leaves.

First period is English. Mr. Lee is a kind man who always smells like coffee and old books. He asks us to write a short story about a character who has a secret. I sit at my desk, my pencil tapping against the paper. I think about my secret, and I write about a girl who can hear the trees. I don’t write about elves. I write about a girl who feels the city’s pulse and who knows the names of the plants that grow in cracks in the sidewalk. I write about a girl who is afraid to tell anyone, because she thinks they’ll think she’s strange. I write about a girl who is brave enough to keep listening, even when the world is loud.

Mr. Lee reads my story out loud. He says it’s “poetic” and “full of imagery.” I blush. Mei gives me a thumbs-up from across the room. I feel a little proud, and a little scared. I don’t want to be found out, but I also don’t want to hide forever.

Second period is math. I’m not great at math, but I’m good at patterns. I can see the rhythm in numbers, the way they repeat and flow. I can also see the rhythm in the way the teacher writes on the board, the way the chalk dust floats in the air, the way the fluorescent lights hum. I try to focus on the equations, but my mind wanders. I think about the forest I grew up in, the one I left when I was seven. I remember the smell of pine and the sound of rain on leaves. I remember my mother’s voice, soft and warm, telling me stories about the old trees and the spirits that lived in them. I remember my father’s hands, rough and gentle, teaching me how to carve a flute from a branch. I remember the day I decided to leave, because I wanted to see the world beyond the trees, and because I was curious about the humans who lived in the city.

Third period is history. We’re learning about the Silk Road. I like history because it’s full of stories, and stories are like trees. They have roots and branches, and they grow in unexpected places. I think about the elves who lived along the Silk Road, the ones who traded spices and songs with merchants. I think about how they kept their secrets, how they blended into the world without losing themselves. I think about how I’m doing the same thing now, in a different way, in a different time.

Lunch is in the cafeteria. I sit with Mei and a few other friends. We talk about homework, about the upcoming school festival, about the new boy in our class who plays guitar. Mei asks me if I’m going to join the nature club. I say I’m thinking about it. I’m not sure if I want to join a club that talks about plants and animals, because I already know so much about them. But maybe it would be nice to be around people who care about the same things I do, even if they don’t know the whole truth.

After school, I go to the park near my house. It’s a small park with a pond and a few trees. I sit on a bench and close my eyes. I listen to the city. I hear the cars, the people, the birds, the wind. I hear the pond, the frogs, the fish. I hear the trees, their slow, steady breathing. I feel the ground beneath my feet, the roots that stretch out beneath the concrete. I feel the pulse of the city, the way it moves and changes, the way it never stops. I feel the pulse of the forest, the way it waits and watches, the way it never forgets.

I take out my phone and call my mom. She answers on the second ring. “Hey, Aria. How was school?”

“It was good,” I say. “We wrote stories in English.”

“That’s nice. Did you have fun?”

“Yeah. I think I did.”

“Good. Don’t forget to do your math homework.”

“I won’t.”

I hang up and look at the pond. A duck swims by, its feathers ruffled by the wind. I smile. I think about my secret, and I think about my life. I think about how I’m a wood elf who goes to school, who writes stories, who does homework, who has friends, who loves her parents. I think about how I’m a teenager who is learning how to be human, and how I’m also learning how to be an elf in a world that doesn’t always believe in elves.

I stand up and walk home. The city is alive around me, and I am alive in it. I am a secret, but I am also a story. I am a wood elf, and I am a teenage student. I am both, and I am learning how to be both without losing either.

When I get home, I do my math homework. I write a story about a girl who can hear the trees. I eat dinner with my parents. I tell them about my day. I go to bed. I close my eyes, and I listen to the wind. I listen to the city. I listen to the forest. I listen to my own heartbeat, steady and strong, like a tree that has grown for a hundred years.

I am Aria. I am sixteen. I am a wood elf. I am a student. I am a secret. I am a story. I am alive. [end of text]
