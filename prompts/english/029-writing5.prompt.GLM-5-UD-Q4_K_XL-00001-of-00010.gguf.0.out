# The Secret of Wing Lok

Every morning, I take the MTR from Tuen Mun to Central. The journey is long, about 45 minutes, but I don't mind. I like to watch the city wake up through the window—the buildings getting taller, the people getting more.

My name is Elara, and I am Form 4 student at St. Margaret's College. I have black hair, brown eyes, and I look like any other Hong Kong girl. But there is something nobody knows.

I am a wood elf.

***

The hardest part of hiding my secret is the uniform. Our school uniform is made of polyester blend, which is... not comfortable for someone like me. Synthetic fabric makes my skin itch and feels like wearing a plastic bag. Wood elves have very sensitive connection to natural materials. My grandmother, who is also elf but lives in Sai Kung countryside, sewed cotton lining into my blazer secretly. Without this, I think I would go crazy.

"Elara, are you listening?"

I blink. Mrs. Wong, my Chinese History teacher, is looking at me with sharp eyes.

"Sorry, Mrs. Wong," I say quickly. "I was... thinking about the Qing Dynasty."

Some students laugh. Mrs. Wong sighs. "Please pay attention. This topic will be on the exam."

I nod, but my attention is already drifting again. The classroom has one small window, and through it, I can see a single tree in the courtyard below. A banyan tree. It calls to me quietly—not in words, but in feelings. The tree is stressed because construction workers damaged some roots last week. I want to go down there and heal it, but how can I explain that?

***

Lunch time is my favorite time. Not because of the food (the canteen food is only okay), but because I can escape.

I tell my friends I'm going to library, but instead I go to the rooftop garden on the fifth Floor. The school started this garden last year as "green initiative." Most students don't come here—it's too hot, too many mosquitoes. But for me, it's the only place I can breathe.

There are some tomato plants, some basil, and a small papaya tree in the corner. I sit next to the papaya tree and touch its leaves gently.

"You're doing well," I whisper in Elvish. The language sounds like wind through leaves. "But you need more water. The soil is too dry."

The tree seems to sigh with relief at my presence. I close my eyes and let my awareness spread through the plant. I can feel its hunger for sunlight, its thirst, its small struggle against the city pollution. For a few minutes, I am not a teenage girl worrying about DSE exams. I am just... connected.

"Elara?"

I jump and pull my hand away quickly. It's Chloe, my classmate. She's holding a sandwich and looking at me with curious face.

"I thought you were in library," she says. "What are you doing here?"

"Just... looking at the plants." I try to sound normal. "They're interesting, right?"

Chloe looks at the papaya tree, then at me. "You're weird, you know that? But in a good way." She sits down next to me. "Hey, do you want to study together after school? For the math test?"

I should say yes. Chloe is smart and good at math. But today is Wednesday, and on Wednesday, I have somewhere important to go.

"Sorry, I have... family thing."

"Again?" Chloe looks disappointed. "You always have family thing on Wednesday."

I don't know how to explain that every Wednesday, I take the minibus to Tai Po, and then I hike into the forest where nobody goes. There, I can finally take off my shoes and feel real earth under my feet. I can let my ears show their true pointed shape (I use special tape to hide them every day). I can speak to the old trees that still remember when Hong Kong was covered in forest.

"Next week," I promise. "Wednesday next week, we can study."

After school, I walk through Central with thousands of other people. The streets are crowded, the air is thick with car exhaust and restaurant smells. Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning in concrete and steel.

But then I see something—a small sparrow sitting on a street sign. It looks at me, and I look at it. For a moment, I feel less alone.

We are still here, the sparrow seems to say. We are still here, even in the city.

I smile and continue walking. Being a wood elf in Hong Kong is not easy. Sometimes I feel like I'm living two lives—one as a regular student worrying about grades and friendships, and one as a guardian of nature that nobody knows about.

But maybe that's okay. Maybe both lives are real.

On the MTR going home, I open my biology textbook. There's a chapter about photosynthesis. The textbook explains it in scientific terms—chlorophyll, sunlight, carbon dioxide. But I know there's more to it. I know that plants can feel, can communicate, can remember.

I highlight some important terms for the test. My phone buzzes—a message from Chloe asking about homework. I reply quickly, then look out the window again.

The sun is setting over Victoria Harbour. The sky turns orange and pink. For a moment, the whole city looks golden, and I can almost pretend that the buildings are trees, that the streets are rivers, that Hong Kong is a forest of light.

Almost.

I am Elara, Form 4 student, wood elf in hiding. And tomorrow, I will wake up and do it all again—tape my ears, wear my uncomfortable uniform, pretend to be normal.

But tonight, I will dream of forests.

*Author's Note: Thank you for reading my story. I tried to show how it feels like to be different but still try your best to fit in. Also, I think Hong Kong has many hidden nature spots that people forget about because the city is so busy. Maybe we should all pay more attention to the plants around us, elf or not!* [end of text]
