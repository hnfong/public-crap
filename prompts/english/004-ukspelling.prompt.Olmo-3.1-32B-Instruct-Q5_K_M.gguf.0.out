I like the rainbows that appear after a summer storm. They are soft and bright, stretching from the grey sky to the green fields. The colours are clear: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. They glow gently, like a promise that the rain is over.

I stand in the muddy grass, my shoes squelching, and watch the rainbow shimmer above the hedgerow. It looks like a ribbon someone has tied across the sky. Sometimes, the sun peeks out, making the colours even stronger.

I remember my mum saying rainbows are magic. I believe her. For a moment, everything feels peaceful. The birds sing, and the air smells fresh. I wish I could catch that rainbow and keep it in a jar, but I know it’s better to let it fade away, waiting for the next storm. [end of text]
