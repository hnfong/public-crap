Here’s a breakdown of the issues in your text, categorized by **grammar**, **serious stylistic issues**, and **other problems**. I’ve focused on the most critical errors and omissions, excluding minor stylistic quirks.

---

### **Grammar Issues**
1. **Subject-verb agreement (plural vs. singular)**
   - *"In America We Trust they're capitalist enough..."*
     - **"We"** is plural, but the verb **"are"** is missing. Should be: *"In America, we trust they're capitalist enough..."* (or rephrase for clarity).
     - Alternatively, if you mean the U.S. as a collective, *"In America, we trust that..."* (but this is still awkward; better to say *"In America, capitalism is strong enough..."*).

2. **Incorrect verb tense (mixed tenses in complex sentences)**
   - *"I had no ounce of doubt that they **can** cut costs..."*
     - **"Can"** is present tense, but the rest of the sentence is in past tense (*"I had no doubt"* → *"they **could** cut costs"*).
     - Correct: *"I had no doubt that they **could** cut costs..."*

3. **Misplaced or dangling modifier**
   - *"And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault..."*
     - **"To"** is missing before *"seem"*. Should be: *"And while this might **seem to be** an unwarranted assault..."*
     - Alternatively, *"And while this **seems like** an unwarranted assault..."* (more natural).

4. **Incorrect article usage (a/an/the)**
   - *"the free money is draining away"*
     - **"The"** implies a specific instance of "free money," but this is a general concept. Better: *"Free money is draining away"* (no article) or *"The era of free money is ending."*

5. **Incorrect preposition (word choice)**
   - *"I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something"*
     - **"Onto"** is correct here (meaning "aware of"), but the phrasing is slightly off. More natural: *"I can't help but agree that he's probably **right about** something..."* or *"I can't help but agree that he's **onto something**."* (Your original is fine, but *"right about"* is more common in this context.)

6. **Incorrect pronoun reference**
   - *"Those who read history knows..."*
     - **"Read"** should be **"reads"** (subject-verb agreement: *"Those who read"* is plural, but *"history"* is singular. However, the real issue is that *"those who read history"* is the subject, so the verb should agree with *"those"* (plural). Correct: *"Those who read history **know**..."*

7. **Incorrect comparative form**
   - *"as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market"*
     - **"Shitty"** is informal and jarring in this context, but the real issue is the lack of parallel structure. Better: *"as good/bad as any random gig"* or *"as great or shitty as any random gig"* (but the latter is still awkward). A cleaner version: *"as good or as bad as any random gig."*

8. **Incorrect verb form (gerund vs. infinitive)**
   - *"I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some..."*
     - This is grammatically correct, but the phrasing is slightly off. More natural: *"I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea **to buy** some..."* (your version is fine, but *"whether it would be a good idea to buy"* is smoother).

9. **Incorrect use of "back when" (tense consistency)**
   - *"back when tech stocks were down last year"*
     - If you're writing this in 2024, *"last year"* is now in the past, so *"were"* is correct. However, if you're writing this in 2023 (when "last year" would be 2022), *"were"* would still be correct, but the phrasing is slightly confusing. Better: *"back when tech stocks were down (in 2023)"* or *"when tech stocks were down last year (2023)"* (if written in 2024).

10. **Incorrect possessive form**
    - *"McKinsey Pichai"*
      - This is a proper noun (a person's name), but the possessive is incorrectly applied. Sundar Pichai is the CEO of Google, not McKinsey. Correct: *"Sundar Pichai"* (or *"Pichai"* if you're being informal, but *"McKinsey Pichai"* is nonsensical).

### **Serious Stylistic Issues**
1. **Overuse of informal/controversial language**
   - *"predatory capitalist attitude"*
     - This is a loaded term and may alienate readers who don’t share your perspective. While it fits your tone, it’s not neutral or universally acceptable. Consider rephrasing for broader appeal: *"short-term profit-driven behavior"* or *"cutthroat corporate strategies."*

2. **Inconsistent tone (shift from analytical to rant-like)**
   - The text starts with a measured critique of Andreessen Horowitz but quickly descends into a mix of financial analysis, ideological rant, and personal anecdote. The shift from *"the logic is solid"* to *"In America We Trust"* is jarring. Consider separating these ideas into distinct paragraphs or sections.

3. **Un
