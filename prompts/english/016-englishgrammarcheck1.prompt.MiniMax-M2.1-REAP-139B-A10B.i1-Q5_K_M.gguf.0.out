**Grammar / tense / agreement errors**

1. "people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence" – the verb "are not doing" is fine, but the clause that follows ("to justify their existence") is a purpose infinitive that should be "to justify their existence" (no change needed). However, the sentence as a whole is a fragment; it should be integrated into a full sentence.

2. "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective." – "onto something" is idiomatic, but the phrase "at least from the capitalist perspective" is awkward; better: "at least from a capitalist perspective."

3. "back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG." – "in particular" should be "in particular, META and GOOG" (comma needed).

4. "My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down." – "monopolies" is not a word; should be "monopolies" (no, that's not right either).
