1. The main thesis of the text is that suffering and evil in the world are subjective experiences chosen by individuals, and God's role is to create everything, including all possibilities, while nurturing and supporting all creations.

2. I partially agree. While subjective experiences shape our perceptions, the existence of suffering and evil cannot be entirely dismissed as mere belief, as they have real-world consequences and impacts on individuals.

3. 
```
In God's vast creation, all is born,
From stars to souls, the cosmos torn.
We choose our path, our view, our plight,
Subjective worlds, both dark and bright.

Suffering's a choice, a thought, a creed,
Yet real it feels, where hearts do bleed.
Move through the maze, reshape your fate,
In God's embrace, find solace, wait.
``` [end of text]
