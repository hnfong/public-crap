In this scenario, Bob claims to have eaten a dish made with aged organic milk, seasoned tomato purée, and baked whole wheat. However, Alice's reaction of "wtf" suggests that the dish may not have been what she expected or that it looked unappetizing.

What Bob ate: Bob's description suggests he ate a dish where aged organic milk was poured over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat. This could be interpreted as a sort of open-faced sandwich or a flatbread with a tomato sauce and aged milk topping.

Was it healthy? The ingredients Bob mentions can be considered healthy:
- Aged organic milk can be a source of calcium, protein, and probiotics if it's fermented or contains live cultures. However, aged milk can also be high in fat and calories depending on the type (whole milk vs. skim milk).
- Seasoned tomato purée is a good source of vitamins A and C, lycopene, and fiber.
- Baked whole wheat is a whole grain, which is a good source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals.

However, the healthiness of the dish depends on the proportions of each ingredient and how they are prepared. If the aged milk is high in fat and used in large quantities, the dish could be high in calories and fat. Additionally, the seasoning used on the tomato purée could add extra sodium or sugar, affecting the overall healthiness.

Alice's reaction of "wtf" might be due to the dish looking unappealing, the combination of ingredients seeming odd, or perhaps the dish not matching her expectations of what constitutes "healthy" food. Without more context, it's hard to determine exactly why Alice reacted that way.

In summary, Bob ate a dish made with aged organic milk, seasoned tomato purée, and baked whole wheat, which could be considered healthy depending on the preparation and proportions of the ingredients. Alice's reaction suggests surprise or disbelief, possibly due to the dish's appearance or her own expectations of healthy food. [end of text]
