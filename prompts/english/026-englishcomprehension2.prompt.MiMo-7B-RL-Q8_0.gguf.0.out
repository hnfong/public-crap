Okay, let's try to figure out this block problem. So, the setup is: originally, there are 3 black blocks on top of a block whose color we don't know. Beneath those 3 black blocks is a blue block. Then, we remove all the blocks (so the blue block is now the bottom one?) and shuffle them with an additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. After shuffling, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. The question is: what color is the block we don't know the color of?

Hmm. Let me break this down step by step. Let's start by visualizing the original stack. From top to bottom, it would be: 3 black blocks, then the unknown block (let's call its color X), then the blue block. Wait, wait. Wait, the problem says "there are 3 black blocks on top of a block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block." So maybe the structure is: top layer is 3 black blocks, then the unknown block, then the blue block at the bottom? Or is the blue block beneath the 3 black blocks? Let me parse that sentence again.

Original description: "There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block." Hmm. So "on top of an block" (the unknown block) would mean that the unknown block is below the 3 black blocks. Then "beneath them" (the 3 black blocks) is the blue block. Wait, that might be confusing. Let me try to structure it.

If the 3 black blocks are on top of the unknown block, then the unknown block is beneath them. Then beneath the unknown block is the blue block. So the original stack from top to bottom would be: 3 black blocks, then the unknown block (color X), then the blue block. Wait, but the problem says "beneath them [the 3 black blocks] there is a blue block." So maybe the blue block is directly beneath the 3 black blocks, meaning the unknown block is not there? Wait, the wording is a bit tricky.

Wait, the first sentence: "There are 3 black blocks on top of an block that we don't know the color of and beneath them there is a blue block." So "on top of an block" (the unknown block). So the unknown block is the one that the 3 black blocks are on top of. Then beneath the 3 black blocks (so below them) is the blue block. Wait, but if the 3 black blocks are on top of the unknown block, then the unknown block is between the 3 black blocks and the blue block? Or is the blue block beneath the unknown block?

Let me try to diagram this. Let's say the original stack is:

Top: 3 black blocks

Then: unknown block (color X)

Then: blue block (bottom)

But the problem says "beneath them [the 3 black blocks] there is a blue block." So if the 3 black blocks are on top of the unknown block, then beneath the 3 black blocks would be the unknown block, and beneath that would be the blue block. So the blue block is at the very bottom. So original stack from top to bottom: 3 black blocks, unknown block (X), blue block.

Then, we remove all blocks. Wait, does that mean removing all the blocks from the stack? So we take them all apart. Then we shuffle the blocks with one additional green block. So the original blocks were 3 black, 1 unknown (X), 1 blue. Then we add a green block, making total of 5 blocks: 3 black, 1 X, 1 blue, 1 green. Then we shuffle them and put them back on top of each other. After that, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. Wait, but where is the yellow block coming from? The original problem mentions adding a green block, but not a yellow one. Wait, maybe there's a typo? Or perhaps I misread.

Wait, let me check again. The problem says: "shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of blue block." Wait, the yellow block is mentioned here, but previously it was a green block added. That seems contradictory. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement? Or perhaps the yellow block was part of the original blocks? Wait, the original blocks are 3 black, one unknown, and beneath them is a blue block. So the original blocks are 3 black, 1 X, 1 blue. Then we add a green block, making total of 5 blocks. Then after shuffling, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. But where is the yellow block coming from? The problem didn't mention a yellow block before. Unless maybe the unknown block was yellow? Wait, the question is asking for the color of the unknown block. So perhaps the yellow block is the unknown block? Let me see.

Wait, the problem says: "We remove all blocks and shuffle the blocks with one additional green block, then put them back on top of each other. The yellow block is on top of blue block." So after removing all blocks (the original ones), we have the 3 black blocks, the unknown block (X), the blue block, and then we add a green block. Then we shuffle all these (including the green one) and put them back. Then, in the new stack, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. Wait, but the problem added a green block, not a yellow one. So maybe the yellow block is the green block? Or perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the unknown block was yellow. Let me try to figure this out.

Wait, perhaps the original blocks include a yellow block? No, the problem says there are 3 black blocks on top of the unknown block, which is on top of the blue block. So the original blocks are 3 black, 1 X, 1 blue. Then we add a green block. So total blocks after adding green: 3 black, 1 X, 1 blue, 1 green. Then shuffled and put back. The result is that the yellow block is on top of the blue block. But where is the yellow block coming from? Unless the unknown block X is yellow. Because if X is yellow, then after shuffling, the yellow block (the X) could end up on top of the blue block. But the problem added a green block, so maybe the green block is now somewhere else. Wait, but the problem says "the yellow block is on top of the blue block." So the yellow block must be one of the original blocks. The original blocks are 3 black, 1 X, 1 blue. So the only possible yellow block is the unknown block X. Therefore, X must be yellow. Because after shuffling, the yellow block (which is X) is on top of the blue block. Therefore, the unknown block is yellow. So the answer is yellow.

Wait, but let me check again. The problem says we added a green block. So the green block is part of the shuffled blocks. But the result is that the yellow block is on top of the blue block. So the yellow block must be one of the original blocks. The original blocks are 3 black, 1 X, 1 blue. So the only non-blue, non-black block is X. Therefore, X must be yellow. Therefore, the answer is yellow.

But wait, maybe the green block is the one on top? But the problem says the yellow block is on top of the blue block. So the yellow block is above the blue block. If the green block was added, maybe the green block is somewhere else. But the problem specifically mentions the yellow block. Therefore, the unknown block must be yellow. Therefore, the answer is yellow.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let's go through the steps again. Original stack: 3 black blocks on top of X, which is on top of blue block. So the original order from top to bottom: black, black, black, X, blue. Then we remove all blocks. So we have the 3 black, X, blue. Then we add a green block. Now we have 3 black, X, blue, green. Shuffle these 5 blocks and put them back. The result is that the yellow block is on top of the blue block. So in the new stack, the top block is yellow, and below it is blue? Or is the yellow block somewhere above the blue block? The problem says "the yellow block is on top of blue block," which would mean that the yellow block is directly above the blue block. So in the final stack, there's a yellow block immediately above the blue block. Since the blue block was originally at the bottom, but after shuffling, its position could have changed. However, the problem states that after shuffling, the yellow block is on top of the blue block. Therefore, the blue block is somewhere in the stack, and above it is the yellow block. Since the only possible yellow block is X, then X must be yellow. Therefore, the answer is yellow.

But wait, could the green block be the one on top? The problem says we added a green block, so maybe the green block is now on top, but the problem says the yellow block is on top of the blue block. Therefore, the yellow block must be X. Therefore, X is yellow. So the answer is yellow.

Yes, that makes sense. The key is that the yellow block mentioned in the final configuration must be the unknown block X, because the added green block is a different color. Therefore, the unknown block must be yellow.
