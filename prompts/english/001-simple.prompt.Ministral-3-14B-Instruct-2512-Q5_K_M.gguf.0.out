### **3. A Short Story: *The Three Little Pigs and Little Red Riding Hood***

One sunny afternoon, as the three little pigs—**Brickhouse, Twiggy, and Strawberry**—were enjoying their strawberry jam by the edge of the forest, they heard a familiar voice calling out.

*"Oh dear! Oh dear! I’m lost, and the wolf is chasing me!"*

It was **Little Red Riding Hood**, her basket of goodies tumbling as she ran toward them, her hood askew and her cheeks flushed from fear.

Brickhouse, the strongest of the brothers, stepped forward. *"Don’t worry, Red! We’ll help you. But first—what’s this about a wolf?"*

Little Red panted, *"He tricked me! Said he was my grandma, but his eyes were too yellow, and his teeth—oh, his teeth were *far* too sharp!"*

Twiggy, the quick-thinking middle pig, scratched his head. *"That’s not right. Grandma’s house is *that* way!"* He pointed toward the woods where the pigs’ own homes stood.

Strawberry gasped. *"Wait… the wolf *ate* Grandma?!"*

Just then, a deep, rumbling voice echoed from the trees:
*"Little pigs… and a *delicious* little hood. How fortunate for me!"*

The **Big Bad Wolf** emerged, his fur matted and his grin wide. But this time, the pigs weren’t alone.

Brickhouse crossed his arms. *"You’re not scaring us, furball. We’ve got *plans*."*

Twiggy grinned. *"And Red here’s got an idea!"*

Little Red, clutching her basket, pulled out a **handful of magic strawberries**—the same ones she’d been taking to her grandmother. *"These aren’t just for baking,"* she said. *"They’re *enchanted*."*

One by one, she fed the wolf a strawberry. His eyes widened as his fur began to **glow pink**, his claws turning soft, and his snarl melting into a giggle. *"I—I can’t stop sneezing! And my teeth… they’re *itchy*!"*

The wolf, now more **puppy than predator**, wagged his tail. *"I think… I think I’ve been *cursed*!"*

The pigs and Red exchanged glances. *"Well,"* said Strawberry, *"looks like you’re stuck with us now."*

And so, the **Three Little Pigs, Little Red Riding Hood, and the (mostly) reformed wolf** lived happily ever after—though the wolf *did* have to promise never to eat grandmas (or pigs) again… unless they were *strawberry-shaped*.

**The End.** 🐺🍓🐷
