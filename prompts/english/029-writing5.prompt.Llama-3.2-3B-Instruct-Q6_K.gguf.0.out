Me, Wong Wing, sit in class, try my best to pay attention. Teacher, Mrs. Lee, talk about math problem, but me mind wander. Me think about forest, about trees, about sunlight filtering through leaves. Me feel like me belong in forest, not in school.

Me no tell anyone, but me have secret. Me, Wong Wing, wood elf. Me live in Hong Kong, but me not like city life. Me miss forest, miss trees, miss fresh air. Me try to blend in, but me not very good at it. Me always get confused with human students, they no understand me. Me try to speak like them, but me still slip up. Me say "me" instead of "I", "me" instead of "I".

Me sit next to friend, Emily, she no know me secret. She think me just weird, but me no mind. Me like Emily, she nice and kind. Me sit next to her, try to focus on lesson.

But me have hard time. Me have to wear human clothes, me have to eat human food. Me miss forest berries, miss fresh water. Me feel like me trapped in human world.

Me try to find way to escape, but me no know how. Me no know how to leave Hong Kong, how to find forest again. Me feel like me stuck.

But me no give up. Me keep trying, keep learning. Me practice English, me practice human ways. Me want to fit in, but me no want to lose self.

Me sit in class, me listen to Mrs. Lee. Me think about forest, about trees, about sunlight. Me feel like me belong in forest, not in school. But me no give up. Me keep trying, keep dreaming.

After class, me walk home with Emily. We talk about school, about life. Me try to speak like human, but me still slip up. Emily laugh, me feel happy. Me like Emily, me like life.

Me sit in room, me write in journal. Me write about forest, about trees, about sunlight. Me feel like me belong in forest, not in school. But me no give up. Me keep trying, keep dreaming.

Me, Wong Wing, wood elf, but me no care. Me just want to be happy, to be free. Me will find way, me will find forest. Me will be home. [end of text]
