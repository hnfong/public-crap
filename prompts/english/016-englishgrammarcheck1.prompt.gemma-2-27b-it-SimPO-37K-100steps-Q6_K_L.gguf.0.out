So there's a running story about Andreessen Horowitz basically saying people in big tech companies are not doing enough real work to justify their existence... 

And while this might seem to an unwarranted assault on the work ethic of tech workers (who I'm sure are mostly diligent and hardworking), I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something, at least from the capitalist perspective.

In fact, back when tech stocks were down last year, I briefly wondered whether it would be a good idea to buy some at the relatively low prices -- in particular META and GOOG. My analysis back then was exactly on the same line of logic -- while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable of creating new products and finding new avenues of growth, it seems their monopolies are still functional and they can probably squeeze quite a bit of profit from the monopolies before things break down. That, and when shareholders are unhappy, they can always layoff more people to reduce costs and increase margins and profit, and I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations. And as we've seen with their (GOOG mainly) first round of layoffs in early 2023, McKinsey Pichai is definitely ready to do whatever pleases the shareholders in this regard.

In the end I didn't make any trades, if only because I would have hated how I participated and enabled this kind of predatory capitalist attitude -- but ideological concerns aside, the logic is solid. The only risk is basically regulatory (antitrust), but In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose. (There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn... I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years -- tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift.)

With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone (besides small pockets of AI, which in practice currently is operationally much smaller than general tech), the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over to ensure financial "efficiency".  This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation until the labor supply/demand reaches equilibrium (i.e. these jobs are going to be as great/shitty as any random gig in the general job market), and product enshittification until antitrust slams down hard. Those who read history knows -- every industry goes through this phrase in some form or another. Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance. That said, it has been a fun ride.

I mean, people who know approximately how much I make by referencing levels.fyi or otherwise might wonder why I live so frugally -- it's obvious by now, the party's gonna end sooner or later.  People in more mature industries generally have a reasonable expectation what their careers would look like in say 20 years (and generally can expect salary to be monotonic-increasing).  But I always knew we're in a state of flux.  Saving up for "FI" isn't an aspiration -- it's a survival necessity in this industry, especially as I'm geographically misplaced (there's actually no tech jobs here) and my technical expertise is... in some funny stack that nobody in their right mind uses (we're still sane though, just unique circumstances).

## Grammar Mistakes:

1. **Tense inconsistency:** "**while META and GOOG (and particularly GOOG) don't seem to be capable**... **it seems their monopolies are still functional**" mixes present tense ("don't seem", "seems") with a timeless perspective ("are still functional"). Maintain consistent present tense for analysis.
2. **Subject-verb agreement:** "**There's also a concern whether the companies will remain healthy enough for investors (as a whole) to recoup their capital investments before the companies crash and burn**..." "Concern" is singular, requiring "is" instead of "are".
3. **Pronoun ambiguity:** "**Those who read history knows**..."  "Those" is plural, demanding "know".
4. **Incorrect tense in conditional:** "**I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG will be like in say 15 years**..." Use future tense consistently: "**I'm not sure I can accurately predict what GOOG *will be* like**..."
5. **Mixed tenses in consequence:** "**With interest rates still held "high", the free money is draining away, and with promises of revolutionary tech largely gone... the ruthless capitalist engine is taking over**..." Shifts from present perfect continuous ("is draining") to simple present ("is taking over"). Maintain consistency, likely present continuous throughout.

## Serious Stylistic Issues:

1. **Overly colloquial tone:** Phrases like "**enshittification**", "**party's gonna end**", "**in some funny stack**" detract from professionalism and analytical depth.
2. **Run-on sentences:** Several sentences are excessively long and convoluted, hindering clarity (e.g., the paragraph starting with "In fact, back when tech stocks..."). Break them down for better readability.
3. **Informal abbreviations/slang:** "**FI**" (Financial Independence) should be spelled out for broader audience comprehension, especially in a piece analyzing systemic trends.
4. **Lack of transitions:** Paragraphs jump between ideas abruptly. Smoother transitions (e.g., "Furthermore", "However", "Consequently") would improve flow.
5. **Excessive parentheticals:** Overuse of "(...)" interrupts the narrative and feels cluttered. Integrate information more seamlessly within sentences.

## Other Problems:

1. **Assumptions without evidence:** Claims like "**tech companies can fail REALLY fast once there's a paradigm shift**" lack specific historical examples for substantiation. Provide concrete instances.
2. **Overgeneralization:** Statements like "**every industry goes through this phrase**" simplify complex realities. Acknowledge nuances and variations across sectors.
3. **Limited scope:** Focus solely on large tech neglects the experiences of startups, SMEs, and alternative tech models, presenting an incomplete picture.
4. **Subjective framing:** While acknowledging ideological concerns, the text leans heavily on a "capitalist engine" perspective, potentially overlooking alternative economic viewpoints and solutions.
5. **Lack of concrete solutions:** While critiquing the current state, the piece offers limited proactive suggestions beyond personal frugality, leaving readers wanting actionable insights. [end of text]
