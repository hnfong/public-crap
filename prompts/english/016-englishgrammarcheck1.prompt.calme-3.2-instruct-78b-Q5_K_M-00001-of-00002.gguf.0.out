[This analysis focuses on the requested categories and avoids minor stylistic or sentence structure issues.]

Mistakes in Grammar (Tense and Agreement Issues):
- [Tense inconsistency] "I can't help but agree that he's probably onto something" should be "I couldn't help but agree that he was probably onto something" for consistency with the past tense context.
- [Tense inconsistency] "In America We Trust they're capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose" should be "In America We Trusted they were capitalist enough to not kill their golden goose" for consistency with the past tense context.
- [Tense inconsistency] "This necessarily involves layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation" should be "This necessarily involved layoffs and wage cuts/stagnation" for consistency with the past tense context.
- [Tense inconsistency] "Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets isn't True Abundance" should be "Abundance in isolated, privileged pockets wasn't True Abundance" for consistency with the past tense context.
- [Tense inconsistency] "But I always knew we're in a state of flux" should be "But I always knew we were in a state of flux" for subject-verb agreement in past tense.

Stylistic Issues (Serious):
- [Inconsistent tone] The text shifts between a formal analysis and an informal tone, which can be confusing for the reader. For instance, the use of "So" at the beginning and "I mean" in the middle are conversational, while the rest of the text is analytical.
- [Inconsistent perspective] The text starts with a third-person perspective discussing Andreessen Horowitz, then shifts to a first-person perspective discussing personal experiences and opinions. This can be jarring and should be managed more smoothly.
- [Lack of clarity] The phrase "I had no ounce of doubt that they can cut costs by almost half without really affecting day to day operations" could be clearer by specifying whether "they" refers to the companies or the people being laid off.
- [Inappropriate use of colloquialism] "McKinsey Pichai" is a colloquial term that may not be appropriate in a text that aims to be taken seriously, as it could be seen as disrespectful or unprofessional.
- [Inconsistent use of acronyms] The text uses "GOOG" and "META" as acronyms, but does not consistently use them throughout, sometimes referring to the companies as "Google" and "Meta" instead. This inconsistency can confuse readers.
