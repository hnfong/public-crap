Consider this scenario:

Alice: Are you eating healthy?
Bob: Yes! Today I ate aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat.
Alice: Wow! Let me see.
Bob: (sends Alice a photo)
Alice: wtf

Question: what happened? What did Bob eat and was it healthy?

 [/INST] Based on the information provided, Bob claimed to have eaten aged organic milk tossed over seasoned tomato purée spread on baked whole wheat. This can be considered a healthy meal as it includes whole grains, organic dairy, and tomatoes, which are all nutritious ingredients.

However, the conversation takes an unexpected turn when Alice reacts with "wtf" after seeing the photo Bob sent. This reaction suggests that there might have been something in the photo that was not consistent with what Bob described, or it could be that the presentation of the meal was unusual or unappetizing. Without seeing the photo, it's difficult to determine the exact reason for Alice's reaction.
