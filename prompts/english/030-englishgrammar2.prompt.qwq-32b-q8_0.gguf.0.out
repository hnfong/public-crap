Okay, let's tackle these sentences one by one. The user wants the English translations to be simple, fluent, and sound like a native speaker. Let me start with the first one.

1. Original: "Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?" Hmm, "hurry" here is a verb, but the structure "Why are you hurry?" isn't correct. It should be "hurrying" to make it continuous. Also, "worry that they won't wait for you" is okay, but maybe "worry they won't wait for you" without "that" is more natural. So combining both parts into a smoother sentence: "Why are you in such a rush? There's no need to worry—they'll wait for you." That sounds better and more conversational.

2. Original: "He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids." The structure here is two separate clauses. Maybe combine them with a comma or a different conjunction. "Magnanimous" is a bit formal. "Haggle over" might not be the best word here. The Cantonese says "唔同班𡃁仔計較", which is more like "doesn't bother to argue with the kids over small things." So maybe "He's a generous person who doesn't bother arguing with the kids over trivial matters." That's simpler and flows better.

3. Original: "There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it." The semicolon is okay, but maybe a comma or a different structure. "Learn a language" should be "learning a language" to make it a gerund. Also, "massive exposure" is correct, but "immersion" might be a better term here. So: "There's no shortcut to learning a language; the key is immersion." That's concise and natural.

4. Original: "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender." The phrase "for her being very tender" is a bit awkward. "Tender" might not be the best word here. The Cantonese uses "温柔" which is more like "gentle" or "kind." Also, "praises... for her being" could be rephrased as "praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for being so kind." Or even more naturally: "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for how kind she is." That's smoother.

5. Original: "I take the metro to school every day." This one seems fine. It's simple and correct. No changes needed here.

Let me double-check each suggestion to ensure they're natural and match the original meaning. For sentence 2, "班𡃁仔" refers to a group of kids, so "the kids" is okay. "Trivial matters" works for "trivial issues." For sentence 4, "tender" might still be okay, but "kind" is more common. Alternatively, "gentle" could also work. The user might prefer "kind" as it's more commonly used in such contexts. 

Alright, I think these modifications should make the sentences sound more natural while keeping the original intent.
