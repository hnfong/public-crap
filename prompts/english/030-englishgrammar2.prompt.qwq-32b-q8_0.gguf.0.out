Here are a couple sentences in both Cantonese and English. They are written by somebody who is a native Cantonese speaker, but not necessarily good in English. Review the English translations and suggest modifications, keeping in mind sentences should be simple, fluent, written like a native speaker, and to the point. If the sentence does not need changes, just output the original sentence.

For example:

A. 啲貨咁好賣，唔使慌賺唔到錢喎。 The goods are selling so well, there's no need to fear that you cannot earn money.
B. 美國每四年會舉行一次總統選舉。 The United States will held a presidential election every four years.

Expected output:

A. Suggested sentence: The goods are selling so well, you don't need to worry about not making money.
B. Suggested sentence: The United States holds a presidential election every four years.

Here are the sentences for you to review. In your answer, give one suggested English translation per sentence, or just output the original sentence if no changes are needed.

1. 你咁趕做咩啫，你慌人哋唔等你咩？ Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?
2. 佢份人夠大量，唔同班𡃁仔計較。 He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids.
3. 學語文冇捷徑，要靠大量浸淫。 There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it.
4. 小新喺同事面前讚美女朋友有幾温柔。 Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender.
5. 我日日都搭地鐵返學。 I take the metro to school every day.

Okay, let's tackle these sentences one by one. The user wants the English translations to be simple, fluent, and sound like a native speaker. I need to check each original translation and see where improvements can be made.

Starting with sentence 1: "Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?" The first part "Why are you hurry?" should probably be "Why are you in such a hurry?" because "hurry" as a noun here makes more sense. The second part is okay, but maybe "worry that they won't wait for you" can be phrased more naturally. Maybe "Why worry? They'll wait for you anyway." That's more concise and natural.

Sentence 2: "He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids." The word "haggle" is a bit strong here. The original Cantonese uses "班𡃁仔" which might mean "those kids" or "peers." Maybe "He's a generous person who doesn't bother with petty arguments with the others." "Magnanimous" is correct, but "bother with petty arguments" sounds more natural than "haggle over trivial issues."

Sentence 3: "There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it." The original translation is okay, but "massive exposure" might be better as "大量浸淫" translates to "immersion" rather than just exposure. So changing it to "the key is immersion through extensive exposure." Wait, maybe "the key is extensive immersion in it." Hmm, or "the key is immersing yourself in it through lots of exposure." Alternatively, "the key is consistent exposure." Let me think again. The original says "要靠大量浸淫" which is "rely on massive immersion." So maybe "There's no shortcut to learning a language; the key is consistent immersion." That sounds better.

Sentence 4: "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender." The structure here is a bit awkward. "Praises his girlfriend for her being very tender" could be rephrased as "praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for being so gentle." "Tender" might not be the best word here. "Gentle" or "kind" might be more natural. Also, "in front of his colleagues" is okay, but maybe "to his colleagues" is simpler. So "Siu-san praises his girlfriend to his colleagues for being so kind." Or "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for how gentle she is."

Sentence 5: "I take the metro to school every day." This one seems fine. It's simple and natural. No changes needed here.

Let me go through each again to make sure:

1. Original: "Why are you hurry? Why do you worry that they won't wait for you?" Suggested: "Why the rush? They’ll wait for you anyway." That's concise and natural.

2. Original: "He is a magnanimous person, he doesn't haggle over trivial issues with the kids." Suggested: "He’s magnanimous and doesn’t bother with petty arguments with others." "Others" instead of "the kids" might be better if "班𡃁仔" refers to peers or others in general.

3. Original: "There is no shortcut to learn a language; the key is massive exposure to it." Suggested: "There’s no shortcut to learning a language—immersion is key." That's more concise and uses "immersion" as per the original's "浸淫."

4. Original: "Siu-san praises his girlfriend in front of his colleagues for her being very tender." Suggested: "Siu-san praises his girlfriend to his colleagues for being so kind." "Kind" instead of "tender," and "to his colleagues" instead of "in front of" for simplicity.

5. No changes needed.

I think these adjustments make the sentences more natural and concise while keeping the original meaning.
