1. The text argues that God, as the creator of all possibilities, is a universal mechanism that nurtures existence, and humans are vessels for subjective experience (qualia). Suffering and evil are not objective realities but personal choices in perception, as individuals select what and how to experience within God's creation. Ultimately, one's current experience—including suffering—is self-chosen, and agency lies in recognizing and altering this choice.  

2. I disagree. While the text offers an intriguing perspective on subjective experience, it oversimplifies suffering by framing it as a choice, which can dismiss systemic injustices or unavoidable pain (e.g., disease, oppression). Not all suffering is perceptual; some are material realities beyond individual control, making the thesis feel detached from human complexity.  

3. *The Vessel's Choice*  
God spun the web, vast and wide,  
A stage where all truths hide.  
We sip the cup of "now" and "here,"  
And taste the joy—or doubt, or fear.  
For what we see, what we believe,  
Is but the soul’s own weave.  
To call it evil, call it pain,  
Is to dance in the mind’s domain.
