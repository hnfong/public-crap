Once upon a time, in a small village in the UK, there was a magical rainbow that appeared after every rain shower. The villagers loved this rainbow because it brought joy and hope to their hearts. The rainbow had seven vibrant colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Each color shone brightly, creating a beautiful arc across the sky.

The children in the village would run outside to see the rainbow, their faces filled with wonder. They would point and laugh, trying to touch the ends of the rainbow. The adults would pause their work to admire the natural beauty, feeling grateful for the simple pleasures in life.

One day, a little girl named Lily decided to follow the rainbow. She thought that if she could reach the end, she might find a pot of gold or a magical creature. She ran and ran, but the rainbow seemed to move away from her. Finally, she stopped and looked up. The rainbow was still there, but it was just as far away as before. Lily realized that the rainbow was a beautiful illusion, meant to be enjoyed from a distance.

From that day on, Lily and the other children learned to appreciate the rainbow for what it was: a fleeting moment of beauty in the sky. They would always stop and admire it, knowing that each rainbow was unique and special. The villagers continued to treasure these moments, and the rainbow became a symbol of happiness and unity in their community.
