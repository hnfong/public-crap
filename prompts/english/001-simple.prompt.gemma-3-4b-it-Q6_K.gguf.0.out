Okay, let’s tackle these questions!

**1. How high would you have to count before you would use the letter "A" in the English language spelling of a whole number?**

You’d have to count to **100**.

Here’s why:

*   Numbers 1-9 use only the letters B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.
*   The number 100 contains the letter "A" (in "hundred").

**2. Complete this sentence: "The quick brown fox ..."; What is the sentence famous for?**

“The quick brown fox **jumps over the lazy dog.**”

This sentence is famous because it’s a **pangram**. A pangram is a sentence that contains *every* letter of the alphabet at least once. It’s often used to test fonts, typewriters, and keyboards.


**3. Write a short story of the three little pigs who met the little red riding hood.**

The three little pigs, Pip, Pop, and Percy, were building their houses with a frantic energy. Pip, the youngest, was hastily stacking straw, Pop was piling up sticks, and Percy, the eldest and most sensible, was carefully laying bricks.  Suddenly, a flurry of red dashed past – it was Little Red Riding Hood, on her way to Grandma’s.

“Good heavens!” cried Percy, “You’re heading towards the woods! Be careful!”

Little Red Riding Hood, a bit startled, replied, “Thank you, Mr. Pig! I’m delivering a basket of honey cakes to my grandmother.”

Just then, a hungry wolf, smelling the delicious cakes, burst from the trees. He spotted Pip’s straw house and, with a mischievous grin, began to huff and puff.  Pip squealed and ran to Pop’s stick house, but the wolf was just as quick. He huffed and puffed, and the stick house tumbled down!

They scrambled to Percy’s brick house, and the wolf, finding it too sturdy to breach, let out a frustrated howl. Little Red Riding Hood, witnessing the chaos, bravely offered the pigs a piece of her honey cake. 

“Don’t worry,” she said, “I know a clever way to outsmart him.  Grandma always says, ‘A little kindness goes a long way.’”  She then distracted the wolf with a story about a particularly grumpy badger, giving the pigs time to barricade the door with bricks.  The wolf, thoroughly confused and craving cake, eventually wandered off in search of a less complicated meal.  The three little pigs, safe and sound, shared the honey cake with Little Red Riding Hood, realizing that sometimes, the best defense is a little bit of friendship.
