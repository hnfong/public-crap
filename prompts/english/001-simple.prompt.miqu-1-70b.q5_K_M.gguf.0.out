3. Once upon a time, the three little pigs decided to take a stroll in the forest. As they were wandering, they stumbled upon Little Red Riding Hood, who seemed to be lost. The pigs, being kind-hearted, offered to help her find her way.

Little Red Riding Hood thanked them and explained that she was on her way to her grandmother's house. The pigs knew the way and decided to accompany her, not wanting her to face any danger alone. As they walked, they chatted and laughed, and the pigs learned that Little Red Riding Hood was carrying a basket of goodies for her sick grandmother.

When they finally reached the house, they found that the door was open. Little Red Riding Hood entered first, followed by the pigs. To their surprise, they found the Big Bad Wolf in disguise as Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother!

The pigs quickly realized what was happening and sprang into action. They used their sharp teeth and strong bodies to chase the wolf out of the house and into the forest. With the wolf gone, Little Red Riding Hood was safe, and she was able to deliver the goodies to her grandmother.

From that day on, the three little pigs and Little Red Riding Hood became the best of friends, and they would often go on adventures together in the forest. [end of text]
